Ah so each block has multiple links to the previous block, each spread throughout the block and needing to be individually found and verified before the new block is accepted? 
And then each of these transactions are checked against my private key? Is that expensive? 
Does the client do any actively trying to remain defragmented when adding new blocks to the chain? I have no idea if that's something easy to achieve..


It really done, I've always wondered what was taking so long.

Is this generally considered a major flaw in the wallet? It seems to me that it would seriously deter people from exploring bitcoin..
@_date: 2012-06-11 09:00:26
This is really helpful, thanks! :)

Left on overnight with ~10 connections, it was still on the same block

If transaction fees are not great enough by 2032, there wont be enough incentive for much mining and a 51% attack becomes easy to achieve.
Or am I wrong? 
@_date: 2012-03-20 16:09:29
I've tried the rescan option already.
@_date: 2012-06-14 11:48:13
When a transaction fee is too low to be worth accepting, what happens to the transaction? Does it get returned to the sender, or are the bitcoins lost and awaiting confirmation forever? 
@_date: 2012-06-13 01:42:41
Obviously a huge amount of guesswork has to go into this, but I wonder if someone could tell me how much value would have to be being transferred around in 2032 for the mining incentive to be great enough  that a 51% is prohibitively expensive?

Some people in that thread discussing blacklisting the coins. How does that work? 
@_date: 2012-06-10 19:48:02


I assume there are a few more out there than the ~8 I seem to connect to?
@_date: 2012-11-09 13:27:13
Why do you think that? Reddit gold is mostly irrelevant even to reddit users.

From their website they don't seem to operate with GBP and Non-US charities. But what a great service! 
(for those not interested in looking it up: it seems they will set up a bitcoin address for you to take payments, convert them onto USD or EUR and pay you every working day. Taking a 3% fee. US registered charities are exempt from the fee)

I'm not really sure about whether it's technically possible to increase the maximum value of bitcoins (I believe that it is, just that it has to be widely accepted by miners?). 
But if there is a good reason to increase the limit, this reason could be explained and the proposed solution could be to distribute a new client that starts producing new bitcoins YYY days from that clients adoption.
I think that reduces the risk of destroying faith in crypo-currencies?

Had not heard of Zopa and the like. Very interesting.

How does this work? I have deposited some BTC into bitcoinica, but I haven't seen any interest. 
@_date: 2012-05-09 17:29:40
From the website it kind of implied I need a buy or sell order for the interest to happen? I only have 1.4 bitcoins anyway..

I just made a wallet. What does live status: disconnected mean?
@_date: 2012-06-24 08:43:13
Be sure to let godaddy know why you moved :)
@_date: 2012-05-18 18:31:48
As an aside from my previous comment..
Is it possible for bitcoin to be forked? With some coins going one way and some coins going the other?
@_date: 2012-05-17 15:03:49
Sorry, I posted that more for other redditors than for you. I should have made that clear. 
@_date: 2012-03-29 13:57:42
The app does look good though.
@_date: 2012-06-13 01:22:06
WOT = Web Of Trust? 
What is this? Could you provide a link?
@_date: 2012-06-10 19:44:41
Would I then just copy it to a folder in my wallet directory? 
@_date: 2012-06-22 12:15:21
How would passing the transaction to a miner help? I didn't know anything could be confirmed in under about 10minutes..
@_date: 2012-06-24 08:39:35
How does this work? What does blockchain.info do? 
Edit. I mean, how does it complete that process? Are the coins immediately gone from your wallet? What does the receiving friend see?
@_date: 2012-06-10 17:15:26
Why is that? why does it differ from any other download?
@_date: 2012-06-20 15:56:02
Is there a bitcoin lottery that uses numbers drawn from the real lottery? Publish the numbers each user has chosen and then pay out to the user which chose the numbers drawn in a popular real world lottery. 
Seems to me that is the best way to prove you're not cheating. Does that system exist? 
@_date: 2012-06-25 14:09:56


How does this work?
@_date: 2012-06-15 11:26:01
Blockchain.info allows this. A bit like a combo of online wallet and offline?

Was the last.fm password db in plaintext? They don't go into any details: 
Anywhere I can read more about that?
Was it the whole account information that went missing? Emails associated with accounts?
My passwords are slightly unique for each website, but it is only a simple pattern. Perhaps it's time for a new password system..
@_date: 2012-05-13 13:58:02
A bit too technical for me I'm afraid :(
Also I am curious about 'coins' I don't just have a balance I have a mix of various coins? 
When I send someone some money they receive a few bitcoins and send me some back? 
All quite confusing.
@_date: 2012-06-22 15:16:50
Aha, so if you sent the tx to all the big pools it would be impossible for him to double spend unless he somehow managed to send the second tx to another miner and produced the block first? 
I didn't know that when you sent a transaction to a node/miner it would immediately respond saying it was a double spend.
Edit: please forgive my ignorance if I am misunderstanding.
Edit 2, may reveal the extent of my lack of understanding: when tx fees are a major part of miner incomes, might unscrupulous pools allow double spends by accepting whichever tx has a greater fee attached? 
@_date: 2012-05-17 15:09:31
There is a video of it in use [on their blog](
@_date: 2012-05-09 18:18:56
Do you know the minimum?

 can request money using NFC but I don't know if you can pay with it yet. I imagine you can.

I updated the client the other day

I hope this isn't stealing from dropbox. He is probably buying advertising from google and advertising the referral links. Meaning that he is paying to introduce those people to dropbox.
The double your referral space is dubious though. Dropbox generously doubles the referral space of anyone with a .edu email address, so he is probably abusing that offer.

I asked wikimedia UK about bitcoin donations and received this reply:






 &gt;1)   The cost of doing so would vastly outweigh the potential benefit in donations received.
 &gt;2)   Out reporting requirements are extremely complex. Our auditors and the Charity Commission struggle with OpenOffice documents as a concept - can you imagine how they'd feel about Bitcoins?










I very briefly asked if wikimedia UK had considered bitcoins, and referred to the link posted by Cowboy_Coder about wikemedia NYC. My email was merely two lines and I this was the response within minutes. I am very impressed!
edit: he sent a follow up saying:

Disappointed this isn't in the uk. Soon I hope :)

I would love to read more about this. Any suggested links?
What information does a bitcoin transaction reveal? Could I follow my bitcoins around for the sake of my own curiosity?

Things like the mechanics of transaction fees and 'coin age' I have never understood. Is there somewhere to go to read about these sort of deeper mechanics to bitcoin?
