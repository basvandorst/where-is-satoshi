Kevin de Leon is a corporate hack who literally hates everywhere but the coastal regions of CA.
Vote for Alison Hartson. She's the one we need to primary Feinstein out.

I think there's some fundamental differences between the Dutch tulip mania and bitcoin though.
The tulips were simply a fashion statement - a fashionable status symbol for the Dutch upper class. Bitcoin is fundamentally different because it provides a useful function that the tulips did not; therefore, there is a greater intrinsic value to Bitcoin. The tulip bubble was also a fad that lasted months - hardly the same could be said about Bitcoin.
The implementation of futures contracts, I predict, will be a good thing. Ultimately, these contracts are just agreements to purchase bitcoins at a set price in the future. The purchaser hopes that the value of that contract at the time of execution is greater than the purchase price, thus he makes a profit. The exchange benefits because they get the money for the contract at the time of purchase, which they can turn around and invest, thus earning a profit.
I don't see how this can damage Bitcoin other than maybe providing some prediction in the prices (based on the contract prices), and it will definitely increase Bitcoin's capital since investors will have a new, big-name vehicle for investment in Bitcoin.
I'll admit that I'm a novice investor, these are just my thoughts I'm bouncing around here. I'd love to hear what everyone's thoughts on this are.

Good luck. Hopefully your senator isn't a corporate sellout like most of them already are (is it Bernie Sanders?)
Banter aside, good on you for trying to educate the government on this issue. Have an upvote because I'm poor af right now lol

Your grandmother sat next to Steve Forbes on an airplane? Flying coach? 
Also I can't find any publication of Steve Forbes' or Forbes magazine indicating that he claims Bitcoin is a fraud - I did find this [article]( in Forbes written by a contributor, which has some criticisms of Bitcoin as a currency.
Seems like fear/caution over not understanding it more than anything. My parents are skeptical as well for the same reasons.

All of these things happen under the current centralized monetary system. Decentralizing the currency, in my opinion, adds stability because the rules are based on consensus, not central bank policy.

It's funny to me because some people think that just because they wrote to their Senator, the Senator should immediately comply with their demands.
Like, do you really think your voice is that big? This is why voting is more important than anything. Who cares what some random constituents say if they aren't voting for you anyway?
They would listen to a bunch of citizens' demands if those citizens actually took their own threats seriously and vote the corrupt ones out.

The letter 'μ' is just called "mu", maybe call it that?
Like 100 μBTC would be 100 Mu.

You would declare the income made from the sale of the Bitcoin as a capital gain. That's what I meant to say, perhaps I should have been more clear.

The fact that his biggest donors are the Teachers and Nurses Unions actually concerns me quite a bit more. Case in point, De Leon does not care about all Californians. When asked about the High Speed Rail Initiative, he had this to say about folks living in the Central Valley, where I currently live:


Yeah, actually *millions* of people live out here. De Leon doesn't give a shit about the farmers and other working-class folk that actually feed a good portion of the country, in a region that desperately needs investment in things like infrastructure and education. He will not have my vote.

Fun fact, the joke was also stolen from OP acknowledged that though.

Why do you need a lawyer, and why did you have literally all of your property seized? Surely you'd have thought of that beforehand.


As determined by the *court*. The court and the police department are not the same thing. You do get to make an argument in court, but you also cannot expect to just get whatever amount you say it's worth.


That's what I meant when I referred to declaring property on your taxes. Profit made from buying &amp; selling Bitcoin is considered a capital gain as far as I'm aware, because Bitcoin is considered to be property and not a currency by the IRS; though I may be wrong about how some of that works.

If the government illegally seizes your property and you can prove it, and they are unable to return it to you, then you are entitled generally entitled to monetary damages up to the value of that property.
That said, this law is moot. It's already technically illegal to conceal your Bitcoin because it's considered as property by the IRS. You have to declare it on your taxes, therefore you cannot technically conceal it legally even now.
All that said though, fuck Dianne Feinstein. That old corporate hack needs to gtfo of the Senate.

Tai Lopez has always been a fraud. How anyone hasn't seen that from the first time they've seen one of his ads is beyond me, let alone staying relevant.
