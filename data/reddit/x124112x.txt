Time to hit up BitPremier.

This person isn't even trying. You can make it say from "mailer or whatever if you wanted to.

We have to find a lightweight way to put one line of characters next to a Bitcoin logo on our website.

Well... shit.

Bloomberg? Get that shit out of here.

Those things are pieces of shit. Don't buy this unless you want to inhale plastic fumes.
EDIT: Sorry, I must have not seen the "Bitcoin" in the title. GPens are the greatest product ever, and you should buy at least 5. /circlejerk

Buy it back from him for 10% less than BitStamp price.

This looks promising. 1 call per second may not be enough, so I will be contacting them for a quote on Pro. I'm sure it won't be as much as CoinKite, and everything is unlimited.

Oh. I was more interested in human jerky.

If I lived in Alaska, I'd let you insulate the shit out of my house.

The Federal Reserve shouldn't even have a fucking Bitcoin policy.

So you're telling me that I can buy/sell Bitcoin at that ATM with only a semen, blood, hair, fingerprint, and retina sample?
Count me in!
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:24:18
Based in US, so no point.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:00:25


Wait... are you telling me there's a market where I can buy human flesh?

Oooh is it AMA time?
Can I buy some dank cannabis with my Bitcoin? Or is that still against the terms of use of Basecoin©, which my BTC is converted to?

I hope this ends the Coinbase circlejerk.
