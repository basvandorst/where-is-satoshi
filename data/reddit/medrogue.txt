This is radical shit guys . . stay smart. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:32
jesus . . shit like that prolly cause the volatile drops
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:15:50
bruh, pls tell me you see this bubble . . how high do you think this bubble could surge?? 
People are saying this bubble is gonna top off at 20-25k . . But I think it could reach 100k-500k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:50:31
I just put down another grand at 14k :0
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:16:50
I agree, I’m just praying I can jump ship accordingly. I’m thinking of jumping ship when it hits 50k . . . and just buying myself a proper house.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:21:55
It's 800 bucks worth. Should I put it all into bitcoin? :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:31:43
Can you explain this a little more. I always thought NN was a good thing for the consumer. How would keeping NN in place hurt bitcion?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:22
It wouldn’t, with the current transaction fees, there’s no reason to use bitcoin. Just hodl and convert to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:54:16
This is a common fallacy within a bubble. People see the price keep increasing and believe the risk has subsided. 
But it’s actually a huge red flag. As price increases rapidly like this . . so does the risk.
I’d love if bitcoin just relaxes at this price for two weeks, perhaps that could mean bitcoin has found a new resting spot . . but the fact it’s still so volatile means we’re indeed in a super bubble. 
The fact that it broke 17k is small potatoes, don’t you even sell yet!
I honestly believe this bubble could reach unimaginable heights, maybe even 80k-100k by the end of jan! 
That’s when we sell baby!! We swimming with the whales!!
So grab the closes beluga whale, and doggy fuck it into submission you hodling sun of a bitch!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:48:46
I’m not expecting this high to last. It’s gonna crash to maybe 7k - 8k sometime this month. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:27:06
I’ve now made close to 8k from november alone!! :D so this is an amazing ride
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:05:32
The second one of my maids or gardeners tell me they’re buying bitcoin . . I’m selling.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:35:38
Go to gdax??
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:47:51
Nobody notices this is an ad . . . .okk
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:21:39
You’re not thinking straight if you don’t see this is a bubble. I’m just wondering when bitcoin will run out of new investors and take a huge dive. 
This growth isn’t being driven by anything else than yuppies that read the daily headline and decided to invest now.
I’m thinking this traction is going to die sometime in Janurary. I’m just trying to think how large this bubble will get, maybe 80-100k. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:36:15
Get out of here you geezer! Bitcoin is for millennials! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:03:35
That’s the problem right now, new yuppies like you are being trained to buy in when the price drops. 
They’re fueling this upward trend we see new, it’s just about “when” does this upward trend end? 
When do we run out of new yuppies?? Or when do big whales sitting on millions of dollars worth of BTC decide to sell and plunge the value back to that in 2016?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:48:05
I don’t think you even understand what I said.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:24:10
thanks, does the green mean they’re selling or buying??
And is the volume in btc?!! I just saw someone buy 8 btc i think
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:48:57
For sure :3 at least now u know
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:21
I gotta admit I have a really bad gaming addiction :/
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:51:18
Yup me too, I think I’ll definitely buy then. All I know is that it’s definitely going to crash.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:52:52
7k is my price point, just looking at the speculative aspects of it in the past week. This is gonna crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:47:14
so euro? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:25
Hodl gahd damn it!! Hodl!!! I’ve got 4k worth right now from just november!!!! Woohoo!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:42:11
It can’t, it’s literally unsustainable . . . 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:56
How far do you think this bubble will go? I honestly think it’ll hit 80k-100k by the end of janurary.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:01:37
Yes. Im trying to be careful. I also don't believe Coinbase will uphold their side of the bargain if shit hits the fan and I lose all my money. 
What's the benefit of something like Trezor or Ledger over a normal usb?? 
I would prefer to have it all on a normal USB or several USBs. I just like the control/idea of myself doing it from scratch. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:16
when are u gonna sell??
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:01:05
How do you see the buying orders?? Is it on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:41:44
Ah I see. I suppose you also live in a rural place yourself, given your concern. 
But I agree and feel like the FCC is just pushing to remove NN as soon as possible without really ironing out the kinks. 
I'd honestly like NN to just go away so we can see how the scenario plays out. I mean, either way we learn a valuable lesson in a new frontier. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:18
Is that it? How do I create one?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:22
Wait nigga, what you on about . . did it hit 19???? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:18:26
I agree, the morons thinking this will crash at 20k don’t realize the traction bitcoin will get once the yuppies return from college.
I’m expecting a huge surge, upwards of 80-100k . . . maybe even more. But I’m definitely selling if it reaches 80k . . I’ll just go buy myself a proper house.
Hell, I have an aunt that’s always late to the party on all investments, if she mentions it, I’m jumping ship.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:12
people are saying this bubble could go up ton500k . . I know the mcafee guy, recommending bitcoin is a fucking fraud.
He obviously wants all the yuppies to invest in bitcoin so he can cash out. Fuckin asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:45:03
I’ll give you a quick lesson. You could prolly write a simple python program yourself. 
Let’s say I invest 10 bucks at 17k. The amount of bitcoin I’d have would be
(10/17k) BTC
Ok, but what if it goes up to 19k . . how much would my bitcoin now be worth?
Well don’t worry, I’ll show ya!!
(10/17k) = (x/19k) 
Where x is your new value of money @ 19k.
(10/17k) * 19k = x 
x would be about 11 bucks. 
With variables it’d be 
(A/B) * C = x
A = Initial investment
B = Initial price of BTC @ time of investment
C = Current price of BTC
X = Current value of BTC in dollars 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:43:36
I'd disagree. Most people buy Bitcoin these day to just hodl and get them sweet gains, doesn't make sense to invest otherwise lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:22:57
So wait, in 2013 he loses 6k worth of bitcoin and never invests again?? I call bullshit on this story.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:43:11
Sure, but if you make any type of profit, you’ve already beat the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:56:48
You know what. I’ll try this for a week. Kinda perfect since finals are coming up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:16:27
It’s been at 16 for a week . . probably, sell sell sell
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:44
Mark Cuban hasn’t invested because there’s still too much risk, and he’s a pretty busy man . . .
