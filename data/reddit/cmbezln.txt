Most people I know who use market cap in chosing trades typically use it in conjunction with news or rumors on low cap alt coins, obviously there are thousands of shitcoins out there with tiny caps that will never move up in price

Gotcha, ok much thanks
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:54:03
Oh cool, I'll let literally everyone over at know that you said they're doing it wrong.  Thanks professor crypto!
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:23:16
So now you've graduated from "everybody except me is a retard" to "I know you are but what am I?"...
Man, you sound like the type of guy I should be taking investing advice from! 
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:36:23
I don't know what your deal is, but you need to look up the *meaning* of the word *meaning*, because market cap has a definitive *meaning*.
And that meaning has value to people who know what they're *doing*
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:31:35
Haha yes, the ol "I'm right and everyone else is retarded" shtick.  It works pretty well when you're 10, not really a good look for an adult trying to feign expertise in investment.

Yeah it broadcasted almost right away, just never got any confirmations...based on the other comments though it sounds like GDAX hasn't caught up with the new higher fees.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:37:49
Damn I hope they can get to these soon... Lightning cant get here soon enough, this is nuts

Most anybody who understands trading sees market cap as an indicator for potential profits.  A small market cap coin has a greater profit potential than a large cap coin in most cases.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:51:14
It was just weird that my txns were going faster when there was low mining priority and higher volume is all, wanted to make sure something wasn't going on with how GDAX was broadcasting them 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:05:57
Only an idiot would think it would predict that or even think people thought it would predict that.  *Ahem*
That's not at all what people look at cap size for.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:56:01
Market cap will easily tell you profit potential for most any given coin.  A coin with a small market cap has a much greater potential for increasing in value than a coin with a high market cap.

The fact that you can't read perfectly formed sentences says more about you then it does about me.
Hey man, by the way...did you know that, like....coin prices aren't even real?!
Totally made up BS.  Also, blockchain is just this made up thing that doesn't have meaning.
We're not even having this conversation right now!

I found about 100,000 dogecoins in an old wallet last week
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:40:28
strange how everyone there seems to take market cap into consideration when you've clearly stated it has "zero meaning"
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:45:13
Hey, $1500 is $1500.  Lucky I found it when doge was surging

I just used "we" instead of "you guys" so it didn't sound like I was trying to insult people, I wasn't any part of it.

Yeah im actually looking at information now, long term ive been meaning to but short term i was just trying to move that btc (which I was finally able to, thankfully)
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:25:33
what does that have to do with coinami, though?
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:08:01
Some guy on Twitter said to get out of bitcoin because it'll sit at 13k a week ago and then everybody started mocking him when it soared past 13k shortly after that....but since then it's settled right back down to 13k again for days  lol

a bit more background:  These watches are produced by Franck Muller and are personalized with your personal bitcoin wallet public address.  This is insinuating that the person who had this watch made has access to this widely-known mtgox wallet.
Link below shows that Saudis and UAE reps were meeting in UAE to discuss an official cryptocurrency over the last week.  
Previous tweets from supercar blondie tags and insinuates she was with Turki Al-Sheikh, a saudi royal court advisor. 
Is it possible this person, or somebody in the Royal family is connected to the mtgox debacle? 
Here is the previous tweet im referencing:
Here is the article detailing the meeting between House of Saud and UAE:
edit: Looking even further into her previous tweets, it looks like she was with the Saudis in Riyadh for an exotic car show.  Is it possible she caught a ride down to UAE with them for the meeting they had to attend?  I would bet that's the case.

One might look to the recently declassified CIA documents where we learned they have been researching psychokinesis, remote viewing and the like going back years and overtly claim in said documents that they believe there to proof of psychic abilities in humans.  Obviously the CIA is not academia and isn't about to submit their work for peer review, but an interesting claim none-the-less and probably dwarfs individual academic research in scale.


Oh, ok.


Of course it's fucking baseless, it's literal predictions.  The "base" for his predictions is the data mined by his web bots.  Did you even read any of what I wrote beyond looking for "gotchas"?
You honestly think that in the middle of last year it would be *obvious* that a group of officials within the government would start pushing disclosure dialogue about UFOs?  What's your evidence for that, because literally nobody else saw that coming that I know of, even people who actively lobby the government for disclosure.
Also, I don't even understand what you're arguing against here, regardless of the likelihood of these events happening (and in spite of things like the press overwhelming bashing trump at the time we wrote that report, claiming that were heading for WW3 with DPRK and not at all mentioning the likelihood of peace agreements), the web bots successfully aggregated data and made accurate predictions about what would happen.  
Would could have 100 scenarios where there are very binary actions possible, with many people knowing 1 of the 2 options could very well happen, and if the web bots successfully predict the outcome of said scenarios using the methodology he employs, then the web bots still have value and are still pointing toward the legitimacy of his methods. 
He's well known in crypto because he's been accurate in predicting price action in the past.  Everybody knows its going to either go up or down, but if he can tell us with some level of accuracy which direction its going to go and by how much that lends validity to his methods.

I'm not sure how much research you have done into this but his basic premise is that we are part of a collective consciousness (as described by jung) and individuals have psychic abilities that leak through our dialogue, and by analyzing word clouds essentially, we can pick up on some of these.
I think it's pretty foolish to just sit there and say the idea is "retarded".  Is Carl Jung retarded?  What gives you the authority to write off Jung's ideas as such?


It flew under the radar but it was pretty significant.  
People currently in the CIA disclosing secret programs to study UFOs within the last 10 years.  Disclosure of metals recovered from a crashed UFO that they claim to be unable to identify.  Releasing classified video footage from the military of supposed UFOs.
Why would you write something like that off as "baseless" when you haven't even looked into it?  It that reasonable?


Sure he's gotten things wrong, but you should read one of his reports from last year and you'd be surprised to see what percentage of it is "accurate".  He's dealing with vague terms here and basically drawing upon his knowledge to interpret what they could be pointing at, and I think that action of his translation is what often breaks down (even though he's a pretty knowledgeable guy).  Most of what he describes in the reports arent specific predictions and most of the time im not even paying attention to his interpretation because the word itself is already recognizable among current events...and then you have the very oddly specific stuff like the UFO disclosure that was so out of left field and somehow showed up in current events not even a few months later.   Just that "prediction" alone was pretty compelling to me.
Again, there's a lot of very specific words that show up in his data that have nebulous meaning that's kind of up to you (or someone familiar) to interpret.  I think you have this idea that these reports are him just spouting off predictions like "i am clif high and this this and that is going to happen next month) etc, when really he just reports on the more compelling data and sometimes briefly extrapolates what they could be pointing to.
I have never personally been swayed by people who claim to be psychic predictors, but I do believe there to be something to Jung's idea of a collective conscious and the reports of his I was given were compelling enough to make me think there's something to his methodology.

sorry the URL gets screwed up when you search archives.  Here's what I'm talking about:
You can't just blanket excuse anything you see as "confirmation bias".  The data showed strong emphasis on visible puslations in the atmosphere.  2 Months later we had very rare pulsations in the atmosphere, lol.
It's like someone saying a 20 foot baby from space landed on the white house lawn and then you just writing it off as confirmation bias.  Sure it's an easy out for you, but I think that's intellectually dishonest.

Back in the day, the only wallet available was QT (later called core) and your Bitcoin basically resided on a wallet.dat file that you could optionally encrypt with a password.
I never managed to find mine, though I did recover my dogecoin QT mining wallet from late 2013 that had a couple Grand worth of doge on it...shrug

Since you're not getting any legitimate answers from OP, I'll fill you in out of respect.  
I've only been recently introduced to Clif, he created a system/program that crawls parts of the internet, mainly searches and social media, to collect linguistics data and then has an algorithm that looks for asymmetrical data (like if someone on a hunting forum uses the word "Apocalypse" or "other worldly" etc and groups them together into sub groups in order to find words that don't belong.
The idea and premise is that all humans have psychic abilities (an idea that is actually not all that crazy and has data to support it) and that we unknowingly "leak" information about future events.
He uses this data to publish reports about predictions related to crypto and it's pretty accurate.
I just got done reading his crypto report back from september and watched a couple videos from mid last year of his and he predicted the meteoric rise of bitcoin and altcoins in oct/nov, event charted it out in a fairly accurate manner.   He predicted we will be going through many corrective phases in early this year, tapering off in February and that in late feb/march bitcoin will take off.  He also predicted that we would see a similar oct/nov this year like we did last year, which is obviously a very good thing
He used to release ALTA reports that predicted all sorts of very strange things.  The last one I read from september was eerie in that he predicted things like the coordinated effort of people in government to leak information about UFOs (which they did, releasing video and claiming to have unknown metals collected from UFO crashes), predicted a giant hole forming in Antarctica, predicted North Korea restoring ties with South Korea, and a whole host of other oddly specific predicitons that came to fruition.

To be honest, I was around for MtGox, i got interested in it in late 2012.  I was just an idiot and wasn't following closely until it was too late and thought it was dead.
Even in those times there was a sentiment that keeping it in a wallet was best practice.  I had bitcoin and never put it on an exchange, kept it in a wallet (which is now on a harddrive in a landfill somewhere because im a stupid idiot).   
But yeah, lotta people got screwed
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:49:21
in addition to what i pointed out in my last post, another oddly specific thing in a report from late last year I read was that there would be visible pulsations in the atmosphere coming from the poles, and then just a few weeks ago i see this from the spaceweather feed im subscribed to in my inbox
These pulsations are very rare events.

If you were on Reddit around that time you would have heard about it.  I remember a few frontpage posts about it very early on.  Obviously people didn't take it as seriously as they should have
