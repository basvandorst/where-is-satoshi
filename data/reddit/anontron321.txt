Not with the mobile app, I would need electrum or a hardware wallet to do so.

Thank you. Just hope it doesn't happen to anyone else.

thanks for looking out though, that would of been an easier route for sure.

Not on my mobile wallets. But for future reference apparently Mycilium has a way to sign messages, none of the other mobile wallets do though from my understanding.

I let them know on their slack chan. Doubt I'll get anything but just hope it doesn't happen to others.

Brutal but lesson learned. Don't think I'll be using Airbitz anymore. My fault for not double checking, just never had that issue before. Have always used high priority without anything that drastic happening.

Did not know that, will check it out thanks.

Yea, it seems like it's on their end not Airbitz's.

Sucks indeed. It got confirmed quick, don't remember exact time but think it was within minutes.

Just to throw some context in, this Stock Market club costs $4,000+ for their "premium membership" with a $400-$500 a year maintenance fee and is run by a guy named Mark Skousen, who apparently is a economic mastermind. 
They always promote Gold and Silver stocks and big corporate stocks and overall my grandfather did ok from some of their stock picks. They also have weekly conference calls and in 2014 I asked my grandfather to mention Bitcoin to Mark during the Q&amp;A portion of their conference call. When he asked, Mark said it was highly volital which it was at the time and to NOT touch it, so my grandfather never really got into it even though I was mining it at the time with an Avalon miner and tried to convince him to invest in it. 
Never the less, if my Grandfather had put that $4000 into Bitcoin in 2014 instead of this "elite club" he would be doing quite well today.

Not sure, but wouldn't surprise me.
