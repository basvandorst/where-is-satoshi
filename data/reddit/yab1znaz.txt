So Classic is XT now?
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:28:00
I'm a huge core supporter. But this is true. In the long term it would be nice to see some true competition to extend the protocol. 
XT and Classic were pathetic and transparent shill attempts to hijack the protocol and it has become bleedingly obvious that these are either state or banker attacks. If anything they have made core stronger.

@_date: 2016-01-20 22:45:43
What's the rush; capacity is not consistently reached. Just wait a couple of weeks to see the initial test results of SegWitness. 2mb will only get you a couple more TX per sec - whereas SegWitness will make eventually blocksize increases even more effective. Why throw out the devs over just 1 more MB? (it was 20 mB and then 8MB). This shit is just political and attempt by insidious banker backed forces to break up bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:37:07

@_date: 2016-01-17 10:06:30
As far as I can tell, there is no Bitcoin classic out there - or atleast anything that is significantly different from what core is already testing in the 2mb range. Bitcoin "Classic" (lulz) is a last ditch effort to hijack the conversation ala XT - which is dead now that the Hearnia has excused himself. Bitcoin Classic is a basically the other side admitting defeat. BecAuse when core rolls out 2mb (along with segwitness) then the other side will say "see - we told you 2mb was the right size".

@_date: 2016-01-20 22:11:27
They just said they are fine to 2mb increase. They haven't pledged anything to Classic - because the code hasn't even been released yet.

Yes Market Prices are an efficient indicator, but you just make your assumption - i.e., its all Core's fault - the truth. Which is bullshit and also just a random opinion. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:42:35
The crisis is also manufactured. The network is rarely at capacity so there is no pressure for consensus, atleast at the moment. This tantrum by Mike Hearn (on his way to a bank job) is just to seize atleast partial control and fork without consensus - which Is incidentally a good way to break the community. The large increases in block size proposed by XT also introduces more unforeseen results. We have not reached consensus, that's all. This whole failure talk is baloney. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:02:31
So if you find that you couldn't reason with those same engineers in spite of test evidence, at what point do you think that this discussion is no longer in good faith and that there might be something more sinister going on. And then one of their engineer rage quits to go join Horse/Buggy cabal? This whole situation is very suspect.

This exactly. Another coup attempt indeed and a desperate one - they don't even have code yet for review. They only have propaganda - picking up from where XT's corpse lies.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:13:23
If they can provide tested code that can demonstrate mitigations against known vulnerabilities of a large block size increase, then I'm sure Core would be interested. 
Remember that these same Classic guys just a few days ago were the XT guys who were advocating for a huge 8mb jump and before an even bigger 20mb jump. Again - these were create already known vulnerabilities. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:57:31
This exactly. I'm a rather uneducated bitcoiner who was on the fence about the debate - this little tantrum just because people disagree makes me believe even more that the Core devs might doing the right thing and waiting for true consensus. Last I checked everything is still working fine. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 21:02:53
How many issues have been brought up with block size and the burden it will put on the network. Yet, we still come back to it like its a simple solution. Please provide a paper (preferably with testable code) where you explain how we can overcome these challenges and then maybe Core will pay some attention.
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:40:46

"Classic" is admission of defeat from the other side. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:28:14
No code yet and once they do publish it will probably just be core + 2mb. Whoop dee fucking do.
Classic is just another attempt to seize control by essentially the same people after XT miserably failed.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:23:42
Its an opinion because it isn't reality that needs to be addressed now. The network is up and running and hasn't "failed".
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:45:02
Vast majority - except the miners. Miners want to increase blocksize like everyone else, but are sticking with core. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:20:43
Its working fine now. Just pay the recommended fee. Why introduce security and centralization vulnerabilities by introducing larger blocks when they are already more elegant methods to increase capacity without increasing block security and centralization risks. And anyway after a few months you will have to increase the block size yet again. It makes no sense. We know we need off chain solutions to get anywhere close to the Visa type 40,000 txs per sec. So lets finish work on that - we are getting close anyway. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:04:55
Its not the easiest way. There are security vulnerabilities - denial of service related. Gavin has proposed a solution, because we haven't seen any testing ala segnet. Let's see the results of testing first before a hard fork - a reasonable request.
LN can bring you at least 100 tx/sec (much more) without having to increase the block size. Lets start with that.

What war? Network is up and running and not at capacity (atleast not consistently). No pressure for consensus yet.
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:43:01
Capacity is being added via SegWitness - without the need to deal with the aforementioned vulnerabilities. Blocks are getting full but not consistently, no need to make a rash jump in block size when we have time to try out the promising SegWitness. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:21:17

@_date: 2016-01-19 21:08:07
Increasing the blocksize presents several security vulnerabilities - that must be addressed regardless of how some may argue about economics and politics. But of course, they scream about economics but have no answer as to how to deal with the security vulnerabilities. 
This is not indicative of a debate in full faith - rather it is indicative of shilling. I suggest you look up what shilling means - but that is basically what is happening. The banks are hiring shillers to break up the environment from within and while they are able to convince non-technical users, they do not fool the greater developer community, including core. Reddit is a great place for shilling.

@_date: 2016-01-23 02:01:10
SegWit and LN are excellent adaptations to the capacity without the need to expand block size which starts to introduce security and centralization vulnerabilities. LN is designed to be an offchain agreement until it is broadcast as a transaction to the network (thus limiting the burden on the network); it is not going to force a larger block size for a long time. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:57:14
Got it; apologies for the passive aggressive reply. Those folks use all the tools available for their propaganda and trolling is part of that.
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:51:40
Yeah just wait a bit instead of introducing security and decentralization vulnerabilities associated with a block size increase.
@_date: 2016-01-25 21:06:11
Can't wait!
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:09:31
That is just your opinion. No need to increase blocksize and throw out SegWit and LN because of it. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:08:33
I wouldn't say mad; I'd say brainwashed. They probably don't understand that the big bankers 1)would love to split the community and 2) introduces hard forks with known vulnerabilities (ala XT, Classic, etc.).  
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:11:31
|price appreciation which would occur when the market gets confident that Bitcoin will scale. 
This is as assumption; the 2mb limit only buys you a few txs per sec (not to mention introduce security and decentralization vulnerabilities) and we will be back to the same argument in just a few months. I don't see value in kicking the can down the road for a few months. SegWit and LN looks much more promising for a long term approach.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:50:30
Well, I'm strapped in - go ahead and hit me with the facts.
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:42:42
Then raise it after the hard drives (and processor) tech goes up. No need to break the one computer one node rule just yet. LN + segwitness will be old news by end of year. Chill dawg.

"Big blockers want 2MB then SegWit, rather than SegWit followed by 2MB"
Have you even read the article? Segwit would fix a lot of block size increase problems (via the malleability fix). After which we can think about increasing the blocksize. Simple logic. That's why people think this Classic, XT shit is disingenuous - because no one can be that stupid. I'm all for deleting this kind of crap. Because its not debate, its propaganda if anything.

I'd like you to backup your statement of "needn't involve allowing larger individual transactions". Don't quote XT - we know what happened to that shit idea and is now dead. Also - there was no testing being done on any scale for time-to-verify. So I'm wondering why you want to throw out a good idea like SegWit - I'm sure you have some proper rationale.

I don't think its cynical at all. Cui Bono makes it pretty obvious.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:06:47
1) Rare. Also you could just increase the fee by a couple of cents and you wouldn't have to wait. That is why it is called a fee market.
2) Not true - roadmap was signed off by 54 devs and obviously nobody gave a shit about XT.
3) Segwit initial results due in a couple of weeks. They are testing at Princeton Univ I believe. XT, Unlimited, Classic, whatever have not any sort of scale testing.
4) Irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:12:31
It was a fork away from the version managed by core initiated by Mike Hearn and Gavin Anderson. It was a reckless ballooning of the block size starting at 8mb and doubling every two years. When time came to adopt, none of the miners did of course and XT is now dead (followed up with rage quitting by Mike Hearn).
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:04:48

Well, they know that we know what they are up to. So I believe they might change tactics. They might go bigger and be more aggressive and more violent. Either there will be rumblings in the govt about banning bitcoin - or perhaps worse case scenario, start going after the devs themselves. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:04:39
Only technical consensus is required; nuclear scientists don't design nuclear reactors based on merely opinion. If an opinion is put forth, consensus will gather only if all the negative implications can be mitigated (8mb block size introduces all kinds of vulnerabilities that the XT devs provided no solutions for - therefore, that opinion no longer can be considered valid). Of course, feel free to moan about it in another subrebbits. I for one am glad that is cleaning out the trash.
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:21:42
That is just bullshit about segwit. Overtime leads to bugs is your argument. Segwit will take too much time. Just conjecture. Meantime, 2mb doesn't solve the problem t all - just delays it a few months. Miners will stick to core because their roadmap provides long term solutions. 2mb classic is just a coup attempt with no roadmap or long term solutions.
@_date: 2016-01-30 04:56:08
With side-chains, yes. 1MB will also help fight government censorship.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:42:59

Nah. We got sidechains being developed. We can keep transactions offchain till it absolutely needs to be on-chain. Read the Lightning Network whitepaper.

You are on to something. The parasitic nature of it all betrays their true objectives.

I think I'm going to take my exchange business to a competitor now.
