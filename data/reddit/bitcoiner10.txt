It's a new protocol (with an open-source reference implementation) for a distributed financial exchange built on top of bitcoin. Proof-of-burn is a way to achieve a fair distribution of the initial currency: the developers make no gain from the BTC invested.

The counterparty protocol allows you to make transactions that wouldn't be possible just using BTC. For example, when placing an order on the exchange, the protocol automatically puts your XCP in escrow. This means that when you see an order on the counterparty market, you do not need to trust that the other party will pay. The fact that the order is validated by the counterparty protocol is proof that you will be paid if you place a counterorder. This is what it means to have a trustless exchange with no middlemen, you can't do that with BTC.

Yes, no more XCP can be created by burning BTC at this point.

The same reason why the value of bitcoin rises (or falls). Owning XCP lets you participate in the distributed exchange.

You have to trust the person who issues the asset, of course, in the same sense that you trust a company that issues a stock. The *exchange* is decentralized, which means you do not need to trust any middlemen, clearing houses, stock brokers, etc.

There's more detailed discussion in the bitcointalk thread, but a bitcoin address is just a string with a checksum at the end. The devs chose 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and computed the checksum UWLpVr to make it a valid address. It's not true that generating a valid address means that you've generated the private key.

XCP (Counterparty coins) were created by provably destroying BTC, as opposed what others have done with sending BTC directly to the developers. The burn period is now over, no more XCP will be created. The counterparty protocol allows you to trade XCP for BTC and other user-created assets in a distributed marketplace.

Yes, any bitcoin address can receive XCP. To send XCP or use the exchange, the address currently needs to be in your bitcoind wallet.

Yes! The counterparty protocol implements a distributed exchange over the bitcoin blockchain. This is working now using a command-line client.

See my reply to GuideZ.

If there's one thing you can say about the CounterParty protocol, it's that it's trustless. Unlike with Mastercoin, the XCP protocol doesn't involve sending a fee to the devs with every transaction. XCP is also built on top of the BTC blockchain and doesn't try to invent any new cryptography.

Not an ELI5, but you can trade assets and make bets without worrying that the person you're trading with (the counterparty) will pay. The protocol itself, built on top of the bitcoin blockchain, handles the escrow without needing to trust any middlemen.

The "proof" is that the address 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr is a vanity address that would be essentially impossible to generate by chance. If you could generate a private key for this address, you could generate one for *any* bitcoin address, and bitcoin would be broken.
