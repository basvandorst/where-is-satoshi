This is a problem. Currently if you want to make a transaction the counterparty has to have the same provider of the next layer or pay high fees to get on layer-0. So now they will be looking for alternatives.


I didn't see anything, It's either obscure or your taking things out of context. 


Then disagreement means nothing if there is no way to implement change. That is why Ver is working to create a community that wants to bring capacity increases to the network. 


This doesn't even make sense. How can you link their desire to expand the capacity of the network on chain with slowing down capacity increases?
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:36:29


Agreed. But it is not an issue for small balances. If you have any significant value stored in BTC you can easily afford a node. Again, you shouldn't look at this as an absolute. Security is related to potential loss. You don't store your loose change in a safe.


No. The higher the fee the less interest there will be in the network. Having some people not using a full node has nothing to do with fees. demand v capacity links fees. I want demand to increase and we therefore need capacity to increase for the exact reason that high fees are bad for demand.


Everyone can have an opinion. I think trust is relative to commitment. if i only had a few satoshi's it is not worth running a full node to verify the chain and using other storage mechanisms is fine. 


Both want to see demand for the network increase because utility is the only way a currency will have long term value. Your paypal comments are pretty weird, there is no way to turn BTC into anything like PayPal, I assume you are taking his comments out of context. Voohres would do better still if more people were interested in crypto in general - again a better scaling BTC would achieve this. Again this is all ad homenim, the message is scaling bitcoin on chain, the messenger is all the stuff about "turning btc into paypal" or providing exchanges being bad for some reason. 


No, there are many paths forward, he promotes one vision, core promote another. by your logic the only way to avoid division is to do exactly what the current dev team wants regardless of whether you believe it to be the right direction.


again this is wrong, they want to see bitcoin grow and don't believe the way forward promoted by core is the best possible way.

There will always be some portion of the network that uses centralised transactions - virtually every major service built on top of the btc network is somewhat centralised.


There will always be many users that don't run a node, even today there are only a few thousand nodes but estimates of up to a million holders. This will be the case with LN too. I don't see your point here. But we are currently limiting the number of transactions that happen on the network far more than we need to and as a result charging more than is required, this is bad for adoption.


I don't, you are making an assumption that doesn't exist. It's more that we should have enough capacity so that fees don't get too high. 


The PayPal quote is direct from Ver. There is a way to turn it into it - you make it so only big businesses run nodes, there are very few miners, then you end up with those entities getting heavily regulated, much like PayPal was. Ver directly said he found that risk acceptable, as long as it meant more adoption (e.g. making him rich).
Perhaps you can link to the quote. My guess is that it is taken somewhat out of context. Also, there would have to be an extreme change to not be able to run a node. Again you shouldn't think in these binary outcomes, the network just needs to scale with demand to keep fees low enough for adoption. At the moment even a basic computer with a half decent internet connection is sufficient to run a node, there would have to be an extreme change in volume in a short period of time for this to become sufficiently centralised. 


Again, this is too simplistic. The only way to be against division is to agree with everyone all the time. 


How? They want to increase the capacity of the network to further adoption. How is advocating growth against advocating growth? Disagreeing with core isn't being against growth.

You are linking two independent things here. Capacity has no effect on trustlessness.


Yes, it is semantics. As i said, value is driven by demand. I used number of people as a way of counting it, however if you want to change that to some other metric that is fine. but constraining the ability and (effectively) increasing the cost to use a product/service does not increase demand, no matter what metric you use.

You are clearly speculating. anyone who uses mycelium, coinbase etc for low value transactions is still doing better than the existing systems. 


No, I am saying exactly the same thing you are saying. Slow internet connections are dropped - which is perfectly fine, because if you are making low value transactions it is ok to rely on a third party node, if you are making high value transactions you can afford your own node. I don't think you know what a strawman argument is. 


This is an intentionally naive comment. you know already that the majority of btc payments are made through trusted nodes or off chain solutions. Talk about a strawman argument!!!


Do you even know what the pricing mechanism is for this?


you haven't provided any support for this - hence ad homenim. Attacking a person rather than the idea they state.

any day now...


There needs to be a certain number of nodes to ensure difficulty in changing the ledger but to assume everyone needs to validate the ledger consistently to conduct a transaction is insane.


It doesn't do this and you know it. At best it is around 1.7mb and that is with the assumption that everyone is using it. 4MB would be for a series of complex signatures which will never happen in reality. There is plenty of room for a genuine increase in capacity instead of this conditional increase if the code ever works and if it is adopted by the majority of the community. 


I could sink to name calling but what would be the point? would bitcoin be better because of it? Do you really think a significant portion of the community wants the capacity to increase because they are greedy or because they believe it is beneficial to the long term viability of the currency? You can dismiss it as greed if you are not willing to at least try and see it from the perspective of others.
@_date: 2016-08-26 20:31:38


It's not my hurry, it is the ever diminishing share of bitcoin in the crypto community.


The vast majority of transactions are made by people not using full nodes today. we are talking about marginal demand, which can still have much greater trust in a network that is distributed even if they are not running a full node. I know you already know this but are going to extremes to try and prove a point. 


Why do you think this is what will happen in reality? why will usage change? why would anyone use the network if the vast majority of use cases are priced out? It's more likely to stay roughly where it is at the moment unless there is an impetus for change.

This is the wrong assumption. Instead of assuming that any country should be able to run a node we should be going back to first principals. 
How many nodes do we need to make the network secure? For me It is somewhere between a few hundred and a thousand. If we have more nodes than that we are just being redundant. Then we can look at the speed of the top 1k nodes and work out the block size from the minimum speed of those nodes. The network shouldn't wait for you. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:17:59
The short answer is that Economics is a bastard science in that you cannot have a hard prediction of the future. The best you can do is evaluate the evidence and make predictions from there. How did Satoshi know there was a market for his product? He didn't but he believed there would be. This doesn't make the effects of economics any less real. Why do some markets grow and others die? It always comes down to supply and demand, but evaluating it in something as complicated as human decision making makes fools of almost everyone. 
Computer science can be evaluated, given input x we will get output y. 
A good question to ask is what do you (as in you not the royal you) do when you try to evaluate an investment? Let's say you decided BTC was a good investment, you made hundreds of assumptions by default that you could not scientifically prove or disprove. Would all countries ban BTC? would an individual country be so concerned that they created their own mining pool and overwhelmed the existing mining pools and 51% attacked (this would be super easy for the top 50 or so countries). Would other people really be interested in magic internet money and create an economy around it? Would someone else create a better cryptocurrency that usurps BTC? etc. 
For me, i have been following BTC for a few years now and am in the 1 million club, so i believe in the concept. However after reading a lot of information on both the economic side (for which my knowledge is significant, i have been managing investments for some time, have degrees, etc) and technical side (to the limit of my technical knowledge, which is at journeyman level) and what i see is an economy that is not growing as fast as it once was. Why would anyone want to start a new company while we are capacity constrained? It's insane to think that someone new  would want to start a new company in the BTC space when they have this enormous risk of how much a transaction will cost in the short to medium term. If SW and LN get of the ground it will be fantastic but until then we are in no-mans land. If i were looking to start a business in crypto land i would look for a currency that has more safety around transaction costs. 
From what i have read, BTC will not become significantly more centralised if capacity was increased a little in the short term to continue to have low cost transactions. It doesn't have to be a permanent increase, it just needs to be flexible enough to continue to build the economy while other solutions are sorted. None of us know when SW and LN will be widely adopted. Even if the code was released today how long would it be until there is enough adoption to allay the concerns of the next person who wants to build a btc business that relies on the network being open and cheap?

Today there are nodes with shitty internet connections that can't keep up with the network and they fall out of service. Why hasn't the network failed yet? because it is resilient to this issue.
If you trust the node of the wallet provider, exchange etc you are relatively safe - especially for small denominations which many of the marginal users will be. If you are large players they can afford enough resources to run your own node.
what don't you understand about this?


Thankyou, you have argued my point quite well generally. now you just need to apply this segwit cost concept to the network.

I think you have to ask yourself if it is in his own best interest to "destroy" bitcoin. What does he stand to gain by ruining his major store of value and the financial security he has achieved for himself and his family? Any rational thinker would come to the conclusion that this is not what he wants to do.
So then you would have to ask yourself why he is doing what he is doing if it is not for this nefarious purpose. I think he just has a different vision from what is being promoted by the core team and is working to make that a reality - like we all do with things we believe in. 
It is pretty clear that he thinks there needs to be an increase in on-chain scaling and he is working hard to build a coalition of people with the same goal to achieve that purpose. Looking at his motivations from this perspective you can see reason behind the disagreements he has with the core developers who have placed a lower priority on on-chain scaling.
We each have to do our own analysis of the bitcoin ecosystem and decide what we believe the most effective path forward is for it to flourish.

You are taking an absolute (verifying vs not verifying) and comparing it to a scalar (capacity/demand). Obviously no-one will increase the size of the blocks to the point where verification breaks down across the network - this should go without saying. There is plenty of room for marginal increases in capacity without the doomsday effect you are suggesting. right now capacity is being constrained because of this absurd fear that some marginal increase will blow up the network. It's hearsay and hyperbole. 


You are putting the cart before the horse. The marginal user doesn't care about validation costs and the beneficiaries of the increased demand will be willing to pay the increased cost as the value of the network (and their investment) increases.

I said there will be marginal impacts, your were stating validating vs not validating.


Not at all, the limit hasn't grown in years while network capacity has. If we could support the current limit on the old network we can support a larger limit on the new limit.

It ads noting to the thought process except that some person who read some stuff thinks something. do you know the background of these well read people? are they programmers, economists, garbage men, basement dwellers? You need to come up with your own reasoning as to why you think this is the way to go.
The reason I want some short term growth in block size is because i don't want any hindrance for people looking to invest in or contribute to the bitcoin ecosystem. There are many competing versions of block chain tech emerging and the one that wins will have the greatest critical mass. we could well lose our primary position if we are not inclusive enough.
Additionally i have seen no compelling argument as to why a small increase in the block size limit in the short term will affect the security of the network. Until this is shown we are potentially hindering growth for no gain in security.
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:45:52
It's just a rhetorical device to try and highlight that the 1Mb cap is somewhat arbitrary in terms of capacity/security. If we had 1Gb block sizes then obviously we would end up with a terribly centralised network that has costs of running a node far outside what average people could afford, but we would have huge capacity for cheap transactions. If we had 10Kb block sizes then everyone could run a node on a TI83, but there would not be enough room to get a sufficient number of transactions to make an economic community.
Looking at the front page over the past 6 months (from my anecdotal perspective only) we have seen fewer (not 0 but fewer) new businesses starting up in btc, many of the brokerages and exchanges expanding into alts, some alts gaining a bit of traction, growth in VC investment moderating. Some of these things should happen naturally as businesses become established in the industry but it can also show that there are fewer entrepreneurs and investors willing to take the leap and invest in Bitcoin based industries. From my perspective it is because we are sending a signal that bitcoin is not open for business and we cannot guarantee cheap transactions on which to base your business. 
If there were moderate increases in capacity while people are working on SegWit, LN and other methods to increase capacity then anyone looking to start a business would know that there is a willingness to scale with them as transaction demand increases. This could also be done in a way that centralisation does not become sufficiently bad that there is any real chance in being able to regulate all the nodes (that is why i think the PayPal comparison is a little silly). If and when these higher layer networks and capacity expansions come on board we could always decrease the blocksize again if desirable. The cost of running nodes is becoming cheaper all the time as hardware costs decrease and internet speeds increase, so there should be a naturally available capacity increase over time anyway. If we had moderate increases now then we would be back to an equivalent level of network usage in a few years anyway.
The other concern is the network effect of currency. Every conversion between currencies has a cost associated with it so it is likely that there will only be a handful of cryptocurrencies in the medium term as people build around the most useful versions. Bitcoin is obviously winning the race to become one of these currencies at the moment but if we take too long to scale or if we continue to make the currency seem less attractive because of high fees then we leave the door open to competitors.

There are many different philosophies and economic theories relating to want bitcoin could become. To state this to an absolute is to assume to know the ultimate outcome of what is the early days of an economic experiment. 
There is no way anyone can say with absolute certainty that the best way forward does not include at least some on chain scaling. 
Personally I would like to see the block size increase in the short term until we have tested off chain solutions readily available. Thus not limiting growth in the short term. Once SW and LN are actually implemented we could re-evaluate the situation.

I have a lot of doubt believing anyone on this topic until we have had at least one significant recession. I also think the effects may vary depending on what kind of recession we have.
If we have another housing crash moving to liquidity crisis then we could see bitcoin dropping as us newly wealthy bitcoin holders buy up cheap houses and stocks. A lot of investors here got into bitcoin specifically because they couldn't afford to buy a house and had to look for something else. 
If we have an inflation driven recession then bitcoin could skyrocket as fiat currencies drop in value quickly and people look for a better store of value. 
If the shift to automation leads to increased unemployment and a reduction in disposable income/tax revenue then we could see stocks/government debt get downgraded - pushing investors into bitcoin as a safe haven.
Also, because bitcoin can't just print more money or be taken as tax then we could also see liquidity problems during demand spikes around a recession. Hodlers hold on even more due to price rises and fear of losing fiat currency while new buyers move in to escape fiat.
Any of the above could lead to global government crackdowns on exchanges and other cryptocurrency on-ramps which could dry up demand. 
Anyone who thinks they know which of the above scenarios or any other scenarios this redditor is too dumb to figure out is probably making stuff up.

The bitcoin &lt;&gt; fiat relationship is a little simple. We cannot exclude goods and services from the equation. should banks refuse to trade fiat for bitcoin but individuals are prepared to accept it for their labours then bitcoin can continue to flourish. E.g. say a builder accepts bitcoin for his work because he knows he can pay his contractors in the same currency then bitcoin will have a value in terms of labour rather than in terms of fiat and at no time is a bank required to be an intermediary. It would obviously be easier if banks accepted bitcoin but it does not guarantee its demise if they don't. I believe this transition has occurred in countries with excessive inflation where people just start accepting USD and reducing their reliance on the weak currency, however I am too lazy to find a reference so feel free to ignore this part.

I'm assuming bitcoin has achieved according to our wildest hopes and is now the default currency.
There is always a problem when people are unsure about the counter party. A good example is [Akerlof's Lemons]( When trust is lost credit markets freeze. Another example is the 2008 financial crisis, no-one knew for certain which banks were holding all the bad debt and therefore were unwilling to lend to anyone. Bitcoin, in it's current form, cannot solve information asymmetry problems around the creditworthiness of counter parties. 
The thing that greased the wheels of the financial system in 08 was the Reserve Bank being the lender of last resort. It was willing to lend to financial institutions when it was uncertain of the result when no-one else was. The main reasons for this are that they could create money and had the taxpayer backing them. In a bitcoin economy neither of these will be likely.
TL:DR Rational mathematical rules may not work too well with irrational people. However we will not know for certain until that situation arises.

Saving is only good if those funds are circulated back through the economy. When those saved coins aren't either lent or invested they are reducing the money supply and slowing the economy. when people get scared they do not lend or invest, and that is the crux of why any recession occurs. If the flow of funds freezes there can be wild distortions in the "fair value" of goods and services. These distortions are not rational, if there are very few lenders and someone needs money to eat they will sell almost anything they own for an amount that is not fair outside of crisis situations. A situation will be created where the wealthy have disproportionate power.
There is a cost to intervening in a free market, however there can be a far greater cost from not intervening, in fact markets need to be controlled from excess. [Here]( and [Here]( are two lists of market failure where intervention is preferable to return the market to normal operating conditions.
Nice ratios around population growth and supply may seem rational and plausible when the economy is humming along smoothly but they don't mean squat when something comes along and shatters an assumption the market was relying on. There are almost an infinite number of examples of this irrational behaviour in markets, from the Swiss franc moving 20% overnight, to the liquidity freeze in 08, the demise of LCTM in the 90's which created counter party risk, all the way back to the tulip bubble when people convinced themselves that tulips were worth a fortune until they had a collective rational thought and the price dropped precipitously. 
To think that we will not be this stupid again is naive. We are greedy in the good times and scarred in the bad times. When we run up against the hard rules of bitcoin (and it is responsible for a significant portion of economic activity) there will likely be a liquidity crisis or depression as severe as any we have seen and no lender of last resort to step in and bail us out.

If you were an investor who saw this risk of expensive or delayed transactions would you be investing in this space? Some will see it as temporary, others will look somewhere else.
As long as we actually meet the expected growth targets there probably won't be a problem but every day we delay we are leaving the door ajar for others to enter the market.

I am not purposefully missing the point, I have treated your comments with respect and advocated mine. We disagree on what is more important in the short term. To claim that i am being disingenious is part of the problem here, when i am advocating my position i am called a liar.
You haven't provided any scientific proof that slightly larger blocks will cause any lasting damage yet vhemently stick to the position that they can't change. Why don't you provide this science? where is it? Why do i have to accept your blocksize argument without scientific proof and you get to ignore mine for the same reason.
I have provided econmic arguments that the eintire global investment industry uses to assess investment and it works pretty well for the capitalist system. Bitcoin is not only a Computer Science experiment it is an experiment in economics, trade, legal agreements, regulation and potentially politics.  Everything except the computer science component is being ignored in the short term. 
As a more general question (if we ignore the blocksize issue for now) what do you see bitcoin becoming? Do you want it to replace fiat money in international trade entirely? Do you want it to be a store of wealth only? Do you want it to become a large enough system that it can do both?
I understand you position but will continue to advocate mine in the hopes of providing a broader perspective to a community whos knowledge base is heavily focused on computer science but less so in other areas that are just as important to bitcoins prosperity.

That's the thing with the security arguement, this can be tested but there has been no compelling evidence that this is the case. The average block size has grown from ~0.5Mb to almost 1Mb over the past year but the number of nodes has stayed stable. So there doesn't seem to be a security issue on that front.
Core is advocating a hard fork later in their pipeline, so that doesn't seem to be an unnescessary risk either. I just haven't seen anything that suggests that the network would collapse with a SMALL one off increase in the block size that gives the network the required capacity until the other scaling features are ready.


Again, we all need to make estimates for future use and plan accordingly. None of us have a crystal ball but as i stated before there are some compelling facts that show that more people would be using the network if there was more capacity. 
Hopefully if we take this arguement and apply it to any other business the real opportunity cost will become clear. Let's assume Apple put a hard limit of 1m Iphones to be produced each year. Their company would be virtually worthless, they would have no app developers because the market would be too small, they would have fewer internal developers because they wouldn't have the revenue to pay them. Itunes would not exist because they wouldn't have the market power to negotiate with the music industry, Apple pay wouldn't exist because they wouldn't have the size to negotiate with VISA. etc. 
Saying MIGHT is technically true because we can't predict the future but there is a real cost of hindering growth. Bitcon's product is secure transactions, limiting transactions limits utility and the value of the network. This is why core has a scaling roadmap (which i like btw, i just prioritise growth while their roadmap is being built).


I don't see this as a fundamental change, Satoshi only put in a 1mb limit as an arbitrary figure to stop spam and acknowledged that it was expected to change over time. 
Also, once core's roadmap is finalised there is no reason we can't just drop the blocksize limit back down if everyone agrees it is for the best, however we don't run the risk of stifiling growth until this happens. 


I have heard of this too, but could you imagine anyone being interested in a network with 1-2 transactions per second with an undefined period before scaling occurs? who would risk investing to build a business on top of that?

These are not random economic concepts, there is a noted effect (substitution) related to demand for a service based on price (the crux of the issue) this stems from consumer theory (which was referenced in the original article). I then linked to another article that has several research papers referenced in the calculation of indifference curves which apply consumer theory to assess when the substitution effect takes hold. This had several external references to economic papers and data further supporting the argument. 
This is already a cogent argument, however some people may not be open to being convinced no matter how much evidence is supplied. I have presented my case, feel free to disagree.

There are several testnet cases where a 2Mb blocksize is fine. What exactly do you think will happen if the blocksize increased to 2Mb? 
Explain where my circular logic is? I don't think you will find any.
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:33:27


The cost to run the network is in BTC (assuming only those that hold BTC run nodes, which i think you can agree is a fair assumption). BTC has increased much more than nodes have decreased. In fact i went on a little research mission to see what the impact of larger blocks may be on the number of nodes. The results are as follows:
The average block size (i.e. marginal cost of hosting a node) has increased [50% to 60%]( in the past year. the number of nodes has decreased somewhere between [3% to 8%]( in the past year. This shows a correlation of ~0.1, which is weak. That implies that if the average block size went to 2Mb (which wouldn't happen in the short term) we should see somewhere between 9% to 24% reduction in the number of nodes (assuming a linear correlation). We currently have around 5800 nodes, do you think the network would be much less secure with 3000 nodes at worst? In reality the drop will not be that much because there is no way all the blocks will be full all the time. It is also likely that the value of the network would continue to increase becuase it now has more utility.
Also, the marginal cost increase does not nearly represent the total cost increase to node owners because the sunk and fixed costs don't change. I am presenting a worst case scenario.
In the same time the Bitcoin market cap has increased from [$3.5b to $9b]( Any hodlers of bitcoin have made over 150% profit - not bad for a (worst case) 50% - 60% increase in costs.
If you can find longer term data i am happy to look at it, however we should remember that noise increases as sample size decreases.


scaling is an economic argument because of the network effect, as described earlier. Can you describe in detail how the math does not work, i have never heard a compelling argument as to why this is the case (and i read a lot about bitcoin).


One of the good things about knowing economics is that we have reems of data to show that people are not perfectly rational (look up behavioural economics if you are not familiar with it). However i also believe people should not be mislead about the facts, and there is no evidence that a small blocksize increase in the short term will destroy the network (feel free to prove me wrong). Again this is where your antagonistic style comes into play, when a side you disagree with proffers their opinion they are being "pushed or coerced", however when they are listening to you it is their self interest. I am happy for us to disagree, but the above results imply that there is a strong economic interest for us to increase capacity.


There is demand from transaction creaters and full node users, however these are not equal. Transaction creaters create demand for bitcoin as a financial utility and given that there is a "relatively" fixed supply of bitcoin available this additonal demand should result in an increased price for the BTC network which benefits all of us as early adopters and is shown above to outweigh increased costs - a net profit for node operators. The demand from full node users relates to security only, and given my above results any rational node operator should prefer the economic benefit over the very marginal reduction in security (is it that much easier to hack 3000 nodes instead of 6000 nodes? i suspect not).
@_date: 2016-06-10 04:44:52


possibly the marginal node may stop, but if the network has greater economic value it is more likely that new nodes will start up as more people start using bitcoin - just as has always been the case. The network started with one node and no value, now it has thousands of nodes and billions in value.


What were you callying a straw man if not in relation to the scaling argument? I was assuming it was in relation to the roadmap? Perhaps i can ignore your straw man statement entirely if you can't even state the false argument.


this is a poor argument, we are here to advocate our positions, not "decide for othe people". Decentralisation is not zero sum, there may be a negative correlation between chain size and decentralisation (can you provide references theories, just like you asked of me?). Either way a small increase in chain size the short term is not going to kill decentralisation, in fact if you assome Moore's law to be true then we will have the same level of decentralisation in 18 months with 2mb blocs as we have now. The bigger short term concern is capacity. and as said above, a network with a greater economic value is likely to encourage more nodes.

What were your concerns about the creation of ? I might have missed something. It splits the community over an issue but there was nowhere else to discuss blocksize concerns. r/Bitcoin censures a lot of discussion around blocksize which makes me wary around the intentions of the moderators - this is a genuine issue that many in the community care deeply about and it is (generally) no longer open for discussion on one of the major forums. Deeming bitcoin with a larger blocksize as an altcoin seems extreme to me.
More concerns have arisen over the current snafu with Etherium - prior to this all altcoin discussion was moderated out of but negative news is suddenly acceptable when it can be used as an argument against change? Additionally all the payment delay issues (negative news for small blocksize)were consolidated into a megathread which has the impact of minimising how many people are affected/confused by the effects of a blocksize limit. Why aren't all the price movement threads consolidated into a megathread - they are just as spammy as the delay issues.
The mods could genuinely believe these issues are reasonable but to me it seems there is a non zero chance that these decisions have been made to push an agenda.
I usually look up a reddit multi thread with and combined because I want to know all sides of the discussion as it is the only way i can get a real perspective on the community. has its own issues with trolls, whiners and limits on posting times for some of the more vociferous small block advocates but has me concerned too.

If the comments on the other thread are true then the Chinese government is looking to establish [capital controls]( to stop lots of people moving their money out of China. This usually occurs when a country has a fixed exchange rate and is an issue that arises due to the [impossible trinity]( China has a fixed exchange rate and sets its own monetary policy. It seems that more people think that china's economy is going to weaken than strengthen so they are looking to move their money out out China before it get's devalued. 
If capital controls are put in place people then look for any way possibly to get their money out of the country now that official channels are closed. [This]( article shows that capital outflows from China have been in the hundreds of billions over the past couple of years. Normally these funds would go through the banks but now alternative channels would need to be found. Obviously the Chinese government can stop most of these funds leaving the country but people being people will always try to skirt the laws. 
Trading volume in BTC was about [$250m]( in the last 24 hours (up from about $60m a short time ago). so you can see that only a tiny amount of the desired capital outflow from China would need to be diverted to Bitcoin to have a pretty hefty effect on volumes. Generally speaking not all people who buy bitcoin in CNY would turn around and sell it immediately so we could see aggregate demand for bitcoin increasing which should push up the price until enough HODLers decide the price is high enough to sell. 
Obviously this all relies on the Chinese government not shutting down their domestic bitcoin exchanges and capital controls actually being put in place. 
Western markets don't have this problem because they have floating exchange rates, if people want to move capital from one country to another the exchange rate moves to lower the value of the original market v the foreign market until the original market's economy is seen to show the same return as the foreign market.

There are many examples where this falls over. [Here]( is a list of some of the common ones.

I think you are giving a false weight to the non-fork side. If we want reasonable on-chain growth we need a hard fork. The concern about two chains can be mitigated with commitments from the major mining pools, wallets, exchanges, etc. 
We can have a very solid idea of how much of the network will move with the HF. once there is a significant majority then any remainders will have to come on board as they will never be able to outmine the current difficulty level.
The concerns raised by the small blockers are only there because it is in their economic self interest to keep the blocks small.

This is a silly sentence, obviously people can do what the want. I am advocating what i think is best for the network and so are you. You can't logically think that me advocating my position is forcing others to do anything while you advocating yours is 'letting people do what they want'. 


You just described the negative correlation in the second part of this paragraph while denying it in the first then threw in a straw man for fun. Implying you don't know what either of those terms are. This paragraph is self contradictory and can be ignored.


Yes but as we have already discussed, there are significant reasons to imply that we are missing out on demand now. we are missing out on economic value when you already seem to think the network can handle 2mb blocks. so waiting creates a loss of value for nothing.


we discussed the demand issue earlier in this chain. Don't start it again unless you want to refute my earlier statements.

That's one of the problems around here. BTC is a good system and has currently earned its position at the top of the digital currency table, however this sort of hubris and complacency is asking for trouble. ETH already have well over $1b market cap and while i acknowledge that is smaller than BTC it is a much larger percentage than it was a year ago. If ETH offers more utility there is no reason it can't supercede BTC.
A fixed limit has advantages and drawbacks. Gold has held its value over millenia however all major civilisations have grown on an inflation based currency system. The romans debased their gold coinage, the west prints money. There is no reason that ETH couldn't grow to be an effective currency for the same reason. Bitcoin will eventually become deflationary once the number of coins being lost &gt; number being created, do you know of any effective civilisation that has worked on such a system? This is an experiment.

Given the time until the halving it wouldn't be possible implement beforehand. but ideally it would have been better to have this in place before it occurred as there is the potential for confirmation times to slow if any miners drop out.

But this is backwards thinking. Can you provide me any proof of anything that that is an opportunity cost? 
Could you provide proof that google would become as big as it did before it did. could you provide proof that all the banks were overvalued in 2007? obviously not.
There are metrics we can use to infer demand for digital currency, primarialy how full are the blocks? are transaction fees going up? are substitutes rising?
we know blocks are full, we know transaction fees are going up and we know ETH is closer to becoming a competitor than it was. All these things are marginal at the moment but they will become more of an issue the longer we have to wait for a scaling solution.

It was a result based in a theory that was referenced to many independent studies and experiments. This is the exact process of the scientific method. But you can call it random if you like.
Additionally, in your comment [here]( you state the following regarding the link between prices and demand


So it seems that you already (at least partially) agree that price increase for a service will reduce demand.
Now you could still argue that there are no available substitutes, but as long as you are willing to accept that a financial system exists and at least some people shop around for the cheapest deal there is no way to avoid the conclusion that the network needs to scale with demand or people will go elsewhere. 
This is the argument I have made.

Me too. just to give ourselves enough time to get other scaling features organised. Don't want to be leaving anything on the table for competitors to catch.
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:55:46
And we have arrived at the "core" of the problem. Regardless of what we say you can't prove opportunity cost like a math problem. Sadly it doesn't make it any less real and we all lose out on growth because of it. We could be having the same arguement if the blocks size was 0.5Mb. The cost to those looking at the network from an economic perspective think it is all too obvious.
You claim security will be risked but that is always the case with anything we do, there is huge risk in introducing the amount of new code related to SW but everyone seems to think that is ok.
Let me ask you this, the block size can be software limited below 1Mb but noone does it, why would everyone be at 1Mb if there wasn't demand for capacity? surely the network would be safer with 0.5Mb blocks?

The problem doesn't solve itself. If you have 100 people filling up the capacity of the local road then when an expressway is built 1000 people start using that and the local road is forgotten.
It will be great if they get Bitcoin to scale, but we remain in limbo hoping that noone else manages to complete their expressway in the meantime.

@_date: 2016-06-12 15:16:51


No it is a cost, a certain expense per month. Every business on earth makes this decision. More work and more expense is perfectly fine if the reward exceeds it.


My argument is that the average block size represents a causal relationship to the cost on a node operator going up, which is clearly the case since each transaction must have some non-zero marginal cost. It's a broader argument of cause and effect, not a specific correlation to what we have seen in the local period of recent history.
So you are saying that innovation has compensated for block size increases. What makes you think this will stop? We have either Xthin or compact blocks around the corner which should drastically reduce node cost. There is a real loss to the bitcoin now due to transaction constraints. 


Everyone agrees that the computer science way to describe the Blockchain on-chain scaling is O(n2). This means that a high n value will not just have a high cost, it will have an exponentially high cost. This is because every full node that joins the Blockchain network incurs a cost on every other full node already in the network: they all have to validate and sync and store all the transactions of every new guy. Imagine a chat room in which everyone has to read the messages of the other people in order to respond. In the beginning it would be OK, but after a while that chat room would be so noisy it would take a huge effort to keep up.
I will grant you that scaling on-chain would be great, how simple and easy and nice our system is now is amazing. But because of this potentially huge cost that could potentially grow so large that it wouldn't be mathematically possible to keep up with, we need to make sure that looking ahead we aren't hitting these problems. And these issues are not all that far off. In July of last year, many block explorers were knocked offline because they couldn't process the large transactions that F2Pool created to clean up a dust spam attack on the network. Gavin Andresen had to put in 2 special other limits in his 2mb patch, just to prevent even more potential denial of service attacks that could knock nodes offline or keep them CPU grinding for minutes or hours. Miners themselves are reluctant to increase the size of the blocks they make, due to their desire for caution: remember they already have a super fast relay network that already is faster than compact blocks would be, and even given that they themselves have stated that they don't want to increase beyond a few megabytes for fear of network disruption.
The exponential cost would have to be extreem for a small blocksize increase in the short term especially seeing how well the recent average block size increase has been accepted. I doubt any of the above is economically relevant unless blocks get well above 2Mb.


then you should push for it now because we need it now. SW is vapourware until it is installed by the majority of the network. There is a real economic cost to holding back capacity.


Again this is not a game of absolutes, there may be some people who drop out but we haven't seen that over the past year. Again it is doubtful that a small blocksize increase would have much of an impact and we shouldn't extrapolate out too far. This is only covering the short term until alternatives are implimented. 


I was using a shortcut in language. but you didn't answer the question, do you really see much of a decrease in safety if nodes drop for 6k to 3k? i doub't it.
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:13:41

@_date: 2016-06-10 17:51:32


This goes against core's roadmap for compact blocks, as we have seen today there is already a 50x increase in the size of the blocks that can be mined for the same network cost (the limiting factor for miners). Once this is installed we should be able to go to a block size 50x the current size (not that i am advicating it, i would be happy with 1,5mb blocks until core gets its upgrades finished) 


You still have no idea what a straw man is, please stop using that term. 
Re: hard forks. wouldn't the best time to test a hard fork be a small block size increase now, this has the absolute least impact on code change and it can be done now which should be easier than when more people need to upgrade their code assuming bitcoin becomes more prominent.


Nearly all of us see payment channels as being useful. All we need is slightly bigger blocks to cover the demand issue until these are rolled out. we can reevaluate in the future as needs warrant.

This is a known logical fallacy as a slippery slope is basically extrapolating one event out into the future ([relevant xkcd]( Using the same argument you shouldn't be able to have a beer because you will become a heroin addict - silly when put into that context.
I don't need to prove you wrong on a logical fallacy as it is just that - a fallacy. It's the equivalent of me asking you to prove to me that i won't become a heroin addict if i drink a beer. It's not throwing horseshit around, it is highlighting a fundamental flaw in your argument.
The blocksize should be considered at any given time just as any other changes to the protocol are considered. We should weigh network capacity against growth and decide whether it is in our best interest to increase it. As for 4Mb or 8Mb - why wouldn't you want that if the network can handle it? It's just another variable that should be measured, tested and considered. We all want bitcoin to succeed and to do that we need to make it as appealing to as many people as possible. The cheaper and faster we can make transactions the more likely it is that more people will use it.

The definition he uses seems to relate to (PDF warning) [this]( lecture by John Nash. 
It does raise an interesting concept - would a non-inflationary currency force fiat currencies to reduce inflation.  I guess we will find out if the bitcoin experiment succeeds.

That's a pretty good way of looking at it. If the Core devs want to keep a network small and use it as a settlement layer while others are happy to increase the throughput and make their chain more focused on everyday commerce then there is not really a problem.
In my opinion, it will be the network that offers the best value for customers to transact that will end up holding the most value. At this stage it seem that Bitcoin Cash is likely to be the winner as it allows for cheaper and more reliable timing of transactions. If Lightning turns out to offer an amazing service then that could also be implemented on BCH and using the BCH settlement layer will still be cheaper. 
Unless the doomsday comments are true and blocksizes increase to a point where the network is too centralised, I can't see a way that BTC will ever offer better utility and service to the end user. And that's all that matters at the end of the day.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:19:14

I'm happy with your response, first time with no straw man arguements, no random antoginism. I'm starting to think we could be friends.


I will leave the very technical situations up to the people more focused on the Comp Sci fields. I am more focused on the economics side but am a journeyman in comp sci so i know enough to challenge something that doesn't objectively make sense. For interest, could you elaborate on this point.


And if we prove that it's easy to marginalize and shut out significant dissent, what does that mean for you the next time you end up on the dissenting side?
Potentially we do not need a hard fork, but it seems likely. From what i have read SegWit would work better from a HF too. If that's the case then i think we should try the simplest case first - possibly a blocksize increase to ( say) 1.2Mb so we can see how hard it is to get everyone to agree. I seriously doubt a block size increase from 1 to 1.2Mb would be controversial because the average block size hase already increased by more than 200Kb this year with little detriment. This would leave the door open to introduce more complex/controversial upgrades via HF.
No dissenting opinion will ever be accepted, however i am working hard to try and convince the majority that a small blocksize increase is in all of our best economic interest - then it won't be a dissenting opinion. Also, it is very difficult to see what is the dissenting opinion as a small number of miners controll the upgrade process and a lot of people just don't care about the details.


It would deliever a capacity increase assuming everone upgraded, but it is vapourware until it isn't. A small HF in the short term isn't vapourware. There is no guarantee that everyone will upgrade to SW in the short term either, but a HF is difinitive (although it does carry risks and should be well broadcast before being implemented).


Thanks for the explaination. I understand where you are coming from. Personally i think we should be pushing for enough capacity to keep the network growing as i really want to avoid a position where ETH or another digital currency takes our spot. I think it is worth the risk to HF if the miners and major wallet providers are on board because we will all do better if we make the network more economically valuable. 
Also, from what i understand a node cost ~US$10 per month to run. We could quite easily build a contingency fund of (say) 1000 nodes x US$10/month * 6 months = $US60k or 100Btc to run nodes during the changeover to keep the project decentralised. There are several thousand people over at that would be happy to contribute and i assume quite a few ers would be happy to help too.

@_date: 2016-06-09 11:40:49
Excellent, now we are getting somewhere. We agree the network needs to scale with demand. 
A Straw Man argument fallacy is not appropriate here as I have not created an argument that core's scaling roadmap is anything other than what it is. I like all the upgrades they are working on, however I do think that there are risks around the timeline for implementation (both in the advertised times and being able to accurately meet those times) when compared to demand and the implications this can have by creating room in the market that can be met by competitors. No-one can guarantee exactly when these implementations will occur.
There are three strong indicators that there is currently more demand for a blockchain transaction services than supply on the bitcoin network: Increasingly full blocks, the steady increase in transaction fees, and a gradual increase in the value and transaction volume of a substitute (the ETH network). This implies that there is unmet demand in the market for blockchain/cryptocurrency financial transactions. It's obviously hard to get measurements and data for this demand because we can only see what has been done on the blockchain, not what would have been done if there was more capacity on the network. But what we do know is that any supply issues would have been mitigated in the time between now and when this extra capacity comes online (assuming core can reach their targets) if there had been a one off increase in the block size in the interim.
What if it takes too long for supply to catch up with demand? Well people will go to competitors (as we have agreed). If it takes much longer then these competitors will have time to make their product good enough and large enough that users will have no reason to switch back to the bitcoin network when it finally does have the required capacity - see the [network effect]( Bitcion falls almost perfectly within the first three industries mentioned where network effects are applicable. Our competition are not there yet but we are not as far out in front as we used to be. Again, they wouldn't have this opportunity if there was not concern about supply being able to keep up with demand in the bitcoin network.
We are unnecessarily taking a risk that could have been relatively easily avoided.

Australia is just statistical noise from a small sample set.
@_date: 2016-11-14 15:16:05
This argument is always a bit of a cop out. People are looking at building L2 solution (LN) with no way of testing the economic impact to the system yet discriminate against continuing what has already been done - allowing the average blocksize to grow (from 0Kb in 2008 to 1Mb recently). 
Neither version will be tested economically before it is released in the wild because they just can't be. How do we know what the impact will be of a L2 solution? will all transactions move there? will enough transactions move there that miner fees dry up and therefore decrease total mining security? will more people be willing to host nodes when the settlement layer becomes further removed from the currency? 
I have no answers to the above questions, but it does seem strange that the community has split into two groups - both so confident in what is better and having their ideas reinforced by their respective discussion groups.

It really does feel like the difference between (e.g.) Fox and CNN. Both sides believe they are correct, both have armed themselves with talking points to support their outlook, and both sides are convinced the other is either stupid or actively working against the best interests of bitcoin. 
I completely agree with you that there is no natural correction process where people can find a middle ground and that has given additional support to people who hold extreme views. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:20:30
I hear what you are saying and agree that there are certainly many scenarios where the opportunity to reverse transactions is beneficial. And I agree that LN could well be an amazing development. But there is no connection between the size/throughput of blocks on the bitcoin chain and usefulness of LN. LN would work just as well on a chain with 1mb blocks as it would on one with 10mb blocks. 
I don't know what the optimal number of transactions is to maximise the size of the bitcoin network is while still having the security, privacy and decentralised benefits inherent in blockchain tech. But this is what the argument is about - Maximising demand for the coin so that it draws investment and value (which is an incredibly important driver of security) against maximising the security of the network through decentralisation and privacy. However it seems that the optimal point is having greater than 1mb blocks - something that limits the utility of the network by a greater extent than it increases security. I am not advocating unlimited size, and as stated above, i agree that there are many scenarios where bitcoin doesn't work in the most favourable way for consumers - but there is an optimal tradeoff somewhere where the cost and time to settle transactions is small enough to be useful yet not so 
The chain that maximises the utility and price of suitable blockchain payments is the one that will gain the most in value because there is more demand for the coin.

I like the chutzpah around this and admire anyone who puts themselves out there to start a business insurance is one of the industries where scale is a huge advantage in the dilution of risk.
Each agreement is limited to a relatively small number of people resulting in much greater variation in potential costs per policy. You almost need a reinsurance market from the getgo otherwise one of the main benefits of insurance - reduced pricing  based on statistical probability - is foregone. How do you (or your proxy expert) know what the true risk of the insurance is unless you (or they) have years of experience with the thing being insured and any other associated variables? Even for just insuring a car you need to know the probability that the insuree is likely to have an accident, the relative expense of the vehicle to repair, the general risks of the vehicle being stolen in the place the insuree lives, the propensity of natural disasters in the area, etc. You would need half a dozen expert proxies to get close to what professional assessors can do with their reams of data. What happens if your pool just has statistically bad luck and, say, 5 out of 10 people have accidents at a similar time - you are then on the hook for paying for half a car just as an insurance policy. 
How is the contract enforced? Do you have to sue each individual person if they reneg? Do you know their details? Are the agreements legally binding? There are untold tomes of work defining exactly what the causes of an accident/event is and whether it is covered as part of the policy. 
What stops someone just starting a new account if they act like a jerk in one pool and want to start with a fresh reputation? Until the reputation is well established you need to be much more conservative in offering insurance because the risk is so centralised in a little group - making the offer prohibitively expensive to start with. One bad apple turns a cheap insurance policy into an expensive one.
There is a suggestion that you only sign up to a team with friends in it which is very likely to cause arguments when it comes time to determine the costs of the payout. You could lose friends as well as your vehicle.
Can you invest the float or does the btc sit in the account until needed? Earnings on the float is one of the main ways to reduce insurance premiums as the profit can be used to cover the costs of any payout in terms of premium paid. Would you need an expert investor as well as risk assessor in the pool? Do you hedge the currency risk? What happens if btc is having one of it's crazy weeks right when you need a payout?

He eventually gets around to saying something (at least from the position he is advocating in his book).

There's nothing wrong with this at all. She goes a bit hard on the metaphors but it is good that perspective is being provided on all sides. 
We are in uncharted territory with a currency that can't be inflated or debased. Who knows where that will lead. Anyone certain of the impacts of this are either stupid or pushing an agenda. 
I am hopeful bitcoin will succeed at a global scale, however that is not yet certain. We haven't been through economic cycles with bitcoin as a major currency and don't know what the macro impact would be when people get scared and hoard BTC in a financial crisis. There is no release valve for governments to step in and spend up big or provided liquidity in a crisis because they can't create more BTC or tax it effectively. We could see a huge decrease in liquidity and the financial markets grind to a halt with massive asset price declines. A worst case example would be that anyone who was holding BTC at the start of a financial crisis could just wait until other asset prices plummet and then swoop in and buy huge amounts of real world assets - in effect consolidating huge amounts of power amongst a few early adopters of crypto-currency holders.

I suppose, although i'm not really a big fan of the fee market on bitcoin at this stage, would prefer a small blocksize increase to tide us over until LN, SW are up and running. High fees mean we are leaving network size on the table.
@_date: 2016-05-30 19:19:18
I watched the video. It sounds like Xthin blocks would help as Patrick states that the time it takes to switch blocks is the sum of the time to download, verify and forward to everyone else. If Xthin blocks reduces the amount of data that needs to be downloaded then it is very relevant to these statistics.

@_date: 2016-05-17 09:17:51
It will take time for the network to adjust so instead of mining a block every ~10 minutes it will occur roughly every 12 minutes. Same difficulty, less hashing power. That means instead of having 6Mb of blockchain every hour we will only have 5Mb blockchain space every hour, or 5/6 the current space every 10 minutes.

Slippery slope is a terrible argument and should be ignored. we are in a race to build a new network. Any additional fees or latency in the settlement process only provides a window for competitors to enter. Just because it not running at capacity all the time does not mean there shouldn't be more capacity now, especially with the halving coming up soon. Devs should also think like economists otherwise they run the real risk of leaving room for competitors.
the last paragraph is terrible. What is a lower level? there is no bashing, it is a difference of opinion. Intransigence is death.
@_date: 2016-05-17 10:00:45
True, or there may be a large fee increase if capacity drops too much which would also encourage miners back into to work.
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:42:36
This is a combination of code and economic systems. Both must work in tandem. If capacity becomes an issue then a HF is worth it. Thinking of code only is too simplistic.

of course the size of the market has a correlation to the liquidity of the asset. It is only an issue if you expect a startup technology to act like an established industry that has decades to create trust and historical data. if this is an issue now then bitcoinwanderer had no idea what he was getting into and neither do you. neither of you have given the slightest consideration to how markets work.
in addition, market liquidity shouldn't be compared by dollar figures when the markets are different sizes. using your example above, $10k in bitcoins is a much bigger percentage of the market than $10k in AAPL stock. this comparison therefore has no capicity to measure how liquid a market is.
so I reiterate that the comparison between AAPL and bitcoin is a heap of shit. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:58:39
what was bitcoins total value at the start of the year? ~13 million. given the latest price of $500 per bitcoin we have a new simple average of 2.5b.  Take any sort of weighted average and the bitcoin ratio would easily surpass the 250% mentioned above. Give it a few hours and we may well reach that ratio on a simple average basis.
so liquidity looks pretty good for little old bitcoin if compared to AAPL.
of course bitcoin doesn't equal the NASDAQ or NYSE. it is a start-up company. honestly what kind of utterly useless comparison is that? it's like saying Tesla is a rounding error compared to the value of all car stocks. its completely true but it doesn't mean anything. this is a brand new asset class, how could it not be extremely volatile as it grows.
you are not making any real arguments. many assets have concentrated ownership, many are volatile. Both points are especially true in a start-up phase. 2 people owned 100% of Google at one stage, and at that time it was certainly less liquid than bitcoin.
find a flaw in the macroeconomics or the technology before you cast a decision.
your comments are just so utterly useless I don't know what else to say.

go read a book. liquidity is only relevant to market size. if you try to move a greater portion of the market with the same dollar value because the market value is smaller you would expect it to cause a larger disruption. the 10k figure is only relevant to you, not the market.
don't straw man the bitcoin community, one of the fundamental tenants floating around here is don't invest more than you are prepared to lose. Many expect significant growth over the long term but we all realise that regulatory or technology events could push the bitcoin price to zero. If you think something is set in stone perhaps you could show it to us.

Aussie here too. just bought first coins a few minutes ago.
signed up to MtGox on the weekend with an account that is in line to be verified. that doesn't stop you from purchasing coins. I did a overseas payment using on-line banking and the cash just hit my MtGox account a few minutes ago. I could use it straight away to buy coins.
not sure what i'll have to do now to move the coins, but that's all part of the fun.
