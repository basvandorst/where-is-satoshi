How is VR related to bitcoin?

It's not just graphics, it's the ux
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:10:55
Seriously, just hire a designer

Everyone knows bitcoin is an NSA honeypot project, right?
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:01:19
Shame on them for attempting to market their product!

How much money have your made from Zerohedge insights in the last, oh, 5 years?
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:10:21
I guess it just shows how trivial it is to build
@_date: 2016-03-11 15:35:21
Bitcoin is not about ease-of-use

Or you could've bought during the last peak at $1000 and cut your investment in half

Nice! Do you mostly work on your own projects or do you have a day job?

Negative interest rates have been used several times in the past by other countries

Can you share the link to the MOOC outline? I only see the Stanford course outline
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:56:41
Regarding  : bitcoin is actually super capitalist.   Some argue it represents the purest form free from socialist intervention. What makes you think it isn't capitalist?
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:49:31
This author doesn't know the difference between a miner and a node.  Yikes.
@_date: 2016-01-06 05:40:08
Looks like they are thinking of offering a MOOC too.  Fine I guess, but is this really important news to most of us? Honestly most people in this sub are more interested in HODLing than building shit

Customers know what their problems are, but not necessarily the optimal solution.  It's up to the engineers to build that solution

1) Ridiculous source
2) Cherry picked stats
3) Many of these stats are arguably good news

Your misogynistic comment embodies everything wrong and narrow minded about this community that I hate.  I love bitcoin but I'm frankly ashamed by the company Im forced to keep.  Grow up
@_date: 2015-11-28 22:59:25
Yah I don't disagree that it's cheaper.  However I think their idea is that it's a better ux to just plug it in and never worry about an account for every device.  Getting bitcoin to the unwashed masses as easily as possible.  Anyways who knows, seems like we learn something new about them every week...
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:10:46
Sure whatever that's just one company that gets a lot of press.  There are many more working on it

I'm a big fan of this project :)

I just think it's super easy (and fun) to criticize, especially when you're obviously not the target demographic.  I'd say 90% of the people in this subreddit (myself included) couldn't write code worth 2 shits, let alone develop for bitcoin.  Give it time and watch people build amazing bitcoin apps with it.  Then watch the wave of people say "see? Ive always believed in it" lol smh
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:45:44
Scarce, useful, and necessary (you can only pay tax in $, and if you don't you go to jail).

Explain to me why calling it "end-to-end money" will get regular people interested?
Here is the thing : right now everyone is focused on replacing existing financial systems with systems based on bitcoin.  For the average person, the normal financial systems work just fine.  They are simple, widely adopted, and convenient.  Bitcoin offers no advantage for 99% of normal daily use cases.
IMHO, we should stop trying to replicate existing use cases.  Instead, we need to find/invent use cases where regular financial systems simply cannot provide a solution.
The first wave was illegal applications (drugs, money laundering, etc).  We should focus on finding the next wave.  Personally I think it's going to be machine-to-machine and microtransactions/microwork/DAOs.  Basically skynet.
@_date: 2015-11-17 06:24:23
Lol...I think your answer explains it all
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:07:48
That's how markets work.  Someone will always have a price

Why spend $0.05 to power your tv.  Seems like you're just wasting electricity
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:41:58
I dunno.  Seems like all the mods are anti 21.  I'm surprised they aren't sensoring it actually
@_date: 2015-10-01 22:07:56
Serious question : do you think reddit discussion has any meaningful impact on the people who are seriously working on bitcoin technology, businesses, applications?  Personally I doubt it has as much of an impact as we assume.  They are going to keep working regardless.  Their goal isn't to please us
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:57:42
Anyone know if this is legit?
@_date: 2015-10-30 05:49:13
You guys know you can (potentially) make way more trading regular old options any day of the week, right?
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:37:03
Think about the consumer version.  Does your mom know how to work a wallet? Even if it's just adding a credit card, having the device auto load is 0-step user experience
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:11:52
I'm actually always surprised how anti-corporate a lot of r/bitcoin is.  Libertarianism and free markets don't preclude large companies.

Sorry, but the UI looks like trash.  It's also busted on mobile
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:05:14
Are bitcoin companies allergic to designers? I like the concept but it looks like someone put it together in Word
