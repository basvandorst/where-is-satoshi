This is what is tripping me up a bit. What you should be left with is the number of times a key hashes to a certain value. If a node does not have the transaction in the node's mempool, how can the transaction be obtained?
As a simple example, let's say that I have the word, "coin." If I split it up into four separate parts, I have [c, hash(c)], [o, hash(o)], [i, hash(i)], [n, hash(n)]. My remainder table would just have a single entry for hash(c), hash(o), hash(i), and hash(n) (they each are hashed to a single time). If I don't know that "coin" is a possible answer (it isn't in my mempool), then it should be cryptographically difficult to reverse the hashes to obtain the word "coin." 
Additionally, if this methods relies on hash collisions to reduce space, wouldn't the probability of all pieces of a transaction colliding be relatively high?

The threats of centralization, regulation, increasing transaction fees, and scalability will not be the downfall of bitcoin because of its flexibility and adaptability regarding these problems. If something kills bitcoin, it will be innovation in a new financial technology so vastly different from bitcoin that bitcoin cannot be modified to obtain its features. Seeing as how innovative bitcoin already is, I would welcome such a champion to kill bitcoin as well as welcome the community to back bitcoin's successor. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:31:43
Well, assuming that it was perfectly stable, it would be able to hold value better than the USD because of the USD's inflation. Aside from that, it can be difficult to transfer money peer-to-peer with current fiat setups. Personally, I think that if it was stable, its non inflationary property would be enough to get the ball rolling and overcome the network effect of fiat. (And yes, I know that it does inflate but at a very small pace).
Also, I don't see the BTC protocol being what most consumers use in place of credit cards. I'd expect a credit card-like system to be developed to speed up transactions and provide fraud security while BTC transactions replace bank transfers and p2p exchanges.
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:21:45
While it is easy to cancel most automated systems, doing so requires at least a trivial amount of effort. In comparison, it requires effort to continue paying in a manual system. Even though the effort required is minimal, it forces the consumer to reconsider whether or not they still need the product every month. So yes, a Bitcoin-based automated system would be more appealing to merchants than a Bitcoin-based manual payment system.

If the USD was a free-market currency then accepting it would mean accepting the FR's printing. The reason why 'printing money' is bad is because the USD is legal tender and thus people are forced to accept the system, non-voluntarily.

Ah, okay. So similar to how BitPay and Coinbase allow for adoption by merchants who are reluctant to deal directly in bitcoin, bitpesa now allows Kenyans to fluidly exchange local currency for bitcoin (and integrate bitcoin into their payment scheme), thus easing the inevitable full-transition. 
Edit: I was under the impression that, with such weak local currencies, locals would jump on bitcoin without the need for such an "easing solution."

If it takes 1/21 millionth of all of the currency to buy a beer then what do you think would happen if 22 million people wanted to buy a beer at the same time? The market cap needs to be larger to support lots of small payments, which trump the demand of a few large payments. Additionally, not all Bitcoin in existence is liquid at any given time.

To add to this, when people accept BTC, they accept the mining of BTC by others. When people accept the USD, they accept the printing of money by the FR. While the printing of money by the FR is non-predictable (unlike BTC), the main difference is that the US government mandates that the USD is to be considered legal tender, thus forcing people to accept it while BTC is accepted voluntarily. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:48:18
I'm not sure exactly to what you're referring but there are many ways that people could benefit monetarily from bitcoin. 
You may be referring to mining (which for the most part isn't profitable for the average Joe). 
It certainly can save money by cutting down on transaction fees. 
People can use it to distribute content easier (they can get paid anywhere around the world instantly), which can help them make money.
Bitcoin can remove the burden of fiat currencies from people, especially in places where the local currency is highly inflationary. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:31:33
So if holding a private key and 'locked' file is all that is required for experiencing the content then the key can be easily distributed along with the file. There has to be a system in place for the sender of a key to lose access to the key's use as the receiver gains use of the key. If there isn't then it can be infinitely replicated.

I suggest creating a new bank account to which only you have access.
Bitcoin isn't meant to be anonymous (it's stored in a public ledger after all), but bitcoin doesn't have to be associated with other accounts. Once you move it out of Coinbase, no one has a way of knowing who owns the bitcoin unless you choose to associate yourself with them.

To rebut your father, I'd say that the free market is far better suited for solving the problems of the economy than the government (i.e. a small board on the Fed). Printing money and causing inflation is akin to stealing, like a tax but affecting the less wealthy. As others have said, structural problems won't be solved by printing more money.

One way a QC could attack the network is by attacking ECDSA (deriving the private key from the public key which is sent over the network upon making a transaction). I assume that this is to what you're referring. Early last year the NSA said that they were working on a QC to do just that. Breaking ECDSA is a very easy optimization problem to solve.
A second way a QC could attack the network, to which I was originally referring, is by representing the mining process as an optimization problem. They would effectively be able to compute the hash in O(sqrt(n)) time, thus giving them nearly 100% of the hashing potential.

There is an incentive. When a new block is propagating, the IBLT will only be able to recreate the newblock if the difference between the nodes' currently working mempool and the newblock is less than a certain threshold (~1500 transactions). If the miner decides not to include any 0 fee transactions and other miners/nodes decide to include them, then when the miner finds a block, it may not be within this threshold, causing the newblock to be orphaned.

It think that his confusion was that he took the statement "hoarding increases prices" to mean that when there is an excess of hoarding, there will always be increasing prices (not true if there is low demand). What the statement actually means is that hoarding produces prices that are higher than the price would be without the same level of hoarding.

If you aren't familiar with computer engineering, power usage of a chip is proportional to f*v^2 where v is voltage and f is frequency. Because it normally takes a higher voltage to run at a higher frequency (in a linear manner, f~v), power is more or less proportional to frequency cubed. A significant amount of power can be saved by underclocking, which could then make it more profitable to underclock.

In computer science, O(1) means that there is a constant cost for scaling, compared to O(n) which means that there is a linear relationship between scaled size and cost. Currently, we use an O(n) model which means that there is a high cost once bitcoin scales to a decent size. This solution will augment/replace the current system to allow for O(1) block propagation, greatly reducing bandwidth costs and delay. 
Additionally, there currently is an inherent incentive built into the system for miners to include less transactions (because the more transactions included, the higher the chance that a block that they find will be orphaned). This solution will give incentive to include as many transactions as possible to ensure that the node 'keeps up' with the rest of the network (if the newest block contains too many transactions that a node doesn't have in its mempool, the node will incur a costly resynchronization).

The libertarian response to this would be that if this happened and the owner had policies that weren't commonly liked then it would create a demand in the market for a solution (because such a solution would be profitable since people are willing to pay for it). Most people claim to not know all the answers of how the free market would address issues (since it contains the collective intelligence of the entire populous), but two solutions off of the top of my head are building new roads and exits by a new provider to alleviate the monopoly or a third-party company that deals in peanuts and will exchange and transport your money into peanuts so that it is easy to comply with the rules of the current owner.

My issue is that I want easy access to a single wallet from multiple devices. Online wallets such as Blockchain.info are good for this purpose but they don't give the user the security of exclusive access over one's keys (if the server gets hacked then I could lose my BTC). Syncing wallet files between each device isn't practical because every transaction should have a new change address. Electrum is clunky at best (often tries to sync to servers which don't work, requiring manual selection of a server, and doesn't always update one's balance correctly) and has a non-friendly android app. Because of this, I'm looking for a better alternative (I've heard good things about Hive).

Bitcoin usually is synonymous with the currency but the concept of a blockchain, as a distributed ledger, can go much further than a currency. Things such as colored coins can be used to track ownership of physical objects, stocks, etc. There are also smart-contracts where the sky is the limit. Imagine a future where literally everything is decentralized down to a very granular level. As a quick example, imagine for a second that UPS, FedEx, and USPS didn't exist. Instead, we could have a system of smart contracts where you sign a contract with someone to deliver a package. If they don't deliver it, the contract will give the sender a sum of collateral. If they do deliver it, the collateral is released back to the transporter along with a fee from the sender. The transaction is completed when it is signed by a recipient's private key and all of this is encoded in a blockchain. The contracts could be handed-off between multiple parties in exchange for part of the transportation fee (e.g. $10 fee total, the person who takes it to a plane to be delivered gets $2 and the plane continues on with $8 worth of potential transportation revenue which can then be traded to another ground shipper later). In this manner, pretty much every single good and service can be provided by smart contracts on a digital ledger, trustlessly.

So would you want to format a message to the recipient as a table with entries of the signed message (like the word "proof" that has been signed with the private key), the public key, corresponding bitcoin address (redundant), amount of bitcoin on this address (also redundant since you can look it up)?

The ETF will happen but I imagine that it won't be too successful when people can simply hold bitcoins directly. A bitcoin ETF only gives people the ability to invest in Bitcoins as a commodity but doesn't give them any of the revolutionary benefits.

I think that you're slightly confused as to how to innards of the exchange works. The exchange works with bids/asks--people go on and offer to buy/sell bitcoin at different prices. So if the price of bitcoin is 600 USD on an exchange and I bought 1000 BTC, then I may have bought all of the bitcoins that were offered for $600. Past this, there may be some people who are selling at $610, some at $620, and so on and so forth.

The news has nearly no effect on the price of BTC. The changes in price of BTC that coincide with the news are due to tension building up in the market which is only released upon bad news which is inevitable to happen at least once a week--the amplitude of the change in value being very predictable. Using models such as normalized fibonacci projections, one can easily see that BTC will go to something like 700-720 USD within the next week and then fall for the next 3 months to about 550. After that, it will rise back to 700 over the following 3 months and then jump another order of magnitude in price (a total of 6 months from now).

Doesn't this defeat the purpose? If all of the transaction data is included in the table then it would take up as much space (if not more in practice) than the block itself. Shouldn't the table only include the count (which would be the 'value' in the key-value pair) and the key, which would be the hash of a piece of a transaction? This way, there can only be as many table entries as there are possible hashes (keeping the procedure O(1)).

No because the difficulty increases with the global hash rate. 
Edit: as iuROK said, yes blocks do come slower after a difficulty increase but this is due to the difficulty change being discrete (non-continuous)--if it re-targeted more often then it would hypothetically increase with hash rate and provide the illusion that they always come at similarly distributed intervals.

Whenever someone goes into debt, they do so by investing capital that has been loaned to them by another entity. The problem of everyone not being able to withdraw their money from a bank at the same time would be the same problem as people not being able to reclaim currently invested capital in a p2p loaning marketplace. 
For instance, if I get a loan from an individual (not a bank but someone like a VC), to go to a university, then I will go into debt. If he tries to reclaim this debt right after I get out of college, he won't be able to collect because I haven't earned money to pay it back yet. 
The purpose of a bank is to smooth loan investing by throwing everyone's money into a big fluid pot so that people can effectively sell their loans (to the bank) whenever they need in order to withdraw money. This would be like the VC selling the loan that he gave me to someone else, right after I got out of college, in order to immediately collect.

The solution simply assists in the network layer of the procedure. The transactions still end up in a block which gets added to the blockchain. If the max block size is 1 MB and the minimum transaction size is 250 bytes, then there is a max of 4000 transactions per block. This limit will not be surpassed simply by making the transfer of blocks faster. In order to get more than 4000 transactions in a 10 minute interval, there still needs to be an increase in the max block size.

Do you have examples of economies that have died due to lack of inflation? I don't see non inflationary currencies causing people to hoard more; people will still want their money to grow and will invest it as they do now. I would go as far as saying that an economy based on non inflationary interest rates would actually do better because of lower risk associated with borrowing.
As for the example of inflation hurting the big guys more, money has diminishing returns in value. That $15 would be worth more to the poor guy than the 1.5m would be worth to the billionaire.

I assume that you're fairly new to Bitcoin (correct me if I'm wrong). A confirmation refers to the transaction being recorded in a valid block in the blockchain (more than 1 confirmation means that multiple blocks have been built on top of the block in which your transaction is included). When conducting business with a merchant, they usually don't require a confirmation to consider a transaction finalized (i.e. they say that you're a-okay before your transaction is recorded in a block). The transaction is finalized when the merchant (or merchant service like BitPay or Coinbase) sees your transaction on the network (even before it's confirmed). 
Edit: this makes paying nearly instant.

So MtGox is connected through the network to miners who need to accept a transaction in order to add it to their working block. When MtGox sends a transaction, one of the miners/nodes can invalidate the transaction. What happens at this point? Is the invalidated transaction distributed to other miners, thus making them not accept it? What causes the nodes/miners to keep distributing the malformed transaction and not drop it? Why doesn't MtGox send this transaction to several nodes/miners so that if one of them is malicious, a valid version of the transaction will still go through? 
Does the malformation simply change an identifier that MtGox checks to see is in the next accepted block to verify the transaction and not actually invalidating the transaction?

What is the alternative to such a system [serious]? The *want* that is satisfied is that of loaning the coin to Alice. The bank uses the collective deposits to fund the loan, giving Bob and Jane lower interest in exchange for mitigating loan risk (and facilitating the loan). 
The only other way that I see this working is if the bank has its own starting capital and never loans out more than this amount. What is the point of people depositing money in such a system, other than having a *secure* place to hold it (this may be the main source of my confusion)?

As a reply to your now deleted comment: 
Because of the nature of bitcoin not allowing charge-backs and PayPal allowing charge-backs, it will always be hard to purchase bitcoin with PayPal. The only way that VirWox can support PayPal is through large fees. Coinbase has a 1% fee because EFTs are not reversible, meaning that they incur less risk. I'd suggest creating a new private bank account where you are the only one with access to avoid privacy issues.

The coins part can be a bit misleading to newcomers (makes them think that it isn't divisible) but I think that there wasn't a good alternative.

If the reward dropped now then miners would leave the market as power/hardware costs would not outweigh the mined coins. This would have little effect on the actual price in bitcoin immediately.

Then how does this work? Normally, to my understanding, HD wallets take the seed +1, +2, +3, +4, etc. to create private keys. Would this mean that the same private key is used on multiple blockchains or is the ticker incremented for each key creation (like, if two keys are made for bitcoin then 1 for litecoin, would the litecoin key be made from seed+1 or seed+3?)? If they share the same key then this would open cross-chain attacks up to any public key encryption exploitation (since the public key is exposed on one chain when funds are spent).

I just watched the video. To clarify something, there are two different "times." There is the confirmation time which takes on average 10 minutes and means that your transaction has been recorded in a block. As the end-user, this doesn't mean much to you except that it is the time required before that particular bitcoin can then be sent again. 
There is also a transaction time limit, which is imposed by the merchant or merchant service. This is the time that you're seeing (counting down from 10:00). This time limit is imposed to make sure that customers can't take advantage of bitcoin's price volatility. Once the merchant service sees your transaction, this timer disappears and the transaction is finalized (no fast-forwarding occurred in the video).

Coinbase does not give you direct access to your bitcoins (that I'm aware of). Coinbase accounts are similar to bank accounts in that they hold your bitcoin and show you a balance but you can't directly move the original money that you put in. Because of this, most people advise not storing bitcoin on coinbase.
Your private key gives you access to bitcoins sent to its corresponding address. You can have multiple transactions sent to a single address, and therefore accessible with a single private key, but it is recommended to use a different address (and therefore private key) for each transaction.
Each input/output has its own private key. If I send you 1 BTC then it would be accessible using 1 private key. If I sent you .5 BTC then it would also be accessible with a single private key (assuming all in a single transaction, ignoring multi-sig).

The USD is "several orders of magnitude larger than" bitcoin but you think that the value proposition of bitcoin is enough to overcome the network effect of the USD (as do I). Surely, if there was an alternative with an even higher value proposition, it would also be able to overcome bitcoin? 


Are there any features that bitcoin wouldn't be able to adapt and would require a complete reboot to implement?

How are they unable to see if it was received on a public ledger?

In all fairness, you have quite a memorable name.

Monetary inflation via printing money is simply another form of theft performed by the government; not to sound too ancappy. Alternately, they could go around every day taking a small percentage of people's money from every account and stash that they had (which is far less practical). Inflation caused by the FR is bad, not only for moral reasons of counterfeiting, but also for practical reasons of them taking value out of the economy where people would use it more wisely.
Edit: think of it this way. The fear of inflation causing people to invest and spend in the now is offset by the fact that the monetary system is inflating and causing their returns to be worth less and therefore have less to invest.

I'd also like the same answer for android (there doesn't seem to be a "default" application for this under application settings).

A p2sh address is an address created with a script instead of a single private/public key. They are commonly seen in multisig addresses and start with a 3 instead of a 1.

Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and savior, Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:29:22
Thank you--you've greatly improved my understanding!
So if you were to hypothetically send your public key with the encrypted message then the original is not needed (because it can be derived). But with bitcoin addresses, you can verify that an address is associated with the private key used to encrypt a message if you have the message and the encrypted message (but there is no way to get the original message from only the address and encrypted message)?

HTTPS (SSL) is not vulnerable to MITM attacks because such an attack cannot replicate a valid certificate signed by a trusted third party such as Verisign.

SHA, while possible to crack with a QC, is very difficult to crack and probably won't be cracked by a QC for quite some time. ECDSA can be easily cracked with the current technology.

But wouldn't people be willing to be paid in it and accept it if it was stable? Those issues seem trivial once stability is achieved:)

Just wondering, why did you store 35 BTC on brainwallet which is known to be non-secure? (want to know purely for purposes of educational deficiency in the bitcoin community.) 
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:31:33
Ah, thanks. Sorry, I misread it as "through their website."

Very well produced video. The only gripe that I have is that it dumbs down hashing a bit too much. While the innards of hashing algorithms do not need to be known by the average person, knowing what a hash really is can be useful for non technical persons (see: checksums, etc.). Good lock analogy for guessing nonces, though.

Bitcoin is not virtual.

I haven't been able to watch the video yet because I'm at work but I assume that they give you 10 minutes to pay (to avoid for people abusing price variance), and they consider the transaction finalized with 0 confirmations.

[Value]( is subject to change via changes in supply and demand. As people's needs change and the number of people change, demand can change. As the number of houses change, the supply changes.

Did Ross launder any transactions or simply host the site where people conducted illegal activities? It seems like his intent was simply hosting the site and any illegal activities were conducted by the users. Wouldn't associating him with these illegal activities be a transfer of intent/blame?

Does "basic" include conversion to USD?

The current implementations of the Bitcoin core only accepts blocks up to 1 mb. This can be changed if/when needed but currently limits the number of transactions/sec. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:39:42
This is.... amazing!

Okay, a more ELI5 version would be:
This makes it easier for nodes to download blocks as bitcoin becomes more popular. Also, it makes miners include more transactions and reduces fees significantly.

Just wondering, is it standard operating procedure to store BTC values in doubles or in number of satoshis (int)?
