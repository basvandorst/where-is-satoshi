I'm sensin' a double bubble.
Shit's gonna get big.

yes.  I'd agree with you there- supply and demand are at a weird state of affairs right now as the ASIC's are being brought into the network.
Right now, bitcoin prices are subdued because of the fact that ASIC's are coming into the network.  Due to the fact that we haven't yet reached ASIC "saturation," power costs per bitcoin mined are relatively low, giving miners a tidy profit even though the cost has been on a slight downward trend over the last couple of weeks.  As more ASIC's come online, the exchange rate will have to go up for the miners to be making a profit.  Supply and demand.

oh yes.  Maybe coming a lot sooner than it would have otherwise, what with bitcoins and all.

There's no volume in between $87 bids and $89 asks.  Whatever happens, it'll be volatile.

Software folks in general would be a good place to start.  Specifically, open-source hackers would be a nice group to talk to.  Alternatively, you could try approaching the people that make electronic voting machines and informing them of the merits of the idea.  They probably have incentive not to take it up though (large sunk costs in their current voting systems).
I stuck your thread up on hacker news here ( to get in in front of the eyeballs of some people that hopefully have a better technical understanding of this subject.

holy shit this is a great idea.
Bring this to the attention of people who can implement it.  Definitely.
Like, seriously.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:00:20
I really believe that bitcoin is reaching the "tipping point," so to speak, among the general population.  It'll be great to see it help people in the future- travelling students will be able to accept funds from their parents while abroad, people will never have to fear seized accounts, and businesses like paypal will have to starve or innovate.
So yeah, spread that word.  Spread it good.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:33:26
hehehe yes I have.  I anticipate some pretty great gifs.

I would say that bitcoin is a better currency than gold but a worse store of value.
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:03:09
Looks like it does little that impacts Bitcoin users- mostly impacts those who own/ operate bitcoin trading and other services.
It is good to see the US gov't lending legitimacy to BTC as well.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:08:45
this is true.

His moderately bullish stance should shine a good light on him for his peers- other bankers will recognize that he's well informed about bitcoin, but will be less likely to dismiss him as "a loonie thinking bitcoin will go to a million."
Good political play on his part.

I feel like btc-e usually trades low because the troll box introduces a lot of fear and uncertainty to their exchange.

this is untrue.  Low and high are the lowest and highest prices at which trades occurred within a certain time period, which I believe is 24 hours for the mtgox ticker.

It's funny that they even call it a ponzi scheme outright- they're pretty confident that people will fall for it anyway!

I would recommend diversifying more than that- the money from that 20k is still tremendously important in her situation.  There are risky bets that can pay off in the stock market too- in particular, my go-to ETF for high risk, high rewards is SVXY.  Look it up on yahoo finance and maybe seekingalpha.com to get a good idea of its risks and rewards.
You could also put the money in less risky investment vehicles.

I don't think there was as large of a population growth back in 2011, but I'm not sure if there's any data on it either.
A good metric would be a timeline of mtgox total deposit balance, if it exists.

Looks like its already heading back up at 69.00 and steady (organic, not forced wall) support from below.

people fear what they don't understand- which is a pretty natural reaction, I suppose.
Now more understanding is proliferating, as the journalists are becoming more familiar with the currency.
