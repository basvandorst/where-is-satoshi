Miko is the current candidate but I’ll try for Satoshi &amp; Bit!

It largely depends on breeds.

Golden doodle :)

I second this! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:04:56
I will try and get her to consider Satoshi, dunno why I didn’t think of that! Currently we were thinking ‘Miko’.

Thank you! I’ll make sure she Hodl’(s?) well!

I second this, but it’s sad because Dogecoin will have 100 billion doge coins &amp; there are around maybe 50-60 million dogs in the world. 
Time to hoard Dogecoins!

Oh don’t worry, I bought back in on the dip!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:18:08
Oh I’m definitely trying to get her to take another. She usually has two dogs at once. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:17:22
Thank you! Merry Christmas to you as well!

Took me a minute ��
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:31:31
Oh my mom has been hodling her all day that’s for sure.
Would be nice to get a second one to hodl in a few months!

Golden doodle. I’ve fallen in love with the breed after spending time with the pups parents.

Haha, if I had approximately  172379.32 doge coins at the time of purchase I’d of done it honestly
