Lol at the government as subtle.  There are tons of examples where they simply shut stuff they don't like down, like here: 
You're confusing "astroturfing" for bank AML laws that have been in place for 20+ years.  Once a bitcoin engages in banking on US soils, they're subject to the same laws.  There's nothing specific to bitcoin about those laws.

Those are the simplest units possible...it's the price of 1 ETH...

All of your examples actually work in my favor.
"War on poverty":  how many Americans starve to death each year?  The definition of "poverty" in America is the equivalent of middle-class in much of the world.  There are people "in poverty" with smartphones, televisions, cars, and obesity.  Even with all that said, the idea of a "war on poverty" has always been something of a joke that we've never even really attempted.  
"war on terrorism."  Since 9/11, how many successful terrorist attacks have occurred on US soil?  We've had fewer total deaths due to terrorism since 9/11 than on 9/11 itself.
Drugs are something of a special case, since lots of people routinely risk 10+ years of jail time to consume them.  My whole point is that *most* bitcoin users would not risk substantial jail time to use bitcoin.

Ah, true.  redundant.

I already explained that with drugs, some people are willing to risk 10+ years in jail to use them, and there's more than 300k non-violent offenders currently in prison for drug use.  My whole point with bitcoin is that most bitcoin users are not willing to go to jail for it.  Are you really suggesting that we could have 300k people in jail for bitcoin use?  That's what your analogy would take to use the war on drugs as an example of a failure that could be applied to bitcoin.
Your link to poverty is also nonsensical.  As I already explained, almost all of those people in "poverty" are middle-class by global standards.  They're people with televisions and all the food they can eat.  
Lastly your link on terrorism is again nonsensical.  It's global deaths from terrorism.  The US declared a war on terrorism against the US.  We don't try to police domestic terrorism in other countries.  
Again, we've succeeded against terrorism.  There was more terrorism on 9/11 than in the 15 years after it combined.

No you've got it backwards.  He didn't inherit bitcoin.  He made a conscious decision to leave a very successful company he founded specifically to focus on investing in bitcoin.

I agree with just about everything you wrote.  The one thing I think you're overlooking is that inflation is almost always primarily a wage phenomena.  I.e. wages rise with inflation (almost always).  The losers are people with dollar assets (including the holders of debt of governments and individuals).  The winners are people who owe dollar assets (net debtors, or levered institutions that effectively borrow at a fixed rate and invest at floating.)
It's very tough for the printing of money to reduce real wages (where "real" means after inflation), since real wages are determined by the worker's marginal productivity.  Unless the money printing actually destroys national productivity, real wages should be relatively unchanged, meaning that nominal wages must rise with inflation.

Adam Back, CEO of blockstream and god of the core devs proposed a 2-4-8 MB scaling back in August of 2015.

You've got it backwards.  Inflation hurts people who already have lots of money and helps those who earn salaries.  It reduces the real cost of debt.  This was why the populists of the last century wanted money to be based on silver (inflationary) not gold (deflationary.)

The halvening just decreases the rate of the increase in supply.  The supply is still constantly increasing.

The opposite is true.  Bitcoin PoW wastes huge amounts of electricity (and therefore oil, metal, and other commodities).
In contrast, few consumable commodities are used as money.   No one is using wheat or sugar or raw steel as money.

Peer to peer file sharing has never been illegal in the US, you're confused.  There's never been a law against installing Napster or Limewire.
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:51:20
If that was true, they would just ban it.  If the US and EU made it illegal to exchange or own bitcoin or operate a node, bitcoin would lose 95% of its users overnight.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:35:12
Not really.  The blocks are already almost full.  It's not like having full blocks would represent substantial growth at this point.  Just 15% more transactions and we stagnate.

I made 500% on the way up with no margin/leverage then just sold (-:  Just bought at $1 ETH/USD and sold at $6 ETH/USD

Lol at calling rallies and sell-offs pump and dumps.  It's called "volatility" and "price appreciation."  You just sound sore at missing out.  Almost everyone who's ever bought an ETH has made money at this point.  Can't say the same for bitcoin.
