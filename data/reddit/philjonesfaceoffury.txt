I benefit from referral but I tried to present information in a useful way for beginners that want to join to provide some value.  I would have glanced at few months ago when I was researching about to join.

This is something I have wondered about.  What is to stop asshole corporations from seeing all the promising crypto use cases open source projects are creating and patenting the idea before they finish out.  Is power ledger and a couple other coins attempting similar ideas to this before December 2017?

We are getting close to another death cross on 3 day chart, if this happens it means more pain before finding support back on the 50day MA so we can go up again.  Until we can break and hold the 200day MA you are a little crazy to at least not be cautious there may be more down side.  Look at historical charts what happens when we can’t get over the 200 day, not a lot of info because it only happened once but I would advise caught until we break hand hold mid 7k’s imo.

I am not am not saying it will happen or it would be smart to try and sell to catch the bottom. Just saying if you pay attention to charting if a couple variables don’t change it is the likely case short term.  I don’t see much difference in long term value of bitcoin at $5800 compared to $6300 so I think those same people will be buying now if that was the case.  I am not selling because I have not reached my bitcoin target.  You can go to sleep for Year wake up and it won’t matter if you buy now but for people paying attention to charting we need to hold $6500 for extended period and then break mid 7ks before more upside.  Maybe that is me just wishing we get bitcoin Black Friday sale for the few of us left grinding up our bitcoin stack before the next bull run.

IMO big players pay attention to market psychology and volume of sell offs to see how low they can take it.  They will keep pushing price down to buy in cheaper than the next guy and when all sellers have been exhausted, and only holders left are willing to go to 0 to support the ideas behind bitcoin.  Then big money will finally take it back up creating the fomo train for normal investors to jump in late and lose money on.  
I don’t understand the logic behind everyone’s scam thinking that BTC is manipulated and will never go back up.  If BTC is so easily manipulated up and down why would the said manipulators stop use of that money making machine while it lasts, you can’t actually believe just because a handful of investors got burned that there are not plenty more fish in the sea for plunders next run.  
TLDR;  Even if bitcoin does not have a good use case and is purely manipulated up and down for profits, why would you think the manipulators would not continue the same profit making trends going into the future until we start seeing long term jail sentences or large fines for market manipulation handed out?

Haha nope just talking shit, I’m going to do the work on Arkansas and post that even if it is they have no stance.  If no stance, I will send an email and try and get a response if they are interested in learning.  I have been one of those lazy Americans in past and was ignorant in politics until my mid 20’s.  Trying to get more involved in blockchain community and do my part for adoption.  Maybe I didn’t choose the best words for motivation...,
