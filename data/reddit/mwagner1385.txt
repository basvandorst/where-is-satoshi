We are not living in the 1770s anymore.  If anything, [Jefferson would be wondering why we haven't rewritten the Constitution evert 20 or so years] (  The purpose of the Rev War was not to not ever pat taxes.  It was because taxes were being controlled by the Crown and the colonists had no right to voice their dissent or opinion.  If Britain had allowed the colonists a representative or some voice in Parliament, there is likely not a rev war... or if there was, not until significantly later.

I do own a car... I came from a family of factory workers and they ensured me a good living and education so that I can make sure that I stay ahead of being obsolete in a workforce.  They understood that was something that would happen.  Automation is happening whether we like it to or not... And we need to address what we are going to do when tens of millions will be out of work.  That is a discussion for another day.  But that education is helping me live better than my parents even when my generation is falling behind in that aspect.  I have a phone... not an iphone, but i definitely can imagine that condtions arent wholely fantastic compared to Foxcon.  And they are a shitty corporation and I wish people would get over their overpriced, underperforming, easily broken shitty iphones.  But me being a liberal doesn't make me have some coping mechanism.  I eat meat, i came from a family that hunts, but i was taught that you kill an animal as efficient as possible, i just want the way animals are treated to br better before and during the process of death.  But i know that i have a responsibility to others to make sure that others who cannot fend for themselves are taken care of.  I think people with addictions should have better access to seek help, I think the sick should have access tl healthcare regardless of their station in life.  I am willing to pay my part of the social contract that is being a human living in a society because I care about people and others doing better than they are now, means I will do better as well.

You really think you can just put money into an investment and take gains and not pay taxes on it?  This isn't a bad thing.  it's giving legitimacy to BitCoin and all anyone wants to do is complain about not being able to evade paying taxes.  It's what happens when you live in any country.  Accept that BitCoin is going mainstream and that it is going to come with everything any other investment comes with
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:36:28
I don't think the government is looking at this as a form of currency and if you are using it to transact a good or service that is one thing... but if you are buying and selling bitcoin for investment purposes it needs to be taxed as such.  Bitcoin, i think, is in a weird place right now.  There isn't enough businesses accepting it as currency, but at the same time it's like if i paid you with a stock of Apple for something.  I think Bitcoin brings a weird situation that isn't fully understood by thr government (shocker!)

Are you being affected by it?  If so, then your country will likely be at war if we did.  Which takes taxes to meep your army going for soldier pay and supply.  Imagine if you didn't pay taxes and now you have no army.  Pretty bad news for you isn't it?  That said, I vote, I keep myself well-informed on the bullshit that is going on and have a fairly decent moral compass.  One that involves, wanting to see the less fortunate helped, paying my taxes to do it, and if I go to another country, living by their laws.  I'm going to Thailand this month where mocking the king in anyway is a jailable offense.  You know what I am not going to do?

"There's no transparency".  Clearly he doesn't understand that the code is 100% open sourced.  Also, Who created it is irrelevant... it exists... and lastly, there is nothing backing it up... Demand for a finite resource is what is backing it up.  If everyone decided gold sucks and they don't want it, gold would be worthless.  Everyone who buys it has agreed that a bitcoin has an asset value, no different from gold.  If people stop believing there is value, the currency goes bye bye.

Again, you live in the US and you must abide by its laws.  If you don't like its laws, you have been granted rights to petition and change such laws.  If there was a law that said "you must kill black people" I would hope that Americans would be recalling every one of their congressmen that voted for it, marching on Washington, and having the law repealed before it was ever enacted.  This country relies on voter participation, not just in elections, but in regularly contacting your congressman and senators.  Again, the Constitutional right of the federal government is its right.  Your congressman is your representation.  If you do not like it, i suggest you work with your congressman to change it, or accept it.  That being said, if you refuse to abide by it, you will be recieving contact from the IRS.  You were informed, and warned.

I dumped a couple thousand in and Ibam not choosey about where I do buy in at.  Could have at 9, 10 11 or anywhere in between.  But id youre going to wait for a specific number for a long term investment, youll never buy.  I am buying because there are a number of positive contributors right now.  NASDAQ futures, Accounting firms taking BitCoin.  more news attention to BitCoin and talk or regulation i see as a good thing (not regulation itself, but it gives it a bit of legitimacy).  Do not take these things as reasons why you should buy it... more of... have reasons to buy it.  I am in for a year.  I don't look to make huge profits, although tempting and nice to think about.  But I see things are much more positive and the current holding pattern we are in is healthy.  It may not stop an inevitable bubble from popping to correct... but it does let some air out.
