Nobody i've let try it has tripped. One guy came close because he kept turning in a circle in the same direction.
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:53:50
I already have one, but I'd go for a 2nd one
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:10:36
No you can glid your own comments. It just takes some URL manipulation.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:17:44
Because you don't have alt accounts to have give you them.

Just realized I might be able to buy a Surface Pro 3 with this since they have that!
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:26:19
For Dota, it's possible to create cosmetics which would require a 3D modeler. Or else there's the team banners which can be seen here: 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:52:07


So I can't buy a Surface Pro 3 with my bitcoins yet.
There goes all my hopes and dreams.
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:33:31
I was thinking about the [MakerBot Replicator]( the open-source one.
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:38:54
Quick Google Map Search showed me all the ones in my area. 
Turns out my university also has one.
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:12:20
Sony soon hopefully?
I doubt Nintendo would do something like this
@_date: 2014-10-15 08:20:40
Wonder who actually manage bitcoincodes.com I'm waiting on them to restock on some cards I want.
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:59:45
No replicator 1? That's the one I was looking at to replace my current 3D printer
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:36:43
Now I'm tempted to buy  and get that 500GB ssd too
But I just upgraded
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:27:46
Doesn't Humble Bundle use both Stripe and Coinbase though?
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:12:23
Just keep gliding yourself.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:21:26
Oh I have not seen their guides yet. I'm using stripe for something right now and I love how easy it's been. But I'm using it for a subscription service so not exactly easy to use bitcoins for.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:14:34
Is that [Creator 3D Printer from Makergeeks]( as the [original open source Makerbot](
Been looking at 3D printers but don't know if I want one of those or something like a RepRap
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:29:35
Sounds like a better use than my Pi 2 right now. (Cpumining altcoins)
@_date: 2012-01-02 23:40:31
Seems like I might have to buy a DVD drive.
@_date: 2012-11-03 09:54:07
It's disturbing that I'm making a store with this exact same theme.
@_date: 2012-12-17 04:47:02
Well use the calculator and figure out how long it'll take you to find a block. 
@_date: 2012-04-01 21:36:09
Well I like Grooveshark, if they add Bitcoin payments I'd subscribe.
@_date: 2012-12-17 04:46:02
I did kill the fan on my graphics card by mining too long I think.
About seven months in dorms.
@_date: 2012-07-22 10:01:47
And [Wuala]( which accepts bitcoins. Maybe get a VPS with bitcoins and keep an encrypted version there.
Or maybe email.
@_date: 2012-08-18 21:03:33
Don't know about my video card, but I know bitcoin mining killed my video card fan which I've had no success in replacing.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:35:20
I was gonna say the same thing. I remember reading an article about getting a Tesla there, was considering it.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:12:20
I want to do that, but can you believe I've got like 10 stepper motors but no servos 
@_date: 2011-06-06 20:42:12
Difficulty is supposed to change every 2 weeks. If there are more miners being added, it becomes less than 2 weeks.
@_date: 2011-12-01 20:37:59
I started mining right after the increase in miners or around that time. Was able to generate 3 blocks and now the pools are so slow. Also makes me wish I had started even if just a bit earlier, 3 HD5770s now are like nothing.
Also when Bitcoin peaked, but I'm sure everyone feels like that.
@_date: 2011-06-14 05:53:12
Makes me happy I've got 4 5770s on different computers running :) 
Also is your price for 5970s right? I can't seem to find it by that price
Maybe add links on Newegg?
@_date: 2011-06-28 06:13:07
Bought none, instead used the 3-4 HD5770s to mine for the last 4 months or so. Maybe an extra 50-75$ on my electricity bill each month, current have about 200 BTC.
@_date: 2011-08-17 01:32:11
They don't accept bitcoin or dwolla though
@_date: 2011-06-26 09:02:57
Not me, I wish it had.
Instead my linux knowledge has increased since I bought a VPS.
@_date: 2011-11-29 03:52:27
I've previously registered a domain with Kalyhost. Works fine.
@_date: 2011-05-11 21:07:39
Do you have ATI Stream SDK installed?
@_date: 2011-05-10 22:02:28
No, what happens that that the difficulty is set to have so many blocks be released. The difficulty is set to to scale to have a block be found every ten minutes, but that doesn't happen.  shows the current rate of blocks being found per hour at the top. Currently 7.24
@_date: 2011-05-24 08:31:19
My current solution to this is that Bitcoin runs on my other computer. Everytime I need to spend coins, I VNC into it.
Actually what happened is that I'm just too lazy to move it from my other computer so its staying there. Either way it works as security. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 02:56:13
I'm looking for a domain about now. Maybe 2.
@_date: 2011-04-03 07:31:19
Actually they started this a while ago. It was actually from them that I found out about BitCoins
@_date: 2011-08-21 09:34:54
Because I purchased these cards for gaming, but if they mine when I'm not gaming, that's fine too.
@_date: 2011-05-10 08:40:34
 shows that at 660 MHz, that seems about right, maybe a bit lucky. Yesterday was before the difficulty increase.
@_date: 2011-06-14 08:48:45
Being used to illegal things and being illegal are different. Having a gun is legal, but shooting someone with a gun is illegal.
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:29:36
Thanks alot for reminding me, I just lost a bitcoin now because of you
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:12:53
I'm waiting for a 


@_date: 2016-05-03 08:57:51
Or maybe it wasn't over SSL. With control over the DNS server, I would just not point electrum.org to the SSL page. Unless you're looking for it, I doubt you'd notice it wasn't over SSL
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:11:59
Started solo but joined a pool after 3 blocks or so.
@_date: 2011-05-22 06:23:57
Once its worthless, people will stop mining and the difficulty will decrease until its worthwhile again.
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:23:40
How's tor exit node on a kimsufi? I was considering cancelling my Kimsufi because my friend let me put a computer at his place with 50/50, but might keep it for something like that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:42:07
A bit more and the .5 BTC on my phone is worth more than my phone.
Which means I'll need a new phone.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:31:06
Yeah I would donate for RES Pro.
Whatever that is, just sounds fancy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:10:50
Yet. Time to make a MoonCoin!
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:14:06
Since you are providing a free service, I think it's understandable that everyone is hitting you too hard.
Maybe some people will add to the whiskey fund.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:08:37
It's 1 am. I don't sleep this early.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:49:41
I wasn't even in college for that crash two years ago. I'll make it through this one .
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:10:23
I'm also pretty sure I was joking, but I'm not me so who knows.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:39:18
Do you have it case sensitive? I did the same thing and it found "BitCoin"
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:01:39
West Coast
Best Coast
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:51:25
Well I guess I know what I'm doing from now on.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:48:14
I've had a similar setup to bitcoinstore and I understand that searching is hard to setup on Magento, but adding the tags alone would make it a lot easier to browse.
[Also they use the same theme I used](
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:52:54
Yeah I saw this on the BitCoin trade wiki a few days ago, I was hoping to maybe pickup a portable system like a 3DS or a Vita though
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:51:23
Your source seems to be a dead link. Do you have another?
@_date: 2013-12-31 01:39:50
I've worked for a place that used Yahoo stores, it is so inconvenient. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:38:41
I had 1500! Spent it all on an Amazon giftcard
