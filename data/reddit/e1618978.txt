Fractional reserve banking does not rely on the printing of new money. Banks can create money out of thin air even with a fixed money like Bitcoin or gold. They do it by loaning the money out and having it redeposited. 
If you insist on banks having a 100% reserve requirement, then the whole idea of affordable mortgages and affordable banking will go out the window. Since people want those two things to exist fractional reserve banking will also exist even if Bitcoin or gold is the currency.

I think that a fork would be great - it would finally shut up both the small blockers and the big blockers, they would both have their own playground.  If Ethereum had protection against replay attacks in their fork everything would be fine now.

Your whole argument will also apply to fiat banks and loans, and since fiat fractional reserve banks exist it kind of destroys your argument.
Also people already deposit coins in Coinbase and lose control of precise ownership.
1. Somebody deposits bitcoin to Coinbase or similar 
2. Coinbase loans that bitcoin out to home purchaser
3. Home seller deposits home sale proceeds bitcoin in Coinbase
4. boom - fractional reserve, the same bitcoins are deposited twice in Coinbase
Saying no to fractional reserve baking means saying no to bank loans. Since people need bank loans fractional reserve banking will continue to exist. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:52:43

It would be easy to set up a fractional reserve system for Bitcoin. In fact, it will happen automatically once there is a bank that takes deposits and starts loaning then out to people. As soon as you have a bank that gives out mortgages you automatically have a fractional reserve system.

You can use a combination of mongodb and other things.   Just using mongodb isn't a bad thing, but it becomes a bad thing if you use if for anything important.
In RoR projets I use it to store logs, because there is an awesome ruby plugin that collects all your logs from multiple machines and puts them into one web interface (Mongodb logger gem).
But it only works because if you lose all of your logs it usually isn't a huge deal.   I used MySql for the important stuff, not sure if it was the best choice, but it is way better than mongo.

Bitcoin per share is 0.09525097, so multiplying by 10 is a bit off.   I think it is also misleading to say that they are valuing bitcoin at 10*$52 since the extra value in GBTC is due to the ability to buy it from IRA accounts.  
The price isn't suggesting that Bitcoin is worth more than current market price, it is suggesting that GBTC is worth more than the bitcoins it contains.

You can give $15k away without paying any gift tax. I don't think you need to report anything to the IRS at all unless a single gift was over $15k.

Depends on what you don't like about your current country and what your values are.

For me Switzerland seems pretty appealing, but you never know until you get there and actually live for a while.
The things about the US that I don't like:
- High cost of medical care combined with the baby boomer bubble will bankrupt the country.   Medicare and Social Security have a total npv shortfall that totally dwarfs the official national debt.
- Failure to properly regulate the banking system
- Social conservatives and religious people are always poking their nose into other people's business.
- Crumbling infrastructure
- Not enough help for poor people
- Universities hire people like Krugman at high wages, and then bump up tuition into the stratosphere.   University cost controls seem to work much better in other countries.

Your argument relies on an implicit premise that electronic currency only has value because of user confidence. User confidence contributes, but there is also real value. 
Some kind of electronic currency will take over the foreign remittance business. Whatever coin puts western union, wire transfers and other foreign remittance companies out of business will be worth a lot more than $10 billion.  
If bitcoin is gone, which is a possibility, some other altcoin will have that value.   In fact, an altcoin will probably capture the value anyway, since blocksize limited bitcoin will be too expensive for a Phillipino maid to use to send $100 back home (and too expensive to put Western Union out of business in the first place).
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:23:49
I doubt that you can extend that all the way - if bitcoin goes to zero, altcoins won't go to zero.   These currencies have real world value, people won't say "oh, the Chinese government killed bitcoin, so we won't ever use any kind of electronic currency every again".
If bitcoin dies altcoins will take over and go way up - so it makes sense to protect yourself by putting a chunk into the top altcoins.   Bitcoin doesn't have 100% chance of survival.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:35:41
Government actors will not be able to kill electronic currency - they may be able to kill bitcoin but who cares?  Move 5% of your bitcoin balance into Ethereum and Monero and you no longer will need to care about Bitcoin dying because your altcoin value will skyrocket as your bitcoin value dies.
Right now most bitcoin mining is in China, which gives the Chinese government the ability to take over the miners and use the mining power to corrupt bitcoin to the point of destruction.  Increasing the bandwidth requirements for a mining node will actually cause mining to diversify outside of China and will make bitcoin less fragile.
