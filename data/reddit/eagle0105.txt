Yes, and how does looking up the address on blockchain explorer *using a browser* help?
I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty details with you, because that's not helpful. The point I was trying to make is that your "best practices" is on the wrong level of cautious. Every additional step being taken is a mistake, or another security hole waiting to be made. Look up the last 10 topic here that "I lost my bitcoin", tell me how many would have been help by "real world randomness"? (Pulling out of my ass) I'd dare say that I very large number of lost comes from users' mistake not related to security.
Frankly, I can't vouch for Trezor personally, but as far as I've seen,  should have been: get a trezor.  is using 2FA, and  would be to use password manager.

See the edit on the previous reply.
Even if that specific advice is sound, missing half of the quantifier (use a different device) already turned it bad.

I thought so too, but  is about using blockchain explorer, which is absolutely not necessary for this specific instance: you just need to compare the first and last 5-7 characters to ensure nothing is hijacking the address.

Best practices is not "absolutely best you can do practices". It has to take into practicality, current human behaviours and otherwise. 
Threat modeling need to takes into account both risk (likelihood) of a scenario and the potential loss of that scenario. 
For most user, the threat model to care about is the mass attack via malware, botnet etc (ie untargeted attack), or general phishing attack, not a targeted attack by adversary with high capability. For example, the concept "air gap" should NOT ever be a thing that end-user have to know about. Number 5 is redundant (you can't mistype one or two character in an address and still send to it).
And worse, the advice lacks very basic items that need to be listed: don't run unknown executable, don't download executable from non-source website, check the address of the site you're visiting.

 **DO NOT RUN YOUR OWN MAIL SERVER**, I repeat, **DO NOT RUN YOUR OWN MAIL SERVER**. 
I've said this before on r/bitcoin, and I will say this again: throwing out random "security advice" and applying them randomly don't make you secure. You need to know who you're defending again, have your appropriate threat model, and act accordingly.
Security issue asides, setting up and maintaining a mail server is a hellishly nightmare process. Mail won't get to your server, your outgoing mail got blocked by other servers, spam is not a fun thing to deal with. And you know what? An unsecured random mailserver probably has a higher chance to be taken by a random bored attacker than a random gmail account.
On the topic of threat modeling, if you have a few thousands dollar, a mailserver will cost more in term of your own time. On the other hand, if it's your entire life savings in magnitude of millions of dollars, do you have physical security to the server? Are you sure you're always watching it? You're probably storing it in some sort of offline storage, which makes running mailserver or not irrelevant.
Believe it or not, it's actually hard to get in a gmail account if you have verify your phone with it, and/ or enable two steps authentication.

You might have got it backward, the advice of running your own email server is the blanket advice, and you have to justify it. Running your own mailserver do NOT keeps your email out of anyone's hand, for several reasons:
- Everyone who communicate with you have a copy of it, and by extension, their mail server.
- Email is delivered in plain text, which means that any interested mail server can capture it if they want to. Your emails go through a lot of server any time it's sent. TLS only help stopping MITM, it doesn't solve the main issue with email itself being plain text.
- There are a millions more reasons to be listed. But let me make this short with one question. Are you claiming that it's in the ability of "technical people" who are not "security expert" to setup and maintain a working email server running 99.99% uptime and has lower chance to be broken in than a phone-verified with 2 factor gmail account?
I will assume that you know what you are talking about, which means you have to realize that "keep the OS up to date" is a nontrivial task. I mean, at the very least think about the irony of advising people who lost access to their gmail due to the lack of two factors auth to setup a mailserver. Do you really envision that ever going well?

The context of the thread has nothing to do with the situation like you. My comment was in a thread about someone losing their account, with the top comment being a "security advice" that tell people it's good security measurement (not privacy, mind you) to run their own server.
Between a short blanket advice of "don't stick your dick in the socket" and "it might be fine to stick you hand in the socket if you know what you are doing", which one is the more preferable one? 
And if you think that blanket advice is bad in general, I'd agree with you. But please take it up to the guy I was replying to. I was not posting a blanket advice just because, it was a reply to a seriously bad advice that starts the thread.
Please, don't get caught in semantic when posting, it's not productive
