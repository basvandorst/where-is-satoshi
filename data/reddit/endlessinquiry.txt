Things like meditation and mindfulness are great psychological supports, if that’s something you’re willing to play with.  Once you’re grounded and centered you will likely be able to handle difficult interactions better.  
Get your mind straight first, before you become too involved in other things and “just don’t have the time”.  
Seriously, self work is one of the most fulfilling things you can do in life, and it’s cheap enough that even poor people can afford it.  And with that said, dont waste your time at expensive, exclusive retreats.  After working on your issues, you will be more perceptive and more stable on the inside.  From there, it is likely that you will become more perceptive and clear about who you can trust and to what degree.
r/meditation is a place to dip your toe in.  But the truth is, you just can’t do mindfulness work on the internet.  Sure you can learn about stuff, but the proof is in the pudding, and ultimately you just need to practice. 
Good luck to you.  I hope you find inner peace.

Can someone explain to me why the neutrino acquisition is a big deal?  Do we have reason to believe that coinbase is going to do something shady now?

If living like a king means shitting in a pot, no heat or electricity, no internet, no glass for windows, no car or bicycle, no refrigerator, etc, then you have a very different idea of what living like a king means to me.

Obama used anti-Wall Street sentiment to win the election.  Then he filled his administration with wall street insiders.  I still cannot forgive him for that.

Did you read the series?  Back in the 70s we gave Iran the same type of printer we use.  Then the Shaw was removed and the new enemy state of Iran had this printer.

Buffet does not do speculative investment.  Period.  
He needs to be able to quantify the value of a company and its product.  
Can anyone quantify the value of bitcoin?
