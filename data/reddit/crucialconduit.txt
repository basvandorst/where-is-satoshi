Seems like you have to download the Factom client software and then paste the hash chain somewhere to access the content. Let us know of it is the real deal please!

Wtf...? I didn't think this was possible.

Provide me a detailed vision please. Provide real arguments instead of using positive woo. 
I am tired of all the misinformation and people talking without real experience.

Watch a fat frenchman embezzle millions of dollars and inflate the price of BTC with a fake money bot! Laughs ensue as he tries to distract everyone by building a Starbucks knockoff.

Not making fun of anyone, just being amused by other's ignorance, like I am with yours. Bitcoin has always had associated fees and has never been instant.

Yep. Fees for cc transactions are at least $0.10 per Visa and MC swipe...more for Amex swipes.
If the customers have to pay fees, this damages consumer incentives to use BTC. 
This why I doubt BTC can ever compete with real merchant processors and modern CC.

This is a fucking joke right?
Or purposely crafted misinformation.
Why the fuck would any customer use BTC for microtransactions when they have to pay tx fees? Or why would merchants wait forever for confirmations and be vulnerable to predatory antics?
Cue discussion about lightning networks and sidechain.
I think bitcoin is amazing to provide a robust alternative to the banking system, but cannot compete with modern CCs and merchant processors.

What good are transactions  without confirmations on the blockchain? Lol @ technicality vs. practical reality.

Lol .001 fee.
You ought have raised the transaction fees to avoid getting lost in the dust attack.
There is a stress test going on the Bitcoin network.

It is valued for being the most hard portable asset and an immutable unit of account. 
If BTC gets wide spread adoption from the supply chain (accepted by agribussiness, power companies, doctors, etc), BTC won't just be a hard asset but the most liquid currency ever in human history.
