Why are you holding fiat anyway? We must stop conforming to the system, period. Anything you really need will be available from somebody who will accept crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:14:23
I wasn't comparing bitcoin to other crypto, just to beanie babies and tulips.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:01:30
If you've been here longer, you should be able to put together better arguments.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:04:53
No a growing realisation of the price. There are plenty of real dollars out there, to be invested as adoption grows.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:36:54
So your brainwave is that all outcomes are equally probable?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:11:35
I'm sure that you realise that the only way to properly compare such drops in is terms of percentage changes and probabilities. A 90% drop is far, far less likely. Almost impossible now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:29:08
Nope. You're just looking at some numbers. You're money is just fine.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:11:42
So get a vendor who is less shortsighted. By all means get a dollar mortgage. It's great to have debt denominated in a currency that will eventually collapse.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:43:26
I was stupid not to buy when it was sub 300, and never thought I'd see 4 figures again. I won't make the mistake of missing out again. Bought two more coins just now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:55:01
They aren't meaningless...yet...but using them to suggest that you have lost money, is. Bitcoin is money, unless you forget your keys, you haven't lost that money.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:15:29
Yeah, it's all about time frames.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:24:53
Do you know what to do when there is blood in the streets? Three guesses.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:05:54
You did, it just wasn't a very good one.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:22:25
What's your previous comment based on?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:33:43
Two more guesses. :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:28:19
"How do you sleep at night?"..."On a big bed of money"
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:08:38
Remind me again how the supply of beanie babies (or tulips) was limited, how they could be transmitted worldwide in minutes, and when banks and governments started adopting them as a new paradigm.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:43:25
In dollars. Meaningless.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:21:01
Hopefully you understand bitcoin better than you understand gravity and black holes.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:38:47
Wider adoption is a much more likely explanation, and it will only grow in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:16:43
Very unlikely to have peaked. Still only a miniscule percentage of people have properly understood it, and even less have invested. The fact that everyone here knows people with exposure is just selection bias. Just wait until it common knowledge.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:02:59
It would not (unless you lose/sell your bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:13:23
Excellent response.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:17:44
Much less probable.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:42:40
Ah, the dollar pricing fallacy.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:56:01
Only in dollar terms. All my bitcoin are intact, and I have more than I had 24 hours ago.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:44:48
Dollar pricing fallacy.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:01:39
The same thing as last time. A growing realisation outside of early adopters that it has tremendous value. A 50% dip is meaningless (except it means that I can buy more).
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:04:04
You're the one that said three figures was closer. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:13:08
Not less money, no. I obviously wouldn't have less money. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:35:19
Not impossible. Just almost impossible.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:03:35
Only if the vendor is dumb. Find a smarter vendor.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:53:29
Worry? I'm too busy investing. This is the last time we'll see four figures. I'm not stupid enough to miss out again. I say thanks for the FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:56:44
The dip from 20k was just 50%. It would need a 90% drop to hit three figures. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:43:55
The fact that it is used as a currency means it's a currency. Sure, it may not fit with some out of date definitions, but that is because they are out of date.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:54:56
I agree, but I think it's by far the strongest contender. Along with the network effect and hash power, it is far more easy for bitcoin to absorb features from other crypto than for early start-ups to match competitors. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:20:58
I don't understand why writing a fairly straightforward app at 16 is considered that impressive anyway. Plenty of teenage developers, working without rich GUIs and tools, built far more impressive software back in the 80s. Matthew Smith wrote Manic Miner when he was 16.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:31:37
Absolute gold! But you'll never get the FUD brigade to admit it. They cling to their "conventional wisdom" even when this kind of evidence shows it to be nonsense. They'll still find a way to argue that evidence away. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:52:07
So, your point is that it is far too volatile for any company to accept, and also that Microsoft accepts it. You also feel that Microsoft is not a very big company, even though it is the third largest company in the world (by market cap). Excellent reasoning and solid research. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:11:02
Becoming mainstream. Becoming. Plenty of people accept it. Still a long way to go, which is why there is so much potential.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:16:25
Obviously you can. The fundamentals that you mention are only applicable to companies. Too narrow in this case. Presumably you've picked these up when reading about stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:00
No it isn't. Also bitcoin is not just a currency. Try again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:36:40
When you start by saying that no company would accept it, then name one that does, then say that the third largest company in the world is not very big, it's a bit hard to take your opinion seriously on more complex matters.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:35
It's not a case of throwing it out. The fact that you would even suggest that there is a underlying asset, shows that you do not understand the basics. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:37:54
So, only 8 years to dominance! Those companies went bust, bitcoin cannot go bust. So as I've always thought, we just need to play the waiting game.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:06:47
Anybody who tells you that they can determine the exact future value of anything is talking nonsense. That is not was investing is about.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:50:24
Already addressed. If it's used as a currency, then it's a currency. A rocket is still a means of transportation even if you can dig out and old text which says that transportation must include wheels, animal power and a driver.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:20:46
Correct! People need to stop looking for patterns in the price. The key is fundamentals, which are sound.  now. Crypto is becoming mainstream. There is a crypto tab on Marketwatch now. Bitcoin is too established to be displaced. Any features from competitors can be integrated far more easily than the competitor can gain the same foothold. I missed out sub 300 but am very heavily invested at 10k and very confident for the future.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:18:13
There you go! I knew it! Another one who thinks that currency fundamentals are the same as stock fundamentals. Not the same at all. Waste of time discussing if you think the price if a currency is tied to an underlying asset.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:18:49
Which currencies do you know of that have earning and profits?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:25:58
Far too narrow a definition. You are trying to define fundamentals as if bitcoin is a stock/company.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:30:44
Possibly. The point being that it is not really comparable to companies that can run out if money. If  the issue is survival until the new paradigm takes off, bitcoin can last as long as it takes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:09:36
It's not a currency just because I say it is. It is a currency because people use it as one. Applying a definition created by somebody who did not foresee crypto, doesn't change that fact.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:30:22
If you ask a hundred people, you'll get a hundred different answers. By the time the market eventually agrees on a value, it will be too late to invest.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:26:39
They've been repeated ad nauseum. They just don't match the stock fundamentals that you have read in Stocks for Dummies.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:59:44
Yes, it's volatile, and so relative demand is low. As the volatility reduces, so will demand. Given that it's a paradigm shift in currency, it's not surprising that it's volatile right now.
