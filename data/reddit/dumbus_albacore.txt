I sent mine to bittrex but it has been lost in space for about 30 minutes.  Any idea of this is normal?  
where coinbase asks, "are you sending this to a website?" i clicked "no" because...fuck them.

maybe someone can create a subreddit just for complaints about bitcoin memes

weird time to buy selling to buy lower if you ask me....

meh.  My third eye tells me it’s not going below 6000.  If all an exchange hack can do is drop it to current price I feel like this is the bottom.

How can you say “it’s more rare than gold”?  How are you quantifying that?  Something that is so insanely divisible, able to be transferred in such small amounts.  You can’t just be like 1 bitcoin = 2lbs of gold omggg there is so much more gold in the world.

jeez you have been waiting for that.  Third eye sees rebound to 6300 by tomorrow and then the end of the bear market.

literally.

yea but if you invest equally in winners and losers you gain nothing.  Might as well just put your money in a savings account.  
Vegas is fun.  Having all eggs in one basket is fun.  Especially if you believe.

kind of a newb question, what do you guys think the odds are that this makes BTC mining in the US profitable?
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:48:00
I imagined that I would put coin in my trezor and then keep it hidden away for years...       but it looks like I should probably periodically pull it out and update the firmware?

yeah maybe have one for deep storage and another for casual use?  It would freak me out to be carrying this thing around even though I know it can be restored.

If u never change to dollars do you avoid capital gains tax?
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:22:28
how did you “just remember”?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:48:52
It’s a hybrid of the two

Maybe it’s time I really kicked myself in the dick and started accepting btc at my business 
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:21:02
fuck.  Thanks for the info.  That seems like it would insanely complicate its future use as a currency.  Like if you’re just using bitcoin to pay rent...  every month you’ve got some insane different taxable event to calculate?
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:48:02
lol so true
