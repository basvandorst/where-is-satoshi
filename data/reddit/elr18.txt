How a bitcoin transaction  is "signed" without revealing the private key?

So, a little bit like how the public key is created, makes sense. but I still not understand how 2 key differently generated from different "one way formula" may be compared and validated when together. Also once you have the signature doesn't the private key become irrelevant? Does each transaction need a different signature? If so, how can each newly created signature may still validate with the original public key, and not giving up  a little bit more information about the original private key at each transaction, which could weaken your security after x transaction from the same address ?

The day the reward halve, if nothing else changes, for the same mining hash rate, you will only receive half the bitcoins of the day before. So each bitcoin mined is effectively twice as difficult to get compared to the day before. if this isn't bitcoin getting progressively more difficult to mine over time what it is
