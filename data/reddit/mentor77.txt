You think they overhauled the entire infrastructure and all security procedures in a few days?
Of course they didn't. They rebuilt the platform from *the same code* -- most of the time likely went towards migrating to AWS and tweaking the UI to add trading for their scamcoin. They don't understand the vulnerability that resulted in the hack, and the only reason bitcoin held there may be safe in the immediate term is that all withdrawals are being done manually. That situation is not sustainable. 
These guys have always been amateur hour. But this is a new level. Keep any funds there at your own peril. You have an opportunity to get out. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:22:20


They shouldn't be able to, because they can't offer any explanation for how they were compromised. By all appearances, they don't seem to know. The exploit used in the hack may very well still exist. Yet, people seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt. Crazy.

I've heard from a reliable source that Giancarlo said they had multiple interested investors, and at least one has offered to buy all debt for undisclosed equity (presumably all or most equity). Giancarlo apparently thinks the offer(s) undervalue the company. 
Giancarlo is apparently insane then. Why risk the potential repercussions of theft to socialize loss and issuing a debt-backed security? 
Take the deal, make customers whole, and walk away without going to prison. That's the best damn option you have, Bitfinex owners. And that option disappears once you issue these tokens and start trading again after enforcing the socialized loss. 
Accept the offer, make customers whole, and take your minority ownership and be happy.

Let's be real. No one is recovering the stolen coins. That's a joke and everyone knows it. No one is getting back 100%. 
You actually think Bitfinex will still be operating in 6 months? Daily volume considerably lower than BTC-E for another day... That's scary. They've removed cumulative bid/ask from Level 2 because lack of liquidity is fucking terrifying. Two weeks later they announce they still don't know how they were compromised, and they expect people to deposit funds? Meanwhile, Bitfinex hasn't even emailed customers informing them about the hack -- disgusting. I can only imagine how many account holders don't even know they were robbed. Bitfinex can't risk informing them now; more exodus of funds and more prospective lawsuits. 
Giancarlo and Raphael's unsurpassed retardness went too far this time. They thought they could do the impossible: recover $72 million with no capital infusion and nothing but hand-waving. Utter fucking retards. I hope they die in a grease fire.

Depends on the type of fee structure in the retainer. Given that this is a cutting edge legal area and a precedent-setting case, I wouldn't *completely* write off the idea of a firm taking this case on a contingency basis.

This is silly. Clearly this was not a security measure, as BitGo wallets were treated like hot wallets in which BitGo signed any transaction no matter what. 
The only purpose that it served was to individualize bitcoin wallets. And now Bitfinex has defeated that point as well by ignoring individualized losses and socializing them to all creditors.
You guys really aren't being consistent at all (legally or otherwise). Please re-consult with your counsel and other legal experts regarding the consequences of socializing losses (taking assets from unaffected users to pay for affected users).

Remember, Bitfinex's userbase is very valuable. Biggest USD exchange by volume. They are undoubtedly receiving offers to buy them out for pennies. I'm sure potential investors are offering them the minimum to make them solvent, requiring  all prior profits be disgorged.
Think about it. This is a drop in the bucket to save the userbase biggest USD exchange in the world. This is nothing like MT Gox, which was running a fractional reserve for years when Bitcoin was much less known. 
But it depends on Bitfinex's owners taking a big hit and giving up most/all equity and most/all profits. Hard bullet to bite, but YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO PRISON if you go the socialized losses route instead. Be smart here. 
And we should all be pushing them to take the buyout route. It sucks for them -- but they should be the losers here. Not customers. That's the damn point. Given profit disgorgement, $40-50 million is a drop in the bucket for a competing exchange to scoop up Bitfinex's userbase and grant themselves incredible goodwill in the bitcoin community. But the question is -- will Bitfinex owners take it? They fucking better. Or they are gonna go to prison.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:52:54
I'm sure you know that liquidating all compromised BTC balances to $ value is an option. A company buying Bitfinex out need only put up the USD equivalent. The question is whether equity holders are willing to give up the lions share of equity to those offering far less than Bitfinex was worth last week. 
A haircut opens up massive legal liability. Bitfinex's owners may need to bite the bullet here and sell out cheap if they want to avoid prison.
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:30:26
Crediting users with 31,327 BTC creates a 31,327 BTC liability. That has no relation to LTC ETC ETH USD holdings. I am talking specifically about BTC insolvency *only* since Bitfinex has hidden all accounting from us.

What is the reasoning behind that? The sooner you get trading on-line, the more likely you can prevent at least a portion of the exodus from Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:20:44


This is the standard for *conviction*. Any criminal investigations are likely early in the going. Proving the case would involve a forensic analysis of Bitfinex's books, known assets, banking and blockchain activities. The fact that Bitfinex has attempted to hide all information about their assets from us does not absolve them of any crimes committed. 
If bitcoin is property/a commodity, then bitcoins held -- particularly those held in segregated customer wallets (like safety deposit boxes) -- by Bitfinex are part of a bailor/bailee relationship with the depositing customer. When the hacked bitcoins were stolen, Bitfinex's mere custody over customer funds does not authorize them to commit theft nor embezzlement to redistribute those funds to themselves and other customers. Illegal asset conversion can be either civil or criminal, but larceny and embezzlement are criminal matters. Issuing a debt security without proper licensing is also criminal in many jurisdictions, including the US. So that's another can of worms.
No one can be expected to have the evidence now, a week or so after the hack. Most of the evidence is in Bitfinex's hands, or their banks'. But I will say, everything about this smells of fraud --
A cursory glance at their known assets makes it clear that the 36% amount is far too high. Bitfinex either paid certain large account holders in full to prevent lawsuits, converted customer funds into their own funds, are covering some undisclosed liability (like Synapse Pay refunding its customers 100% in spite of Bitfinex's attempts to haircut them), or some combination of these: 
They should also be holding a lot more BTC, considering how much they refunded to customers following the hack. If they can't prove control over these funds, they are likely BTC-insolvent (if not completely insolvent) and are committing fraud: 


I have no doubt that people are doing exactly this. However, they may not need to pony up any cash. IMO, some firms would litigate this on a contingency basis, particularly because this is a cutting edge legal space and precedent-setting case. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:19:02
There are reports that the massive drop of 127k BTC from P2SH addresses = the Bitfinex theft. Can you confirm or deny?
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:51:45
The problem with this line of thinking is that it assumes that all people have the same incentives. From a rational (if selfish) standpoint, anyone who has already withdrawn all available funds from Bitfinex is incentivized to legally pursue Bitfinex for anything they can. They have nothing to lose. 
So you can't assume people won't sue Bitfinex and/or complain to law enforcement agencies. They simply will (and have). And frankly, I bet a lot of people want blood. And they don't give a shit about recovering anything -- they just want to burn Bitfinex to the ground.
I agree -- this sucks for people with frozen accounts. But it's just reality. It also sucks for all account holders who haven't logged in since the hack; Bitfinex has never emailed its customers about the hack. Many are not aware they have lost funds, I am sure. Of any groups of Bitfinex customers, they will bear the worst of losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:05:43

You are aware that we didn't sign up for socialized losses, correct? This is not legal in the US.

You're right. We should all just lie down quietly and never again mention Bitfinex losing 120k BTC and trying to operate as if nothing happened, after taking 36% of customer funds without their knowledge or consent.

Because their ETH wallet is public and held $10-11 million in ETH at time of hack.
As I said, only speaking to BTC, since we only have blockchain evidence to go on. Even if they are currently solvent, being BTC-insolvent can become a major problem if BTC rallies.

The borrower pays with the borrowed USD, and returns it when position is closed. During the time the position is open, the USD is lent to the borrower. 
That means that $38,000,000 borrowed is a $38,000,000 liability to USD lenders. The maintenance margin required (likely held in BTC) is irrelevant. That $38,000,000 should have been on deposit with Bitfinex's banks, regardless of the borrower's margin.

@_date: 2016-08-03 09:51:41
Earlier you dismissed negligence on the part of BitGo. But doesn't the fact that 120k BTC were leaked before BitGo stopped auto-signing tx suggest that they did not comply with Bitfinex's limits? It seems their fraud prevention is virtually non-existent, with no heuristics to trigger manual verification of withdrawals. 
Does Bitfinex have an agreement with BitGo wherein the latter vets transactions signed by the former? If not, what is the point in using multi-sig at all?--that effectively means all user funds are held in a hot wallet, since the 2nd signer would sign any transaction signed by the 1st, no matter what.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:01:20

65,907 BTC
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:20:17


Bitfinex lost 119,756 BTC. Of this, they credited back to customers 31,327 BTC. We can see on the blockchain the theft of 119,756 BTC from Bitfinex's wallets. We cannot see 31,327 BTC returning to their wallets. 


This is not a false assumption. Please re-read Bitfinex's announcements, as well as the reports of many users who were holding BTC pre-hack only to have it credited back to them post-hack. For those affected by the hack (lost BTC), Bitfinex did not issue USD or other assets in the place of lost BTC. 


I did not mention other assets which may or may not have been sold to recoup the BTC. They certainly may have sold these assets -- but that doesn't erase the 31,327 BTC in liabilities from their book. Those BTC should be under Bitfinex's control, visible on the blockchain, since they are customer deposits.


The fact is that Bitfinex credited BTC holders with BTC -- not with USD, LTC, ETC, ETH. That means that the lost BTC appeared out of thin air on their platform, without being seen in Bitfinex's wallets. Whether or not Bitfinex actually controls that BTC, it is on their books as liabilities. 
**Alice was holding 10 BTC on Bitfinex when Bitfinex was hacked. Alice's BitGo wallet was hacked, then held 0 BTC. When Bitfinex relaunched, Alice was holding 6.3933 BTC. Where did that BTC come from? If Bitfinex sold USD to get that BTC, that BTC should be in Bitfinex's wallets. But it's not. And it never was.**


Whether they sold USD, LTC, ETH, ETC to recover the bitcoin -- we don't know. But *if they did*, they should be able to show control over the BTC they bought. 
The only other public wallet I know of is Bitfinex's ETH wallet; they only removed 24,000 ETH between hack and relaunch (&lt; 500 BTC), so that certainly wouldn't cover the lost bitcoins.

There aren't even any concrete repayment terms. The tokens do not convert to equity. Bitfinex has stated that they "have not disclosed the total outstanding tokens" which suggests they may even dilute them beyond the originally stated loss.

You conveniently ignore how more than half of Bitfinex's cold storage was withdrawn from the site. Clearly the first several days of trading volume were fueled by traders exiting the exchange via BTC withdrawal.

Limited liability goes in the trash if the company is undercapitalized, among other things. The corporate veil can be pierced for various reasons. 
More importantly, limited liability does not protect you from criminal activity. Fraudulent conversion of assets is a criminal matter, in addition to civil damages.

Agree, not theft (although in spirit, I think it is). The element that may be missing for criminal conversion is intent to defraud. What, in your opinion, might constitute fraudulent conversion given the facts here? What could establish that the owners willfully and knowingly took the property wrongfully -- nothing less than proof that Bitfinex pulled an inside job, then converted customer assets to cover the theft?  
Here's the sticking point for me: We can only speculate -- there is no evidence. Do they intend to repay the debt, and did they at the time of conversion? It is not clear that they intend to pay it in a reasonable amount of time -- they state they may not be able to pay it at all. I've been listening to Giancarlo, Raphael and Phil for years now -- these guys are the scum of the earth. I would *love* to get a look at their books/assets and truly know whether they are remotely solvent (without even considering the BFX token liabilities). For all we know, shareholders ransacked the company, and it's a skeleton. 


I agree that a tort case can be made there. Just speculating on whether any US agencies will investigate. The debt security is the most interesting thing there anyway.

Perhaps that was based on the statement that BitGo's servers were not compromised. However, I'm not sure that this absolves BitGo of negligence. We don't know  what limits/triggers for manual review BitGo was supposed to enforce. If there were any, clearly BitGo ignored them.

My hope is to get enough people talking about this that Bitfinex cannot reasonably ignore it. 


If the community pushes them, and they can prove they are BTC-solvent, they will definitely do so. If they refuse in the face of questioning from the community, well, this will hopefully trigger a continuation of the exodus from their platform.

Just please, take any offer you get. Give up majority equity/control and give back most of your past profits and we can all walk away from this unscathed. 
The generalized socialized loss is a terrible idea legally, so I am praying you have something else up your sleeve, Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:57:45
There is a way back from this. But not if you socialize losses. If you socialize losses, the US government will shut you down...there is no question. 
Customers and Bitfinex have a bailor/bailee relationship. What's lost is lost. You need to repay the rest to its rightful owners. This is the only legal defensible position. 
Bitfinex is not a bankruptcy trustee and cannot act as its own trustee/liquidator.
You need to take the lost assets off your books to retain solvency, and you need to make your bailments currently held available to their rightful owners. We all know the bitcoins are lost. Trying to convert those losses to steal from other customers is going to get Bitfinex SHUT DOWN. Please consult with some more legal experts -- specifically those who are experienced with US law. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:27:01

@_date: 2016-08-07 01:08:06
This isn't bankruptcy -- that's the point. 
Clearly they are taking the position that they can remove lost assets from the books to retain solvency. But that is only true if customer assets are bailments. If that is true, and we know the stolen assets to have been segregated and tied to specific customers, then those assets are considered lost and unrecoverable. To then take from unaffected customers is theft. This is comparable to theft of assets held in bank deposit boxes.

That was a possibility before Bitfinex implemented the socialized loss and securitized a debt token. Now they have incurred huge exposure to legal risk. No investor will touch them now.

@_date: 2016-08-06 23:59:41


Bitcoins on deposit are bailments, particularly because they are in segregated addresses per customer. This is similar to a bank deposit box. See: 
Taking USD from my account to pay for someone else's lost bailments is theft. They have no authority to convert *my* assets for that purpose, which they have no ownership over. 


By last account, they are already insolvent. The common law remedy is to remove the lost bailments (lost bitcoins) from their books based on the customers they were assigned to, thereby remedying the insolvency.

What they have told us--They rebuilt the platform, servers, wallets and workplaces. Whoop-de-fucking-do. That was supposed to make us feel secure. Yet it wouldn't address the problem. 


The only reason that works is that the exchange is dead. If they were to return to previous volumes, they would need to automate withdrawals. They can't endlessly hire humans to process bitcoin withdrawals.


No argument there. Too bad BitGo auto-signed all 120k in stolen BTC with hot keys. Oh yeah, Bitfinex is still working with BitGo.


People were bragging about wiring money into Gox in the last days before they shut down. Something about buying cheap coins.

Please run this by the management team again. As someone who will be keeping a portion of funds on-site to make the market, I urge Bitfinex to re-open trading at the same time as withdrawals to prevent a full-on exodus.

In other words, your plan assumes that no other customers are going to pursue legal remedies, and that no law enforcement agencies are investigating Bitfinex for criminal behavior (theft, fraudulent asset conversion). 
**You can get 33 cents on the dollar for the BFX token right now. And you can sue to recover anything above that.** Riding it out assumes that Bitfinex is safe from legal fallout. I find that extremely unlikely. 
All it will take is a couple bank account seizures to completely ruin Bitfinex. Never mind the US Attorney/FBI seizing bitfinex.com. This all assumes that Bitfinex is even secure from being hacked again -- highly unlikely since they don't know how they were compromised.

Um, Bitfinex literally stole customer funds held in its custody. Depending on the exact circumstances, this constitutes either larceny or embezzlement. Illegal conversion can be both a civil or criminal matter. They are also committing securities fraud by issuing debt securities unlicensed (which are likely illegal not simply because they are unregistered, but because the liabilities incurred by them by definition make the company insolvent).

Anyone looking to sue has got work cut out for them, and by the time any assets are frozen, most will be gone. Then come years of court/legal fees. And then you're at the back of the line for payouts. So you're looking for 10% back 3-5 years later? If you're lucky. Yikes.

You're providing nothing but FUD about a hub and spoke model. It *may* look that way, particularly as businesses try to bootstrap the system at inception, but that's not the intention nor is your case well evidenced. Routing networks could initially depend on major transmitters like Coinbase, but if the protocol is adopted, there are real incentives to both transact and relay LN tx for everyone on the Bitcoin network. In the worst case scenario, if a "hub" attempts to censor tx and no one is willing to route, ever, the channel will be closed at time lock expiration and funds returned to owners.
Consider the alternatives. If we endlessly allow main chain throughput ahead of technology and code improvement, we pressure nodes off the network and make censorship via Sybil attack easier. Or Coinbase as a wallet, rather than having trustless control of your money. If we depend on a centralized node network and trusted third parties, the system is highly censorable. Bigger blocks also exacerbates mining centralization and will drive mining further behind China's GFW, making regulation of higher proportions of miners possible at any given time.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:49:18

The point is that in engineering, you plan for worst case scenarios. You don't plan for only the best case scenario (endless infrastructure improvement that outpaces demand + no infrastructure disasters, ever), as Gavin does, with nothing more than the claim that "technology gets better." We are working towards solutions that don't require unrealistic technological expectations, guaranteed mass adoption and perpetual rise in price (the latter two are required in the case of no fee market). None of those things are guaranteed. So we should not rely on them.
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:27:38
I think you are correct, overlooked this. Will double check and update the OP.
We know that no significant amount was deposited after the funds were swept, or after the haircut announcement. So we can be fairly sure no funds were added to account for the shortfall from buying OTC, etc.
I am still of the opinion that if they can't prove control over the addresses that hold/held the recovered amounts, that we should assume insolvency. Indeed we don't know how much was customer vs. company funds, but we know they incurred a significant liability. Phil Potter said they held 10% or so as company reserves. Even if this all came from BTC assets (would never happen), that leaves nearly 30k BTC unaccounted for.
@_date: 2016-04-15 06:07:14
Evidence, please. This is just baseless FUD. So, blocks approaching capacity is killing adoption? Is that why the price of BTC is up 95% year over year, and eclipses all other crypto markets? Right. 
Alts are great as testnets that can implement features that could later be incorporated into bitcoin. They are not competition. Certainly not to be "digital gold." Most new alt coins don't even have a value proposition comparable to bitcoin; they merely introduce new use cases without retaining bitcoin's value proposition (limited supply, immutable consensus, POW security). Bitcoin isn't dependent on new use cases; it has no real competition yet as a store of value and trustless, widespread payment network. And if someday a real contender for "digital gold" does emerge to compete with bitcoin, I say, so it goes. We are here and ready to embrace it.

Bitfinex is a black cloud over BTCUSD price. Previously, they were simply incompetent -- regular downtime/outages, buggy order matching. By socializing loss of customer funds and issuing a debt security, they have exposed themselves to massive legal risk (both criminal and civil). 
On top of it, they've made it clear that they don't understand how they were compromised -- otherwise they'd have done far more than simply rebuild their platform from the existing code. They are manually processing withdrawals because they know that automating the process exposes them to the same attack vector.
They are at risk to be shut down by law enforcement and sued into the ground by customers. Their pathetic volume has only been fueled by the exodus of customers leaving; liquidity and volume are now a complete joke. Bitfinex has now hidden the cumulative bid/ask on Level 2 because they obviously see how scary their lack of liquidity is. 


I'm sure their plan was that this would instill confidence in the market. A long shot to think this would be enough to save their flailing, insolvent exchange.

I only have USD on there as well. But we need to face the facts. Our longshot miracle is an investor re-capitalizes BFX. If that doesn't happen, they will enter bankruptcy and pool creditor assets. 
Allowing withdrawal during insolvency is very, very illegal.

For that to be true, they would need to recover the losses.

That's fairly simple. Whether you are "in the business of" something is not a new concept. Hobbyists generally don't apply. Eventually (years down the road), there *could* be regulation or precedent set that defines specifically what constitutes being in the business of transmitting Lightning transactions. That's a long shot, but even if this were to happen, those "centralized hubs" (as detractors like to assume the existence of) that are indeed in the business of transmitting money, are likely to register. Those that aren't, won't, and those that don't want to, won't. And pursuing LN node operators without any real business presence in the US, across US borders, I think, would prove extremely difficult and pointless for US law enforcement, as an example. Either way, no matter what, LN funds are safe, and worst-case scenario, time-locked funds are returned to their owners. 


How can they be more easily written to regulate users of LN than users of bitcoin? How can transactions be censored? At worst, they will be refunded at timelock expiration. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:26:31


Keep in mind, this has the same problem as Ripple's pre-mined XRP market cap. The entire supply of BFX is pre-mined, but very little of the supply appears to be liquid. How useful is market cap as a metric? In any case, the question is how much fees BFX trading can generate vs. Bitfinex's $72mm + in un-backed liabilities. Call me cynical, but issuing a shitcoin which is being traded at low volumes doesn't look like it will be a boon.

Actually, no. Coinbase is already widely used as a wallet; they incentivise users to do so by paying their miner fees and offering free transactions among Coinbase users and merchants. It's not unreasonable to suggest LN as an alternative to this sort of reckless behavior.
On node centralization:  
On miner centralization: 


That's your claim, and I don't find it compelling, particularly when you can provide nothing to support it. In the early goings of the Bitcoin network, one could have said the very same thing. Time will tell, but in the meantime, the worst case scenario if payments cannot be routed is that timelock expiration allows a sender to recoup their money. 


Yes, quite like the vast majority of blockchain commerce being processed through Bitpay and Coinbase. 


I don't think Core has been unreasonable at all, especially considering how large and diverse of a group it is. And I'm tired of entertaining this bullshit, tbh. Nobody is forcing LN on anybody, least of all Core. They have been tirelessly optimizing bandwidth, storage and processing requirements for nodes (see libsecp256k1, blocksonly, maxuploadtarget, pruned Core wallet) -- the basis for multiple objections to larger block size -- while laying the groundwork for both onchain and offchain scaling (Segwit opens doors for LN, Schnorr signatures, using key recovery to shrink signature sizes, supporting sidechains). 
Many people already dug their trenches and shut down rational discussion last year. Gavin Andresen and Brian Armstrong (both employed by Coinbase) included. Frankly, I think some people (at least those who aren't already zealots) mistake the forthrightness and intelligence of people like Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd and Luke Dashjr for something more malicious. If one does their research on the issues (latency, bandwidth, and node/miner centralization), I think it becomes very clear who is worth listening to in this debate.  And who is really interested in honest discussion. And who even runs a damn node (as opposed to paying classic-cloud to spin a few up for them). 
@_date: 2016-04-18 21:04:29


No, I'm not. The challenges to Bitcoin scalability have been discussed for several years now. 


One could argue we needed this decades ago. What's your point? You're projecting external standards onto Bitcoin that have no relevance to its limitations or viability as a p2p network. Bitcoin's maximum current on-chain limitations for block size are in the 3-4MB realm (this is accepted by both XT developers, Core developers, academics). At the very maximum, that likely puts throughput at &lt;20 transactions/second. Not exactly Visa. So what are you suggesting? Whether we increase the block size or not, it is simply impossible to endlessly allow more throughput on the main chain while expecting fees not to rise.


I disagree. I think it would have been preferable to have a smaller block size limit initially to emphasize p2p network health and miner decentralization over free transactions. "Safe" scaling options actually contribute to scalability by increasing throughput without degrading network performance. Segwit does so by allowing low-capacity nodes to continue participating with limited bandwidth. Schnorr signatures will do so by limiting signature size, directly improving scale. Lightning Network will do so by mitigating the need for on-chain commitment, directly improving scale. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:18:57
The starting point for your explanation is that "they hacked his Finex account." No, we don't know that. 
If they were running such scripts for thousands of financial services, why was he contacted by *only one* -- and *one which he already does business with, and who has all his contact information?*
It's not clear, but it sounds like his mutual fund company is sending 2FA authentications for his accounts held with them. Again, what does that have to do with Bitfinex?
What evidence is there that this has anything to do with Bitfinex?
@_date: 2016-04-19 00:13:37


I agree. Apply your logic to Coinbase's agenda.


If you read the paper, you see that this considerably drops after 4MB. That's why they stated 4MB as a theoretical maximum. This also assumes that we are okay with forcing 10% of nodes off the network. 
In the same vein, the authors only contemplate the capacity for fully validating nodes to operate at scale. Whether operators of fully validating nodes will do so given increased bandwidth requirements is not clear, and requires a thorough game theory analysis. This is a matter of human incentive, not theoretical limits, as decentralization requires humans to make a conscious decision to run a node. We cannot presume that humans will do so if our target for throughput capacity is to use all bandwidth that node operators have access to in order to run a node.
As a node operator I can tell you: we will never, ever devote all of our bandwidth resources to running a node. We will shut down our node instead. I believe this is a dangerous assumption for the authors to make:


The authors concede that they do not analyze metrics that affect, for example, mining distribution—missing from their analysis is the effect on mining centralization, particularly in China. It is a common misconception that the GFW restricts Chinese miners. Rather, the majority of hash power being inside the GFW means that Chinese miners are at a great advantage. Since the p2p network outside of the GFW is delayed in receiving blocks from Chinese miners, the majority of hash power within the GFW is not, ensuring that Chinese miners are better insulated from orphan risk than the rest of the world. This problem is exacerbated by larger block size, as propagation times inevitably increase across the network. Pieter Wuille’s simulator, without such regional considerations, comes to similar conclusions: larger block sizes mean decreased profitability for smaller miners, adding centralization pressures. 
Also, keep in mind that the authors conclude that the bitcoin protocol must fundamentally be redesigned for its blockchain to achieve significant scale while retaining decentralization. 


The efficacy of said improvements remains to be seen. More importantly, this point goes both ways -- the results were based on a limited number of possible metrics and the authors suggest that they should be viewed as “upper bounds” (best case scenario) and not necessarily as the real limits of the network, which could be significantly lower. A proper engineering plan should be based on “lower bounds”—never best case scenarios—to ensure maximum inclusivity, connectivity and robustness among peers.


People often make these reductions ("fancy" "hacks" = bad). The mechanism is a simple flex block cap. There is nothing particularly complicated about it; wallet developers and library maintainers have widely said Segwit is highly supportable. 


Sorry, but that's not clear at all. As a node operator, I am not interested in increasing the block size at all. I'd even prefer that we implement a decreased block size, but since that change would be contentious, there is no point discussing it (Gavin should take a queue from us small blockers, there). I would prefer that users pay increasing fees to compensate for the miner security that their transactions receive. Myself included. 


It hasn't been done because there is no agreement in the community to change consensus rules. Bitcoin's very value is derived from the immutability of its consensus. If its rules could easily be changed (whether by a majority, or less), the majority can simply steal from the minority (whether through inflation or otherwise)

Meanwhile, nothing has happened over that time besides 1) Core adding fantastic bandwidth optimizations and laying the groundwork for Lightning Network, and 2) the price of bitcoin nearly doubling.

True, but if you look at their average daily volume, it isn't diverging. Bitfinex's volume has dropped into the abyss. The issue isn't BTC-E gaining volumes; it's that Bitfinex lost it. 


Liquidity never returned to Bitstamp. Traders have called it a ghost exchange for well over a year. Bitfinex will hold that title if the owners are very lucky. 


No, that's not necessarily true at all. The bigger indicator that traders are leaving is that 57% of Bitfinex's BTC has been withdrawn.

Nonsense. Consensus among participants is the only thing that enables a cohesive global ledger (the bitcoin blockchain). That doesn't change the fact that the consensus rules were centrally planned. 
Also, bitcoin arguably hard forked in 2013 because a previously invalid block (rejected by pre-0.8 nodes) was mined and considered valid by 0.8 nodes.

You're missing the point. By writing and running the code, he created the currency and set the inflation mechanism. Whatever happens in the future, we have thus far, maintained these consensus rules which Satoshi set in place. This is central planning in action.

Layer 1 does not compete with Layer 2. The latter exists because of the weaknesses of Layer 1--it is a massive required redundancy broadcast network (broadcast networks are already accepted as ultimately not scalable, hence our dependence on additional layers on top of IPv4 for data reliability and integrity)... Layer 2, of course, cannot exist without Layer 1, so your arguments are sort of missing the point. 
This "central planning" meme is just adorable. You know who was a central planner? Satoshi. He coded the 21 million coin cap with controlled inflation. The very premise of Bitcoin security--balancing incentives of different parties to ensure honest market actors (vs double spend attacks) is based in "central planning." You cannot remove "planning" from engineering--as much as Gavin would like to. Please remember that Bitcoin is not merely money, but also the engineering project that created and must maintain the viability of that money. Satoshi himself said that creating Bitcoin was much more about *design* than coding. I agree. I think the "central planning" meme is a cheap and dishonest attempt to rile up Libertarians and ancaps (common affiliations that bitcoiners have) against the [pinko commie?] "central planning" developers. 
I could see how one's ignorance of bitcoin's premises, or of basic engineering procedure, might lead him to believe that nonsense, though. Hence why I think you should stop pushing this red herring. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 06:26:52


The premise is sound and the code is being tested. What are you suggesting?


Bitcoin is centrally planned, like any engineering project. Satoshi was the biggest central planner of all, creating 21 million BTC through controlled inflation. Bitcoin is not merely money, but a meticulously maintained engineering project that attempts to balance human incentives while maintaining peer-to-peer and trustless qualities. If you are looking for "free market" to mean "disregarding all technical knowledge and logic" then I believe you are in the wrong place.
Satoshi also implemented payment channels in the original software, as well as the ability for validation of non-standard scripts, to precisely add features that were not ready at the time. Nothing mentioned is at odds with the original design of bitcoin, nor the accepted definition of bitcoin as a trustless p2p payment system. 


And this is confusing....why?


Sorry, but no. I've rebutted your claims on this before, and there is no comparison to SPV nodes. Non-Segwit nodes do not provide Segwit addresses to payers. They don't need to validate Segwit tx and can fully validate any payments they receive.


Firstly, source? You're not even contemplating miners here -- why would the network then partition when there is no consensus-critical validation issue for nodes?


What were you expecting? The original purpose of Segwit was never to increase capacity. It was to fix malleability and allow for more sophisticated contracts. I don't see any urgency for increased blocksize--I'd prefer more block scarcity, particularly as time goes on. Consider that 75% increase (considerably more in the adversarial case) as throwing a bone to you forkers. 


It doesn't require anything. It's an option offered to those that want cheaper fees, that don't need their transactions published to the blockchain. This sounds quite attractive, and I think it will therefore be widely adopted. But bitcoin will function perfectly well, as it always has, if not. 


As opposed to locking money up in a hot wallet for regular spending? Or in a cold wallet which makes spending inconvenient? 
In either case, users can be gamed by the very same spam attacks, which will make their transactions uneconomical to push. I mean, what's the comparison, here? The only difference here is that in between a channel opening and closing, participants may be able to transact significantly cheaper (for LN nodes, there is no overhead barrier as in the mining sector, and a free market for fees -- which are only for hops, don't require being published in a block nor relayed to every node in the network) 


In your scenario -- you are a supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, correct? -- the network remaining as decentralized as now requires that technology perpetually outpace demand for block space. Not only that, but it also assumes that improvements will be uniformly accessible; they won't be. 
In my scenario -- retaining smaller block size for as long as possible while focusing on off-chain scaling -- p2p node health, and that of miners outside of the GFW, are preserved comfortably below expectations of technological or code improvement. 
The cost of a confirmed transaction is more than $1, and as much as $6, according to the recent IC3/Cornell/et al study. That cost is significantly subsidized *for the moment* by block reward subsidy. But coins are nearly 75% mined already, and subsidy will halve again shortly (and fairly quickly, again, and again)... as that subsidy drops, if fees don't begin to replace them, the proof-of-work security of the network will degrade as miners shut down. This is *already* in the context of increased incentive to double spend attack as reward (block reward) drops vs. risk (cost incurred from failed attack). 
A fee market -- which coincides with network limitations -- that can begin to replace block subsidy is a much more long term sustainable solution than what you suggest. Increasing the cap on block size (apart from the centralization pressure on nodes and miners) depends on perpetually rising transaction usage to pressure fees away from free. If not, this scenario depends on bitcoin rising to the moon, always and forever, for miner revenues to compete with the fiat overhead of mining. 
Removing the cap can't guarantee transaction fee rewards for miners at all -- to guarantee fee income, miners would have to *in perpetuity* agree on a soft limit to enforce among all miners on the network. I'd argue that this may be impossible to achieve much of the time. But if it isn't, we constantly risk partitioning the network as miners disagree on what constitutes a valid block. Same goes for any nodes whose operators decide to throttle the block size they will accept. 
As you can see, my scenario doesn't depend on anything you claim. It is *at least* better than any roadmap that depends primarily on endless, fast technological improvements and a rising bitcoin price.

Anyonecanspend is an *output* type, not an input type. The anyonecanspend output does not affect the input. If I take any UTXO and use it as my input, I have to spend it as the output dictates. The *output* can be anyonecanspend, but that doesn't affect how the inputs of the transaction are validated. 
So if the output says that it needs a signature in the 
scriptsig (e.g. a P2PK output), then it needs a signature in the scriptsig regardless of Segwit. Since non-Segwit nodes do not generate, say, P2WPKH addresses, they can fully validate any spends they receive. And they still validate the transaction data of Segwit transactions.
Now, you are correct that non-Segwit nodes do not *fully* validate Segwit transactions. They *do* validate the transaction data of Segwit transactions (minus the witness) -- hence the ability to maintain a single global consensus ledger with Segwit nodes. So it is inaccurate to say they do not validate Segwit transactions. As stated, this does not affect non-Segwit nodes, since they do not need witness data to validate spends that are relevant to them. 
The only problem posed is in bootstrapping the Segwit p2p network during deployment. Since Segwit nodes require witness data which old nodes do not relay, old nodes cannot bootstrap Segwit nodes. A partition is theoretically possible, not because of consensus-critical issues, but p2p routing issues. However, we could implement a new service bit (say, NODE_SEGWIT), so outgoing peers can be instructed only to connect to peers with Segwit support. (Actually, now that I am looking, it seems the NODE_WITNESS service bit was already merged!) As long as we can swap non-Segwit peers for Segwit peers in outgoing connections, we should be able to avoid any theoretical partition due to bootstrapping weakness.
Interestingly, Peter Todd points out that this weakness already exists in the current Bitcoin protocol: since neither addrman nor the outgoing connection thread takes what service bits a peer advertises into account, if a large number of non-block-relaying nodes joined the network and advertised their addresses, the network could partition even without an explicit attack.

Segwit isn't a direct answer to scalability; it is not an answer to the question of throughput capacity. Segwit is a response to transaction malleability, which prevents the existence of scaling solutions like the Lightning Network. It's scripting capabilities will allow for many new features (including some, like Schnorr signatures, that will directly improve scale).

Depends on the userbase, and the economic wealth behind nodes that choose one fork or the other.

Trouble is, market cap is temporary. Just like where miners point hashpower is temporary. Just like short-term spikes in nodes may be temporary. There are no easy answers here. And the quickest answer the market gives may very well be *wrong* in the longer term. What if a majority of miners fork to 2MB, only later to find that most of the userbase forked them off? The vast majority of hashpower would be building the longest chain (validity aside) on a network that is ignored by most users. Price discovery is very slow -- it could take days or weeks (assuming exchanges even have their act together to differentiate for users which chain their coins are valid on) for the difference in valuation to become clear. Exchanges have even bigger problems, because sending customers "bitcoins" that are invalid on the original network could open themselves up to fraud lawsuits. All of this is very unclear, and any contention that the market will quickly decide is not well-founded.

Consensus as in "protocol consensus." General agreement among nodes on the rules. 
Segwit doesn't actually change the protocol's consensus rules, but presumably it will not be activated without consensus. Historically, activation consensus for soft forks has been at 95%. Regardless, Segwit has far more agreement among the community, including miners; even Classic developers agree that its functionality is much needed. Further, it is backwards compatible, meaning those that do not want to upgrade aren't forked off the network against their will. Further, unlike BIP101 or other block size increase BIPs, Segwit was the only proposal for throughput capacity increase that achieved widespread agreement among Core developers. 
It's not contentious at all. And even if it were, at least it doesn't threaten to fork anyone that disagrees off the network, like a 2MB hard fork does.

How is it a contentious soft fork if no fork occurs until *after* consensus is reached? That's the purpose of the consensus mechanism -- to enforce the status quo until consensus is reached on a new rule set.
That's why Core has continually asked Classic to raise the activation threshold to 95% or better ... like all past intentional forks that waited for consensus. Waiting for consensus =/= contentious. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 02:57:57


That could happen for any reason, regardless of a code fork. That has nothing to do with Core developers contributing to an open source project. 
The fact is that many viewed XT and Classic as hostile takeovers pushing agendas they wanted nothing to do with. Core can't stop those people from DDOSing pools. That is not a function of Core's role and they cannot be blamed for it. If pools can't withstand DDOS attacks, it's really not Core's fault. And it certainly doesn't imply that they have "control" over the protocol.


You can say that, but it's not the impression I got. I recall on the Bitcoin Discussion forum, a handful of posters plastered XT and Classic threads all over upon their respective releases, clearly pushing an agenda. I don't have any problem moderating them. I can tell you that I don't even go to r/btc anymore because every post I make there is immediately downvoted to hell. And on r/btc, I get quite the opposite impression. 
Frankly there is no such thing as censorship in a privately owned venue. But in any case, the fact that this is raised as an excuse at all implies that there really wasn't overwhelming support for XT or Classic to begin with. (Eg. Why are Classic nodes being spun up, rather than Core nodes switching?) One thing we know about pseudonymous social networks is that they are extremely easy to Sybil attack. It's very easy to spin up a boatload of names with similar opinions. Is it okay to do so? Wasn't Olivier Janssens recently caught using sockpuppets on r/btc? Would you not expect backlash against such behavior? 
The bottom line re: censorship -- Core doesn't control Theymos any more than Classic controls the army of muppets that downvote every word I say on r/btc. We need to accept that and move on to whats important: debating the merit of code.


Sure. Just like Olivier Janssens summarily overriding and closing one of Jeff Garzik's pull requests on the Classic github. :P
To be honest, programming is and should be a centralized, meritocratic process. That's how engineering works. If just any coder could add just anything they want to the production-ready client that bitcoin users are downloading everyday -- that would be disastrous. The vast majority of programming is debugging; most work shouldn't simply be merged into the codebase -- certainly not as it was originally written. 
The fact is that Gavin and Hearn (and to a lesser extent Garzik, who isn't nearly as gung ho for big blocks) were in a small minority among developers. That the vast majority of developers (technical experts) disagreed with their ideas should be justification enough not to implement it in Core. As such, they were free to fork the code, any they did. 
I just don't see how any of this is very important. I can't imagine how it's more important than the question of node centralization. It's either open source, or it's not. It's pretty open and shut.
@_date: 2016-03-23 20:39:28


No, it seems you are very confused about how networks operate. Those 99% of nodes are the vast majority of the network, and any "important businesses" (like exchanges) are entirely dependent on that network to remain relevant. 
Here are several posts describing why non-mining nodes are essential to network security, and to the definition of bitcoin as a p2p/decentralized network:
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:03:10


No, I'm not. Block size is directly related to bandwidth requirements for nodes. All else equal, increased block size = increased upload bandwidth used. I know, because I have shut down nodes or throttled maxconnections specifically to avoid overusing limited bandwidth.
Is the data opaque? Yes. Do we know the motivation for every action that every node operator takes? No. There is no "proof" or "law" in economics for this reason. That doesn't mean we can ignore the direct relationship between block size and bandwidth requirements and the negative correlation between operating nodes and average block size.
Similarly, there's no proof that taxes are a cause of black market activity. If I asserted that they were, you could say I am confusing correlation with causation. Again, I am not. The fact that causal proof is impossible is not evidence against causation. It is not sufficient to ignore sound logic and data that do support the case for causation.


I have run nodes for almost 4 years, and I didn't do it merely to validate my transactions, but to do my part in keeping the system robust. It isn't out of altruism; it is because I am/was heavily invested in Bitcoin. It was purely out of rational self-interest. It's less about being attacked personally (e.g. by running an SPV node), and more about protecting the network from Sybil attacks, which could cripple bitcoin's censorship-free properties and erode trust in the network, rendering it worthless. Hence, protecting my investment. You may think this is unrealistic, but the recent uptick in spun up Classic nodes shows just how easy it is to establish a client base for such attacks.


How do you know? I could say you're confusing correlation with causation, too. You couldn't prove otherwise. 
Surely many nodes shut down in 2011 when their operators realized mining wasn't viable. But are you really arguing that no one has shut down their nodes due to increasing bandwidth requirements? CPU mining hasn't been viable since 2011; SPV wallets have existed since 2011 -- presumably users that shut down and/or migrated to SPV as a result did so a very, very long time ago. 
But then, how do you explain the massive drop in full nodes over the past 2-3 years? New users are using SPV -- fine. But why the continued *drop* in full nodes? 
Let's take a look. Unfortunately stats.bitcoin.it, dump.bitcoin.it and smsz.net are no longer maintained, so it'll be a real bitch to pull all the numbers back to 2010-2013 period. But here are some snapshots:
July 15, 2011
37,500 nodes
     
October 15, 2012
16,500 nodes
December 25, 2013 
8000 to 10000 nodes
April 28 2014
7400 nodes
April 7, 2015
6293 nodes
January 14, 2016
5581 nodes (0 Classic nodes)
March 8, 2016
6991 nodes (1347 Classic nodes)
I don't think the recent uptick in nodes -- which can be almost entirely attributed to new Classic nodes turning on (as opposed to Core nodes switching) -- can be seen as a reversal to the trend. Classic supporters see it as a voting mechanism, and services like  are specifically spinning up short-term paid nodes, such that half or more are running on AWS. 
Anyway, this isn't about trying to generalize and say "the perpetual drop in nodes is caused by *x*"... that's impossible. It's about acknowledging that we have reason to believe that bandwidth pressures are at least *partially* to blame, and therefore that we should address them rather than ignoring them. 
That's the problem I have with Classic's approach; it's just *ignore ignore ignore.* Just like the 2MB-10min DOS attack. Classic has no solution; they just ignore it, and say it's safe. It's not.
I acknowledge that Satoshi was very wrong in his assumptions about the evolution of mining and the existence of non-mining nodes. That he wrongly assumed the viability of CPU-mining and therefore conflated nodes with miners (while vastly underestimating mining centralization) does not remove the importance of peers in the p2p network. 
Nodes are still the "peers" in the p2p network that are responsible for validating all transactions, i.e defining what Bitcoin is. Hashpower has nothing to do with consensus rules or validation. Nodes do, by definition. Given that the vast majority of hashpower is shared among groups that I can count on 2 hands, I'm very uncomfortable with miners being the only ones running nodes. That simply puts miners in the place of central bankers. No thanks. I prefer a system where node operators keep miners (and other potential attackers) in check. 
There has to be some middle ground. We can't just accept that nodes are on a perpetual trend to zero -- and they are. And I've already been largely squeezed out -- I've already throttled maxconnections as much as possible, and have shut down multiple nodes that I used to run. Even with a top tier fiber connection -- I'm down to 16 maxconnections across 2 nodes, the absolute minimum, and that's eating nearly 30% of my monthly bandwidth cap. Double that and I have to choose between shutting down all of my nodes or curbing all other internet activities. 
If that's what it means to try to operate a node with a top tier residential connection in a major US city, I really have to wonder how we expect bitcoin to be a "global" currency at all, never mind peer-to-peer.

Fair enough -- let me clarify: The argument that a lack of block size increase will deter adoption and therefore drive interest into altcoins is not self-evident. But it's commonly claimed without anything to back it up. 
In any case, changes to the bitcoin protocol should not be judged on the basis of some altcoin startups. It should be judged on the best path forward, *for bitcoin.* That means listening to, and addressing concerns of node centralization, relay latencies, orphaning risks and potential attack vectors rather than using "sky is falling" rhetoric to dismiss opposition. 
Fortunately Core made some great optimizations in 0.12 (maxuploadtarget, blocksonly, maxmempool, libsecp256k1 and wallet pruning) which mitigate a lot of the bandwidth, memory and storage issues -- not to mention vastly improved initial sync time -- that would contribute to node centralization with increased block size. 
We still have further optimizations to make to mitigate the potential security and centralization trade-offs of a block size increase: improvements to bi-directional payment channels to reduce the number and size of transactions committed the blockchain; fraud proofs to improve the security of lightweight nodes; weak blocks and IBLTs to vastly reduce critical bandwidth required to relay blocks. These are all already in development and/or testing for release this year, to make a block size increase that much safer. 
And with things like Rootstock and the Lightning Network in the works, things look very, very bright for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:29:07
Well I think we can agree that all else equal, increased adoption would lead to an increased number of nodes. But part of the issue there is how expensive (or prohibitive) it is to run a node -- i.e. are we talking increased adoption under 1MB or increased adoption under 20MB? In the latter case, gains made as a result of adoption may be eclipsed by losses as a result of increased bandwidth required. At 20MB -- admittedly an extreme example -- my choice is clear: do not run a node. 
Indeed, the incentives to run a node (although they exist, as I've said) are lacking. The Lightning Network may offer some solutions there, since LN nodes/hubs will charge fees to route payments across the network. I'd even be open to some PoS or hybrid PoS solutions, but that would require years of research, planning and testing (and would probably encourage another "identity crisis" for bitcoin as we have now). 


That depends on the geographical distribution of nodes and the proportion that are operated in a centralized (cloud) vs. domestic (home) manner. While you might be correct that at 3000 nodes, the chances of successful Sybil attacks is low, the bigger issue is that the chance is much higher than at 6000 nodes. It is much higher than at 10,000 nodes in 2013 or 37,000 nodes in 2011. 
I can accept that 3000 nodes is *probably good enough.* But given that nodes are in perpetual decline -- indeed, on a trend to zero -- at what point do we say, this is a problem? How long do we wait to acknowledge it? 1000 nodes? 100 nodes? 10 nodes? Once bitcoin loses its censorship resistance, it may not be so easy to backtrack. 


Why? Anyone can contribute code to an open source project. Anyone can fork the codebase, just like XT and Classic did. If the economy supports some other implementation -- particularly in regards to changing consensus rules -- the protocol can fork. Core doesn't control anything. They may wield a lot of influence, but they ought to, given their tireless work over the years and technical expertise in cryptography, networks and security. Anyone is capable of analyzing the code they produce and making an informed decision whether or not to run their version of the code. That's what these discussions are about -- debating the merits of code.

That depends on how economical it is for the spender. The spender can do whatever he wants. I have no interest in stopping him. But I don't see cheap/free transactions as some fundamental "right" either. 
When blocks were small and bandwidth requirements low, they didn't cost much. But if we simply increase the block size at the first sign of hitting capacity, we are just externalizing the cost of  cheap/free transactions onto nodes as a matter of policy. I don't think that's an acceptable solution. 
Fees were meant to act as a deterrent for spam and DOS attacks and an incentive for miners to secure the network. Bitcoin was intended to use market mechanisms to secure the network -- it wasn't intended to subsidize the cost of transactions to cheap or free to the detriment of nodes and miners, who pay for that subsidy in the form of bandwidth and increased orphan risk.

Those that upgrade see reduced fees. Those that don't aren't squeezed out by bandwidth bottleneck. That is the ideal. 


Much of the argument against a fee market in the current context is that fees will be too high. That's the entire point -- to reduce fees for those that are reducing the bandwidth load of the increased throughput. You can't have it both ways.

To be included in a block -- yes. But signature data is not required to validate transactions themselves. The only issue is that a *block* needs to commit to the signatures of transactions to be valid.  


Old nodes can't, correct. They are depending on updated nodes to validate blocks. Updated nodes continue validating all [pruned] signature data. Old nodes don't need to *so long as witness nodes are doing so.*


Sure, in a philosophical sense. But not in regards to the protocol. The protocol just requires that a valid block conform to the signatures of the transactions contained within it. If not, the block is invalid. This is why we include both merkle roots in the coinbase transaction of the block, rather than requiring old nodes to validate every signature of every transaction. 


Yes, I acknowledge that they aren't fully validating. They are fully validating transactions within a block, but they make a security trade-off by trusting the network of witness nodes to validate the witness merkle tree.
This is much preferable to rendering them SPV nodes that only download block headers. The idea is: retain partially-validating nodes on the network, as a security measure against Sybils, allowing them to rely on the censorship resistance of the network. A strong network of nodes (old or new) neutralizes Sybils and prevents miner collusion... as such, there is a basis for assumption that they are not censored from other nodes which altogether do full validation. It's not ideal, but it seems to be the best compromise at present between increasing throughput and exacerbating declining node health. Such partially-validating nodes offer considerably more security to the network than SPV nodes (which offer nothing). 
This is why those of us who are most concerned about node health feel that Segwit already makes a massive compromise with big blockers on a way to move forward. No matter what, increased throughput (all else equal) will reduce security. The question is, to what extent does it have to?
I wish we had more numbers and theories to run a simulation regarding potential attack vectors that exploit the witness chain. TBH I have not seen much discussion of this. My thinking is that giving node operators the choice to remain partially validating peers is preferable to simply accepting the endless decline in operating nodes.

...and? The premise of bitcoin was to use economic incentives to create a self-balancing network. That may entail *not* pandering to miners' every whim (to achieve maximum possible fees at any given time) if it means retaining nodes on the network, which are vital to decentralization. We also need to consider incentives and disincentives for node operators -- not merely miners. 
Anyway, how do you know? Raising the limit will (for the foreseeable future) reduce fees by negating the fee market that exists at 1MB. 


For non-updated nodes vs. the increased throughput, it does. For updated nodes (that presumably can handle the increased throughput, including signature chain), it does not. The former is the beauty of this.


My recollection of Mark Friedenbach's explanation was that at 4MB, this is not a problem for the network, but at 8MB, it is. 
This is conflating two separate issues. The other issue regards a 2MB transaction that takes 10 minutes to validate, allowing new DOS attack vectors. This refers to a 2MB block size limit, not 1MB+Segwit.
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:34:54


Yes. Notice I said "transaction validation." 
The signature data is not *part* of the transaction; it doesn't describe what the transaction is doing. Within a transaction, there are multiple signatures possible; for a block to be valid, one of these possible signatures must exist for every transaction.  
The issue is not *transaction validity* but *block validity.* For a *block* to be valid, it needs to commit to the signatures of transactions. By untying the signature from the transaction hash -- 


That just leaves the matter of building two separate merkle trees, one with commitments to witnesses, and one with commitments to transactions as it is now, to address block validity.


What's wrong with that? It increases throughput capacity without pressuring bandwidth-limited nodes to drop off the network.


It's not. Raising the block size limit before relay improvements are implemented increases propagation latencies and orphaning risk. Raising the block size limit before mitigating bandwidth limitations (both in protocol and internet infrastructure at large) pressures bandwidth-limited nodes to shut down or become leechers that hurt the network.

Bitcoin's major use case is a decentralized inflation-controlled ledger. It's killer app was released at inception: math-based, censorship-resistant money. 
Ethereum is in its early experimental infancy. It is barely used as a network, as are dapps. Like Bitcoin in its infancy, it is extremely insecure, depending on luck and good actors to prevent catastrophic loss. ETH devs haven't even decided on total supply nor confirmed the method by which the blockchain will be secured (pow vs pos)... Even Vitalik said ETH is not intended as a store of value (one of bitcoin's primary use cases). I'm at a loss for how ETH begins to compete with Bitcoin's value proposition, never mind Bitcoin's far more robust network and first mover advantage. Frankly, I'm confused by the suggestion, as ETH is so incredibly complex (average joes find Bitcoin too complicated as it is), the idea that it would have mainstream appeal as a store of value is pretty far fetched. In a few years, we can talk, but ETH has its work cut out as far as even beginning to prove its viability regarding its stated use cases, let alone as a store of value that competes with Bitcoin. 
It shouldn't be necessary to say, but there need not be only one crypto for every use case. Trying to be everything will only take focus from Bitcoin's primary use case--a decentralized ledger of value. 
This fear mongering that "alts will displace Bitcoin so we need to fork now despite all opposition (because we want to get rich quick?)" is just that. Fear mongering. 
By the way, take a look at Rootstock, and realize just how irrelevant Ethereum might be. ;)

The advantage is being able to validate your transactions without trusting anyone else. The redundancy that allows that, of course, is lost if a few entities run all network nodes (i.e. in a data center). In that case, anyone relying on the system is perpetually subject to Sybil attacks. 
Can't use a cloud node to push your own transactions, either. You could use a lite wallet -- but there's that pesky trust issue, again....
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:48:27


Transaction validation is not the issue. See here: 
So yes, they are able to validate all transactions. And by building two separate merkle trees, one with commitments to witnesses, and one with commitments to transactions as it is now, the roots of which would be stored in the coinbase transaction... we have handled the issue of block validity. There is a security trade-off in that they are not fully validating blocks with the witness data (merely confirming that it is valid per the coinbase transaction). This seems preferable if the choice is between non-updated nodes continuing to validate all transactions vs. dropping off the network/resorting to SPV.


That was in reference to the context *you* used -- the maximum theoretical throughput allowed under Segwit. Not actual block size.


How? I see no discussion of the issue nor any proposed solution.
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:04:51
Only for nodes that update. Segwit is backwards compatible. It's the best of both worlds.

The implication is that bitcoin (the network) cannot be both censorship-free and a centralized payment processor like Visa (i.e. for your lattes). Visa, of course, is built as a central point of failure to maximize its processing power. The question is -- should bitcoin be just like Visa? Or should it sacrifice centralized efficiency to remain a censorship-free system?
If one argues that bitcoin can indeed be both, one would be hard-pressed to explain why nodes historically drop like flies as average block size has increased.
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:44:18


Transaction volume does not reliably measure the extent of adoption. You're approaching this in a vacuum, as if # of transactions is a static number attributable to a static number of "adopters." That is not the case. A single business can generate transaction volume that eclipses countless individual adopters; a single attacker can do the same with spam to attack the system. 
Increased transaction fees and/or confirmation times ought to act as a deterrent for spam, non-urgent payments that can be later batched, etc. For example, I am conscious of the costs to push transactions. Accordingly, I simply don't make as many bitcoin transactions as I used to. Ostensibly that makes more room for others to transact. However, as I said, a single business or attacker could eclipse countless such people as me without doing a thing to increase "adoption."


I understand that. Not sure I agree. I think wallet developers upgrading to more optimal fee estimation systems will alleviate most of the issues new users are having with stuck transactions. That is, for the proportion of new users that even need on-chain transactions (e.g. not Coinbase users).


There would be a *market* for fees, and like anything else, supply and demand reigns supreme. If that means that low-value transactions are priced out, so be it. Hopefully solutions like LN will mitigate that, but I refuse to reduce Bitcoin's utility to buying lattes. We can't simply throw everything out the window (including the economics that govern node operators) to ensure that the lowest-value transactions are economical. 
Were you also complaining in 2013 when (ironically) Gavin Andresen committed/merged the default node policy to refuse to relay transactions with dust outputs (&lt;5430 satoshi, later &lt;5460 satoshi)? The idea behind it was that if enough of the transaction's value is comprised by the fees it takes to spend it, we define it as nonstandard dust and do not relay by default.
There is a similar mechanism here. If enough of the transaction's value is comprised by the fees it takes to spend it, the transaction is uneconomical, and so the sender should bear the burden to spend it. He can do so, but that cost should not be externalized to the rest of the network. 




It is incumbent on wallet developers to make this workable for non-technical users. Core developers should not be wasting their time on UI, however.


Core developers have produced compelling evidence that suggests forking to 2MB now without first optimizing throughput and mitigating bandwidth and latency concerns is premature. They have laid out a detailed road map that addresses those concerns in preparation for a hard fork increase. 


Weak blocks are not ready, but indeed, they are a big part of the basis for justifying a future hard fork increase to the limit. Kudos to BU for implementing thin blocks, but the reality is that BU is a small hodge podge of unknown developers whose peer review, auditing and testing procedures are completely inadequate to apply to a production-state Core release. SPV-mining addresses orphan rate, but adds a significant level of trust to the network. It is a band-aid. Core has been working on a number of *real* solutions to delays in relay/propagation including weak blocks and IBLTs. But again, not ready yet. 


When will you become concerned about the number of nodes falling? Not at 16,000 or 10,000 or 7,000, but when?
It is possible to run a node at home at 1MB...for many people, yes. But it has become increasingly costly. Personally I have shut down multiple nodes that I used to run years ago, and I have throttled my remaining nodes to 8 maxconnections each to remain under my fiber optic plan's bandwidth cap. And that's with top tier speed (but capped). I'm in a major US city, so this is a best-case scenario. 75% of the US doesn't have fiber. And much of the world -- Africa, the South Pacific, the Middle East and South America -- is largely lacking in reliable broadband internet at all. 
Remember -- I'm coming from the perspective of someone with access to internet connectivity that most of the world does not have. We can't *only* plan for the "average" or "better-than-average" connections, as that eliminates the majority of people's ability to be a peer on the network and/or validate their own transactions. Further, bitcoin ought to be built to withstand periods of disruption to the regional and global internet infrastructure (i.e. downage of broadband services). We cannot merely plan for *only* the best-case scenarios -- to do so in engineering is heresy. Worst-case scenarios should be the basis for planning.
Anecdotally we know that people are running nodes in the cloud rather than at home (I've done so myself) due to residential bandwidth limitations. That is obviously more centralized (how many are on AWS alone?) and based in trust (you do not physically control your node -- someone else does) than domestic nodes. 
Fortunately Core is working tirelessly to mitigate bandwidth concerns *in preparation for a future hard fork increase to the block size limit.* maxuploadtarget, blocksonly, maxmempool and wallet pruning = so, so sexy. 
--&gt; traffic limiting for bandwidth-limited nodes
--&gt; full validation and block relay but no transaction relay = 88% bandwidth savings for bandwidth-limited nodes
--&gt; mempool limiting to mitigate nodes crashing on low-RAM machines
--&gt; pruned wallet mode can reduce disk usage from ~60GB to ~2GB
This means that nodes can control their traffic usage, dropping relay of old information first in the case of throttling. It means that nodes can fully validate and forward blocks but not transactions, so they can still be a net positive for the network and self-validate while realizing massive bandwidth savings. It means that nodes running on Rasberry Pis or similar are much more reliable. It means that running fully validating nodes on mobile phones (albeit pruned) is finally actually possible. This is all fantastic news, and will make the network far more resilient under increased load. 
In other words, they are mitigating all of the security trade-offs presented by Segwit and a block size increase, to make them safer for the network. Just see the road map to see how far we've come: 
Seems to me that we're chugging along just fine. 


Is bitcoin just some giant honeypot, in your opinion? This is some serious conspiracy theorizing that I am not particularly interested in. 
Anyway, like I've said, it's an open source project. The code can be analyzed. The code can be forked. No one is forcing anyone to run it. There have been compatible alternative implementations for years. With XT, Classic and Unlimited, there are incompatible alternative implementations. I'm not sure what you'd like to see, short of being able to hand-pick teams of developers yourself, perhaps? That, of course, leads to a new set of problems. :P


That's never been the argument. Sure -- BIP101's 8GB upper limit was absurd because we could never possibly test for those conditions. But that's neither here nor there.




Oh? That's odd. I'm not sure what we've been arguing about for the past year (or five) then. 0.12 added optimizations that make it much safer. Segwit, weak blocks and IBLTs next.

That would be unfortunate, but it's not clear that this justifies doing anything besides implementing/improving fee estimation (and encouraging wallet developers to do the same) and RBF/CPFP protocols. 
We bitcoin users have had to endure some tense moments. In August 2010, a stack overflow vulnerability allowed an attacker to bring 92 billion BTC into existence. In March 2013, a miner on version 0.8.0 created a block that hard forked bitcoin into two networks, as it was invalid according to version 0.7.x. 
It would be nice if people would remember that in spite of the fact that we have so much money on the line (invested in bitcoin), that it is a beta software that does indeed have limitations, as well as unknown bugs and attack vectors. I wish people would approach it from that perspective, rather than attaching arbitrary standards about "mass adoption required NOW." 
My metric for success is whether bitcoin is still running as intended, first and foremost.

On one hand, Classic supporters claim that 28 days is adequate to get the entire network to upgrade in the case of a hard fork. 
On the other hand, it's perfectly reasonable that after a year of intense debate about block size and fee markets -- and 10 months since the first Coinwallet stress test -- that users are incapable of figuring out how to send a proper fee. 
Does not compute. Even if someone couldn't wrap his head around how to pay a slightly larger fee manually, several wallets can do it for him. 
The testnet fork didn't require much discussion because the problem was easily discovered and fixed. It was simply due to a node running an old version. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:11:21
That was never a policy. Satoshi suggested such, but given that the limit has never been increased, whether it is needed (or justifiable) is subject to debate. If indeed a change is necessary, the burden is still on those advocating the change to prove why it is a) necessary and b) safe, and therefore justifiable.
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:53:09
Increasing block size does nothing to improve *scalability* (the *capability* of the network to process a growing amount of work). It simply allows more throughput, with no regard to whether or not we should optimize said throughput to make the network scalable. Increasing the block size does nothing to make throughput more efficient; it does nothing to mitigate the negative effects of increased throughput. 
Segwit optimizes throughput by segregating data that is specifically unnecessary for transaction validation. That makes the network more scalable, by allowing for increased throughput without externalizing bandwidth costs onto nodes that cannot pay for them. 
Weak blocks make the network more scalable since peers pre-validate blocks in which miners have not yet successfully found the nonce. Once they do, the amount of data miners (and peers) need to propagate is tiny (32 bits), relieving miners from propagation latency and therefore directly addressing orphaning risks posed by an increased block size, as well as the specific reason why miners publish empty blocks.

I think we should avoid acting like children screaming in the back seat of the car. "Are we there yet?!?!" LN is a major undertaking that requires extensive analysis, code writing, testing. Developers -- just like the bitcoin network -- have limitations. We should embrace them with the understanding that 1) bitcoin is working absolutely fine, as intended, right now and 2) programming (particularly with so much value on the line) is a long, slow, drawn-out and redundant process that attempts to eliminate all weaknesses and attack vectors **before** releasing a client for production. Not after. 


There is no such thing as reliable 0-conf transactions. No one should be using them. Double-spending is incredibly easy to do against recipients of 0-conf transactions. For all our wants of instant gratification, we need to work within the limits of the bitcoin protocol rather than simply inventing arbitrary standards like "we need reliable 0-conf transactions." That will never, ever happen. There is no way to stop a spender from re-spending spent inputs and re-broadcasting them with a higher fee.

The number itself doesn't matter; it's the trend that matters. There's no magic number. Being able to launch a Sybil attack entails flooding nodes with attacking nodes such that *most connections* are attackers. This is likely to be most logistically feasible on a regional basis, so the global distribution of nodes is less important. I'm not particularly concerned with the lack of nodes in Africa, given that there are likely very few users there. I think we would expect nodes to reflect the geographical distribution of users. One exciting development that pruned wallets bring is the possibility of mobile full nodes -- perhaps making adoption in Africa possible, for instance, given the prevalence of mobile as the only form of internet connectivity. 


I don't think anyone is suggesting 1MB forever. I've been talking about optimizing node software and relay networks to make a block size increase safer (because it's inevitable). 
I'm also not convinced that fees will be prohibitive. The only way to find out, though, is to let the market determine that. Eventually the fee market will be the *only way* to incentive miners to secure the network. Nearly 75% of all bitcoins have already been mined... eventually we will need to address that.

Meh. Their business model fleeces debtors with high interest. They then fleece all merchants with processing fees -- which they further incentivize with rewards for non-risk customers. It's pretty smart.


My thinking is that we shouldn't *limit* bitcoin to being like credit cards. Not being a replacement for Visa is a feature, not a bug -- to use that horribly obnoxious phrase.


Case in point. Where credit cards fail -- one example being censorable or illegal transactions -- bitcoin fills the void. I'm greatly concerned that bitcoin remains decentralized enough to remain censorship-free, and I'm not very concerned about people using it to buy lattes. They can, but I don't mind if they have to pay uneconomical fees or use off-chain solutions once they are available.


For states to remove cash as an option, everyone needs a bank account. We're not even close. Maybe in Sweden, but this is not a reality for the vast majority of the world. So many millions of people live off the books. In lieu of cash, other alternatives emerge: cashier's checks, money orders, escrows, stored value accounts (gift cards, e-wallets)... the latter is particularly important here as un-banked people often do have access to mobile phones.
Of course, one doesn't buy lattes online. :P


How soon is too soon? In my own case, these days, I minimize the number of transactions I make, batching payments and frankly, cut micro-transactions out entirely. I just don't need to use bitcoin for every little transaction, even if it was novel and cool to do so for a while.
@_date: 2016-03-22 18:14:35
So, if mining is centralized, we should centralize nodes as well? Is that the thinking here?
@_date: 2016-03-23 18:18:25


No, I'm quite sure I do. Consensus-based protocols are nothing new. If nodes enforce different rules, they break consensus and fork onto a different network. 


Firstly, 75% miners being "extremely confident" doesn't mean they have complete information on which fork the userbase supports. Where they point their hash power is just a temporary condition. Nodes can be easily spun up, and not all nodes are reachable. And this idea that exchanges are all that matters is LOL. Like users, they only vote with their nodes, and have no control over which nodes the user base runs. 


And? If there are multiple surviving blockchains, exchanges could in theory deliver all of them, or even allow them to trade against each other. In a contentious split, two chains with incompatible rules would both still have a market cap and a market; it's just probably the case that their combined market cap will be lower than now, due to erosion of trust in the protocol's ability to enforce consensus rules.
In a contentious hard fork situation, exchanges that support the Classic fork put themselves in a precarious situation. Once inputs from newly minted coins on the Classic fork are sufficiently mixed with their inputs, coins will be tainted and unspendable on the original chain. In contrast, any exchange enforcing the original consensus rules ensures that any "bitcoins" they send their customers are spendable on the original network (and any other fork). In the former situation, they open themselves up to fraud lawsuits for delivering customers "bitcoins" which cannot be spent on the original (and functioning) bitcoin network. These would be interesting times indeed!


Sure. You could always pay an adequate fee. But even then, there is no guarantee a block would be found in less than an hour. What's the issue here, anyway? I transact with bitcoin all the time. Since this whole bloody mess of threatening contentious hard forks began a year ago, I've paid 2-8 cents on all transactions and have never been delayed more than 2 blocks. Fear mongerers be fear mongering.


Define failed. It won't be immediately clear during a fork, but a chain is only worthy if users are willing to accept the rules (and accordingly use the network). Hash power doesn't say anything about that. Oh, a majority of miners are "confident?" Well, let's see if they're right. I'll be running a Core node and not moving any coins. 
There is already code ready for testing to immediately retarget difficulty in the case of a very significant drop in hash rate. One could easily perceive miners' attempts to change the rules from under users that disagree as an attack -- a "75% attack" if you will. And this would be an appropriate and sufficient response.


If 75% of miners are relaying blocks whose coinbase transactions inflate the supply beyond 21 million, surely I would fork them off, too. "Economically important" has no bearing on a p2p system. Peers call the shots because peers enforce the rules. Any miner or exchange can temporarily support any fork they want (even one that inflates the supply by some multiple) -- but they may very well make the wrong choice. And they will pay for it, to be sure.

SPV mining makes Lite nodes vulnerable to confirmed tx that are later rejected because miners are susceptible to building on invalid blocks. See July 2015 chain forks where two invalid chains (3 and 6 blocks long) were mined due to this vulnerability.

I don't believe that's ever been the case as far as we know. In the July forks, it was Antpool and F2pool who were mining on the invalid chains IIRC. I think the general consensus is that they are still SPV mining, but we really don't know until another fork occurs due to non-validation. 
Pretty much everyone agrees that mining without validation is bad practice. Even Gavin himself: 
So why would we spread that sort of practice to *all* miners? If all miners are mining without validating blocks/tx, such forks could be far more detrimental and difficult to repair without manual intervention. 
Miners are also by and large using software that will ignore Gavin's 30-second limit node policy, so SPV nodes are really in danger here:

What is the argument to increase the block size limit? To increase throughput. What does Segwit do? It increases throughput. 
It is a much better solution because a) it is backwards compatible -- no risk of chain fork; and b) it optimizes throughput to mitigate the negative impacts of the increase.
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:29:31
Nobody said you could "fit more" transactions in a 1MB block. The point is that if there is a transaction backlog, you raise your fee from the default. Like anything else in life, you pay for priority. I've been using bitcoin for about 4 years and I've never had a stuck transaction. But if I *did* have one even once, I would figure out how to avoid it in the future. 
Again, doing this manually is quite simple, and more wallets are integrating the ability to handle this for their users entirely, without their intervention. I just don't see a problem here. Further, opt-in Replace-by-fee and Child pays for parent protocols will further assist with this. Once wallets integrate them (i.e. good UI), we have other ways for non-technical users (or their tx recipients) to fix their earlier screw-ups.

Plenty of people have been doing so for days on Twitter, Bitcointalk, Reddit. He hasn't provided any substantive response, just a blank dismissal of all criticism on Twitter and Reddit earlier. 
And Gavin himself has said it's very bad for the network, so I want him to explain his about-face:
We know it's a risk because of the July forks. If you don't see how people can lose money when a majority of miners are mining on an invalid chain several blocks deep, I'm not going to take the time to explain it all.


Google it.


Sure. That doesn't mean that *all miners are SPV mining.* It certainly doesn't mean that all miners *should* be SPV mining, either.


Not all miners are doing it. So it's introducing non-validation to miners that fully validate. Why the hell would we cement that bad behavior into the protocol? It's not "if you're going to do it"; it assumes behavior that isn't happening. Go see what fully validating miners (who have better orphan rates than F2Pool/Antpool) have to say: 


Actually you have it backwards. The reward vs. cost to double spend doubles when block subsidy halves. (Mining an invalid block as part of an attack costs half as much reward)


Evidence that this is what miners what? Two pools are known to do it -- to what extent we don't know, because we can't verify how much they *are* validating if anything. Other miners like Kano/CkPool/Bitfury has called it bad practices. Miners have both short term interest (block rewards) and long term interest (securing the network). Some realize that they cannot always ignore the latter, even if you don't.

It just makes the point that breaking consensus rules = splitting off networks. So we need to be *very careful* to have widespread agreement on any such changes, otherwise multiple networks that call themselves "bitcoin" will emerge.


Maybe, but I'm not so sure it's this simple. We may find that more than one fork retains value and is worth mining. Once difficulty readjusts, judging the value of one network over the other could be difficult.

Are you saying there is no difference between BTCD and Bitcoin Classic? They have different consensus rules (or at least, *one* has a trigger to upgrade to different consensus rules).
There is nothing wrong with alternative clients. BTCD has run alongside Core for years. The problem arises when one client's network forks from the other with no agreement on the longest, valid chain. In the former case, we are talking about *compatible* clients. In the latter, *incompatible* clients. 


Indeed validity is 100% the issue. One client may view the others' blocks as invalid, causing a chain fork. Chain forking with overwhelming miner consensus (95%) would hopefully end well, but even carries some risk. Consider the BIP66 fork, which resulted in a longer *invalid* chain being mined 6 blocks deep before hashpower corrected to the valid chain. (And another 3-block chain fork the following day) ...and this was an intentional update. SPV mining is still widely-used of course, and anyone who accepted payments based on up to 6 (and 3) confirmations on SPV wallets lost money.

I think that's rather an absurd comparison. Developers shouldn't have "equal opportunity" to have their code implemented into Bitcoin. Code should be implemented based on merit and decisions to do so ought to be highly discriminatory. 


This is why development must be a slow, regimented process that works towards a gradual consensus rather than shock-and-awe campaigns on political grounds that hastily push rule changes without actually reaching protocol consensus nor overall agreement within the community.
No one said XT and Classic weren't underdogs. But they attempt to change consensus rules, and therefore should achieve overarching agreement among the community to fork the protocol. That burden is on their developers and supporters. 
I have no control over what Theymos does, nor r/btc moderators. But if there is indeed overwhelming support for Classic, anything Theymos does should be fairly trivial.

There *are* incentives, but they are intangible. One cannot validate his own transactions without running a node, for instance, so failing to do so removes the principal benefit of bitcoin.
Users (prospective node operators), like miners, do have specific long term interests in retaining bitcoin as a robust, decentralized system. After all, they hold bitcoin (just as miners mine it). If there is only one, or a few validating nodes comprising the entire network (and the rest of us merely run SPV nodes), then bitcoin has failed to remain a trustless system and accordingly has little value. 
There are incentives at the user and network levels to run a node, but they are indeed completely intangible. But given that the network depends on the existence of nodes (peers) to remain a p2p system, we should also approach the question from the side of disincentives. 
What is the principle disincentive to operate a node? Upload bandwidth limitations. I can tell you from experience -- operating multiple nodes with high maxconnections on my fiber optic connection just got my internet service capped by AT&amp;T at 250GB/month. I've lowered my maxconnections, but if I ever approach that limit, I will simply shut down my nodes rather than curbing my other internet activities. That's exactly what we need to prevent. Given that my connection is among the fastest residential connections in the world, and I am *still* struggling to operate the same nodes I ran 1-3 years ago -- this indicates that bandwidth limitations are a *real* issue here, and that we need to approach the block size issue with respect to them. 
In the long term, it's hard to say how we will secure network node health. I'm open to some PoS or hybrid PoS ideas, but such will require extensive research and testing, and very careful planning.
In the short term, we simply need to keep bandwidth bottlenecks from getting worse. In time, internet infrastructure will improve, and plans are in the works to mitigate bandwidth limitations. In the meantime, Segwit improves throughput capacity without exacerbating the problem. So I see it as the ideal short term solution.

If consensus rules (like the 21 million coin limit) are shown *not* to be immutable, people will wonder what value bitcoin really has. That means that the majority can simply steal from the minority based on a vote. 
Tread carefully when advocating for a hard fork. Because *you* would be forking off from the original network. Whether the users and wealth follow you is not up to you. 
On that note, how do you know what the majority of users even wants? Because a bunch of sockpuppets on Reddit and Twitter said something? Because a single entity brings thousands of nodes online under his sole control? These are the metrics? 
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:40:34


You said:


I suggested how they are the basis for defining what bitcoin is, and are the basis for user security. You seem to have missed the point that **miners and exchanges are irrelevant on a network with no users**. So if 1% of nodes and a majority of miners fork onto a different network, what makes you think that the 99% don't matter? If 1% of nodes and a majority of miners decide to remove the 21 million coin supply, would you expect all nodes to be falling over themselves to update to those rules? 


Roughly agree, though these are temporary conditions. There is code ready to adjust difficulty in the case of a suddenly large drop in hash rate. And saying that users can buy/sell/spend bitcoins only on one chain assumes 1) there is widespread consensus among exchanges and 2) that the consensus agrees on *the original rules*, not the forked rules. The latter would be implied because any coins that are valid under the original consensus rules are valid under the new consensus rules (assuming we are talking about removing consensus rules, like the block size limit). So the only people in real trouble in that situation are users on the new fork who may hold tainted outputs that cannot be spent on the original chain. Users holding coins that are valid on the original chain can always spend their coins on the forked chain in this case. Users on the forked chain cannot. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 04:25:25


Indeed, I would hold off moving any coins for a while. Users are in a safer position (assuming they know what's going on -- big assumption) than are miners, who need to act quickly off incomplete information.




Sure, and tbh that's all we can really do. If miners want to fork (whether against most users or not), that's not up to me. But that doesn't mean that the end result will necessarily be pretty. I'd prefer it if Classic used a significantly higher or significantly lower threshold for rules activation, so as not to leave perception of "what bitcoin is" so indeterminate. Either we are concerned with remaining a single cohesive network -- and I surely am -- or we aren't. If we aren't, I'd much prefer that those in favor of a fork-at-any-cost do so without claiming ownership of bitcoin. Because surely 75% of miners should not decide for 100% of the userbase that the network is splitting.


Ultimately, Bitcoin is a fucking honeybader and will continue evolving.
Yup, no argument there.

I did not look at the code, but the Github description does contain this:
"There is a hard-coded 30-second timeout; if the full block data takes longer than 30 seconds to get validated and propagated across the network, or is never sent, miners switch back to mining non-empty blocks on the last fully-validated block."
Is that not the case, or are we talking about different things? Does this mean that attacks based on this vulnerability can only be mounted during that 30 second window? Obviously that's still quite bad for everyone involved, but I just want to be clear.
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:54:29


He didn't. He just states that it's an accounting trick and a "subsidy to LN" but doesn't establish what the problem actually is.
 






Testing suggests that the 4MB under adversarial assumptions may be perfectly safe. If continued testing shows 4MB to be a problem, we can alter the signature discount to account for it. 
Of note, the 4MB case affects witness nodes -- whose operators presumably updated because of less concern for bandwidth and latency limitations. Non-updated nodes unaffected -- that's the point.


Where's the math? With this limit, to what extent can someone create a "poison block?" Gavin doesn't show any math on his "guided tour" blog, but claims that blocks won't "take minutes to validate." How many minutes? Just now, a block was found within 1 minute of the last. Can the code prevent DOS attacks under this circumstance, or not? I haven't seen any mathematical basis for this limit. Per Luke: 




A more elegant fix in which the quadratic validation architecture is reworked to directly address the attack vector would be ideal. When you posted the link, that's what I expected to find. I guess that was unlikely since the intention of Classic was to push a block size limit increase to production as quickly as possible, without any optimizations. 
Simply limiting signature operations is a crude approach; so-called poison blocks actually do wonders to reduce UTXO bloat: 
But I can accept it if math is shown to limit the attack vector based on realistic block propagation times (i.e. not 10 minutes, but 30 seconds - 1 minute).

But that's out of our control. Adoption has been happening for years and continues to happen. If the implication is that increasing the block size limit might lead to increased adoption -- I'd ask for some evidence. "Build it and they will come" might be right. Might be wrong. The more important question there is whether the centralization/security trade-offs are worth it. 
If bitcoin were to lose its censorship-resistant qualities, whether or not it's "normal" or achieves mass adoption loses importance. There would be nothing to distinguish it from other assets and payment channels that are centrally-controlled. 


It doesn't matter. Like any form of money, it can be used for legal or illegal purposes. I'm not interested in stopping anyone from doing anything that isn't harming anyone else. 


That depends on what bitcoin is useful for. Perhaps it will be adopted largely as a store of value rather than a payment channel. Perhaps one *can* use bitcoin for latte purchases, but maybe in the future those payments will be routed via the Lightning Network. 
I don't think we are wanting for legitimate use cases for bitcoin. They are there as they always have been.

Apples and oranges. Have we ever hard forked to increase the block size limit? No. The soft limits were never an issue of consensus.


No, I don't. Nodes are already in perpetual decline against increasing block size. What evidence do you have that doubling the upload bandwidth requirements won't exacerbate the increasing centralization of nodes?
The arguments have been laid out ad nauseum. Aside from the absurd activation threshold of 75% which makes a chain fork highly likely... frankly, I'm not going to waste my time. 
Segwit does not increase block size -- it increases *throughput capacity.* That's the goddamn point. It optimizes throughput so we don't have to increase block size yet, therefore putting unnecessary bandwidth pressure on nodes, which are already in perpetual decline. Are there developments in the works to mitigate these bandwidth requirements? Yes. See the Core roadmap.
I got capped by my cable company for running my nodes (or for streaming HD video, video-conferencing and online gaming). I live in a major US city. What happened after that? I shut down my nodes. There is no tangible economic benefit to running a node, so when faced between curbing other internet activities and shutting down my nodes, the obvious answer is to shut them down. 
Putting these unnecessary pressures on node operators makes the entire network more prone to Sybil-based attacks. And frankly, this sort of talk makes it sound like a future where we all run SPV nodes that trust Coinbase and Bitpay sound acceptable. Fuck that.
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:57:36


And how will this work? I'm all ears if we aren't ignoring the actual costs of processing throughput for the sake of including all possible transactions for free/cheap. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 08:12:54


On node centralization:
We can soon increase throughput with widespread consensus through a soft fork, so why would we hard fork right now? The risk of a chain fork and catastrophic losses for users isn't justified when there are safer approaches we can take. 
Propagation delays: There is a direct relationship between the size of the block and the time taken to propagate through the network; and blocks involved in an orphan race are significantly larger, on average, than blocks that are not in a race...large block propagation may pose quantifiable risk to mining returns.
And, well, why not:


What's your point? To be perfectly frank, I'm not even concerned about increasing capacity right now. We need to fix the security problems that 1MB blocks have exposed the network to before anything else. Fortunately, 0.12 made great progress in addressing node centralization concerns. 
And in the adversarial 4MB Segwit case -- firstly, that case under testing is shown to be on the far end of what the network can handle (i.e. it's fine), and secondly, it won't be 4x the block size for non-Segwit nodes. That's the point.

That retort suggests that demand is distributed equally among all users. It is not. Some will be willing to pay more, others not. Not everyone will simply "follow this guide."
This particularly rings true for those who are intentionally spending outputs with less-than-recommended fees. Regarding today's backlog, here is one interesting thing to look at:  
As indicated there, we should not assume that all users a) are paying the recommended fee, b) are paying/are willing to pay higher than the recommended fee, and c) are even concerned about getting transactions confirmed at all. In the latter case, block explorers and wallets commonly show unconfirmed transactions -- meaning that a spammer can advertise to every node on the network and pay absolutely nothing. And yes, his transactions are currently backlogged in the mempool with everyone else.
It's quite easy to create a large backlog in the mempool. Just endlessly create spends (with confirmed or unconfirmed outputs) that spend less than the recommended fee. If you want to be relatively sure that your transactions won't confirm at all, don't pay any fee at all. Your transactions will contribute to the backlog. Rinse and repeat. Keep repeating as "stuck transaction" posts flare up on Reddit. 
If, for instance, you want to take advantage of bitcoin's extremely high level of redundancy to propagate (and store) data extremely cheaply, you might do exactly that. If never confirmed, your spam is constantly being transmitted (advertised) across the network to all nodes. For free. If confirmed, you're paying next to nothing for extremely redundant, distributed storage. 
I see no end to the demand for such nearly-free (sometimes free) storage/advertisement. We, typical bitcoin users -- in contrast to such actors -- simply want our transactions confirmed in a timely manner. We have much greater incentive to "follow this guide" and accordingly, as fees rise, spammers are more likely to be priced out than us.

Satoshi said he hoped that free transactions would help to bootstrap the network -- there was never any intention to keep bitcoin transactions free (or nearly free). 7 years later, the supply is 75% mined out. We are past the bootstrapping phase. If Satoshi thought otherwise, I think he was plainly wrong. 
Without full blocks -- without fee pressure -- there is no guarantee whatsoever of miner revenue once subsidy is gone (halving in 24 days should be a stark reminder of that). That means there is no incentive whatsoever for miners to secure the network for users. That breaks the entire security premise and trust model of bitcoin -- security via financial incentive. 
If most of the mining network shuts down once the subsidy dwindles -- due to virtually free transactions and therefore little fee revenue -- it would be trivially easy to attack users once difficulty adjusts. Mining overhead is calculated in fiat, not bitcoin. That means that byzantine attackers can maliciously reorganize the blockchain using previously obsolete hashpower. Once we are in this situation -- where usability is dead due to the unreliability of confirmations -- the only solution may be to hard fork increase the 21 million coin supply, to incentivize miners to unanimously secure the network, rather than attack it. I say that is the only solution because I suspect getting users *at that time* to *begin* to pay fees that cover the cost of confirmations will be completely impossible. When users have been sold this [bullshit] dream of perpetually free transactions, why would they *then* start paying to use a broken system? They won't.

This is not an apt comparison. There is a difference between a flaw at the protocol level and an exploit at the application level. 
In the former case, every user in the ecosystem has incentive to fix the flaw, as it threatens every user's security. 
In the latter case, only DAO token holders are incentivized to fix the flaw. The rest of the ecosystem may not want the immutability of their contracts threatened just to bail out DAO holders. The rest of the ETH ecosystem is unaffected, as this particular issue (the DAO split function) is not a protocol issue. 
Having said that, the DAO bug did expose a significant security exploit in Solidity: 
So the entire ecosystem *may indeed* have a united interest in forking Ethereum to fix this protocol vulnerability. 
However, this does not change the fact that they *do not* have universal interest in bailing out the DAO. Different forks have different purposes. I believe that the blockchain should not be forked (soft or hard) to censor the child DAO in question, nor to violate the DAO contract to return the "lost" money. 
I do believe the blockchain should be forked if/when ETH devs ever figure out how to make Solidity and Serpent secure. I have grave doubts that they will ever be able to, though. But I believe they should attempt to.

Could you point to some of that propaganda? Preferably from *at least* a handful of Core developers since that group comprises many dozens of people? There should be some sort of burden of proof here. To be honest, most of your repeated, baseless insults and assumptions are quite like propaganda.


Firstly, Segwit will allow block weight (parallel to block size) of up to 4MB. Aggregate signatures can drop signature size by 30-40% --&gt; direct addition to capacity. All of this is on-chain. LN is *actually* scalable rather than optimizations to a broadcast network (hint: broadcast networks do not scale). And LN is trustless. No custodians. So you can stop with this nonsense about centralized payment processors. Even if LN devolved into a hub-and-spoke model, users do not put funds at risk. There is no trust; just rebroadcast the last channel state to the chain. And in the hub-and-spoke model, users are likely just dealing with the major payment processors/exchanges they deal with every day. Virtually all merchant transactions are done through Bitpay already (small amount done by other firms like Coinbase), so no big change there. 


This is just meaningless nonsense. *This* is propaganda.

Ah, fear mongering without evidence. That's something I recognize.


Where's your evidence? Transaction flooding is not particularly expensive at current fee levels. As you can see from a chart from average block size, it is spikes erratically. One could easily argue that the spike in the summer was an aberration in a much slower trend. Correlation =/= causation. I mentioned various reasons why average block size may have diminished since then:


It's also quite possible that wasteful services optimized their code to save on transaction fees. Services and people are probably batching their spends more efficiently. Here's an example of how that works (interestingly in a thread about why blocks aren't full): 


There is no fee market without a cap on throughput. The protocol is supposed to create a system that incentivizes rational mining for security and ease of running a node for decentralized validation. The limit actively caps spam and retains block space for users. As Satoshi said:




As I said, I'm fine with fees rising. I'm fine with demand outpacing capacity. Nevertheless, the conversation has been ongoing for the better part of a year. Segwit has been released into production at 0.13.0 and there will be activation logic in the next release. 


Indeed. And *if* there were somehow "consensus" to hard fork (like I said, that's impossible to measure), this was Satoshi's take on that:


When do you think Segwit versions are going to obsolete? How many years away is that?


Disagree. That's a falsity that some people, like you, are trying to pass off. Show me more evidence than a couple of Reddit posts. Regardless, "most" isn't enough for "consensus."


You keep saying that. How does it foster centralization? Particularly with post-Segwit capacity optimizations and Lightning Network coming. 


Firstly, LN requires Segwit (or some other malleability fix). Now that Segwit is in a production release, we are just waiting for activation logic in the next release. That release is 90% done: 
Then it's just up to miners to activate it. Secondly, LN is a very complex endeavor with big problems to solve. And testing should also be rigorous. Here are some preliminary tests: 


Core is not tasked with developing Lightning. You can check the roadmap, the notes from each IRC meeting and the mailing list to see what they are working on. There are five or six different teams working on different implementations (which will eventually be interoperable). Rome was not built in a day. 


You appear to have a tenuous grasp on how the protocol works, and you don't appear to keep up with Core or Lightning development. And you keep spreading this undeserved vitriol. This shit is really unnecessary and I'm having a hard time remaining respectful towards you. 


I said:


In other words, you didn't provide a source for anything, and I can presume that you're just spreading misinformation. Perhaps you are doing so intentionally. I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, but you keep refusing to address any of the points I've made while repeating your baseless insults and conspiracy theories. 


There you go again..... (sigh)
@_date: 2016-09-21 21:44:23


What is "enough?"


Actually, Core respects the consensus by not attempting to break it. You are free to fork the protocol and attempt to split the network. Maybe some people are interested in following you. I'm not.


What about Segwit-enabling optimizations and Lightning are centralized?


Show me the data. The IC3 study said 4MB would kick 10% of nodes off the network, and they only tested one factor. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 20:15:18


You have it backwards. *You* are suggesting a change that entails a security trade-off. Make the case. 


I'm suggesting that using Bitcoin in a trust-based manner is missing the point. And the more you suggest downgrading everyone's personal security, the more you suggest hurting overall network health. 


Sure thing. Same thing goes for being a customer of a bank. That's not *being your own bank.*


The point of removing central authority is *to remove trust.* Removing central authority wasn't an end unto itself. 


We've come full circle. How do you know any given set of nodes is unreliable? How do you know if you are actually communicating with the Bitcoin network in a Sybil attack? You wouldn't know...
@_date: 2016-09-23 21:30:59


Exactly. Hence my suggestion that you are putting the cart before the horse.


Actually, historically there were free transactions. Even past the very early days, some transactions were free based on priority policies (coin age, minimum output size. 


They also have reasons to reject cheap fees, to make room for more valuable transactions. Hence fee enforcement policies that result in half-full blocks and thousands of perpetually unconfirmed transactions. 


More baseless fear mongering. You haven't shown any evidence that 7 - 16 cent fees is discouraging adoption. And again, Segwit activation is coming in the next Core release (not a major release). Lightning will be available thereafter. Many optimizations for capacity in the works (on-chain), and LN for the rest. I'm not going to bother listening to you screaming that the sky is falling. You sound increasingly desperate as we approach Segwit activation. 


I repeatedly asked you for evidence of this, and you respond by repeating your baseless assertions. Also, remember that Bitcoin is about users -- not businesses trying to profit off users. 


You just repeat insults rather than showing evidence of this supposed shortsightedness. 


Thanks for ignoring all of my responses to you and repeating this dumb question. Here you go: 






Bitcoin doesn't need breathing space because a) blocks are not full and b) if they were, it functions beautifully. Increasing maxblocksize at this point would take far longer than implementing Segwit. Segwit was already released in Core 0.13.0. Meanwhile, Classic's testnet was recently fried for over a month because Roger Ver's BU miners forked the network by breaking Classic's rules. LOL. 


I wonder why Classic's testnet recently had a persistent fork then. 


Jihan Wu did, many months ago. And more recently he said: "I don't think I will vote for BIP109. We need a plan that will not drag the community into the blocksize issue from now on. For the growth of Bitcoin, blocksize is a minor issue that cost the community so much damage." You don't get outside of the r/btc / bitco.in bubble much, do you? Your assertion that miners won't activate Segwit is pretty weak. In any case, talk is cheap -- let's see what happens when 0.13.1 is released. 


I don't think maxblocksize should be increased at all. Frankly, I'd prefer it if blocks were smaller, and I'm not particularly happy about the increased bandwidth requirements we can expect from Segwit.


Like I said: you don't appear to keep up with Core or Lightning development. Your suggestions are bad, and your assertions that Segwit and LN are vaporware are laughable. Clearly, you have no idea what is going on. 


I've stated numerous reasons why this is a terrible idea. And you've only given me made-up (inaccurate) data about how 4MB blocks would degrade the network. You aren't convincing anyone here.

One area of interest is Sybil attacks. Sybil attacks are about controlling the nodes *which you connect to* (by injecting attacker nodes which appear normal to you). The easiest groups to Sybil attack are those in areas where there are very few validating nodes. In that case, it is very easy to inject enough attacker nodes into the region so that honest nodes are no longer communicating with the Bitcoin network. Connected SPV nodes obviously are also affected by this attack. The Sybils can then censor all transactions out of the region. This can also be combined with a miner attack intent on double spending. 


What is the criteria for "developed?" There is a massive difference in internet infrastructure between places like the US/Australia and Europe. Further, is that really the criteria we want to use? We want Bitcoin to be globally accessible, don't we? Have we forgotten about the unbanked? I'm in a major city (USA) with a capped broadband connection, and I can't run a full node 24/7 in default settings as it is. Ideally, I would have margin well above my residential connection's bandwidth limits; this suggests that it's already an issue for node operators in developed regions -- let alone undeveloped regions.
It's best to assume that a node operator will never sacrifice their other internet activities (gaming, streaming, torrenting, video-conferencing, etc) either...they are likely to simply shut down their node. I know from experience. Things like maxuploadtarget and blocksonly help a lot -- but most people aren't aware of them, and will simply shut down when their limited resources are eaten through. We need to stay as far away from *actual* limits which will force nodes off the network as possible.

There is nothing wrong with hard forking open source software. The trouble lies in hard forking a consensus ledger. A network split could cause significant confusion, replay attacks, losses for users and custodians. And it could result in multiple blockchains, all vying for the title of Bitcoin. Many of us just aren't interested in this scenario, so we oppose attempts to hard fork.
@_date: 2016-09-22 06:28:56


How did you determine this? I generally take a typical transaction to be one input and two outputs. As a standard transaction, thats more like 226 bytes: 
Confirm here: 
They use the median transaction size (226 bytes) to give an average fee of ~ $0.07.
Also, two inputs and two outputs in a standard transaction is generally less than 400 bytes. 373 bytes is typical:

How are they manipulating anything? You cannot force a broad, loosely-defined group of developers to do anything. You are free to fork the code yourself. Sorry we don't see eye-to-eye on technical issues, but you haven't said anything remotely compelling regarding technical matters here. I don't think it's your place to proclaim your opposition "gullible" on that basis. 


I've suggested and provided evidence for past and present spam attacks intended to DOS the network. So on the contrary, the burden is on you to prove that the 1MB limit no longer serves the purpose of being an anti-spam measure.


More people using less capacity = more centralization? How?


I don't think you can provide any compelling evidence that this is happening.
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:14:07


What is your basis for "consensus" if not users opting in to using the software? That is the only basis for consent. You are trying to argue that some people complaining on social media along with a small minority of Bitcoin developers constitutes "consensus." That's despicable on your part. Please keep the discussion honest. 


Good, now how would you measure whether all Bitcoin users agree to do something? You can't. It's completely impossible. 


WTF are you talking about? Consensus? When? How? You are just making things up. 1) Classic only ever had a minority of nodes. 2) Classic only ever had a very small minority of hash power. 3) The vast majority of Bitcoin developers are opposed to Classic and support Core's roadmap. 4) None of this matters, because you could never point to any data that proves "consensus to hard fork" occurred. 


No, that is patently false. Please take some time to research this subject. 2x the data does not propagate across the network in the same amount of time as 1x. See: 


Show me data. How many connected peers are we talking about? Whose residential connections are you talking about--Europe? USA? Australia? Africa? What threshold do we want to set for forcing nodes off the network? Please include ample cushion between actual upload bandwidth limits/caps (including consideration for the expense of high-bandwidth plans) and the threshold, because node operators also use their internet connections for other activities than running nodes. Please also cite your sources, and remember that since you are proposing a change -- and a consensus change, at that -- that the burden is on you to prove it is safe and optimal, and provide data on the network degradation it will cause.

@_date: 2016-09-14 00:07:35
It is a fully validating node. However, it is not a fully *propagating* node, so it can't contribute to network health as much as nodes in default settings. It also trades latency for bandwidth savings.
One of the realities about bandwidth-saving settings in Core is that most people -- no matter how much educating you do -- will not be aware of them / will not use them. Instead, they will simply shut down their node when their node is using too much bandwidth. We need to plan for this.
@_date: 2016-09-14 01:20:29


There aren't good models for this. It's not so simple as "if 51% of nodes are attackers, attack successful." Any given group of nodes has a different risk factor, based on prevalence of honest nodes within a certain number of hops, connectivity/routing considerations. 


The only solution would be to designate "trusted" nodes that you intentionally connect to, rather than random connections.


Well, that's certainly the ideal. SPV is extremely unsafe and trust-based at this time; it is not acceptable to push users into non-validating state for the sake of cheap fees. 


Being unbanked doesn't mean you don't have internet access. The ideal would have been a much, much smaller block size limit that encouraged fully validating/propagating nodes on mobile 3g/4g connections.


But a node is your *only* protection from attackers. Not running a node means you are not benefiting from Bitcoin's security. And running a leeching node means you are not helping network health, and are actually hurting it.

They paid out of funds retained after the hack (unclear whether customer funds or not since they have refused to open their books). Have you seen their volume? They aren't making shit in fees anymore.
This was part of the plan when they decided on the haircut  Make a few paltry payments to show goodwill. At this rate, you will be paid back in 7 years. You really think Bitfinex is going to exist in 7 years? I'd be very surprised if they survive for one year. 
They would be wise to pay in full any creditor that serves them with a statutory demand. I'm guessing that's what they do -- with an NDA. It only takes one angry customer to push Renrenbee/Bitfinex into bankruptcy proceedings in Hong Kong.
Bitfinex is cash poor. If they *needed* to take 10-15% from the lost funds for operating, we know they are cash poor. If they get fleeced with lawsuits and bankruptcy petitions, they will have two choices: 1) Pay in full anyone who asks and start running a fractional reserve. 2) Shut down.

Hard forks are part of *Bitcoin's* design? Don't think so. Source? Satoshi's design was however characterized by forward compatibility -- allowing the system to elegantly accept input intended for a later version of itself. I.e. soft forks. 
Instead of worrying about valid/invalid (network split), we can concern ourselves with standard/non-standard (compatible).


That's what *open source* means. Not Bitcoin, per se. Anybody is free to fork open source code. Whether we as the Bitcoin community should embrace the risks of hard forks is another matter entirely.

No way around this. The more value stored on the Bitcoin network, the more likely it is to be attacked -- and the more sophisticated the attacks will get. In general, we as a society need to become much more responsible about info/data security -- this doesn't just apply to Bitcoin.

What's your point? Better, how? By having multiple DOS attacks on the network per week, due to an incredibly large attack surface which is completely unknown in scope? By having the most popular implementation (geth) constantly crash? By the Ethereum Foundation essentially becoming OPEC and dictating gas prices because the protocols inherent weakness against computational DOS attacks? By hard forking to bail out bad investors, and splitting the network in two by doing so? Really, I'm curious as to how ETH is "better" than BTC. 
At the end of the day, you are arguing that Bitcoin is dead, based on market activity. Yet, Bitcoin is up 40% in the past ~4 months and 260% in the past year. Does not compute. 


I was referring to comparing the same period to ETH as if it were meaningful. It is not. Pick any long term period you want. Go back to 2009 if you want. Is BTC bullish or not? 


Why is that meaningful? Generally in hype cycles ("bubbles") the further exuberance runs, the further the correction will fall. 
Technically, if you go back to August 2015, ETH/BTC fell from a high of 50.00 to a low of 0.0022. :P


I'm merely observing that the price is trending up on all long term scales. Weekly, monthly, yearly chart. You claiming the opposite isn't compelling since the data doesn't support it. 


I have been holding fiat for over two weeks since we were in the 620s. I rarely use leverage. This is irrelevant, in any case. 


That's odd. You can't seem to provide evidence that BTC is an a mid/long term downtrend. I'd actually be happy for BTC to crash -- it would create a very high risk/reward accumulation opportunity. BTC tends to snap back from capitulations very hard. Easy money. 


I haven't downvoted you. If you insist, I can provide screenshots. I don't downvote people.

That's interesting because blocks aren't actually full. 




I'll throw that accusation right back at you. You are suggesting that we increase capacity specifically to lower fees. But how could you ever guarantee, then, that volume will actually increase? Blocks aren't even full. How do you know that fee revenue won't simply be abysmal for miners? This is called putting the cart before the horse. 


How do you know? If fees are perpetually low, it may take extremely high volumes to replace fee revenue vs. an active fee market. How can you guarantee those volumes?


To be honest, that sounds okay to me. We are very close to Layer 2 solutions which will enable low fees for trustless off-chain transactions.


No, it was supposed to be released in April. It was. Ensuring it's safe to put in production is another matter. Rigorous testing is rigorous. I am very thankful that Core is so adamant about rigorous analysis and testing prior to putting code into production. Look at Ethereum in comparison: the network is being DOS attacked multiple times from multiple exploits in the past week. 


Referring to us as retards is sure to win us over to your side. I certainly was never in support of a hard fork. Many people wanted a hard fork until they realized that there are unnecessary risks and ethical/philosophical dilemmas involved. People are allowed to change their minds; it is only natural to do so as the implications of the larger debate becomes clearer and people learn the facts. That doesn't make them "retarded."
@_date: 2016-09-22 01:46:07

Unless mass credit card fraud is directly tied to a taxpayer bailout, then no.

They don't choose anything. Random connections in a decentralized network -- that's the basis for trustlessness.

Increasing maxblocksize specifically degrades scalability by allowing more throughput without any scaling mechanisms. 


You have the choice. Go ahead and fork. You're just complaining that most people disagree with you. 


Unanimous? Link me. Votes are irrelevant; you can't poll every user of the software. The vast majority of nodes, miners and developers are running and working on Core. 


I can show you 3 pieces of shit and ask for your favorite. Who cares what the answer is? 


Please elaborate. I am inclined to believe the opposite. 


That would only suggest that more people are using less capacity (optimization, efficiency). That doesn't suggest anything about adoption. 


Please show your proof that this is "the best way" with specific reference to data about Bitcoin transactions. 


Low fees can't guarantee adoption. It's a selling point, but I think it's the wrong one. Security is paramount to any concerns over adoption. I am willing to pay for Bitcoin's security. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 06:25:02


LOL, what? "The data we need doesn't exist, therefore we assume there is no risk." What kind of gorilla logic is that?
Sorry, it's never going to be as clear-cut as "a 50% drop in nodes = 50% more likely Sybil attack." Any large drop-off in nodes (all else equal) is likely related to regional (infrastructure) considerations. That means that the risk in a region where node validation is particularly centralized increases &gt; 50%. Well-connected regions, less. We simply do not have the data to quantify nor qualify the risk. That doesn't mean "there is no risk" -- LOL. It means that the burden is on fork proponents to 1) quantify and qualify the risk, and 2) make the case that the security trade-offs are worth it. Instead, fork proponents have done virtually no risk analysis at all. They just say -- as you do -- "we don't care about forcing any number of nodes off the network, nor do we care about countries with below-average broadband infrastructure." Well, that's not very compelling. Those of us who as a rule thumb see security as paramount to other considerations just don't take these half-baked arguments seriously.
Take IC3's paper, for instance. They only looked at *one factor* (propagation effects), with zero regional considerations, meaning the *best case scenario* at 4MB block size is a 10% node drop-off. At 38MB, a 50% node drop-off. You could think of those best case scenarios as roughly increasing the risk of Sybil attacks by 10% and 50%, respectively (if we assume the network is uniform), but since the node drop-offs are regionally concentrated, the risk is likely considerably exacerbated for certain groups of users. This is not about how likely *the entire network* is to be Sybil attacked, but how likely increasingly vulnerable regional clusters of nodes are to be. 
We are talking about things as innocent as feather-forking which (when the network re-aligns) will result in lost funds due to unreliability of confirmations...and things as malicious as state-sponsored Sybil attacks. I know people in this debate are used to thinking about the best case scenarios only -- try the opposite for once. Because Bitcoin needs to be resilient under the worst case scenarios...whether that involves state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters, attacks on internet infrastructure, etc. 
The fact is that node count has been dropping massively for years in inverse correlation to block size. Increased throughput is directly tied to bandwidth consumption. The logical and anecdotal evidence showing increased throughput as a cause for decline in network health is fairly compelling. I myself have shut down in the past due to resource requirements, and still throttle my node for part of every month now. People like you continually repeating that "we don't matter" isn't winning us over to your side.


It seems to me that if you are pushing a hard fork, that you should be answering this question.


Sure. If you connect to enough *honest* nodes. The point of a Sybil attack is to make it appear as if your node is connecting to the Bitcoin network. It is not.


It seems you don't think that Bitcoin is an adversarial environment. Think like an attacker. There are a million reasons to attack the network (or parts of it), particularly the more value is on the line. If you don't think state actors have reason to censor regions, you are out of touch with history. If you don't think miners are incentivized to double spend attack (for example, via Sybil attack), then you are naive. Double spend attacks have occurred, and the incentive to double spend attack doubles with every halving (as potential cost halves against expected reward in an attack). If the value of BTC rises significantly, the incentive to mount more sophisticated attacks also rises significantly. It's time to stop thinking about this as if attacks are irrational or impossible. 


Simply untrue. You are completely out of touch with reality. Mobile phones and 3g/4g have become quite prevalent in the poorest and least developed parts of the world. You're citing reality from 10-20 years ago. And you continue to promote this air of superiority, as if Bitcoin should only be accessible by the richest of countries. You don't seem to understand how that would fundamentally make the system more fragile. 


Everyone who wants to benefit from Bitcoin's security should run a full node. Running an SPV node trusts that the node you connect to is actually validating (and isn't an attacker). Trusting your coins to custodians is another popular option that people choose. 


We can argue all day about what Satoshi's words intended. Satoshi also included payment channels in the original software, but removed them because they were unsafe. Similarly, there is no reason to believe that the current state of SPV was sufficient to characterize as "trustless" -- as the system was intended. Hopefully in the future SPV nodes can be more secure. For now, they are completely trust-based.


If you don't validate your own transactions, what value does Bitcoin provide? You need to trust other people to tell you the state of your money. Blocks containing double spends are perfectly acceptable to SPV nodes -- an SPV node has no idea if it's on a valid blockchain, only that it's on the *longest* chain. Did you read the whitepaper?

@_date: 2016-09-10 00:38:01


This is true. But my understanding is that an issuers' model is generally 1) charge high interest, annual fees and late fees to low-credit customers to 2) subsidize incentives for high-credit customers. This is because low-credit customers need credit no matter what, and high-credit customers will only user credit cards if there are incentives. 
The profit then comes from charging merchant fees, which are extremely high. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 01:44:11


Generally disagree. I prefer to see demand for block space outpace capacity. Fees need to rise considerably to replace block subsidy, if we expect Bitcoin to remain secure in the future. 
Also, Segwit is a significant capacity increase. It will also enable many optimizations, like aggregate signatures, which will provide even more on-chain capacity. 


Go ahead and hard fork. See if anyone cares. I don't oppose anyone opting out of the network and starting a new one. But I do oppose using miners to leverage a network split. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:47:05


How would you know if this is happening? 


Why? Rationally, blocks *should* be full if the transaction volume is there. Miners should be picking up any transactions with non-zero fees, but they are actual enforcing fee policies against spam. Hence, even as we see reports that SPV mining is lessening due to mining code optimizations, we see non-full blocks (not empty, not full) even though there are still thousands of unconfirmed transactions at any given time. 
If you want free/extremely cheap fees, you are going to need to convince miners and nodes to stop enforcing fee policies.
That "peak" in June is very short-term data. There could be any number of reasons the data appears as it does. We are aware of several public "stress tests" intended to DOS attack the network. It's entirely possible that the network has been unrelentingly spammed, and that those attacks are now dwindling down. 
It's also quite possible that wasteful services optimized their code to save on transaction fees. Services and people are probably batching their spends more efficiently. Here's an example of how that works (interestingly in a thread about why blocks aren't full): 


Okay, how would you guarantee that? 


What was promised in the whitepaper other than trustless p2p electronic cash? How does LN not fit that description? LN transactions are technically Bitcoin transactions that can be broadcast to the blockchain at any time to confirm the last channel state. 


Negative. You're citing very old comments. The atmosphere has been considerably more cordial since the July SF miner/dev meetup. If not, please link to a recent source for that comment. Miners certainly haven't "refused" anything since Segwit does not have activation logic in a production release of Core yet. 


That promise was never made by Core. It was made by a handful of individuals, and the promise was that they would code and release something -- not that Core would merge it. 


I disagree. I only see adoption increasing, and the entire world warming up to Bitcoin. I see Core serving Bitcoin to the world on a silver platter. Altcoins are getting pumped and dumped every day. Nothing to see here.

You brought up the market, saying that low exchange volume indicated that "everyone got tired of waiting and moved on." I responded by saying that the ongoing bull market refutes that notion. 
You then deflected, saying that "ETH went up more." WTF does that have to do with Bitcoin dying -- as you assert? That's the point. Bitcoin is in a longterm bull market and made significant recent price gains. I'm interested to know how that indicates that Bitcoin is dying. 
I'm also curious why ETH's 2015 hype cycle is interesting here. Why is it different than BTC's hype cycles in 2011 and 2013? Using your logic, I could easily say "BTC has a much larger market cap -- clearly it is better." But we both know these aren't measures of a protocol's worth. 


Yet you point to the price of ETH, an ICO coin with a significantly smaller market cap, and argue that its price is meaningful here. 


That's odd. I'm regularly far more bearish on Bitcoin than most of the traders I share ideas with, and I very rarely hold my crypto funds 100% in bitcoin. More often than not, my funds are hedged in dollars. I am a trader, not an idealist. 


Care to point to some comments indicative of this? Seems like you're talking out of your ass. 


I buy and sell all the time. What's your point? I merely pointed out that Bitcoin is in a longterm uptrend on weekly, monthly, yearly charts in response to you saying it's dead.

He said it *could* be done that way in response to concerns that the limit couldn't be removed except by hard fork. He didn't indicate that he was necessarily in favor of doing so. In fact, after writing that, he went on to write:




Disagree. By definition, the consensus is status quo. The only measure of consent we have is users affirmatively opting into the network (i.e. agreeing to the network's consensus rules). There is no such thing as "consensus to hard fork" -- there is no possible way to gauge whether 100% of users consent to a hard fork. 


That's a very naive way to view things. You're looking only at download stream needs for one instance. You need to look at upload bandwidth required for *all connected nodes*. And for mining to be decentralized, there needs to be minimal network latencies. And keep in mind that a node operator will never allow their node to interfere with their other activities (streaming, torrenting, gaming, Skyping, etc) -- they'll just shut down their nodes. We need to limit upload bandwidth requirements well beyond the literal limit of residential connections.

I see nothing in those links that suggests a general consensus at all. 


No. The reason fork proponents have co-opted the word "scaling" is to deceive people into thinking that's what a block size limit increase does, knowing that scalability is important in any system. A maxblocksize increase adds nothing to scalability; it degrades it. 


No, it doesn't. It limits the propensity for spam, and it means that users may have to pay higher fees than previously. A block size limit isn't a physical limitation on users---it's a physical limitation on throughput. Personally, I spend much more efficiently than I did a year ago to account for it. And even if I didn't, I'm perfectly happy to pay higher fees. In the future, fees need to replace block subsidy.

There have been dozens of these reports over the past 2 months. Many people are having their accounts emptied.
Kraken needs to remove insecure "security" options. Use one-time 2FA only -- no static bullshit. That's unheard of. And Kraken should be enforcing 2fa **on login, always** rather than allowing attackers to login without 2fa, then disable withdrawal 2fa from the global security settings. This is security snake oil, fooling users into thinking they are safe. **Kraken needs to remove insecure options, or your reputation will only deteriorate further.**
Further, why the hell does Kraken still not do email confirmation for withdrawal? This is the most basic security measure that **every other exchange** employs. Simply telling a customer after the fact that someone withdrew all their money doesn't protect customers in any way.

Huh? Onchain scaling is critical -- but so is doing it in a backward compatible way that doesn't force nodes off the network or centralize mining. The best way to scale onchain throughput is by optimizing transaction size -- for example, by integrating aggregate signatures (which requires Segwit). But indeed, offchain scale is where Bitcoin could really shine as a consumer payment rail. 


What does "inordinately" mean here? Indeed, I think onchain fees should drastically rise, if Bitcoin is to remain secure from a proof-of-work perspective. Block subsidy is dropping very quickly, and fees are not nearly making up the difference. 


How do you figure? What level of fees are you talking about? $1? $10? $20? $100? At any such fee rates, Bitcoin could still be incredibly useful for cross-border money transmission and censorship-free payments. How much does it cost to securely ship a metric ton of gold from US to UK, for instance? 


For long term value storage, data anchored to the blockchain, verifiable public transactions. For transaction cut-through / payment channels (which can be left open long term) for far more minimal fees. This is why payment channels speak to demand for consumer payments. 


On average, they are about 75% full and median fee has been fluctuating between 6 and 9 cents. That is incredibly cheap compared to the actual cost to mine/propagate a confirmed transaction.
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:15:30


It was an extreme example to get the point across. It's a frictionless, cross-border payment method with no censorship. That's invaluable. And whatever fees you are suggesting -- what are you suggesting, anyway? $1 fees? $5? $100? And what is your basis for that? We are currently sitting at 6-10 cents. None of the fee rates mentioned sounds like it is restricted to the 1%. 
And why can't LN be used for electronic cash? They are trustless bitcoin transactions that can broadcast state to the blockchain if necessary. You also don't need to have your private transactions published on the public blockchain -- added privacy bonus.


I think it's disingenuous to suggest that blocks are full when they aren't -- sorry. In the past several months, empty blocks have dropped off considerably as well:  No surprise that users, services and miners alike are optimizing capacity more efficiently than a year or two ago.

In a forward/backward compatible way -- nodes that can't afford the bandwidth need not upgrade in the near term. It should be noted that significant progress has been made in reducing bandwidth spikes for nodes (e.g. compact blocks, blocksonly, maxuploadtarget, etc). 


Uh, no, there is no evidence for that. Proof? How do you know that the peak transaction volume in the summer was not an aberration from the slower, long term trend in transaction growth? The well-publicized stress tests leading into the peak transaction volume during the summer started with spam attacks. How do you know that spammers haven't simply run out of money? How do you know that users and services aren't batching spends more efficiently, creating more capacity for other users? 


That makes us reliant on mass adoption and a rising Bitcoin price. That's not rational. It'd be nice, but let's not rely on that. 


You're right -- maybe it should be significantly lower. That way, we could have a world full of fully validating nodes on 3g phones and ham radios. But that possibility is dead. 
Bitcoin's consensus rules defined its ledger. Now its ledger defines Bitcoin. A hard fork means that Bitcoin would no longer be compatible with its historical blockchain -- for many, that is reason enough to avoid it at all costs.

Oh, didn't realize this was actually user-configurable, just knew that after a certain number of blocks that a node ignores its rules and switches blockchains. 
Well, this is great -- even more opportunity for chain forks. In reality, though, most users will probably stick with the default (tipping control of block size to miners). What's the default setting?
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:34:57


......or a lucky run from a minority. But the real problem here is handing control over throughput capacity to miners in the first place. Throughput cap is the *only* measure the network has to retain node and miner decentralization. 
The recent attacks on Ethereum should make this very clear: We need to minimize the control *other actors* have over what *your node* executes. Bitcoin Unlimited completely removes all control over throughput capacity from node operators and hands it to the miners -- at the peril of node operators. And for no good reason, given the capacity-enhancing options available to us (Segwit and optimizations it enables, LN). 
One might say, *but miners won't publish large blocks because of orphaning risk.* The problem with this approach is two-fold: 
1) As the recent Ethereum attacks make clear, market-based financial disincentives (fees/gas) are not *on their own* enough to deter determined adversaries, and a dynamic limit as we see in Ethereum is not sufficient to pressure fees high enough to make such attacks untenable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, pits attackers against legitimate users *against the hard block size limit*, deterring spam attacks much more effectively by organically increasing fee pressure without the need for band-aid fee policies. More on the necessity of a hard block size limit for fee pressure in this 2014 paper: 
2) Miners may opt to address increased orphaning risk by centralizing, rather than by retaining small blocks. There is no compelling reason why they would choose the latter over the former.

Firstly, the code was supposed to be released at that time. And it was. We have billions of dollars and likely millions of users on a live network. Auditing and testing must be rigorous. 
Secondly, how fast do you think a hard fork could be deployed, without splitting the network? Look at how slowly the userbase voluntarily upgrades -- if you actually expect to remain a cohesive network that can reach consensus, a hard fork would take years to implement. If you look at Satoshi's single post on the subject, he expected nodes not upgrading in a hard fork to be "obsolete" by the time a fork occurred. But 0.8.x sure doesn't look obsolete to me -- and that was 3 years ago. 
Thirdly, how do you measure "consensus" to hard fork? No amount of coin staking, node voting or miner voting can begin to measure what *users* agree to. If your "solution" is simply to let miners decide, then it will be roundly rejected. This is Bitcoin: we do not trust miners. They will attack us if it's rational. They will also harm long-term network health if it means short-term gains and/or squeezing out competition. 


Uh, F2pool was mining Classic shortly after that agreement was made. And they still are today. Further, it was a handful of individuals who have no authority to make decisions for Core. 


Blocks larger than 1MB would be invalid, rejected by the network. Try again.

@_date: 2016-10-10 20:57:45


We don't. Our node software already enforces a throughput limit. What evidence do you have that this limit -- which we have all agreed to by running node software -- is not already too high so as not to harm node and miner decentralization? How do we know that at 1MB limit -- let alone with unlimited throughput -- that fee revenue can ever replace block subsidy? This is a matter of long term network security. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:52:05


No. Throughput limit = the *only* control we have over centralization. Users giving up all control and ceding it to miners -- trusting them not to flood us off the network -- could destroy everything bitcoin stands for (trustlessness via decentralization). This cannot be a market decision. 
Users cannot and do not by and large understand the technical issues: You cannot subject every technical parameter to a "market vote" -- especially consensus parameters, whose removal will cause network splits. That is idiocracy. There must be parts of the protocol that are safe from the tyranny of the majority.

No terms allow for illegal asset conversion, which is what Bitfinex engaged in when they took unaffected assets from some customers and gave them to others (including, presumably, a hefty sum for themselves for a legal slush fund and operating costs). Terms of service do not allow Bitfinex to break the law, and they have broken the law according to any common law country. This is a tort, though, and we probably wouldn't know the details of any litigation for a while. 
On the other hand, issuing unregistered securities to US residents is a felony. And a "debt token" is surely a bond, which is a security. US agencies, too, take several months (at least) to build their cases, so it'll be a while before we hear anything on that front.

Bingo. There is no guarantee that bitcoin will go to the moon, or that mass adoption will bring exponentially more transactions. We need transaction fees to rise. The current cost-per-confirmed-transaction is $1-6 based on the IC3 paper. That is significantly subsidized by the 25btc block subsidy. That subsidy will dwindle *very* fast. Every time subsidy halves, miners have twice the incentive to double spend (all else equal). The risk of loss (cost spent mining in a failed attack) drops in half, making transactions more likely to be worthy of double spending for a rational miners if transaction fees do not begin to cover the lost subsidy.
@_date: 2016-05-11 20:45:38


Yes, the point is that not all members have the same interests. And yet, they rely wholly on trusting one another.


Any majority in a federated consensus mechanism (similar to a majority in proof of work computing power) can double-spend. The majority need not hack anyone; they merely need the majority of stakeholders to agree that one transaction is valid, and another isn't. 


Courts would be powerless to do anything. They are not in a position to determine which spend (of a double-spend) is "valid" according to the contracted rules of the federated network. The very rules of the network indicate that "whatever the majority says, goes."


Yes, that's the point of this thread. I think most of us are pretty tired of hearing about them -- as well as the never-ending "private blockchains have no value" slogan. The point to me is more so "this is irrelevant to us so let's stop talking about it so much."

What makes you think Core will include a hard fork block size increase in a future release? I'm doubting this will happen -- at least until post-Segwit/LN/IBLT/weak blocks. Luke can't even get support for non-contentious changes, let alone a block size increase. 
In the end, consensus prevails. If you can't achieve consensus to change the protocol rules, then Segwit is the only option for a capacity increase in the mid term. Jihan Wu, in that case, may take some fire from the community for blocking the only realistic option for capacity increase. (Personally I don't give a shit about capacity increase, but relative time-lock is pretty exciting)
The other alternative, of course, is the XT route: break consensus and split into multiple blockchains.

Consensus = consensus of all users -- nodes (and miners because they run nodes). The protocol rules underlying bitcoin (e.g. controlled inflation, 21 million coin cap, block size) are established by the software version users run. By running the software, they agree to the consensus rules -- and they defend them. 
So if, for instance, 75% of miners signalled support of a hard fork that inflated the supply cap beyond 21 million, nodes that do not uninstall their software and reinstall the miner's new version will continue enforcing the old consensus; they will fork the majority of miners onto a different blockchain, and if the miners continue mining on that chain, they will establish an altcoin based on bitcoin's ledger. Since block size is a consensus rule that will result in such a hard fork, the block size question is relevant here. 
Point being -- if a mere 75% miner vote (70% with a lucky streak) is all it takes for a hard fork, there is no guarantee that the economy behind bitcoin (nodes and the users that connect to them) will hard fork. The result will be 2 or more disparate blockchains. If miners realize that users are not following and that most have remained on the original blockchain, some may move back. If there is no clear consensus among nodes and miners on what constitutes "bitcoin" in that case, 2+ blockchains will survive and consensus will be broken. 
In other words, "consensus" is linked to the idea that bitcoin is a single, global ledger of value. A hard fork without full consensus (approaching 100% of nodes and miners) threatens that. 
Soft forks don't remove consensus rules. Consensus isn't required, as previously invalid blocks/transactions cannot become valid. Miners can soft fork without any input from the community (that's essentially what soft block size limits were before we approached the hard cap). And that's why updated versions can be backwards compatible with old versions (e.g. non-Segwit nodes). 95% miner vote is a precaution because &lt;50% support for new rules can cause a partition (split blockchain).

At first, it was not clear that the domain was seized. It seemed possible that the Feds might allow for BTC-E to pay the $110mm fine and prohibit US residents, and continue operation.
But now, it seems clear they intended to shut BTC-E down, not just fine them and enforce compliance. In this context, sure, BTC-E can try to reopen on a new domain. But 1) they will be blacklisted by the banks and will no longer be able to transfer USD/EUR. And 2) That kind of target on your back from the Feds? Better to just quietly disappear I think....

Sure, ACH works, based on trust in its central operators. This would replace the likes of FedACH and EPN with a consortium of member banks. At most, it distributes centralized trust to more entities than previously was the case. That doesn't prevent collusion among members against others. 
ACH relies on a central processor to arbitrate any disputes. A federated consensus network relies on the blockchain to settle any disputes. A double spend victim cannot prove on the blockchain his intent, nor the rightful holder of monies. With ACH, the central processor (say, EPN) has all the evidence to provide a court -- particularly where the money was *supposed* to go. Not so on a blockchain.
Take an example from bitcoin, and for the sake of keeping it simple, I'll avoid block race dynamics. I pay Gyft for a gift card through Bitpay. Bitpay (and they still do this) releases the gift card code based on the unconfirmed transaction. I reuse those inputs and send a transaction paying myself, with a higher fee included, successfully double spending against Bitpay. 
Now, in the above example, what are the facts (say, before a court)? *Someone* or *multiple people* who had access to those private keys sent two transactions using the same inputs. Bitpay can only show that they did not receive payment. They cannot prove that the sender committed fraud in any way. It's possible that the double spend was carried out by a miner (Finney attack) rather than the original sender (in the permissioned blockchain case, replace "miner" with "majority of stakeholders"). It's also possible that the original sender =/= the recipient of the gift card, and that many people have access to the same private keys. This is no different than a fraud victim on a permissioned network being unable to provide any blockchain evidence that they were defrauded. Any non-blockchain evidence (documentation of services rendered, IP addresses) can be fabricated by either side. 


The more important question is "what problem does this solve?" It certainly doesn't remove trust from transactions involving fractional-reserve capitalized entities. Does it marginally mitigate reliance on central authorities? Maybe, but it would be more accurate to say it replaces them with others.
To say that "current actors are not (as far as we know) gaming the ACH system" doesn't mean that "relying on the good nature of actors in a permissioned blockchain" is much of an improvement. The only substantive difference presented is the length of clearing delays. 




I say the courts are not in a position to determine which spend (of a double-spend) is "valid" because there is likely no evidence to refute the blockchain. A court literally cannot determine based on a preponderance of evidence one way or the other. Federated consensus, by definition, means consensus of the majority. The fraud victim can cry to the courts all he wants, but he won't have any proof that fraud occurred. Only that he sent money to *someone* for *some reason*, and that he claims it didn't get there. 


The only way that "changing the rules" would work is by shutting down the network to prevent future frauds. It would be quite difficult for a court to definitively verify on the basis of non-blockchain evidence which transaction was intended by the sender. The court cannot merely rely on the sender's word, as that would fully enable fraud on the basis of unverified claims.

When I said "Here's the problem: private blockchains cannot be trustless" the emphasis was on "trustless" and not "blockchains." My original post responded to the notion (see parent) that this applies to "companies who wish to share data in a trustless way."
If blockchains can improve the integrity of internal banking agreements, that's fine -- but 1) the federated nature of them makes this not necessarily true and 2) none of this is relevant to us (end users) because it doesn't change how we interface with, or use anything (money, services, etc).

You don't spend much time on the dev IRC, the mailing list, or reading Github activity/comments, do you? 


It's open source; all pull requests, commits and consensus building are public and open to debate. What is the obsession with building alternative clients? I'm not particularly concerned about compatible alternatives, but this idea that we need incompatible alternatives to split the chain based on some majority voting scheme is an attack on the bedrock of bitcoin (consensus layer). Nobody cares if you fork, but don't try to claim that your chain is "bitcoin" when you've forked an altcoin with an arbitrary majority miner vote.

Okay, well they all follow the same poisson distribution.... This is a matter of optimizing bad miner code. Empty blocks are by and large unnecessary.


Of course there is. There are periods of congestion, sure. But there are also periods where blocks are consistently not full (not empty, but not full). 


How do you know? $10 fees doesn't seem unreasonable to me for highly secure digital gold. For micropayments? Yeah, on-chain transactions are a problem. I'm okay with that. 


Channels can stay open indefinitely. So it would save users quite a lot in fees. 


If SPV wallets were safe, maybe I'd feel differently. At this point, though, retaining full node decentralization is a top priority in my mind.

Who is "the airline?"
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:49:38
Isn't he only charged with laundering the proceeds? I didn't see any charges related to computer intrusion, etc.

I received my money back from Pokerstars and Full Tilt. Why didn't you? Pokerstars covered everything.
I wish that would happen here, like Pokerstars. FBI seized their domains, they paid massive fines, prohibited US customers, repaid all customers and continued operation. Somehow, seems like a real long shot, though.

Who are "they?" If a majority of stakeholders steals from the minority, the minority can only fork onto a different network (e.g. by changing the rules). Since they are using tokens with trusted custodians for $ value (i.e. *someone* at all times is trusted to hold the $ that backs tokens on the network -- this is true for any federated fiat-crypto peg), the minority will lose any claim to $ that they did not have custodial control over. After all, the majority of the federated consensus says the keys are valid, and that the minority is building on an invalid blockchain.
If they don't control 100% of real world bank accounts for which they hold liabilities for on this federated network, they are at risk to lose any and all $ below 100%. 


True, this could be a benefit for banking customers for those transactions which can't be covered by intra-bank transfers. I more so meant bitcoin users than banking customers.

Yes, xBTCe claims that is one part of their partnership -- to provide verification services for BTC-E users. It definitely seems like they have some ties; BTC-E openly advertised them on site. But not clear how connected they really are.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:12:08


How about for unverified users who just had a username, email address and password? 
I remember reading that the IRS was involved in the case due to alleged tax return fraud rings (hacker files victim's tax return and pockets the refund) where the money ended up on BTC-E.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:41:35


Okay, but that's just pure speculation.


BTC-e didn't have low fees. 0.2% on each side. No maker/taker. That's considered high fees.

This was in 2012. Do you think they were even aware that the coins were *stolen* from Gox? They may only have known that the inputs originated there. I'm not sure that Vinnik announced to the owners that he was laundering BTC from an exchange theft.

Many US citizens will be robbed if the US authorities seized funds. And by targeting BTC-E, they've made it likely (since they seem unable to seize funds as yet) that BTC-E will end up robbing their customers. That's the most sensible play for them -- to simply disappear now.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:09:57
What you're saying makes sense. Strangely, the only charges stem from ~2012. It seems very strange that they would execute this arrest/seizure attempt with so little. Usually the Feds like to plaster a seizure page and announce major funds seized. Why is that not the case here? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:01:31


Could you point to some measures to gauge this? Last I checked, not a single major exchange has announced support. And there were only a few hundred enforcing nodes and very little signalling hash power. 
Why are you making these assumptions?
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:00:42
And lenient Feds. I know this is at least partly about money, but even if BTC-E can pony up $110 million, you think the Feds will cut a deal? 
This is all very strange given that the Feds make no mention of seized funds, and there is no seizure page on the BTC-E domains. Are they trying to goad the admins into making a mistake and giving away access to their servers (or their whereabouts)? Or is it actually possible that they would allow BTC-E to pay fines, implement new KYC procedures / prohibit Americans, etc?
I suppose there would be interest in setting up a honeypot.

I think there is much to be debated on that front. But I agree *if* we are hard forking to address patent trolling in the miner manufacturing process, that we should broaden the issue and consider a more centralization-resistant PoW. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:17:11
Then let the status quo prevail. Shrug. No worries here.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:23:57
Using majority hash power to leverage user fear (of remaining on a minority POW chain) is coercion. Surely, users that otherwise would not have compromised their node's consensus rules will do so out of fear of economic loss. This is leveraged entirely by centralized miners and businesses. A hard fork is one thing; a majority miner-induced hard fork is another. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:20:01
Indeed, any fiat transactions out of the exchange required KYC. 
Yes, much of the userbase are legitimate traders. BTC-E was one of the only options with MT4 and PAMM, and had the most reliable API of any exchange on the market today. These are very sad times ... you are much worse off than me, but I am completely crushed by this as well.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:25:31


But how would you ever know? How do you know who hard forks out of legitimate agreement, and who hard forks out of fear of splitting bitcoin and/or remaining on the minority POW chain?
I don't think anyone will seriously run BTC1. Just modify Core.
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:29:18


Consensus is *full* agreement, not a majority. By definition. Consensus in bitcoin and similar networks is based on rules set by nodes, not simple hashpower. 


Did you miss this? "Surely, users that otherwise would not have compromised their node's consensus rules will do so out of fear of economic loss." Google "economic coercion." Miners leveraging hashpower (i.e. users' need for confirmation) to induce users to relax their consensus rules is *precisely* coercion. 
A non-coercive fork would simply be released, and anyone and everyone could simply fork at any time, without pressure from miners.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:44:44
Not entirely clear. xBTCe is definitely trying to distance themselves from the situation, though.
