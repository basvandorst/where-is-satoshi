It's true that the government(s) treat banks and financial service businesses as de facto deputies, but that is within very specific frameworks such as CTR/SAR and KYC/AML protocols.  They aren't just out there running investigations willy nilly all over the place.  Also, when banks seize loot it goes directly to the gov't, not kept by the bank as some btc exchanges do.
@_date: 2016-04-16 18:37:03
why does this seem to happen so often with exchanges?  They decide an account is involved in suspicious activity and instead of just closing the account and returning the btc or fiat they act like they can just keep it. You can refuse service to whomever you choose, but under no circumstances do customer funds just become yours.

Those are all expected and reasonable terms.  And I'm not necessarily saying I've heard of Kraken withholding funds indefinitely without a legal order.  However, it is clear there are exchanges out there that view some customers as a source of revenue, attempting to convert customer funds without due process.  As in: "This guy has engaged in some shady patterns, he probably can't call the authorities, so let's just lock up his funds and see how hard he pushes back."  You must see where people could reasonably fear Kraken was engaging in this type of behavior when taking an inordinate amount of time to investigate and resolve this €35k issue and providing poor communication to the customer along the way.

I don't see how desperation or greed has anything to do with leaving funds in an exchange. Maybe carelessness or sloth, but we don't know if he left them there long, or if the account was frozen immediately.  Well, maybe he mentioned it in the first thread, which I've yet to read.  In any case, I think the point is: don't leave your coins on an exchange any longer than it takes to conduct your business.

You can look at number that represents the alt price in bitcoin converted to dollars, but that doesnt change the fact that in order to buy that alt someone had to use dollars to buy bitcoin first, then the alt.  Fiat flowing into alts will always, at this point in time, have an effect on the price of bitcoin because you have to buy bitcoin to buy an alt.

A variation of this argument pops up all the time.  Functional fiat currency is less than a 50 year experiment. Only since 1971 has the dollar’s value been decoupled from gold.  All other fiat currencies in history ended *poorly*.  Anyone who is paying attention to the levels of debt to GDP and other key statistics will agree that this modern fiat experiment will end even worse because it has managed to become so widespread.  People are going to die when the music stops.  BTC is deflationary in the long run, but inflationary until around 2140.  Is it the exactly perfect amount of inflation to balance sound money with incentives to grow the economy via spending and investment?  Probably not, but it’s absolutely a step in the right direction and gives us more than a century of inflation during which we can work on improving the parameters of the cryptocurrency or basket of cryptos that replace the dollar.  Gold is deflationary in the same way as btc but the economy was doing quite well, with GDP peaking in the 50’s, on a gold backed dollar.  Crypto offers us a way to continue that tradition with fair and transparent rules, creating sound money we can trust for our children’s future.  The lower incentive to spend and invest in a sound money system is far preferable to the malinvestment and reckless spending that exists with the dollar as we know it today.  A lower time preference of consumption will lead to a more civilized society.  Using btc or another cryptocurrecy developed with parameters that may be preferable for economic growth will guarantee a fairer and more prosperous future, just like the path we were already on before the banks subverted the system for their own benefit.

As a former gold bug I often use this metric as well.  Bitcoin shares a remarkable number of features with precious metals, with the added benefits of easy storage and transfer.  There also isn’t the systematic price suppressionof gold in the bitcoin markets.  Yet.  But also keep in mind the long tradition and lore that gold has vs. crypto.  Simply being as useful as gold doesn’t necessarily put them at the same value.  Don’t get me wrong, I fully anticipate crypto surpassing precious metals, just sayin...

Circle has pivoted away from being a btc exchange, thus I doubt they're expending any effort in getting people's bch to them.  Your best bet is probably to google it.  If you get some instructions on how to extract the BCH, consider moving your BTC from that wallet first.  Safer to mess with it without having BTC on the line.

If the US regulators had any hope of banning crypto the time to do it would have been when the Silk Road went down.  At that time most people still didn't know what it was, and public sentiment would have been on their side.  At this point with 200 billion in US dollar value, futures on the cusp of launching, ETFs surely right behind, and serious investor and commercial interest behind it, that ship has sailed.  And even if the US attempted a ban, other countries would take it as an opportunity to become a leader in the future of crypto by becoming a crypto haven.  China's already tried the ban route.  They're a quasi communist country with far more control over the populace and their ban has been a laughing stock.

Do you have any rational analysis that led you to his conclusion, or are you just another simpleton saying it has to crash simply because it’s much higher than it has been in the past?  The way I see it, bitcoin currently has more usefulness than gold, which is a 6 trillion dollar market.  Discount the lack of tradition and the industrial/decorative uses of gold and it’s still 2 trillion.  If that assessment is correct then bitcoin is still grossly undervalued.  But then again, as the protocol improves and becomes more time tested, the market could even be many multiples larger than 2 trillion.  I  assess bitcoin to either be worth nothing, or worth far more than its current value, with the latter being more likely.  One thing people tend to forget is that, unlike traditional assets, bitcoin wasn’t released with an initial price set based on estimated value.  It was essentially released for free and the market has been allowed to discover the price.  Because of this abnormal release it is completely expected that there will be a period of abnormal growth.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:48:20


There are markets around the world discovering the value at any given moment, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 


This isn’t a value of bitcoin.  It merely accounts for the speculative portion of the price at a given moment.  The *value* is in bitcoin as a token providing access to the blockchain, which is in the process of revolutionizing a broad array of formerly centralized, censorable, and costly industries.  


Tell that to any of the growing number of developed nations that regulate is as a currency.  Tell that to any of the developing nations that utilize it as a currency.  Tell that to any of the buyers and sellers of the multi billion dollar dark net markets, not to mention the even larger number of people who use it for legal purchases both online and IRL.  The temporary state of the network, having slow transaction times and large fees, doesn’t change the fact that its practical use as a currency was a foundational property of bitcoin and with layers currently nearing completion it will, again, be a functional currency for small daily purchases.


I’m not even sure where you came up with this.  It’s patently false on it’s face.  The curent market value is near its all time high.  Every day bitcoin is exchanged on dozens of global exchanges for native fiat currencies.  The exchanges’ order books are public to view and the reality of the market dynamics are not remotely close to what you describe here.  Further, if no one was making money, the IRS wouldn’t be taking extreme measures to track down the names of people who have bought and sold cryptocurrencies.  Beyond those making money simply holding or trading bitcoin, there are now hundreds of companies in the ecosystem which would not exist had bitcoin and the blockchain not been invented.


No, he complexity remains the same.  The “difficulty” is increasing.  Those are different concepts.  Even if, for the sake of argument, we were to agree that “complexity” is increasing it would have no discernible impact on the protocol as a whole.

That is not even close to what short trading is.  Short trading is essentially betting the price of an asset will decrease.

This perspective certainly has merit, but what keeps me from selling temporarily and trying to acquire more coins at a lower price on this wave of dumb money is the fact that the real money hasn’t even arrived yet.  Typically in the scenario you are referncing the large funds and institutional investors were in long before the late coming retail investors.  Those whales are still largely on the sidelines and bitcoin has barely scratched the surface of finding potential applications and adoption.  Anyone who’s been on this sub for over a year can clearly see there’s been an influx of people buying for dreams vs the fundamental value of the tech, and I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised to see a 30% correction in the near term, but I’m also not willing to bet my existing coin stash on it.

It's easy to say things like, "hindsight is 20/20" or, "you win some, you lose some," or any of the numerous platitudes that people use when some opportunity has passed by.  However, these don't capture the unique spirit of blowing it when it comes to bitcoin.  This is something I struggle with each day, myself, and have often joked to my wife that I need to start a support group for those of us who've fucked up our bitcoin.  There are those who simply didn't buy in to the hype, but then there is a subset of people, of whom your brother seems to be one, which not only saw the potential of the technology, and felt strongly enough to evangelize the technology, but for whatever reason eventually found themselves missing out on the rewards.  When you find yourself in this group of people it is extremely hard to reconcile your position.  It's rare in life to be able to trace a crossroad of such magnitude to a single decision.  
All that being said, we do not yet know the outcome of this story.  It could still very well be that a handful of bitcoin could change your life.  It could be that it goes to zero next week.  It could be that you find an old hard drive with 10,000 forgotten BTC on it and the newfound wealth destroys you or your family.  Whatever the outcome of the bitcoin story, and whatever it's individual impact is on us, it's nothing to destroy oneself over.

The bitcoin blockchain has utility.  One can not utilize the blockchain without bitcoin.  Bitcoins are finite.  Their value is determined by the basic market forces of supply and demand.  
The *market value* of bitcoin is based on what people’s opinion of its value is at any given time (which, incidentally, is true for any asset), and may have speculation baked in.  The *intrinsic value* of bitcoin is in the size and security of the network and the utility of the blockchain.  You seem to think it should be accessible for free.
“There is no utility to bitcoin outside of usage”
So, in other words, other than using it it has no use?  This statement is contradictory and makes no sense.  You seem to have a rather old world perspective.  Software isn’t designed to have physical use in the real world.  That doesn’t make it any less useful.  In fact, digital tools are arguably bigger levers of progress than physical tools.

IP protection has zero to do with the utility of software and the nuke/EMP argument against bitcoin is tired.  Obviously in the infinitesimally small chance something like that were to occur bitcoin would be wiped out, at least for a time, along with 99.999% of other forms of wealth in the modern world, including all debt and derivatives.  See how far gold gets you in that circumstance, also.  I do keep a few ounces in small denomination gold and silver coins, just in case, but that argument is useless when discussing bitcoin in the modern context.

I’m very familiar with gold and have been a gold bug for many years.  And not paper gold, only physical bullion and numismatics.  Feel free to check my post history to see that just yesterday in a discussion I noted that, while gold and bitcoin share a striking number of features, one major difference between the two is the millennia of tradition and lore that gold comes with.  Elementally they are completely different, but in terms of the modern uses and features as a store of value, means of exchange, and unit of account they are very similar.  There’s a reason that many of the gold shops I visit now also exchange bitcoin.  Their customers find similar utility in both. It is rational to look at the market for gold, the vast majority of which is not used for any of the industrial or decorative applications you list, as a factor in an educated guess at what the possible market of bitcoin could grow to.

As much as I want it to be Hal because he lived in my hometown, I  have come to believe that the most likely candidate is David Kleiman.  Like many others I went through a phase where I just HAD to know who Satoshi actually was.  Kleiman seemed like a long shot at first, but after Craig Wright came out with his botched but close attempt at revealing himself to be Satoshi it clicked for me.  Wright must have helped his friend with the project and, in doing so, he had the ability to link himself to some of those early posts by Satoshi, but what he did not have was the private and PGP keys to prove t once and for all.  Of course I can’t say wth certainty that this is correct, but the evidence is strong enough for me that I did quit looking.  One thing’s for sure: If Satoshi is alive he’s a very special kind of person or group to not touch billions of dollars and to pass on the fame they’ve earned...either that, or they ded.

4. Stock/bond transfer data and account management 
5. Digital file control and management 
Those are just quickly off the top of my head.  The only application I can think of which would be lost if it truly went to ZERO would be remittances and anything that uses bitcoin as a form of reward.  Any use of the blockchain to manage and control data would still be functional.  If it went to zero the companies using it would have to devote their own efforts to mining, but the cost would be negligible because the mining difficulty would plummet.

Except that my early bitcoin purchases played a role in allowing me to retire and move to a beach in Costa Rica in my 30’s, and now I am able to move money between the US and Costa Rica for a fraction of what my banks charge to send wire transfers, and I’m able to maintain my own funds outside the legacy financial system simply, and I’m building a fun game for my kids to play, and maybe other kids will like it also, using the blockchain to easily make it function the way I’d like.  But that’s just me and few ways it has made my life simpler.  The reason people paid me more for it that I paid is because they see ways it can make others’ lives simpler.  And the least useful use case for this tech is as a currency.  Learn or don’t.  I really don’t care.

As far as I’m concerned a hardware wallet is useless if you have to trust the seller.  You can pick up a Ledger Nano off the ground and it’s safe to use after a firmware update.  I imagine Trezor is as safe, too.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:49:31
Not sure what you think I misunderstood.  My point is that if you think you have to worry that a hardware wallet was tampered with then you shouldn’t be entrusting it with your crypto.  You can tamper with mine all you want, but once I download and successfully install new firmware I’m not worried about it.  *Any* supplier can be compromised, be it Walmart, some little crypto specialist, or the manufacturer themselves.  They are engineered so you don’t have to trust the supplier. Well, Ledger is, and I’m assuming Trezor would be also.  I’d find out before I put any value onto one of the their devices.

The notion that the dollar is “backed” by oil is a clumsy way of saying that oil is denominated in dollars thus significantly propping up demand for that currency.  But it’s not tied in any way to the currency, and if there was a global shift and oil was denominated in another currency or a basket of commodities that would have a significant negative impact on dollar value.  The part about gold is just outdated thinking.

Bitcoin isn’t a company and isn’t designed to generate profit directly.  It is a commodity and its value is based on supply and demand.  There are thousands of *companies* using the blockchain to create profitable enterprise using this new tool.  They rely on both bitcoin and he blockchain.  If you think they’ll prefer to use some other blockchain in the future, then you probably assume the value of bitcoin will decrease and you shouldn’t buy it.  If you think there’s value in the most decentralized and secure blockchain on the planet, then you probably would want to secure some of the tokens that allow you to use it by buying bitcoin.  It’s all very simple.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:44:04

No one is swapping out dollars for bitcoin as a national currency.  Cryptocurrencies, for now, are simply a new asset class that offers certain value to certain people.

What’s that?  All I read was “fuck, I said some shit I don’t have any clue about so to protect my fragile ego instead of taking the time to learn I’ll say ‘lol’ and then say some more retarded shit.”
Normally I make a concerted effort to not be a dick online, but that goes out the window when retards insist on pushing bullshit, or an intentional agenda.  But, because I care about this technology, I’ll explain to you what it appears you don’t understand.
“The internet,” as you put it, can not simply be “increased” to match demand.  There are a finite number of routable IP addresses.  Nowadays, these are not even available to anyone but an ISP.  There aren’t enough to go around.  But this doesn’t matter, because ISPs have created second layer solutions to provide retail internet users with the access we use every day.  
Similarly, the bitcoin network can not support the number of people who find it useful or valuable and want to use it directly on chain.  This traffic can be accommodated in numerous ways.  The market will decide exactly which way it occurs, but what is most likely to happen is something very similar to the way IP addresses were expanded which is to have second layer, sidechain groupings of retail users.  Something like the lightening network or Rootstalk.
There’s a possibility that you were also simply implying that there aren’t “enough” bitcoins to go around, which would demonstrate an even greater ignorance of how the protocol works.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you understand the most basic fundamentals and not waste time on this.
If you have something to add or refute, let’s discuss it.  If not, my original comment stands.

I'm happy to give a Cliff's Notes version.
For starters, the author is disingenuous from the outset.  Title says "10 years in" when in reality we're only 9 years in.  That extra year matters even setting aside the fact that it was still many years after it was anonymously dumped onto an obscure mailing list that people began to understand what the technology was.  I think we're looking at more like 5 years, at best, that blockchain tech has been in the hands of the people who will do something with it.  Why the author decided to make this blatant exaggeration is beyond me.
The author ignores or is unaware of innumerable large scale projects currently underway that *are* utilizing distributed ledgers.  From startups to big names like walmart and Microsoft, from municipalities to nation-states such as Dubai, blockchain projects are in development to manage identity verification, real and personal property management, inventory management, transfer of securities, insurance claims, and shit I haven't even heard of.
Probably most glaringly, to me, is his premise that 10 years in the blockchain *should* be doing more.  This technology is a foundational layer for innovation to come. The first internal combustion engine was built in 1806 and it wasn't until 1888 that something like the cars we know of was built, and still another 20 years until the first model T was built in 1908.  Sure, but that's a bygone era, right?  Tech moves more quickly.  TCP/IP was developed in the 70's, but I'm willing to bet it was about 1995 before you went online.  Email has a similar timeline.  By that standard I think we're actually ahead of schedule with blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

Well, when an international wire transfer is $45 and a bitcoin transaction runs $3 I think “ridiculously high” is in the eye of the beholder.  Just to pull money from an ATM my US bank charges $5 and the foreign bank charges the same.  So comparing bitcoin fees to legacy banking fees I think that bitcoin is obviously superior.  And, as you mention, there is a lot of unfulfilled potential, which is to be expected for 9 year old tech.  As soon as we have off chain settlements we’ll be back down into the pennies per transaction range.  The point is, even as unwieldy and rough as the tech is today, it’s highly useful.  Speculation doesn’t come for speculation’s sake...it comes from people who see the potential and extrapolate.

That’s entirely false.  Sure, there can be an infinite number of blockchains, but the breadth and depth of the network is where they derive value.  At the moment, the bitcoin blockchain is the most secured and the most widely used blockchain and thus has the most value.  It has evolved to date to become a very efficient way to complete specific tasks.  Other blockchains exist with different parameters to facilitate different tasks.  The markets decide which are most useful, and the price for the corresponding token to each blockchain is discovered in that manner.  This notion that “the blockchain’s cool but bitcoin sucks” demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology.  For a blockchain to be decentralized it must have a token to ensure miners secure it and to allow users to access it.

Yes, if Wright was, in fact, Satoshi it would be trivial for him to prove it.  This is why it is not possible that he is Satoshi or acted in a leadership role if Satoshi was a group.  Frankly, his personality is so abysmal that I'd actually prefer the mystery never be solved than to learn he was the creator.  
Your comment about Wright potentially being very wealthy from early mining is one of the big rubs for me in this theory.  To buy into this theory is to believe that he did actually play a role in the creation of bitcoin, therefore one would think he'd have an equivalent or similar stash to the Satoshi stash.  Then again, he could be obscuring his holdings due to his tax problems or to avoid claims from any of the people he's apparently defrauded over the years.

I have no problem acknowledging that the timing is where the art meets the science here.  It’s easy to look at a system and predict outcomes, but predicting the timing is something else.  Additionally, mega economies like the US and Japan will be able to coast on credit for longer than expected periods of time simply out of normalcy bias.  This would be where the widows were made.
That all being said, it’s not difficult for me to imagine a credible threat to dollar coming out of the very next large debt crisis.  I think the international community and Americans alike are highly suspicious and skeptical of how the 2008 crisis was band-aided together with stimulus (most of which didn’t actually stimulate anything other than bank profits) and QE.  The collective sentiment seems to be something like, “well, this all smells like complete bullshit, but you’ve kept it going this far so let’s wait and see what happens...”  And what are our options, really? No one want to rock the boat too much because we all *want* to keep plugging away at our familiar lives and taking care of our families.  But the undercurrent of suspicion is there.  China has vocally advocated for oil to be priced in a basket of commodities and currencies, didn’t get much traction so now they’re talking about “compelling” the Saudis to sell in yuan. That’s serious business. In fact, there’s been an awful lot of chatter lately about oil prices in alternate currencies. I submit that the US has used up its passes on debt crises and the next one will be the breaking point.  
On the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, non performing debt was at 4.2% of total.  Since 2015 that number has actually been exceeded at least once.  By some estimates 1 out of every 3 student loans will go into default.  There’s something like $15,000 in debt for every US household and the average American has no savings.  Couple those statistics with anemic GDP and shrinking incomes and something has to give. 
It’s my view that this is an obvious when-not-if situation. American financial leaders can either acknowledge it and devise a return to sound money, or let it unfold naturally and most likely lose the reins of the world economy. What an excellent tool they have in crypto, which is far superior to metals for this job, though admittedly it lacks the tradition of metals.  But crypto being new to the world does give them a perfect excuse to undertake the task without explicitly admitting the depth of the underlying problems that exist.  Meanwhile, the longer they wait, the bigger the explosion when it all goes “BOOM.”

There aren’t hundreds of new companies working today on simpler, more efficient, and thus *cheaper* methods of everything from remittance, to managing insurance policies or property titles, to simple gaming applications because bitcoin is traded.  These companies don’t gain any benefit from the market value of one bitcoin, yet they exist.  In fact, the bitcoin blockchain would be more attractive for some uses if the bitcoin price was lower and the network wasn’t as crowded.  Again, the tradeable market value of a bitcoin is simply a byproduct of this utility.
I’m not interested in what “many people” think about this.  It’s obvious to me and to anyone paying attention that there are unbelievable opportunities to streamline, simplify, and decentralize innumerable industries with this technology.  The intrinsic value is, at least, the cost of the resources the miners devote to securing the network, without which it could not exist.

Agreed.  Provided it's orderly over a long-term period I'd call currency deflation appreciation of value.  You shouldn't have to move your savings into "acceptable" investment vehicles to be rewarded for saving.  Doing so punishes the savers since one man's inflation is another man's capital gains.

Well, the price would increase after the slurry in the markets was mopped up and if word got out what was happening.  I imagine there are principled BTC holders out there that may even hold out for $100k, even $1M per bitcoin down at the end, but, even at that price I don't even need to do the math to know that a handful of individuals could buy it up, and, more likely, it would be a consortium of existing entities that stand to gain who would shave a little off their hookers and blow budget to buy all of bitcoin and bury it forever and ever.

When I think of the ultimate possibilities of Bitcoin, I imagine folks in sub-saharan Africa, deep in South American rain forests, and everywhere else that people are making crafty and cool items that they at best can sell through "fair trade" distributors, setting up their own collectives or companies to bring their products or services directly to the consumer.  With nothing but a smartphone, a craft, and access to shipping, you have an enterprise.  No bank account, paypal verifications, or merchant accounts necessary.  Once that gets rolling jobs will be created organically as those enterprises grow.  It's a beautiful thing and it can happen NOW.

I did a rough calculation based only on adoption of bitcoin at a level equivalent to the people who still hold physical gold.

I think I can close the book on  with the transaction fees that I wasn't aware of.  I knew it would take a long time to get there, also, but if the estimate is that far down the road I'm confident that, in this world, something better will have come along long before my kids have to deal with PI bitcoin.
The problem I keep running into with  is the active commerce part.  I agree with you about the metals manipulation methods, but where bitcoin differs is the market cap.  They control metals price in the most economical fashion for them, but if it posed a fundamental, mortal threat to their monopoly (on) money, they'd come buying bitcoin, just like a hostile takeover of a pubic company.  I have faith in the BTC community and think there could possibly be some who would literally sell at NO price, but even in that situation, what good is a currency that HAS to be hoarded?

If you know anything at all about film distribution you know that sanswork is actually correct here.  The filmmakers chose their content and should have been aware that there would be very little commercial interest for the product.  Smarter move would have been to loaded up on BTC before the release, throw it up on YouTube or take a few grand from Netflix for it, and hope that public awareness and adoption of Bitcoin pays them back through the appreciation of their btc holdings.  As ridiculous as all that sounds, it's more ridiculous to think you're going to make a balance $50k+ budget with this content.

I don't see bitcoin replacing fiat.  It's not an all-or-nothing deal.  It simply provides a much-needed counterpoint to fiat.  Having dual systems will allow choice in the marketplace and disrupt the monopolistic status quo.  It will allow savers who don't like or understand traditional investment vehicles to save without the theft of inflation.  It will also provide essential banking services to under- or non-served populations which will help to spur entrepreneurial ventures by people who formerly had the skills but not the resources to participate in the marketplace.

Awesome.  Thanks a million for taking the time to write all this.  I've tagged you "bitcoin badass".  Very well thought out response, and you brought up some really great issues that I'd like to discuss.
I think what you laid out in your 4-point "coin killer" scenario is logical.  Any disagreements you'll get from me are minor and not worth raising.  I phrased my question poorly when I raised the question of a complete buyout, however.  A well-backed saboteur wouldn't need to buy out 100% of the BTC to render it useless. Owning 10% would probably give you enough clout to cause pandemonium in the markets with sporadic buying and selling.  The store of value component would turn into a casino environment with people hoping to catch these random swings that can't be predicted or explained.  Day-to-day commerce is something I harp on because it's the primary function that differentiates BTC from something like gold or silver.  I REALLY want to see it work day-to-day, as it is heading now, but my feeling is that would be extraordinarily easy to disrupt.
I agree with you wholeheartedly about the chimera factor.  One of the scariest days in my bitcoin experience was when I saw that Citi (IIRC) was trying roll out their own version.  This issue is one driver of my current urgency.
The government reaction/ban issue is the only reason I'm not a bitcoin millionaire.  When I was first told about bitcoin in 2010 I thought it was an amazing idea that would get everyone involved arrested and the concept squashed any day.  I clearly didn't understand it.  I've come to realize that shutting it down is essentially not possible.  Prohibition of the ownership/transfer/use of btc would change the outlook, but would be about as effective as the war on drugs.  In the end, the fact that the gov't might even *want* to shut it down just makes me more aroused.
The encryption cracking problem is something that is so far beyond my comprehension that I've chosen to put my faith in the people and systems that work every day to deal with that.  I have wondered about supercomputers taking over the network, but there again, I'm out of my depth so I trust the network of bitcoin users and developers to solve the problem or warn me ahead of time if they can't and the possibility of it actually happening becomes imminent.
I'll have to google the Gox2.0 issue.  I'm not familiar with it, but from what you wrote I assume it has to do with putting trust in a 3rd party and not a direct bitcoin issue.
51% threat also has me out of my technical comfort zone.  I've read articles, but I clearly need to become more acquainted with the topic.
About a year ago I was up-to-date(ish) on the altcoin community, but I'm sure I'm way out now.  My interest is cryptocurrency is based on wanting my children to grow up in a world that values libertarian ideals, personal responsibility, and sound money.  That being the case, I've mainly put my attention toward bitcoin since it's THE cryptocurrency of today.  It's hard enough to find the time to understand bitcoin, let alone study the whole zoo.  If you could point me toward the categories or styles, and maybe a few specifics to look for, I'd appreciate it.  I only know litecoin, namecoin, and I think there's a dogecoin, but I know very little more than the fact they exist.
You made me lol with your concise assessment of the current danger to bitcoin value.  This, also, has been a barrier to entry for me.  I am a notorious password-loser and un-backed-up-hard-drive-killer.  Somehow this topic comes up all the time in real-life discussions with friends.  Last night my wife asked, "so who do you call if you forget your password?"  I found myself actually being excited by the fact that this answer is "NO ONE!!!! **YOU** get to be in charge".  It's not a bad thing.  It's an ***AWESOME*** thing.  We should all try more of it.  As for the lost bitcoin, would you agree the vast majority of those million coins were either bought and forgotten in the penny days, or stolen an unusable?  By now I'd think people would be taking precautions with their method of storage.  I also see this issue, along with many like it, being solved in the same progression as the net itself.  In '95 I needed to have my buddy come configure everything for me to get on the internet.  Now you buy any device and you're instantly connected.  The bitcoin services industry will evolve to provide solutions for problems like this, but they will all be optional, vs our current system where we all pay for behind-the-curtain services that most of us don't need.
Of everything discussed, this issue you raise about Satoshi's Million are the most thought-provoking.  Much more than my initial questions.  That is one hell of a double-edged sword.  His coins are an extremely effective tool against a hostile takeover event.  They are also the unilateral nuclear self-destruct button.  I have to join with you in the opinion that the minds of Satoshi are nearly above reproach.  I don't think I'd be overstating the case to say that nothing I've personally experienced has made me as hopeful and excited as bitcoin has.  I've been a part of plenty of movements, none of which move much.  Bitcoin *moves* shit.
Thanks again for a measured, complete, and decidedly un-apathetic response.

The first part I'm with you and thanks for that.
The second part I'm mostly with you.  I certainly don't see it as an insurmountable problem, but it is something I need to understand before staking what I intend to on this horse.  Yes, the price would skyrocket, but it would be a one-off event (though it may last for a protracted period of time).  A skyrocketing price due to widespread desire to own and spend bitcoins rather than fiat would be an awesome skyrocket.  A skyrocket due to a hostile takeover would make some people rich, but that's not my interpretation of the bitcoin dream.  A lot of work has been done to stabilize the value and to create a fully functional infrastructure for spending bitcoin.  My view of the perfect cryptocurrency is one where the value increases steadily for those saving or hoarding it, while still maintaining enough stability to allow for day-to-day transactions to take place.  Is there any protection from hostile takeovers, or is it just a situation where if it happens, we hope that the BTC community comes out of it enriched enough to start the process over again with litecoin or similar?  Like SR goes down so 10 more markets gain prominence?

Your novel idea is yet another reason that bitcoin is so amazing.  It enables so many possibilities that don't currently exist, nearly all of which make the world a better place in some way or another.
Looking at how well they already work, just imagine how much *more* effective user-based applications like Waze would work if there was even hope of a financial incentive built into the app.  And the thought of someone getting a little tip at the end of the day for being a courteous driver, and the effect that might have on their driving norms--or more to the point how their reformed moronic driving tendencies would improve *my* driving experience, makes me want to go touch myself.

But let's keep in mind that we live in an alleged representative democracy.  Soooooo, how come mainstream polls have shown the majority of americans to support legalization for at least 3 years now, but still the only real legalization progress is coming via hard-fought voter initiatives vs. coming out of congress and senate?  Who is being represented in this democracy?
Edit to add:  Let's not forget that the Mj tax act was enacted for the benefit of business against the testimony of the AMA and with almost no debate amongst congress.  And the Controlled Substances Act was a political tool enacted in direct opposition to all existing evidence, some of which was directly commissioned by Nixon in an attempt to bolster his position.  He censored data and hid evidence to further his own political career.  After decades of work from maligned activists medical laws began to be enacted, but the DEA still ignored guidance by NIMH and their own administrative law judges.  So again, I'm not really seeing how democracy ruled the day on this issue.  
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:29:53
Guess I shoulda seen that coming...
Short version:  I ran a large dispensary in California for five years.  The kind that paid all taxes, had a permit from the city, paid a fortune for  lawyers to ensure that I was 100% compliant, etc.  The Mayor had toured our collective, law enforcement was welcome inside without a warrant, I was a regular in local news and was featured in a couple of documentaries and the WSJ (my proudest achievement at that time).  A new DA was elected (democrat, I should point out), the next day our warrants were signed, two days later they were executed and I was held on $1 million bail until they released me a week later on my own recognizance, along with my uninvolved wife.  I was indicted on 73 counts of all sorts of crap--I think over 60 of them were money laundering.  In CA it is considered money laundering to deposit more than $5000 per week from "ill gotten gain".  So basically every time I walked into a bank it was another charge.  Mind you, the bank knew explicitly what we were doing.  We were located directly across the street and I'd had bankers in my office numerous times looking to loan me money that I didn't want to borrow.  As a tactical measure/fuck you to the DA prosecuting me I hired her opponent in the election, who she coincidentally fired the day I was arrested.  I figured we had a shared interest in a strong fight.  Unfortunately they also indicted my wife (who never stepped foot in my shop to avoid any problems for her or my children).  The pigs specifically told her she was arrested for leverage since they heard I was a "fighter".  You know, like I believe in the rule of law and will fight to assert my rights under said law.  The reality of the legal system is that I ended up taking a plea to protect her and the 8 employees they arrested and charges as well.  I got ONE felony and 3 months of house arrest.  This pissed the DA off pretty good, so three years later, which was last month, she sent her highest level narc squad to tear my house apart and arrest me AGAIN on trumped up charges that were all dropped within weeks "in the interest of justice".  Not sure how my 5 days in jail fits into that "justice", but much worse things happen to much better people every damn day in this very country.  Though my identity is not a secret on reddit, I don't feel like blatantly doxxing myself, but if you have google and half a care to find more details there was a lot of news coverage and a documentary made about the whole thing.  Afterward the bank, who had the cops crawling through the place asking questions about my deposits and seizing accounts, offered me MORE money to help me through the situation.  So, you know, that wasn't a terrible thing for them to do, but was more an act by the manager of that branch who knew it was some bullshit than a BofA policy.
TL;DR The rule of law means nothing, the devil is all in the details, and buy Bitcoin.

It wouldn't matter which market they bought from.  They all interact constantly irrespective of geographic location.  Prices in one market will adjust almost instantly to the price in another if the market is truly free and efficient.  That being the case, they'd buy from whatever market had inventory to sell.  If I was the one behind it, I'd buy small tranches of bitcoin from numerous markets under numerous accounts to hide my intentions.

@_date: 2014-10-09 16:31:39
I appreciate your healthy skepticism.  I am so in love with the idea and potential we're staring at that I worry I may be blinded to a significant weakness.
1 - Last night I thought this was put to rest, but, as you allude, the transaction fee model may not solve the problem.  I was re-reading the bitcoin myths wiki last night and it specifically states, "there is no coupling between transaction fees and the need for security, so there is less of a guarantee that the amount of mining being performed will be sufficient to maintain the network's security."  
Now, I see this as something to keep in mind, but not a killer by any imagination.  We'll likely see a fix evolve, such as a bitcoin-based business (or group of businesses) that relies on the blockchain enough to offer a private bounty.  I know that at least one altcoin thinks (or thought, my info is dated as I am revisiting this issue now that the price is more attractive) had a solution for this.  Or maybe the reward system in place will work fine when the day comes.  
2 - Your observation is, in my opinion, more aligned with reality than some of the more optimistic views.  Large institutions are never, ever, ever, going to view bitcoin as a potential investment.  It is nothing but a threat, full stop.  Look at how the music studios and MPAA has reacted to p2p filesharing.  We've seen some insane laws and activities arise from the relatively small threat which some argue is actually a benefit.  As huge as they are, they are a pimple on the whale's ass that is the financial system.   And, with zero offense meant to anyone, I think some of the bitcoin community tends to be naive to the nature of how these markets work.  It's not going to look like a buying spree--it would be chaos, with enormous buys and sells with no regard to profit or loss.  No one would ever be able to predict the rise or fall without inside knowledge, so without even owning a majority of the total BTC available they could effectively ruin the store of value.  David vs Goliath is an understatement of exponential proportions.  Whether or not "interested parties" could corner the market remains questionable, but the effect on day-to-day commerce is simple to predict: it dies.  
Edit to change sentence structure for clarity.

Not a terrible argument.  However, I've used that same account to transfer money overseas, make purchases at numerous medical cannabis dispensaries, make very large purchases online (legit items, but very large purchases), and plenty of other transactions that could/probably-should-have been flagged.  $10 for bitcoin on a site with obvious KYC protocols seems to me more like a policy designed for discouragement of Bitcoin adoption than consumer protection.  I entered the last four of my SSN for Chrissake!  Think about your average citizen who has stumbled on their favorite blog or pundit mentioning Bitcoin, so they decide to give it a whirl.  Immediate suspension of their charging privileges will probably cause 25% or more to simply never do it again.  Or at least not until it really, truly starts taking off.  To me this seems like the more likely policy, all things being considered.

Coinbase has an instant purchase option up to a certain, fairly low, dollar amount if you use a debit or credit card.  I think my limit is $750.  They will charge you something like 3% to cover their processing fees, but it's better than 6%.

I don't know how I missed the transaction fees.  I'll have to do some googlin'
Unfortunately I can't get behind your answer for   Banks benefit by controlling the cost and flow of currency and debt.  They have no interest in a competing currency or store of value and have violently opposed even the tiniest offenders of their monopoly.  The coins may be distributed far and wide, but all they have to do is buy everything available in the markets, then suck up whatever else they feel like as it comes into the marketplace due to the price increase that would occur if this type of mass purchasing were to actually happen.  Moreover, what good is bitcoin if it can't be used in commerce?  If a store accepts bitcoin through the normal channels, they will almost all be liquidated in the markets.  There, they can be snapped up again.  Just like one bidder took all of DPR's auctioned coins.  Altcoins could step in here, meaning the IDEA is what would survive, and some other cryptocurrency could quickly step in to replace BTC, but what protects BITCOIN from this event?

I believe the only place we don't see eye-to-eye is the notion that they lied about their intentions.  Most of the emerging products and services for bitcoin come from people that are engaging in their first shot at real-world business.  I don't know the depth of SatoshiLabs' biz experience, so if this is not true for them it would affect my opinion.  Operating under the assumption that they fit into that inexperienced category, I see this as a matter of ideals not being congruous with real-world economic issues.  Namely, they came into this thinking they could engage in the different economic system that you reference and that we both can agree the world needs more of, but financing the project was more difficult than anticipated and they are immediately faced with knockoff competition.  I don't see this as inherently idiotic or nefarious.  Based on the totality of the evidence, I consider it to have been a mistake that they are scrambling to find a middle ground to rectify.

Based on my limited perspective on the current drama, Trezor is a company who overestimated human decency and underestimated the capital required to bring their product to market.  Now their work is being shamelessly pirated.  The notion that open source software will allow new companies or individuals to come along and build improvements to benefit humanity is great, but it isn't realistic, and cloning a product is not a free market function, it's common thievery.  I think if more people here had ever put their life into something to benefit others, and had it stolen within months of introducing it, they might react differently than their posts indicate.  The code is still available to view for security purposes, so really the only argument against what they did comes from a place of wanting their work for free.  
Trezor's actions weren't dishonest, they were predictable.  BWallet's actions from the word go have been dishonest.

My primary point is that I'd trust the original creator over a get-rich-quick hack job since I have to assume that my coins are on-limits as well for their aspirations of riches.  And regardless if SL gave away the *legal* right for others to use their code, it seems to me that blatant cloning and undercutting of the developer should be *shunned* by the community if we hope to see more open source projects in the future.

A couple things pop out at me with this post.  First of all, it would be easy to prove these claims.  In the absence of proof, I'll just assume this is post clowning shitcoins.  Fair enough.
Another thing that caught my eye: 


How exactly do you define "eventually?"  Because this all happened within the past couple of months.  At this point you may as well thin out the worst of your mistakes and just ride the rest out.  Crypto is volatile and it's not outside the realm of possibility that most or all of your losses will be recovered in the next 5-10 years.  I mean, some in that list will go to zero, but others could make up for that.
The idea that anyone would have the urge to buy so much bitcoin, but then decide to put every single bit of it into alts is what I really find most difficult to believe about this post.  That's not a plausible notion.

SEPA is handy if you live in a specific region of the world, but I can tell you from experience that I've saved enormous amounts of time and money on international transfers using Bitcoin.  I moved from the U.S. to Costa Rica and I now conduct almost all of my transactions using Bitcoin in one way or another so I can minimize bank fees.   Rent payment?  Used to be a $45 wire transfer fee on my end, plus another $20 on the recipient's end, while the process took 1-3 days to complete.  Now it's about a buck and happens in minutes.  Taking funds out of the ATM used to cost me nearly $8 per hundred from my bank.  Now using Shift or bitpay I can do it for $3 on whatever the ATM allows me to withdraw.  I could go on.

First of all, debit card is one of the worst ways to buy if you're looking to minimize fees.  The only reason I'd ever use a card is if for some reason I need it right away.  Second, I've never been asked for a transaction fee that wasn't optional.  Third, it's instant.  Some third-party services may require a certain number of confirmations, but the payment is sent instantly.  Not sure who you think "they" is, either.  Seems like you're using a different bitcoin than I am...for real.

Call me old fashioned, but it seems to me that controlling crypto, or any other currencies/commodities, to stem the financing of terror organizations seems like treating the symptom.  The root of the problem is more likely Western tendencies to interfere with sovereign nations to poach natural resources, install puppet governments, and terrorize and kill innocent civilians in the process.  If you don't do terrible shit to people they won't become radicalized and you won't need to impinge on financial freedom to impede terrorism.

Would you like me to outline even more ways that bitcoin saves me money vs the traditional financial system?  Or would you like to continue to base your opinion on what people are telling you you should do?  Perhaps in your region there are mitigating factors that give you fewer options, but from where I sit, along with many others in similar situations, Bitcoin already offers more cost effective options and, as you quoted, are increasingly offering more.  I anticipate I'll be using bitcoin for 90% of my financial dealings by the end of 2017.

There are a thousand reasons I can think of that a hard drive with a significant sum of bitcoin would wind up in a laptop bag at a thrift store.

@_date: 2017-01-15 19:50:09
When you buy bitcoin you are casting your vote to affirm that it is something of value.  When you hold bitcoin you are participating in bitcoin's designed function to reward savers, whereas fiat punishes savers through inflation.  However, from a traditional capitalist perspective you're sinning against the economy by letting that value sit idle.  Personally I don't see a problem with that as I believe Bitcoin does benefit in this nascent stage by having holders to offset volatility caused by traders.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:47:14

I'm living outside my native U.S. mainly using Bitcoin debit cards and I am saving money overall.  Early this month got a little tricky with all the fluctuations, but as you say, I just said fuckit, gotta live with my convictions, and went on as if there was no volatility.

How do you figure?  Last I checked you still couldn't use any traditional financial institutions to turn your mobile phone into a merchant and/or savings account in rural Guatamala (to pick one example).  Further, the fees are usually zero or optional, particularly for small transactions.  Even if there is a nominal fee you do realize that merchants are passing the 1-5% fees charged when they accept credit/debit card payments are passed on to you in the price of the product or service, don't you?
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:10:04
I'm guessing it has something to do with the lack of a chip on the bitpay card.  I've used my bitpay card all over Central America and in the US and the only time I've ever had a problem is with a small handful of places that only accept cards with the chip.

While I don't agree with the statement, I do agree with the sentiment.  When my friends tell me they think it's too late to buy I just ask them how many people they know who own bitcoin.

When I'm standing in front of an ATM and need to transfer bitcoin from an outside wallet to bitpay or coinbase, I can see the transfer instantly, and I can withdraw the funds within 5-10 minutes.  I was clear in my previous post that there is a gap between receipt and availability.  And even with that gap, 10 minutes vs 24 hours or more using traditional systems feels instant to me.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:43:16
I assume you are talking about buying from an online seller by depositing cash into someone's account at a bank?  If so, 1) No you don't need to have an account there, 2) The transaction should be complete within an hour or so after you make the deposit, and 3) Without using some form of escrow it is very easy for them to scam you.  You will have the name on the account to work from to try to recover your money, but it would be a long and annoying process.  That said, I've done it before without problems.  If you must go this route vs using an exchange, such as Coinbase, make sure to look closely at the person's reputation in previous trades, and get some verification of their personal details, such as a copy of their state-issued ID which matches the name on the account, before you make the deposit.  And start small.

I don't understand how anyone involved for a year or so would be worried about a 10% correction.  Maybe those involved for a week, but even then...
Maybe consider the way you are framing the discussion.  When I pitch people on bitcoin I never discuss the potential monetary value, only the potential of the technology to decentralize and bring more efficiency to a digital world.  Most of the people I tell about it ignore me or think, "here he goes again."  If everyone you tell "instantly want[s] to jump on board" I suspect you may be leaning more on the potential monetary gain side of the story, which would explain the constant fear when it dips a tad.

Dad has made some good moves and some bad ones.  I bought a little stash of bitcoin back in 2011 because I thought it was interesting.  That stash allowed us to move to Costa Rica.  The bummer was that I converted and spent most of those in the first year we were here, before I sold our house.  My intention was to replenish the original stash ASAP, but in between spending them and selling my house bitcoin jumped a ton so I bought back in between $900-$2200 mostly, plus I have a bit more fiat I was going put into bitcoin when it "dipped."  So, that sucks.  My stack is considerably smaller than what I left with.  But we've spent years living in Costa Rica with no financial stress and if I'm even 10% correct about this technology I'll be able to help my kids' kids live a more free life.  And I'm far from a whale.  Not even a bitcoin minnow.  More like a guppy.

Here's the way I look at it: Bitcoin is either everything so many  brilliant young minds think it is, or its vapor.  Thus, the value of one bitcoin is either well above $100k, or zero.  As long as you keep this in mind and buy crypto with money you can afford to lose, you'll do just fine.

A visit to their "transparency" page reveals that they only claim to have the assets backing the token, not cash. They could be issuing tethers to exchanges for notes, or IOUs, which then back the circulating supply. Meanwhile, as long as everyone treats them as what they are billed to be, they're helping everyone out with a very useful function. This would certainly heap a lot of risk into a small number of hands, and I wouldn't want to mess with it in my trading, but it would be somewhere a scam and legit, and wouldn't necessarily be unmanageable long term.
There may be more info deeper in their ToS that oppose this theory. If so, disregard.

Most real estate has recovered significantly or resumed climbing in value since the 2008 crisis, which was only related tangentially to real estate.  The problem was actually corruption and fraud in mortgage underwriting  coupled with derivatives that created insane and unsustainable amounts of leverage.  Conversely, bitcoin is one of the most transparent and straightforward assets available, and there is probably also less underlying leverage in the crypto market than any asset class on the planet.  Is bitcoin a bubble? Only time will tell.  Does the recent mortgage crisis relate in any way, shape, or form?  Only insomuch as to say that asset bubbles can exist.

That’s not how it works.  There are plenty of scenarios in which real estate can be purchased below market value.  Just like anything else there are wholesale and retail markets for real estate.  Most likely this person bought an REO or distress sale property and had the cash or loan pre-approval to close quickly and without contingencies.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:25:41
I’m not an expert in this field, but I don’t believe I have it mixed up.  The housing crisis didn’t cause the debt crisis, it was the other way around.  If the agreed upon factors of fraud and excessive leverage didn’t exist, the funny money wouldn’t have been created with which to drive the housing market into a bubble.  They are interrelated issues,  but the housing bubble was a direct result of the underlying issues in debt creation more so than vice versa.
If you are aware of previous peaks in bitcoin and refer to them as “bubbles” then we are operating on different definitions of the term.   I consider a bubble to be an unsustainable price increase of an asset, driven primarily by the notion that someone will pay more for it in the future rather than based on the fundamentals of the asset, after which it loses a significant percentage of value and either never recovers, or perhaps takes a significant amount of time to recover.  What I’ve seen in crypto is not bubbles, but a new and volatile market with fundamentals that are still being identified and are based on a huge number of variables, making price discovery difficult and ever evolving.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:23

You make a valid point, but the way seizures are made in practice also lends validity to the other side of the argument.  In a typical seizure, authorities come and search your property, taking anything of substantial value, and simultaneously freeze/seize your bank accounts.  Those seized funds are what is subject to judicial order.  Anything they don't find will not be included.  A judge can't say, "these and any other funds all must be turned over."  Cops turned my life upside down and searched 9 of my properties with metal detectors, but never found my precious metals that ended up paying for my defense and getting my life started again after their bullshit.  It would be different in the case of bankruptcy, child support, or the like, where you are ordered to divulge all of your assets and the court hacks them up as they see fit, but in most cases people are talking about when claiming Bitcoin can't be confiscated they have a point even if they are using improper terminology.

When I say "substance" I mean "what you see is what you get."  It's not hard to understand the basics of crypto, but it is difficult to cull accurate and relevant info about a stock.  And once you've paid for access to said info, there's still a subjective decision to be made.  We can certainly agree that the stock market in theory has underlying substance.  
Long term capital gains rates attract vast amounts of capital to the stock market, and are obviously not relegated only to that asset class, but with other sectors still recovering from demonstrable bubbles stocks are likely attracting a disproportionate amount of capital.  If I want to put my cash into gold or silver (physical, not paper), or collectibles I get nicked an additional 10%.  I view this as a penalty tax for not playing the game the way I'm supposed to.
Personally I do invest in real estate, but that, along with your other suggestions, is an investment.  There are a huge number of people who don't have the time or sophistication to participate in those markets and they're all penalized for it.  I don't see crypto supplanting fiat, but I do see it as a parralel option that can compete to some extent with fiat, and bring a small bit of accountability to those pulling the strings.
I may be jumping a few steps ahead in my view of Bitcoin, but I see the potential and knowingly choose to treat it as what it is designed to be instead of what it is today.  We're in a phase of adoption that requires this of some "believers," and it also is being helped along by speculators as you seem to be.  
I don't think I push any particular premise about Bitcoin.  I moved outside the states and I find it to be very useful in moving money cheaply across borders; as a merchant I think the idea of being able to potentially save 3% on CC processing fees is awesome; as a libertarian I love the idea of a permissionless currency; and as a critic of the legacy financial system I think it would be great if there was an asset that let people opt out of inflationary fiat.  I vote with my dollars and I hope that it turns out to mean something better for my kids.  I would never advocate someone *invest* in crypto if they didn't share my ideals.  Some here do, but anyone who buys crypto based on strangers' advice online kinda deserves to lose their money.

People have been dealing with the issue of high electrical use growing cannabis indoors for decades.  What being illegal did, which was kinda cool, was limit the size of each grow room.  The result was 50,000 people making a very good living, vs 5 people making a fortune.  The worst thing that happened to growers was legalization, so I'm not overly concerned about how this China stuff will impact Bitcoin.

Fiat doesn't mean "backed by nothing" or "no intrinsic value."  It literally means "order" or "decree."  Beads, seashells, or anything else with no intrinsic value that is or was used as currency naturally by market participants is not considered a fiat currency.  It  literally has to be created and deemed a currency by the government.

Bitcoin ATMs have high fees.   We know this.  But it's a function of competition, not any failure of the protocol.  When the market matures they won't charge much more than an exchange.

I don't think Bitcoin will always be as volatile as it is now.  At some time in the future I think it will stabilize to a point where it appreciates at roughly the annual inflation rate now.  And I spend it on things that I want or need, just as I spend dollars on now.  Even those of us who complain about inflationary currency aren't out trying to spend as fast as possible to beat inflation, and I don't think the reverse would be true, either.  If anything it would have a marginal effect in stifling overall consumption, which personally I think makes for a healthier society.

Unlike the traditional banking system, your bitcoin is safe in your wallet until you are persuaded to hand it over.  They can not simply provide a court order and seize your bitcoin like a bank would.  However, this only goes for a wallet you hold personally.  If it is on an exchange or somewhere else that holds the private keys it is only safe until that party is persuaded to access the funds.

If it was the Coinbase account that would close when you tried to link the WF account it sounds like it may be tripping some kind of issue on the Coinbase side.  Or maybe I'm just misunderstanding.  In any case, Coinbase is shy about explaining any of their decisions or glitches.  Hopefully you have better luck with Kraken and Gemini than I did.  Kraken kicked back all of my attempted wire transfers, and I've been waiting on ID verification by Gemini since May.  My only alternative to Coinbase has been bitstamp, which costs extra to wire funds to because the wire is international.

They are two totally different things.  I don't think Bitpay even offers an exchange.  Coinbase is an exchange where you can buy bitcoin, Ethereum, and lite coin.  Bitpay is a bitcoin merchant services company whose service allows you to accept bitcoin without volatility risk.  They both offer wallets and debit cards, but I've never heard of anyone using the Bitpay wallet so I assume it's not got anything special going for it.  The fees on both debit cards were the same last I checked, but with the Bitpay card you have to pre-load it so however much you load is converted to dollars all at the one time, while the Shift card from Coinbase debits the corresponding amount of the purchase directly from your BTC wallet.

No one can argue against the fact that fractional reserve banking and debt based currency controlled by a central bank creates a robust economy.  The problem with that is the unsustainable level of consumption required to fuel the system.  It's all based on a shale foundation.  Some aspects of life may be more difficult in a sound money system,  but we'll find solutions for 90% of those problems once we are in a system with a strong foundation.

I don't think they were literally saying the entire stock market is a ponzi scheme, just that between the two there is less underlying substance in the stock market.  I tend to agree.  Stocks in the Us are propped up by tax breaks and inflationary currency, and the valuations of the companies have been growing to higher and higher multiples that wouldn't seem rational to an analyst from 20 years ago, but the fact that someone will come along and pay more for it keeps the merry-go-round turning.  Personally, I don't know what will happen in the future, but I really like having cryptocurrency around as an option.  If I just want to save money and not worry about inflation, I can buy Bitcoin and call it a day.

You realize how dumb this makes you look, right?  Goldman is recommending their clients BUY Bitcoin.  To say Bitcoin will just continue going up unimpeded is ridiculous.  Markets correct along the way, regardless of their overall trajectory.  She is using technical analysis to predict that there will be a large correction before it hits $5000, but will recover and continue its bull run.  And it's worth noting that her last prediction was as on the money as predictions get.  I don't believe in TA, but anyone familiar with bitcoin's behavior can attest that this prediction makes a lot of sense.  Whether or not it happens we'll have to just wait and see.

It could be something in between a scam and legit. I don't know much about or use Tether, but it seems to me that it serves a useful purpose in the crypto ecosystem, even if it beggars belief to image they legitimately have a pile of cash sitting idle somewhere as backing for this token. A visit to their "transparency" page reveals that they only claim to have the assets backing the token, not cash. They could be issuing tethers to exchanges for notes, or IOUs, which then back the circulating supply. Meanwhile, as long as everyone treats them as what they are billed to be, they're helping everyone out with a very useful function. This would certainly heap a lot of risk into a small number of hands, and I wouldn't want to mess with it in my trading, but it would be somewhere between the two extremes and wouldn't necessarily be unmanageable long term.
There may be more info deeper in their ToS that oppose this theory. If so, disregard.

I'd sleep just fine at night under those circumstances.  And if you did any amount of research you're aware that, aside from a handful of capers, they don't get broken into.  Your real risk is bank error (also highly unlikely) or a government agency accessing it via court order.  If the latter is something applicable to you, obviously act accordingly.  But given the fact that in OP's scenario this is where you are storing a *backup* of your seed it's a near zero chance of failure.  I can think up a scenario for every backup storage scheme to fail, but according to real life odds I'd bet money that a safe deposit box is your most secure option.

You can still use Coinbase, though I do think you'll be saddled with limits.  What you want to do is transfer the funds from your USD wallet on CB into their GDAX exchange.  With limit orders you'll pay zero fees.  Might be good to good to have those weekly purchase limits, but if you want to just go all in at once I'd go with Gemini, Kraken, or Bitstamp.  All have relatively low fees and you can just wire the money in and go.

Not really.  They have reporting requirements and they have to collect certain information, but they aren’t liable for customer behavior as long as they’ve followed these AML/KYC rules and reported suspicious or large cash transactions.

You're fine as long as you realize there is a slim chance that you can lose your funds if Coinbase is the most elaborate exit scam of all time.

I assume they will if it is of any value.  With the BCH fork it was a snap to receive the coins.  I don't know that their wallet will be of use to actually hold the new coin, but they will almost certainly release instructions for how to send them somewhere that will.

My intention was to pick on you a bit to try to get to the bottom of this attitude I often see on this sub.  This thing about people being oddly judgemental of others’ financial decisions.  It strikes me as odd primarily because it’s common sense not to take out loans to buy crypto or to put every last cent into it, yet there is an entire subset of posters who seem to take it very personally and expend a great deal of energy opposing it.  Bitcoin being a technology that is, to a great extent, about freedom it is a head scratcher to me why some people care so much.

That's a totally separate issue.  I don't remember the details, but long ago it was declared to be illegal to conduct cash for bitcoin transactions in the U.S. without registering as a MSB.  This includes trading cash for bitcoin with friends and family.

I've heard tell of Coinbase shutting down accounts with no explanation too many times.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, as one would think they'd want to be clear about the reasons so people can more effectively stop it from happening to them.  I think what it boils down to is Coinbase employing an abundance of caution in an effort to remain far from possible accusations of violating AML/KYC laws and other regulations pertaining to money transmitting services.  It's a bummer that you paid the price, though.  I'd be really disappointed if they closed my account.  I use it every day.

Well that explains why there is so much misinformation about bitcoin in the media.  Not that I believe you.  You've been moving the goalpost on what you're claiming for the entire thread, but now it at least sounds like you capitulate that one must be registered as a MSB (you can't "have an MSB," by the way).  So, as to your claim that you can do one time exchanges under $5k (which wasn't your initial claim, but whatever), See the item in bold in this quote from the definition of a MSB on FinCen's website.:
"The term "money services business" includes any person doing business, **whether or not on a regular basis** or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:
(1) Currency dealer or exchanger. 
(2) Check casher. 
(3) Issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value. 
(4) Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value. 
(5) Money transmitter.
(6) U.S. Postal Service."
If I'm wrong it would be trivial to provide a link to a resource demonstrating my error.  In fact, I thought they did set some threshold under which a one time transaction is allowed, similar to the C$3,000 threshold in Canada, but it isn't $5,000.  What, you don't have the time?  Too busy spewing bullshit to the entirety of the crypto community?

The article fails to mention, however, why that means I can't sell from outside South Korea to someone inside SK using some other payment method, such as PayPal or a Visa/MC merchant account.  Basically, shitty english aside, this quote makes zero sense:


A) If one is trying to sell bitcoin within SK, why do it on an exchange, and
B) Why would one need a SK bank account either way?  I find it hard to believe they are more inquisitive than the US gov't regarding wire transfers or CC purchases.
C) My original point was that assuming one does need a SK bank account to sell btc to a SK national from outside SK for some poorly explained reason, one could simply physically go there and sell for cash.

In the US, undocumented workers are paid with check more often than not.  It's the source of major complaints from advocacy groups because they are having taxes withheld that they'll never benefit from.  Also, an employer would be stupid to pay in cash because then you lose deniability of the knowledge that the person was undocumented.  I'm sure I have several illegals working for me, but I didn't verify the accuracy of their documents because that ain't my responsibility.  They get paid in check like everyone else.
Bad credit will absolutely proclude one from obtaining a bank account.  In the US there are services, such as Chex Systems, that will alert the bank (or retailers) to bad checks you have written in the past.  If you come up in that system as having passed bad checks you won't be given an account at most banks.

See, the way I read this is "TA is a crapshoot, so the guys who are most successful at it are the ones who also check the fundamentals."
Honestly, though, I don't have any problem with traders, regardless of the methods they use.  A lot of this type of investing is luck anyhow, and isn't much different from gambling except that when markets are tending upwards it gives the trader/investor an advantage whereas in straight gambling the house has the advantage.  My only real problem with TA is the guys selling it.  You want to use it with your own money, go right ahead.

This is flat out bullshit.  The maximum fee is 4% and even if you are buying only $100 using your bank account the fee is 2.99.  If you want to pay even less just go to their GDAX exchange and set a limit order and you won't pay any fee at all.

Zero fee for the maker, .1-.25% for the taker, depending on your monthly volume, so way less costly than their normal 1.5%.  Though I think buy prices on GDAX are also closer to the actual market rate.  Meaning, at the moment Coinbase's stated market rate for BTC/USD is 2142.15, but if I try to buy it is at a rate of 2152.85;sell is 2131.15.  On GDAX I think the buy would be closer to 2142.15.

@_date: 2017-05-27 17:21:38
Typically I invest in my own ventures, but when I have excess cash I look for projects that are run by people I believe in and trust.  When I used to invest in stocks I'd look at their financials and financial ratios, management team, industry outlook, etc.  The problem is that on a large scale there's too many ways to manipulate those factors, and I simply don't believe in them any more.  
Now, if I'm correctly reading between the lines of your comment, you are a fan of technical analysis.  Whether that is true or not, forgive me for the following rant.  If TA was a functional science, there would be people who have mastered it and are rarely, if ever, wrong. Who is the Warren Buffet of TA?  No one.  Because it's bullshit.  Another thing about TA is how can one expect it to beat these high frequency trading firms using supercomputers and digging holes through mountains to get an edge when executing their trades?  You think you can identify a pattern before a proprietary algorithm running on a supercomputer?  So, even if it was functional science it still wouldn't work in practice.  TA is a pseudoscience that only consistently makes money for people who are selling it.
The one concession I'd give a TA based trader in bitcoin is that there are enough unsophisticated investors in the bitcoin space using TA that there is a slim possibility that it works slightly as a self fulfilling prophesy.  Enough numbskulls think a chart is going a certain way can actually make the chart go that way.  IF that is true (big "if") then enjoy it while it lasts, because as soon as the bitcoin market matures that's all gone.
When it comes to bitcoin, the best factors to look for are supply--mining issues, halvings, quality of exchanges--and demand--surrounding tech, new use cases, geopolitical issues, regulatory moves, and overall adoption.

Their GDAX exchange is dirt cheap.  0% fee for makers, .25% or less for takers.  Their coinbase wallet/exchange service is more costly, but often worth it because they lock your price in immediately, whereas with GDAX you have to fund your account before placing an order.

It truly doesn't end.  Two things that I want to clarify:

2) As far as wall street stocks go I don't think true fundamental analysis is even possible.  Too much funny business with the accounting, the ratings, the press releases, etc.  Unless you have inside info that average Joe can never dream of having, you can't make a truly educated decision.  In that realm I think TA and FA are basically the same--methods to make ourselves feel confident about decisions that are glorified coin tosses.

A decent translation by Google:
For a long time, bitcoins were considered to be a game money for nerds and cybercriminals, but the financial sector is now taking the crypto currency seriously. With their help, not only can transfers be made, for many it is also interesting as a speculative financial investment.
Those who bought a Bitcoin in May 2015 at the price of about 200 euros at that time can currently look forward to the increase in their capital. At the beginning of March, a bitcoin was worth more than a fine gold. Despite all the losses and the high volatility, more and more people will therefore be investing in Bitcoin (BTC).
Only: How does it actually work? Beginners need first a so-called wallet, thus a virtual Brieftasche. Behind it lies a software, which exists for all operating systems and platforms. With the wallet you can send and receive bitcoins. One of the Bitcoin marketplaces on the net is the currency. Investors must register and deposit their account data; Some providers also allow the Bitcoin purchase by credit card.
The choice of the market place requires care and confidence. Because these companies can be banned or hacked - both have already happened. In Germany, bitcoin.de is the leader, with regular security audits. There, BTC owners offer their bitcoins as at Ebay at a certain price, the marketplace itself takes a transaction fee.
If the purchase price is transferred to the seller's account and the recipient confirms this, the purchased bitcoins will migrate to the wallet. As an alternative, one can also gain first-hand experiences with the crypt diet - at local Bitcoin meetings, for example, in many cities. According to statistics from Statista, there are about 1150 bitcoin ATMs - most in the US; Germany is still Diaspora.

I agree with everything he says, however I don't agree with how he presented it.  From my experience working with state authorities and regulators in regard to medical cannabis I learned that there is a language of diplomacy that allows one to maintain their personal integrity, but also use words and terminology that are less caustic to the ears of authority.  Being right does not matter with these bastards, you have to serve it up palatably or they turn off.

I absolutely believe they can scale appropriately by now, and I'm dumbfounded at their level of sucking lately.  But I honestly don't think they do it on purpose.  To tank your service to somehow take advantage of price movement vs collecting fees off every transaction by a vastly growing customer base would be unbelievably short sighted.  Whatever the reason, if I was an investor I'd be livid.  Im pissed enough just as a customer.

I'm not sure why people object so much to this comparison.  At least in the context of strictly comparing relative interest it makes sense to say that the number of dollars used to buy bitcoin is such-n-such vs the number of dollars used to buy (insert stock/commodity/etc).  It's not as if OP is using these values to predict price or anything.  It's more like saying, "I saw a dog the size of a house!"  No one is implying a relationship between dogs and houses, other than relative size.
@_date: 2017-05-14 05:00:13
That wouldn't explain why they closed the first one, but the wording leads to me to believe it wasn't as on the up-and-up as OP claims.  If these were just normal, run-of-the-mill accounts it wouldn't take a keen eye to notice as they'd both be under the same name/address/SSN/etc.

While it is true that some in the bitcoin arena, particularly the sub, have a sophomoric understanding of economics, the fact is that the economic principles the technology is built on are absolutely sound.  They are very different from what contemporary western economists learned in school, but that does not invalidate them.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:39:32

Even with the stunning lack of precaution on DPR's part, the vast majority of those coins were not connected to him until his trial was underway, over a year after his arrest.  Cash is easier to trace and harder to conceal than you think.  And that's not taking into account the fact that the whole SR. market would never have been able to function without btc.  The problem you are fixating on is easily solvable by anyone who really wants to, particularly if they are not one of the misted wanted men in America transferring millions of dollars worth of value.

This thread stinks like jealous pussy.  The way I see it, the fundamental cause of this run is nothing like past btc runs, and, while it is obviously risky, OP's move is just as likely to yield massive gains as it is to send him belly up.  These are the bets that fortunes are made (or lost) on every day on Wall St.  And for those saying "don't borrow money to buy btc," or some derivative thereof, learn to read and/or comprehend basic financial concepts before you open your mouth to spew retard everywhere.  Dude's not maxing out his CC's or buying on margin.  He pulled equity from his pad.  If his bet goes sideways his worst case scenario is he sells his house and he's back to square one.  Accessing home equity these days is barely different from tapping into a savings account.  Sure, it's a huge risk, but it sounds like he assessed it prior to jumping in, and I'd bet a Bitcoin that 99% of the naysayers ITT a) don't have $325k in equity to tap, or even a tenth of that, and b) only wish they had the sack to put it all on the line.  Fortune favors the bold.

There has been a philosophical discussion going on since the Silk Road emerged, which has been a continuation of the philosophical discussion that the war on drugs has incited for decades.

My background requires me to support Ulbricht, but what you post here is completely accurate.  Based on my experience, this entire saga has been a clear example of what happens when someone with all the tech smarts and zero of the street smarts finds himself in over his head.  
And all these armchair posters talking about faulty OPSEC would have absolutely, 100000000% have FAILED in an equally spectacular fashion to our alleged DPR.

Not just non-violent, but victimless.  On top of that, the SR marketplace stopped violence from taking place on the streets by moving the drug sales into an anonymous market.  Shit, even the alleged murder-for-hire schemes had no victims coming forward.  Pretty odd reason to lock someone in a cage for a few decades.
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:41:44
Even if he is 100% guilty, it is still a huge reduction in the day-to-day amount of drug market related violence that exists in the status quo.  Add to that that it wasn't necessary, and those actions should be attributed to DPR and not to the operation of the Silk Road.  But people who argue your point know this.  You only lean on the murder plots because you have no other ammunition for your outdated perspectives.

I doubt the bank loaned him the money if his income isn't enough to make the payments.  Typically they'll only look at assets for the reserves and the source of the down payment.  My interpretation of the post is that he made a chunk of money from the appreciation of his bitcoin, and used it for a down payment, but he is making his payments from the same source of income from which he typically pays his monthly housing cost.  I could be wrong, though.

Completely ignores the fact that there are numerous tax and privacy issues that would lead an owner to vest property in an entity, and the transactions still go through banks that serve as the KYC/AML hub for the transaction.

Coinbase has instant buy with a CC, but the fees are even steeper than usual, plus they have fairly low limits; around $700 for most accounts, I think.  You can plan ahead and send money to your USD wallet, or into their GDAX exchange, which enables you to buy and sell right away.  As for an option that lets you go from your bank account to bitcoin immediately?  It'll never happen.  Bitcoin's irreversibility would open them up to far too much fraud.

You're now talking about scenarios in which people are entirely fleeing an item, which is apples and oranges to your original assertion about divergent markets for bitcoin.  I'll make it simpler for you--if a gov't regulates or controls an item that no one wants, no black market will exist.  If a black market does exist, it necessarily will have premiums built in, otherwise people would just buy on the legit market.  The regions you now bring up have spawned black markets for other currencies.

The problem with the gold standard was the surge in population that did require more "money", but rather than peg the money supply to some type of more plentiful commodity or economic activity, we went to a debt based system and put the strings in the hands of self-interested parties.  Bitcoin provides solutions to many of the problems of the gold standard while retaining the benefits.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:45:20


I'd argue that this type of deflation is a natural outcome of the end-game of un-natural credit expansion, and that it was the manipulation of rates and money supply fluctuations that were actually what are horrible for the economy.  The cure may hurt a while, but it doesn't mean the disease is better.

It's a fine line, to be sure, but since a business can't operate without a bank account, there should be some banking access guaranteed to businesses that are legal.  When banks start becoming a tool to limit unpopular industries, such as state legal marijuana distributors, we have a problem.  And it's even more problematic when they collude against bitcoin-related businesses because it could be construed as an attempt to subvert their competition.  These situations aren't a simple right to refuse service scenario, but are more in the arena of discrimination.

Seems to me that if he's directly accused by the government as being the owner or admin of those servers, he should be afforded legal protection from illegally searching them without having to admit to his control of them.

The market has been doing some puzzling things lately.  Some regions are 20-30% higher than avg market price, there is a widening gap in prices amongst varying exchanges, and the gap between the avg market price and the local Bitcoin price has widened.

However, is this $400 gap consistent across many sellers, or the max disparity?

Not sure what your point is or how this applies to my statement, but if you want to talk about bitcoin's role in darknet markets I think it's pretty clear that bitcoin was a major factor in the ability for SR to operate for years, and it continues to allow new operators to run clones.  Ulbricht's arrest had nothing to do with bitcoin, aside from motivating agents who knew DPR had made a fortune using it.

Exactly.  Gold and Bitcoin are the elites of their respective asset classes.  No one gives a shit about the *quantity* of Tenebrix because no one gives a shit about *Tenebrix*.  Comparing the quantity available of gold and Bitcoin is appropriate because the type of person who values those items as assets likely considers them valuable for similar reasons.

The free market will sort that out.  Only a small amount of dumb money will actually equate to inflation.  The rest will go to altcoins to which the market ascribes legitimate value.  Additionally, people can tell the difference between the different cryptocurrencies and will give weight only to those that are deemed valuable.

I'm not necessarily saying the logs are fake, simply that even a cursory glance at the facts offers up alternative theories.  And, having a bit of firsthand knowledge about how these people operate, I simply don't buy it.  It's all to convenient, and they don't go around NOT prosecuting murder-for-hire schemes when they purportedly have the goddam transcripts to prove it.  The fact that those charges were never prosecuted speaks volumes.  Also, since you mention forensic investigation of the logs, a) to my knowledge that was never conducted, and b) maybe it was and is part of the reason he wasn't charged.  Either way, no one died and he wasn't charged, yet he's "known" by some as "that murdery drug lord guy."  These fucks are sure good at what they do.

When I went back to re-stack, and stopped spending them, price was up to about $800 and has been rising quickly ever since, so I'll never have the amount I once had.  No regrets, but I'm a born-again hodler now.

Certainly a fair point, and I agree.  There's a big difference between them notifying me of the problem and requiring some extra precaution before allowing the deposit, vs what they did which is let my wire sit in limbo for 5 days, then tell me I'm shit out of luck only after I inquired about my deposit and went back and forth with support a few times.

If you aren't already signed up with an exchange you're going to be out of luck.  Coinbase can probably get you up and running within about 2 days, but they'll slap a $10k per week limit on you even if you're fully verified.  Gemini or Kraken would be my next two recommendations, but Kraken took 5 days to verify me, and I've been waiting on Gemini since 5/25.  You may need to wait for the next dip.E
Edit to add: You'll also have to add time for the wire to clear with Kraken.  I hear Gemini will let you buy right away, but my most recent wire to Kraken is still pending after I sent it 6/8

I did go all in then, and at levels going back down to $65.  I can't speak to what other people are doing, but what I've been doing is buying what I can afford to, when I can afford to, but I would consider $2000 to be a discount given recent circumstances and I'd dig deeper if we see that level again.

Am I missing something?  Why are we talking about a $5 fee for western union?  Last time I was forced to use it it was like $75 to send $1000.  Plus, they will only send a max of $2500.  Unless they offer some other service I don't know about, bitcoin and WU aren't competing in the same universe.  The cheapest way I know to transfer $75k would be a bank wire, which, at my bank, costs me $10 domestic or $45 international.  Bitcoin FTW again.

Just noticed you say you're moving.  That's actually my situation, too.    I live most of the year in Central America.  So they're basically saying that regardless of our citizenship and our banking that we're not welcome on the exchange.  In any case, best of luck to you in resolving this and with your move.  I'm sure you're anxious about the loot, but I predict after a lot of time, frustration, and difficulty you'll receive your funds.

It's also worth noting that when I moved to CR a few years ago I had over 165 BTC.  I spent a large portion of them to facilitate my move, with the intention of buying them back when I sold my house in the states, but I rented out my place for a few years because it seemed like the prudent thing to do.  I eventually sold and the funds cleared escrow last month.  You don't need the chart in front of you to realize what I did to myself in terms of crypto.  For those of us who believe it has a long way to go, it's impossible to recommend OP retire and blow any portion of a great stack getting set up.  My opinion and experience leads me to strongly recommend he continue life as if nothing happened, barring maybe a few small indulgences, and HODL for another few years.

All rational thoughts, for sure.  But according to their terms of service, even if they inadvertently sent coins with a recent history of use on a DNM, they would close the account but not restrict access to the funds.  I suppose it's early in the situation and we don't know if they are executing a legal order to seize the funds, or if they plan to allow withdrawal.  I certainly don't like the timing of this and their press release about putting what's-her-nuts on their board.
It's worth noting for any Coinbase customers engaged in dubious activity who may be reading this, I'm almost certain that their vault service doesn't allow them to seize your funds even if they have been presented a warrant by law enforcement.  If you must use Coinbase, keep that in mind.

My interest piqued, I went home and started studying up.  The more I learned, the more dumbfounded I was.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but the days of living well on under $2k per month are long gone.  I live nicely, but on $8k/mo in a second world country.  I love to visit Nicaragua because it's about half the price of here in CR.  And I'm not even saying your scenario isn't *possible*.  What I'm saying is that it's not reasonable to expect to retire on $330k worth of crypto at age 22.  The skills a normal person requires to play your scenario out certainly weren't something i had at 22.  And particularly doing something as risking as trading crypto for your income.

Nothing wrong with a paper wallet.  I suppose it depends on how secure you want to be, which might be a function of the value of your crypto holdings.  My issues with paper wallets are 1) They can be easily destroyed by fire or water, or be accidentally thrown away with other paper; and 2) I don't trust myself to effectively air gap my computer while making the wallet.  Someone who is more tech savvy and more responsible with paperwork may well want to save the $100+ bucks you can drop on a hardware wallet.

It was a complete shot in the dark.  We spent all of 10 days here before picking a spot to settle in.  That was August of 2015.  We found a really cool little community on the Nicoya Peninsula and haven't looked back since.  The kids chase monkeys and surf after school each day, and I get to be there to enjoy it all with them instead of at work like I always used to be.

I have this same question.  While the other exchanges are apparently whackin' it to the ID selfie they made me send them, Bitstamp had me verified within about 6 hours.  Then I went to wire money in and it goes to a bank in Slovenia and it made me wonder if it was all too easy for a reason.  But, on the other hand, I've never heard of anyone losing money from that exchange...yet.

3 weeks and counting waiting for Gemini to verify me.  And I'm not alone.  They aren't much better than Coinbase if they can't fucking verify an ID in 3 goddam weeks.  And Coinbase isn't comparable to Gemini--GDAX is, and it's functioning fine.
Bottom line is that I've yet to find an exchange that is perfect all around.  They all have their strong and weak points, even if Coinbase's weak point has become a near deal breaker this past month.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:25:12
It's been discussed in this sub enough that I don't feel the onus is on me to provide a link.  All I can say is that I've seen dozens of anecdotal instances of this happening, and I have been told (though admittedly not personally verified) that it is specifically in Coinbase's ToS that you can't bring in coins from gambling or DNM sites.  And the best part: When they close your account they keep the coins.
The history of specific coins has been a much discussed issue and the led to the creation of several alt coins.

What I would recommend depends on your goals.  I certainly recommend dollar cost averaging your way into a position and then hold--sorry, hodling for the long term on either a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S or Trezor) or cold storage.  The Coinbase vault isn't even out of the question, but get a hardware wallet is really the best advice.  
But the other side of all this is that if you don't want to be committing to hold, as quipped, you need to be sure you get yourself verified on multiple exchanges NOW, and not later in the thick of market movements.  I made the mistake of being loyal to Coinbase, who has been less prepared to scale than Bitcoin itself, resulting in my inability to buy more BTC on dips.  If you don't get your coins off their platform you may even be unable to access them for a period of time.  You want to maintain options, and exchanges are taking about a month on average to verify new accounts.  Get yourself verified on Gemini, Kraken, and a few others for good measure.  You'll have more flexibility to buy or trade dips if you so desire, when Coinbase inevitably fails you.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:43:53
See the issue here is the definition of the term "safe haven."  This analyst seems to be referring to an asset which is relatively stable in regular economic conditions.  I consider a safe haven asset to be one that hedges against economic collapse, or at least great uncertainty.  Even in its nascent state, bitcoin has been a go-to asset in Cyprus, Venezuela, Argentina, India, etc during times of economic uncertainty.  I guess someone has to be the contrarian and this guy just pulled the short straw in the newsroom.

Bitstamp had me verified within 6 hours.  Unfortunately I can't use them to deposit fiat because my bank won't wire funds to a business whose bank is in a different country, but it may work for you.

Seem fraudulent by what standard?  Sure, due to various government regulations they are forced to make some decisions that can be pretty shitty for users, but none of the current major exchanges are known to be fraudulent in any way.  Glitchy, yes, during spikes in user base and trade volume.  Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, Cex.io, are all reputable options.

Agreed. Seems like we're all here with the expectation that bitcoin will make our lives better in one way or another. What we have here is a success story. The reason I'm dug in on his point so deeply is simply a)  There was a time in my own life I thought a quarter mil or so was retirement money.  I was wrong and it's even more expensive to live now.  And b) I happen to live in a place that people regularly come looking for the unicorns and rainbows of a cheap life, and I can attest first hand that it's cheaper &amp; easier to live in many major US cities than in a place like Costa Rica.  Nicaragua, however, you got a shot.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:53:58
What in God's name are you blathering about?  I honestly don't know why you are commenting since you clearly aren't paying attention to the facts.  Their donation address was *not* a coinbase address.  They were transferring money to coinbase to sell for fiat to pay the lawyers.  Most importantly, who said anything about laundering money?  They are accepting donations in bitcoin for Ross' legal defense.  There's the same possibility that any of those coins were laundered as the possibility the dollars in your wallet were laundered.  There's no way Coinbase could possibly know the source of funds, some of which I personally may have donated. 


I don't even know where to start with this gem.  Are you even serious?  If this was their position they may as well just close their business because every single transaction has the same potential to be tangential to illegal activity.  Without due process, you don't just arbitrarily deem something illegal and seize funds.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:24:02
As someone who has tried to be verified on 4 separate exchanges since Coinbase shat the bed a couple of weeks ago, I certainly noticed.  I submitted my docs to Gemini 5/25 and still haven't heard anything.  How hard is it to look at a picture of an ID and go "yep, seems legit, he's in?"  Your friend seems to work for a good place.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:20:46
Your friend either got jacked or didn't tell you the whole story. There is a whole shitload of paperwork--due process--that goes on in the back end to make these thefts "legal."  Most people just don't bother asserting their rights because a) it's a small amount and not worth the trouble, and expense of fighting, b) the property was obtained illegally and they're just glad they aren't being charged. It doesn't make it fair, but there is absolutely a legal procedure required.

For starters, ITT it seems people are throwing around the term "retirement" loosely.  Retirement is surfing all day, not driving for Uber.  Moving on, why are you talking about $700k when the OP is working currently with under half that?  But let's stick with $700k...it's easy to write numbers down and say "look!  Money!!"  Meanwhile, IRL, a 7% return isn't a guarantee of any sort.  I am semi retired and living in Costa Rica, so I'm basically living your pro forma scenario.  I'm making it happen, so I'm not saying it isn't possible, but I also could list a dozen people I know personally who came here with over a million and went home with nothing.  All of them had more money, more life experience, and presumably more marketable skills than the OP at age 22.  Sure, anything's possible, particularly if not *actually* retired but only partially so, but the reality is that OP has a good start, not a retirement fund.

You don't seem to know what the term "due process" means.  It doesn't only apply to criminal proceedings.  If the state wants to exercise civil forfeiture they still must go through the motions: The cops use a warrant or probable cause to take your shit, the DA must then file a notice of forfeiture with the court, then you file a claim opposing forfeiture, there is a hearing, appeal process, etc. that is "due process."  And there is no legal process for a corporation to just seize your shit aside from a narrow set of circumstances where they may hold a lien on property against money you owe them, but that sure as fuck doesn't apply to coinbase.

It would have been 100% legal for you to withdraw in your name, declare the income, and buy whatever you'd like.  What you did is likely to fall under the AML statutes in most states and the federal government.  Definitely illegal in CA.  I'm really confused as to why you thought this was a good idea.  Not judging and frankly like to see people willing to give a finger to the man, but in your stated situation it really makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:13:45
I think that would depend how long you held it.  Personally I treat it essentially as a stock or ETF.  I don't report gains until they are realized, and when I do I classify them as long- or short- term based on the actual time frame for which I held the asset.  I think that's what you were saying. So yeah, I would treat it like a stock, but you won't get the neat and clean statement from your brokerage--you'll have to do it yourself.

As others have said, try the beginners resources here and on youtube.  But here are some quick basics:
1.  Sign up for an exchange.  If you are in the U.S., I recommend Coinbase or Gemini.  Coinbase is the simplest to use and will probably verify you fastest.
2.  Buy a hardware wallet.  Trezor or Ledger are my favorites and both have excellent reputations.  As an alternative, Coinbase's vault service may be good for you if you aren't technologically inclined.
3.  Buy however much you want on the exchange of your choice.  When the purchase is finalized, move your coins to the hardware wallet.
If you follow these simple instructions you will quickly find the answers to the questions I didn't specifically address.  Good luck, and don't forget to write down your recovery seed and keep it safe.  You'll need it if you lose your hardware wallet.

Step 1) Complete 1030
Step 2) Cash out requisite number of bitcoins to mail a check to IRS
Step 3) Mail check and form to IRS

Well done.  Granted there will be sampling issues as others have pointed out, but I'd bet a shiny bitcoin that your figure is much closer to reality than the Feds.

It's not nitpicking, it's an enormous distinction.  An enormous number of items on eBay are stolen, and some are flat out illegal.  That doesn't mean eBay sells stolen property.  Silk Road had the stated mission of bringing value to the world through creating an open yet discreet marketplace (I'm paraphrasing)--users of the site posted all ads.  The bulk of the items were drugs in small, personal use, quantities, but you could also buy an enormous selection of perfectly legal items.  One of the purportedly largest vendors was arrested and released without drug distribution charges because he did not sell anything illegal.  So, yeah, not nitpicking.

Good thing you posted this or no one would have known.  If only there was someplace the price could be publicly monitored.

They will hold them until the outcome of the trial.  If he pleads out, forfeiture of his BTC will be part of the plea.  If he loses, he will forfeit his BTC.  If he wins, the feds will seek civil forfeiture instead of criminal forfeiture and he will lose his BTC.  Once the gov't legally owns the BTC they'll sell it very quickly with little regard for what the dump will do to the market.

I'm just making a good faith, best-guess effort with my CPA to pay what I owe.  I don't trade currency so I'm out of my depth there--are currency gains taxed differently from other asset classes if they've been held long-term?

Or not leave them on an exchange.

Let's report inaccurate facts because if we get too detailed we may report inaccurate facts.  That's as bright as your grammar.

If you were running an international black market and were served well by privacy it would likely not have been the "best decision [you] ever made.  Ironically, however, his roommate may save his ass with the potential alibi reported by Forbes.  On July 4 when DPR was conducting a 5 hour chat interview with Forbes Ross Ulbricht may have been hanging out with his roommate, according the the report.  Pretty badass if it's true!

The bottom line is that you aren't going to be able to treat bitcoin investing like you would treat stock/commodity/currency investing.  You can easily "trade" modern financial instruments looking for those momentary jumps (or drops), using margin, options, and all sorts of other financial magick.  People are working on bringing those opportunities to bitcoin, but unless you are an accredited investor nothing is open to you yet.  And since most of the exchanges are run by inexperienced and undercapitalized operators, even the best of whom would find it hard to plan for some of the bursts in volume and market cap that bitcoin experiences, you run into those problems you mention.  The only way to manage them is to do exactly what you are doing and compare the strengths and weaknesses of each exchange and work within them accordingly.

It's certainly a quandary, but I'd still make the argument that bitcoin has such marginal use as a currency that it should not be taxed as such.  It is more often referred to as a commodity than a currency.

How do you plan to fund your bank if you have 3 BTC to your name?  
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:08:54
Short answer: No.  There was plenty of speculation that Bitcoin would be treated like they treated the various "e-gold" services and Liberty Reserve, and I would have agreed with them (Those services were shut down with force).  However, it appears that the powers that be are embracing bitcoin as of the recent hearings.  But I think that people have really nailed it with the piracy analogy: Even if "they" wanted it dead, they could take certain steps to stifle it, but never kill it.  Napster was easily shut down because it was centralized, whereas bittorrent sites still flourish because they are decentralized.  Similarly, there is no "bitcoin" to shut down.  They can attack exchanges and merchants, thus stifling it, but it will still exist and be as easy or easier to use than it is today.  They could attack the current developers, but it is open source and someone would just take up the task anonymously.  I think the real issue we'll be facing is not them making their own version, but rather taking ours and adding their own bullshit to it (reporting and controls, leverage it using financial products, huge barriers to entry in the bitcoin market through licencing requirements, etc).  I don't think the bitcoin of tomorrow will look the same as today, but it will certainly exist.

Are you joking?  "Grammer" is how idiots spell the word "grammar".  Given the fact that you would have had to push that past your spellcheck I assume you're joking.  I can't tell if you're being ignorant or ironic...

As long as the IRS allows BTC to be held and taxed as a commodity or currency that is fine, but if they try to tax it like gold and silver they can fuck off.  Gold and silver bullion are taxed at "collectible" capital gains rates which are taxed at up to 28% vs 15% for traditional cap gains.

There were no assassination/hit man listings allowed on Silk Road.  It was explicitly prohibited.

Silk Road and DPR did not "sell" or "stock" anything.  It was a marketplace with no rules.  It was much more like eBay than Amazon, with individual sellers maintaining their own wares, NOT Silk Road.  The fact that anything was prohibited shows that DPR had soul.  Freedom Hosting turned a blind eye to child pornography--where's the outrage against them?

That may be so, but how can they classify bitcoin as a collectible?  People don't buy it to collect, they use it in commerce or save/invest in it.  I'd argue, along with everyone who ever existed outside of the IRS, that taxing gold and silver bullion at collectible rates is flat out BULLSHIT and designed to steer investors away from it.  Leaves more for the wealthiest MFer's who all pretend it's crazy to own.

Actually, the reports of $80M are correct.  The reason you are confused is that you're attempting to use conventional mathematics, which is mired in reason.  Using the complex derivative of calculus known as "cop math" $80M is actually a conservative estimate.

No, this is what silk roaders actually believe.  Get over it, bitcoin is useful and has fought it's way into the world economy against ancient attitudes such as your own.

Magical internet money is trading at $560 a unit.  It may not be "mainstream", but it ain't going anywhere.  And anything "cumbersome" about obtaining bitcoin today is not inherent to the technology; it is the result of dealing with a new "product" with an underdeveloped supply chain.
