Yea, there's a major conspiracy. It's not like Bitcoin is a speculative bubble with no real value that got a huge influx of get rich quick people the past week and are now panic selling.
Or that dark net markets have started to abandon it because it's not viable in fees nor privacy. And even if that's just a 25% market share, that's a huge drop. And probably the only fluidity BTC sees.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:56:37
Nah, I've had bitcoins since 2012. Can't do shit with them but trade them in for cash because people are buying them hoping to get rich or buy drugs. Quit doing drugs years ago so all my bitcoins are left over from the original Silk Road and Agora.

You mind if I ask where you're going?
I back packed around Asia for 7 months when I was 25. It was a great growing experience and made me realize a lot of baggage I had or was holding onto.

They shouldn't be investing in crypto currency if they don't understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:57:42
This is fluctuation. When bubbles burst, they do not bounce back in days/weeks. See housing or dot com markets. I'd argue housing markets haven't recovered and it's been a decade.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:25
lol, are you fuckin serious?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:28:33
Not really. Investing in something and following it is just asking for panic sells. Plus, if you were investing in Bitcoin, you probably believed in it up until 3 months ago when it started gathering idiots who thought they'd be able to buy a 500k sports car in few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:47:38
Same, except it's spreading to real life. Family members scoffed at bitcoins years ago, now buying them and telling me they're gonna get rich over night. So frustrating.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:20
Well have fun dude. I'm pretty sure you'll forget about BTC and money anyways when you're there. I know I forgot about BTCs, the Silk Road, careers and hang ups when I went away. I probably should have paid attention to some things cause I had a bit of trouble adjusting when I came home and picked up somewhat of a drug habit to cope, but I grew a ton as a person.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:06:03
Seriously. It has no real value other than people thinking they'll get rich. Speculation bubble.
Other alt coins have application, BTC was for the dark net and now dark net markers are transitioning away.

Joint finances are no hobby bud. People's lives rise and fall on them. My wife's debt is mine and vice versa and quickly drag you down until you feel like you're drowning.

Days not over.

No it's not. Champagne is a grape varietal from the Champagne region in France.

When the bubble pops, it ain't gonna go on the upswing for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:26:38
It's a misspelling but also means hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:46:14
You spent...86 thousand dollars on a speculative currency that all signs were screaming bubble?
I can't tell if you're a genius or a complete idiot. I know you're insane.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:57
Foresight?  I feel like the majority of people in this sub in the past few months have never taken an economics class.

lol seriously.
That post reads like a teenager going "whoa, I'm gonna be soooooo rich, used my moms CC on coin base but she can't even be mad cause I doubled her investment."
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:41:47
Ohhhh, I'm an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:23
No, not everyone. My dumbass sister who bought in at 20k is freaking out and my dumbass father who bought in at 20k is furious with her for con I convincing him to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:44
It's been a year or so since I visited this sub. It's gone down hill.

How is quitting your job to invest in speculative bubbles a viable option? Either you don't have a career or you really hated your job.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:17:05
Doesn't change the fact that other cryptos have more practical value in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:39:18
Jesus, wtf is wrong with you people quitting your jobs?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:26:12
Who gives a shit about people using Bitcoin Cash? Aren't they fundamentally destroying BTC, leading to other cryptos eating up market share? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:19
I don't see anything wrong with people trying to make money but I'm not gonna feel bad for someone who thinks they're gonna get rich by doing nothing and not understanding an investment when they lose it and then complain. Perhaps you shouldn't really invest in something you don't understand.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:49
I'm gonna assume you just graduated college. Enjoy life bud. I'd stay away from crypto currency until you have more of a handle of finances.  Bitcoin is a gamble and almost certainly not going to get you rich.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:56:05
I'm not stopping anyone from doing anything. I can still think someone's an idiot for quitting their job to become a crypto trader. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:03
I don't care, I'm laughing at them. I bought BTCs in 2012, I've held onto them since. They're just looking to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:44:50
Seriously. Who would be happy about that?
What's this?...oh..thanks?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:11:54
Absolutely. This is a very clear example of a speculative bubble. The second BTC becomes a viable currency for goods outside the internet, no government treasury is going to let that happen. People are buying because they're seeing incredible spikes. I have never used any of my 100s of BTCs bought for anything legitimate.
edit: i would like instead of downvotes, people told me what they could spend BTCs on besides drugs and a handful of businesses. i would love to actually know what to do with the 3k that I apparently have right now from leftover darknet transactions that have gone to my electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:08:43
Just illegal drugs and speculation. I have bought and sold BTCs for about 6 years. I'll get downvoted but they have no real value RIGHT NOW.
Hopefully in the future but the price will dramatically decrease in order to get regular folks to understand them and that's not including government crackdowns outside of Asia.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:15:05
Is this serious? Can you tell me legitimate uses for BTC? This is coming from someone who has quite a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:37:17
Itll never be worthless as long as the top online black market keeps accepting it
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:40:59
Ethereum is going to pass BTC. I guarantee it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:34:44
Not legally no but you can buy alot of drugs with it
