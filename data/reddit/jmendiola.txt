1) Infiltrate devs in Core team, slowly but steady
2) Push for a BIP that, based on real benefits, plants the seed for decentralization.
3) Pay a Bitcoin fork team to denunciate this vulnerability on (2) and let them be the only voice against it, put enough money to make them have a relative success, but then slowly kill the project and let them go to oblivion.
4) Exploit (2) in a subtle way, let rumors of censorship grow but do not expose yourself that much.
5) Assume that you can't kill it, but you can take away it's only real value, decentralization. Adoption will not take over the whole world then.
The only way to protect for this, it's learning to code and peer review Bitcoin code in deep.

The ETA for 1 week of December was for Bamboo MainNet Beta, and that was achieved on the 4th. The federated peg is a different milestone in a long time line of different ones.
We applause Core team on their's slow but steady improvement process and achievements but when other organization tries to mimic them we criticizes them and demand immediate delivery? Patience guys. ;)

You should write a smart contract in RSK ( Network with that logic; technically users will receive SmartBitcoins instead, wich is of course "redeemable" to Bitcoin.

I work on the Bitcoin Center in Buenos Aires Argentina (with ~30% pesos anual inflation), 90% of the company are skilled devs and  50% of our software is crypto-related, only myself has Btc, noone else is actually planning to buy. It's not happening guys, still waaaaay too early adapters.

Argentina and Chile just fade away. Perfect, who needs btc in a 50% inflation country.

There are no constraints for buying goods, if it's from outside (in usd) your Bank will charge you the equivalent amount of pesos (at "oficial" rate).It's worth mentioning this mesure is only for fisical persons, not for bussiness thou.

No, he just mentions "cryptocurrencies"
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:31:09
In this context, we (fisical persons) can't buy more than 10k USD per month. Or foreign goods worth that value.

Excelent service! had made a couple of coins myself there. :) Anyhow, it gaves and extra confident to have their office a few stepts away from ours on ARG Bitcoin Center, and share some words from time to time. Grate people behind this start-up, that's what matter at the end.

Yes, you'll need a rsk node, you can actually set up one on the ginger tesnet network they anounced.

I think it's on Jan 18.
