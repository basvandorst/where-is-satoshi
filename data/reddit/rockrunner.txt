OH! No not at all. Doge coin has had decent acceptance for a 2 month old currency but bitcoin is still the foundation of cryptos.

Sure. Identify ones that are about to bubble, ride the train up and sell. I made a killing on mintcoin. I traded some doge to mint early on and started mining it the weekend before it hit 40 satoshi. I tripled the BTC value that I put in it and my GPU mining rig was generating 0.2 BTC per day (double the norm) during the hype. Now Iv sold because I believe it has peaked.

Really? Dogecoin hits front page of reddit. People check out the sub reddit and discover scrypt mining. People do math and determine it's profitable to mine alts. Alt hype starts dying down and people pay more attention to bitcoin.

Only as long as the train is profitable. Right now it is. Some like aurora coin are an impending crash.

I just subscribed this last week. I got started in cryptos and mining thanks to dogecoin. Iv started diversifying my coins into bitcoin and a few other alts. I subscribed here since bitcoin is a leader in crypto coin acceptance and use, and the foundation of most alt coin values.

Is it absolutely clear that funds are gone? Granted, the Gox situation isn't good, but I haven't heard anything official that the BTC stored there is gone. I wouldn't give up hope just yet until it is absolutely official.

He claims bitcoin would be disruptive to the economy. So was the Model-T. And the internet. And cell phones. Every major breakthrough is disruptive to the norm.
