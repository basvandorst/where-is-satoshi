This is exactly what I was assuming was the case, and was confused to realize the controversy here is in reprinting their ad. I thought the issue was that the Bitcoin ad was too derivative in design.

"Write a summary of your favorite book!"
10 Year Old: "Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 1864 *Notes From Underground* is my favorite book due to it's themes of social alienation, struggles with personal insecurity, and it's darkly humorous tone in illustrating life in 19th century St. Petersburg, Russia."
**FAIL!! THIS IS A SHORT STORY!!**
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:39:59
What infuriates me about this, is that a 10 year old wrote a very coherent speech on FINANCE and all the teacher could do was put a giant lazy X through it?
What a bitch. This is ADVANCED subject matter. Do you think any other kid in the class knows what a decentralized currency is? And instead of rewarding THAT aspect - and recognizing his underlying intelligence - she shits on him because of her own uninformed opinion.
It's like saying:
"Write an essay about your favorite color!"
"My favorite color is green. I like it because my favorite tree, the quaking Aspen, has bright green leaves and are all over my parents lake house in Vermont."
**WRONG!!!!!** THE QUAKING ASPEN IS ONLY NATIVE TO THE NORTHWEST YOU IDIOT CHILD!!!
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:59:46
Haha yes, better analogy. I just think it's so crazy the teacher overlooked the obvious intelligence that went into the paper.
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:01:37
I'm wondering why you consider this 100% copied. From a legal perspective.
Different logo, different background color, different stock image, different typefaces, different button color, different message.
What's similar is the composition of elements, creating the parody. But I can't see how this is 100% copied, at all. 
[EDIT] Are you referring to the inclusion of the original WU ad in this Facebook post? That's the 100% unchanged part? My mistake. I couldn't have imagined that was the problem... they're just getting more exposure for that ad... 
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:51:13
Especially since the purpose of these projects at this age level is to develop the ability to organize writing and supplement opinion with supporting statements. 
This is an open ended question for 10 year olds.
He could've said that jet-propelled dogs would be the biggest technological advancement in his future if he had a proper introduction, body, and conclusion. Let the child have an imagination and think outside the box FOR FUCKS SAKE.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:20:19
Just did, thanks. Shitty as hell I have to be like a psycho girlfriend to them to get my money. Bitfloor just lost a lot of respect in my eyes.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:06:49
Because they also have a conflicting message of: "If you purchase now we will ensure the Market Rate of XX/XX/XXXX at 4:47PM." -- Which in my case, was the day after I bought last week, when the price was still low.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:25:47
That is also probably true, but we shall see. In the grand scheme of things, BTC being accepted as a viable payment option will lead to lots of terrible services, in addition to the good ones. Paypal might end up being a terrible service that utilizes BTC, but just them utilizing it means its place has been secured as a significant payment medium.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:51:06
Yeah, the market *needs* someone to step up with a seamless service. I wish I had the backend know-how. I'm a designer, but not a developer... Let alone needing an understanding of how to code for a financial website.
How nice would it be just to go Bank Account -&gt; BTC Wallet. That's it. Exchange is done invisible to the user. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:57:56
I gotta laugh though. The second the price started to drop, HOARDS of people adopted this smug, "Heh, I knew it, losers. Enjoy losing a shitload of money, and then even more once you thought it couldn't get worse... losers."
Everyone needs to STFU. You have no idea what you're talking about -- it's a circle jerk about positivity one day, a circle jerk about 'reality' the next day, and a circle jerk of pessimism the day after that. Everyone is always in agreeance with whatever the popular opinion of the day is.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:14:01
But then you'd be stuck with a bunch of geeky hobbyists sitting on an awesome technology that isn't being utilized to any of its potential. It's like saying, "Well only us who truly appreciate smart phones should be able to use them!" 
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:00:59
It's true, I literally *was* trying to buy shit late last night, and the price was fuckin' me up.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:23:27
Still for real though?
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:43:58
I thought they had ridiculously high minimums? Still, your point is valid.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:11:35
What is
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:26:50
At least Dwolla has many other uses besides strictly Bitcoin. They are much more in the "Paypal" territory - I think banks understand this concept more than say, Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:30:57
Yeah, I definitely understand that... The delay is the 4 day bank transfer from your bank to Dwolla. After that it is all very quick. Best case, just leave money in your Dwolla account. But I liked Bitinstant because if I had unexpected cash on hand, I could just convert it without much thought.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:49:49
Chill bro
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:03:29
Honestly, I think the bubble would have continued to grow a lot higher if it hadn't been for Mt.Gox yesterday. Not saying that's a good thing, but I think we'd still be sitting here with a few more days of crazy increases.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:31:58
Note to self: Sell before next crash. Then buy in the crash aftermath.
Wow, so simple! I should be rich in no time.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:29:07
I *almost* feel bad for Bitfloor. (I really don't, knowing they still owe people money.) They fucked up on two of my orders recently, along with hundreds of other people. They funds came through, but after complications and delays. 
Shortly after, we had our first big DDoS of Mt. Gox and Bitfloor went down. Now they're fucked up again.
Knowing that their "support" is one dude named Roman, this has gotta suck ass for everyone involved. But shit, INVEST IN SOME STAFF.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:21:48
Not yet. Would certainly be nice. For now, Dwolla is okay though. Helps keep me from constantly transferring money. :P
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:27:00
IT WAS JUST SPECULATION
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:44:48
Yeah man, definitely a good call. Good luck to getting a job. Then you can toss some more income back into the system and see how it goes again. :)
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:50:36
Yeah but think of the *hassle* - It's just a lot easier to not do it, ya know?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:23:29
Bitinstant was my first BTC transaction about a month or two ago, and it was totally fine then. I was a little begrudged about the fees, but it was my choice, and the service worked fast.
The last two times I've used it though, there have been delays. Same with Bitfloor -- last two times, delays.
Yeah, the last FOUR transactions I've had have been frought with issues. I'm still generating a small profit which is nice, but its frustrating having your money in limbo between many small organizations that barely had enough staff months ago, let alone right now.
Inspite of the lag, I think Mt.Gox + Dwolla is still probably the best method, despite the queue.
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:18:35
Thanks bud! I think this becomes obvious after a couple transactions, but I totally missed this aspect as a "noob".  At least I didn't go, "I think I've been hacked!! Someone stole $4!"
[edit] Since my initial question, that $200 I talked about, went as low as $191, and is now at $198... All within about 15 minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:32:01
Right? It's impossible to tell what is going on. Yeah, there was a major crash over the last 24 hours, but the dust has not even remotely settled. :\
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:08:24
Ride it out!
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:06:30
Me too, but I wasn't really using their service beyond their counter cashier. To me it was more attractive than opening a checking account at an inconvenient bank (Capital One).
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:56:54
Wondering this too as I have a lot of things to flip on there!
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:55:33
Eh, I think the "free market" can handle this without regulations. We just need competition. Those who have their shit together the most, to them we will flock.

Stupid Internet Matrix Money is the perfect way to describe how most people I explain it to see it at first glance. 
When I was first told about it, around that same time period, I viewed them as a pure experiment in technology that would maybe be used by geeks and hobbyists... Shoulda had someone screaming invest at me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:27:37
He said English isn't their first language. I know it seems hard to understand, but choosing the wrong word in a foreign language is extremely easy, especially when the context is so specific. It's the magic of language... if they had said "because of our popularity" or "due to our increased traffic" it would've read completely different. They probably thought of the service as "in high demand" and chose "success" as a synonym, which implies nothing is wrong... which of course made a lot of people mad.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:30:55
Yeah, their twitter is posting about issues again:
bitfloor ‏ 3h
LocalTill cash deposits are experiencing delays. Please be patient while LocalTill resolves the matter. Your deposits will be credited.
My first Bitfloor deposit was a few days ago and this exact same thing happened then too. I'm in the same boat as you right now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:10:53
Life is always good, my man.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:42:46
Tried them an hour or two ago. No reply to 3 separate emails. Bitfloor stopped answering as well.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:59:24
You bring up a good point about it being USD in a US bank account. I think that might be the difference between this and the previous situation.
Still... fuck this guy.
He could've manned up and been the saving grace of his dying exchanging, helping users tirelessly for a few weeks, making good on all the lost money, demonstrating that he is a solid guy and a trust worthy businessman. If he were involved in future prospects, people would follow him there as loyal customers due to his helpfulness in complicated times.
Instead he became a giant child, just sticking his fingers in his ears, ignoring hundreds of people who have lost thousands of dollars. Not even so much as acknowledging a single email. No attempt at restoring good faith. No attempt at an apology.
Dude's career is fucked. If I see the name "Roman" associated with bitcoins anywhere in the future I will immediately be extremely leery. Way to go dude. An industry on the edge of a boom and you just shit all over the early adopters.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:24:46
Yeah, 6 or so hours here... And yes, this is the second time this happened.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:23:00
Definitely not arguing that, but I'm sure it would have kept rising, instead of falling due to panic sales alone.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:59:26
Same here man. Still don't have anything.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:31:14
While I agree with you, never underestimate the shadiness of world powers. It is certainly on their radar, it is just likely not a threat to them yet.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:55:25
I see... So basically when I took those steps to buying $200 worth of BTC, I essentially bought $200 worth at the very moment $200 = 2.59162301 BTC ... So I bought that amount for $200. Now it has gone down, so while I still have 2.59, it is worth less?
So that being said, I suppose good practice is to buy when you think the market is only going to increase, rather than decrease. I know it basically soared from ~$60 to $77 over the last few days, so it makes sense it's going down over the last few hours? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:27:52
As of 2:59 PM EST, I finally got an email from LocalTill saying it was being processed (exactly 24 hours later). Around 3:15 it showed up on BitFloor. Finally.
Sure, 24 hours isn't that bad. I'm not normally impatient, at all. But I don't like not knowing whats going on with my money, especially when the two parties handling it are virtually impossible to get in touch with. (Bitfloor seems to be run by ONE guy, LocalTill seems to have no support at all)
Lesson learned: Pay better attention (my bad), but also be wary of trusting all these new companies. Most of them do not have their shit together, and we're trusting them with large sums of cash.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:50:16
Don't worry dude, I made a post in here last week saying, "Did I fuck up by buying at an all time high of 80?" 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:39:39
It was barely 1 BTC. But still. What would you recommend in the future?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:39:37
97% of people in this subreddit learned this term in the last 3 days.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:54:51
I saw a post about them locking people out of their accounts...?
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:54:48
Yeah... I have my shit on blockchain. I'm sure Bitfloor is fine most of the time, but it's quite alarming to realize how small they are as an organization and how much money they are handling. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:21:58
I also had problems and posted about it in that newbie thread. A day later I used bitfloor and had another 24 hour delay and a huge price increase. It seems nowhere is free of hang ups right now and we really need a new reliable vendor in this market.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:36:24
Seriously though, I bought in kinda late. Not "top" late, but 60 - 150 late. 
The funny thing is, it's been like, 2.5 weeks. To cash out in a panic right now is retarded IMO. In another month, the entire landscape could be completely different. 
And in all honesty, I really like spending BTC. So I'm happy to have some on hand for that. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:28:03
Yeah that's my mistake, I skim r/bitcoin - see no problems, went ahead with purchase. Then a problem occurs and I search around and feel like an idiot. :|
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:32
Except no one can buy anything right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:49:37
I always do this, but yes, this is good advice!
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:53:46
Any others being given out? I'd love to review this!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:25:54
It sucks, because Bitfloor is super convenient for me, but I have a hard time trusting them; I've had two botched transactions and the absolute best support I can get is a tweet saying, "Yeah, we know."
They came through, 24 hours later, at a shitty exchange rate, both times. Maybe they're doing it on purpose to not have to doll out as many coins? -_-
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:32:53
I haven't had a single issue with them yet... but their userbase is a lot smaller obviously. Would love to see more people trading on there.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:18:41
Yeah, I deposited around 3:50 EST, still haven't received.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:04:56
With the way things have been going "post bubble", I see it as kind of a "two steps forward, one step back" kinda thing. If the market takes those two steps too fast, that one step back comes real quick. A lot of people learned their lesson. Personally, the next time I see $2XX it's going to be really hard not to cash out.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:01:48
Well that's good to know, thanks. Nothing so far.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:38:17

DON'T INTERNET WHAT YOU CAN'T LOSE
@_date: 2013-08-14 22:55:59
That and, people stick with reputable / trusted vendors. So if a new vendor showed up with some outrageously good deal to lure people in... but then those people discovered it was either bunk or poison, the vendor would be kicked off, and everyone would return to their reputable and trusted vendors, except with a little extra caution involved. 
It happens all the time with bunk. Not so much with poison. Vendors offer LSD, but sell a research chemical. Once found out, their reputation is completely done and no one will touch them again. 
Far more people would prefer the immense profits of being a good vendor, than the bizarre satisfaction of fucking with one or two people and being banned for life...
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:56:40
Hey thanks, I'm on the road but I'll reply later to this comment. I appreciate that.

@_date: 2013-04-19 00:15:00
Yeah, it's been a good 24 hours for that though. Upward trending and a slowish climb to get there. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:30:27
Same exact situation as me man, and today was the first day I decided to use it. (As opposed to bitinstant / coinbase) 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:54:37
Ah, yes. But I thought that meant minor variations in price, not a weeks worth of time.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:28:45
Got a response. Just says, "It may take a day or two. Let us know if you don't hear from them today." WTF? Obviously no one has no idea what is going on. Fuck this company.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:23:19
I suppose the bigger question is those who never set up a Capital One account.
I was under the impression most people used Bitfloor by going to BofA and doing it that way. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:55:43
Yup! Great site. Wish more people would use it - but at the same time... I'm enjoying the rock solid stability. :) And due to the low volume, the price actually remains consistent! Minor .25 to 1 USD fluctuations over an entire hour, as opposed to 5 - 20 USD fluctuations. It makes "shorting" more difficult but a lot easier to know what to expect when exchanging.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:55:25
Yeah, for real... 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:40:14
Gotcha. It seems I've hit snags along the way of purchasing a few times this week. Hopefully this minor losses are a moot point in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:50:31
Hey, thanks man! My first tip! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:49:48
Not yet...
[edit] Oh yes, the other day it took 24 hours for the deposit to come through.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:50:12
WTF? That is a terrible fee...
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:20:41
I think he is referring to a much larger picture than just today's fluctuations.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:54:15
Same here.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:40:06
I'm not terribly concerned with that... Function is paramount at this point. I'd rather have a bunch of competent developers than a bunch of competent UI designers. The latter can come with time.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:05:43
Did you get the "this morning" price or the yesterday price?
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:31:17
Yeah, and their interface is user friendly enough that its hard to fuck up. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:49:11
That seems to be the consensus around here... I guess I gotta figure that out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:26:32
Me too.

"We just took a few million to the local Walmart..."
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:08:19
Yeah that logic makes no sense. "Once this is a nerdy niche again, we'll all be rich!"
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:53:44
I was on the list on 4/7 and had mine within 5 hours of receiving a CS response on bitcointalk.org -- But still, very unacceptable. A couple dozen people had the same problem and we all got screwed by the exchange rate.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:55:15
I couldn't think of a more irrelevant time for this meme... $160 is a pretty attractive sell price though. :P Every big new milestone, especially if achieved quickly, comes with a sell-off... Which allows people to buy in about $10 - 15 less than that new high price.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:31:56
To be fair, my girlfriend did a deposit about an hour prior to me, and had hers instantly. Most people do not have any problems. The main thing is, if there's any issue (in my case, there was) - you're pretty much at their mercy.
For me, the Moneygram was painless as anything, but there were a lot of fees. Coinbase also worked smoothly but it took a week, to the point where I was gambling on the value a week ahead of time.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:10:15
It's funny, because every other thread shows them being "the easiest way" right now. People are getting totally mixed messages. :\
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:08:14


Exactly. I said before, I think this guy is day-by-day destroying any chance he has at a future in this sector. 
A month ago, running an exchange may have gotten him involved in a lot of projects and exciting bitcoin developments.
Each passing day cements Bitfloor as a giant scam and joke that will forever haunt this 'Roman' idiot.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:30:26
I'm confident you'll be okay, I've had two separate issues with them (not okay) that were resolved within 24 hours (acceptable) -- The main thing it taught me is how much faith we put in these little companies. There's very little recourse for just getting ripped off.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:37:44
TBH it wasn't that hard for me. To put it in perspective, I tried getting into Mt. Gox a few weeks ago. I learned about Camp BX as an alternative during Gox's DDoS troubles. I transferred money from Dwolla to BX in less time than it took me to get verified at Mt. Gox, let alone transfer funds there.
Now I'm glad I just used BX, since, well, look at Mt. Gox at the moment (down, again). Getting money into Dwolla took about 4 days which is a standard wait for a bank transfer... Getting money from Dwolla to BX took a matter of hours, if that. (I wasn't refreshing obsessively, but checked a few hours later)
So far I've made many buy / sell orders without a single issue at all. No delays, no lag... the price is stable enough to make a smart decision. It has only fluctuated ~$8 in the past few days, and very gradually.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:55:36
I did a deposit at 2PM and it's now 11PM and still hasn't gone through. They said "LocalTill" was having problems. Support was pretty nonexistent... Not really thrilled with these guys right now.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:58:31
All I see is "I acknowledge that the amount of BTC I receive will vary based on future exchange rates."
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:43:51
I ended up getting mine exactly 24 hours after my deposit. No support emails were addressed until the moment they said, "It's processed."

I feel like people forget that's what reddit is designed to do!!
If a humorous image is getting 700 upvotes, obviously people find it humorous. Personally I always have a laugh, which is a nice change of pace from constant speculating and finance talk. Jokes are a refreshing reminder that we all shouldn't take shit so seriously.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:30
Yeah, quite the contrary in fact, which I'm glad he pointed out.
People breaking the law need compensation. They are not going to fuck around with something that does not provide them with proper value for their risk.
