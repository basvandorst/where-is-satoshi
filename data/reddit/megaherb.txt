I liked when people would say they don't care how many bitcoins Satoshi owns and it's unimportant that most bitcoins are held by very early adopters.  The same people don't care that bitcoin infrastructure and services will soon be controlled by wall street, VC firms and the larger world of traditional finance that many bitcoin supporters dislike.

The point is to make the early adopters rich, at the expense of the late adopters.

Make up your own mind about what you do with your own bitcoins.  Take the thoughts of people, who have a vested interest in the value of something rising, with a grain of salt.

I'm not against Bitcoin per se and am pretty interested in cryptocurrencies.  However, there are some problems with Bitcoin that I just can't get over, primarily the top-heavy nature of coin ownership.  
Satoshi very quickly mined roughly 1 million Bitcoins.  Because of this, I view Bitcoin as a "pre-mined" currency.  Following Satoshi, early adopters hold a significant portion of all Bitcoins that will ever be in existence.  Now, VC firms and the broader financial community are funding the infrastructure and services for Bitcoin.  So, this means that Bitcoin ownership is highly centralized, both in terms of coin ownership, wallets, exchanges etc...  This is a system where the average Joe might get a little added value from using Bitcoin, while the controlling parties gain a lot more value as more people join the Bitcoin system.  This I don't like and reminds me of a Ponzi scheme.

About time that wall street and the greater world of finance owned and controlled bitcoin services and infrastructure.

While the bitcoin network is decentralized, the world of finance is mobilizing to own and control all bitcoin infrastructure and services.

Those are just addresses from the blockchain.  A few people could own all of the top 100 addresses from the blockchain, for example.  No one knows, it's anonymous transparency.  At a bitcoin conversion rate of $US 1000, those 100 addresses from the blockchain relate to more than 2.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoins.

Gonna lose a lot of money doing that.  Better hoard.

Sounds a lot more reasonable than he lost his passwords or died

Doesn't sound remotely believable

Cui bono? 
For me, it still seems similar to a pyramid scheme that's going to mostly benefit Satoshi, the Winkilvi and early adopters.  Everyone else gets a little utility and some peanuts, like 10 bitcoins.  
Satoshi has 1 million and the Winkilvi had a few hundred thousand last year.  Who really knows how many bitcoins random early adopters, mining collectives or silk road dues own.  My guess is it's a ton.  Bitcoin is transparent yet anonymous, so you'll never really know if you're just getting a few peanuts.

Cool exchange example, though I understand how that process works.  The assumptions of your example are you always have fiat replacement and that the buy price is identical to the sell price (both seem to hold up from your personal experience, although the second doesn't work in other markets like currency or stock exchanges). 
Also, your response seems to indicate that an ultimate bitcoin price increase is the most important thing to result from actively using bitcoins.  So, I'm going to guess you have a personal monetary incentive to get others to support your viewpoint, trade bitcoins and increase use.  
However, I still have my doubts about the buy/sell being equal, since markets are dynamic.  Seems like bitcoin markets don't update very quickly.  I would bet that if bitcoin exchanges were as active as other stock or currency exchanges, on average you'd lose a tiny amount of value from the buyback (e.g., bitcoin being worth a tiny percentage more than when you sold it).

I see what you're saying but don't think you really understand how this would work in the real world.  
I think we can agree that if a trend exists where the value of a bitcoin increases over time, there's an incentive to hoard and not spend.  Markets are volatile, but on average, you'll lose money whenever you spend a bitcoin.  This trend should exist as bitcoin become more popular. 
To do the buying, exchange and replacement process, you are assuming an endless supply of fiat (for replacement of spent bitcoins) or some other way that always allows a bitcoin to be replaced almost instantly, like they are only a portion of your total savings.  If you have most/all of your money in bitcoins, what are you replacing them with?  
The way the economy works, is if you have a salaried job, you don't get paid every day. You might only be able to replace your bitcoins once every few weeks.  If you did that this past month, you could have lost up to 30% of the original value of your spent bitcoins, due to bitcoin appreciation.

More like controlled (or owned) by a very select group of early adopters.

Including: "the more bitcoins you own, the harder it gets to understand bitcoin," reminiscent of the Upton Sinclair quote "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it"

Doesn't this seem strange to anyone else? Who writes a letter like that to their grandparents, who are probably in their 80s?  
This post reminds me of a pump and dump.
