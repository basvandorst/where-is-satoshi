Great idea! If not coinstar someone should.

@_date: 2013-04-09 19:58:40
Thanks to all for the help!
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:05:53
Wasn't bad analysis. Basically of course, Bitcoin is still very alive and its not going away 
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:56:24
Resistance is always active. Always 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:52:40
Schiff is upset he missed the boat. He knows he should have been front and center in bitcoin and he's behind now. So
Meanwhile gold and silver are monkey hammered every day 
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:49:29
Whats with the downvotes the one posted 15 minutes before me has 120 upvotes?
I guess timing is everything 
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:04:32
It has no profit but at the end of the day you have the choice of turning it in for dollars just like a stock. It has had profit over the last ten years more than the S&amp;P. However this year with Bernanke tired of the gold rush making the USD look bad, well its been clobbered 
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:56:38
Lol yea I was excited. Had to put it on reddit 
Crazy how mainstream bitcoin is getting 
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:14:17
Where did you get those candle charts? For bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:41:48
Well said. And yes I agree. I did take profits already, well basically just got my investment out and all the rest will be profit.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:05:00
I've decided I'm holding long term. What I did was sell enough at $1000 to get all of my original investment back. 
Disappointed but who knows where will be a couple years from now 
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:40:12
I bought on coinbase and store them there. They say they have never lost a bitcoin yet. But ok, what is the best wallet to store besides cold storage?
Thank you in advance 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:18:44
Wow, I own a business and about 2 years ago I got an email from a guy who wanted to pay me in bitcoin. Well I ignored him because I had no idea what he was talking about lol
I also collect currency but I will still buy gold if its goes lower for long term 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:13:11
Way better than the CNN one 
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:31:23
Good I'm just starting to buy a little at a time now. Small amounts on a set monthly basis 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:13:46
I bought yesterday and they said I should have them by November 20th. 
Anyone know why it takes so long. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:18:45
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:08:40
Thats awesome 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:41:26
stocks don't sell off 20%? They sure do. Bad earnings or bad news sets panic selling in wall street as well. 
They will also add manipulation. Theres a reason these major banks do not lose money trading ONE day a year. Not one. 
I think it would be not good for bitcoin to get wall street involved. 
They will take it up or down when they want, you just hope your on the right side of it

At the Garage café in Beijing's version of Silicon Valley, investor Chandler Guo is closely monitoring the price of his favorite investment: the bitcoin. The 30-year-old says he owns a thousand of them and has been watching their value shrink all week.
"I hope everyone just calms down," he said. "A lot of overseas traders are looking at China. They see the price falling here so that affects the whole world."
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:41:18
Thank you sir I will look into this 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:42:12
Oh my bad 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:53:50
Facebook actually started at 0 also. Don't forget it was just an idea way before it went public. 
 There were private shareholders also and it started with one user. So that too has grown 1,000's of %
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:06:53
It's paper vs physical. Just like metals. The actual physical metal holders aren't the ones selling right now. I own a lot of gold and silver and haven't sold one ounce. It's the paper ETF holders of SLV and GLD that are selling. 
You don't want bitcoin to have ANYTHING to do with wall street and the big bankers like JP Morgan. Nothing 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:04:24
I own a lot of silver and gold but im not selling it. I am buying bitcoin now instead of gold. 
Although if gold gets much cheaper I will buy more. Anything under $1200 in gold is good price. Under $1000 buy as much as you can. 
Silver im done with for now
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:44:53
Very nice, the Savage axis is a great gun for the buck, I have one and its awesome. Never had an issue with it. Bolt action I got a left handed one too just for me 
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:45:00
Well obvious to some but not all. Idk I just like talking about bitcoin to be honest. 
Its fun 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:21:54
I go once a year every year. Aruba usually but I like St Maarten as well! Just got back in Oct hopefully next time I can use bitcoin to pay for my beers on Orient Beach !! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:37:45
I do searches on google for bitcoin everyday so I'm gonna start posting some of them. 
Yea I find most of them know nothing 
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:15:49
Things are different than they were back in the other crashes. Not VERY different but it is more on the center stage now.
More people really believe in it. And most people are just hearing about it besides the fact that almost none still know how to purchase them. 
im saying that if a company comes out and improves on Coinbase making it even more mainstream to use, then bitcoin will really appreciate in value. Not only in dollar terms but overall value.
It may be one of those phenoms that just begin to appear mainstream and by then the early investors will be greatly rewarded.
On the other hand we may have the WRONG people get involved and crash this so they can start all over on their terms. 
Dont think that big banks aren't watching BTC and finding ways to begin manipulating this. I have traded on the market for 4 years and see what they do on wall street. money is money and watching BTC go from pennies to $1000 gets them thinking about all sorts of things
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:32:45
Cnbc does the same thing when talking about gold. 
Yet twitter is already worth 26 billion with ZERO profit 
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:33:07
Same here guys, I bought on the 14th and still don't have the coins. 
This needs to be fixed or people won't want to bother. 
Also what's with the different prices on every exchange??
Coinbase is $100 different from Mt. Gox, so what one will be right if I go to sell. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:04:15
as soon as big banks catch on and have control they will find a way to manipulate by shorting etc. don't think bitcoin isn't on their radar.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:31:16
Well we will find out weds. So far everything looks good. Money has been transferred etc. so let's see 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:48:11
Im a big goldbug but im a bitcoin bug too I guess.
And yes I actually do believe gold is being suppressed because its an embarrassment to the USD when it was at all time highs.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:56:41
EVERYTHING can be gamed, what about Gold?
Ive traded for 3 years and watch the market every day. Trust me they will find a way to manipulate 
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:57:21
Thanks man 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:57:00
Thank you !!
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:06:40
Wow man that is unbelievable.
The ignorance is AMAZING!!
Reddit needs to get this teacher some consequences 
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:54:51
and thank you 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:56:27
What will cause bitcoin to break this resistense? That's a good question. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:34:03
You should NOT be investing anything that will lead you to consider suicide ESPECIALLY in bitcoin right now. 
Bitcoin is very volatile, please only invest what you comfortable with. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:20:53
How do you mean? Do you think BTC is already being manipulated? I have thought about it and would like someone  much more brilliant than I to explain how it IS possible 
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:55:25
I'm wondering of those who down voted this why? Honestly 
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:01:17
Great article 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:40:15
That....was....awesome 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:10:36
Here let me speak for 15 minutes then you can answer after the break after the audience forgets the question. 
What an idiot 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:48:34
I was watching it live, no links 
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:25:12
Missed it. But one of my friends who I'm always telling about bitcoin sent it to me because he's a chive user. So a bunch are seeing it 
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:33:19
I bought from Coinbase on the 14th at 424 I'm supposed to get mine tonorrow AM. If not I'll be pretty upset and they will for sure know this 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:42:09
Thanks this is the next step in my noob bitcoin ventures, first learn how to buy, then learn how to store them the right way 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:49:21
Fox business just got a big win over CNBC with Maria Bartiromo
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:01:06
Yea 100% where do they get off comparing it to silver? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:53:01
 It’s entirely water-cooled
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:47:50
I see. Thanks guys. The BTC I bought on the 14th did arrive this morning from Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:33:34
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:09:11
So if I own the bitcoin with a Coinbase wallet and want to sell. I sell at their price correct? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:12:30
The market is at an all time high. As soon as it begins to tank (which is when the fed decides to taper QE), stocks like twitter will get hammered. 
Investing in the future is great, but zero profit and 26 billion market cap eventually the investors will want to see a positive earnings report 
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:00:10
Yea honestly im excited for 2014 
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:53:02
Gold is a shitty investment?? Whoa whoa this year maybe yes, but the previous 10 years its outperformed stocks.
Warren Buffet is a billionaire, you are not. He can control companies with the amount of stock he buys. you are not warren buffet lol 
Try trading on your own and come back to me in 1 year with all the money you lost
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:08:43
Lol on the safe comment 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:50:36
I bought from Coinbase ordered on the 14th and got mine this morning. I'll be using them again 
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:31:57
Have you read those comments? Talk about ignorance 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:12:51
Haha awesome 
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:23:37
address yes. 
Thought it was quite interesting 
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:54:46
Thank you 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:53:27
and thank you 
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:00:11
That's nothing man, you can lose that trading in the market in 2 minutes. 
If you still believe in bitcoin then hold on 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:40:37
This is an amazing post. Thank you OP 
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:20:19
I agree. You will probably see a huge spike after 900 
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:34:19
Good to hear. I'm a self admitted noob bought my first 5 from there yesterday. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:57:34
I wasnt berating you at all. If thats how you took it then I dont how to help you with that.
But your statement on gold was off. Its not a "shitty" investment. Yes in 2013 it HAS been.
 And congrats on 5k. Ive traded for 4 years and its not anywhere as easy as Warren Buffet makes it look. Most hedge funds this year have actually struggled even with the market at all time highs.
But yea, berating others is something I dont do
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:18:32
Yes , I guess the one problem would be if everyone decided to cash out at once 
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:35:27
Ok then my bad 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:51:50
Agreed, they will eventually have to hire someone and put a phone number on their site. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:09:54
I use bitcoin ticker it's a great app 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:15:30
So what everyone is saying is the ONLY reason you believed in Bitcoin is because of China?? Yes it inflated the price but damn come on now. 
If you like the bitcoin protocol hold, if not sell. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:14:01
I agree 100% I CANT STAND when they show the physical bitcoins. 
There was a segment once on CNBC where one pinhead had one in his hand and was showing it off and they were all like "oh thats a bitcoin" I was so annoyed
And others who know I collect silver and gold just think its another coin that is meaningless ughhhh
Yea you can tell im annoyed too 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:07:57
ha nice! These kids were awesome, I think they were brothers, Ill try to find a link 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:48:06
Much respect to you man for your service, and happy your using Bitcoin as well!!
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:45:22
These articles bring up some very good points this one for example:
Looking at bitcoin so called “power decentralization” where 100 holders hold 2.23 million Bitcoins of the 11.12 million total doesn’t make me comfortable if I want to join? Top bitcoin holders represent over 20% of the entire outstanding amount of the alternative currency.
With all these hoarders this may pose a problem once a big holder decides to sell. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:59:45
There will be blood is my favorite movie. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:35:12
Hey just some friendly advice, if you have enough invested to be scared maybe take a little off the table.
Also if bitcoin rises enough for you to get your investment out then do so.
This way you can relax and enjoy this roller coaster.
Because not many are invested now like we are. So try to enjoy it if any way possible 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:53:48
Theyre talking about bitcoin black friday right now!! 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:25:06
I agree, but yea China was the catalyst 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:05:41
I'm expecting mine to arrive weds. I bought at 424 on the 14th with a bank account withdrawal that they have already taken out. I hope nothing goes wrong and I still get them 
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:35:19
hmmm thats a tough one 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:40:41
Yes, you are right. I get that confused. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:23:07
Agreed. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:47:11
I think eventually there will be a bank like etrade that is insured to hold cash as well as purchase bitcoins. This will allow instant buy and sell orders to execute 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:25:47
Yea I posted this ASAP he sent this out on his newsletter tonight 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:57:31

I dont visit chive, Im a Reddit guy. It actually annoys me the chive people think its so great when they get all of their content from Reddit, but of course they dont believe me
