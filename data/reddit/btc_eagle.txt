Make sure to hit up the community in Saigon in case you pass by:
We also have a Bitcoin ATM in downtown Saigon:
But you might be able to convert BTC to VND cheaper at one of the online exchanges (they allow cash withdrawals via all banks in the country) -

The Federal Reserve has transcripts of their meetings too.
So not really an argument which will convince those people, who think that Bitcoin governance should not replicate the good ol' Central Banking model (you might not belong into this group - but certainly a considerable amount of people involved in Bitcoin do).

Potential downside I would see here:
If a hacker obtains that "recovery key", he could make the funds "inaccessible" to the original owner of the address by every time the original owner tries to move the coins out - reverting the transaction right back.
So while the coins are not stolen - you can't move them anymore though.
The hacker could e.g. then demand like a 50% ransom etc. to be paid in order to allow a transaction to pass through.

Which is another positive thing about him (would not vote for him though, since I despise the political system in general and refuse to participate in this kind of schemes).
I don't want my money to be controlled by unqualified government-psychopaths - nor do I like my Internet usage controlled by this kind of people.

Depends on how backwards the banking / financial system is in the place one is living.
Here in Asia fiat transfers often don't take more than a few hours (interbank) or are (increasingly so) instant (intrabank anyway - but - depending on the country - also more and more interbank).
E.g. international fiat transfers from Hong Kong / Philippines to Vietnam were recently received in VN within at max. 2h after the payee in the origin country initiated the transaction.

Socialism at work - throwing society back to barter systems... - great to see though that people are trying to route around the damage done as good as possible.
Such developments hopefully make these societies more resilient against future well-meaning government interventions.
Regarding the OP's suggestion: How is Bitcoin supposed to handle the (hypothetical) flood of transactions if suddenly thousands of Greeks would want to use Bitcoin?
Athens alone currently has around 3m inhabitants in his urban area - so 1 out 10 inhabitants could do approx. 1 Bitcoin tx per day (given the hypothetical situation that nobody else around the world would like to do Bitcoin on-chain transactions on that day).
I see how Bitcoin could help the current individual Bitcoin user in the current Greek mess - but not so much, how it could solve widespread economic troubles which concern whole societies.

The sign belongs to a bar in Bui Vien Street (Backpacker Quarter) - but they don't accept Bitcoin.
One of the owners is a big Localbitcoins Trader though - so it is not completely without connection.

Fees on VBTC ( are currently 0,3% + 1% deposit/withdrawal fee.
Given that there is usually a premium of 1-3% above the world market spot rate - converting from BTC to VND is quite cheap actually.
Buying BTC on the other hand is certainly more expensive in Vietnam.

No personal experience yet with them regarding the Bitcoin refund process - but  offers flights, cruises, hotels etc. for Bitcoin.
Interview with their general director can be found here (English version below):
