I originally bought because I felt bitcoin was a valuable asset to invest in, and that it would become the currency of the future. However, I am concerned now because the rate at which the price has been increasing is not natural, and does not reflect the state of bitcoin. 
Currently transaction fees are so high that bitcoin can't even fulfill the purpose it was created for - to be a viable currency. Now I know that the lightning network is being developed, but we don't know when it is coming other than "soon." Until then, it's not a viable currency and I am concerned that bitcoin is significantly overvalued. People are buying into it because the price is going up rather than buying into it because it's a good currency.

I'm with you dude, the fees are insane. Bitcoin is incredibly overvalued right now

Yes, i am worried

I see, wouldn't you want to store your wealth somewhere that's less volatile though?

Because they are backed up by your faith and trust in the government? I'm not saying blockchain isn't the way of the future, however as of right now it's not even good as a currency. Steam having to remove the ability to pay with bitcoin should be a pretty good indicator of this...

You're welcome. Everyone else on this sub seems to be delusional about the state of bitcoin.
I want to sell my Bitcoins but I'm hesitant because Im waiting to see if the fees will go down some first.

Even if it was 5, no body is going to want to wait longer than 30 seconds to pay for their groceries
