this is why gold and silver are so valuable, from my research a bank can't print gold, only gold paper. Printing of currency ruins the economy

That is just creepy. Disable the feature perhaps?

if you use electronics, then yes. Silver is a perfect conductor for electricity, if there is not enough of it, the price will go up.
If you don't use electronics, move on along, nothing to see.

New Zealand doesn't even appear on the map, we must be small :D

printing money does that, quantitative easing they call it.  Slowly your currency is worth less and less.

So if I wank in my house without anyone knowing, it is suspicious, cool!.

the problem is the irs treat the bitcoin like property, much like a product.

when retail stores like your local grocery won't accept dollars, that is when things will change.

thank you for sharing that information, from what I have watched on youtube, only stars can make gold, because of the pressure and heat required to do so.

free market basically, which hasn't existed since 1913

all about control basically, they are scared, bring on innovation, change shit!.
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:05:39
from my experience, they can ask hard questions.

from what I have read and seen on videos, yes it is, or it will be.  The other part is the ratio of gold/silver certificates vs the actual amount of the metal.  From what I have researched, its treated like fractional reserve banking.

i hope your recording the questions that are coming up. So people don't have to ask the same thing again.  I would read it, as just for interest sake.

that is what the govt does, only its billed in to make it legal tender. Except the govt ones hardly contain any PE

where I live, only a beer company accepts bit coins, no idea if any other company does, which is why at the moment I do not want to be paid in it.

common sense is great
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:46:34
at the end of the video he is talking about control, which is what they are scared of losing.

CEO speeches are great. Sound impressive, how they do not tell you what is hurting them, simply talk about challenges.
@_date: 2014-08-21 04:00:57
one thing I hate about bitcoin, since its virtual, the system can be switched off. physical assets can not be switched off.  Now this sounds very much like the actual banking system of today eek!.
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:48:12
ssh, don't talk about fiat. That is a secret.
