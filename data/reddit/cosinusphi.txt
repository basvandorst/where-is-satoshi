I think my post misses an "irony" or even "sarcasm" tag ...

IMHO "blockchain developers" in a strict sense won't be in much demand anymore in the coming years: Already today there are more blockchains running than needed, just look at all the altcoins and all the Bitcoins forks, thank you very much :)
Of course the need for improving existing blockchain software will stay, but I would see this more and more as a job for a handful of "hardcore", highly specialized devs.
I see much more demand in building services on top of cryptocurrencies. And that means either web app development, or app (iOS / Android) development. For both neither C++ nor Java are first choice.

That post you cite was made more than 8 years ago. Don't you think a lot happened in the meantime that was impossible to foresee back then, which Bitcoin still in its infancy and hardly any altcoin around yet?

Permissionless, and trustless. Both things very remarkable, true, and probably hard to believe for somebody who never heard about Bitcoin.
Of course "decentralized" is nice and should be mentioned as well, but I think almost everybody already knows something that is decentralized to some extent, that's not so surprisingly new.

Yes. If your country's currency is crumbling because of hyperinflation, the problem is only the currency, so another better currency will fix the problem pronto :)

If I am sick with fever, and it finally goes down, I am usually quite happy. Why should it be otherwise when "corporate America" has blockchain and Bitcoin fever which finally subsides?
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:24:47
Hmm, right, I can see them too now. Maybe that "image.ibb.co" server where they come from was down when I checked.

Except the bankers :)

Imagine a possible future world where Bitcoin became the world's reserve currency. Maybe at least some "war machinery" would be needed to protect miners?
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:19:36
Do I understand correctly: You think a graph of Bitcoin's hashrate has some predictive power concerning future BTC price?
Isn't it more the other way round? If the price rises it becomes more profitable to mine, so more miners join, but only afterwards, after the price rise. So a hashrate graph will tend to lag the price, right?
Edit: Adding missing "rises"

I think you could have found a better example than hedge funds as something that people first feared but then they were proven wrong. Electricity, trains, planes, Internet - all things that are basic and important parts of civilization now. Hedge funds? Not so much.

Hmm, when I read "rapidly declining" checking a 2-year chart is not the first thing that comes to my mind ... but never mind.
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:59:42


A decentralized news website? How does that work?


For people like me who don't know what this word means: 
And then: Even crypto anarchists have PayPal accounts? It seems GenesisBlockNews hopes so because they have a "Donate with PayPal" button ...
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:57:11
Interesting! What is on the other side then? I mean, where do you send the SMS to, and how does it reach the Bitcoin network from there? Do you operate your own gateway, or is this a service somewhere?
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:26:48
Anyone with a good link to an explanation of that "compression" thing?
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:27:20


I share your opinion more or less, but I was surprised when I wanted to check that "rapidly declining trading volume" myself and did *not* find it, at least not in the volume charts on CoinMarketCap.com. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:57:21
If you change the crypto algorithm that produces Bitcoin public/private key pairs to something stronger and quantum-resistant, wouldn't that change all addresses as well? And wouldn't this be a logistical nightmare?
It may be easy to replace parts, but how would you move everybody and everything over to using the new parts?
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:39:41
Hell yes, what do you expect from a blog with the name "Bank Underground" :)
@_date: 2018-11-13 12:42:51
The tweet starts with a false premise, that the largest Bitcoin mining related company and the largest gold mining company have a similar stock market valuation, while gold's markets size is 30 times bigger than Bitcoin's. You are supposed now to become convinced that Bitmain's valuation is "nuts", ah, no, sorry, it's actually "totally nuts", like you know, 30 times too high.
Little problem: World's top gold mining company is definitely not only $18 billions. It's factors bigger, and gold mining has a lot more "Bitmains" (large companies) than Bitcoin mining. See my other post with links to data.

They seem to have a "testnet" where you can try out trading without danger to loose any real BTC:

If you know just a little bit about math and compound interest it's clear that almost no daily percentage of interest would be low enough to be credible, and workable. Even a mere tenth of a percent daily interest would result in a win of about 44% over a year. What kind of "investment" on earth delivers sustainable wins of such a magnitude?
Bernie Maddoff to the rescue :)
This is just a plain-dumb pyramid scheme in (early) action.
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:54:41


Do you have some details? What parts of the design could be replaced in order to become quantum-resistant?
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:07:58
Well, I do think as well that the logic of that headline does not play out. It should be "Predicts Bitcoin ETF Will Attract Billions", not "Could".
I predict that my prediction could not be true, or what :)
@_date: 2018-11-13 10:20:19
It explains some things alright, but it also just claims a lot of things without really arguing or explaining. Maybe call it a good "Bitcoin teaser video" ...
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:08:37
I tend to prefer the source for my news: 
On the "About" page of that website you can read who is writing: "Bank Underground is a new blog written by staff at the Bank of England." So, in my view, something like semi-official.
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:07:09
Whatever there is about the Petro, it's a government project, and I would say many people see the government as the source of most problems in Venezuela, so ... maybe better take Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-13 12:31:46
From the tweet:


I think the person who wrote that is a little nuts. Just check the $126 Billion stock market valuation ("Market Cap") of BHP Billiton: 
Or how about Rio Tinto, with over $80 billions: 
Maybe who knows very little about gold should not tweet such things?
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:24:01
They even have some sense of humor, as you can see on the issuing company's page about the ETP here: 


HODL5 :)

What is he exchanging his BTC into then? If he exits to Bolivar, that's probably just as risky. If he exits to some hard currency like USD, why BTC is needed in the first place?
@_date: 2018-11-24 12:28:21
Your screenshots seem broken.

Note that this is about **central** banks, not just any "normal" banks. It's quite some step from cryptocurrencies "cutting out middlemen scams known as banks" to becoming a viable alternative to central banks.
And last I heard we are still waiting for the first bank closing because Bitcoin cut away so much "scam middlemen business" that they went bankrupt.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:09:28
Very well, but what has that to do whether I hold on to my private keys?
If you ask me it would be much better to advice me to keep my Bitcoins in my own wallet. Handing over my Bitcoins to somebody else who turns them into a mere bookkeeping entry which then is in danger of things like "rehypothecation" is the real problem, not my keys. If I transfer my Bitcoins to an entity like Kraken of course I still hold my private keys, but do not really control my Bitcoins any more.
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:08:48
If you ask me, that post title is nonsense: If I don't hold on to my private keys, it's not the Bitcoin system that might be in real danger, it's simply my Bitcoins that are in real danger: I give you my private keys, you transfer away my Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:30:31
I hereby coin the new term *coinrun*: That's when entities like Grayscale "rehypothecate" Bitcoins and produce them out of thin air, like banks always do with fiat currency, and then too many people at once want to transfer those Bitcoins which are not really "there" to their own wallets.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:13:09
Your username of "BitcoinPeace" sounds a little optimistic right now, I guess not much peace of mind to have with basically everything in Bitcoin, like you say.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:06:23
Note to self: If the post title is already the whole post, post is useless most of the time.
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:19:42
That's probably this company: 
Looks like they have some VC money to burn through :)
