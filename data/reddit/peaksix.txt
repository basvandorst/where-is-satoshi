Gotcha, thanks. So when I linked it to my reddit username to Changetip, I essentially created a new account with a new wallet with them, correct?
Does Changetip charge a transaction fee for that? Or was there a fee that went to the miners? My understanding thus far is that electronic wallets are free to use, but if that's the case, I'm not sure what the incentive is for them to provide that service.

Wow, this sounds almost too good to be true. Is there anything inherent to bitcoin that makes this possible? Watching the purse.io video, it appears they're simply buying excess gift cards behind the scenes (purchasing for a discount), and then buying the item for you, and accepting your bitcoins in return. My only guess is that bitcoin allows them to bypass the traditional credit card processing fee, somehow allowing them to make a profit.

I just put my order in with Coinbase. But it says it'll take 4 business days? Ugh. Is that pretty normal? All the bitcoin videos hyped "instant payments" but waiting 4 days is slower than a typical bank transfer!

Playing dumb? No, not at all. Maybe I misunderstood the difference between bitcoin payments/transfers and USD to BTC exchanges, but hey, that's why I posted this thread.
Anyways, if they're limited by the speed of traditional banking, that's understandable. But often times I am able to see payments process same business day. 3 days at the absolute latest. Which is why I'm questioning where the 4 days come from.

Cool, thanks!
Just to make sure I'm understanding how that transfer worked, did you send the bits to changetip, and then they sent them to me? Or did changetip just act as a way to exchange information, to facilitate you sending them directly to me?
