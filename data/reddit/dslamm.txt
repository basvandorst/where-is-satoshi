What method should I take in doing this? I am not very good with creating wallets using offline OS's. Literally all I know what to do is sloppy wallets. Where I disconnect to the internet and create a wallet from bitaddress and encrypt it. Then write down the private key or print it.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:34:17
Is electrum safe?
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:34:45
Fair fair 
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:54:17
Good old pen and paper and your brain
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:46:19
You are obviously not patient enough to buy gold, it is a LONG TERM INVESTMENT and a preservation of wealth. Ya no, a hedge against inflation...

Thanks a lot mate, appreciate it. Happy Hodling. Do you reckon this correction can go much further?
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:01:23
Interesting, I reckon more and more people will start to accept it as a form of money too
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:35:04
Cheers guys, it was just because someone said not to use bitaddress. I am going to use my spare laptop, boot up tails and generate a key whilst offline using bitaddress, and then never connect it to the internet again and just use it for media etc.. 
Is tails the best temp OS to use ? 
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:21:54
aye but what is wrong using bitaddress on a computer that will stay offline?
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:46:21
Thanks a ton mate, you have cleared pretty much everything up! I printed off from bitaddress and the QR code which was produced was only about 1.2cmx1.2cm for some reason :/. Can I manually type or copy the private link using Mycelium or is there any other web based wallets you would recommend. What is wrong with BCI?
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:21:49
Does it matter what country you are from and whether or not coplay works? I am trying to get my coins from the old paper wallet to my new one. How would I do this?
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:58:23
Lol, beat me to it
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:37:45
Corrections occur in waves. I don't mean it is going to hit 20 again, bbut I want to buy in the 600s. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:42:35
Grats, now hodl!
@_date: 2016-06-16 10:35:02
Cheers guys, could I ask what the fees are for sweeping a wallet into electrum?
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:00:29
By the hexadecimal number do you mean the long on (on the right) around 54 characters long? Ohh okay I won't use that then. Can you manually copy the private key into Cobay to retieve my slightly hotter storage systems and use Cobay to deposit my funds into the newer, colder storage? Is there any great guides for using Ubuntu etc to create a fresh storage onto USB?
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:48:13
What is wrong with bitaddress? Any alternative?
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:21:23
Is there any way of getting the bitcoins off my encrypted wallet then?
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:05:52
I am going to use Electrum, am I right that I need to sweep my old wallet, and then send the funds from my electrum wallet into the new cold storage wallet?  Do you know the transaction fee for this ?
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:05:00
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:54:49
Once it is complete and the old wallet is swept, is it wise to destroy it or just leave it?
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:16:24
I used bitaddress :) So long as I do not re-connect that machine which I used to generate the address, there shouldn't be a huge risk of getting my key logged?  I have encrypted the wallet and placed onto 4 seperate flashdrives, along with printout copies using a bog standard printer. I did all of this whist booted up in tails using a flashdrive. Would it have been safer to use a DVD rom instead to boot up tails?
I followed the exact steps from that youtube link I sent, is this the correct method?
Sorry I am over paranoid but I know that you can never be too paranoid with bitcoin there are some clever bastards out there
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:41:28
I know your feeling, I bought at 690 lol so no gains for me
@_date: 2016-06-19 08:31:40
I kinda want a correction go buy some , not got enough as I came late :/
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:48:53
Ahh, I have 5 transactions that make up 0.4 if that helps
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:48:27
Exactly how I am feeling right now, no one knows. By the way people on here will want you to buy because it will increase the price
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:32:31
Just the one wallet 
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:25:00
Do I need to un encrypt the wallet from bitaddress first and use the uncompressed private key?
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:10:37
Nice one ! What are your views of OpenBazaar? Safe to sell some old items for BTC?
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:56:55
Really good ! Do you think it is too risky to buy now?
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:47:09
And why are you posting this on bitcoin page?
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:53:35
Thanks, what's your address I will come give them in person? 
Seriously though, am I right in what I am doing?
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:34:38
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:14:52
Oh my loord
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:11:36
How do you check the settings? So it won't usually be more than 1 dollar ?
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:05:49
I'm a late comer to Bitcoin, could have bought at 280 .. Do you reckon the price could correct to allow for some buys around 660 or is this unlikely with the current situations ?
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:41:12
I know how to do it, I am justnew to this and I do not want to make a mistake. So I sweep the old paper wallet, the BTC is then in my electrum wallet for me to send to the public address of the new cold storage wallet? 
Sorry for being a noob I just want to make sure I do not make a mistake doing this process. How much is the transaction fee for performing this?
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:09:14
Perfect xD
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:47:25
Surely governments will buy a lot when it hts 10k?
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:22:27
Done :)
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:10:55
What is your point?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:00:03
DONE IT THANKS :D
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:15:08
BIP38 encryption 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:56:36
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:08:01
I have my private key and the passphrase for the encryption I used .
I need a method to decrypt the wallet so I can then sweep to electrum
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:34:05
Bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:17:32
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:25:28
My problem is the website, bit2factor.org does not seem to be live anymore. I need a decryption site so I can upload my wallet to electrum. I have no issues with my electrum account I'm fully logged on with a wallet ready
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:29:44
I was not planning on doing so, I just want to be rest assured if BTC did for any reason get taken over by BTH, I want to be able to access them. In no rush :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:36:01
Literally came through just now guys, but still, 6 days ...
I was hoping to jump into a little IOTA but now its gone too high xD
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:38:06
This is what I am trying to do, but bit2factor.org is not working
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:14:56
This day will go down as the 'death of the shitcoins' RIP
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:10:57
Good point, do you reckon selling just after fork is the best option?
@_date: 2016-07-03 07:46:54
I use bittylicious in uk
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:08:01
Lol, and you back you statement up with what exactly ?
