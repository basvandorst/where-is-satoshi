Nobody knows anything. The people saying it's gonna dip and the people saying it's gonna go to 10,000 are all speaking out of their asses. However, corrections do exist, and this is a very very steep climb. I'd imagine there's a correction sometime soon, and it'll drop back to 3000/2500 Area, then claim again to 3500,4500 before correcting again.

Stuff always gets held for large amounts, so they can verify it's real especially when it's from a different bank. You'll still have fees for bitcoin, especially when sending a large amount too?

I think the problem is the perspective of how much you are getting. I have a fraction of a bitcoin, averaged to like 2700 buy price I believe. Now, if I put 20-50$ in, it just feels like I'm buying literally nothing. I know that's how currency exchanges work and all, but the motivators to buy - even small amounts (10,20$ a week) become less and less as those dollar amounts become less and less bitcoin.

Yes your fees are going to be pretty large for a purchase of that size.

Yeah I totally understand, it's just the mental part (also, do I even want more btc ?)

I'm somewhat of a newbie, and I really just want an honest response (please?). I don't have a ton of crypto in relation to others, but do have a diversified portfolio spread between BTC, ETH, and LTC. All funds are offline in a wallet, but is it worthy liquidating the BTC into alt coins or should i just hodl everything through whatever the hell is about to happen and hope for the best for everything? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:36:44
Okay. I think I'll just hodl and hope for the best. Maybe buy some more if stuff goes really, really bad but who knows

They take loads of fees for paypal, and with the item sales, but I'm not sure about bitcoin. I just put in my coinbase address and i'm assuming they will just send over 220 worth. I'll keep watching and see if there is a good time to buy/prices drop a bit more.

Hey, so I have ~$220 in money on OPSkins, (a site you can sell video game items and such on), and they have a bitcoin cashout option. I've been thinking of cashing it out into bitcoin as it sounds fun and I can see cryptocurrency being important in the future, but I'm not sure *when* to cash it out. I could do it now, and get whatever the equivalent in bitcoin is when they send it, or I could just watch the price and see if it drops again in the near future. 
any suggestions?

You would have to talk to your employer, but you could do it manually. Link your bank to Coinbase or another exchange and you can buy whatever $ worth of bitcoin works for you.

What happens on Aug 1? I'm new, so not up to date on events like this :/

can you explain what a soft fork is and what it means?
