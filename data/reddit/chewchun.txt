Its useful to a certain extent (e.g use in electronics as conductors) but the usefulness does not justify its current price. It is because over the centuries, we, the society have come to a collective decision that gold is valuable (because its rare, hard to mine and its shiny).
Similarily, Bitcoin could be the new gold once we have decided that Bitcoin is valuable.

gold has no direct usefulness either. so is currencies... they have a value because we have come to a consensus that it has a value

Bitcoin is a poor form of money due to its poor store of value. But it is a excellent form of currency.

My concept of intrinsic value is its application in the real-world. Gold is a good conductor and is used in electronics and aerospace. However, much of its current price is due to its perceived value, that gold is shiny, rare and difficult to obtain. The society have thus came to a consensus that gold is valuable. Due to its features of scarcity, good store of value etc, it became money, or a commodity.

Would I wanna go through all these effort just to save 1% fee? I will definitely move to wordpress when I'm doing hundreds of transactions a day. Wordpress is so much more customizable but it can be a pain to set up everything.
By then I will pay your dog 0.1 bitcoin a day to process all the transactions. Or you can do it with your dog.

Guess where all your "Made In China" goods come from?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:40:47
I hate to say it, but more than half of your stuff are made in China, whether it says so or not. I'm in no way 'admiring' sweatshops but stating the truth. That is, unless you are making an active effort by not buying made in china goods.

I have to say, Bitcoin is gonna be a alt coin. The question is when

I'm offering my viewpoint based on my current experience in Shanghai blockchain community and sharing with people who are interested to know about it. We are all here to HODL. If you have different viewpoints from me then lets agree to disagree.

It is not a crypto friendly country, FOR now. They are laying the foundations for the future. Blockchain startups are sprouting all over China. They have applied for more blockchain patents than the US in 2017. 
If you have been to China you would understand how advanced they are in technology. Literally years ahead than most countries. And they are definitely the hot favorites to adopt nation-wide crypto-payments within the next decade. Think far, not month by month

Let's agree to disagree...

Definitely. They are currently piloting a digital currency employing encryption technology. I'm pretty sure its just gonna be a centralized currency and subjected to the same rules and policies as RMB.

The price difference is about 10%. I can transfer money from my country bank account to my Chinese bank account and just use alipay to transfer money from my Chinese bank account to huobi exchange and buy. I'm sure the commission cost is less than 10% in total and the whole process takes less than 2day.

Like it or not. Read the official notice by the government if you can read mandarin. They are not banning it. Its all FUD. Wait for a couple months when the market stabilizes.

Gonna give it a try anyway. See how it goes. Will update this post
