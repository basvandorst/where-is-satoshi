What does your linkedin in say to draw such attention?

Glad someone else saw that

Assuming that he borrowed from the 401k itself, the interest gets paid back into your own account. The worst that could happen is the loan offsets and he owes taxes on the outstanding loan balance.

Would you mind elaborating on the pros and cons of an ico vs an ipo?

It was dumb luck unless they knew about Chinese regulation before anyone else.

That actually would be reasonable considering they would probably not be holding billions of crypto on a thumb drive.

The above poster is not completely incorrect. 401ks usually have a very select number of investment choices. You still get to choose, but the pool is typically quite limited.

Just to clarify, I think in kind transfers would be limited to making a BTC--&gt;BTC transaction or transfer.  I know that an in kind transfer with stocks is essentially moving your stocks as stocks(as opposed to selling them and buying them back in another account).  Like a stock can be transferred in kind from a 401k to an IRA without selling the actual stock.
