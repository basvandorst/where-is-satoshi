The payment wont be sent until I sync? I understand that my client/gui wont show confirmations until synced, but I thought the btc would still be sent?
At this point the 15 minute window for the coinbase payment is long expired, but the payment is still listed as sent in my unsynced wallet. What should I do?

What's confusing me is it is not showing any record on blockchain.info at all. I searched using the transaction ID and the address I sent the payment to.

The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.

I'm curious about the shopping cart in general. It looks nice and simple, to the OP or anyone else who might have an idea--was it a custom built thing, free/paid scripts etc?
I need something just like this for a website with just a few products. Right now its setup to where it just sends the user over to PayPal using PayPal's simple web based add to cart buttons.

You're saying you pay well over $850/mo in maintenance on your house? Or did your spending habits change etc

Don't believe the headline numbers you read for these acquisitions. The quoted "cash" was 4 billion, the rest was stock, but even for that its not like Facebook wired over $4 billion into some bank account. 
It's like how Hollywood movies can make hundreds of millions above the cost of the movie and then turn around and say the movie was a loss on their taxes. Creative accounting at its highest level.

Who are these people who check open source software to make sure its legit (in general, not even just crypto related)? One would think if they spent all that time doing it they'd put together a website, forum, or some way to share their analyses with the public. I've never seen anything like that (though I'd love to hear if there is one).
I'm afraid everyone just assumes *someone* out there is checking, but nobody really is. 
It also can't be easy or quick to examine the source code. A smart programer trying to hide something could find ways to obfuscate the code to make it difficult or misleading to people examining it. And also they could just have the original versions of the software be legit, then add in some malicious code as part of an update once they've established credibility and people stopped checking. Every new release would have to be checked over again.

Yeah 3% for processing credit cards is very standard on any service that processes the credit card transactions. Merchant CC processing like authorize.net and other things like that have charge fees. I imagine the actual credit card companies like Visa charge something like 2%. Thus 1% cash back from credit card companies is no big deal to them.
(Though its worth pointing out PayPal still charges 3% even when a payment is funded from a PayPal balance--something that costs them nothing beyond keeping their basic service/website operational)

Yeah not sure why he seems so angry about the title. *However* soon there are going to be overwhelming amounts of submissions just like this. Lots of businesses accepting crypto is a good thing to see, but lets be honest, they *are* trying to make money and posts like this really are a method to get free advertising.

Good call on mentioning this. Never trust random people on the internet. Anyone can submit a thread and it might get upvoted until it seems legit. By the time people call it out its already too late.
I cringe every time I see a sob story donation drive anywhere near the front page of reddit (obviously this case is different). Many of them are not verified *properly* and/or the money received isn't verified to be handled in an upfront way.

I hope you can see why it shouldn't be possible to disable an account by providing only an email address. (Regardless of the activity or status of the account.)

You could get by on about $550/mo rent and utilities for something like a 2br 1ba apartment in the midwest non-city area. Much less if you have 1 or 2 roommates.

I feel like it was probably more dependent on your previous year's taxes for proof of your income. I'm sure you had to provide 2 years of tax records?
@_date: 2016-06-05 09:08:19
Yes. And its about 70+ GB of download roughly nowadays.
Alternatively you can use a "light" wallet like electrum so you don't have to download the entire blockchain.

Where? Not where I am or any place nearby.

My bitcoin-core wallet.dat has been backed up many times. Although once I send my bitcoins to my new electrum wallet, that will be useless right?
Or were you saying I should backup electrum somehow before I send coins? How exactly should I go about making that backup? I want to make sure it is future proof, so that even if the network changes through updates long in the future, or if electrum completely disappears from the internet, I will still be able to move/access the coins.

Probably not a problem with bitcoin.
Extremely seller friendly, no worries of charge backs. Seller's dream. Though for customer satisfaction and service it might be worth it to contact the customer to verify the shipping address if the IP/address was something weird like China/texas
@_date: 2016-05-03 02:05:19
any tips on how I can abort that original payment? I have now updated to bitcoin-core's latest version, but I'm still syncing the blockchain 4 days later. It'd be great if I could just cancel that transaction so it doesn't end up getting sent to a coinbase order address that now is long expired.
@_date: 2016-05-18 14:51:41


I was wondering in case both the network changed and electrum stops development? (I believe old versions of electrum are not compatible with the network right now for example). How would I access/move the coins in that case?
@_date: 2015-03-28 06:13:21
Certainly worth it for any merchant offering about 3% off at minimum for bitcoin since you have no credit processing fee. Plus zero charge back risk.
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:17:41
For the merchant using PayPal you also get to accept payments without paying a sometimes relatively expensive merchant account fee to a credit card processor.

Yes that seems to be what happened. There was no fee when I sent it. What will happen with that transaction then? I am pretty sure my wallet shows the btc has been sent out. The person receiving says they can't find any record of it and neither can I on the blockchain.info site. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 15:00:08
It does sound like another wallet would be ideal for me, but my question for things like electrum and mycelium, which dont download the blockchain --
What happens to my wallet/bitcoins if I leave it in one of those for like 2 years, and come back and they have stopped development on these wallets? Or, lets say their service and website goes down tomorrow and nobody hears from the developers again. Is my btc safe and can I still move it to another wallet?
