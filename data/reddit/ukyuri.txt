Yes, that's true..I wish that was something you could put a price on...

I use my account on bittrex, and kraken before that...
I have tabtrader on my phone and my accounts linked to it by API key.
It works for what I do, but I am a HODL convert...

That!...it counts more then gold, imo.

Land somewhere else, and move out of the way. Somewhere cheap and sunny. Small community where you can introduce everyone to cryptos and live an happy life.
...my dream, at least...

In my experience and the way I use it, 
Bank&gt;revolut&gt;coinbase, 
The first step is instantaneous, the second takes few hours...I can't say how it works with localbitcoins as I never had experiences with it.

Revolut works for me

I haven't, but it seems that revolut business sells itself as a cryptocurrency friendly banking system. in reality is a top up card that works through an app on your phone, gives you the (great in my opinion) possibility to exchange in many currencies instantaneously (including some cryptos) at market rates.
It also seems to be one of the few gateways that (is/still) works when withdrawing in the UK.
My bank also blocked my debit cards several times when buying crypto, and that made me try revolut instead.
I am sure someone else can confirm the other use case scenarios I have not tried, like moving funds through different accounts or large withdraws

I hope it drops too..for a short while..but I won't sell for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:58:58
Yes yes yes...me gonna buy more!
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:03:33
Thanks for the offer but I humbly refuse..
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:52:58
I hope it drops a bit more. by Sunday, I wanna buy some more at a discount. Then it can go through the ceiling at pleasure
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:30:24
If it does I'll buy more than I should actually do
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:09:13
Wow...don't be so hard with yourself...you still can buy .005 now but I am sure your butt won't hurt any less
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:32:50
...also if it goes over 3.5k...I'll end up buying more then I actually should...!
I'm a lost case
