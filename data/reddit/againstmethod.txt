No because gold has intrinsic value beyond speculation. The computer you're using right now has gold in it, because it's a good conductor and it doesn't tarnish/corrode. Thin layers of it can be used as lubricants in certain challenging environments (like space). It can be applied in thin layers to block radiation (like the visor of a space suit).
The reality is that adherents of Bitcoin regularly conflate technological innovation/politics (blockchain, decentralization), long term investment, speculation, and currency utility together to satisfy whatever slant they feel like espousing that day -- or to justify to themselves that they aren't partaking in risky behavior.
I think an objective person has to accept that the speculation and political functions of Bitcoin are dominant -- to the point that its use as a long term investment or currency is suspect. So i dont think comparing it against other purely speculative instruments is so far fetched, including collectible toys.

I guess I didn’t relegate BTC to a day trading shit coin like you apparently have.  But if we’ve all given up on long term viability then great. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:07:18
Putting him back in the fiat boat.  Not wholly convinced that it's pragmatic unless there is a market for BTC that you can trade in readily.
And Ive seen stats claiming that up to 50+% of the world still doesn't use the internet on a regular basis, if at all.  The remaining 50% probably has widely varying levels of tech savvy.  
I believe Venezuela is at around 60% internet use.  I think it's safe to say that at least 50% fo that country is not prepared to use computers as part of their daily trade regimen.
If you live in a world where only the US and Europe exist with 90% of their populations online and high literacy, etc -- then sure i can see how you may convince yourself that BTC is viable now -- but that is not this worlds reality.
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:10:04
Well we had the great depression, and we didn't go away from fiat.  Venezuela's fiat is worth the price of toilet paper and they haven't embraced coins.  Seems like a stretch to me.

@_date: 2018-09-11 13:17:20
Bitcoin can't be counterfeited. We agree on that.
Bitcoin is inflated and deflated for profit on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.
Bitcoin has saved zero lives and zero economies.  If anything it has allowed technically astute individuals to make money off of slightly-less technically astute individuals.  That is the sum total of it's achievements to date.
Fiat/gold have taken man kind from prehistory to current day, and enabled the existence of bitcoin in the first place.  It has a 10000+ year track record of success.  Standard of living improved, life expectancy increased, population increased.
You do not need to make up fairy tales or rewrite history to support bitcoin. It is a technological improvement on the piece-wise structure that makes up modern fiat economies -- that's it.  It's not a religion and it's not going to save or destroy the world if it does or doesn't exist. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 11:19:48
The likelihood of an alternative disruptive technology superseding bitcoin before that happens is highly probable. 
You may very well lose your entire investment.  You’d be better off speculating.

Not sad.  Predictable.  It’s the people posting fantasy in places like here that set your expectations unreasonably. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:02:47
I think BTC can be a good hedge if you think a particular fiat is going to flop hard.  But not as a replacement for all fiat.  That is fantasy at this point in time.

First, the rules for fiat money and the stock market is open source... it's called the law.  Those assets are more complicated than BTC.  Perhaps that's why you feel it's more "open".
Second, fiat/stocks are not only regulated, but are protected by their rules.  If someone robs your bank, the FDIC insures your loss.  If someone lies in a report to shareholders, they can be prosecuted and sued.
The dollar is accepted everywhere and is far more stable in value than a BTC.
The stock market has a 100 year track record of making money. Also the stock market is a complex body of investments, allowing for diversification.  People with different levels of risk (i.e. a new investor vs someone retiring) can change their mix intelligently. 
So BTC is not a better currency.  And BTC is not a replacement for a properly diversified wealth growth strategy.
So that leaves you with two real uses -- BTC can be 1 piece of a wealth development strategy, and it can be an instrument for speculation.
You have admitted you aren't using it for method  -- so all that is left is gambling, whether you want to admit it or not.

When i rent a car, i have a contract -- that contract contains the value of a car in the hands of the rental company until i return the vehicle.
Before or after the point when the contract is in-force, it is worth the price of a piece of paper.
Currency is the exact same thing with a longer life span, and a much more complex contract.  The US has hundreds of trillions of dollars in real net worth.  It collects billions from companies, people, the reserve, and via tariffs every year.
The fact that there is a speculative market for both is about the only thing they have in common.

Nonsense.  The MacOS + fixed hardware + company supported device drivers alone directly implies a more stable and predictable user experience.
There are simply fewer degrees of freedom - and assuming that other manufacturers can produce devices of the same physical/engineering quality (which is also nonsense) - they are still combining different components in different ways, using similarly varying software and drivers, straight down to the BIOS.
On my Mac i always know exactly what version of MacOS my system can handle, and i get it for free. And once installed everything works. No driver issues, no spotty support. No vendor specific flavor added device to device. No spyware/malware preinstalled. 
You're dreaming.

All four of those things apply to modern banking/markets based on dollars.
The only special feature of BTC is decentralization (which implicitly enables anonymity, scalability and independence from central authority).
Those are great things, but those things also have costs.  I.e. theft and price manipulation is hard or impossible to rectify because it's hard to figure out who did what and where.  And there is no governing body to which you can go for recourse.
I don't need to be anonymous.
Established markets are scaled fine for my purposes.
And I can neither escape, nor do i care about, centralization.  I have to report my income, bitcoin or not.  I am law-abiding, i don't need to mask any transactions.  And the FDIC actually gives me a degree of financial security which i appreciate.
It's fine to believe in blockchain -- but don't try to give me bullshit arguments about BTC in it's current form being better for me than dollars.  That is nonsense.

If you can't look at the price without freaking out, it's a good sign you are gambling money you can't bear to lose or you are investing with no real strategy.
Invest and hold is a fine strategy when you have strong historical data supporting that move, like the DJIA:
But when you have very limited history, and you are dealing with disruptive technologies, investing and holding becomes less sound.
I don't think anyone knows enough about BTC to buy and forget it yet.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:10:08
Yes. Having as little information as possible has always been a sound strategy.  Especially for volatile investments.

I've just started reading the sub recently, but from an outside perspective it seems that the posts are pretty uniform.
Half of them are MtGox/failure analysis that goes nowhere. 
The other half seem to be people who own bitcoins trying to convince themselves that the currency has a future and isn't as risky as some have implied it is. 
Both of those things may be true, but the way it's expressed on here seems like self-soothing behavior.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:28:43

I'm sorry, but if I'm tech savvy criminal, I would accept payment in Bitcoin all day and twice on Sunday. I would be a fool to accept any regulated currency under such conditions.
But in the end, many of the "straight" BTC users are breaking the law as well as I think it's more than fair to assume they aren't paying taxes on BTC derived income. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:10:57
Perhaps if you all manned up to the ethical ramifications of Bitcoin, they would have to stop tossing it in your collective faces.
The fact is someone certainly could rent out child sex slaves with Bitcoin and would never have to worry about anyone finding the money. It's basically like government currency with baked-in laundering.
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:25:03
The performance of stocks in the aggregate is well established.  What you think about individual stock situations is irrelevant to your ability to use them to create wealth for your future self.
As for inflation, there are real economic reasons (i.e. GDP growth) that cause it. The value of our money is actually tied to productivity and trade, unlike BTC:
 
If BTC actually attained supremacy and started being used for real country-to-country trade, it would suffer inflation just like the dollar does.
As for you not losing money, that would mean you have been buying bitcoin slowly for a long time, or that you made a large BTC purchased before the spike.  
Either way it proves nothing about the value of BTC as an investment going forward, especially given the fact that it's been tanking for months.

Actually I would expect that most democrats would actually down vote it because they believe in taxation as a means to support the less fortunate -- and an unregulated currency doesn't allow them to do that.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:38:08
Yeah, but Bitcoins don't require laundering and can't be sniffed out by dogs. If physical currency is such a problem for them, an unmanaged digital currency would downright make them powerless.
But that's the point, no? To take away their power, both to control your future and, by extension, to enforce their laws.

@_date: 2018-10-17 12:06:43
This is actually a very effective argument. 
Power is a function of time.  Therefore a simple arithmetic transaction will always be faster than an analogous blockchain computation. 
Also, if bitcoin is wasteful that means it’s susceptible to competing cryptos that are less so, putting the long term outlook of BTC in question to some extent. 
And yes it FUDs some people.

Not everyone who makes money does via speculation.  Actually in historical terms far more people prob lost their ass speculating than stuck it rich.  That’s why they are called the 1%.  Because it’s rare. 
And out of that 1% only a fraction of those people speculated. Many started businesses etc and worked their way into wealth.

You're talking like you have this great overlap with both the benefits of BTC, and the negative aspects of fiat arrangements.  
I would suggest that you don't have a lot of overlap with either, and you're telling yourself you do because you want to believe it.  
You're also intentionally ignoring issues with BTC trading/theft, the potential for negative affects from government intervention, and the distinct possibility that newer cryptos are going to be disruptive to BTC in the short term future.
You need to be looking at your investments in a much more sober, pragmatic way.  Just free advice you can freely ignore.

The inflation rate is flat but positive. Therefore each year prices go up some percent. After 20 or 30 years obviously things will be more expensive. 
The dollar being strong means comparatively against other currencies. They have inflation in those other currencies too so there can be inflation and the dollar can be strong if they are doing worse. 
Only if wages don’t keep up with inflation is there a problem. I think the middle and upper classes have kept up but the minimum wage earners have not until the recent attempts to increase the min. 
Either way don’t use your feelings to decide stuff. All of this information is easily findable via google. If you can’t do this basic research you shouldn’t invest in anything.

Yeah but if you sell a business' product, and that product cost you 200$ to make and you sell it for a 279$ bitcoin, you have to claim the 79$ of profit on your business taxes.
EDIT: plus whatever gain the bitcoin makes before you translate it to dollars as capital gains.

Certainly there were a number of coins mined before the ramp-up, and the people who mined and traded coins before then probably had many coins at a cheap price -- but they didnt make the price go up. 
Given that people buying bitcoin is what makes the price go up, and given that the price of Bitcoin went from nothing to the moon in like 2 months -- id say most people bought in at a price near or higher than what it is right now.
I think there is a large number of small lot investors that are upside-down on at least some if not most of their lots.

It was effective because the first part of that statement is largely correct.  Money is imperfect for sure. 
They just overestimated the draw of the tech on the average person and underestimated how easily a few smart people with money could manipulate the bitcoin market. 
I mean if you have multiple millions how hard would it be to get bitcoin headed north?  People in bitcoin are desperate for gains.  Then when they take the bait you dump what you bought at a 5 or 10 or 20 percent profit.

"The market price for a product made by a business and the prices for what it takes to create the product are (in almost all cases) completely separate."
I'm pretty sure production costs are in every planning and price setting equation in any real business.  It may not be the only variable but to claim they are disjoint is bizarre.  
Second if the price goes down not only do they make less in revenue but they make less profit per coin.  They certainly have to mine more to make the same amount of value or money. 
If the cost to produce today per coin is 3000 and I can sell for 5000 and I mine 10 coins a day I make 20000 bucks.  
If the price drops to 4000 that same day I now need to mine 20 coins to make that same 20k.  20 coins in the same period of time takes twice the compute power. 
The amount of energy and compute power used to produce profit amount A is inversely proportional to the amount of profit you can make per coin mined if the difficulty of mining is fixed over that period.

But it's not like a traditional asset.
Microsoft can go to 0, but it has intellectual property and physical assets worth billions that say that isn't true, which can later be used to redeem investors. Plus they can introduce a new product or change strategy, meaning the stock can reasonably be expected to have a different true value at a later date.
If BC goes to 0 it evaporates. It can't be liquidated -- it cant innovate, create, or develop its way out of a loss in confidence.
It can only be marketed. It has more in common with a Ponzi scheme that it does with a real asset.

It is overestimated in the short term because it's overesitmated in the long term.  No one invests in crypto now because they think it will fail in future. 
Assuming the governments won't legislate away your perceived benefits is an overestimation.  You should figure out how to embrace world order not reject it. You can't win that fight. 
Assuming BTC will be the crypto of the future is an overestimation.  You should be investing in crypto companies and services not a specific coin. 
Assuming that protective tech will advance faster than offensive tech is an overestimation. Especially if government actors get involved. You should plan for loss not assume it won't happen. Especially if you decentralize. 
I'm sorry I see the btc vision of the future but it has so many basic logical flaws I have to reject it.

Over 52 weeks that would be 5200.00 invested,  If the investor is 22 years old, and works until 67, using the previous 45 years (1973-2018) of DJIA history to get an average yearly return of 7.881%, that money would be worth approx 157,886.70$ at retirement.
This ignores dividends and additional contributions in subsequent years.

@_date: 2018-12-14 18:30:37
The 45 years was just showing the impact that 100$ saved now could have when you need it at retirement.  
At 10% yearly return your money doubles every 7 years.  So if delayed putting that money in for seven years up front, that means you will have half as much when you retire. It's no joke.
Lots of people don't have the money to retire, and one of the most reported regrets those people have is that they didn't save enough when they were young.
