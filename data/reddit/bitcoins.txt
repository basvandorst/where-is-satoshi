It tickles!

About a month ago I also notified my mortgage broker/underwriters of my bitcoins, although they said I was slam dunk without them. My family moves in august15!
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:46:29
Now gamble!

@_date: 2014-03-16 20:03:17
How much do you hold?
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:22:14
I'm on the beta team and requested they change it before mtgox halted trading. They said it was a work in progress then
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:45:14
So you're saying theres a chance!
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:14:08
Really depends on the government :) I agree
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:10:48
I dunno how anyone is gonna beat this bid...
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:36:18
Could this be the stolen mtgox coins?
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:31:42

Don't give him real money. Send him an email that sounds legit that claims to have $5,000 in bitcoins. He'll spend a lot of time trying to claim them then get frustrated it was fake. He's dumb enough to fall for this or aleast a Nigerian Prince scam

Mr potato! You back in mke yet ?
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:15:29
No problems here
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:45:01
Only reason it exists is press and people keep talking about it
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:59:23
I say it already has, been using it for 3 years for purchases

That was me begging for someone to cast the spell "spirit of the wolf" so you run faster 
@_date: 2014-07-30 04:19:09
My theory of the death of bitcoin is government messing with hacking/back door into GitHub , putting a tiny change in without anyone noticing and setting it up for a zero day crash. It will recover and fork etc etc sure...

I disagree, my theory is that volume probably goes down due to those with liquid available and actively watching pumping in their maximum possible as it rises, then has to wait for more pay checks during the volume dip period.

He probably has people advise him on all topics such as emerging trends 
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:58:19
God I hope those coins never see the light again 
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:49:07
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:32:07
Great response!
@_date: 2014-09-13 18:23:19
He has nothing to gain from doing any of this but lessons learned. He got his BTC back. Sure it was shitty I agree but moving on it the correct answer IMO 
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:35:22

@_date: 2019-08-20 05:32:32
I was a young lad
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:28:03
I thought I read they accept bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:57:21
.10 usd

Adam back, although you have him on the list under an alias already 
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:00:23
I don't wanna doxx, but satoshi is on that list 
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:48:59
Bitcoin would recover... but yeah litecoin would grab a big chunk of people, I own some litecoin for that very fallback possibility 
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:11:16
9 years ago was fun for sure
@_date: 2017-04-30 09:11:01
Big fan, didn't mean to imply you weren't around, trust me, glad you are =) wanted you listed as here.
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:26:21

Litecoin has low fees 
@_date: 2015-10-27 00:12:16
Let me know if you would like me to do an AMA
@_date: 2015-11-03 05:11:45
As Bitcoin CEO, this is most correct 
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:39:14
Board of directors voted me in as CEO

Startups are bringing on talent, it takes a few moments for that talent to show breakthrough ideas regarding Bitcoin and the blockchain. Once a few of those genius ideas are backed by proof of concepts the investors throw in billions to create their life legacy.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:45:21
I know who Satoshi is and he is not a we, we implied the work based on those before him and the community of cryptonerds
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:46:59

@_date: 2013-12-01 02:24:54
Why not both?
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:59:45
Any NSA/snowden leaks on truecrypt?
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:33:50
