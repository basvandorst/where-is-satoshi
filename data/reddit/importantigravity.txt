Awesome app. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. I will definetly talk about it to my circle.
I can't use it yet until NEO wallet tracking is added though. But I'll be waiting for that update which I imagine is coming. (BTW, would be better to have the coins listed in alphabetical order).

Wouldn't a smart hacker wait for everyone using the thing and *then* steal the funds?
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:49:54
I am now convinced.

If you really want an opinion about him, don't use this sub as the only source. back it up with other external info.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:11:40
Read his flair and have a laugh. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:40:32
Could be an alternative. thanks

I've been here and there for a long time now. And even I don't know which is better for bitcoin now. The debate is so full of spammed and fluff on both sides that I got sick of it and am waiting this out with other coins and fiat. Can't take the drama anymore.

Sure, I'm not saying it isn't safe. 
I'm just afraid of the technical/difficulty overhead for them. I don't want to scare them with 'complicated' procedures if they are willing to buy now. I'd rather ease them into it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:05:03
Didn't think of it. Good idea. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:34:57


not possible at this point; I don't live in Chile anymore and although I could buy it for them with my money, I would rather they do it. :)
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:04:28
This is actually for my sister/mother. I don't think localbitcoins is the best advice to give them. :)
Otherwise, thanks for the idea.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:47:37


I'm not sure that's a bad thing you're saying. Was it meant to be? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:33:05
...With ~8% higher market price.

MANY people in my circles think this. 
I just ask them what you call a Ponzi scheme where all of the participents are too, Ponzi schemes?
The banking system :)

How many answered? 
@_date: 2017-04-02 10:19:49
I see. This bet is fucking idiotic. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:06:40
To be honest, we see more of those personal attacks here than there. It's a shame really. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:42:18
True. OMG these people, they'll say anything that suits their cause. No regard for facts or truth. When will this debate be factual and less emotional?
@_date: 2017-04-02 09:27:59


Can you explain this better? It interests me way more than this stupid post. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 09:30:59
So much fucking hate in this sub reddit at times. Must feel awful to be Ver and read some of these comments.
Get a grip, people.
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:20:26
If I were at a party and he answered this same comment, I would pee myself of laughter.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:28:33
Did you really feel the need to call me a retard? 
People like you are the reason bitcoin might fail one day and why people are leaving this space for other, more friendly places. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:58:25
Care to explain a little better? What does the 2008 oil crash have to do with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:51:17
What are you, 12?
