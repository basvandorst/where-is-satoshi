Looks neat. Can someone tell me how I get USD in there? I've been looking and looking but for the life of me, can't figure it out. (Wire payments are broken, btw... not a good sign).
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:52:44
Cool - I'll buy some from you at $4 when it gets there.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:20:45
Oh yeah? Has this happened to you? Or are you just making it up?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:06:02
I'm talking about prices. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:44:37
Wow, you're really uneducated in Finance. Allow me to help:


Bitcoin is more or less an FX instrument (except that it has no government backing and thus is inherently worthless).
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:49:00
All market forecasts are nothing more than pulling numbers out of one's ass. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:22:41
aaaaaaand $149. 
Burn, baby, burn!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:35:51
$174 on btc-e. Only exchange that has held up today.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:20:03
OMG that's hilarious!! 
Tell me why else it's different this time!!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:36:24
Maybe lag on Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:59:32
Oh yeah, you have no idea. But the options markets were really clean in comparison to the equity market makers. Now those guys were crooked... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:44:18
Having an alternative payment method - particularly a fringe one - isn't going to do much to increase demand when there are other options which are just as good. 
Where bitcoin will shine is with purchasing illegal goods and services that you don't want anyone else to know about. Big deal.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:54:18
I was a market maker on an options exchange 15 years ago.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:17:25
There's a fight going on at $169 right now. If it breaks through it will keep going until around $100...
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:31:41
Hey, thanks for explaining to me how charts work. Man, I can't believe I've been looking at them since the 80's and never thought to factor in time scale.
I wonder if a chart's appearance might make a difference if you altered the Y-axis in some way? Perhaps by changing the scale or altering the aspect ratio?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:13:00
$178 bid and the buyers are drying up. We might see $100 today.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:04:02
3022.44 sec (50 minutes) lag you mean?
I just saw a trade go down at $164...
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:03:43
LOLOLOL oh man, you sound just like everyone back in the dotcom days with all of their rationalizations.
It's rising in value this fast due to artificially created shortage (which is common in all non-Fiat currencies) and a ton of media hype inflating which is inflating demand. Everyone is hoarding so it doesn't really matter how many companies accept it because the real (non-speculative) transactions are drying up by the minute.
It's also really complicated, scams about, and there are a whole lot of ways for the casual user to lose their money (I read at least three posts on this today, in fact).
So yeah... bitcoin kind of sucks.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:29:56
You're right. Poker chips could be melted down for plastic so they have at least a little value.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:00:34
So you admit that you pick on handicapped people?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:26
That seems practical.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:58
It's a bubble. And it just crashed. 
BTC is currently down 50%. The very simple psychology of markets is falling into play and the price is going down even further... then it's not coming back up again for a very long time.
Edit: $111 now.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:09:56
Nope, I won't touch bitcoin. I'm just enjoying watching as I've been through a number of bubbles and this is so far the best one because of all of the smug hipsters who are going to lose a fortune in the immediate future.
&lt;&lt;munch, munch&gt;&gt; (popcorn)
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:31:50
Says the guy on a subreddit touting an over-valued, over-hyped financial instrument which has no inherent value and will likely cause a whole lot of suffering in the very near term future.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:48:38
That's simply not true. I provided specific dates and prices. Nothing more is necessary. How I got there is my business.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:13:53
It's in the $120s now. We're looking a big red candle ... wouldn't be surprised if this is the push down to $100.
Dammit, I really wish there was an exchange that could be trusted. I wanted to buy puts so bad but everything related to this currency is so shady.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:38:03
Nice guess. Good luck doing that in volume. Why not just take USD? Its the global standard already?
Oh wait, because you want your nerd fantasy to come true. Got it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:12:30


I think it's the end of the bitcoin era. Meltdown in progress. I was thinking 99 by tomorrow morning but I'm starting to think that guess is too high.
You make great points though... you can't have a fixed amount of a currency and expect to build an economy off of it for all of your reasons plus a few others. Bitcoin is a good demonstration of what would happen if Ron Paul got his way and got us back on the gold standard.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:01:46
Cool. Fun experience and it was cheap, too. Can't beat that. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:35:24
Nope, I sent out an email chain to my mom telling her to short bitcoin on bitfinex. It's just a matter of time now before we take it all back from you.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:47:06
Models are just guesses.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:10:55
It could be there by Friday at this rate.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:04:16
You mean, once there's no more demand except from the tiny minority of people who actually understand bitcoin and believe in its future, the price will somehow go back up?
Makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:49:01
You don't need to see the model.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:51:18
That's actually pretty sound reasoning. Much better than the "I'll believe you if I can see your model" tards.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:44:45
I don't think you do.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:04:33
LOL ... this thing is going to 5. Bet it's at 99 tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:39:18
Bitcoin is a resource like poker chips are a resource.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:36:55
Wow, how sad do you have to be to downvote a 5 month old! ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:02:12
This is just a terrible submission.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:21:16
$101 on BTC-e right now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:46:27
Haha - so the 2-7% fees to convert USD into bitcoin are somehow more palatable than the invisible fees (typically .25%) merchants pay to the credit card companies to accept cards?
Your protest is really contrived. Why not just pay in cash? It's accepted by everyone, difficult to trace, and isn't suffering from hyperdeflation like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:11:55
It's funny you ask. Quite a bit actually.
When I was just starting out, I managed to get my hands on a heavily Xeroxed copy of the first Elliot Wave book. Some pages were missing but most of it was there. 
I studied and studied and studied. Put everything into practice. I even created software that could overlay the various formulas onto a live chart so I could predict resistance (this was back in '94 mind you, so no small feat).
I then proceeded to get my ass kicked in the market. It was all bullshit.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:55:23
I'm just curious, do you bully challenged kids at school as well?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:23:37
That's usually because its not lagging. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:14:40
It's like I'm living in 1999 again. So fun!
Just wait, the butthurt here is going to be immense.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:14:25
Instawallet was just the first step in the plan to corner the bitcoin market. There's 41,000+ bitcoins that can't be liquidated for 90 days.
Next up is MtGox which closed down in order to prevent a massive liquidation (the bitcoin equivalent of a limit down day).
This currency is so shady. I can't believe anyone is putting any money in it. This is going to be an entirely different subreddit next week.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:49:51
Goddammit there is really just *no* way to short this market. I'll buy you a beer anyway if we ever bump into each other.
So I've been looking into this a bit more and the fact that all of the media attention is just now hitting its peak suggests that we might have a bit more runway before the top. I posted elsewhere about my model which suggests $250 by April 25th. I would then expect a major correction (30%+) followed by another brief run up. Then the major pain starts.
Of course, nobody has a crystal ball but this sure is a lot of fun. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:55:03
Nope. Tried it all last week and gave up after seeing how seedy it was (no wire payments? REALLY?). I won't put my hard earned money into a foreign business, much less one that is over the second the owner gets hit by a bus.
Guess my prudence is paying off. I have my millions in the bank and the Instawallet guys have yours (I mean theirs). 
Oh, I also still have a couple of bitcoins or so from my early mining days. Guess I should dig that hard drive out.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:48:30
Not really. 
A) you won't be deciding on April 25th ... it will either happen or not. 
B) you can't decide to get access to my model.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:11
$136 now. It's like watching the dotcom bubble in fast forward. Awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:40:39
This is a circlejerk subreddit so why not? ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:17:15
Yeah, that's the problem. There are no protection measures in place. So unless you are sitting on mined coins or ones you bought at a much cheaper price, the odds of getting scammed are pretty darn high.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:34:53
I think most of the people here will end up losing money on bitcoins. Probably a better question is to ask how they will work off the debt they went into when they took out loans to buy at $200.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:15:41
Looks like they may be the lucky ones... BTC is down to $124 now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:08:37
I would say the odds are strong that it will break through $100 today.
Lots and lots of scared money at this point as well as some big holders who have a lot at stake. There is a big wall of buyers at the natural support point ($100) so to sell a big block, they are going to need to generate some confidence. I would expect perhaps a run back up to the $150s or even $180s. People will start falling over themselves to buy again at which point everything will get unloaded. 
The $100 buy wall will crumble at that point and we'll quickly drop to $30.
Or maybe something else will happen ;-)
Edit: and 49 minutes later we had a run up to the $120s and now we're at $80. Dropping rapidly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:12:17
$123 now. 
I predict it will break $100 in the next couple of hours.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:41:56
Why should you be nervous? Bitcoin will be at 250 by April 25th. What's to worry about?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:25:13
You should buy some. As much as you can.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:06:21
They arent all dumb, you know. Bitcoin is pretty much based on nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:27:39
Damn you for posting this... this has been my secret guide to the bitcoin bubble. Hopefully this post won't make it past "New".
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:41:05
You can keep your character. I prefer your money.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:49:53
That's actually a great reason for a downvote. I personally think bitcoin is stupid and should go to $0. I also think speculation is idiotic. My point here is simply to prove it. I will reveal the model at a later date.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:31:58
Why would retailers adopt a currency that doesn't have a stable value? Unless they want to get into the FX business, it's not a good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:38:52
A 60% drop is a crash by any definition.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:19:40
That's not paid. It's what newsworthy and popular.
You do realize buying bitcoins isn't that smart of a thing to do, right?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:21:32
Miner_Willy just admitted he picks on handicapped kids at school.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:57:20
Sure, what odds are you laying down? I could be in for $10k or so.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:29:29
But probably none.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:25:33


Sounds like a great currency. I'm sure the masses will adopt it.


Pretty much every currency is based on trust. Bitcoin has none.


Seems like a very shaky foundation if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:02:23
Didn't see that coming. 
Been warning you guys, I hope you liquidated your positions because most of you aren't going to get the chance.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:33:23
99 by tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:25:06
I hope you cashed out when you said you did. It's almost down 50% now and there's no sign of resistance.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:52
And here's the bull trap... $130 to $190 in 60 seconds. 
And back down to $162 before I could submit this comment. Holy fuck.
Ride's over fellas. I congratulate those of you who sold out in the past few days. You're going to look like geniuses soon.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:32:03
So I could show my grandkids an example of a failed currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:59:22
And currently 32% lower than we were a few hours ago. 
Prices go down a lot faster than they go up!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:11:57
But... what about *Hitler*???
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:02:57
Yes, give it a shot and let us know how it goes!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:43:23
Bitcoin is already a failed currency because you can't make more. Look up the causes of the Great Depression and it should become fairly obvious why BTC is worth $0.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:51:09
Down, down, down to $30... probably today!
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:13:20
No. None of the things mentioned elsewhere in this thread are in bubbles.
There is no exception to the rule that I'm aware of. Every bubble pops. People here are ignorantly equating higher value based on intrinsic worth, inflation, and population growth with speculative inflation.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:03:09
I find two things absolutely hilarious about this:
* A bunch of nimrods downvoted me yesterday for this post. Check out the comments!
* Most of you who are sitting on a ton of bitcoins are not going to be able to liquidate them. The butthurt on this reddit we're going to see soon (tomorrow? Friday?) is going to be glorious.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:24:24
It's different this time!
Just like the internet was different than everything else that came before it. Dow 20,000 by 2000!
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:53:34
And if I pooped gold, I'd be a billionaire.
It's fun the construct outlandish analogies, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:48:33
$165 now on btc-e. $175... oy. Can't keep up.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:46:27
Actually, my brother is autistic. That was a really offensive comment.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:40:45
Yup... I was a professional floor trader. I'm telling you that I've seen a lot of plays go down that have since been made illegal. It's all fair game with bitcoin and I guarantee you people are taking advantage of it while they can.
Let the fleecing begin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:02:55
You aren't arbitraging. You are day trading.
That's the problem with this reddit and 99% of the people who are gambling on bitcoin... they come off as idiots most of the time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:54:51
Actually a new panic is setting in now... $145 and dropping.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:01:13
$400M is not a big gold trade.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:51:56
Bitcoin should hit 500 by May 16th:
So what if there's been a parabolic rise? This time it's different.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:51:23
You guessed wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:46:33
Yeah. That seems trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:19:12
Bingo. Welcome to the reality of a non-Fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:13:29
And only down 75% from two days ago! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:53:30


You haven't been paying attention then.


There's no way in hell you are making your money back before a couple of years... if that.


The price will probably drop to below $30, then bounce back up a bit. It will continue to decline at a slower rate and flatten out in the next couple of weeks. Everyone will lose interest and it will stay within a narrow trading range for 1-2 years.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:04:15
You should have sold yesterday. Now is probably your last chance.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:34:07
$79 on Bitstamp right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:18:34
Volume also drives prices down. I think it's correlated more with the magnitude of price changes than the direction.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:41:29
It already did ... It was $168 a few minutes ago.
