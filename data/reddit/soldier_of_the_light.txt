It's a form of concern trolling.  People will link or or on super pro Bitcoin posts like this in an attempt to try and shame people from posting pro bitcoin memes in the future.  Anyone who has been here long enough has noticed this trend
Edit:  Struck a nerve, thank you for the downvotes

My squad got in late so Gramatik was our first set of the weekend - I was geeking when he played Satoshi Nakamoto.  I didn't realize he had these visuals though haha that's awesome

Too many apathy trolls in here who are too relaxed about the small mem pool.  We must convince miners to activate integrated participant to solve this problem asap

I agree, a large amount of people are rejected &amp; I agree that scaling solutions are needed.  But calling $5 fees a "complete and utter failure" is an oxymoron.  If people are willing to pay $5 fees consistently with the limited supply of block size available, that must mean there is huge demand.  I don't know in what world you live in where huge demand = "complete and utter failure."  With that much demand comes even more pressure for scaling, whether that's through segwit+lightning, blocksize increase, alt coins, or something not invented yet:  The demand will be matched somehow, someway.  Basic market forces

I've been here long enough to tell the difference and thankfully so have a lot of other holders.  Mempool spikes, bunch of posts appear complaining about long confirmation times and you get posts like these with a bunch of comments bashing Bitcoin, core, talks of hardforks, &amp; talks of altcoins being better.  Yadda yadda yadda.  I get that there are valid concerns with scaling but this FUD and concern trolling that pops up is so obvious.  Per the OP, if fees are at $5 then that means Bitcoin is being used substantially more than today and that it is succeeding to the point that fees are so great.  More successful means more pressure to find scaling solutions, see: segwit.  There is no way all this FUD in here is justified in saying that Bitcoin is failing when the exact opposite is reality

Why does every super pro bitcoin post get filled with concern trolls trying to stamp out any super pro bitcoin sentiment?  Hmmm I wonder why that might be... hmmmmmmmmmmm HMMMMMM


Another thread over run by shills to drown out pro Bitcoin sentiment.  Top comments praising inflation and Central banks, lol wtf... Y'all need to be more subtle in your shilling

Agreed.  Also, threads like these usually get bombarded with concern trolls who try to destroy any pro-bitcoin, anti-fed, anti-inflation sentiment.  This thread appears to be skirting beneath (((THEIR))) radar 
edit:  Like clockwork, has shown up 3 hours after my comment to shoot down the top comment with magically 20+ upvotes, referring to us as crazy with basic economics on his side lmao.
