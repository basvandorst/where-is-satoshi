Good idea, haven't checked this in a few weeks.
Wish you could use BTC with steam
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:18:58
You are a kindly man :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:38:24
Great idea. If you still have some of that BTC I wouldn't mind fooling around with it to share either! Currently I only have a couple bucks left.
Where would you recommend I do this? I don't have facebook anymore 
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:19:12
Got that right!
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:06:11
Hey, thanks man! I'll try and put it to good use.
I've thought this for a long time now. Wonder what it would take to see valve accept BTC. We should fire off some emails, wouldn't hurt 
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:36:11
Not a bad plan at all, thanks!
I'm getting some NN-DMT but wil do that with the change :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 06:06:37


I have no sweet clue. Trying to hold prices down?
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:36:28
Wish I could go PayPal to BTC. Can anyone help?
@_date: 2014-06-10 06:05:45
Fuck em.
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:54:00
Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:16:23


I'm off to Hollywood
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:18:02
Cool, thanks
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:27:06
 I'll give it a shot. Any other options?
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:30:18
S'all good, me too man wasn't trying to be rude.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:26:50
Okay, I'll give it a shot too.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:21:57
Hell no! I would't touch that coin in it's prime I sure as hell won't be touching it as it dies :)
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:27:05
Right. If I could find someone trustworthy it would be fine though. 
I've bought BTC with PP a few times before.
 I try to avoid PP like the plague, but sometimes you have to use it.
@_date: 2014-06-10 06:06:04
Mos def.
I love my BTC ATM. So convenient. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 06:26:07


Idiots. I hate how stupid people are. So hard to get them on to new ideas.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:23:44
Thanks mate
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:52:13
I've bought BTC via PP numerous times and the only time I have been scammed was when I sold coins over LBC, got a chargeback.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:12:26
I can't wait! Nice to see wealth used appropriately 
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:28:24
cash value or BTC?
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:34:34
lol they should start selling that stuff with a package of tinfoil and directions to make a hat.
@_date: 2014-05-16 06:34:52
I was responding to, but more to people like this in general.


 Another operating system?
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:51:28
Uhhh what? If this isn't the place to ask, point me in the right direction then. No need to be an arse. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:21:01
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:20:48
Get off your high horse, you're clearly the scumbag here asshole. Self righteous cunt. 
I do substances on occasion, yep. So by your logic I shouldn't use bitcoin? Seems pretty stupid in my opinion. I'm glad most bitcoin enthusiasts aren't such prudes or the currency would have no hope at all.
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:37:50
I wouldn't mind fooling around with it :)
