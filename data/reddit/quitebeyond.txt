I tried to open a channel with you, but I'm getting some error messages. [error](
Maybe it's my client. I tried a channel around 3$. I will try later. Cheers

Hey lightning friends,
Check out my lightning lapp 
And let me know what you think
@_date: 2019-03-04 10:49:30
Here you go:

It's a beta version. I had several options and I had no time to implement everything yet. In an earlier version I had the copy field integrated, but dropped it for now. I might reimplement it soon. Thanks for checking it out.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:25:02
hey thank you! I am really sorry, that it didn't work. Thank you for testing it! If you want to you can retry it and if it is not working you'll get all sats back. edit: I think the "open link in wallet" is broken and it doesn't do anything. Eclair wallet should work  - I need to bring back the invoice as a string. I removed it in the latest version.... soon.

I was currently on a flea market in Berlin and I accepted Bitcoin via Lightning [ Actually it's quite funny to talk to people about bitcoin and especially lightning when they see the sign. The interest is there, but a lot of people are not ready yet. 
So spreading the word in the realworld is very good as people get direct answers to their questions - face to face.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:39:57
Sorry for spoiling the party :)  
but the shop works fine - especially for testing - [shop.quitebeyond.com]( you can order stuff for just 1 satoshi!
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:18:35
no prob! have a good one.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:53:10
Thanks for the feedback. I'm not sure why, but it seems to not work when there wasn't a payment before. It should work now - I'll send you back your sats - please PM me your payment info about 1000 sat and it will come back to you.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:43:47
You didn't send me an invoice yet, like I asked for in the last post. Of course I'll send it back.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:08:59
Hey there - I have sent it back!
~~btw - I didn't get a PM. Just checked it.~~
Alright! Now I saw it as a chat message.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:14:05
Actually it should work. For most people it works, sometimes it just says payment received. I will lower the price, so it is easier to test it out. My guess is, that something is blocking the websocket connections on some browsers. Well, still early days. My shop at [shop.quitebeyond.com]( (lightning only) should work without problems. Thanks nevertheless for testing!
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:15:54
hmmm - I just see one new payment, one tried.   
Please paste your invoice and the Id of the payment you did and you'll have the sats back in no time!
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:34:24
Well, I am not confident that it works perfectly fine - as it is stated on the website. I just tried it and it worked for me. If you want to test it, just do it. If it doesn't work I am refunding 100% of your payments but I am not betting here.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:23:02
You can try out my lightning experiment at  
If you facing any problems, please let me know
Or 
edit: (it might not work with the first payment) - so it's still in early beta stages.

@_date: 2019-06-30 22:19:57
Great. Incoming channel would be great :)
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:37:54
I really like how polished the app experience is. Great job!

please let me know if you have any questions.

@_date: 2019-01-13 15:26:54
Hey  - no - you can pay this with lightning. Accepting BTC on chain needs to be disabled - ~~it's not implemented yet imho - you need to chose lightning payment after you click the payment button.~~
fixed. You now pay everything via lightning under a specific value.


~~This is pretty early stage - so please change BTC on the upper right to lightning.~~

Hi! Maybe start with a video: 
And go from there. If you have further questions - just ask.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:26:35
Amazing! Thank you kind redditor!
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:57:28
Great! Thank you very much!
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:37:30
Thanks MrKukks! I put this on the funding page.

Hey there I sent a file up in the sky yesterday - could someone try to get it via satellite? 
the number: 42242d18-0cf8-49c5-b206-7e1adbf0c27a

Very kind! Thank you!

Hi there - thanks for your donation :). 
You can begin here and look where it takes you: [
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:34:45
Cool - thank you! :) I added it to the post to make it more clear.
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:55:31
Thanks for trying it out! Really appreciate it. The sounds are integrated in the crowdfunding app right now - it's from quake and just meant to be as a demo placeholder - so something happens on the page when the invoice was paid. Sorry if they creeped you out :). Will be optional in the future.
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:48:18
oh! Thank you! Fixed it ;).
@_date: 2019-09-15 14:43:41
That's great news!
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:22:56
I built this bitcoin lightning shop some time ago: [shop.quitebeyond.com]( you can purchase stuff starting at 1satoshi. It's on mainnet and it's running with btcpay server. Feel free to come over and shop! And it's just for fun and testing with super tiny, small amounts.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:01:12
Hey, it's actually WordPress and WooCommerce with some custom edits.
