Hmmm... this took an unexpected turn that makes me weary. I thought your goal was to make 15btc. What’s in it for you if you do it for free?
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:40:16
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:31:20
Parents probably bought in at 19k$ and now lost their retirement money
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:49:38
19k is great, but 11k is almost as good!
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:40:16
Wouldn’t difficulty drop if price goes down, since mining would be less profitabable and they would el her switch to alt coins or sell rigs?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:26:04
Go to coinbase and create an account. You will have to link the account to your bank account.
Go to the btc wallet in coinbase and get a request /receive address (it can be a QR code the other person can take a pic of or a long text of numbers and letters, they are both the same).
Give this address to the other person and tell him to send the btc there. 
Once he is done, you will need to wait around 1 hour to receive it (more or less).
Once the btc is in your wallet, you can sell and the money will be deposited in your bank account within a couple days.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:49:10
Are you calling short term gains (25-28%) as income? And long term gains as capital gains (15%)?
Maybe it’s just the naming throwing me off.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:43:46
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:59:35
You have to transfer it then. Get the address of the receiving wallet and go to nicehash and send the btc to that address. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:18:42
Awesome. You didn’t say how much!
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:07:44
Hmmm.... seems like if you can back up it defeats the whole purpose of 2fa. So if authy gets hacked then what?
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:36:11
That seems fairly long. Could it be they submitted low priority?
You can check the blockchain explorer to see where it’s at
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:16:20
So are most decent sites password. The point of 2fa is that you have a device that is with you for secondary authentication.
Just seems like you are putting a lock on the door and leaving the key in.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:56:24
That doesn’t make sense. What are you trying to do with your btc? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:42:57
Great comment here!
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:11:00
Can I use the spot in your brain to store my back up phrase in case I forget it? How much would that cost? It’s just 12 random words.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:05:58
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:47:02
Thanks for the response. It does limit you to a few coins, correct?
I’m trying to figure out what to do and I honestly feel it’s really difficult to follow other than biting the bullet and getting the hardware

Cardano isn’t speculative...
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:09:51
It’s the number of coins in circulation, times the current coin valuation
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:42:35
Oh I didn’t realize your not OP.
We I think it’s unfair for you to do it for free. How about we agree to a number? Don’t gouge me. Something around 1btc is probably ok.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:39:21
Found is already the past tense of find. No need to add the “ed” at the end. Still wrong, but probably finded would have made more sense.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:25:36
Is this video correct?? It states that if you sell within a year it’s accounted as income instead of capital gain. Seems wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:48:09
That’s the numbers and letters you gave the sender. Your wallet id

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:28:23
I agree with h this comment. If you are going to transact in btc, you have to talk in btc terms (ie. I owe you 0.001 btc)
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:43:58
Yeah. That’s what I would do. Weird.
Have you tried with your public address?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:14:32
So if I could put a mining node in a remote place in the world, would that increase my chances of reward, or location is not a factor?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:36:58
Why would you get this over a gpu rig? I’m trying to figure out myself
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:27:14
Low transaction volume 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:06:52
This is the correct awnser
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:27:32
Btw, mycelium wallet is only to hold the coins. It won’t allow you to convert to usd, this is why you need to use coinbase instead.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:06:44
Are you sure it’s not a browser?? Geee... thanks for clarifying that!
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:48:36
Your wallet will generate a new address with every transaction. Is it all in the same wallet? In coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:24:10
Good I’m not there yet
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:41:20
Haha so many things
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:23:55
He did say “ie. The first thing that got big...” which should have covered your concern.
Just saying.

@_date: 2018-01-25 18:45:21
You can’t mine bitcoins with a gpu rig?
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:09:47
Yes. Argentina is definitely a county were Bitcoin makes even more sense. Currency manipulation is very ingrained in economy politics.
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:12:12
How does that work? They give you a QR code to send the funds? But then it takes like 20 min for them to see the transaction, but that time you are done eating and gone...
Would like if you could explain the experience
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:59:05

Interesting. I like the note on price speculation
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:14:15
I would second this recommendation.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:41:41
Doesn’t seem like a good idea. I haven’t found a single accountant that says it’s ok. Just pay bro

Currently I see it as an investment vehicle with huge upside. If it turns into a currency then it has a couple benefits I see: low fees to move money, moving money across borders more easily and the inability of the government to control the currency and create deflation, specially in 3rd world countries.
From a day to day use you won’t notice much difference and potential bitcoin would integrate with Apple Pay and your banks, so it would probably stay in the background.
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:28:24
No. The difference is between purchase price and sell price. If you didn’t sell in 2017 then you wouldn’t be taxed on it. If you sold on 2017, you would you the price at the moment of transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:49:29
I don’t see any correlation. There is only 1 dip out of the 4 adjustments in the graph
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:57:53
I’m sure EOS people are not happy though
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:34:17
Well that is the point of 2FA. In case someone hacks your email. Seems like you missed saving the backup phrase and not really a coinbase issue.
Try authy next time or when google Authenticator gives you the backup phrase, actually save it. It’s avoid these situations.
These measures are there for a reason and if it was easy to circumvent 2FA there wouldn’t be much to it. 
Hope it’s not causing you too much trouble and you are back on track soon!
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:08:26
I thought it was pretty well done and balanced

@_date: 2018-03-17 23:48:30
Not sure how, but this sounds like a scam
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:38:15
Hmmm, somebody fact check this!
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:32:31
Yes. You would need to get the exchange for those coins. Convert the btc to dollar being a sell event and then the dollar to alt being a buy event
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:12:07
Lol at this. It’s 1.24% over the last 24hrs
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:47:50
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:04:08
I wouldn’t take it. I don’t want to get overly invested in crypto as it’s fairly volatile today. I have a good chunk of my savings invested and expecting it to pay off, but if it fails then I wouldn’t want to be all in.
In addition, at least in the US, spending in btc is almost impossible when it comes to tax season.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:37:55
Now I get it 
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:31:12

I did the same. Doubt she still remembers.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:44:51
IRS considers you are trading to USD and then buying something new. It’s like selling rice and using that money to buy a house.

This was a legit question, and if you check OPs profile he has a more than legit profile. I’m pretty confident he is not a bank shill.
It is you that is bringing conspiracy theories with no proof. I’m not saying you are wrong about what you are saying, but picking on this post is not the right approach. Do some research, post your findings and then it might be worth listening to you.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:33:13
I’m sure if you google, you can find many good blogs that cover this
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:15:57

I paid in btc though. So the btc/usd change doesn’t affect my calculation
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:05:21
I bought at 700. Still hodling
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:20:18
Just an idea: if you could just follow addresses that host more than let’s say 200 btc and alert you when they are transacting, that would be awesome 
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:49:15
Well depends how much you invest. Recovery of the investment could be anywhere from 6 months to 2 years depending on btc price, miners, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:37:03
I feel if you are dumb enough to be tricked into thinking bcash is bitcoin, then it’s on you. At least I prefer those guys buying bcash than giving their money into bitconnect. Don’t feel they would get much further than that.

If it doesn’t matter... then why say it?

@_date: 2018-02-21 14:39:30
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:57:56
I was thinking the same. If you bought the dip, you should be thanking them, not blaming them
@_date: 2018-03-12 14:57:21
This was great I thought 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:39:04
So... far left?
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:20:05
How did you restore your 2FA? Did you have the backup phrase?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:52:27
I’m not talking about one being better than the other. I’m talking about people putting money into crypto with so little understanding that they wouldn’t be able to know the difference between the two and buy one vs the other.

Nothing happens. Those btc are there existing in the ledger.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:03:28
I don't use that wallet so can't help you there. Seems the backup seed is the safest way to backup things.
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:30:45
Depends on your financial situation and how deep you want to be invested in btc.

Bitcoin cash owner Roger Ver owns bitcoin.com domain. In several occasions he tried to make the case for Bitcoin cash being the real Bitcoin and Bitcoin is what he calls Bitcoin core.
Issue/concern is that newbies might get confused by this are his tactics are rather slimey in order to push Bitcoin cash over Bitcoin.
