Yeah, it's this one, but has the error on it.

The problem with bitcoin is that it's too good a currency. A rule of econ is that bad money chases out good money from common use. Aside from the inevitable irrelevant anecdote, most of you are not actually using bitcoins, you're hoarding it. That very practice of hoarding it (with good reason, obviously) is what will put the ceiling on bitcoin.

Are you spending it? 
What percentage of the bitcoins that you own have you actually spent?

Look, I believe in Bitcoin as much as anyone else, but that's exactly the problem. I think they're good; I think they're valuable....which means I don't want to use it.  I'd wager that the vast majority of people here think exactly the same thing, otherwise you wouldn't be distraught at the falling value of bitcoin. 
The second problem is the timeless "the rich will get richer, and the poor will get poorer" pattern has already repeated itself in Bitcoin. 
I think the recent surge was driven by people thinking they could become part of a new, more democratic process, but as bitcoin has grown rapidly and transformed into a microcosm of modern finance, we now see that really nothing has changed.  The current competitiveness makes it impossible for the individual to make a profit from bitcoin, (as nearly every FAQ points out), and the only way they can scrounge a few mBTC (at a loss), makes you feel like you're being used by the power users who made massive investments in tech to decrease their risk,since they essentially reap the lion's share of group mines. 
Despite all this, I don't think it's reached it's max value yet, but people are dreaming if they think bitcoin will ever go above 10k as that would require a rate of market circulation that has never been seen with any kind of independently valuable currency.

You're wrong.  Holding it IS a problem. 
Bitcoin's entire thing is that it is a modern, superior kind of currency.  That it is a superior currency that is designed to appreciate in value, is precisely why NO ONE wants to use it. The biggest hoarders of bitcoin are precisely the ones who are capping it's value.

...But most people are. Do you think the hype is really driven by "Sweet, now I won't have to use cash?!?"
No.  The hype is being driven by "Sweet, now I can make lots of money for literally no work!"

But it passed the minimum store of value a while ago. It's now in danger of serving as _only_ a store of value.
