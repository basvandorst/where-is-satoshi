Wrong. I didn't have savings before I started investing in Bitcoin.

Congratulations! I started my Bitcoin journey in 2014. I didn't have much money to invest, so I just set aside 10-20 euro each week and started to accumulate BTC. My credit card was maxed out, my wife got pregnant, she had some health issues and didn't come back to work until last year. We were struggling, counting every cent. The price of BTC was going down... So every week I could buy more. Bitcoin became my saving account. It was the money I didn't want to touch. I was asking myself many times if I'm doing the right thing buying BTC. Maybe I should put those 10-20 euros into my credit card instead. But I knew how it worked for me. I would use the money from my credit card if I needed them for buying groceries. During the downtrend I started to be fascinated by the technology behind Bitcoin - reading everything about it, and accumulating more bitcoins. I started to sell small bits of my stash in 2017. I paid off my credit card and now I have some nice savings. Life is so much easier. For me the downtrend in 2014 and 2015 was a great opportunity. Who knows, maybe we're facing another downtrend and another great opportunity to accumulate cheap coins. Good luck ;)

I'm running a full node as well, but I don't keep much bitcoins there, because security is lower than on hardware wallets. Why there's no hardware wallets support on Bitcoin Core? Bitcoin Core + HW would be a perfect solution for me.

Hoarders are afraid to spend their precious bitcoins. It's a psychological trap especially if replenishing them is time-consuming (bitcoin value can jump in those 2-3 days when you don't have them in your wallet). The best way to deal with that is to keep some money in the exchange (I just keep 100-200$). When I buy something for bicoins I replenish them immediately. Then I send funds to the exchange to replenish my fiat money.

Last month I was waiting for almost 6 hours for the first confirmation of my transaction. The fee was too low. I was using Bitgo and the fee was set at only 0.0001 BTC for about 12 kB transaction size. I was a little bit nervous because I sent all the bitcoins I had to the new address and was wondering if I see them again :) I contacted their support afterwards and informed them that the fee has been wrongly calculated but the answer was that my transaction was finally confirmed so everything is fine.

I checked his posts history and he was only trolling bitcoin community since early 2011. All his posts ridicule bitcoin. He never bought any bitcoins for 5$. All his posts on praise blockchain and ridicule bitcoin.

I always feel uneasy when price is going up so quickly. Maybe because I bought most of my bitcoins (buying weekly) in 2014 and 2015 during downtrend when I was confident that the trend will reverse after one final panic sell-off. I was waiting for that moment and even bought the dip (in August 2015). I firmly believe in Bitcoin but another downtrend can happen after some big gains - it's normal in economy and happened to Bitcoin many times. Personally i chose to sell some small amount every time price doubles (5-10%). It gives a relief and rewards you for hodling.

Sold everything when the price hit $0.40 ;)

You can buy bitcoins for VEF on localbitcoins.com

Good point, I've just calculated it looking at BTC/VEF price on localbitcoins :) 1 USD is worth around 1000 VEF

Let's see if miners CAN AFFORD to oppose SegWit in the long term. If Bitcoin can't progress, so can't the miners' profits.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:12:28
If transaction isn't urgent people should look at  and choose "hourFee". It would create some downward pressure. Unfortunatelly people tend to stick to the highest fees to make sure their transaction is confirmed in the next block.

My dad 10 days ago: Did you hear that Bitcoin is for 7000$ !? Everybody at my work talking about it!! How many bitcoins you have ??? Me: I have some.. but I don't want ALL people from your work know about it. Dad : I thought you'd be excited about the NEWS !!! ....

Anyway Bitcoin performance shouldn't be dependent on price of other fork coins. Devs should think about changing Bitcoin's archaic difficulty adjustment algorithm.

Sometimes I had problems with passwords when me or my daughter pressed CTRL+SHIFT accidentally. It changes keyboard layout - different keys for special characters - QWERTY changes to QWERTZ etc.. So you set a new password with keyboard layout changed and then again accidentally change it back to normal. You hit the same keys but it's different password

Just install Bitcoin Core on your PC. Free of charge and easy to set up ;) There's a profit by running full node - you don't have to trust SPV clients and with the upcoming fork it might save you a lot of money.

Price will crash. Miners will lose a lot of money. Miners will have to support SegWit in hope of price rise. SegWit gets activated. Core pushes hard fork increasing block size and introducing flex cap. Everybody is happy. Bitcoin rises to 10 000 $

Racism? I talk about facts. I'm not saying Chinese people are inferior to the rest of the world. I admire Chinese people and respect their contribution to the Bitcoin space. They played a big positive role in the past. It's just sad to hear that the miners with support of large part of the community want to hijack the Bitcoin brand for themselves. Bitcoin is international and should stay international.

I don't know about you guys, but nobody can force me to use/buy B2X coin. Bitcoiners are a well educated community and  know what the real Bitcoin is. Chinese want to make original chain unusable after fork and it will end really bad.. for them.

I'm buying bitcoin since April 2014. Just 10 euro per week which is about 3% of my salary. Sometimes I buy for more if I have more money to spend. I don't risk much, so I don't panic when the price is going down. I can buy more bitcoins for my 10 euro. If the price goes down to 10 euro per bitcoin I will buy 1 bitcoin per week :) Bitcoin is perfect long-term store of value. I believe that this technology has a huge potential. There are so many projects, big investments. The trend will reverse sooner or later.

Does it mean "1 vote = 1 transaction" on bitcoin blockchain? 
So with maximum of 7 tx/s = 604800 votes per 24 hours?

I created my Xapo account in February. I sent scans of my id and proof of address and was waiting 2 weeks. I sent email to support but no answer. I forgot about Xapo but 3 months later I finally received an email that my account has been verified. By comparison my account in Coinbase was verified in 2 minutes
