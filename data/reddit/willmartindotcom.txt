It's called Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB).

I'm worried about violating the "community rules" - see right:
"No wallet addresses in posts/comments."

yes I'm the original poster

On one hand bitcoin is valued as a store of wealth like gold. Due to its low supply inflation (ultimately finite supply), bitcoins may become more attractive during a crisis if fiat currencies experience hyperinflation. Unlike gold, bitcoins can be moved across boarders instantly. In a financial crisis where people panic and try to move their wealth out of collapsing economies, bitcoin's value may rise as people try to use it to get around currency controls.
On the other hand bitcoin is valued as a medium of exchange, like dollars. The more transactions are conducted online and the larger percentage of those transactions that are conducted in bitcoin, the higher bitcoin's value goes. In a severe recession, the global volume of bitcoin-denominated online transactions could fall, hurting bitcoin's valuation.

But... technically speaking it's not a "wallet address" - it's a BitxBay decentralized trade address - so the "deal" address on BitxBay is: BM-NBY6Hc4u9CJbqLVcTG76X3a1J5put4vy

My personal view is that this would only happen as the result of an economic collapse. In many places that have seen such collapses (Soviet Union, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Yugoslavia) other currencies have spontaneously taken hold - usually the US Dollar.
There are a lot of reasons we could see an economic collapse in the future: runaway debt, runaway climate change, war, peak oil, etc.
If in the future we see another economic collapse in a society that has a sizable minority of people who are already familiar with bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, they could use the collapse as an opportunity to persuade the rest of society to adopt a cryptocurrency instead of using some other foreign fiat currency.
So as others have said on here, if you provide the technology in a way that makes it easy to use, the likelihood increases that people will embrace it in such a dire situation.

I just looked at the Quora on shaddowbanning - that's a super sketchy practice. There is no way to know that you've been shadowbanned and they don't tell you why. And there is no way to fix it. It's like being found guilty by one of those secret Guantanamo juries!
soooo this is my new account

It costs 0.007 bitcoins - about $4.50

And how many Bitcoin exchanges went bankrupt over the same period? Percentage-wise it's probably higher.

Exactly - with cash or Bitcoin you have two options: hold it yourself or trust a third party to hold it. When banks go bankrupt we have the FDIC to reimburse you. When your Bitcoin exchange goes bankrupt you're out of luck. When you hold cash at home you can be robbed. When you hold bitcoins yourself you can be hacked.
The point the OP was perhaps trying to make is that the entire US dollar system is at risk of collapse. In that case you'd be better off holding bitcoins. Then of course the entire Bitcoin system could also collapse. So maybe the moral of the story is that asset diversification is good.

If only there was some kind of anonymous cryptocurrency out there...
