Nonsense. Those charges all disappeared and he was never *actually* charged.

The corrupt actions of FBI agents involved in the case (who had admin privileges on Silk Road) cast doubt on the veracity of the murder-for-hire charges. Unless, of course, the “personally written notes” you mention were handwritten. There was no forensic investigation proving that it was Ross Ulbricht himself, and not another admin, who wrote any of that (or whether it was falsified completely from scratch). 
The murder-for-hire allegations were raised in court specifically to bias the trial outcome, and this was even very clearly stated by both judge and prosecutor. Sorry, but them’s the facts. He was not charged. There were no bodies. There was no real evidence that would stand up in court.

Yep. And then those charges disappeared and never came back. He was never *actually* charged...

Yep. It was tossed around during the trial to bias the jury (the prosecution even *literally* said that’s what they were doing), but no actual charges were brought or could have been proven. 
In fact, none of the trial could possibly have been proven since corrupt federal agents (later arrested for their *own* crimes related to the Silk Road investigation) had admin level access and could have tampered the evidence to whatever narrative they wanted to portray. In fact, the defense was specifically precluded from even bringing this point up after having made the court aware of the issue. 
The “trial” was bullshit. Utter and complete bullshit, stirred up with a vast public-facing propaganda effort. Kangaroo court at its finest.

Many did, unfortunately. ��

A. Five of these charges were dropped. 
B. The remaining one has never (and will never) be brought. 
C. The “evidence” is highly suspect, as federal agents definitely had the ability and motive to fabricate it. 
D. Again, the murder-for-hire charge was explicitly used *only* to bias the verdict. The evidence for its own validity is tenuous at best, and it, even being the “worst” crime Ross was charged with, was never prosecuted (and, again, never will be). 
Your insistence on bringing it up is inane and seemingly motivated by other reasons from an attempt to reach truth.

What murder-for-hire charges...? Ross was never charged with that. That was an allegation used by the prosecution to color the judgement of the court.

Sorry, but no. 
 
“One of the agents (DEA agent Carl Mark Force) was the lead undercover agent in the case against Ulbricht, and had high-level access to administrative functions of the Silk Road, including the ability to manipulate logs, chats, private messages, posts, account information and bank accounts.
The defense learned of these investigation details only five weeks before trial, but it was sealed pending completion of the investigation – they could not refer to it at trial, nor delay the trial until the investigation was concluded.
These facts literally change everything. They render suspect every piece of government evidence, including the logs alleging Ulbricht ordered hits, including the money transfers, and more.”

Umm... WUT? Bitcoin has a cap of 21,000,000. This is a known quantity, and it cannot be inflated. Increase of available supply is not equal to monetary inflation. 
Furthermore, bitcoin purchasing power has increased significantly. This is called “deflation”.

Uh... Ross didn’t deal any drugs. He ran a website. That is all.

Since when has the IRS cared about strict adherence to written law...? They’ve still never produced the actual law authorizing income taxes (aside for pointing to self referential *regulations*). ��‍♂️

Original quote is from Baron Rothschild, who said: 
“Buy when there’s blood in the streets, even if some of that blood is yours.” 
(Or something to that effect... I’m quoting from memory.)

So.... is Craigslist responsible for whatever people sell in its classified section? Not only are they not, but there are specific laws exempting websites from liability for what their users do. (Look up Section 230 of CDA)

Interestingly, he probably doesn’t consider USD to be a fraud (although he ought to by his criteria). Lol
