What do you believe is contributing to the higher murder rate, then?


Well, it's more like a 5x higher murder rate. And it's more like 'for the freedom to own firearms', rather than general freedom. Do you really believe most Americans are cool with a 5x greater risk of murder just so they can have easier access to a wider range of firearms? 
By the way, Australian citizens are hardly being held hostage by our government. We really aren't sacrificing our 'freedom' for gun control laws. In fact, we [rank higher than you guys]( in terms of the world's freest countries. You come in at number 7.

No. Are you confusing Australia with North Korea? Easy mistake, I'm sure.


Are you trying to rebut my argument by suggesting Australia is manipulating the CDC's website so that I can't access factual statistics?
I can't even deal. Go back to stockpiling jams and AK47s for the apocalypse.

Ignoring the fact that the US has [many]( notable [mass murders]( by [fire]( we'll get down and dirty with the basic figures.
Australia has a homicide rate of 1.0 per 100,000 people. About 17% of these murders are committed by firearm. [Source.](
America has a homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000 people. Nearly 70% of these murders are committed by firearm. [Source](
I'm sure there are many reasons why you are more than 5x more likely to be murdered in America than in Australia, but I refuse to believe that lack of gun legislation isn't a massive contributing factor.

Trying to neuter != asking you to throw 'America' in there so we know what country's legislation you're talking about. Or are you so ashamed of being American that you don't want people to know you're American? That's sad. You shouldn't be ashamed. I think America is grand.
