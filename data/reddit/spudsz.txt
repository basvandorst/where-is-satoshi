Found it using Olly. Definitely malware.

I have blocked this for all Sophos web filtering products (Anti Virus, Web Appliance, UTM). Anyone using Sophos should now be blocked access to this site.

Just doing my part :) Thank you!

Is this it? MD5: c4e99fdcd40bee6eb6ce85167969348d
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:06:40
Ah, I read some more of your posts. I'm gonna give it a try when I get off work. If I can replicate this I will add detection :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:20:41
Great answer :)
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:03:13
Cheers! :)

I disagree. Gaining root is only an exploit away. Once you have root, you have access to the unencrypted private key! Very dangerous. The fact that the Android Bitcoin Wallet does not allow you to encrypt the wallet on the phone (it only encrypts backups) is absurd. I refuse to use Bitcoin Wallet and instead use Blockchain.info with double encryption.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:23:55
Amazing! Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:00:37
Awesome! Thank you! :)
Could you possibly describe how you dumped the script?
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:54:18
I reversed this enough to find the wallet stealing code before writing detection for it on the original thread. 
I was able to find the LiveCode code in memory using OlyDbg.
@_date: 2014-03-21 06:14:33
Yeah at that point we have to write a proper unpacker/decryptor 
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:59:36
Someone posted some photos from the day :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:57:07
Done. OSX variant is now detected as OSX/BitSteal-B by Sophos AV.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:51:50
Done. Windows variant is now detected as Troj/BitSteal-A by Sophos AV.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:13:41
Yeah sweet. I'll give it a go in Olly when I get some spare time.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:39:05
Can I get a SHA1 or MD5 of the sample?
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:12:43
Oh! This style/idea needs to be combined with the Magic Internet Money Wizard!
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:51:15
This is exactly what I'm trying to avoid :)
I'm going to be in London on Saturday. A little bit earlier than the February launch of these ATMs. If only they were up and running now :)
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:20:58
I bought all the Monstercat albums with Bitcoin during the cyber Monday sales :)
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:20:11
You would have had a million encrypted backups in your email by DEFAULT.

"OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembler level analysing debugger" 
TibaneBackOffice.exe was an executable found in the leaked MtGox package. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:18:31
Yeah I work for SophosLabs. I can push out a detection for anyone using the Sophos AntiVirus engine. Do you also have a Mac sample? I can see in the script dump the OSX stuff, but a compiled Mac sample would be nice from a detection point of view. Our Mac product is free :) Yeah I've lurked around before, but not a whole lot.

Glad to see more and more people accepting Bitcoin in Australia :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:16:40
Ryan, I love CoinJar and I have bought 99% of my Bitcoin with it :)
This is an awesome development in the Bitcoin world! 
Keep up the awesome work :)
Come up to Sydney sometime so we can have some 
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:28:52
I met a guy in his late 60s who decided to come to a Bitcoin meet-up this week to get more info.
He had a whole page printed out of his own notes he had made about what Bitcoin is and where he could get a wallet.
I sat with him and explained how he can go about creating and securing his wallet, and then how/where he could purchase his first Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:50:14
New form of Bitcoin mining :) Nice

Agreed, I've been using Synergy for years now. It's been amazing :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:15:59
Here's one I compiled earlier :) 
@_date: 2013-11-12 10:08:32
Keep up the awesome work :)
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:13:27
Nice work guys :) love your work
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:10:26
I'm from Aus, but I'll be in Exeter at the end of January. Keep us posted so I can come along and trade some Bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:11:26
If you're handy with a C# compiler, check this out: 
I was playing with it recently, and you can can do a wide variety of stuff with generating and encrypting your custom private key.
Also, the fact that you have to compile it means you know it's doing what you want it to do ;)
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:02:34
I always enjoy reading these kind of stories :) Awesome stuff :) Thanks for sharing

I'm still waiting for my Butt Fuck Labs Anal Rape Cube :(
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:24:20
I just received this in my email inbox. Sent from bfl_news
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:56:19
These are not the coins you're looking for. Move along
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:37:21
Yeah, I'm still waiting for my J̶a̶l̶a̶p̶e̶n̶o̶ Anal Rape Cube.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:35:23
Butt Fuck Labs?

I have the most secure 1.8 BTC money can buy. Encrypted wallet from a year ago. I don't remember the password! 
I know that feel
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:28:27
Just bought one :) Payed with Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:19:43
This is how we do it in Australia :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:20:36
hahaha! MOON!
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:34:31
I already access it from my mobile browser but I'm sure it's just the desktop version. It doesn't present me with a specific mobile version.
That being said, it's very well made, so it scales and ports very nicely, even on a mobile device :) &lt;3
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:10:56
Yay! :)
Even a nice mobile friendly web interface would do for the time being? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:56:09
Holy shit this is awesome! I love Monstercat! 
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:24:28
Yeah seriously. I use CoinJar like crazy.
@_date: 2013-11-12 10:13:16
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:28:34
Haha spam folder! That's where it belongs!
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:41:37
Hahaha nice try ButtFuck Labs!
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:15:30
This is awesome :)

Careful mate, Dad's Private Key is faint but half visible in that photo ;)
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:21:02
Paper wallet, preferably encrypted with BIP38 :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:34:19
I listen to your podcast every week :)
I've just purchased all the albums with Bitcoin :)
Could you guys please consider accepting Bitcoin for merchandise? I would love to buy a tshirt :)
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:23:52
Nice work mate :) Keep up the good work
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:59:09
Yeah mate, CoinJar is amazing
