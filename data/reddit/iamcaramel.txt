Use bitstamp or another website. MTGOX seems a bit too complicated for me.

Registering to see a chart? No way I'm doing that.

You could wait for the weekend. It might go down a bit friday to sunday. Make sure you have money deposited in your account and buy then.

There is no way to buy bitcoins with a credit/debit card, PayPal or other online payment platform. If a website says they will sell with one of these methods don't trust them. At least not for now.
Bitcoins can only be purchased by sending the money to an exchange website with Western Union, bank transfer etc. It's a more lengthy process but it's because the exchange website needs to make sure you will not request your money back once you have the bitcoins.
After you send them the money and buy the bitcoins you can do anything you want with them: store them on their website, put them in your own wallet, buy drugs, throw a clown party etc.
My personal preference is bitstamp.net for purchasing bitcoins.

MtGox has an obscenely long waiting list and you need to upload a form of ID to get verified.
I use bitstamp. No validation and it takes about 3 days for your transfer to be added to the site.
Make sure you activate the two step authentication.
Bare in mind I haven't used any other websites for my transactions but I'm pretty satisfied with bitstamp.
