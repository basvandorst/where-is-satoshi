You can get fractions of bitcoins, you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin in the same way you can buy one gram of gold and you don't have to buy a tonne of it.

In fact, it has already happened in certain way.
Some altcoins have used proof of burn (basically destroy bitcoins) to distribute its coins and it is also known that large sums of bitcoins have been lost in the past (hard drives broken, lost private keys...) and  none of this had a significant effect.
