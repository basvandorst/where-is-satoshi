Hi, If you have forgotten your PIN but haven't updated the Trezor, then yes. I can help you. BR, Zero404Cool

That makes sense, excellent. But please don't blame me for your own typo. And why make private discussion public?

Some people say that the Earth is flat, some people say that CC EAL6+ &amp; FIPS 140-2 Level 4 always just represent "security by obscurity". Different people, different viewpoints.
I am still not going to use a hardware wallet that always keeps my private keys in SRAM without any reason whatsoever and refuses to even acknowledge the problem. Why not fix it?
Four months ago, told me that Trezor is absolutely safe and there is no way to help someone who has lost their PIN &amp; seed words.
Apparently, there is a good possibility that these people can finally get their Bitcoins back now. @_date: 2017-08-19 01:43:34
Where exactly did you say that you are working on these issues? I must have missed it. Please provide a link...

I am not ignoring passphrase at all. I will write about passphrase security next week. I like how Trezor has built open source wallet for the community. I also like that Keepkey has made some good security modifications. But this doesn't mean that the work is done and you can't do any better.

Nothing personal, just referencing relevant people.
But you do notice how everything was called "scam" &amp; "FUD" four months ago too, while in fact all I said was true.
Also, sorry that Trezor was the first in the queue and the easiest to hack, Ledger is waiting.
Btw, am I even allowed to post on ?

you are writing that:
"...MCU has disabled JTAG, so there is no need to block access to MCU pins"
"...rather than relying on chance that hardware vendor did the good job" "we introduce smart logical concepts which are unbreakable"
Who disabled the JTAG? The **hardware vendor** is responsible for that functionality. 
So in reality, you are definitely **relying on the chance** that hardware vendor did the good job!
Now ask yourself, how many hardware wallets are using STMicro chips? For how long time already?
How easy would it be for a government to put backdoor into these chips provided just by **a single vendor**?

The method of dumping RAM without opening hardware is described here: 
Trezor hotfix 1.5.2 still has the following issues:
* 1) reset_handler fix (filling memory) is **not executed** when you run "Frozen Trezor" attack.
* 2) bootloader reset_handler fix only affects new Trezors, it doesn't do anything for the majority of existing ones.
* 3) Private keys &amp; PIN are still kept in SRAM, they are still kept in unnecessarily expanded format. **Why risk it?**

So I am dick when you make a typo? Don't you think that other people would also like to know if you are working on a solution or not? that fixes something you also call **"the issue"**? anyway, my inbox is not a good place for these announcements.

Have you even tried to freeze Trezor device &amp; run it at low temperatures? We all know the answer, **you haven't!**  
How can you claim that version 1.5.2 fixes everything without even testing it?  
Data remanence together with glitching introduces all sorts of interesting behaviors.  
You can't just expect the hardware to do what you think it will do &amp; what it is supposed to do.  
It is extremely tricky to fix hardware that doesn't have any chip level anti-tamper protections. 
How can you call it fixed while you are **still keeping plain text seed words and PIN in the SRAM** at all times?  
Why do you even need to extract these seed words into SRAM **before** asking for the PIN code?   
Yesterday you claimed that:
* this advanced attack doesn't even exist
* there is no connection to DEFCON25 &amp; glitching
* it can't be done in 15 seconds
* it can't be done by connecting to wires/pins 
Today we know that you were wrong about all of these. What about tomorrow?

You can recover your Bitcoins like this:

No, it doesn't have anything like that. It is based on a stm32f427 Cortex-M4 microcontroller. That is not a security/crypto chip.
