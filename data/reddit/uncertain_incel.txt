I thought you were already asked to stop with the triple spacing shit.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:08:57
Young child, there are these things called banks.  There is this new thing (bitcoin) that threatens to destroy their business model.  They know this and are fucking with the market to make people opt-out.
Quite honestly, every time I see a post from you, I downvote immediately.  You are fucking annoying.
@_date: 2018-09-02 12:35:02
It's basically stealing from others.
The difference is that is is now visible to the world and will be stopped.

Summary for from 2013:
@_date: 2018-09-02 04:49:35
Needs more triple-space.  You were already asked to stop that.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:11:41
Fucking blow me.  I am correct.  Downvote away.
I've dealt with this under various accounts since 2013.
I have since to be proven wrong by you half-wits who are here to be rich.  It's never going to happen.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:29:37
OK. dude.
If you met me you would have a different tone.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:46:39
Go away.
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:39:09
Ummmm.  Can you see the future?  October 2018 is still a bit away.
@_date: 2018-08-24 04:58:40
You seriously need to look at your life. 
Nobody here wants to see this shit.
@_date: 2018-08-28 04:59:21
Oh fuck off.
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:07:04
Nazi Troll, you have caught a glimpse of stupid in the wild.  Ignore and move on.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:30:56
This has only been posted 10 fucking times already.
Fuck your stupid site.
@_date: 2018-08-25 04:58:59
So, we have some tool with a modeling photo breaking news that nobody in the world knows..?
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:27:18
The guy with the name "CRYPTOTECHADVISE" is asking what the fuck is happening...
What a fucking genius.
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:53:30
I'm pretty fucking sure you and Klancepaul are the same person.  
You are equally annoying and shit is posted from both accounts around the same time.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:30:53
You must be functionally retarded.  You cannot even post on Reddit properly.  Just go away.
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:29:45
I was down nearly 15k USD through 2014 &amp; 2015 after my initial purchases in 2013.  I kept buying through 2014-2017 &amp; early 2018 while people, including family, were attempting to dissuade me.
It was nerve wracking at times but I still believe Bitcoin will become the global payment network of the world within 5 years.
People who got in at ~20k USD are now dealing with what I've (and many others) already dealt with.
@_date: 2018-08-23 08:16:18
My assumption is you had no idea what you were doing and lost money thinking you were going to get rich quick.
That is not how this works or what this is.
Move on.
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:37:47
This isn't Twitter, idiot.
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:18:56
Stop trying to make your stupid sites happen.  They aren't going to happen.
This shit has been posted at least a dozen times today.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:07:19
How is that not possible?  There are ~36 million millionaires globally.  I'd wager most of them have at least 200k+ in cash on hand...
1 million per BTC is nothing.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:29:45
Dude, go away.  You are one annoying motherfucker.  This is your 7th account this week.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:28:21
Dude, for the third time, fuck your stupid coinness site.
@_date: 2018-08-24 04:51:14
Yay another nobody making a new site with a stupid name.
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:00:54
How does one meet a website?  You are a fool pumping your stupid site.
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:41:16
Dude, seriously, fuck off with your stupid site.
You don't even post links to your stories.  You have no idea how the internet works.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:44:39
Fuck your stupid site.  Stop trying to make it happen.  It's not going to happen.
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:40:15
How much money is in your bank account?
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:40:02
Translation: 
Hi everyone.  I'm trying to get you to go to my "awesome" new site - help me.
Fuck off!
My assumption is this is a scheme to collect IP addresses to target.
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:51:12
Stop posting your stupid fucking site.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:46:13
Do you not see all the downvotes?  You are fucking annoying, dude.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:52:51

@_date: 2018-08-23 06:17:50
Aren't you the genius who has gone through 5-6 different accounts in the past 6 days or so?
Why not just go away at this point?
@_date: 2018-08-23 08:30:09
Username is dumb as is the domain.
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:24:20
I have an internet connection and have heard of bitcoin...  Lemmee make a site:
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:53:14
BREAKING!!!!!!!!!!!!  This has already been posted repeatedly.  I'm not visiting your stupid site.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:50:09
So, a relative handful of idiots control bitcoin?
Fuck these exchanges.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:57:13
Who comes up with these stupid fucking domain names?
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:21:02
Maybe post this again an hour from now because it hasn't already been posted 12+ times.
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:17:33
Dude, stop posting your stupid videos here.  In case you haven't figured it out yet, nobody wants to see them.
