in 5 years there will be no bitcoin community. there will just be bitcoin and everyone will use it. calling yourself part of the bitcoin community will be like calling yourself part of the dollar community because you spend dollars. you'll be a total dork for saying such a thing.

Already there :) I regularly get groceries at Target using Gyft paid for with bitcoin. For a while there Walmart was an option too (via eGifter) but they have since stopped accepting all gift cards issued by 3rd party.

@_date: 2014-07-26 12:48:36
nope. first of all many people will never sell their bitcoins. but imagine if they tried to buy all the bitcoins. as they start to buy them all up, the supply drops, which means demand rises.. along with the price, and more people start hodling.
and, theoretically speaking, even if there was only 1 bitcoin left ... it could be worth many trillions and everyone in the world could share it

You do realize that the value would have gone down even if they gave them to you right away, right? Unless you had planned to spend them immediately.
So.. you'd rather be holding them to enjoy they drop more viscerally? I guess I can dig that.

@_date: 2014-09-14 19:47:03
Yes, well whether that may or may not have happened is all well and good .. but why not just say .. "they seized his bitcoins." That statement makes sense .. and it makes sense for whatever their scenario was. Calling a bitcoin "physical" .. for any reason .. is ambiguous at best. It demands clarification.. I guess that's just a pet peeve of mine. A news story is supposed to shed light on events .. not obfuscate them.

I accept bitcoin directly.
Here I can prove it.. send some here:
@_date: 2014-09-15 09:14:24
Exactly.. none of your explanation exists in the write up. It's confusing and requires you to formulate your own understanding, as you've done. It's terrible journalism. You don't know what it means either, you're guessing ... and your guess is as good as mine. If only the person who wrote it knew what they were talking about... and if they did, then we might.
@_date: 2014-08-10 18:11:50
Bitcoin doesn't need your support. **You** need **bitcoin**'s support.
Eventually you will come to understand this as the absolute truth.
