No, but I think these guys contacted me the other day to share efforts. Their aim was to make positive PR for bitcoins. I told them honestly that what we're doing is not an official charity organization but a group of volunteers, and therefore we're not well-suited for what they wanted to achieve, so they started looking for the official charity organizations to fund. On the spot we deal with different scales of requests here: NGOs organize and fund expensive medical treatment abroad, etc. while we deliver necessary stuff to very exact divisions and groups of protesters and patients, avoiding big organizations and big places of food/medicine storage, because there's more risk that those in need won't get what is necessary.

emmm. no. that's a matter of principle. treatment, food, clothing, hosting, protection and communication necessities. nothing that can harm other people.

that is why we mostly pay with card for what we buy, cash became a deficit

there's a hope to get one. not right now, not even tomorrow. but they say people get the kind of government which they deserve. right now I see people there standing for 3 months **deserving** a better government.

I don't approve of all the people who are involved, I am sure there are inadequate individuals on protesters' side as well as good guys on the other side.
I also respect everyone's right to make their own choices. But consider another thing also: Maidan was peaceful and would remain like that if the Government would provide a necessary dialogue with people. They ignored millions of protesters and have beaten peaceful students on Maidan. Now Putin is ready to send military forces to "protect Russian population of Crimea" which is not endangered by anyone. The only Russian killed in the conflict was a journalist shot by pro-Yanukovich riot police. So it's a much tougher question than might seem: who's on the war's side here?

I can't force you to believe me. But keep in mind, that Yanoukovich was elected as a president because Yushchenko didn't cope and there was no alternative. But he was elected in 2010 as a president of parliament-presidential state. Afterwards he and his fellas passed an unconstitutional law changing Ukraine into a president-parliamentary state, he basically gave himself more power, and during the past years became a criminal boss instead of a country's leader. His rule has nothing to do with democracy and is the best that happened to this country since independence proclamation.
