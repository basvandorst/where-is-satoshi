I would go with a cash deposit, then once BTC in your wallet, use a tumbler service

I dont think buying coins at market price and then selling them at gox coins low price would get them very  far.

I would put in $100 in BTC or how ever much you can spare.  Who is to say what $100 in BTC will be worth in 4 years.  Might have a nice $$$ gift waiting when you graduate.

Shit happens, and shit happens to btc way more frequently than any othe forum of currency or investment.

Its not a problem with his memory or effort, its due to a security hole in the brain protocol.
