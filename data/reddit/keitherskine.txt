FWIW - Bitfinex is sending their Tether transactions at 300 sat/B. They must really want them transacted on the next block.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:30:16
It's not old news when we, the market, are just finding out about it today.

v. the counterfeiters at Tether which is printing 'money' out of whole cloth and desperately trying the pump up the BTC price.

This is so awesome. MAPS is doing some ground breaking work and this donation will help in finding treatments and possibly cures for many diseases of the brain!!!

This is a great data point. I think it reinforces the need for simple and fast POS solutions for merchants

Or - in addition to the bitcoin remittance, you ship an inexpensive Android phone with a wallet app loaded but not activated. I'm not sure what the mobile infrastructure is like in Venezuela but it would be a start. It might take 10-20,000 phones to kick off, but it's doable.

I don't think you're paranoid. You're (and I mean you, me, and a whole lot of other people watching the ticker) are just processing a lot of information that will eventually be reflected in the Bitcoin price. This is a new asset that's been created in an age of instant information (or disinformation) flow. We're all still trying to figure out how to use it. 
My guess is that we're transitioning for using Bitcoin as a store of value (like Gold) to one where it's used a currency. I'd expect more volatility until a bunch of smart people figure out this next phase.

If you make money transacting Bitcoin to local currency then yes, lots of transactions are great.

That's a feature, not a bug

Thompson is right about the last mile. My current thinking is that Bitcoins advantage will only be possible when the 
* Trust from the average user increases
* Transaction is done OUTSIDE of regulatory compliance
* Person giving cash out at Point B still makes a profit

Well - I can assume that they have people managing the "risk", but they're not the people writing the prospectus. At some point in First Data's roadshow they're going to asked about Bitcoin and they're going to have to come up with an answer - is it a risk to their business or an opportunity.
As to the abduction by aliens, I can only assume it'll be addressed in an amended S1 =)
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:01:34
S1 us written by the company with help from outside counsel/consultants. The SEC is also involved in the final draft process. In this case Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. L.P. (KKR) probably had input as well. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 01:16:41
Not exactly - mostly law firms are consulting. The S1 is the responsibility of company management. It's there neck on the line if they write BS (more so with Sarbanes/Oxley)

It was under the "Substantial and increasing..." header.
You might be right. Maybe it won't amount to anything in Paypal's business. But, I'm going to take the other side of that bet. 
If I'm wrong - I'll be the guy standing on the corner with a cardboard sign with hand drawn QR code of my bitcoin address.

Tony - lots of information to present. I'd leave a cookbook (information you presented in checklist format) behind that people can follow with step-by-step instructions. Good luck and expect tech support calls (business opportunity =)
@_date: 2015-07-22 01:17:22
How about you and me read the amended S1s that will be released in the near future and find out.
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:18:49
You're right regarding consumer protection and that feature will continue to be valuable. 
But, for small purchases (price of two pizzas for example), chargeback is less important. The Point of Sale business is 60% of their revenue, and I believe having an alternative payment system (Bitcoin) without the higher fees will be a big impact on it.

Thanks for the edit - I sometimes type too fast for my own good.

No need - I imagine they'll questioned during the road show with underwriters
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:08:26
I subscribe to both forums and can say the feeling is mutual based on the postings, just change some names around. Reddit loves this because angst and vitriol drives more advertising.

@_date: 2015-07-21 20:03:47
As they meet underwriters they'll probably file amended S1s based on input and questions.

Good start - I'd change the message a bit: focus on the ability to send money to relatives inside Greece. 
Another ad would be to focus on shop owners; ~~except~~ accept Bitcoin for the time being instead of cash
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:57:40
Adam - there's almost US$70 billion on the line, and you're writing on plaintiff screed asking the miners (the businesses that extend the blockchain) to "please don't fork"? And you're doing it on Reddit? 
Have you made any phone calls? Do you even know any of these people? Have you put in the investment of your time to get a business relationship with them??

If you add some convincing fake news ("China is banning Bitcoin") and a spam attack to drive up the transactions in the Mempool, I'm guessing you could drive the price down more than 10%.
