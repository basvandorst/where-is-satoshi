“Our bitcoin energy audit model assumes that miners will spend half the value of a potential million-dollar Bitcoin on electricity to mine such a Bitcoin...."
They assume bitcoin is on course for $1million / coin value.

Stocks, a loaf of bread, illegal drugs; you gotta pay for it.

Looks more like a commercial for bitcoin.de to me.

If you click on the "learn more" link a list appears:
Coin - 1 Ounce +฿2.6783
Coin - 1/2 Ounce +฿1.2091
The current spot for silver/usd/btc would be ~฿2.679/oz.
There is a bit of a premium on ASE's but if the list of truly their offering price, it doesn't seem that bad to me. Give them a call and see what they will offer for your 90% (not on the list). Myself or others at [might be able to get you a better deal.

No, it is recommended that you use a different receive address for each person to keep track of who paid you and for anonymity. Lets say you receive coins from someone and you don't want them to know you you are. If you have received coins from that same address by other people, they could reveal your identity if they know it.

Using which service/wallet?

What do you plan on doing with the coins? I've seen plenty of bitcoin projects merely inserting themselves in between a user and an existing business and then converting the accepted coins to cash to pay the business. I don't see how this helps bitcoin besides making the exchanges more active.
