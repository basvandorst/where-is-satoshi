The purpose of bitcoin is to become a full blown currency. The intended structure was to gain user support and security, via long term market adjustment. Notably companies are just now beginning to utilize this coin. This is the beginning of the crypto rage; It was never intended to be a "fast" market. 
When companies like overstock hopped on board it signified a new age to its flexibility. This will eventually lead to more online markets to begin accepting it. From small time suppliers like geeks.com to their ultimate rivals such as amazon.com. 
The recent establishment of atm's and debit cards prove a valuable source to BTC holders in their security. The longer these show growth, the more companies will catch on. (hence slow growth). 
BTC is a valued commodity by its users, And we should very well view it as an investment; however companies that want funds see it as a vehicle to drive sales. 
What started out as a digital code, is now making its way into the direct transferring of goods. Goods out = sales in. So now when nations like india latch on. These users can get hygiene products, toilet paper, Books, Educational materials, etc (all available on overstock.com by example. 
Not only that but as their own currencies topple, to record lows the BTC provides them a security in comparison to the USD. So instead of investing in their own platforms; They have the protection of a green back, euro, and various other currency exchanges. 
We the community drive the providers of goods to latch onto its flexibility. The more investment companies, atm's and banks that latch on (vendors should I say), The greater our coins grow as a usable utility. So to have even a single bitcoin now. Which was designed to be chopped into smaller and smaller rates. The more the price of a full coin will be worth in the long run. 
The secret is that there is a secret... There will never be more then 21 million coins... HOWEVER if you google Satoshi you get this interesting result: 
A Satoshi is the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin that can currently be sent: 0.00000001 BTC, that is, a hundredth of a millionth BTC. In the future, however, the protocol may be updated to allow further subdivisions, should they be needed.Aug 30, 2011
As anyone can see they always intended smaller decimal brackets. 
Thus the Satoshi'n May be next. This will lead to a 10 x split. 
So as coins reach 10,000 per coin. The split will make them 100,000.00 usd fractually over night. That will cause the next decimal split to do this again. Next split (and so on). 
People are being mislead with the chatter of "more coins". That will be and never was the intent of BTC. It's a diversion. 
Now that the halvening has taken place. People are virtually losing their ability to get in and have a single coin. Once a full sell out takes place. Say good bye to 10,000 prices and hello to near million dollar holdings. (per coin). 
That's my take on it anyways :)

I have changetip and or you can pm me if you care to help. 
this isn't for everyone But it is my guess that one of you can help me get my first coin. 
I promise in the long run I will pay you back todays market price. 
Again this is a time vs cost issue - 
At this time I lost my house, after my girlfriend died in February this year. 
I couldn't afford my place that we just put money into (alot) which was a huge loss. 
I found this community as a new way to get my life back on track but I am slightly striking out on the getting ahead, 
I will update you all when I find out if I can accept bitcoin for my book. its just a long road; I am tired and feel abused, and I just need something to look forward too. 
So even if you just want to toss a few bits towards the gesture. Ty 
I really really am thankful for the opprutunity, and support and everyone that pm's me (from this sub) can have a free copy of my book today- Just pm me your web address. 
Its not that I have nothing to give, its just that my card house was kicked over and ya. Square one never felt so alone :(
Love you guys and thanks for reading if you did. 
Just a sad dude with a sad story, that is running outta time  -
Seriously pm me an email address and free book for you .
It is all I have left to give :(

Ok. 
To be clear -
On electrum, There is a page node for "Receive" with a code: 1G*EeHj**FkaoD7****TdC*TYE*KKb*DAz
This code (blanked out for obvious reasons), is called a "Seed" (?) Y, n?
The seed is a unique id so someone with it can take your shit...?
How Do I receive money if my code is also an avenue for attack? I.e. My address is X...
Now user robs said address?
Am I reading this wrong? (Note saved 12 word code via archive, Good there). Just confused I think on Seed info permissions.
@_date: 2016-11-05 23:16:35
I just am starting out... I have electrum now, with my 3k bits haha. 
Is there anything I need to know about the receiving code? Will this allow others to take money without my permissions? )Like should I keep that secret?
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:00:29
~~wait electrome isnt a wallet?~~ (Ok Electrome is my wallet). 
So what is circle, and coinbase?
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:50:04
Here is to wishing you and our candidate success!
I just started bitcoin and changetip this week! 3000bits so far! But I am happily accepting donations to help lead me to my first whole coin!!!
 Love you guys and all you do!

Hey all. 
This is a browser that pays you advertising revenue, as well as paying you commission for users / affiliates, and you also have the option of purchasing key words! 
When you purchase a key word, you begin to collect revenue for each and every independent web search performed by the users! 
It is a really unique platform and I just wanted to introduce it to the community- :)
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:33:36
Thanks I will check it out asap. 
I seem to have lost 2000 bits through a changetip withdrawal ? 
I am learning :/ any clue if faucetgames is an actual scam? or is this legit?
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:35:44
I didn't want to self promote. 
[There is a link to a demo video of it here:] ( It captures alot of visual aspects of the journey and philosophy to it all, but it lacks all "Literally" all of the charachter introductions, and visual demonstrations of them and their story. 
(It is all I could do with stationary video clips). (I am poor). 
 I just want to sell it on bitcoin if its a possibility
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:03:28
I am actually skinny :(
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:09:58
Nothing hurts :)
Were all waiting on amazon to jump in.(in my own opinion) So they would be a good target...
Amazon = Full market support; They will sign They are simply waiting for it; But they will. 
The reason bitcoin will be a true success is completely related to india. Factually you could buy and sell to them direct; But To me; I like to hold. I have shit; But Its my shit and I am keeping it; Until the price hits +10,000
It will. Just takes time. ;)

YOU ARE THE REAL MVP. I AM DEDICATING MY NEW BITCOIN LIFE TO THIS MOMENT!!!
@_date: 2016-11-05 00:00:23
Like If you never did this. How would you go about getting a wallet, and Actually building / digging (Without costing yourself a penny) to start? Then where do you sell?
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:09:01
I actually have just completed this and am excitedly reading more on this whole subject! This is uncomfortably easy actually. Is there a charge to transfer from electrum to (physical usd / greenback)?
Is that what  Coinbase and circle are (vendors)?
Also: Meant uncomfortable as in "They don't Id or ask an address"? sheesh

The second pic was before my girlfriend died - and i lost my house...
Before I sold my car and moved onto my parents couch...
I also didn't delete it - ?
eitherway I am having a rough day today - so I apologize. 
I really do and I am hopping offline. I know you mean well so I apologize. I just want my life back-
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:00:57
I received my first 1000 bits! This is exciting so far!
@_date: 2016-11-09 08:36:03
Take more then one opinion and then make your own-yea
I am actually just now investing because I have read that prices are expected to rise to 1200 next year. 
(I believe that to be factual), 
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:35:10
I am just now learning how to be a more financially secure...
How does bit coins go up in price? Like if I have 1000 bits today is that more bits tomorrow based on the price? Is a bit a percentage of money? 
If I get more people to invest in bitcoin, Is my bits worth more?
I don't get how sometimes a coin is say 700USD yet it was 1000USD 1 year ago. (Is this a bad or good long term investment, and does it split?
@_date: 2016-11-05 01:03:06
@ How do I collect. Also Update I just downloaded electrum. Is that how I collect? I am attempting to have bits (That I think you left me)? Really confusing...
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:10:08
Thanks - Btc_Forever sent me this, and I am researching it. 
Still trying to figure out how to sell my book. But it may be too complex because I have to pay usd (which I dont have) to ship the book to the users, then accept bitcoin. 
I can't wait until amazon uses BTC... Anyclue if there is a potential they will sign on in the future?
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:31:34
Actually I just wanted to see if it was possible to sell on bitcoin and if there was an avenue already established making this easy for authors...
I feel as an entrepreneur selling amazon goods for bitcoin would be a useful endeavor; (Accepting bit, and dropshipping inventory). (Until amazon hops on board) (If they aren't already). 
This would likely encourage them too in hindsight. 
I just figured the more products that sign up for bitcoin; The more successful bitcoin is as a tool to us all, and the more likely it is to inflate. (As the author I likely have to bulk up the cost to make this happen). So is this an ad... If I was trying to sell the book right now and included the title; Then ya, But No it is quite the opposite :(

I am totally learning everything I can!
I respect your help fare user, and this is very excellent to take in...
I was really interested in the gaming for coins, and or faucets? But ya, mining everyone appears to say is obsolete. 
I lost basically everything and am starting over again, so I wanted to try some new things like investing, and stocks. Just sort of getting my toes wet so to speak...
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:54:07
Thanks. 
I am more worried that they are Phishing sites. Not being paid free credits is nominal compared to stealing outright. 
I will check out pricedice. 
Basically like any new miner? I am hoping to start saving bits now. 
This will be a long term investment strategy, so I wanted to get advice on the do's and don'ts :)
Awesome links though and TY!!!
@_date: 2016-11-05 04:11:38
I just came around "full circle" (Pun haha shoot me). 
No, I really was that retarded for a second there; I am getting it now...
@_date: 2016-11-05 23:18:31
I was upto almost 0001 too but went full tilt lol. 
It is a fun engine, and I am learning its algorithm now. 
Mostly if you max bet you will go full tilt, so always compensate for your losses is what I have observed thus far. (Make small steps) by losing small, and being risky every so often :) Much like a virtual slot machine :)
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:36:48
I am forever thankful for this list :)
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:39:25
To be more specific, I am trying to sell a book yes. 
But I want to sell the book on the bitcoin website; I think this is a helpful way of producing positive PR for BITCOIN. While providing users with yet another product and service that they can engage in with their currency. 
I thought that there may already be a service, but I wasn't sure if there was. I just started doing this like 2 days ago- 
So ya. Just hoping to get a new product on the bit market with others help :)
@_date: 2016-11-05 01:03:54
So what is a wallet? And do I need one or is that basically covered with Coinbase and circle?
@_date: 2016-11-05 23:03:19
I am using Primedice now. 
It offers withdrawal, and deposit. But Deposits are not accepted in my country...
Does withdrawal mean = From primedice and into my bit wallet?
@_date: 2016-11-05 01:05:51
I am trying out electrum now. :)
Ok so I downloaded electrum. Step one complete! 
Now what?
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:14:05
I am not sure of two things. One Team HRC obviously didn't get the memo and the guy running the election committe actually bailed on info wars, yet were supposed to actually think the rigged msm polls were legit when say 80% of americans, and internationals hate the bitch with the passion of hell. 
Meanwhile everyone is saying this is a wager for trump when it would stand obvious to reason that trump winning costs op money. So technically it is incentive for hillary to win; Not trump. 
Thirdly there is no incentive because this isnt a determination of the outcome. The pollers would have to argue this rationally changed their voting; Which it is indignent to a pro trump audience and is nothing more then social cheering-
This isn't influential because he isn't asking you to reconsider. It would be different then actually arguing you to change your vote, and or if it was in R/all. 
But reddit is on the internet. So this isn't in america; This isn't a "Public" forum, and this mans generosity to fellow supporters would have a hard time being rationally argued as persuassive being he is in a FOREIGN FAN FORUM FOR PRO ACTIVISTS. 
I think invading his right to free speech is a more influencial crime then charging him for being proactive in sharing positive influence on his "FELLOW SUPPORTERS". 
I just wanted to point out this is pro hillary propaganda in the circumstances. Don't confuse that-
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:02:41
So I am in on this little comment pool. I just started bitcoin two days ago. Is 0.01btc 1000bits by conversion. I have 3000 bits. I have some idea what that is But I am trying to understand conversion rates...
@_date: 2016-11-16 07:45:57
Thanks farinspace. 
I was thinking about maybe hopping in and out of a few alt coins, but I do agree their futures are limited. 
I know a couple will at least fluctuate (menial profits). 
I just didn't know if they were worth even dabbling in, but I will likely stay away by your advice, and I am certainly going to be a new member on that podcast! Thanks again!!!
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:48:41
It's somewhat complex because create space does the sales via amazon. I have to figure out how to order back-stock to launch the concept) being I don't possess additional copies.  (print on demand).
I can place them for sale on overstock once I can sell enough to actually profit enough to have enough to start - Sigh
Then createspace holds funds for near 90 days -
Idk I am still not really mentally ready yet for work. 
I mean that Like I am not - I am in the socially awkward phase where I get put off and feel distant in a crowded room. If you send me an email happy to send you a copy of the book. But ya - Hopping offline for now - just need to rethink my life a while :(
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:55:50
thanks nimble 
I am going to rethink this and I am blessed to have you being you were the first to contribute to this thing I am not finding much success in. (I still have your bits if you want them back) never spent one-
Honestly this is probably an issue I need time with and I am going to try to clear my pallet today - sorry guys - not myself right now :(
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:13:27
Do you know if any of the alts are even worth putting anything in?
Showing potential for a future market value?

Believe me when I say that I have tried so hard to succeed this year that I am basically just hoping for anything at this point; So rationally it just didn't seem like it would hurt to ask - 
I am thankful for the comment 
I am hopping off line actually - 
Idk just not my day

I am just learning bitcoin. If there are links you guys think I should add, or sections I am entirely missing; Or even blatant bad links known non payers Please lemme know what you know. 
I will continue to scrape together what I gots and try to really make the content lively and forward minded - 
As a newb here I had a hard time finding mass directories, so I started hacking away. 
Neways it still has mass errors. Just hoping you guys book mark it, and find it usefull :)
