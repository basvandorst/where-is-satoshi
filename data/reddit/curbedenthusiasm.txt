Very unlikely it will ever be a million per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:58:15
This is my greatest concern for Bitcoin, no one really seems to be leading the ship. It's hard to find info on a roadmap or any plans. Very concerning. Makes me nervous to be in it at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:16:47
100K is realistic. 1mil completely unrealistic. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:54:31
You might be waiting a long time for order fulfilment.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:45:29
Well, when I said no fee, I really meant minimum fees, like a small token amount, eg 5-10 cents per transaction. Not whole dollar amounts like $10...that seems like the beginning of the end.
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:38:24
That's pretty impressive, then. I still think it will take a long time, if at all, to filter through and be for mainstream purchasing. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:22:34
Pretty sure they did in Guardians of the Galaxy.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:01:36
Did you think I was being serious there? Cute!
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:44:26


nothing is unkillable.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:16:32
Upvoted! haha
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:19:30
How do you only use crypto to buy a car, house, a fridge? The reality is, crypto is fringe until these things occur (which may never happen).
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:31:39
Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:24:10
Along with a dozen other altcoins :/ No one knows.
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:23:43
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:49:02
People who are invested heavily in bitcoin are lashing out because they're scared. This is the beginning of the end.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:14:47
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:37:03
From a dealership?
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:51:33
I recently paid around $4 to send $50 and thought to myself if bitcoin keeps going down this path, it'll be dead in 12 months. The whole point of bitcoin was sending money without fees.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:57:11
Agreed (apart from the fees - they need to start coming down)
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:52:14
Nailed the point exactly. It's a real shame. Our focus should be adoption and Bitcoin becoming the new world currency.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:20:40
Don't forget the risk involved. In hindsight, risk is easily removed.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:43:08
"once in a lifetime" is how I'd expect a dodgy finance guy selling a pyramid scheme to talk.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:27:56
Need to define "tiny" and "real" because it would mean different things to different people. Bitcoin won't replace everyday spending for a while yet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:58:37
I was just going by the original picture that implied it was. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:03:11
Too soon to make that call in my opinion. I hope it is one day.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:06:26
Popcorn ready.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:27:45
I shudder to think of people taking out loans to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:36:05
Has the potential to be easier than cash, absolutely. But we're not there yet. A long and uncertain road ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:40:27
I may be mistaken but I thought Bitcoin was made for everyday spending at its inception. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:50:38
That'll one day become unstuck.
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:37:29
“I’m afraid I can’t let you do that, Dave”
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:21:16
You don't have $6000. Unless you cash out, it's all theoretical.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:39:27
I think that ship has sailed. It's digital gold now. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:21:03
The flaw in this is Bitcoin isn't currently better than money. Money is easier to use and spend. Bitcoin is more like Gold.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:07:57
It's an "if it is" though. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:13:55
Many people choose to ignore the "invest only what you're willing to lose" rule.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:32:59
You could absolutely cash out right now for $6000. But that isn't guaranteed. What goes up, can go down.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:22:14
True. But with that scenario you may be dead either way. Give mugger passwords or don't, they can still kill you.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:41:20
You're either a genius or a lunatic!
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:48:44
Oops. Oh well, it will rise long term.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:09:25
You describe the conundrum with Bitcoin perfectly.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:34:19
You're only seeing one side. Those that take risks also (sometimes) take large falls. If you only see one side you come off as an amateur investor. You could be right in 6 months. You could be wrong in 6 months. It is not a locked in guarantee.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:36:52
I think as long as your position in bitcoin (or anything, for that matter) wouldn't financially ruin you if it crashed, you're okay.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:23:55
Here we go again...
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:39:14
r/CreepyPMs :/
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:15:35
Too early to make that call. Only a fool would see one side of the (bit)coin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:35:16
Being young, you can at least recover with years of earning potential if it doesn't meet expectations.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:20:20
Witty, bro!
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:45:09
FOMO is a tough conundrum. I do t think Amazon will touch BTC until it's stable. Price fluctuations mean they could potentially lose out big time. They're not that silly. Long way off for Amazon if at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:32:03
Yes, I'm taking the risk also and believe in the technology. I just feel with the recent surge there's a bit too much confidence that this is "omg - free money!!!!" and people have thrown reality out the window. A wise investor would be prudent to keep things in perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:46:24
"Many people" means in general. I didn't reference the OP specifically. You need to re-read.
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:48:17
Gold isn’t useless. It’s used in electronics, medicine, dentistry, and watch-making to name a few.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:49:08
I stopped reading OPs post when I read this. Clearly doesn't understand crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:42:25
Because it's not guaranteed to go up. Everyone thinks this is a to the moon type investment. At any moment, things could change.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:10:08
Debatable. In my opinion, until it's mainstream and we're all using it for purchases, day in day out, it's not a revolution.
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:39:01
mandelbaum! mandelbaum!
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:05:03
How is it dangerous?
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:07:30
They’ll only go crypto when there’s a stable coin with little volatility. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:48:14
I think your idea has merit. The point of bitcoin was as a replacement currency, not as a replacement gold. If everyone holds, it becomes pointless. I fear this will be bitcoins downfall but not many people want to see that at this point. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:36:56
Holding. It's a slang meme thing that stuck.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:08:57
So they hold the keys even with the blockchain app?
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:46:51
Bitcoin for storing, Litecoin for everyday spending.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:48:11
It's just a piece of paper. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:10:36
Same here, I hesitated on the dip. Waiting the 30th to hopefully buy if it drops.
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:45:15
I wish I had a crystal ball sometimes. I'd love to see where we are in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:18:49
Misleading title. Not confirmed, rumoured.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:19:12
Thanks I'll look into that about the blockchain app :/
@_date: 2017-09-25 09:49:49
I guess that's the big question. Buy now or wait until the 30th?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:26:44
Bitcoin for store, litecoin for spend.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:28:33
Yikes, did it?
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:01:44
It doesn't matter how divisible it is if everyone is HODLing. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:48:47
I don't understand how a mugger is going to gain access to iOS with all security features enabled.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:47:40
Ltc is the front runner.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:13:52
First, they ignore you...
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:52:26
I'll look into IOTA, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:42:27
I think it's one of the biggest issues with Bitcoin. If everyone is HODLing then the currency becomes effectively useless.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:36:03
I bought at its peak :/ I'm jittery but HODLing. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:14:22
It's a long and uncertain road to get to that point.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:59:37
Can confirm here too. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:33:55
I still haven't seen a real need  for a
cold wallet though. Lots of theory, but no real-world cases?
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:02:00
No you can't. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:56:03
They are already the largest purveyor of goods on the internet - they don't need to.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:51:18
Upvoted. The hype around hardware wallets is silly. Suggesting that an OS like iOS is unsafe is also silly. Android, another story, but iOS wallets are as secure as they can basically get while being internet connected.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:35:56
Hourly ��
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:10:34
How are you spending your bitcoin for goods and services? Are shops accepting bitcoin as payment there?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:43:26
That must be a sweet feeling. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:55:38
Do you think there might be a stutter on the 30th?
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:55:18
Anything can cease development at any time, including Trezor and Ledger. "but you still have the hardware wallet, you shout!" Yes. And people still have the Bread app.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:09:40
Use google to learn about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:30:12
"Bitcoin is great! Now give me money."
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:01:54
This is a truth many HODLRS don't want to believe.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:48:09
It absolutely could be 50k. It could also be $500.
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:34:44
It's actually quite ironic to keep them in a bank.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:53:56
Why? Please explain why.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:53:13
Upvoted for tardfork.
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:19:52
Red pill without a doubt.
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:18:56
Yep. I wonder who will be first to market for an app?
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:40:12
Yes, I do see there's a distinction there but my point stands unaddressed.
@_date: 2017-07-08 22:56:59
Thank you for explaining. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:42:13
Out of the loop: what happens august 1?
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:17:00
Can you elabroate on this to a newbie? If I buy from Coinbase, what do I need to do to get a private key?
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:00:06
Maybe I'm not understanding the process and technology completely but I don't see why one can't just transfer the coin to a private vault once buying. Can you explain why that's not possible?
@_date: 2017-06-26 09:58:38
I've recently read that Coinbase seems very shaky/dodgy. I think I'm starting to see what you mean, that CB may not honour transfers to private keys etc. thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:00:31
Got anymore of that cheap bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:37:34
Why can't I just transfer the coins out to my own offline storage?
