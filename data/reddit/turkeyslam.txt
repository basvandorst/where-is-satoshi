Would Google do anything, though? :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:10:09
I didn't do it out of paranoia, I did it mostly out of novelty. Storing substantial cash assets in my brain seemed super cool to me.
I won't be doing anything like this again.
Thank you for the website. I've actually seen it before, but forgot about it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:15:44
Looks like our complaints worked! They're offline.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:10:01
Well, let's serve that as a warning to everyone. This is the only reasonable thing I can see that happened. I lost all of my coins to this. All of them.
I've been so excited about bitcoin too... my gut reaction is to re-invest, but I am completely shell shocked.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:57:49
Yeah, I've learned my lesson. I won't do such a paranoid thing again.
I did it mostly as a novelty, really.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:08:26
Well, that was my initial goal with this. I just misstepped and used a dodgy third party to help me set my shit up.
I spent Bitcoins along the way, but I wanted to put some aside as a store of value. That's what was stolen - all that I had left.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:00:16
I find it very strange as well. I was hoping maybe someone here would have an idea to explain this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:05:03
Thank you very much, my friend. I'll take anything I can get while I start over!
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:07:10
My line of thinking was that I'd be ultra-safe having it in a non-physical medium, so that if some crazy situation like my house burning down happened, I'd use my BRAIN to get it all back!
Yeah, it backfired HARD. Not doing that again.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:32:04
It sure is. I will probably drop little bits and pieces back in, but I think I'm done as far as large investments are concerned...
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:39:19
Thank you for your generosity. You are excellent. :) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:00:49
How does that timestamp translate to central time US?
I hadn't typed the string to the private key in a week or so, so it's not that, but I used my computer earlier today. Nothing Bitcoin related though, other than reading forums.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:45:23
This was me....I wish, with hindisght, I could've gotten my funds out of this address. Nope, it's all gone.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:13:27
Yes indeed
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:45:22
I thought a "brain wallet" was simply a wallet that you access based on info retained in your brain. Sorry for the incorrect nomenclature.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:37:10
That's not exactly what I did here. I didn't "put my money on a wallet site".
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:31:30
Still $10,000. Actually, $10,000.01 and up.
Source: I work in the casino industry and this amount fires up a Currency Transaction Report.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:00:15
It was mostly numbers. Nothing that would be found in the dictionary.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:58:19
No more brainwallets for me, heh.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:03:52
Thanks dude. I'll do anything I can get to restart the building process....
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:40:05
Believe me, I'm going to watch that thing like a freaking HAWK.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:00:34
I don't believe it's a keylogger. I believe it's outright theft from the site owner. The information was logged.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:19:50
I added my BTC little by little until it was all there. I wanted to be "safe" and have all my funds in this one "hidden" address, which turned out to not be the case. :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:38:09
Sound advice for anyone still interested in doing brain wallets.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:15:07
The bitcoin protocol is designed to where you don't NEED to trust anyone. I still have confidence in it. I just used a third party website like an idiot without evaluating the possible consequences.
The address this thing sent to is brand new with no other connections to anything. Unless he forwards my 18.5BTC elsewhere, we'll never be able to identify anything.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:53:01
WOW, just WOW.
This needs to be seen by everyone.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:32:20
Noooottt quite.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:49:46
I did not sell. All my bitcoins were stolen. Either way, I now have zero.
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:10:15
How did this work with "vetify"? Typo, or is that a thing?
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:10:17
A pattern of numbers I invented as a child, with random letters thrown in throughout in a way that was logical to me.
"Hunter2" made me laugh though. Heh
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:49:58
I do have it. What should I do next?
It seems strange that it would move change weeks after the fact, though. I never made a single transaction with it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:19:11
I tried registering over at bitcointalk, but it won't let me PM anyone right off the bat. Is there any way we can show Joric this thread?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:22:22
Same thing happened to me last night.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:30:24
I didn't save a copy because I was too pissed off at it, but I'm pretty sure at least one person here did.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:25:48
Paper wallets are fine, but the ENTIRE process in creating one needs to be offline. Trust nobody.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:00:05
I am a beginner, but I, from the beginning, was very proactive in being informed.
I was simply blinded by the novelty of a brain wallet and I made the error of believing that what I was doing on that website was only on the browser side, like an idiot. It was a lapse in judgment. 
My goal was actually to secure the coins as best as possible, and ironically I did the opposite.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:47:39
I already reported the case to Google. Let's see what they do, if anything.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:52:58
I guess it's my fault for not looking at the code!
I was too immersed in the novelty of the brain wallet that I didn't think clearly. Never again.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:06:58
Thank you for speaking up. It helps at least a bit to know I wasn't the only one scammed by this website.
We need to take it offline NOW.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:47:07
I'm moving all tip money to a wallet.dat on my computer, encrypting it, and putting it in a safe place. No more brain wallet crap for me!
Lesson learned the hard way.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:55:23
It's cool, heh.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:56:23
But with your coins, didn't they get sent to another address DURING another transaction? They weren't like mine, sent arbitrarily out of nowhere, right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:56:16
Something needs to happen to build newbie confidence. It's integral for BTC to survive in the mainstream. What happened to me and what happened to you should never happen.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:02:35
That, he did. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:13:27
I simply did not have a large enough balance for anyone to try it. I did NOT use any dictionary words. My passkey was reminiscent of something like this: "K12987X23876Z34765www1001"
Certainly not an intensely random chain of characters, but also certainly not a bunch of dictionary BS.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:27:49
I tried sending him a PM, but as I'm newly registered it won't let me. I wish I could forward this thread's info to him, as he looks active in the forums still.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:15:44
I bet it did.
You know, while I'm really feeling bad about the whole thing, I have to give it up for a guy who pulled off a pretty brilliant scam.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:36:39
You rule. :D
I'll definitely be doing that. And thanks for the tip!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:09:07
It's clearly the owner of the site. If anyone would be willing to do some detective work, I'd seriously make it worth their while.
I don't have very much money. I bought in relatively cheap, and this amount in BTC became essentially equivalent to the amount of fiat I have right now in real life.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:13:37
Quite strong. Average entropy, but 22 characters in length
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:25:19
Thank you, buddy.
@_date: 2013-02-19 12:33:01
Thanks for the explanation. My client seems to always send funds to the exact same 
"C" address, despite there being three or four other addresses I own inside that wallet. Is there basically any way to make "C" be the address I've created instead of the address that came by default with the wallet? I'm not even really interested in the privacy aspect... mostly just convenience and peace of mind that all my funds are in this "memorized" address.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:23:09
I appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:20:07
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:21:46
18.5btc, that exchanges to a LOT. More than I care to think about.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:01:12
I'm going to load the wallet.dat and see what happens. I appreciate the effort from you btw, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:21:02
Yeah, man. Brutal. :/
Did you come back and give BTC another chance?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:14:56
Excellent news.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:34:25
I was under the impression that this whole thing was done on my side, with the page itself doing all the work instead of relaying it to a server. I guess I was dead wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:09:50
Yeah, I did that dude. It's gone. sigh... :(
