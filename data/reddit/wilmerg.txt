Okay! I will try again.
Edit 1: Minimum Eth error is gone when I put 0.1 BTC there. Unfortunately I don't have 0.1 BTC at the moment. Will try again later.
Edit 2: Orders configuration working right.

Congrats! for launching the site. I just signed up. What is the minimum order to place?
I tried to place a 0.0001 btc buy against eth. I'm confused. The order is not created. It says Minimum amount Eth on the Amount of bitcoin field. It is not accepting. 
Need a better guide to understand the system well. Also the Order configuration screen won't allow me to type % for +/-. It says minimum 2.34. But where should I type the % I want?

Thanks. It made to sit before the world clock for more than 10 minutes in nervous. This is awesome to win. Keep promoting more if you're affordable. 
Happy Thanksgiving day.
