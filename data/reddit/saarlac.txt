Meanwhile just 1 bitcoin would solve lots of my problems.

Coinbase is the storefront on main street. Gdax is the warehouse club out in the sticks. The store is for people walking in off the street to make quick purchases. The warehouse club is for people willing to deal with slightly more effort but in return to get better deals. Use the warehouse club.

I put my first $100 in just tonight. Been fun watching it grow and shrink.

4:17am cst. My issue was probably ad blocker related. I used their app and everything was fine.

So like load money into Coinbase via bank deposit or whatever and then use that through gdax with a buy order instead of just outright buying like a normal transaction?

That is my basic plan. I’m just going to toss money in the HODL hole a little at a time. Started on Coinbase. Should I buy via gdax for better fees? Or does it matter?

You can use Blockfolio to create fictional transactions at fictional prices and see the results at today’s prices. Otherwise use a calculator and do simple math.

I’m working on no sex with the wife December. It’s going “well” so far...

After all this time I finally dove in with $100 at 12.6 earlier. Advice for a total noob?

I signed up verified and purchased my first tiny amount of BTC on Coinbase in under 10 minutes total. Most of that time was trying to get my phones camera to take a pic of my dl.

If you have an apple and you sell it to me for $1 and the next day you want it back and I tell you the price is now $10,000... you pay me $10,000 and get the apple back. Same thing man. This isn’t complicated.

First time buy last night at 12.6

Any amount you can afford to lose is a good amount to start with. It will either grow or shrink.

My wife would do that. We need better wives.
