If I recall correctly - Lightning wallets/nodes must be kept online. This makes usage on mobile phones troublesome. (Which sucks because small transactions like coffee are an ideal use case for lightning.)
Does this implementation solve that problem in some way? Like maybe Electrum hosts the node and the app is just a way to control it?
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:21:26
You can disagree with their implementation, but that is part of the beauty of crypto. 
Don’t like the rules of the game, feel free to change them and see if people like your rules better.  That is what they did.
It is a voluntary system that allows for innovation.
In short - the system worked exactly as intended.

Thank you for your input! Another commenter mentioned watchtowers as well. I should read up on those.
(Also - it makes me really want to play Age of Empires 2.)

Well - like it or not that is a significant portion of US consumers, so it is probably an issue worth considering. Hopefully watchtowers fill that need.

How long can you be offline before there is any sort of risk? (For arguments sake - let’s ignore whether or not the risk is to your advantage.)
You are correct that something like lost connectivity is like to be short lived (same with battery life), but a bricked phone could be problematic. Also iOS apps are notoriously hard to implement offline functionality into. For iOS you should just assume that when you background an app that it is no longer operational.

I am aware and that is why I specified the following:
“reusing addresses is actually costing them less assuming you use the same fee rate for each of those hypothetical transactions”
There are ways to minimize the impact such as what you mentioned, however this doesn’t change the transaction size.
To clarify, I 100% agree with you, but that wasn’t the main point of my comment. I apologize if that was not clear.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:11:48
I think those fees are inevitable.
Let’s say I want to send 1 BTC from Wallet A to Wallet C. Wallet A is is comprised of 5 inputs @ 0.2 BTC each.
The size to send from A to C is ~944 bytes if I did my math correctly.
If we consolidate first by moving coins from A to B (a Wallet I also on) to C, I spend more.
This size to send from A to B is the same ~944 bytes and now I add on the additional transaction of B to C of ~224 bytes. The total from A&gt;B&gt;C is ~1168 bytes.
So, reusing addresses is actually costing them less assuming you use the same fee rate for each of those hypothetical transactions. (Though practically if you are consolidating your funds you can pick a lower rate because you may not need a quick confirmation)
Edit: The main point of this post is to illustrate transaction size, not cost. There are ways to minimize cost at X size as the reply to this comment points out.

This is some political-ass bullshit.
Nobody owns the Bitcoin “brand”. I have the strong suspicion that this is an attempt to belittle their currency by replacing the name with a derogatory slur. This destructive, petty infighting. (And it goes both ways)
If you don’t like Bitcoin Cash, fine. If Cash doesn’t like Core, fine. Do your own thing. Why put so much freaking energy into slandering the other? Do you have nothing more to contribute to the community?
The common argument for renaming that I have heard is to help new users, but to achieve this by disrespecting another community seems strange. It feels like y’all are just using new users and an excuse to crap on a competing currency - and that is some grade-A bullshit.
It sucks if new users get confused, but welcome to the Wild West. Let’s educate them instead of defacing another currency’s name.
Edit: To clarify, this is not at all a slam on the community as a whole. I think most of you are lovely people. But, as we fragment due to our size and differing ideologies, we must be cautious to not attack one another. We may not agree on implementation, but we have the same end goal. Let’s learn from the success and failings of each other.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:38:38
If things get shitty fast enough - absolutely.
My concern is ISPs making the internet worse, but slowly.
For example, let’s look at mass surveillance. 10 or 20 years ago it would be a ludicrous concept. You ought’ to wear a tinfoil hat if you believed that.
But today it doesn’t feel like people care. Our privacy has been slowly eroded so it feels like it has always kinda been this way.
TLDR - hard to have a good frame of reference if things happen slowly.

I imagine lightening would fix it by offloading transactions.
That said, having increased the block size to alleviate current transaction issues would have prevented Bitcoin from becoming functionally handicapped.

Sorry! That was supposed to be a reply on another comment ��

My apologies - I should have clarified. I wasn’t speaking to you in regards to “fuck coinbase/Bitcoin Cash”. It was an observation about the general state of this subreddit at the moment. 
I totally agree a notice of adding coins (in x days) would generally be a good practice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:13:31
Bitcoin Cash is  pretty alluring when you look at $25 fees for Bitcoin. Also they talked about this months ago; pretty sure I even have the email saved.
I don’t know why people are calling conspiracy when they were transparent and the addition is simply practical.
What are you afraid of?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:28:37
I’m disappointed by the number of upvotes this has. I’m even more disappointed that such ignorant pettiness made it to the front page.
I wish people would just stop being salty about Bitcoin Cash. Yes they share a name. Yes they share code. But that is the point. This is a competitive free market and posts like this echo of intellectual property. Last I checked, nobody owns the Bitcoin brand.
I’d love to see technical competition instead of ad hominem attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:08:26
They can adjust their block size, so I don’t think they will face this same problem. 
However, the scaling obstacle Bitcoin Cash could face is storage capacity.
BTC and BCH took different approaches, but neither have solved scaling issues yet. BCH has just pushed it off into the future.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:07
I am by no means an expert on this subject, but have been pondering it recently.
There are, as I see it, four main problems.
1. Much of the existing infrastructure is owned by telecom companies
2. If we build a mesh network, completely independent from existing ISPs - how do we connect cities or, even worse, rural inhabitants 
3. If we start a campaign towards mesh networks, telecom is going to lobby hard against it. They are already trying to fight municipal internet in Colorado and Washington.
4. Convincing people to engage in the network. It must be as good if not better than their existing internet experience. Right now, it is probably fine, but if ISPs get shitty (post NN) we will have quite the opportunity.
I seriously hope we can make it happen. Decentralized Internet is critically important in regard to protecting the free flow of information. This are all issues we can overcome, but they are major hurdles.
Edit: added a 4th obstacle 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:43
Decentralized exchange - hell yeah. Obstacle is the network fees :/

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:15:22
Depends on context. I recognize that some people will use it shorthand when talking. Which, fine - whatever.
But - in this context, modifying its listing on CMC (and I’ve seen this topic brought up for other sites), seems rather strange. We would be misrepresenting the name of the coin in a manner inconsistent with other entries on the list. That seems disrespectful. I argue we ought to list all coins in a consistent manner.
Edit: Reworded a little bit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:25:07
Going from Wallet A to Wallet C (directly) is a smaller total transaction size than A to B to C. Check my math.
Now, if we assume both cases were to happen at the same fee rate, A to C directly would cost less because the transaction is a smaller size.
I can break it down into the equation if you would prefer.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:57:47
“word or grammatical form expressing a negative connotation or a low opinion of someone or something, showing a lack of respect for someone or something”
Proposing to change the listings to BCash is disrespectful as it is not full expressing the name of the currency whereas we do it for all other currencies. It is marginalizing Bitcoin Cash to fit what appears to be an anti-Bitcoin Cash agenda.
It isn’t about safe spaces or whatever. It is about calling it what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:47:22
If they treated the release of Bitcoin Cash differently than others (particularly in a detrimental way) I can see how there is cause of concern. But, if they were consistent, then I feel like such outrage/cry of conspiracy is unwarranted.
Additionally, these markets don’t close so mid day or mid night may not make much difference. That said, picking a low average volume time of day and bringing the system down for scheduled maintenance would have probably been a better way to handle it. GDAX has been wonky ever since; my charts sometimes only partially load.
TLDR - if they are consistent, I feel like people are making more fuss than necessary. If there was some strange, I get it, but I think there are more constructive ways to approach this than “fuck Coinbase/Bitcoin Cash” and claiming conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:50:29
Ohhhhhh I see.
Basically having a bunch of inputs to a single address. Though, perhaps wallet is a more appropriate term?
I very much appreciate you asking this question because it has illustrated that I’m fuzzy about this particular part of the process.

Did they notify us ahead of time when they adde Litecoin or Ethereum? (I don’t remember- honest question)
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:57:31
Not necessarily more power. Andreas Antonopolous has a good talk on Bitcoins energy consumption.
First - high energy use is a way of keeping it secure (given the POW model).
Second - we can scale Bitcoin while not needing to increase power usage (see BCH). 
Basically we may want a resource intensive crypto to act as a security backbone, but we can build more efficient layers on top (or as completely separate cryptos). The power consumption doesn’t need to scale linearly in order for transaction volume to scale. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:53:51
It’s “inefficiency” is part of it’s security model.
It is extremely risky to try to attack the network because of how resource intensive an attack is and if you fail you have lost a ton of money.
Bitcoin itself my not scale, but the ecosystem will (lightning network, PoS cryptos, etc). Bitcoin (or some other POW crypto) could be a backbone to that ecosystem; the most secure layer so to speak.
Or maybe we will find out that there are more efficient options that don’t compromise security; idk what the future holds - I’m just highlighting the rationale behind the power consumption.

I'm not privy to the technical details (I've been a fairly passive observer of this debate) so take this with a grain of salt, but I see no reason that a floating/adjustable block size would be hindered by Segwit. Perhaps the technical implementation may change, but the concept should still be doable.
If my theory is wrong or I'm missing an important detail, I'm all ears.

I'm not opposed to BU, but I'd rather see Segwit activate now, solving the capacity problems and supporting cool things like Lightning, and have a BU-like approach more thoroughly fleshed out and tested. Perhaps an alt-coin (so as to not confuse newcomers by having 2 versions of Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:59:03

While I understand that sentiment, we I don't think we have enough information about this users case to logically conclude that it is "pointless". Consequently, the statement of it being pointless seems presumptuous.
Note: Edited for brevity
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:18:15
This really only matters if a substantial amount of others think like you; you alone are not likely to provide adequate security for the network. Even if a lot of people share your sentiment, you are still up against large centralized mining entities that can switch what they mine (BTC/BCH) on a whim. 
Mining at a loss isn't practical or sustainable. If you need to do that, there is probably a major dysfunction (incentives). We need to identify that and work on a solution.

If you ban mixers, people will just find another way. The root causes of issues need to be addressed, not the medium by which they occur at current. Otherwise pursuit of such problems is really just a snake eating its own tail.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:54:13
Totally. I hope that Bitcoin has as much freedom to grow as possible.
I'm merely meaning to point out the silly nature of the goal to "ban mixers". It won't evoke the change Interpol seems to want, but it will be an inconvenience we in the community need to put up with.

North Dakota had an initiative for full legalization as well.
Unfortunately we didn't have enough petition signatures to get into the primary (largely as consequence of people not turning petitions in/turning in late). 
But, if all goes well, we should make it into the 2018 primary. The state told the head of the initiative that the signatures collected so far should roll into 2018, so we have 2 years to collect the remaining deficit + buffer.

I’ve thought about this. The problem is you are going to need to buy a very expensive space heater. At that point, you might as well just buy a normal asic.

If a considerable amount of volume is moved to lightning, one off transactions on the main chain should become cheaper.
I don’t mean to imply that lightning alone will solve our scaling issues, but it is a meaningful start to what I hope becomes many different scaling solutions.
It’s also worth noting that Bitcoin doesn’t need to be the end-all be-all. We can have different currencies that serve different purposes (and features like atomic swap can make it a seamless user experience for the average Joe).
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:37:17
That level of security (if possible) will happen with or without government consent. The only difference is whether or not "normal" people are allowed to use it.

@_date: 2018-11-15 22:40:28
To be fair - BCH addressed an immediate problem. Blocks were full, fees were high, and as a result BTC was pretty much unusable. At least you could cheaply transact on BCH until a true scaling improvement is implemented.
SV isn’t addressing any immediate problem nor does it address scalability.
Edit: Yes - there were alternatives like LTC that had a better tps, but I’m talking specifically the Bitcoin codebase.
