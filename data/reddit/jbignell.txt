I think I would have set it up, considering the cost of the ATM. Plus I would have had a media promotion around "Beer for Bitcoins!"

That is the biggest reason why I think Bitcoin will struggle to be a leader in the financial sector.
I support bitcoin and have bitcoin in my iphone wallet, but I have never had a chance to use it. Or a time were I felt that it would be easier to use my bitcoin. I just kinda forgot about it and never crossed my mind.

I heard about it on a podcast and then set up mining software on my computer. I liked the idea.

What was the first custom made hardware for bitcoins?

I think the first miner was puddinpop's CUDA miner. But that was just a quick search online. I am going to spend sometime looking into this...interesting idea to save the first miners.

It's not so much as my reason, but that my wife, or parents or social group has not  wanted to or needed Bitcoin.  I haven't heard anyone say I wish I had some Bitcoin so that I could buy this product....No one has a reason yet.

Bitcoin has made people rich, but how will Bitcoins users enrich their communities. That is the untold story of Bitcoin, that the media isn't talking about.

People want it to drop so they can purchase low and sell high!

How did you select your community? Was it just were you live, or did demographics play in your location selection?
