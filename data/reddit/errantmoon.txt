Yes I am.
That's why I read your post. I was interested in your GF's interaction with bitcoin.

These are not the documents you are looking for.

I make it a policy to always "consciously resist chaos elephant."

My husband and I are both obsessed. We are constantly saying to each other things like: "Can you believe everyone else is just walking around thinking everything's the same?" and "Hey, bitcoin auditing", "bitcoin musicsharing" "bitcoin patenting" ... and now it's just evolved into: "because... bitcoin!"
edit: in our case it's the kids seeing us on our laptops saying: "so how's bitcoin?"

Just did a search and found one bitcoin wallet which has apparently been in the app store since at least May 15. ANX Vault from the Hong Kong exchange.

You and me both. It's just tiresome that so many posts that mention women/GFs/girls have the nudge nudge wink wink sex object comments or the "oh you didn't mean woman/GF/girl as sex object" surprise comment. Like a woman's business is so often assumed to be a sex business. The comments are boring and predictable, but still manage to get upvotes.
Fortunately I am old enough to realise there are lots of men and boys here who are immature in the way they relate to women online. 
Also fortunately, there are also lots of interesting non-sexist men with great comments who don't take that bait. I love being part of this brave new world and since I first came here a couple of months ago as a lurker I've been addicted to bitcoin and the discussions of its potential.
But I've got to say that the sleazy comments are extremely off-putting and has overall made me less enthusiastic to read and participate in the reddit. So I guess the answer to getting more women (if they're anything like me) to participate in bitcoin (via this reddit at least), is that - no we don't need a pink coin for fuck's sake - we just need to not be so frequently referred to as sex objects or have our businesses mistaken for porn work.
The immaturity should go away with age and emotional education but in the meantime, down vote if you want to see less of it. That's what I do.

Hey thanks! My first changetip! Gonna have fun tipping on!

Great initiative. People interested in different models of economic participation are a perfect audience for bitcoin. Hope I can be there...

He'd be great. Can he organise a meetup at that snug little ranch of his?
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:28:24
Glad your GF was fine with it. It'd be interesting to see how many women on this reddit feel ok about the frequency of these types of 'jokes' though. I find it kinda boring how often the "oh! you didn't mean sex work" 'joke' comes up.
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:13:32
LOL that is funny. Almost as funny as playing spot the woman at bitcoin meetups or counting 'we need to get more women involved in bitcoin' comments. Anyway. Good luck to your GF.

The sexism on this reddit is really off-putting. Every comment like this just makes me feel like it's not the place for me. What a shame for bitcoin that its flagship reddit is like this.
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:36:01
Ok thanks!

How do you collect a changetip?
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:14:30
Loved the video. You should put your public address in the youtube description though. Great to see the small amounts you had being used to give people their first coin. I think we all can relate to that feeling of excitement.

They have one already! Craftcoin:
