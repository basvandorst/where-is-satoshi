yeah but to use bitcoin as cash it has to be transferred to a bank (as far as I know) which takes days, thus my question :p

COINBASE has been unresponsive and my transfers have gone from instant to very long.

I purchased some bitcoins a few days ago.. coincidentally they're not due to arrive until August 1st.
They're typically instant and not surpringsly no response from Coinbase.
Any clue what will happen to my purchase come the 1st ?
Thanks for the thread and your reply.

Instant meaning within an hr or so. It was after I verified my account.
