At the end of the day, an open source project's success depends on the quality of the maintainers. No single feature would ever be able account for the loss of an experienced, battle-tested team of software engineers. Even if I did think doubling the block size was wise in the short term (which I don't), there is no way I could get on board with a project who has a team of a single developer. Let alone a developer with no consensus experience. The corporations who are backing this seem unaware of this, or they just vastly undervalued the importance of engineering in a project as nuanced as bitcoin.

Software development has a lot more to it than just the "code."

I know someone who was in a similar boat. Forgot their encryption password for 100k, eventually it hit them a few weeks later. Talk to people you acquainted with often during that period and it may trigger a memory.

You can run a pruned node which doesn't require 100gb. More like 1g
