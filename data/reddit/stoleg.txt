My god that voice
It would be better with a younger, more soothing, casual voice

Guys please take down this post. This is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. We shouldn't bring a bunch of college students over to Africa just to contract it and bring it back here. If we encourage people to go to ebola-ravaged countries, it will force us to take even more precautions against these awful diseases. Honestly, these third-world countries just contract more diseases and expect us to save them. Last season it was malaria, now it's ebola. They already repopulate like cockroaches, and it is part of their genes to die early and still have crazy high populations. Instead we should invest our bitcoin into a wall to protect our women from the Africans like our president Obama. He wants to bring the americans down, while taking our hard earned tax money to make his native country better. Where's the birth certificate?
