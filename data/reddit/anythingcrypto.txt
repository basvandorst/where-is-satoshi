See our answer to CaptainTrips1921, the fees seem to have dropped drastically since posting the guide.

At the time of writing the article we made a test payment with a Ledger, this was the amount it prompted for a fast transaction. Since posting the guide this seems to have dropped.

We'll look into adding this! :)

There are lots of websites comparing exchanges by performance/security/features:
I guess just keep in mind many of these comparisons will be biased, often only listing exchanges that have affiliate programs. Personally we think Kraken is pretty good for depositing fiat - albeit very slow at the moment (and also very slow during dips). We're trying out CEX.IO, but it seems to be better suited to much larger deposits/withdrawals, and buy/sell prices seem much higher than many exchanges. eToro is always an option - charging very high fees, but offering good uptime during dips. :)

Looking at that on the Bitcoin rich list really puts it into perspective:

I think the column on the far right is how much of the hashrate needed is available to rent on [Nicehash]( Given that's only 2&amp; for Bitcoin, I guess it would cost far more than the $463k listed as you'd have to buy all the hardware needed to achieve the other 98&amp; (which I think would be in the range of around 2.34m S9's, which would cost several hundred million $). I guess this means the biggest risk for Bitcoin is people/groups controlling this amount of hardware already.

eToro seem to be everywhere at the moment with ads, seen them at lots of London train stations &amp; even the finance sections of London\-based newspapers.

We run a site that has a payment system and is based in the crypto space, and we're finding that being able to accept payments in crypto is great! We have customers all over the world so need to price things in USD, but we're based in the UK so need to convert that to GBP. For fiat-based processors there are lots of fees associated with this as you need to pay processing fees and then currency conversion fees (you're talking like 4-6&amp; start to finish in fees), but for crypto processors we're currently using one that charges like 1-1.5&amp; total start to finish! :D

The point made where most people think fiat currencies are backed by gold is really interesting. When you're in the crypto space for a while I guess that kind of info becomes common knowledge, but your average person prior to being involved in crypto likely wouldn't even know what 'fiat' means unless they have a finance background. (Or a crypto enthusiast telling them!)

That wasn't our goal when writing this. In the guide we first explain what Coinbase Custody is, then we explain why it could have a big impact on the crypto space, and then at the bottom we talk about its relationship to Bitcoin's price, in particular how it might not cause Bitcoin's price to increase in the medium-term.
So yes we're pro-Coinbase in parts, but we also try to give opposing views to ensure it's objective (e.g. not 'shilling'). I wonder if you saw this bottom section, but still think it's too biased?
