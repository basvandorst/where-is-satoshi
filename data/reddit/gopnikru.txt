How can anyone with a brain pay 5$ to be able to buy a product that costs 5$?

Sign of a bubble.

Today, nobody would ever buy a pizza with Bitcoin when you have to pay 5$ in fees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:14:51
Of course you can. Because you don’t actually use it at all.

Blockstream (AXA (Banks) etc ...) hijacked Bitcoin so that we use Lightning Network. They can then add additional paid services for businesses. Satoshi Nakamoto didn't create Bitcoin for that purpose. It was "Peer-to-peer electronic cash system" to bypass banks. The purpose was not to team up with banks so they can get even more profit. Not putting any penny in this bubble. Have fun holding the time bomb. Until you sell, you have no money.

Because it's smarter to pay 50$ in fees (in 5 years) to be able to buy a 2$ coffee? Not sure who should laugh.

Have fun in your bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:37:33
99%? huh?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:25:20
Buy high sell low huh? Nobody knows if there won’t be another enormous dump after such a run.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:40:49
Because most of merchants don't accept Bitcoin Cash yet.

Thoughts on Segwit2x FUD? I think it will plummet in the middle of October.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:27:56
Yea but the price will crash in October because of segwit2x FUD

People are trading BCH for BTC so they get a lot of s2x to sell. Wait to be closer to November 19th, some other people will panic sell

It rose because 25m Tethers yesterday were created out of thin air to buy Bitcoin. They then margin long. Ask Bitfinex.
