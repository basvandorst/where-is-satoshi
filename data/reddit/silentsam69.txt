Also what if there is a market one day for buying tiny value items. Even virtual services that cost pennies. The fee may cause those types of transactions to go somewhere besides Bitcoin.

They are the kind of idiots we need to get rid of. What a stupid idea that the blockchain can't record billions of transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:51:12
It is already recognised as such. It has already been declared a currency to the public though. If you don't let it be a currency then most people will just decide that it failed.
You have to take public persephone into account. If you don't then you are missing one of the most important factors.
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:40:16
I still don't understand how we are supposed to handle all the transactions with such a tiny block size. I have heard good points on both sides, but it seems those not for even a small increase are ignoring the fact that if more people want to use Bitcoin we need more room for transactions.
Unless those not for increasing the size at all actually want to stop Bitcoin from becoming more commonly used. Maybe they want Bitcoin used for something other than currency.

It does piss people off though when mods either moderate in order to force or shape a discussion how they wish it to go.
It also pisses people off when mods moderate in a way that goes against the very nature of the discussion that has arose mutually with the culture of that community.

So in the past Bitcoin was said to fail because the price was not steady. Now the price is steady because it is a failure...
@_date: 2015-12-14 11:55:27
It doesn't stop that, hmm, that could still work.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:56:15
I see. The centralisation concerns are interesting. I guess you might see increased investments into mining farms if that was the case.
I can see why increases might need to be done slowly as needed.
I also agree that some small increase is needed as traffic increases.

I don't see this leading to not accepting Bitcoin.  I see it as a way to choose nor to do business with an individual.

Hmm, There needs to be tablets with software that will generate a new wallet for each transaction for the bar tender, and then Once you send the bitcoin the bartender would see the bitcoin as incoming and know it was for that transaction.
I think they could even recycle those wallets after a short time, or after moving all the bitcoin to one wallet in the end.
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:12:25
They do that because of tax issues. I would say it is because of regulations they do that. Once regulations and governments no longer try to stop it then things will likely change. Then companies will be able to use it to buy off of suppliers. There are already some businesses that do this, although very few.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:25:19
That is the best idea. Just telling them to go look for themselves is ignorant.

You are going to have to say more than that to make some sense. I only say supposedly because I am not looking at their software or hardware.
I do have reason to trust their service more than others, but I thought others here might no more. It seems that is not the case.

That is not at all what the OP was saying. Are you trying to misread the OP?

Drop Box isn't secure... What do people think of MEGA?
For those without a link to the site. They supposedly have your computer encrypt it before sending, so that they do not even know what you have on their servers.
Also, would it be double encrypted if I sent an encrypted wallet to them? Would that be any more secure?
Edit: Those who down vote a question are idiots, or trying to hurt bitcoin on purpose.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:25:33
I figured the idea was obvious. I was thinking of getting something like that coded up for the student run cafe at my university. I already have the general manager looking into the idea of accepting bitcoin, and I figure this would be the best way for a business to do a transaction. It would be about the same amount of time as an interac purchase, with far less button pushing. It might even be faster.
Please just take it and run with it.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:24:51
I love the idea of getting rid of pools. Not sure how to do it though. Some distributed payment might also be manipulated. If we split payment among all contributes, then pools would get paid as only one, and discourage pooling, but encourage the opposite. People making many individual miners.
Not sure which is more exploitable. At least those making many individual miners would never be able to get to 51% though. Especially with others trying the same things.
Some kind of pay per contributor that would see pools as one individual might help, but would each contributor be paid the same, or would hash rate some into effect, with large hash rates being capped or paid at a diminishing rate to again discourage pools.
No idea, I hope something is done though.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:26:04
Well then simply answer them, and provide the link.
No need to be a dick and to increase feelings of superiority.

@_date: 2016-01-13 16:48:21
From what I can see though it is the people pushing for a change that want Bitcoin to stay the same. They want to to remain a currency.
It seems those against the change have actually stated that they want it to change. I think the idea was to turn it into an asset register or something else. The only concern I hear is about centralisation, but that doesn't seem very serious.
It seems many merchants and early adopters may leave Bitcoin if it does remain a currency. They just want to increase the amount of transaction a block can handle. which loos like it will badly need soon. Bitcoin hasn't been adopted enough for any changes.
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:10:46
From what I understand the double spend was not always easy to do. With the recent block size issue a Dev highlighted thr problem by doing it himself easily by himself.
I can't remember at the moment, but I think it revolved around making a small purchase that was accepted, and then doing the double spend with a higher fee to have that transaction taken instead.
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:15:27
Core devs sure seem to don't mind security flaws. Why not just increase the block size instead of creating holes in the system with unnecessarily complicated procedures?
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:31:52
I think this might be part of the reason we have seen a recent push to stop using Bitcoin as a currency, and instead use it for asset registry or some other ideas.
I think it is pressure to make it something banking systems would use, but not something we could use. Making the innovation work for the banks instead of for the people.
Kind of a horrible perversion of Bitcoin in a way.
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:44:54
Waiting on Bitcoin Classic instead.
Bitcoin is a currency, not a settlement system. Go make an Altcoin if you want something different.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:25:01
I don't think anyone is saying it depended on him. I think the point is that the fight over block size has lead to the point where Bitcoin is not very useful anymore.
As long as a few people can prevent the block size increase then Bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:00:43
There has been some good talk over at r/btc as well lately about how some of these features work in order to get rid of any misconceptions.
I am started to come around to some of the new ideas. I can't help but feel that allowing at tiny increase of 2MB block size helps give time to get those new features working securely.
Bitcoin should not be coded like EA makes games. Rushed and broken in need of fixing later. Trust and security are the value of the blockchain and can not be compromised to rush new features.
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:45:24
Funny how the sound reasoning only seems to come from those who want to increase the block size.
Those against the increase either do not understand the issue. have bought into misinformation, or are actively trying to turn Bitcoin into a settlement system instead of a digital currency. In other words they want to make Bitcoin into something it is not.
Core developers should go make a new blockchain system instead of changing what the Bitcoin community already built.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:11:14
It may not be dead, but there has been a major problem going on, and it has exposed just how centralised Bitcoin currently is. It seems like so few people are against the block size increase, or maybe I just don't hear much of anyone who is against the increase outside of a small core group.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:27:00
Sure you can do that during low points in spending. The fact that it can not process more than 3 transactions per second shows how horribly limited it is though.
If it is peaking out now with so little adoption it shows the system just can not handle being used as a major payment option.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:04:21
It has started not working. The problems have retailers abandoning it. So now that it will fork it will start working properly again.
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:12:23
Other way around obviously. Much needed block size hard fork now, and SegWit and or LN soft fork if they are completed.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:03:27
Why are people acting as if XT isn't Bitcoin? Isn't it just a hard fork possibility?
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:09:58
So all those nearly 100% full blocks were what?
@_date: 2016-01-24 14:46:11
Sounds interesting.
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:39:41
It doesn't work that well when blocks are easily filled and transaction confirmation times start taking hours or days, or just get dropped. Also the fees are sometimes higher than if they used banks, making Bitcoin unompetitive.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:09:28
Anything that increases the block size is a good thing. It still boggles the mind that some people can't see the obvious pitfalls of not increasing the block size.
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:53:17
Bitcoin has hard forked in the past though. I guess that means the Bitcoin we have today is not the Bitcoin we had before previous hard forks.
If a majority of mining power moved to XT wouldn't that be how Bitcoin is meant to work? Isn't that how the people have their say in Bitcoin? It would just show a majority wanted the block size increased, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:27:36
It is a useful place for him to be. It allows him to use the control he has here to push an agenda. Somehow some people believe they will transform Bitcoin into something better than a currency by not increasing the block limit and allowing it to fail as a currency.
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:22:45
This just seems like a propaganda piece.
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:23:26
I see, so this issue with this hard fork, if I have this right, is that if the community does move to XT or some other version of Bitcoin the people who disagree with that hard fork would try to continue to maintain the old version? This leading to two different coins trying to call themselves Bitcoin being the issue?
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:59:36
Doesn't change the fact that they made mistakes.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:57:09
I don't invest in dollars, I spend them. The same goes for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:21:49
Well there is the major point of the transactions not working because some few have decided the community is wrong and won't increase the block size limit, which is causing back logs and fees to increase.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:22:49
There is a lot of people unhappy with LN, and SegWit, etc. In the meantime Bitcoin blocks are often full and transaction back logs are becoming a big problem.
If core developers think they could eventually get those systems to work safely that is interesting, but until then the block size needs to increase. It would fix the current problem easily, and it wouldn't lead to decentralization or others strange problems they assume. Not to mention it would have stopped all the drama.
It is just too bad the r/Bitcoin mods have done so much damage to the community, and the public face of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-30 07:08:47
I think that a hard fork would look good for Bitcoin in general as it would show how well the system work to self correct.
Right now Bitcoin looks bad because it looks centralised. It looks like all the control is in the hand of a few people who need to be trusted on order to trust Bitcoin. A hard fork would show that Bitcoin can not be held hostage by a small group of developers.
Classic is good for fixing the public image of Bitcoin, and it is good for adjusting to a 2MB block size without huge deviation in any other way.
@_date: 2016-01-26 03:00:36
I'll bite. How is it that? I'm trying to find a reason to see both sides as having a point but so far core just looks bad.
@_date: 2016-01-27 20:30:14
Well being willing to pay more has already caused a double spend attack. So I think it is potentially crippling.
Obviously it isn't broken, but it when it starts peaking out it makes stores want to stop accepting Bitcoin. Thus is already happening as store say they can't wait that long for confirmations.
I won't say Bitcoin is broken because of full blocks, but it is damaging when it allows double spends.
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:01:53
I just can't get over these foolish people who are against increasing the block size. They are just disconnected from reality it seems.
They should just go make an alt  coin and leave Bitcoin alone.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:27:20
Mods are the worst thing about reddit. I laugh at how the pretend they are the only thing standing between us an thousands of spam posts.
If they only stopped spam I would be happy but it seems most all mods on any subreddit are just getting rid of opinions they dislike.
Mods suck and should suck it.
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:00:49
Make sure that when it is available you run a Bitcoin-Classic node in order to really support the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:57:26
So you also want Bitcoin to be slower and more expensive than banks?

I never said we should get rid of moderators. Just that many are not as impartial as they act.
I used r/atheism as an example because when the moderators took the sub from the original creator and mod they pretty much ruined the community.
They also used words like thoughtful discussion. The problem is when they get to decide what is and is not thoughtful discussion. I don't mind if a person who is not that bright makes a post and doesn't do well. That doesn't mean they were not trying for thoughtful discussion. Why discourage then by saying they were not trying to have a good discussion.
r/atheism was never just anti-Christian. They were always anti-all religions. Just because most people posting lives in the west and mainly dealt with Christianity, and so posted about it a lot, doesn't mean that is all that they were.
Let the voting system decide what is thoughtful discussion. Not the opinion of some pseudo-intellectual.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:37:55
Just down vote them. There is no need to remove comments when we already have the up and down vote system.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:34:16
I think most of us are too busy hating mods to bother looking into how it works.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:43:43
I never found it that hard to get bitcoin. I just put cash in the ATM and let it scan the QR code on my phone and it sent me bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:08:28
Interesting. I prefer the idea of letting trolls be. Heavy moderation always ruins things. Sometimes when you call someone a troll they were being serious. Stupid, but still serious.
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:07:33
I am not trying to props a slippery slope. Obviously we need mods to prevent spam and advertisers and such.
Stating the obvious need though does not address the growing trend of moderators removing stuff for poor reasons, or reasons subjective to them.
Too many moderators seem to ban people with little to no reason. Mainly because they have ideological disagreements and abuse their power. They think they have good reason I have no doubt. People like to rationalise their mistakes after the fact.
r/atheism, as the example, was a great place that ran with very minimum moderation. The moderators who took over became very overbearing and forced it into subreddit for discussion only despite there already being a subreddit like that which was not popular. They tried to force a thriving community into a pigeon hole that they liked. They pretended it was for good objective reasons but it was in reality for personal petty reasons.
Moderators are people. They are often not nearly as objective as they think.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:37:08
Then Down vote their Comment. Moddershall is not the best move when we can just down vote.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:21:49
I understand what you are saying. The problem is far too often moderators go mad with power and remove stuff based only on how they feel about it.
I think a great example was how some people took over the r/atheism subreddit using technicalities, and then drastically changing the format because they found it juvenile.
Too often the moderators are a bullying minority trying to force their own way on an already working subreddit.
It seems that lately the moderators of reddit are just trying to stop views they disagree with from being spread. Even wanting to remove entire subreddit because they seem them offensive. This is a horrible thing considering how many of us come from cultures that promote free speech or freedom of expression.

When you start putting in cash it does start counting up for you, but by letting me put it in ahead of time I new how much money to pull out. Just giving a conversion ration would have made me less sure, and want a calculator.
Except for the hand scan it didn't take anything more than a regular ATM.
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:16:55
It accepted my phones QR code for the phone wallet. I am planning on using the phone with the ATM, and then moving bitcoins to my wallet from my phone after.
It is a pretty interesting experience. I like that we are getting in on something while it is still kind of new.
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:00:28
It basically was that easy, but done in a different order.
1) First palm scan. 2) Then choose buy or sell.  3)Enter an amount to see the current exchange rate the machine offers. 4) Scan wallet, or have machine make one. 5) Put in cash
This completes the transaction and prints out a receipt. Obviously you keep the QR code printed if you just made a wallet.

I am thinking about buying a wallet from this. Part of me cant help but wonder if they somehow snuck something in to give them access, but I figure they would make more in the long run selling a legit product than they would off of a scam, I just can't help but question. Likely I will be buying it soon though. Making my own would be a bit of a process.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:31:09
Reading this at first made me want to sell my bitcoin.

Nice, he said someone has already bought a ticket with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:57:28
I like the idea of using a tablet. Would I be able to keep the wallet elsewhere, while using the tablet to accept payment to the wallet? I ask because I wouldn't want a disgruntled employee to transfer the bitcoin to their own wallet, or just walking off with our wallet in the device.
Reading your post makes me wonder if we could use a tablet to allow the cashier to input the payment amount, that is updated using the exchange we choose (likely VirtEx or MtGox) and still keep the price set by the dollar. I don't want to make staff change bitcoin prices everyday.
I have seen that some apps change the QR code to include the price, so that the customer can just scan, confirm the price, and send. I figure that would make it as quick and easy as possible for the customer.

I see, so they are treating it as a commodity instead of a currency the same way Canada has. I wonder if China will get bitcoin AM's like we did here. It is nice how it didn't need to be regulated here in Canada. Good for China.

I can see why it got downvoted, and no you were not saying the same message.
Alos, the idea that we will all get rich is part of the backward thinking that makes some people dismiss bitcoin. Syaing early adopters will be rewarded for risk makes sense, but what you said makes it sound like you expect the impossible.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:15:24
Don't worry too much. They great thing about programming is that you can't really lie with math.
Any attempt to take over bitcoin would be met by resistance. The best pool of talent always comes from the public. I hate to make the analogy, but we always know criminals are one step ahead of the police, well the people can stay a step ahead of the regulators.
As long as the community of programmers can stay a step ahead of forces trying to impose bad regulations things should stay good.

It has nothing to do with being cheap. It has to do with debit and cash being equal.
This is why I asked if this was just a rule you have for debit. If you say that for all purchases, then at least you are still treating the two as equal.
If you do this only for debit, then I guess I can not blame you for being a fool, but the people who changed those regulations in your area.
I find it laughable that you think it is about not understanding overhead.

Fuck all the fear, I just bought a Raspberry pi with some bitcoin. Just business as usual.

There are alt coins already created. It seems bitcoin is the 'brand name' crypto currency at the moment, and this seems to make it the most heard of and trusted so far.
If another takes off, good. The invention itself has amazing value. It is the first type of currency that can not be counter fitted and a public ledger that can not be altered. This itself makes it superior to any other currency we have ever used.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:09:35

I was there just the other night and did over $4000 in transactions with no palm scan at all. Not even a mention of the palm scan.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:01:22
My only issue with just printing out the QR code is that I am unsure how to ensure the price.
I would like a service where I can have a cashier enter the price into a machine, or tablet, and have it us the current conversion using the exchange we choose, likely the VirtEx or MtGox, and then have the QR code include the price so that the customer just needs to scan the QR code, confirm the price, and send the payment.
Is there a 3rd party service, or maybe an app that can do this for us? I would also like to be sure that a disgruntled employee couldn't easily walk off with our wallet in the tablet, or transfer the bitcoin to their own wallet.

While you are correct, that they are not the norm, it is the way human memories work that we remember them most. They influence education more than the good teachers because of this.
It is a sad thing, and I wish it wasn't so, but it is. Because of this we need to hold teachers to a standard and be able to more easily fire them. Teachers Unions are a good thing, but in this they are failing the students.

What isn't causing a boom these days? It took off this last time right when both the first ATM, and China got on. Then all the extra media around bitcoin lately, and even businesses using bitcoin as the negotiated payment method for a contract.
It is hard to say if it just a boom, or if it finally catching on. Even all the regulations talks help because it shows the government talking about bitcoin as a currency, which makes it legitimate in many peoples eyes.
@_date: 2013-08-23 08:34:12
So if I buy drugs or if a prostitute solicits sex for Bitcoin will that be considered illegal in Canada? The first may still be argued to be trafficking for free, but the second would be seriously arguable.

That has been good for Canada. We already got our bitcoin ATM. Good for China taking the same direction.

I think the biggest way was through purchases. There was that trip to space bought, and a couple expensive cars. Purchasing assets is the best way, to "sell."
I think most of the people refereed to as millionaires where people who had enough bitcoin, not those who sold it all.

It seems they actually had a bug in their system causing delays. It was fixed I am told, and it should only take minutes now.

Which point are you talking about? I know the laws around prostitution, if that is what you disagree with. I think this might be a serious loop hole for prostitution until Canada recognizes Bitcoin as money.
That said I think prostitution should be legal. Just in case someone think I am saying otherwise.
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:46:03
I love the Bitcoin story, but I just got to mention something.
It is illegal, or I should say against the contract the business owner has with their bank, to have a minimum purchase for debit transactions.
The bank give its customers debit cards saying they are good as cash, and the bank has contracts with the businesses that use debit machines that they will honor the bank card as if it were cash.
This has caused me anger with dollar stores before.
This is at least true in Canada, BC. I am only assuming it is like that in most all places.
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:10:51
I paid with cash, and I used the wallet on my phone. The phone put up a QR picture that the machine scanned quite easily.

That scenario seems quite unlikely. You are saying the person getting paid can deny it was their address, but this is often done automatically with a QR code and leaves no room for error that way.
If a person gives you a public key and you send, you gave it to them. If they gave you the wrong key it is on them.

Even if we are in a bubble we are also at the start of something new. People compare it to the dotcom bubble, and I think that may be the best comparison there is.
The dotcom bubble may have burst, but the internet is still one of the biggest things going today.

I see, thanks for letting me know what the issue was.
I am hoping to work with my schools student counsel to get them to accept bitcoin at our schools student run cafe. Hopefully it will attract more university students to give bitcoin a try. Many seem to just need that little extra push.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:27:38
I just did the same thing last night. It was the first thing I have ever bought with bitcoin. So glad I bought one when the ATM opened here in Vancouver.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:12:49
Hmm, I am new to bitcoin and Raspberry pi. I was thinking of doing this and am glad a post is already up giving info.
Reading has left me unsure and wanting to ask a couple questions.
Can the bitcoin wallet be left on the SD card and removed from the Raspberry Pi and considered safe? What I mean is that I then use the Raspberry Pi for other things with a different SD card, and only insert my wallet SD card when I want it to accept a bitcoin transfer?
Is there a way to transfer bitcoins to a wallet not connected to the net, or kept online?
I keep thinking of paper wallet, but I do not have much trust in that. If all else fails I might do it, but I dislike the idea of a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:23:10
I really doubt it would ever stabilize that low. While the bubbles may make the price move up at an inflated amount, the general trend is upward anyway. I could see it crashing to and stabilizing around $500 - $700 if it crashes. I could see it generally building to around $1000 again before its net big bubble take off.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:12:19
Canada. We got an ATM machine here in Vancouver Canada, and will be opening a second one in our province soon. It is nice and easy to be able to buy and sell bitcoin for cash at an ATM machine.
In its first week it saw over $100K in transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:57:37
Stuff like this makes me wonder why people keep their bitcoin anywhere but on themselves.
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:07:03
No, it is not that one can not pay for sex. That is legal in Canada. What a prostitute can not do in Canada is advertise or solicit sex for money. The discussion about money legally has to happen in private.
So what I am saying is that she could advertise on the web that the prostitute will take Bitcoin for sex, and that if Bitcoin was not legally money then it makes me wonder if it would be illegal.
That loop hole is exploited up here a lot. It allows girls to be escorts that work for themselves without fear of cops arresting them. It makes it hard to advertise her business though. That said there are ways of doing it, and that advertising is the only illegal thing they are doing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:52:36
I just want to be able to spend my bitcoin... I have my student society at my university looking into accepting it at the student cafe at least.

Any day is a good day to buy. If you are looking to make short bucks then do as you wish, but buying any time would be good for long term investment.
That said, don't think of it as an investment necessarily. You do not need to sell the bitcoin back for cash to make a profit. When you find things that will let you buy with bitcoin do so. This way you get actual things at a better rate than trying to convert it back to cash.
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:44:48
That was my point. Prostitution is not illegal in Canada itself, but the advertising or soliciting of sex in exchange for money is. So if a prostitute advertises sex for bitcoin I wonder how the courts would look at it. It would have to go to court to get a real answer I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:42:08
I just do not trust keeping it in any online wallet at all. I currently keep it on my phone, and am making a bitcoin wallet for the Raspberry pi as well.
I obviously keep an encrypted backup of my wallet as well.
People have told em the phone isn't that safe either, which is why I am making that Raspberry Pi wallet for any long term storage, and keeping the phone wallet for transactions.
Kind of like having a safe at home and a wallet on me for spending.

So glad I was able to just drive out to the ATm machine and buy some last night. Man did that make it much easier for me to start out with bitcoin.
I love to look in my wallet and see it there. I can`t wait to see what comes of it soon.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:46:43
In my Province there was a deal between a mining company and the contractors they hired, and the deal payment was done using bitcoin. The deal was to just buy the fiat amount of bitcoin and transfer it at the time of payment, instead of transferring by bank.
Hopefully more businesses batch on to this kind of idea when making contracts for large sums of money.
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:29:57
I guess people can be dumb. What confuses me is that you can see when you have unconfirmed bitcoins coming to your wallet. You do not need them to show you anything.
I don't know if it is just the program I use, but I see my bitcoins coming to me before they are confirmed.
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:33:05
Well prostitution is not a crime in Canada, only soliciting sex for money is a crime, so yes the bitcoin could make a huge difference.
Normally trafficking drugs is done with money as well, but as I said that could still just be called trafficking for free.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:04:55
I think it was fun using that machine. I felt good buying my first bitcoin, and I liked feeling like I was part of something new.
@_date: 2013-10-26 10:32:39
If your margins are that close then you have much bigger issues. I really doubt any law survived or not because they took debit.
The amount of extra business you get from accepting debit was originally meant to offset the costs or transaction fees which are common with banks.
It is ridiculous that instead of having those fees reduced a price can just be put onto the customer.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:56:53
That is the idea with the Raspberry pi.

That is horrible that they changed that. I am glad they have not changed it up here yet. I refuse to buy anything at a store with minimums like that.
Is that for all transactions, or just debit transactions? My main issue is that debit and cash are meant to be equal.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:29:48

I meant in the context that while the dotcom bubble may have burst, the interest in using the internet did not.

Laws against money laundering require the business to know who the customer they are dealing with is.
That said they never asked for info to attach to that palm scan. Also, they choose the palm scan because there is no national records of them.
They are not required to do this yet, but in the US, and when Canada starts to regulate bitcoin, there will be this requirement.

It wasn't that big of a gap actually. I think it is a 3% or a 5% service charge.

Except for putting the hand in the scanner first, that is pretty much it. They do give you the ability to see the current exchange rate it is offering as well.
