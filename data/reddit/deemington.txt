Death threat? I really don't understand what you mean. If you don't like those in power then you can vote for someone else.

In some places more than others.

Because the money to pay for them all come from taxes. Do you think kids would get a good education if the government didn't have any money to hire teachers? Or maybe the free market would solve it all and only kids with rich parents should get an education.

I respect your point of view and you're right that you don't have to well in education to be successful. But everyone should have the same opportunity (as much as is realistically possible). If a kid from a poor family wants to be a doctor or lawyer when he grows up then that should be possible. Also home schooling writes off kids with bad parents. 
Schools in densely populated areas might be really bad but I think that is more to do with the distribution of the taxes rather than the idea of taxation itself. For example spending a massive amount of money on the military and ignoring education.

Yep, here in UK and it was great (by public I mean free to attended and funded by government since 'public school' means something different here). Maybe all the kids that can't afford private education should just work in shitty jobs with no future prospects then?

Be realistic. Infrastructure is not falling apart.

So will you be the one paying for the random pothole in the highway then?

The first article "Real Crypto-Anarchy Without Anonymity" is a very interesting read and idea but it's very speculative. The thought of that actually happening and a few select people having economic control over entire nation's and even global economies is even more worrying and I don't think people would allow it happen.

This sounds perfect for the [Einsteinium Foundation]( to take a look at.
Einsteinium is a cryptocurrency that aims to raise funding for cutting edge scientific research. Check them out, I'm sure they would happy to help out.

Why not just tax tea, paper and sugar again and watch the country's infrastructure fall apart? That would be great!

I never said that I agree with the NY stuff. I said it is a fine balance between consumer protection and decentralization that needs a consensus between governments and the Bitcoin community. If it costs $15 million to comply then obviously that it crazy. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:20:37
I guess you're both trolling or something as I have no clue where all this death threat, bomb stuff came from. If you don't agree, don't vote for them. Simple.

Defense, social security, interests on national debt, transportation, research, educations, law enforcement and I'm sure there's more I haven't mentioned. These things are essential for a society to function and maintain itself.

Volatility is the biggest concern for me, and the volatility is caused by the poor distribution. I think the technology is amazing, it will be successful and hopefully rise but it won't change the world. 
I see stories of how people are paid their wages in BitCoin, or how it could be used as a payment system for people with no access to banks. When you think such as small group of people could just cash out at anytime it's pretty scary. Imagine your bank manager said your money will be safe as long as a few random anonymous people don't say fuck it and buy an island. 
It's not FUD just an honest opinion and to other comments I'm not writing this in reaction to whatever the price is.

Me in my ignorance


I 100% agree with this. This is one reason I'm very interested in 'altcoins' and all the technology around the blockchain. The idea is amazing but Bitcoin's implementation is just too skewed for me. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:37:36
Things like research, education, interest on national debt are not really applicable to the whole of human history. Most large and developed societies had some form of taxation, I can't really think of any that didn't. Maybe small tribal communities that could organise themselves or totalitarian communist states like North Korea who abolished taxes in 1974.

Toll roads would just be like tax but more inconvenient 
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:32:03


I disagree. I for one do not want to see big banks and corporations running wild with Bitcoin at the cost of your average Joe if regulations are not there for them to be held accountable. I'm not saying there should be hoops and costs for any small businesses or consumers, just that there needs to be *some* form of regulation established, that's acceptable to us as the community and the regulators so that everyone can get on with things. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:49:42
Ok well 51% then. Not everyone
@_date: 2014-10-24 01:19:03
Lets just hope they allow it
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:54:20


Agreed. This is a good form of political resistance. I think a lot of the downvotes are coming from people in the US who don't see much hope regarding appropriate regulation. Those who don't care are having to take a risk though. If there were agreed upon guidelines that everyone would happily adhere to then Bitcoin could thrive. All this Lawsky stuff and people's attitudes towards the article suggests to me that the US might not be at the forefront of Bitcoin in years to come. 
 Last line of the article:

Granted in the USA with the amount of lobbying etc. the government is not ideal but its better than "everyone for themselves". If you look at some countries in Europe you might see how the government works for the people more than corporations. The problem is therefore not with the idea of taxes but more with the state of politics.

I think they're right in that ATMs will have to be open-source in order to compete
