You think the demonization of child porn in recent years is for children? 
They picked the easiest hard line to push. Sexual, deviant, children. Who would go out there and defend people accused of that? Too bad the evidence is easier to plant than cocaine on a dead body.

Should make a graph about how much it cost to transact in each currency, what is the risk of theft of each currency, etc.  
By market cap, bitcoin is shit next to all world currency, petrol, gold, steel, wheat, etc.

Why not just buy a old processor instead? 
@_date: 2016-12-06 04:20:15
Do you expect that those crowd funded processor will have anywhere near the performance of a pentium 4?

I thought mining was making bitcoin decentralized. Is that going to change?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:57:28
Or when it crashes there will be no more reason to "invest" in bitcoin.

False until it attracts more mining power, then bitcoin1MB will become the 'false coin'.

You don't need the difference in market cap to manipulate the market. Most people will get out of Bitcoin when words spread out that it's not going to the moon anymore.

He might want to both dump btc for bcc and also manipulate the value of BCC in one swing to bring it more valuable than BTC. After a few months with BCC &gt; BTC in value, it will only be a matter of time before the BCC chain has more PoW in it to become BTC.

The guy complains about a party seeking profit at the cost of what's best for the community. Bitcoin is the ultimate libertarian currency, who argues that the system will work best as everyone act in their own self interests without regulation. 
The person sees this belief crumble.

They adopted online banking before HTTPS was a thing. They built their security infrastructure from scratch and enacted laws arround it. They stuck with it. 
Korea in the tech sector is extremely good in electronics but horrible in software. Horrible.  
Just go on  and see for yourself. That website is the "korean" google.

That soap taste is when you start to realise that the system (bitcoin) allows this to happen by design, and that you slowly realise that bitcoin will go nowhere... but you believed, you believed so hard...
@_date: 2017-04-26 19:09:21
This is Korea. The internet security is SHIT here. Literally, most financial website are not using https, but instead opt to ask you to install some random security software as soon as you land on their page. Same for every update, ask again to install. This is just on the surface, but it seems to be fairly easy to spoof a website and ask the user to install your virus. The user won't blink twice before giving privileged access to the virus as it's everyday routine. 
It's so bad that I dedicated a old computer to do all the online shopping and banking, and I assume all the passwords and the computer itself is compromised. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:00:16
Don't they complain the same about bitcoin core?
@_date: 2017-04-26 19:03:20
I guess all those security software did not help them! 
@_date: 2017-04-27 07:51:29
IE and ActiveX are mandatory. All the website have a seperate English website that wasn't tested. Almost all Korean have a 3 syllable name 박근혜 for example. Lousy programmer will therefore just program expecting 3 character. Sucks if your name is longer than that. Also no space... or space is supported... sometime family name after, sometime before... sometime in hangeul... sometime in alphabet... eg:lawrencejennifer, jennifer lawrence, 제니퍼러레스, 러레스제니퍼, etc (about 10 possible combination). 
Everytime I have to do anything, I can be expected to run into 1-2 crash and 1-2 "update or new software install", and the yearly occasional "change your password". By the way, each time one of those happen, they make you restart the whole process from the login page. Most of the time they tell you only after you spent 10 minutes filling some information or adding things in your shopping cart. Of course the website does not remember any of the information you entered, type again. 
I fucking hate it.
On the other hand, physical credit card is a charm to use and is accepted practically everywhere. I tap my credit card for public transport, taxi, $0.50 convenience store purchase, etc. They never ask for any password or actual signature (you sometime have to sign some scrible in the terminal, the staff usually do it for you).

It's not because he doesn't have a solution that he is wrong saying there is a design flaw.

Never believe someone that says that something will always be safe. 
The guy is implying brute forcing, but there are already multiple other techniques to break all kinds of encryption. To imply that no new and better ones will come is just naive. 
Who knows if one day, someone come up with a method to compute the private key from the public key (even with QC).
Just in this thread, in 2016, many people explain how the problem is actually by a HUUUUUGE order of magnitude simpler to solve then 2^256.

Bitcoin without segwit has the same PoW as bitcoin with larger blocksize. Segwit actually changes the PoW, not bcc. 
It is also pretty clear that in the bitcoin protocol description, the chain with the most amount of work is the one true chain.

Do they have the mining power to fork? If they do, why does the current branch remain?
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:04:06
If they have more mining power, than it means they are not an alt coin, they are bitcoin.

At first the bank did not have fractional reserves. Eventually they realised that their 'cold storage' never got lower than X amount. Some guy did the math, and they realised that if they lend that X amount, they would make some Y amount in profit.
