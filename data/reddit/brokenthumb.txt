Cool thanks for the reply! One more quick question - let's say I netted 10k from cashing out btc and paid 2k in taxes and had 8k left to buy more btc. Let's say I cashed those btc later for 10k net gain (18k) again because btc went up - do I have to pay another 2k in taxes on those btc? Is double taxation something else?

Let's say I bought 10 btc at $100 apiece, cashed them out at $1,000 apiece so I made a $9,000 net gain essentially, then rebought btc at like $500 apiece so I ended up with 0 cash net gain but now possess 20 btc. Am I correct to assume that I was supposed to pay taxes on the $9000 before I used the money to 'reinvest' in more bitcoins?
Also if someone wanted to stay off the SAR list could they just deal in btc transactions in $1000 increments?

for future reference you can combine flags in one dash
    grep -ir bitcoin .
    
i usually throw in an `n` flag as well for line number

As soon as you can buy them on bitfloor.
Once you do the deposit at BofA it's literally maybe 30 minutes tops usually only 10-15 before you see the cash in your bitfloor account.
From there it's only moments before you can buy your bitcoins!

Just got verified the other day. But fortunately it was only maybe 10,000 in the queue. Also I used bitfloor in the meantime to buy in around $70 per btc so now i have many more coin to spend!
Screw Mt. Gox now that I've got it I don't even need it anymore.

Have you guys considered using cloud computing resources like aws? I know Netflix and countless other big companies use it instead of investing in their own servers or data centers.

Ok - how does it generate new addresses from transactions - do you mean like a log of where i sent or received bitcoins to/from?
i did a small test and my old wallet file seemed to sync up fine and just wanted to make sure it wasn't necessary to make new backups after every transaction. after all, can't transactions be made with paper wallets without the wallets ever being opened as long as its address is used appropriately? i suppose i'm just wondering out loud/trying to answer my own question.

Yeah this guy named Freddy from coinbase usually scans this sub to answer questions he sees.
Coinbase is still pretty wonky. They have a blog or twitter that announces updates though on such cases as they've become common. The missing balance is probably a bug in display and hopefully will get fixed soon enough. At least that's what the coinbase guys say.

Just wait it out bruh these things happen.
Not sure about transaction fees I use multibit and there's an option for how much of a fee you want to add for each transaction, look up the documentation for whatever site or program you're using.
