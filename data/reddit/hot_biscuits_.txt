"living his life"?
Did you mean, "transferring money through the banks systems"?

You are totally delusional

It is impossible. If BTC were to rise 11% the lender would then lose money. Interest rates would need to be ridiculously high and there is no way to enforce repayments.

It seems quite obvious does it?
First off, that has absolutely *nothing* to do with what I said. Sure why wouldn't it? A coin at 100,000 is fundamentally no different to one at 1000. Why would the market suddenly say oh cool lets not be volatile anymore because it hits 100k? Maybe its not 10%, but the USD value of the volatility will be INSANE. No one, ever, is going to lend in that kind of environment

This is already a risk, and in the event of it occurring the bank has the power to deny withdrawals. There is absolutely no difference.

A) The point I made is that bitcoin will NEVER stabilize, it makes no sense for it to do so.
B) No, the price of bitcoin is not accurately predictable, so if there is ever an unexpected rise of value in BTC a lender will lose an amount of money equal to the rise in value. As a result of the unpredictability of bitcoin it is impossible to attempt to hedge the  gains on BTC value with an interest rate.
