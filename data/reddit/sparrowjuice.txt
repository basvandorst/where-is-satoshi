There is starting to be some misinformation in this thread.  Assuming you didn't send a Replace By Fee (RBF transaction) the first thing you might want to try is a Child Pays for Parent transaction.  Spend some of the Bitcoin in the transaction with a higher fee, and many miners will confirm you original transaction (parent) in order to get the fee from the child.

No they are not lost.  They will return to your wallet after a couple weeks. (of course,  someone can rebroadcast the transactions, but...).  There are things you can do to speed it up, as will probably be explained here. If not, I may take the time to do it, or you can google it.

Keep in mind that the blockchain is the only authoritative ledger.  This is where your "balance" is, or more accurately, where all transactions are. The balance associated with an address can be calculated from these transactions. Unconfirmed transactions are kept in the mempool.  As other commenter mentioned, you can use a Blockchain Explorer to view both of these transactions and the "balance" (total of any unspent coins) of each address.  
Your wallet app holds the private keys of these addresses. The private keys can be used to sign transactions to send the associated bitcoin to other addresses.  The wallet software syncs up with servers to display your balance, but, again, this is not authoritative.  If wallet software (or the servers they are connecting to)  mess up and give you an incorrect balance that doesn't change the blockchain, and therefore doesn't change the state of your bitcoins.  
The only way to irretrievably lose your bitcoins is to either lose the private keys or send the bitcoin to an address outside your control.

Ignore him. You can't delete the transaction from the mempool.
