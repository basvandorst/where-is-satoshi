This is a statist circlejerk. They are so used to having and wanting a monopoly for everything. They fear competition because with competition comes a possibility of failure. Or the possibility that things can and should be decentralized including crypto.
 'There can only be one.'

Just another thing off the list. Post office is almost done. Education is coming along nicely. Once you get rid of a few things from government control and do them better. Other things become easier.

Your arguements here are reactionary, not preventative. Both the police and the FDIC in these cases are there to react after the fact so having them in no way "prevents" the crime from happening in the first place. Sure for some people the threat of consequences is enough to deter but for most people things are risk/reward based + personally morality (often taught by parents not the state), determines the rules people choose to follow. Pot has been illegal for almost a century now, that hasn't stopped anyone from getting high.

Spot price really does depend on the spot you currently occupy. Meaning what ever is available and the price someone is willing to give it for is the spot price.

If you need pricing information to determine a price I use bitcoinwisdom.com . If you are looking to enter the market where you live really matters. The laws or perception of the laws in your home country, determine the barriers to entry. (When things were early it was actually much easier than it is now.) Until banks can figure out how to profit from bitcoin first, they have put up barriers. As far as trading crypto goes there is a few choices. Some of the top choices being BTC-e.com, cryptsy.com, vaultofsatoshi.com, and many others. Once you have cash into the crypto market, moving coins from site to site and place to place is extremely simple, with very low or even no barriers. When you want to exit, honestly the top option is to spend the coins. There is an ever growing number of businesses accepting crypto's like bitcoin and litecoin. Exiting this way is by far the cheapest way and povides the most "perks", many websites will offer a discount to get your bitcoin business. 
The most important thing to do is learn about the security you will need to store the coins **under your own control**. If you only use windows. Install virtualbox and play with installing a linux distro. Check and if you need help.
**DO NOT TREAT THE EXCHANGE LIKE A BANK!!! ONLY LEAVE WHAT YOU INTEND TO TRADE OR CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!!!**
I can't say that strongly enough. You are in the end responsible in this new system. Make your decisions accordingly. There are no babysitters around here.

I don't remeber using the word will. Can doesn't equal will. In computers there is a drive to make things simpler. Think of the original computers the size of a building are now basically on a chip with no moving parts just simpler on/off switches not more complex. Think of hardrives very complex at first with tons of moving parts modern SSD's are far simpler with no moving parts. Each part of the computer while being able to do more complex things are trending toward more simpler designs and components. 
With regards to weapons of war. The first repeating guns were really complex and were prone to failure. The most successful options were the ones that did more complex things with less moving parts. 
As far as the tanks go they cost a shit load to maintain. Without that masive expense they would break down pretty quick and still break down. The US military or the US government in general rarely advertise their failures.

Yeah tons of short term accounts. With that being the only post. Let's see some actual proof.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:16:26
Unless they feel strongly about it. Which means the vote and opinion then has value.

Leave the country!!
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:55:38
That remains to be seen. Millions got screwed over and still don't have jobs. Next time around you may own some bank stock. Sounds exciting!!
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:36:36
So they will steal your valuable property and replace it with an inferior product. Sounds like theft to me. Since they decide on what is valid or not and the price of sale.
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:45:32
When they eventually screw us over can they please use lube? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:05:45
And the co-opting of bitcoin continues.

Nice no invasive penis scanner like the competition.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:09:44
And "taxes".  Without making things to complex: It is like a relay race where the baton is "taxes" and it gets 10% (usually much more) heavier (expensive) with every person it is handed off to. The more people involved to make a product, the heavier the "tax" burden becomes and the greater percentage of the overall cost is actually taxes. There is a compounding affect, because taxes are usually passed to the customer.

So Hitler had a bias as well. So do many other groups who had a bias for seeing another group dead. Like America has a bias for only bombing muslim countries (lately anyway). They switch it up every decade or so.

Check out  they will give more coverage in the international market and why limit yourself to just one crypto? In the end if your boss decides to keep some crypto he can choose from a few or just keep the bitcoin and process through the alts. It doesn't make sense to impose limits this early.

The romans created the modern highway system to better move troops. Increased trade was really only a side affect to assisting invasions and repelling invaders.
Edit. Its important to note. That with all the extra ability to lash out and fight and increased trade that Rome had. It still collapsed because it couldn't pay its bills. Because the "Empire" lived beyond its means.
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:46:09
This is the theory with no proof it can work without causing major problems. One thing it will do for sure is make the system FAR more complicated than it is today. Anything more complicated has more opportunity for serious bugs to be "created".

You realize centralize governments, dictatorships and religious extremeists like all cults (including christianity/Islam) require these fiat currencies to maintain their stranglehold on people. Without monetary control they crumble because they lose the ability to control and bribe the population.  Taxes collected on that coffee are used to kill people all over the place even within some countries where the taxes are collected.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:21:40

Maybe you should give it a try while timing it. Then you won't have to think it is or isn't you will know for sure. It should be about ten mins if it exceeds 1-2 outside then then it is strange. I have timed a few and they have taken up to 30 mins.

According to you. If you don't like it wait until an option that you like comes along. Or until there is a government sanctioned option that you like. The beauty of these current options is you don't have to participate if you don't feel comfortable. No one is forcing you or anyone else.

You should do it by not leaving your coins on the exchange. It's already been said dozens of times exchanges are not banks.

The whole point of bitcoin is to get the government out of peoples pockets and personal lives. Who cares what these people did with their money? It has absolutely nothing to do with you or anyone else. Why does the government have to be involved in every transaction a person does in their lives?

So doge has come out to claim the statist coin title. Next step will have to be remote seizure or better known as remote theft capability, as a feature, every transaction will be pre-taxed .  Good for them,  we have someplace to point the statists. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:05:48
I think it is hyperbole to suggest that regulation or giving the blockchain over to governments will improve it.

This sounds like a great opportuniy.
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:02:50
Another thing that needs to be mentioned. Is that a deflationary currency encourages better products not disposable products. When gold was the standard products lasted for decades (farm equipment) if not centuries (houses).

People who think bitcoin can fit everything are crazy. We need many competing currencies and blockchains. In the end one may be better for one thing and another for something else. At this point a singular one world currency does not make sense. Multiple unregulated currencies does make sense.

If you want to play the regulation game making sure you can't accept an illegal transaction is just part of it. Don't game the system to take advantage of accidents. Keeping in mind recieving and transmitting (returning an illegal transaction) are both illegal. The smart company would protect themselves if they are playing the regulate everyone game.

The idea that the world is better through extortion, torture and murder. And the hate of other nations and ideologies promoted by Nationalism has already crossed the line over into the territory of ideologies like Racism.

Have you ever thought about how much "tax" is in each product you use? It's insane! Each level of production adds another layer of compounding "taxes". For anything complex with multiple stages and parties involved it is crazy. I haven't done the actual numbers. But think of it like this:
Without making things to complex: It is like a relay race where the baton is "taxes" and it gets 10% (usually much more) heavier (expensive) with every person it is handed off to. The more people involved to make a product, the heavier the "tax" burden becomes and the greater percentage of the overall cost is actually taxes.

We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.

They aren't designed to be minimally compliant since there is no requirements for bio metrics or ID scanning in any ATM. There are currently no separate rules for bitcoin that go beyond what any other ATM operator would have to do. They are more likely designed to be forward compliant where they assumed governments will eventually want it. As far as I know only robocoin has gone to these extents of information collection.  The other manufacturers have not bothered to be so intrusive. Again I'm not here for an arguement. I appreciate that people are putting up the money and effort to get machines out there.

Or is this just the vocal minority again?  The market wants comcast to cut the price in half. Let's see how well that works

Why do they even allow or offer a deposit address to someone they haven't confirmed as being able to use their service? To me this is nothing more than a scam.

Trading provides liquidity and involves risk. There is nothing wrong with it and attempting to make a profit at it isn't wrong. This isn't s socialized system like Wall Street where losses are socialized and profits are privatized. There are no bail outs in Bitcoin, at least not in its current form.

Compared to competitors the fees are huge (over three times the fees).  The industry average is 0.5% or less (of course the current fiat system has justified much higher fess for reasons that don't apply to bitcoin). Any exchange with decent volume crushes Cavirtex on the fees. For a global currency with no borders any trader who wants to provide liquidity will take the coins anywhere other than Cavirtex. That's why places like BTC-e and nearly any other major exchange does Cavirtex's level of trade for 6-12 months everyday.  That translates into major profit that Cavirtex should want a piece of to make the shareholders they didn't screw over happy.

I believe this is a scam on CaVirtex's side. Why even bother offering a deposit address to someone you haven't verified yet? This is a way for them to steal  from people and pretend it is them doing due diligence. This sounds like the banks game of creating a captive audience. Then combine with the inactivity fees they charge.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:28:39
The best estimates are that the black market is at least $1.8trillion a year. I personally think these estimates are really low because they don't inlcude institutional crime committed by massive global banks and governments off the books.
 
There is a massive demand for electronic currencies that can't be seized at the borders. The cartels don't care about losing the drugs, but they hate to lose the money. If they don't have to put the money in danger, that is huge savings.

But if they want to get serious about it drop the fees.

But many people believe preaching pro-government rhetoric is aggressive, exclusive and polarizing as well. Being pro-govenment these days tend to have a conotation that pro-privacy is not compatable with. Because there is always some excuse to by pass privacy with the current pro-government rhetoric. There is a cult like belief that there is some group of people, who better know who deserves privacy and who does not, as well as who gets to access that private information, that is collect by force.

If you threaten to lock your neighbor in a cage in your basement for not giving you a cut of everything they make then you are accused of extortion (at the least). But for them it's different. Record everything your neighbor does and attach a GPS device and you are a stalker. They do it and it's for your own good and they don't need to explain why because national security.  The list of double standards is huge. And the list of people trained to ignore these double standards is huge as well.

Exactly they need a reason to keep up the largest per capita incarceration rate of any place on the planet, including all the "bad places". It also provides a ton of income. Have you noticed the trend is to hide and capitalize on the fines vs being visible and actually lowering crimes. They are constantly trying to justify their worth by showing things in as a horrible light as possible. We have police now lobbying government to create laws that increase their ability to stay in a job. It is a major conflict of interest.

For instance ASICMiner alone adds about $100million. Just Havelock.com Has about 38000BTC in assests. Not to mention all the other exchanges and alt coins that are priced in BTC. The Bitcion market already far exceeds the $1.2billion "market cap". So does anyone have the time or inclination to find us a more reasonable "market cap" for bitcoin?

The biggest thing that alt coins have going for them is that cash is completely unsuitable as a means of arbitrage, it just isnt fast enough to provide the liquidity that the crypto sector needs. And many of the people who hold bitcoins do not want fiat at all, they are more likely to trade for another crypto coin though.

This is the way to do insurance.  Think about it, incredibly low fees and the pool value grows exponentially over time. You could theoretically have a policy that has a point in time where fees are no longer required but coverage becomes permanent. Now apply that to a healthcare pool or an education fund. Deflationary currencies have some interesting potential benefits for a society.

Then stop trying to put a positive spin on it that minimizes the fact that he really isn't a criminal who belongs in a cage. I don't know if you have ever had the experience of being locked in a cage or being placed in solitary confinement. But pretending it's something trivial doesn't do the situation justice. Give up your freedom for what may be decades and see if you feel at times like your being tortured. Fun fact there is more incidents of male on male rape than male on female rape and the vast majority of those rapes happen in prison.

Same thing goes for currency, if we want free interaction we need choices and competition we need plan b and plan c. Though bitcoins nature makes it hard to tame, having competing currencies just helps to keep everyone honest. Another thing if we want to see stable prices across exchanges we need another coin to arbitrage with, the leader for that thus far is litecoin. I think competing cryptos strengthen bitcoin since most of the other coins tend to be back by there ability to be converted to and from bitcoin. Just the fact that people are buying and trading them gives them legitimacy. Only time will tell who the winners and scammers are. It's been a great ride thus far.

I understand the enthusiasm with democracy but the idea that,  
"A Democracy means we all count. A democracy means we are free. We have free speech and we have freedom to try different currencies. We are free to pursue kumquats or bitcoins. Or happiness.", is not totally correct (Not even close actually). In many instances it means that your countrymen are free to impose restrictions on you. It also means, as we have seen, that the people who are voted in to political standing will typically do what they want and not what you want. Thanks to the democratic process your free speech is being taken away slowly but surely.

That's a matter of opinion held by a VERY small percentage of the worlds population. Personally if the US government doesn't want their citizens doing business with a foreign company,  then the US government should arrest their citizens (who are the actual criminals) not go after a company that is not bound by US law. The citizens are bound by that law not the foreign entity. This is just another example of America trying to be the world police while protecting the bankers who own the country (and think they own the world).

I hate when people consider 50%+ as a majority when it comes to legislature. Personally if something is important enough to make it law there should be at least 75%+ consensus. People can say nothing will get done that way,  but i don't agree instead of all the crap getting through only the most important things will come up. Most of the fluff wont even come up because of the sheer volume of support required to get something passed.

Those communities created and built bitcoin and crypto in general to be what it is today. Bitcoin is like the crown jewel that proves that those ideals have merit and those communities don't want it to be co-opted even if it means it takes longer for adoption.

Plea bargains are more along the line of "Hey do you want Bubba raping you for 20 years? Or 5 years? Because if you make me work for it I'm gonna make you pay." Since no one except for the most wealthy have even a hope in hell at mounting a defence against the government. So people give up because they know they can't win. That's not a conviction that's a railroading. It's not even close to being called justice. Here's a fun little fact. There is more male on male rape, than male on female rape, and those rapes tend to happen to non-violent people in prison. So the government may have you raped for your "crimes". Just in case you didn't know. Or they can just water board you for your passphrase.

Bitcoin makes taxes pretty much impossible to enforce. They become something that people have to choose to be involved in. This makes the next logical step that governments have to provide services people want and are willing to pay for. Instead of our current one size fits all model. The real question is can governments handle some competition from the decentralize everything crowd or will they pull out the guns? Look at Obamacare apparently only like 100k people actually wanted it, because thats all that have signed up so far,and some 5 million plus people have actively opted out.

I don't think they are apathetic so much as they don't have an option in the current one party system (two if you see red and blue as separate parties) that is supposed to 'represent' them, so they see government as a waste of time and a burden.

Sure if everything is as cut and dry as murder.  Let's try someone here visiting from a country where the concept of jwalking is unknown. How would that person know they have committed a crime unless they knew before hand? According to  your example that person is a criminal. Now instead of a fine we took jwalking really seriously and attached a penalty of say 10 years in a cage for getting caught. Does your example still make sense then? After all this person should of known better.  Or here's a crazy real world example in some countries it's against the law to be raped the victim is in the wrong.

This is the way to think about it.  With traditional money we are taught to think in inflationary ways.  Which is get max value now because the money will be worth less later.

You make the assumption that the other 7 billion people on the planet cares as much about your dying as you do. If your government collapses and people die it will be directly because your government dismantled the infrastructure that allowed society to go on without it. Because they made people so dependant.

Seized from someone who hasn't been convicted of a crime is theft. Like all these people who take out say $10k from there account to go buy a vehicle and get pulled over along the way and have their money "seized" without any reason other than it was suspicious. 
It is likely they will never convict him of a crime. They will try and use extortion/bribery on him ie plead guilty and get 2 years or make the prosecutor "work" for it and get 10 years. Since only the wealthiest of people can afford to fight the charges most people just give up because they CAN'T win no matter what they do. 
Backing someone into a corner and threatening to lock them in a cage like an animal unless they admit to doing what they are accused of is wrong. Its the same tactic that lead to so many deaths of "alleged" witches.

Cash doesnt travel the same way bitcoins do. If you want to arbitrage there is a cost for moving the cash around. The differences usually are based on how hard it is to get cash in and out and from one place to another and the fees associated with each third party in the process.

I agree they probably offered to limited the torture too maybe a decade instead of a couple decades.  Extortion/plea bargains are used to avoid having to get actually convictions. The vast majority of people can not afford to fight the government in court especially when they have the NSA to snoop your entire defence or to toss out a national security letter. Those kinds of tactics make the justice system a farce. All he did was provide a safe place for people to conduct trade amongst each other.
