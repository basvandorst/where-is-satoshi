Like any other big corporation, they will join Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and develop on the public Ethereum blockchain. He did not say anything about payments, but "puts more power in people's hands".

It is centralized copy (bad copy) of **Ethereum** virtual machine, if Ethereum sucks so much why do you want to copy it on your lovely bitcoin chain ?

The new plan (SW) does NOT matter, because it will take something around 1 year to implement. The problem is that the blocks are already full and bitcoin can not handle more transaction per second and that is huge problem if we want bitcoin to success as global payment network. So if we do not increase the block size now bitcoin will stay crippled for another year and who knows if not longer. And even if SW gets implemented sooner it is still not a long term solution because it makes bitcoin only a little more efficient and that is ridiculous if we want bitcoin to go mainstream. Another problem is that the global bank blockchain should be operating within a year so bitcoin will be almost useless as global payment network.

Why the question mark ? Looks like you are not sure. The truth IS that any negative post about Bitcoin gets deleted on this subreddit. This subreddit is pure bitcoin propaganda.

Because decentralization is the way to go. Centralized systems will hardly compete with decentralized ones, especially in situations like 3rd world war, catastrophic financial crisis etc... and they know that very well. There are only two options they can do in this super fast changing enviroment (thanks to technologies), 1. they will not adapt to the new enviroment and therefore lose their power or 2. they can change and adapt. 
Just look at our history, the governments did everything that was possible to retain power and gain even more. Any government that works/worked opposite way is not prospering is loosing power and just lagging behind the "strong" ones and can be easily under control of the strong/highly functional ones.
Think about this, they can print endless amout of money that can be used to influence for free! a lot of parts of blockchain ecosystem like making ASICs, free energy/mining, buying bitcoin, paying developers, media and so much more. If they made bitcoin they probably control the 2 milions bitcoin that can also be used as a "bomb" in situation if someone else will take control of bitcoin.

Satoshi Nakamoto is just fiction/fabrication a nice fairytale for pople that want to see ideals (it is human nature). I would not be surprised if some goverment or company was behind bitcoin. But I am sure this comment will be downvoted, logic is strictly not alowed here.
