I don't think private enterprise can provide for all services in society (which is why I'm anarchist and not Libertarian), and I distrust corporations almost as much as governments, many have a history of clearly working against our interests as citizens and consumers. 
The anarchist ideal that I like is for growing decentralisation and communal non-hierarchical organisation (sort of like the Culture depicted by Iain Banks). This requires technological and social advances such as cryptocurrencies and decentralised production (3D printing and such). 
We are not there yet, so regulation of some sort is the lesser evil at the moment to ensure our safety.

If that was correct, no company would ever do anything wrong because self-interest would stop them. In reality, private companies are guilty of anything from labour abuses to environmental damage. History is filled with examples of companies selling sub-standard products, abusing customers and abusing employee.   the idea that somehow self-interest always prevails does not respond to reality.

I'm an anarchist, but I think that at the moment some degree of regulation is useful. I don't like getting robbed, I like safe roads, and I do not like getting poisoned when I eat out. I hope that the need for such regulations will eventually diminish and hopefully disappear. 
Having said that, US seizure laws are completely crazy and over the top, I live in the UK and we don't have anything like that.

I am an anarchist but also a pragmatist, some of the models that I favour require structures that are not yet in place, which is why I am not against regulation for the time being. 
The proof of the need for regulation at the moment is that whenever a government falls there is instant chaos, such examples abound in recent history: Libya, Afghanistan, parts of Syria, Yemen, Somalia... not nice places to go to. Plenty of guns, no government, lots of utter chaos. 
Ideally the evolution towards anarchy will be bottom-up, as tools are developed that erode the need for government. On the meantime I'm happy to pay my taxes as I get health insurance, police, roads, infrastructure and even disaster relief when things go haywire.

11 years, and you guys are still creaming your pants by one lonely taxi driver in Thailand accepting bitcoin. Mass adoption is just around the corner guys! 
When will you learn that HODL and currency use are incompatible? Either it's a store of value, or it's a currency, it can't be both.

REALITY CHECK: Bitcoin is at $15.7 right now, with latest orders at $13.6.
This is what happens when people who don't understand economics jump on bandwagons.

The variation is such at the moment that there is too much risk, particularly for a startup. Wait until the exchange rate becomes stable.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:11:16
I'm talking about real confidence. Bitcoin was already small, and surviving mostly on speculation. I cannot see anyone getting into bitcoins at the moment if the confidence in the exchanges is no longer there. 
At the most, value will plummet, and some people will have lost lots of money.

Is Bitcoin legal?  . you should read this before investing

With the MyBitcoin debacle, how can anyone trust derivatives?
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:10:12
I agree with what you said, and have no dog in the fight either.  However, BTC can only grow if more people adopt it to exchange goods and services. The crack to the exchange will play badly in the media, which translates to fewer merchants adopting it, so the BTC remains a speculative market and not a currency. 
This is good for speculation, bad for BTC in the long run. I would not recommend a merchant to take BTCs now.

"Being a Libertarian..."
There's your problem right there.
@_date: 2011-08-03 15:55:05
Because derivatives require trust, and there is little of that at the moment. Bitomat and MyBitcoin are just the latest in a seemingly long line of confidence issues with those involved with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:56:53
It is too early to tell for sure, but this is bad. I cannot see how anyone will have any confidence in the system if the largest exchange got hacked so easily. 
So, you move to another exchange, but can you trust that your money is safe?
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:58:35
After the news today, who is going to trust derivatives in this thing?
@_date: 2011-08-01 21:24:05
Mt.gox hack, 25k BTC theft, the Dwolla charge back debacle, wallet vulnerability, MyBitcoin disappears, Bitomat "loses" 17k BTC (at least). 
Yes, Bitcoin cannot fail.

Oh dear lord, derivatives arrive to Bitcoin, abandon ship, abandon ship!
I feel like I'm reading "For The Win" again.
@_date: 2011-08-06 16:20:21
Because there is a limited marketplace for BTC, and most people don't know about it. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:27:25
The point I am trying to make is precisely that many in the mainstream are castigated right here for not understanding Bitcoin (read any of the Colbert Report threads).

Adding decimal places is de facto inflation, why BTC proponents can't see this is beyond me. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:59:18
This indifferent attitude towards hoarding and lost coins is one of the main reasons why I think that Bitcoin is doomed to fail in the long run. Adding more decimal points is a valid mathematical answer, but it is a ploy. People like round numbers, and your average joe does not work well with large decimal points, it needlessly complicates things. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 10:30:40
That is a big problem with Bitcoin. For it to be successful it needs to be simple, people do not have the time and/or inclination to spend hours learning about cryptography, or to understand what is a blockchain. 
I keep seeing complaints like these in this subreddit. The problem is that it makes BTC look like something only obsessives will understand. This is why adoption is still so low. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:23:13
The same applies at today's prices, and the basic premise has not changed one bit.
