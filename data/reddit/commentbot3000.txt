So he is allowed to use his position as a valued member of the community to advertise the stuff he is selling? I don't see that as a good thing.

Are we really going to allow people to blatantly advertise in this subreddit? I don't see anything in the sidebar specifically disallowing it. But I do see "no referral links" and more importantly "no begging", which I think this is dangerously close to. There's thousands of things for sale on Bitmit, they don't all need their own submission.

I'm admittedly new to the community. But I joined to learn about Bitcoin, crypto in general, and maybe dip my feet into owning some. But this post has none of that, it's just some guy trying to sell me his novelty radio. If your community is ok with that, I think I should find a different community.

Might be nice to cite the person you are quoting in that graphic. I think he gives a much more clear layman explanation also.
Edit: That quote *was* in the top answer on that thread. It's no longer the top answer and I don't know how to link to the individual responses. Anyway, just scroll down a little.

Nope, don't like those either. It seems like you guys are cool with using your subreddit as a platform for free advertising, so I'll just unsubscribe. Good luck with your currency.

He did personally take a percentage of every sale of cyanide and meth however, which the creator of craigslist did not do when you sold your car. So I don't think this is a very accurate comparison.

All correct, however I don't think wget is included in OSX out of the box. Here's how to get it:
Edit: Also, pyquery won't install unless you have Xcode and install the Command Line Tools.
