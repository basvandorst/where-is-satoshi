Crystal ball I got from my grandpa clearly shows 35,250 on Feb 6th. However reverse crab formation on my charts projects the price to only reach 34,059 by then. So I'm a little bit confused.

It can be spoofing. Putting large quantities on one side of the market causing it to move and in the same time putting small orders on the other side of the market. Then repeating this process on the other side for low risk profit.
Its banned on traditional financial markets.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:46:02
I agree somewhat. But I believe in broader context it can change people perception on saving and value. Maybe people who own BTC instead of fiat would prefer to wait and accumulate for something more expensive/better/of higher quality instead of wasting money on cheap things that quickly land in trash. This way the level of spending may remain the same but the quality of spending may improve. So less trash items on the market and higher demand for quality products.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:28:43
Yeah, but if executed correctly can be very profitable. And crypto markets are very immature, easy to manipulate so risk is even lower.
Spoofing still seems to be present on commodity markets:

* There is a potential maximum of 21,000,000 coins in circulation. That's it. Like land, gold or helium, it's a limited resource with ever increasing demand. With all this
I don't think its an issue. This will make BTC owner to think twice before doing a shopping. Because of deflationary nature it would be not wise to spend BTC unless you buy something you REALLY need. So, from the point of household micro economy spending efficiency would increase as people would be less inclined to waste money on things they don't need.
On of the issues you don't mention is BTC's limited divisibility (8 decimals only). It could be added to the point 1).

I can understand you. I joined when bitcoin was @ 5800 USD and daily volume around 1 billion. And loved it instantly. Transactions were very fast and fees much lower. Now I feel the same with ETH which is waaay faster than BTC. But I believe BTC will improve and the fun will be back. That's why I'm hodling and not exchanging.
I hope they quickly fix this issue and you will have a lot of fun with your holding.

"Doesn't affect the number of USD" true
"or what you can buy with one USD." - not true, you can buy much more for 1 USD in Venezuela
Let's continue with your example - maybe I wasn't clear enough.
Let say FX rate is 1USD = 2 Bolivars and after hyperinflation FX rate increased to 1USD = 10 Bolivars. USD value (in US) is still the same as supply of USD remained stable.
But US Government agreed on adopting Bolivars as 2nd currency on US territory. Still the FX rate is the same, right? But currency available for buying on US territory changed. Now you can buy with USD or Bolivars. This is what I mean by increase in supply of currency. You have two currencies to chose from.
And now I can imagine someone from Europe visiting NYC and going shopping with either USD or Bolivars. So he don't need to buy USD, he can go and exchange his Euro for Bolivars. And because of this USD can lose some value in favor for Bolivars (USD/EUR fx rate unchanged but BLR\EUR fx changed due to demand from europe).
This is what i meant by increase in supply by creating Bitcoin 2.0.

It means that the price of coins increases (given the supply, quantity of coins on the market is stable). This is result of increased demand for coins (so there are more people with cash that are willing to invest in it).

But there is now alternative for someone who wants to play with colorful bricks. He doesn't need to buy Lego, he can buy Duplos instead. And someone who already owns Lego and got bored with it and decided to convert back his Lego to USD can have a harder time finding potential buyer because many of them went with the alternative bricks. In the results he would need to lower the price for his bricks.
So the supply of Lego didn't change. But the supply of colorful bricks (that serves the same purpose for its user) increased.
The more I read about bitcoin, the more it resembles me of stocks (shares) than a currency.

So what was the reason to ascribe value to 1.0 network first?
I'm new to crypto so probably I'm missing something (if you can recommend good reading - i'd appreciate). But it seems that the value in Bitcoin lies in the fact, that it is the medium of anonymous storage/transfer. And if another bitcoin network offers the same - what's the point in sticking to one Bitcoin. And if another network offered even better features - I'd expect people transferring from Bitcoin to the new one, for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:47:22
Possibility of spending BTC could be 'a stamp of quality', a proof of recognising BTC as a viable store of value. It would also give it a flexbility - an edge over competing bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:06:27
Actually Bitcoin aspires to be new currency and storage of value. And Buffett knows everything about these two.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:09:57
Not exactly.
In case of dollars people want them because its the only allowed by the government medium of exchange (so limited possibility of competition). The value of money lies in the government backing it thanks to its real power and keeping the value relatively stable (controllable supply/demand).
In case of gold - well, it's something you can touch, that looks good and have some industrial application.
Bitcoins - as you said, seems to be a product of people's perception. And what is interesting - everybody value it relatively to dollars or other 'real' currencies.

So you think that after the fork everyone will get free money through B2X?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:35:18
CAD is currency in Canada, USD in US, that's the difference. In my example both currencies Bitcoin 1.0 and 2.0 are actually permitted on the same (world) market.
So now, if I was thinking about storing or transferring money online I'm not limited to old Bitcoin 1.0 but can use new Bitcoin 2.0 that has same limit of 21 mln but only 100 units minted so far. Maybe some big fishes who initially invested in bitcoin 1.0 decided to diversify by selling some Bitcoins 1.0 and buy 2.0. The value of 1.0 would drop then (as supply would be higher).
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:48:12
Got it. But I meant not B2X in particular but any other possible new currency, maybe less buggy and with better support.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:34:58
I really believe in Buffett (I'm kind of a 'invest in value' guy) but I also strongly believed in Google and Apple when he did not. And know he regrets not investing in them 10 years ago. 
Now I have mixed feelings about Bitcoin while he is sceptical.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:22:41


That's correct. But people give money value based on government action (that's why I said that the value lies in the gov backing the currency, not giving it any value). If the government is bad and there are shortages of commodities on the market - money will lose value as people would prefer to keep inventories full. So in relatively stable economies inflation is low. What would you do if suddenly all governments in the world banned bitcoin? Would you still keep it or buy more?
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:32:05


You can buy dumpling paying with... chickens. It's called barter transaction. You don't need government dollars, that's true. You could even pay with Enron stocks in 2000. Or with a blue pen if a bartender liked it. Still the question resolves about value.
I'm open to all suggestions on this matter, but I'm still not convinced. But thanks for your arguments. Will explore the topic further.

Market Cap = Number Of Bitcoins * BTC price
So currently there are 16.6 millions of Bitcoins outstanding and the price is 6.1k USD/BTC. It gives 100 billions USD of market cap (16.6m * 6.1k).
So capitalization is simply total value (in USD or other currency) of all bitcoins on the market. It doesn't affect the price, but price affects capitalization.

My intention is to find any kind of value (in other words: something that differentiates and favor BTC over other e-currencies). The one thing could be current capitalization (popularity) but it seems to be still very low thus not be a real edge over competing coins.

@_date: 2017-10-24 22:17:49
Yes, I think so. Existence of CAD doubles the supply of [currency] because of FX rates.
So if you printed a piece of paper with 1 trillion USD and agreed with everyone that this is also a binding currency - you would became very rich of course but the value of USD would drop.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:37:53
That's the point. If a new cryptocurrency, Bitcoin 2.0 from my example, had exactly the same mechanics/algos/usage/features as original Bitcoin - what is the difference?
Its like US government printing additional money with just new series number. Someone could say - Yeah, they can print, but it will be Series 2.0, not the original dollars with Series 1.0 I already got. So my Series 1.0 won't lose value. But in fact it doesn't matter, consumption power of both currencies is the same.
