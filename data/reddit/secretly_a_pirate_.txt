@_date: 2017-08-01 04:17:10

Mobile payments in China be far advanced compared to the west, and if a bitcoin clone be 100% Chinese owned and centrally controlled, it may get a government propaganda backing and stamp of approval. If that be happenin, then destination be Mars, not just moon. An Mars be red like communism.

If ye wants ter educate yourself about why, and what ye be making jokes about, then read [this](  If ye can sit through a real book instead of a website, then read [this.]( If ye don't care for the history of the Chinese civilisation and it's people, and just see them as a source of commie-nostalgia jokes, then ye can feel free to down vote this pirate's reprimand like a cur, and begone back to playin' fallout where ye can gun down Chinese commies without thinkin'
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:24:22

Ah never seen that one outside US/EUR ports myself.  Everywhere else ah ken be just like ye say - yer buy the car on credit, but one day it be yer own.
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:11:39
I be recommendin' ye use yer BTC ter buy [1oz o' gold in a government mint coin]( (no tax, haharrrr!) a month and keep it in a safety deposit box.  Yer BTC will likely continue ter go up, but buy diversifying into an anchor as powerful as gold ye will never be the guy down the dockhands bar telling' treasure tales about how he had his riches and blew it all.

Absolutely. Speak to a professional. A balanced portfolio of international stocks, bonds, property, precious metals and a little crypto for fun. Don’t put any more in crypto than you would punt on a horse race or football game. (Though admittedly I do this weekly, and it adds up)

Likewise. Hold the rest of the cash. Despite the bravado around here I think we will still see £4,000 or even below, but that is on gut feeling not technical analysis. If it’s still doing well after today, drop in £100 a day for 5 days

No, we are NOT better off 'losing t'Communist party.'  6 o' the worlds worst 10 wars by body count have been Chinese civil wars. Taiping Rebellion had a larger body count than World War 1. T'effect of a Chinese civil war on Western nations would also be catastrophic due to economic interdependency.

Narrr, it be better than real money, it be deflationary, so blown' it on barwenches be dumb as shit.  That be what inflationary fiat be for, an if ye dinnae have enough fiat fer barwenches, then ye shouldn't be sitting wit' em, should ye?
However, if ye pull out a gold sovereign and use it ter settle yer bar tab, ye get ter bring 2 Chinese wenches home, they get so frothy at t'sight o'gold.  An as t'barman is yer mate, ye get yer sovereign back and settle up in CNY after.

Me Chinese mother-in-law put $3,000 USD worth inter a fraudulent ICO that pretends ter be based on Californium (look it up!) They even have an app that be a near-direct copy of coinbase that tells her it keeps going up (even though Californium don't.... huh)  She be adamant that she gonna be rich, and t'lady-pirate an I just be holdin' our heads in our hands.  Apparently, she cannae cash out fer 6 months (its not allowed) an' she gets extra coins fer every friend she refers.  Hmmm.  She keeps trying ter get me ter sell some o' me gold an' buy inter her ICO.  BTW she is illiterate, an can barely read a shopping list.  This be why they are cracking down, an it be a good idea.  Bitcoin will survive, jus be knocked around a bit for a week or so.
