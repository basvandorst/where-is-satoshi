Gee, I wonder if that sort of thing will ever happen to anyone else? Nah. It would be really hard to mistake "Bitcoin" for "Bitcoin Cash". Nobody else will ever again make that mistake and lose money they can't afford to lose.
Anybody who says "Bitcoin Cash" wasn't a direct attack on bitcoin is a fool.

How creepy and counterproductive that something so inextricably associated with alt right racism gets sufficiently upvoted to show up on the front page of r/bitcoin. I hope everyone reading this will take a moment to downvote this thread.

Oh, bullshit.  The only way that image could possibly be more racist is if it also featured a klansman doing a Hitler salute in front of a burning cross.

Considering that Branson's net worth is $4.8 billion while the total market cap of bitcoin is $3.5 billion, my guess is that most of his wealth is not being stored in Bitcoin. ;)

Scarcity aside, bitcoin has divisibility and transferability options that gold will never have.
But even with that said, we should concede the point that there's great value to having something rare you can hold in your hand. If there were 21 million bitcoins and 21 million ounces of above ground gold, and they were equally priced, I'd much rather buy the gold.
What people don't understand is how ridiculously rare bitcoins are, given that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Compare that to the common estimate of 6 billion ounces of above ground gold.
*disclosure, I own bitcoin and silver.

"Too complex for the average individual?" Depends on what you're doing with it, right? If you're using Bitcoin as a store of value, for instance, then buying some through Coinbase or Gemini is every bit as easy as setting up an online brokerage account to buy shares of Apple.
There's a spectrum of use cases, through the dead-simple on up to esoteric possibilities that will always be too complicated for 98% of us early adapters.

Now all Bitcoin needs is another 9 billion of market cap and it'll be worth more than PayPal *and* Western Union combined. That'll be a significant moment. It wasn't until a year or two ago that Bitcoin surpassed Western Union.

I love it because it's a more exciting word than fees and one that's more in line with what's really happening: every ten minutes some bitcoin "escapes" and the first one to find it keeps it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:56:35
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't they buy about 1 percent of all bitcoins when the cost was well under $100/each?
Yeah, what a pair of incompetents. ;)
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:16:24
But the *artists* could choose to do this, whenever they wanted—and bypass the labels entirely. If you were in a band and were the sole rights-holder to your music, would you not make your music available for sale via bitcoin, at a very reasonable price per song or album—especially if doing so took you an afternoon to set everything up?
And the smarter labels would do the same. They are, after all, in the business of taking people's money. :)

If you're investing in something that's officially denominated in fiat, you are investing in fiat. Worse, in fact—in bad times you'll have to rely on brokerages and banks if you want to convert your AMZN shares or whatever back into cash. That may prove problematic.
If we experience severe inflation or hyperinflation, watch what happens to the real value of stocks and bonds.

Volume doesn't **cause** a spike. A willingness for sufficient people to pay a given dollar amount per coin is what causes a spike.

2% every year is an insane amount for an ETF, about 50 times the fees tied to some ETFs. Do you have a link to support this claim? Do you or anyone know how those fees will compare to the pending Winklevoss ETF?

It would make more sense if this sentence started with "The" instead of "A".
I find myself sometimes confused about whether a sentence is referring to the Bitcoin blockchain, an altcoin's blockchain, or some other distributed ledger floated by god knows who. I wouldn't be surprised if ultimately the manner of distinguishing between these possibilities is that the the B in blockchain gets capitalized when it refers to the bitcoin blockchain but it's lowercase for all other blockchains.
That's far the from perfect solution since confusion will be inevitable. But I suspect that at this point the word "blockchain" has been sufficiently diluted that there needs to be some alternate word to make clear that the ledger in question refers specifically to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Wouldn't $387 million mean the company was holding about 10 percent of all bitcoins now in circulation? Surely that can't be right, unless they were taking money for bitcoins without going ahead and purchasing them.

The thing that makes me feel best about Bitcoin isn't that the arguments for it are so great, it's that the arguments against it are so consistently silly and based largely on faulty information. If this article offers one of the stronger cases against Bitcoin then I'm really glad I bought some coins!

That's a lot of digits so it therefore must be a lot of bitcoin.

Do you think Coinbase truly cares about whether people use bitcoin to gamble? Or are they doing it to comply with federal regulations, knowing they'd be shut down if they didn't comply?
I strongly suspect the latter.

You so realize you don't need to buy or sell in increments of an entire bitcoin? One bitcoin can be divided into a hundred million Satoshis, so you can buy as much or as little bitcoin as you want.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:54:36
I'm sorry but that's just dumb. A fork split creates uncertainty about Bitcoin's future, and lowers the price of all coins associated with it. It's like saying you can cut off my arm and then my arm and the rest of my body will be worth more combined than they were before you cut it off.
Having said that, my intuition is that the bip148 people will blink first, realizing their demands are hopeless, and no forking will occur. Nobody wants a hard fork, and $5 transaction fees are trivial in an ecosystem where for now the only real reason to buy Bitcoin is to as a long-term store of value.

It's used every time somebody invests in it. And every person who HODLs bitcoin is keeping it in short supply.
A lot of people seem to think that bitcoin needs people to be buying stuff with it in order for the price to go up, but to me that seems irrelevant. I'd expect bitcoin to be useful for a great many things in the years ahead, but for now I believe its one and only killer app is as a store of value.
