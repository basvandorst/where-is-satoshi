I don’t agree mate!
The best way to establish BTC in Mainstream is to post pictures, news, reports, analysis etc...
And btw....I’m working almost around the world and it’s nice to see that in some places I’ve been before, now an btc-atm.

Very helpful ��
Don’t listen to that post!
Forgett day trading....u will loose money, FOR SURE!
Try to get into after a big dump like now. Don’t be afraid when it drops further, cos btc is not for fast cash...it’s a long term investment. 
Hodl baby!!

I’m totally calm 
If you felt offended....I apologize 
Didn’t know that the whole point of reddit is, to get as much votes as possible. 
I’m on the same site mate ✌️
