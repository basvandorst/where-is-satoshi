It could go up, it could go down!
Excellent analysis as usual, 10/10 prediction 
@_date: 2018-09-15 20:04:17
Yup you got it. We gotta know how much you recovered! 
@_date: 2018-09-14 00:16:45
Wow, this has to be the worst chart I've ever seen. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 01:44:16
Rebuy because it's definitely going to $50k
Plummets to .50

Uhh because in order for that to really happen you need to actually spend it and make it a currency and add real incentive. Otherwise it's essentially a speculative Ponzi scheme.

Explain yourself, heathen 
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:10:03
What the fuck 200x? Are you people not capable of doing some simple math?
6.3k x 200 = $1,260,000 
That means bitcoin would have a market cap of 20T dollars. 
 
That is 4x more than the entire world supply of coinage and bank notes.
I don't think there's a such thing as "easily" increasing to that number.  
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:42:11
Nobody knows and they're lying if they say they do, but if past cycles repeat again then those are the numbers I would be guessing we see. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:53:41
But it's already priced in 
@_date: 2018-08-27 21:06:35
Yeah it's just a rough estimate. 
10x from $6,000 floor puts us at $60,000.
In reality I think the "hype" becomes "Bitcoin is going to reach 100,000!" which causes everyone to buy-in the same as the "BTC is hitting $10k" hype that set in around $6,000 last year. 
Wouldn't be suprised to see us pop $100k into $150,000 territory, followed by a pop down to $30k.
People will say bitcoin is dead at $30k lol before the pump to $500k... 
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:37:56
Can't he also get out before then?

Hal Finney received the first bitcoin tx from Satoshi Nakomoto.
If you just mined the first ever block of BTC and you needed to test a send transaction, who would you send it to? 
It's almost a 100% guarantee that you would send it to yourself. You want to be able to follow the sequence every step of the way. 
It's very VERY likely that Hal Finney is satoshi nakomoto. 
He passed awhile back, which is why Hans here says "from his grave".

$1T in bot wash trades 
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:01:33
If you figure approx 10x each run.. I'd put it around $50,000 with a retrace down to around $15,000 after it pops 
@_date: 2018-08-03 22:07:53
I'm all in on VRP

Hooray, destroying the planet for financial gains!

And a subsequent ETF rejection would yield what? $3k?
The last ETF was rejected and I'm quite certain the atmosphere has only gotten worse since then. The likelihood of ETF approval seems slim to none. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 03:53:16
That's not at all how it works 
@_date: 2018-10-31 02:26:58
I volunteer as tribute 
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:54:03
Because it worked, duh!

To store value. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 19:42:49
I believe he is satoshi 
Hal received the first transaction 
He was a core developer and designer of the network
If i were ready to test the first bitcoin transaction ever, I'd be inclined to send it to myself. It was essentially a test, and most developers test them self before releasing into the wild.

Other than the 40 starbucks stores of course 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:47:07
Sitting high and mighty on your coffee thrown, eh?
I know there's better coffee but Starbucks does have good offerings and it's pretty obvious by the billions of cups sold. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:38:38
Still less than March though, when we were in free fall 
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:12:04
The greater fool? I'm not selling you a timeshare. You have the chance to purchase and spread a global deflationary financial system. I'm not waiting for the greater fool, I'm waiting for the greater good.

Isn't the floor 0? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:24:29
Stop using the term "never" unless you can keep it in perspective. Eventually our sun will burn out and life on earth will likely end long before then. You think BTC network will outlast earth itself?

The next financial crisis won't result in too big to fail. It will be too big to exist.

It's an issue in a bear market and a blessing in a bull market. 
If you can't handle the 80% dips, you don't deserve the 8000% gains 
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:09:38
It's not about how likely it is. It's the floor regardless of likelihood. 
Eventually? Everything will be lost to time, even BTC. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:54:05


This isn't a matter of opinion.
The average price or "turn off cost" has not been breached.
Don't forget the big players are playing in a place where they have special deals with the electric companies, local government, or have massive solar farms.

I disagree. Gambling is a billion dollar industry and way way deeper than the Silk Road. Sportsbooks and poker sites were way more pivotal than the black market. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:24:33
Bro, are you serious? 
Not only do they lend 97%, at the same time they are using your funds to gamble on the market. And guess what lending allows them to do? Get more money to gamble. And what do we know about gambling? The house always wins. 
It's only a matter of time until we're right back to 2008.

Pretty sure if it was $6.30 you wouldn't be so happy that 1 BTC = 1 BTC

Instant return. Buy $50,000 of BTC for $41,500. 
Sell for $50,000 on exchange. 
$9,000 profit in an instant.

The paradox is that so many incorrect predictions have been made, it's resulted in the definite conclusion that the correct prediction has been made, even if accidentally so. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:34:12
I like charts because they're all made up

It's definitely a paradox. And it's exactly how probability works. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:41:16
I don't think you understand how percentages work,  bud.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:29:01
Imo bottom is around $750-$1250 
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:10:32
It only takes once for it to actually die. We're falling into the mass prediction paradox. So many predictions have been made at this point, eventually somebody is going to be right.

BTC is a good bb shhhh let her be sad fr a minut.
She had a breakup with ugly investors and uninformed general public.
She will return to those of us who actually need her and start to build again.
But bb is sensitiv and we don't know how long it will take here to realize hauw bootiful she is.
I see you though girl. I SEE YOU.
