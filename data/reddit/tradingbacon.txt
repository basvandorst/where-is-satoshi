In other words, the economy would freeze from lack of trade.  An economy thrives on trade, and without it companies will collapse and people will lose their jobs.  Deflation is BAD.
Fiat is not meant to be an investment, only a medium of exchange.

If you check blockchain there is an address which has received 780k bitcoin over the course of a year, I don't think there is a conspiracy here.

I had no idea what days destroyed meant so here's the definition for those that are curious:
"The idea of "bitcoin days destroyed" came about because it was realised that total transaction volume per day might be an inappropriate measure of the level of economic activity in Bitcoin. After all, someone could be sending the same money back and forth between their own addresses repeatedly. If you sent the same 50 btc back and forth 20 times, it would look like 1000 btc worth of activity, while in fact it represents almost nothing in terms of real transaction volume.
With "bitcoin days destroyed", the idea is instead to give more weight to coins which haven't been spent in a while. To do this, you multiply the amount of each transaction by the number of days since those coins were last spent. So, 1 bitcoin that hasn't been spent in 100 days (1 bitcoin * 100 days) counts as much as 100 bitcoins that were just spent yesterday (100 bitcoins * 1 day). Because you can think of these "bitcoin days" as building up over time until a transaction actually occurs, the actual measure is called "bitcoin days destroyed". This is believed to give a better indication of how much real economic activity is occurring on the bitcoin network." - [source](

I work exactly 1 block away from this place and it doesn't look anything like the place in the picture.  [This is what it looks like.](
It's extremely cramped and the line is usually at least an hour at lunchtime, the ramen is pretty damn good though.  I'll usually wait until 1-1:30pm or so when the lunch crowd starts to die down before I attempt to go there.

A seed phrase is usually generated by wallet software / hardware automatically, so what would people use bip39 for?
It seems dangerous to enter phrases into a website, even if it's https and not a phishing scam.

ETH didn't lose funds the funds, Parity did. Big difference.

I’ve never coded with rust but that sounds like an amazing benefit. Some of the most frustrating and time consuming problems I’ve had to debug were caused by memory corruption.
