I have recently joined the community and love learning more about bitcoin.  The problem is I'm wasting too much time reading.  There should be a platform only sharing meaningful news. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:51:22
Indeed, bitcoin is handeling itself pretty good during these rough times. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:21:51
Yes i know these sites,
my question is how people know WHO is selling or buying.
Guess they have some inside information

electron cash, it worked perfectly for me

@_date: 2017-08-01 20:16:43
Is it because I made the new wallet (wallet B) before the fork?
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:05:33
BTC right now because of low amount of transactions (empty mempool)
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:16:02
I tried that but something went wrong. Here is what I did.
I had BTC wallet (wallet A) 
Yesterday I made a new wallet (Wallet B)
Just now I sent my BTC from wallet A to wallet B, after that openen wallet A using electron cash. But the transaction I made to wallet B is also on the electron cash wallet (but unconfirmed). Now I can't acces the BCH.

Deposited to 'viaBTC' traded for BTC, noticed BTC withdrawals are offline. Trading for ETH now and then try withrawing
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:14:18
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:33:58
Also, I believe there will be a sell off but not that hard and bitcoin might break new ATH's just weeks after

The weird thing is it only took 5min for me yesterday
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:13:34
I split my BTC using 'electron cash', sold it on 'viaBTC'

@_date: 2017-08-02 14:45:16
worked fine for me
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:28:33
bitcoin cash, some exchanges also refer to it as BCC
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:59:13
Restart your wallet. It will resolve itself 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:03:47
Steal your enemies picture
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:33:04
I agree. There may be a sell of. But when? Just before or just after segwit activates. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:28:04
Can I already send my BTC to new wallet so I can later on import my old private key in Bitcoin cash wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:53:34
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:23:25
anyone else trying out BCH wallet 'electron cash'. I sent my BTC with electrum to a new wallet and then opened my old wallet on electrum cash. But my transactions I made with electrum are also on there (but unconfirmed)
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:05:48
Wait until the wide public gets the chance to sell their bch
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:51:11
heard BTC-e is very private XD  
I think that will be very hard to find man. I told you about 'viaBTC' because it's just a picture they ask. No further verification. Done in 2 mins. So its a formality if you know what I mean ;)
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:04:54
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:35:29
Yes that could be. Only 2 blocks were mined at the time. After wallet restart it resolved itself
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:11:06
Try this, check if your BCC is there on electron cash
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:18:12
Well, I asked my question yesterday, right after the fork. I waited until the first blocks were mined and then moved my BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:20:03
I think it should be possible, don't have time to research atm. Let me know if it works out. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:16:41
yes 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:44:47
'viaBTX' only pic of ID done in 5mins.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:26:32
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:35:40
We now have long build up of market pricing in segwit already. IMO there will be a sell of as it activates, after that prices will go up again. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:42:14
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:59:40
restart wallet and it resolves itself. Still haven't found exchange to deposit to yet
Testing a deposit to 'viaBTC' but i don't trust those guys
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:23:57
Anyone know any good exchanges for Europeans? Fast and cheap sepa deposits/withdraws?
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:28:52
What's the brand of the machine? Generalbites? Cointed?
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:41:37
Oooh yeah. Spoiler; that wall gets burned down pretty fast :D
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:39:25
Is there something similar to view the wealth distributions in altcoins? 
@_date: 2017-04-30 11:26:51
I'm not asking for your opinion on altcoins. Just wondering if there are similar sites for altcoins. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:23:38
 The Commission's recent enforcement actions involving AirFox, Paragon, Crypto Asset Management, TokenLot, and EtherDelta's founder,[\[3\]]( discussed further below, illustrate the importance of complying with these requirements. Broadly speaking, the issues raised in these actions fall into three categories: (1) initial offers and sales of digital asset securities (including those issued in initial coin offerings ("ICOs")); (2) investment vehicles investing in digital asset securities and those who advise others about investing in these securities; and (3) secondary market trading of digital asset securities. Below, we provide the Divisions' views on these issues.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:12:23
Wow, cool man
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:15:01
Did you sell high and now sharing some with the less fortunate? :P
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:31:39
 The Commission found that EtherDelta's activities clearly fell within the definition of an exchange and that EtherDelta's founder caused the platform’s failure either to register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from registration as an exchange.[\[13\]]( 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:21:43
As far as I can tell nothing new. 
ICO's should register, decentralized exchanges should register, brokers providing ICO tokens should register...
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:21:10
Indeed. Irl there's 20 others after this guy each taking a larger cut. And like you said all that for an automatic service.
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:27:39
 AirFox and Paragon will pay penalties and also have undertaken to register the tokens as securities under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:13:48
Nah, Just a joke in general. This reminded me of inefficient banking services.  
To go deeper on your remark. True, BTC venders take quite some cuts at this point in time. Exchanges do too. I don't blame them. The market is still small and if it wasn't for exchanges taking the risk to do business in an unregulated market then we couldn't trade. 
The bankers are still the crooks for taking buying power away from work class people for decades.
   
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:06:54
Ohh nice even trading back online. How is this possible? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:34:25
why is price on BTC-e so much higher?
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:17:48
o are they, that's interesting.
So then it's gonna be like an private ICO. Thrown on exchanges and pumped to oblivion
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:54:13
what I sent them:
Dear Mr/Ms,
Like many others I believe in a limited currency like Bitcoin in contrary to the unlimited printed fiat currencies.
More people start to understand the Bitcoin philosophy and I think we gradually move more to cryptocurrencies.
Right now people just want to invest in it, expecting real use cases in the future.  The problem is that this new technology is not user friendly. 
I have discouraged friends and family to buy crypto because I believe they will get hurt. I have told them to learn more before trying to buy on a random exchange. 
I noticed non techy people simply aren’t able to buy and store cryptocurrencies in a safe way. This is why I believe an ETF should be the way for common people to invest safely in a promising technology.
Kind regards,
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:27:59
I really don't know. Don't have enough experience. But this is a strange one. it seems like only Chinese miners support it. If it drops they might let it go.

BIP91 signaling is now back below 80%
shouldn't the lock in period go back to scratch?
back to 236 blocks

Yeah but it bch chain dies in 2 days it won't get back to 0.1 btc

He doesn't hide that he is a strong ETH supporter. Therefor he covers a lot of ETH and other altcoin news. But he believes in the future of all cryptocurrencies. And he also values the fact that bitcoin is a store of value. That is why I like to follow the guy to know the most important news, because cryptocurrencies affect each other. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:07:45
Hah, look adam the crypromeister, 'chinacoins' 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:27:35
Can't agree more tbh. Short term it might help for the price.
But I would like to see Bitcoin do good without traditional financial instruments. It's good that people are forced to learn how to manage their own security. But we need time for that. Young people are starting to adopt but still very slow.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:09:05
Crypt0s news. Honest guy, educated and clear explanations 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:25:11
No problem, and even for a bitcoin maximalist ETH news can be interesting. As ETH is growing bigger and has influence even on BTC ;)

@_date: 2018-12-06 21:43:51
Found this article.  Strange thing is I don't find a statement on the SEC site. Would this be an effort from coindesk to crash the price?
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:44:41
I am a noob considering the experienced people here. Sharp appreciation maybe not. But I for a fact switched back from ETH to BTC. My feeling tells me the flow of wealth from BTC to altcoins will come to a halt. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:42:31
Why is the price not following this sentiment?
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:33:00
I feel like ethereum is finding solutions much faster than btc. I hope for eth all the updates go successfully. Because at the rate eth is growing these updates can't be delayed too much.
