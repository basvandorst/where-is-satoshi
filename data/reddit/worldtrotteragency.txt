Well, we can't compare our agency to cheapair or Expedia but as a local travel agency we participate in Bitcoin we've come up by accepting bitcoin as a mode of payment. You can't book online, you need to contact us first but we accept bitcoin to book whatever you want: flights, hotels and packages!

Worldtrotter is now accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of payment.
We are glad to be the first travel agency in the Philippines to accept this payment!

Bitcoin opens door not only to us but also to the customers who prepare to pay through Bitcoin not like other online booking companies too many changers and that makes our agency cheaper than cheapair.com
We will be glad to give you our services and you can follow us on

Our agency is not an online booking like cheapair, we do communicate with our costumers and listen to their concerns and suggestions.
We do have an existing office in Dasmarinas City, Cavite (30 miles from manila) with legal documents such as DTI, Mayor's permit, sanitary permit to operate and others. I understand your concern about "agency scams" just like you i am very much aware of scams not only in other countries but also here in the Philippines, I've seen it a lot because i am also a traveler. Futhermore, I have been working on Bitcoin since 2013 and like you I'm aware of scams and I don't trust easily business which accepts btc! We are honest and this is completely legit. Don't hesitate to use our service and do a feedback to Bitcoin community.
To give a proof that our agency is legal you can follow us on facebook or you can email us at travel we'll send you a copy of our supporting documents. We do believe in Bitcoin and we also want to extent our services to other part of the world with it! 
We are currently using coins.ph to process the payment but soon we will use bitmarket.ph to better manage invoices.
Thank you very much for your concern and support and don't hesitate to contact us for more information.
