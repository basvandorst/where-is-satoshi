What cloud mining pool would you recommend?
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:54:08
I had cloud mining with them for a while never had a problem. But I do have miners set up although bitmain is not selling any right now 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:18
I know, I saw some r/btc on the front page and it's just them bashing on us and sucking Rogers cock and if you mention anything about bitcoin insta banned. We have some sensoring issues too since my post for auto removed for mentioning cash but it's not as bad though

What energy problem? I think my $10,000 energy bill is very affordable, plus free heating for the entire neighborhood 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:53:03
It lost 50% in a couple months but look at it long run, not even when it was less than a penny but when it was $20 $300 even  $1000 it still gained in value 
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:20:09
This is why we need to use bitcoin....not just hodl it no matter the price or situation 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:51:27
Don't buy it everyday though, thays gonna be a lot of money wasted in fees, get it like once a week with low fees since I guess you don't need the transaction to happen right away
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:38:28
I used to have coinbase, their bitcoins are also more expensive by a small margin, let's say BTC is $12,000 on coinbase it would be like $12,050
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:34:06
Lmao you proved me right?
I never said it's not growing but everytime it goes up and down by miniscule amounts no point of everyone freaking out as if it's December rush, or the afterward downfall.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:18:41
99% are in it for the price that's why it spiked up in December
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:50:44
Money needs to be circulated though. I think it's called the spending multiplier. Basically if you give the bank $1000 it will turn into let's say $10,000 because they loan it out then that guy uses it so on and so on. If the money sits in one place it's no good to anyone
It's based off the savings rate and some other stuff 
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:08:16
I agree man, there are a lot of problem with it especially since China owns tons of mining etc. But that will all eventually spread our and be okay
My problem is people's mindset is still stuck in "Invest $100 never sell, NEVER, make a few millions" hodling is good and all but we need to get btc to the next level 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:26:01
Thanks haha, it's just that whenever the price falls all I see is HODL this, price that as if bitcoin is a stock 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:49:08
I'm against bch, I can probably dig it up in my history somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 04:02:55
If it's a million rubles I'd be happy, 16.6K lmao
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:55:05
Well it doesn't need to be 100% confirmed. Just accepted into the network. I know there's some shops and hotdog stands that accept it don't think they make people wait around for 20min to get the food
Also I haven't used lightning but isn't that basically instant?
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:33:58
The price went up because people started using it
Yeah holding it makes it more scarce and limits the supply, but I'm sure the top 1% holds a huge part of the market, that's one reason it's gonna be a roller coaster for a while as they sell off their thousands of btc. 
But using it makes people more aware of it, and like you said simple economics, if there's more demand and less supply it will go up
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:56:39
Yeah but people on here plan on not selling it until that tile of land is worth as much as if it was in Manhattan. You have to start using the land and making it useful before it gains value while keeping some of it stashed aside for when the total land value goes up
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:28:34
Exactly, the whole reason BTC went up to 20K wasn't because of tech, it wasn't because of mining or anything. It was all hype, but the hype was towards people hearing how a guy bought a lambo with $20 in BTC. 
It's all about the people, even if price stays under 10K for years, but if we get people to actually use BTC then it will slowly be recognized and price will adjust with the use like it did in December 
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:54:50
So you're saying bitcoin is useless? Then why are you holding on to something that you can only spend in 3 shops?
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:59:01
Get that 32 core AMD processor, you can mine and heat your whole neighborhood at the same time 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:28:59
Oh ya mining is like 100% China haha. There's a few other places that do it but mostly there. Thing that sucks is because it was so cheap back in the day there's a lot of people that control a big amount of it but as they slowly dump it out the price will eventually stabilize 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:18:20
Yeah I've been using it to pay ppl on reddit since I had some art and stuff done
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:47:34
Nah it's not too late, if anything it's a good time, price is decently stable (6-8K) it's easy to use and fees are at the lowest. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:48:14
Lmaooooo, wtf I'm way against bch I think I'm even banned from there. I'm just saying this forum should promote btc use and spread it instead of just saying hodl and we will all be millionaires 
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:43:25
Okay what does then? Please educate me 
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:30:08
Yeah that's why now is a really good time to get people into it. I think transaction fees are like what 10 satoshis? And you get it under 20min. If you want it instant I think about 50ish which is still a few cents, there's a nice website bitcoinfees.21.co (they have a new link but that still works) that shows what you should pay and how long the eta is  
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:23:58
Thanks for agreeing. People are saying I'm supporting bch lol but I've been in btc since way back. I think we need to start changing the mindset that bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme and get more people to use it since even if it'd worth a dollar it's a way better system than current banks.
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:21:01
Yeah, it's the biggest problem of getting people into it. It changes too much for someone to depend on it as a currency right now. 
 That's awesome, what type of work do you guys publish?
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:45:18
I agree and disagree.
The whole parking lot thing, it's based on percentage, compare what 1 cent to $20,000 it's a 2 million percent return. Now let's multiply that by 8K which is kinda where we're at. You're looking at a bitcoin being 16 billion dollars. Now maybe if it'd a global currency that's possible but not in any short time. And I know most people don't even have a full bitcoin.
That's why I'm saying hold some and spend some. Have like a savings account where you put some btc to hodl until you're rich and other to spend. 
The other problem is people will eventually have to spend, if everyone on this sub is still hodling when it does hit 16 billion, then the price will be too unstable since one person can just dump a whole bunch out which is what we have happening in the last year, one person who bought in when it wad pennies can influence the whole market. In order for it to reach that price it needs to be a lot more stable.
 
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:17:55
Do I get to choose the color 
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:01:12
There are rumors....but they won't use BTC they will most likely make their own coin that they can control and so on. I already see a lot of random coins that websites try to use or something there's too many to keep track
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:56:38
You're welcome man, I'm gonna go back to my very busy day
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:15:11
Yeah, have you ever looked at those proof of stake currencies? Oh man that whole market is just broken. If you're not familiar it's similar to BTC but instead of mining the money multiplies it self. Everyone is like hey I made $200 with my $50 and then next week it crashes to nothing
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:08:38
Glad to see that man, I got a wallet that I don't use with some BTC on it and it's my long term fund. Then I got the everyday wallet for trading and buying stuff online 
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:42:43
Nice, yeah my old setup has the 8 core and bulldozer, it's still good and can handle any game I think the processors are way too far ahead as to what we need. Plus it's really good in the winter can head up the space around the pc and keep you warm
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:58:01
Some dude was selling those as btc and I think he made a lot before he was busted lol. That's another problem people need to know what bitcoin is and that you can buy pieces of it since most people say I don't have that type of money.
Yeah it's not a stock but it's treated as one, as in its not a currency it's just something you buy wait for it to go in price and sell. Buy low and sell high
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:52:30
I remeber steam used to accept bitcoin but it doesn't anymore :'(
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:30:52
Honestly that's a good plan but tell it to your everyday business owner they will say no. People choose security, stability and simplicity. Bitcoin is slowly becoming those though 
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:56:22
Yeah I fucked up posting it right now since people think I mean spend it because the price is low. I'm definately waiting until it goes back up but I spend some btc every chance I get, if I see something online that accepts it I'll use BTC over cash. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:09:18

The criminal activity was the foundation of btc, even though they are moving towards monero etc it's always there.
Yeah I'm getting people telling me I'm a bch supporter even though I never mentioned it haha. I said what I had if people don't listen it's cool if they do then that's cool too
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:50:38
So wait do you invest in btc? I'm just curious as to why you're on the sub.
And the dollar has been doing good, it was weak vs the euro for a while now but is slowly growing, 1.14 USD for a EUR, was like 1.25 a few months ago and funny thing when Trump won it went from like 1.1ish to almost even
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:22:48
So then why do you hodl it if you know at any given time China can sell 99% of btc and crash it down to $20
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:17:43
Yeah my biggest problem when I tried to get a store to use it "didn't it just crash to...." it still needs to stabilize a lot more since many people don't want to risk selling their $5 coffee but getting paid $2 for it.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:59:49
Lol how are you not banned from this sub?
If you want good money get in on those Chinese markets, btc is always a lot cheaper and some have no fees, flip it to the usd market and profit all the time 
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:27:10
Haha what? If you haven't noticed that's exactly what I'm doing in my post. I just know btc and bch subs will ban pretty easily when you speak out of line 
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:36:03
What coin do you use? 
Visa is free for the user not the stores though, I think they take up to 5% on the smaller scale but it's all because of how widely used the system is. Bitcoin is pretty cheap to send and cheaper with larger transaction right now as opposed to wiring money etc. You can send $100K for like 10 cents.
The speed is getting there but it won't ever be insured unless it's a national currency so yeah it's not a currency yet but if people want it to be more than just a stock we have to put in work 
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:58:01
Damn, there's a few ways to get it unstuck, you can manually do it or check our some transaction accelerators
Also the new feature of increasing fees is nice 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:46:19
Yep get the word out to everyone to spend their btc, but also spend some yourself so that people see that you are doing what you preach 
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:46:21
Hahaha, I remeber a friend telling me someone in Washington has a mining rig so big that two of the power plants basically run just for him
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:35:18
Yeah but if no one is using the crypto then it will slowly fade away. Like I told the other guy if it's wide use then there's more demand and if there's more demand then price will go up
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:51:54
Yep, I've helped a few small businesses set up bitcoin wallets and accept them. But the biggest issue with them, and everyone the stability. Even if they cash out by the end of the day they might have lost a few hundred dollars, although most people do it because it's easy to use or because they believe it it's far from wide use and we need to try and work on that 
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:16:07
I mean if you think of it in a reasonable way its just like a loan, you give them lets say $10K they use it to get hardware and make themselves 15K out of which you get 12K....that is if they werent rigged.
But thanks for all the answers
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:19:46
Thanks, yeah all Ive read about Genesis seems like its all a scam and they use refrence codes to lure people in more. 
How profitable is ViaBTC? How long did it take to earn your investment back?
Thanks for all the replies btw, I might do Via, or just build a rig the problem with that is Im currently traveling and not staying in one spot for too long, I can have my brother set it up but im not sure if he knows how, that is why im looking into cloud vs building a rig
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:39:43
Very misleading title. They consider abandoning it and they are pushing to do so in 21 stores plus some gas stations. A nation wide ban of visa would cost them too much business
@_date: 2019-03-04 19:34:27
At the same time people have preferences. Maybe the visa is a debit card and the others are credits. They don't want to use it for groceries etc. Or maybe the visa has better benefits so they want to use it.
Either way it's not like they banned all cards and adopted bitcoin, it's far from being adopted into the major supermarkets since your average Joe doesn't have any btc or even know how to use it 
@_date: 2019-03-03 20:00:19
Why confuse people more, there's already too many people who think bitcoin cash is bitcoin. Now you want to change the symbol confusing more people and leading them to btc cash because it looks right 
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:36:25
And that's you man, I've worked retail people will get pissed off at you because their card got declined because they don't have money on it.
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:25:36
Figured it out guys
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:21:20
Awesome let me know, I read online you can use cointape im trying to look into it but never done this before so I am confused.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:17:38
So Im using the BTC core wallet, and I have the fee set to fast now which is like .0007786 BTC/kb. Do you think that will work?
Also it says I dont have that much in my balance any way I can cancel it?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:12:13
In November the blocks will be 2mb, or somewhere around that time I forgot the exact block number it will go in effect
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:02:27
More like a bunch of 1 days lol, I don't even see why those are considered in a long run table when it's more of outliers, that's like saying btc jumped up to 6400 a week ago then crashed to 5800 and putting it on there 
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:25:35
Everyone saying bitcoin is expensive is right and wrong. Depends on who you look at, you can transfer 100K with BTC for a few bucks, where visa and banks charge a few hundred bucks if not more. You can spend a few bucks and pay cents with visa, with bitcoin that's sometimes the case but not always. And that's the problem for a lot of transactions the network would have to also be sped up
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:37:29
Well yeah there's a lot of problems but if it gets adapted as widely as visa I'm sure at that point the network will actually be lightning fast with low fees and all that stuff, but that's years away since the price needs to stabilize at first so it can go from people just using it as an investment to actual currency, risky for merchants to accept a currency that can drop 10 times a day so by the time they cash out they actually wouldn't have made any profit on that sale 
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:29:03
Well you're either very lucky or very rich then. I know most places and banks have a lot of fees if not for user than the supplier 
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:07:12
The article is kinda broad and misleading. There's different ways money base can be measured. If they are just measuring physical (m1) then ya bitcoin is gonna be one of the largest because most of the fiat is not held in cash. If they are measuring other things like money market funds etc (m2) then BTC would be way down on the list
I mean think about it....Bill Gates, Bezos and 2-3 more billionaires can buy 100% of btc...they are all in USD, so 3 people that use USD have more then all of BTC.
Not to say bitcoin ain't going up but fake/misinformative news is a cancer than needs to be slain
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:56:40
The problem is still that visa is what people use, so there's fees regardless and if it's a % based those add up. That's not every country and either way that's a government organization, if the government backs bitcoin it will be the same 
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:19:22
Transferring to someone else who's not in the same bank or better yet different country? 
I know Fargo or I think most banks it's totally free to transfer in between bank, but different bank or country is a lot more
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:40:40
Well same can be said for bitcoin, in certain situations you can transfer $100K or any amount for a few cents.
I've traveled a lot and most banks aren't like that, there's fees for everything or they would be broke 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:51:04
It won't go down by that much. If you look at the overall chart it bursts but always has a higher minimum then before so the price is always higher at the end. It went from 5K to 3K then from 6K to 4K now maybe from 7K or 8K since it's still going up down to 6K. It's because more people are buying it and the people that have thousands of bitcoin can mess up the market by selling it all at once for cheap. But as time goes by less and less people hold more bitcoin so as it gets more evenly spread out the price will be higher and stabilize even more.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:24:16
Find someone who accepts house payments in bitcoin haha
But I wonder if there is a way to avoid taxes, technically in a way it's not like a stock where you gained profits since it is considered a currency. I can see this being brought up to court since you're just basically exchanging currencies
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:42:28
I think he invested a million back in 2011, bitcoin was dirt cheap back then he can easily single handed crash the market if that is true. But I think it's more of a snowball effect, he sells a big amount cheap people panic sell it cheap and so on, then they flood with tons of useless transactions slowing everything down. 
On top of that it has been going up a lot, and this is still a positive over a month, probably will go back up to 6500 and stabilize there. I'm still thinking it can hit 10K by the end of the year, same thing happened last fork, price dropped people mined BCH and in a week bitcoin pikes up BCH drops 
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:07:59
The article and title are really misleading
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:24:06
I always use bitcoinfees.21.co or bitcoinfees.earn.com it's the same website and it tells you in detail how many transactions are being processed for that fee, how many have been done daily, and what's the wait time in both blocks and time. That way you can see what's a good price to pay and have an estimate of the time it takes. Right now the network is clogged probably will for about a week so the recommended price is 440 satoshis. Normally that's about 180 (for 20min wait) so for 2 hours I'd say like 130-150 if not less which is pretty cheap. 
There are a few accelerators, I have an account with VIABTC and I remeber their service being free but I think you need to mine with them in order to use it but either way check it out. Besides that wait a week after the network is hopefully not under attack and it will be cheap again
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:52:41
I'd recommend cloud mining, I personally use ViaBTC and have made 3 times my investment since March of this year. Their contracts sold out but they have a market where you can buy it from people for a lil more. They payout rate is still good about 180-230 days (depending on the price) you get the balance added to your wallet daily plus you get to use their transaction accelerator feature.
Check em out
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:03:05
Well if he brings all that money over they will charge him a % at customs since you have to declare it. I'd say get an accountant, and a really good one so they can do it properly where you pay the least amount of taxes 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:01:24
That guy that posted the video about bitcoin always dripping was right!!! I shouldn't have sold my house and bought bitcoin it always crashes
That's just sarcasm, it's crazy how this new low of 6700 was the max not even a month ago and we're already back at 6800
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:18:01
I remeber the pool I use supporting it all over their website. VIABTC and I like them since they had the transaction accelerator tool. I still think it's a good idea but also how it's being executed is bad. People are just trying to make money now instead of doing the good thing, there's constant attacks on the network clogging it up. I remeber just a few weeks ago when things were calm the transaction fees were 120-180 satoshis with like 10,000 unconfirmed and still tons of transactions that week. 
If they don't like bitcoin then they can leave do BCH or whatever they want. If it's such a great and innovative technology that's beyond bitcoin with time people will realize it and switch over. But attacking Bitcoin is just greedy and manipulative. It took it years to get noticed and it's still growing. They should do their thin we will do ours and let's all be friends here and enjoy this tech :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:41:05
Yeah I mean I'm expecting this bubble to burst down to 6K or so but I'm still day trading some since it keeps going up. Either way the new minimum is the old max point so it will always go up in the long run
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:47:25
Because the government is corrupt, last time I checked Satoshi isn't lobbying senators and getting them in his pocket. Plus they always love targeting the general masses over the 1%

That's the problem with it. It wasn't meant to make people millionaires it was meant to be used as currency.  99% of people who are in it only think about HODL and getting lambos. That's why the market is what it is now.

@_date: 2017-10-05 16:03:27
Yeah I noticed that when they tried to get me to switch to BCC and keep trying. They did give me the BCC when it split so that saved a few steps. I'm not talking about bitcoin and who's good for it just pointing out not all cloud mining is a scam, and I'm pretty sure 99% of people who go into crypto these days don't know much about it 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:04:35

True but if the price drops to a certain point it will be forced to shut down since it's not profitable, this has been happening with recent price drops
Also if like bitmain shuts down it will hella slow it down, not a shut down but a few companies do have very large influence
