so say I had a computer infected with some sort of malware, Could i still safely use the nano s without said malware discovery important things such as private keys, pins, or the secret phrases?

His bank account is linked to coinbase, coinbase does not have the funds in a wallet. It just accesses the bank account when bitcoins are purchased and then adds the btc to his account in a couple days...
so how long would it take to actually add USD to GDAX?

Thanks! How exactly do you go about the wire transfer?  Do you choose "i'll do it later" after Coinbase gives you that box with the receiving information? Then you head to the bank and give them that information? where do you submit your code coinbase gives you to know the money should be put on your account? Also, will there be an option later on such as "i've sent the funds" after coming back from the bank?
sorry, im new to this.

where do you find this information?

There will be a Coinbase board of directors members present. I believe there is importance in this.

I would love for those questions to be answered as well!
I'm somewhat noob-y regarding crypto so I am not heavily invested but I love to know more.
Seems like it just gets more complicated and confusing the deeper I go.
This is coming from a noob so I don't know how much this matters to you, but I don't think you should let reddit know how much btc you own D: seems risky.

can you generate a 24 word seed for a paper wallet? Can all of this be done offline on a cold storage pc or would you have to connect at some point to generate the seed? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:45:34
oooh i see. and is it safer to create said wallet while booting up a different os on a usb stick? or does that not matter?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:37:28
then educate please
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:42:12
I read that you enter the 25th word after entering your second "secret" pin in order to access that wallet/private key. 
I'm just confused about when I should be creating this second pin and how will the application distinguish between the two wallets when I plug the ledger in
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:29:48
what are the benefits of the nano s? Do you just buy on coinbase and transfer whatever amount you want to the device for safe keeping? If you lose the nano s do you lose all your coins? can you back up somehow?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:05:55
god I really need to learn all this stuff and its so interesting to me. Can I boot up Linux with a usb on mac? 
~~Hopefully this isnt asking too much but if you are really knowledgable on these topics, do you have any links for me to educate myself on these topics?:~~
Would this be a good list to research before diving into actually purchasing the coin on coinbase? :
- how to make sure a device is 100% secure (computer / mobil device) 
- how to boot up linux/another system and why in terms of security
- understand how blockchain / wallets / seed words / pass phrases / public and private keys work

When I try to link my bank account to coinbase it only gives me the option to input my user and password for the bank account, instead of the other deposit verification method I've seen in youtube videos. this is really freaking me out and im not sure if I trust handing out my bank credentials to this site
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:08
Ok thanks so much for the reply this is reassuring. See you at the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:03:21
100% there is no space. Maybe this is because it is a segwit wallet under electrum? and not legacy?
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:14:29
Hypothetically, what if every single wallet that follows BIP39 goes to shit? 
Many wallets advise against exporting your Private Keys in order to maintain security. If BIP39 is somehow corrupted, only the people who stored their private keys would have access to their btc?
Would this mean either a paper wallet be the safest option possible?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:51:01
HERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS SENSEI!:
* what is the safest wallet to use? 
* Should I use a trezor or a ledger nano s? 
* What wallet do you recommend using on a Mac? 
* Why won't coinbase acknowledge my Electrum 3.0 address? 
* Is it possible my address is not verified/online yet? 
* How do I check to verify if an address is real (e.g. my electrum wallet)?

The private keys would first appear on the P-ON ~ doesn't this already render them "hot"? If there was any sort of malware present on the P-ON, wouldn't this render the private keys compromised?
I understand that once the keys are on the P-OFF cold storage wallet, they are now "cold" however, **am I correct to assume that if the private keys where compromised during creation on the P-ON, that they will still be compromised and can transfer funds even when they are located on the P-OFF?**
I still consider myself a noob in regards to cryptocurrency but I understood the first 6 steps you listed. I did not however understand the 3 steps revolving around sending transactions. How exactly are unsigned and signed transactions created? If I open electrum or bitcoin core on the P-ON, the wallet becomes hot. I know i'm completely misunderstanding something in your explanation. Is this what is explained in that wiki link?
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:24:14
How exactly to you generate it offline? The article I read on coindesk said I would need to connect to a certain website to create the address as well as the public and private keys. 
Do you mind listing out some steps that would show the ideal method for creating a secure wallet? Such as 
1. Purchase new laptop (lol)
2. ...
3. ...
In regards to the hardware wallet, what do you mean by special code system? If you use a Ledger nano s, aren’t you worried the facility may have some sneaky methods of generating/storing the seeds (and are able to monitor the seed you created if that is the case)?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:03:33
When I tried to pick "other" it just gave me a search bar to search for my bank, instead of giving me the small deposits option. Have they changed something? Seems like im fk*d and don't know what to do. 
Also, I just checked the bitocin website and it doesnt have Electrum listed as a wallet that will accept the hard fork currency..does this mean I would not get the hard fork currency if I use the Electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:01:59
not using bank credentials anywhere other than your bank is going against bank terms and bank has the right to close your account. ?

so you recommend I link my bank account to coinbase, verify, and just purchase from there? I just checked their subreddit and its full of horror stories. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:48:37
Im talking about verifying my bank account. It is only giving me the instant option where I input my bank credentials. But i dont really trust that and would rather use the small deposits option i've seen in video tutorials 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:05:58
THANK YOU KIND STRANGER! I SHALL TRY
**EDIT:** works
+1 points to you
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:19:28
Thanks! You're a beast at explaining this! Do you have any other recommendation son where to store btc before I purchase a hardwallet such as a nano s? WOuld it be better to keep it on Electrum or find a wallet for my mobile phone? And if you still have time to answer my questions haha, what makes the mobil more secure? 
If youre tired of answering the noob questions just let me know :( thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:34:20
well i was thinking they could hack it and then send the btc to their own wallet D: 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:09:54
what is your source on the 4 days? I just want to be sure because timing is very important at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:27:33
was planning on transferring the funds to GDAX after. (would this take some days or is it instant?) 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:28:53
I get that, but in terms of security (at the moment) banking systems utilizing fiat have been around longer. So in my eyes the probability of that happening is much smaller than the cryto systems. 
My logic could be completely wrong though.

How long does it take to verify bank account. this all seems so difficult just to purchase...like having to worry about coinbase taking your money and not replying for over 2 months seems insane to me. 
everyones excited about bitcoin but i still have no idea how people are purchasing safely..
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:41:36
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:02:13
does this affect anything? why do they keep the standard option available if segwit is lower fees?

absolute noob fking question..but..say I purchase btc on coinbase, then learn how to transfer it to my electrum wallet (btw should I be getting electrum 3.0 somewhere? I keep reading about 3.0 on posts). And now my coins are stored on an address using electrum. Will shitcoins be awarded to me even when my coins are in electrum but i will need to transfer my btc from electrum to another wallet to see the shitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:55:04
When you said


I'm not yet sure how to do this, but I think with some research I can figure out.
Is this how I can determine whether or not what I am downloading is exactly Electrum or Bitcoin Core and nothing more?
If the P-ON is not exactly secure, I would love to know of a way to check the contents on the pendrive (maybe hidden malware that has already spread into the newly downloaded files) before actually plugging the pendrive into the P-OFF
and btw, thanks for the help :)

Are there any 2 step / 2 factor authentication options that send you an SMS or something whenever your account is about to make a purchase? 
Im looking into investing 10k usd but through a DCA plan, but nervous about having that much money connected to coinbase without some sort of 2 step auth.

Got it. Something new to research for me now. Thanks for the quick answer
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:51:24
thank you so much for the help. I really just want to get started with this. So I can make the electrum wallet now, then link my BOA account to coinbase and give my bank credential (it only gives me the option to enter the username and password. No deposit option that i've seen on youtube videos where it takes 4-5 days to verify but seems safer). After that, I can begin purchasing on coinbase? I am looking at investing about $2k before fork and $2k after fork. Would this be ok or am I at risk for coinbase cancelling my account due to improper verification?
I looked at the coinbase subreddit and its full of horror stories and Im just at a loss of what to do
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:45:38
so how should i buy.... all these twists and turns....
