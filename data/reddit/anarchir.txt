I hope our next CEO does a better job with MtGox, our bank.

If you could buy currencies on credit then you'd be able to repeatedly cash out and cash in on reward points and such.
This happened once with a group of people getting rewards for buying dollar coins with free shipping from the U.S. Mint.

You would have resigned, I would have not bought so many shares. I think a lot of us shareholders are still holding them because at this point its not worth anything at all to sell them.

Ahem. You are incorrect. Lots of adults play minecraft. Enough that not only are there minecraft communities dedicated to political groups such as anarchocapitalist economics with hundreds of players but there is even a server that rewards you for playing with weekly btc payouts.

Its amusing to me because they're both incredibly statist areas of the country (overbearing rules and regulations).

Bitcoin is nearly free, Coinbase offers other services above and beyond.

Yeah No. There is no greater nutritional benefit to eating organic over non-organic.
@_date: 2014-09-30 00:35:11
Which is fine. Its offchain transfers, which lessen the burden on the chains network. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:01:19
I agree. Outside of the internet it'll be pockets of communities that accept Bitcoin in the U.S.  Some African and South American countries are much more likely to begin large adoption. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:55:14
I agree. Bitcoin is awesome, but I wont be promoting Yelp.

It might be good for Bitcoins, but its a sad science fair that has something like this win first place. I'm glad the kid is learning these topics, but he could have done a real project, lets be honest here.

I'm confused, Bitcoin can be broken down by many decimal places. Do you use altcoins because you like the whole numbers? 
@_date: 2014-07-05 19:10:08
Really? I bring up the fact that it doesnt support bailouts or war if you stop using government money. Told some Liberals that today. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 00:40:41
Thats hilarious. But of course the local government is a bit different in terms of power compared to the federal level. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:35:53
Does anyone else not have this feature on their Mycelium app? Mine just says [Send] and [Recieve]. Nothing about trading anywhere. Is it because I dont have any bitcoin on that app?

You hit the issue on the nose with "core anarchistic audience". As an anarcho-capitalist voluntaryist myself, I know that I and others like me will always have a use for Bitcoin. Price is irrelevant.

You're absolutely wrong about the selfishness.  Thats not debatable.
If one person uses a gun to take my money against my will, thats theft.
If two people do so together, still theft.
If one person gives a gun to someone else and pays them to take my money, also theft.
If two people do so, still theft.
Why is it that when its lots of people taking lots of peoples money, its not theft?

I'd have reached 2 bitcoins by now, but I keep buying stuff with them and now I'm getting into HavelockInvestments.com. Gotta keep growing the bit-economy!

Yo! We need more bitcoin in Wisconsin.

Its always like that. I notice listening to NPR that if I know a decent amount about a topic they're way off on it more often than not. I just stopped listening to the news now and only listen to This American Life where they interview people to tell stories. It doesnt matter if storytime is bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:14:17
I'd bet the reason why your post is down voted is because you just donated a nearly insignificant amount of money. This is truly an issue of switching to bits. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:21:26
You have no use for bitcoin, and the network has no use for you. Do your research. This isnt a get rich quick scheme its a new economy and new currency.

1. What is the point of a CFO if they never touched any Bitcoins? We should have been told about these problems much earlier so something could be done and pressure could be placed on Danny.
2. Dannys consistent remarks about his own bitcoin alongside Neo &amp; Bee's definitely makes it seem like he was embezzling the money this whole time. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:43:30

I hit up 12 garage sales today. Unfortunately I only spent $1. These sales arent what they used to be. No video games, knives, oddities, cool books, fun electronics like when I was a kid. Its all furniture too large for my car, baby clothes, and Christmas junk.

This thread makes me so happy. That we finally have an alt-economy starting up, and it totally has its roots firmly planted in anti-government sentiment. Bitcoin has done more for the anti-war movement than any protesters ever have.
@_date: 2014-03-31 09:17:39
If you're in Bitcoin in order to speculate and raise the amount of government money you have, you're in it for the wrong reasons.
Bitcoin exists so you can exchange goods and services with a decentralized currency. Use it as such: buy stuff and sell stuff with bitcoin.

What if you dont have money now but rather receive regular paychecks? Buying regularly means you purchase what you can, when you can. If you wait until you have one lump sum it might be too expensive.

I've tried talking with activists about it. As in, people who are proud of how much they pay attention to the world news and get active in it.
They still ask me about the damn suicide (which I know nothing about really, because it is completely a non-issue).
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:38:19
We should really be targeting specific celebrities with our tipping. It will probably appeal to those who are more libertarian like Penn Jillette, politically active about the economics of less wealthy countries (Matt Damon), etc.

Except we'd still want to send money to each other and would just jump to litecoin or another altcoin. 
Also .00001 bitcoins is as useful as 1 whole bitcoin.

Its great to see all these businesses pulling together in promotion of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:47:22
Its a way that you can have an online wallet to tip other users some money on Reddit. There are tipbots for various cryptocoins and some have fun gimmicks like rolling dice to determine amounts tipped or tipping specific amounts such as the price of a coffee. 
I'd give you a tip so you can see but I'm fresh out. Its a useful feature because you can go into other subreddits and tip users like who post helpful or insightful information. They get some money, you get to spread the idea of Bitcoin in a positive and eye opening way. 
My favorite use of it is to tip to charities like Seans Outpost.

@_date: 2015-01-17 18:58:13
Totally unrelated, but at one point Julian Assange created a "rubber hose" software so that when you were forced to give up a password you could give up a fake one that still looked like it worked.

It really isnt an issue anymore for me since I added my current product on there, but thank you for your quick response!
More specifically, the issue was starting on this page:
Then clicking [Add New Item]. 
I can add an item, save it, and use the html code. I then have to go back to the catalog list and do that process again for the next item. It should be able to let me just add another item without going back.

@_date: 2012-11-08 17:24:50
Yeah I suppose if enough people decided to abandon it at once it could lose a lot of value, but at this point could it really collapse? There are so many merchants out there who would accept it as payment. I myself am adding Bitcoin to my business today, if someone wanted to unload all their coins they could do so in an instant.

I'd probably be alright at that job, not in that field though. 
Whats worse is the computer system is in every room all over the hospital, and patients have long periods of time alone with them. What a terrible idea to not have a secure password! I literally tried "doctor", then "nurse" for passwords. Way too simple.

An overly positive and un-critiquing mentality does seem to be a problem sometimes with these sorts of investing forums. I've seen it at forums.silverseek and realcent.org as well. Bitcoin has had some corrections and business failures so far and thus we are lucky to be a little bit more wary.
@_date: 2013-01-24 03:45:52
From my casual observations of Bitcoin I'd say that the main problem is that people are hoarding more than spending. I think this will be solved in time, but ultimately we need people to keep engaging in transactions.
I'm working on a few Agorist books that'll I'll earn bitcoin from I believe, so I think I'll get some that way. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:41:18
Probably. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:46:03
Thank you so much! I know I'm not alone in being super happy for this change. I had discussed with my significant other buying $10 a week into BTC, but never even got to use the reoccurring buy because it immediately was too little. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:20:47
That is true, but I want Bitcoin to be a currency not some stock to buy and sell. I want people to more and more accept it for goods and services. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:59:51
That Satoshi is great? Sure, why not. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 05:01:57
Quite some time ago on Civcraft a few people were selling diamonds (ingame) for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:57:07
So this has happened in Sudan now, I believe in Cyprus as well. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:08:14
Yeah I have no idea why they think bitcoin is a female thing. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:05:40
I feel and act the same way.

Bought some Bitcoin Magazine issues! Woo.

I did a lot of christmas shopping this year with overstock and bitcoin. It worked out great.

Banks: Get too much business, have to shut down services.
What other business works like this? 
@_date: 2013-10-13 05:20:23
Yeaah I wouldnt say Bitcoin crashed at all due to TSR. After Bitcoin hit 200 it did crash a bit, but it really didnt do much recently. Silver did a similar pattern, getting up to 50 and then its been slowly falling and levelling out. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:58:22
I havent been able to afford any, busy moving and finding better work. I've been watching this forum and just enjoying watching an alternative currency do well.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:38:38
They are all just arbitrary numbers. It is tough for an individual to put a value on a single BTC. The marketplace as a whole can handle it.
@_date: 2013-01-24 02:47:39
Thats ultimately why I stayed out so long: Bitcoins from the start have been a bit iffy for me. Also why I never bought any shire silver cards: way too sketchy. The people running it are nice, but I can see it being too risky.
Silver bullion, now that's my thing.
@_date: 2013-09-26 03:19:18
Keep up the good work Mandrik. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 01:12:12
So did I. Im thinking about selling some of my silver for bitcoin. Not sure if its worth it though. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:40:07
Deleting this. Waiting 20 minutes and it didnt go up, post on reddit, then it fucking works. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:30:30
I think people might wish to take the strategy of [dollar cost averaging]( This system is a way of purchasing bitcoins, I've used it for silver. What you do is periodically, say every paycheck or every month buy the same amount of bitcoin. You will not be impulse buying in a frenzy this way, will only spend what you can afford, and you will avoid swings by buying at the -average- of all your purchases. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:39:03
I'm a Coinbase user. I know a lot of people complain about you and dont understand, but really you're doing a great job. Keep it up!

Ladies just aren't generally into politics. Bitcoin is still largely political.

No fucking way.

It actually is. I talked to a coworker about btc, he was going to buy some, then spotted the price and got sticker shock. I had to specifically let him know that he could get fractions. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:49:58
Same here. I might be down a bit on silver, but diversifying is not a problem. I have been thinking about selling some of my silver for more BTC however. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:30:38
or this: 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:43:17
It is centralized, uses USD, and seems to be capitalizing on Bitcoin's success.

I managed to log into a computer in a doctors office at a major hospital once some years ago. The password was "nurse". Got it on the second try. I logged off immediately, but still, not a smart move on their part. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 07:40:20
Yes! I had a similar incident the other day. I just wanted to start up a savings account. It took forever, they gave me a checking account instead, imposed restrictions, made me sign tons of paperwork, etc etc. 
The whole time I kept thinking it would be faster and easier if I did it with bitcoin, and I wouldnt need to involve a stupid middleman. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:15:25
Bitstamp is closing down though isnt it? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:50:20
Same here, trying to get litecoins at the same time. Ive decided the easiest way is going to be just going with coinbase and crossing my fingers.

Absolutely true. Both are excellent news for bitcoin however. Anything that prevents USD usage.

Its a chat right? How do you make money from it?
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:29:56
I've made this mistake several times. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:35:12
Exactly!

"more nutritional value"
Source? And technically GMO should taste better, because you can change the makeup of the plant specifically so it tastes better. What you might think tastes better is if the plant is fresh. Many grocery stores pick items under-ripe so they can ripen on the shelves, which sucks. Picking it closer to peak ripeness is much more flavorful. 
@_date: 2013-01-22 20:01:00
I should probably get around to actually buying some bitcoins huh? I finally have some $$. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:43:23
It has happened to me, exactly, every time. Should I be worried? I feel like I should be ripped off in some way, but I'm not. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:22:19
I dont see any BTC buttons on your site!

There are a few graphic design/critique subreddits you might want to post this to. My thoughts:
You're competing with TSR, make sure you state your benefits over that site (not dark web, etc?) and other sites. There are other auction BTC sites, you should promote why yours is different.
You need a thumbnail still.
Obviously your site isnt finished, content needs to be fleshed out. Paragraphs are unfinished, "click here" has nothing there. The entire part that says "Home" can be deleted, it serves no purpose. 
Your listings have errors in design. For instance, clicking on Books makes some tabs look funny. I couldnt get imgur to work, but heres some examples:
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:19:40
Yeah that site looks terrible.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:34:34
For me if I bought 1BTC at $100 then even if the price jumps up to $200 when my coin comes in I'll have paid $100 for one BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:40:16
Because of how easy I know banking is now from Bitcoin, I make the teller at my bank fill out my deposit slip for me every damn time. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:23:54
Yes, technically I could wait and it'll keep gaining value. But I want the Bitcoin economy to succeed more than I want to make a personal profit.

This site has been around for years. I'm happy to see this addition.

Was checking it every hour or so at work this evening, couldnt comprehend what I was looking at in my app. I thought I must have remembered what the price was all wrong because the numbers I were seeing were so unexpected.

Couldnt spot it again. The post is well buried now, and the comment surely as well. It was on however. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:15:34
Yep. A rally. Bubble means it is far overpriced and will "pop" to a much lower level. Rally means it is expected to rise quickly. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:18:06
Thank you, I'll look into that.

Thats what I'm thinking, it might just be easier to start selling possessions.

What is the best way to buy in your opinion? Send BTC to BTC-E then trade for LTC? I have a Litecoin wallet with .2LTC, but it is 108 weeks out of sync and I assume it'd take forever to be usable again.

Thats what I keep trying to explain to people. Dont dump bitcoins to get USD. We're trying to transfer currencies here from any currency into bitcoin: thats the whole point of bitcoin.

They posted in a thread above, its fixed now! Smaller buy amounts (I'm not sure what size).

I bet you got a TON of recruits to bitcoin. Has the subscribers to this subreddit gone up?

The last time I tried giving a homeless man food I had bought a meal just for him. He refused it entirely but accepted a bottle of water. Wtf.

I am trying to incorporate it more into my life as a currency. When it goes up it is an encouragement to spend it because it is like buying items for free. 
@_date: 2013-01-24 18:27:08
On an individual level, sure, nothing wrong with hoarding. For a currency that is trying to gain widespread acceptance it is more beneficial for its users to keep spending them. Most of the money you earn from your job is spent, right?  We should be paying our bills with bitcoin.
