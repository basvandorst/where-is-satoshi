Why would anyone want volatility in their currency?  Rich or poor?

[Why don't you ask ISIS why they use bitcoin to fund themselves?](

And you left out the keywords!
"This could be a one-off fundraising effort, admits Wulkan, **or even — possibly although very unlikely, he says — a hoax or a joke**. But it could also be pointing to a larger, more worrying trend."
What does "very unlikely was a hoax" mean to you?
If you actually read the article you would have found later:
**a pro-ISIS blog titled “Bitcoin and the Charity of Violent Physical Struggle**
The article points out that the only way for someone in a developed country (ie using bank accounts) could transfer money to say terrorists, would be via Bitcoin, since banks/governments have the means to watch and prevent such wire transfers in a banking system.  Remember the selling point of bitcoin, banking without a middle man!  Which is why it facilitates money laundering and getting money to  . . nefarious individuals.  How do you not understand this?
Let me ask you a question.  What do you think bitcoin was predominately being used to pay for from 2009 to 2013?
Do you think Silk Road was selling bath towels and socks?  
I also like how you ask for someone to throw an explanation out there, receive it, don't read it, and then go, "where is the evidence!  I can't find it!"

Gold is highly illiquid, which is not a trait of money.  I can't walk into 7-11 and slice off a piece of bullion to pay for my slushie.

It points to the COIN etf as a volatility reducer, except that ETF is nowhere close to being accepted.  The fundamental flaw with their "application" is that the mechanism for creation/redemption is dependent on unregulated bitcoin exchanges (in sketchy places like romania . . ) - something the SEC no doubt sees as a major red flag.  The frequent collapse/hacking of bitcoin exchanges doesn't bode well.
The whole reason they're creating their Gemini exchange (a regulated exchange in the US) is it helps strengthen the trust in the ability for their trust to operate their ETF effectively and reliably.  However, despite this addition (and its a ways off), I really don't see the SEC approving the ETF.

But you are describing boom or bust as the only possible endings.  And you equate not being worthless to it therefore will take over someday.  What about the scenario where bitcoin adoption stagnates, never disappears, but never takes the market share people in this subreddit expect or its cap remains muted forever, but again, not zero.
This binary view of the eventual outcome ignores a myriad of scenarios that are much more likely.

For every drug sale on Silk Road, Ulbricht takes a percentage of the transaction value.  He also had relations with the largest drug dealers and would converse regularly with them.  Not to mention the site started with him just selling shrooms.

Have you looked at the sources and footnotes in that?  There isn't a single academic research paper referenced.  It's just anonymous internet pages and a whole slew of "Personal Correspondence &lt;date&gt;" as his "information".  Disregarding the content, citing "personal correspondence" as a viable information source is laughable in the non-fiction world.  It's a seriously unprofessional book you just sourced.

So you are admitting bitcoin is not better than every other currency system/payment method in the market?


6 years in, 2/3 of all coins mined, and bitcoin is still waiting for the starting gun to go off?  You think this is a healthy sign?

Average tps for Visa yes, but there system has been stressed repeatedly to see if it can maintain 20,000 tps for days.  It can.  It's been able to do so for years.  Obviously, 45,000 is an exaggeration but being able to process 20K transactions without hiccup is leagues better than bitcoin's current ability.

Paypal's revenue is more than twice the market cap of btc and it has 13,000 employees.  You really think there are that many employees in the bitcoin industry?  Coinbase has &lt;15.
