Right.. How is your mindset going to be if your money is suddenly worth half of what it was yesterday?

You set up an account with a broker. As far as learning *how* to trade, there is a wealth of resources online. Personally I learned through iMarketsLive. 
If you can learn to make money on the exchange then don’t let taxes stop you.

But that’s what investments are. A place to store your money. Most investments we hope will grow, but we know they also have the capacity to shrink. 
I think storing all your money in the most volatile commodity on earth is absolutely ridiculous. I believe you are doing it early enough that you are still an “early adopter” and if you can ride out the time then I don’t see why you couldn’t grow your wealth that way. But if it’s growing or shrinking your money then it’s an investment. 
So let’s say in 10 years your wealth has hyperinflated because BTC is $50k a coin. Does your lifestyle change at all? Are you buying more space to live in, a new car, better food? Because if the fluctuation in BTC is going to affect your life at all, it’s an **investment**. A savings account is an investment. You’re investing in security and insurance of your dollar. 
$50k per coin sounds nice but would you be fine with the price falling to $2k a coin? What if it remained there for an entire year?

Honest answer? NO.
But of course, also, **it depends**. Does this stock comprise 10% or less of our portfolio? Or the more likely, is this stock 100% of our portfolio?
If our entire holdings is in a single stock then we **do** need to diversify. If our stock is merely a small percentage of our portfolio, then obviously that stock must be underperforming if we are considering selling and we then maybe we should sell it off to place in other investments. 
But let’s assume this is our whole life savings in one stock. We’re basically gambling if we’re hoping for any serious returns, and if there are dividends they are surely but a handful of change at the end of the year. 
So what **should** we do? Again this stock is 100% of our portfolio. 
Liquify the tech stock, place $6k in an ETF, and learn how to trade forex and crypto. Demo trade the markets until you can consistently produce pips, **then** enter the exchanges with your remaining $4k. 
Profit. 
Don’t spend a dime on BTC at these prices if you’re looking to *invest*. The price will come back down eventually. If you spend your hard-earned money on BTC right now then you will watch the price fluctuate on a daily basis and lose your damn mind. And more importantly, lose your $10k
