The bank most certainly gets an extortionate amount of money. The car dealer gets the principal while the bank gets the wonderful thing we call interest.

You violate a very important function of money if you expect money to 'soar' and that is the third rule: standard unit of accounting. It becomes very difficult for a populace to use something as money when it's value is completely arbitrarily determined by supply and demand and is seen as investment in itself rather than just a vehicle for investment, this is actually a problem that fiat has but is "fixed" by pegging the currency to another more stable currency (like the dollar, or before that, gold).

Debt should not be used as collateral because it is an immaterial asset. Unfortunately, those working at the central bank are unconvinced of this. Hence: fractional reserve banking.
All banks in the US are obligated to deposit some amount of money in the federal reserve, this is called the primary reserve. The US department of treasury then prints some more money based on the judgment of the monetary policy committee of the federal reserve system that is then collateralized by the deposited money (primary reserve). Only problem? Primary reserve &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; circulating money.

Egypt, Lebanon, and former Syria were more open about women and hair and some other aspects. Nowadays I think UAE is becoming more open and so is Saudi (they let women drive recently)

The whole point of having bitcoin/a system better than Bitcoin based on blockchain and crypto is so that the banks no longer have a monopoly on money

That's not what the algorithm is designed to protect in the first place. The algorithm being referenced here is the bitcoin protocol, Which allows all of the transactions on the network to be stored in an immutable, distributed, peer-verified ledger.
The "Price" of bitcoin is subject to manipulation because we are treating it like a commodity even though everything about it opposes all current financial and economic systems in place. Which allows for misinformation to spread like wildfire. Bitcoin shouldn't have a price in the first place. That's the equivalent of asking what the price of $1 is.
No government has ever regulated a good or service without attaching a punishment for unregulated behavior. So the method of regulation is negative reinforcement. Whereas with the bitcoin algorithm, the network is regulated by design. In order for any entry to be accepted in the Blockchain it must obey the rules set out by the protocol. To confirm that it obeys the rules, mining takes place to verify these transactions and then log them into the Blockchain irreversibly. 
If that isn't regulation, I don't know what is.

That has very little to do with the technology of bitcoin and a lot more to do with the way its treated like a stock market.

Higher mining difficulty doesn't mean the network is more secure. The difficulty is adjusted so that on average it takes 10 minutes to mine a new block.

You can't mine old coins?

The way it works is that a 2% annual fee on a 6% annual return works out to a 4% annual return. So imagining a $1000 dollar investment for 20 years:
no annual fee: $1000 x (1+6%)^20 = $3207
annual fee: $1000 x (1+4%)^20 = $2191
a difference of ~$1015 or 31.6%

Bitcoin is not the right investment for that.

Again you're treating crypto like the product and not the medium.
