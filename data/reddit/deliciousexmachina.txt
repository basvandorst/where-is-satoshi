What kind of *fucking psychics* are they going to have at the crossings who can tell if I've memorized my recovery phrase?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:25:08
Well they sure as fuck aren't going to find any after, so...
Fuck, man. Here I am already talking like a criminal, and I haven't even *done* anything.

Unless they edited to correct after the fact, it looks like they were referring to Litecoin Cash (of *course* that's a thing), which (for whatever reason) *does* use SHA-256.

Remember how excited everyone was when they announced that it was going to... oh. Right.

2 weeks to do a 3 minute network send? That's ridiculous!
Was that a typical wait for withdrawals from them, or just a product of their... liquidity issues?

*You* know that Classic and BTC are different things, *I* know it, anyone reading this comment chain knows it, but how many folks do you think read that story today and just assumed that "Bitcoin Classic" meant "The Bitcoin from before all the forks"?

Here's another good question: If he's going to become so unhinged over one person referring to the coin by a different name, how is he going to react when someone wants to make *literally any meaningful change* that he disagrees with?

The thing is, there *is* a coin whose devs are jumping ship in favor of BCH, but that's Bitcoin Classic, which (unless you've looked it up, and especially given the recent fork drama) sounds like just another way to refer to BTC. 
My guess is that folks read about Classic shutting down, got BTC and Classic confused, and jumped ship to BCH.

Of course not, why would they be?
It's an early Christmas for them, just so long as everyone else stays misinformed.

Yeah man, Bitcoin's .19% (not a typo, that's actually a fifth of a percent) of total worldwide energy consumption must be *devastating*.
But hey, on the bright side: If we can manage to bump the usage up another 30 TWh/year from its peak, we'll just about be caught up to the banking system!
