Ideas are EASY. Execution is HARD.
Why do you need to cross-platform? Why not just write the app for a web browser, optimized for mobile, but workable on a desktop?
I am sure there are good reasons, but none will outweigh the advantages of getting to market sooner especially given the limited resources you have.
Better do just ONE thing REALLY WELL and get it out there, than to wait for all the 'bells and whistles' be ready. Heck, your customers may not even want those and you won't know for certain until you have customers.

While I agree that it is generally accepted that customer support operates during business hours, this is the wrong approach. Why? People generally work during business hours and are too busy working, to make personal calls. This assumes of course their job even allows for personal calls to be made.
If your customers want to call at 2:00AM on a Sunday, and you want to serve your customers - well then get someone to answer the phone at 2:00AM on a Sunday. It is that simple.

@_date: 2015-06-13 13:26:11
Exactly correct. Also, even if they were to make Bitcoin their national currency, it still needs to be purchased - and what currency would they use to do that?
This is why Bitcoin must displace fiat in a given market over time, until it reaches the point where it has replaced fiat. It can't be done 'all at once'.

Sure - you need 1,000 Dash coins to run a master node. But currently master nodes are paid approx 0.5 Dash per day. It works out to about a 18% return annually. That is an excellent way to encourage people to run master nodes.
I believe the coins are also required to support Darksend. Not sure about that though.

You pay in traditional ways - or Bitcoin. Not sure if the supplier can receive in Bitcoin though.
It can be a bit 'hit and miss' finding a good Fiverr person, but when you do, treat them like GOLD and you'll be all set.
I find it is OK to 'go on the cheap' to find good Fiverr people, but once you are happy with someone - just remember that you paying a large percentage more is still peanuts to you, and HUGE money for them. That will buy you lots of respect, high priority service, very fast response, excellent work, and a long time relationship, while still not costing much compared to Western income levels.
Having said that - sometimes paying more doesn't work. Not sure why. But I find when it does, I can just concentrate on getting the job done and moving the project forward fast instead of tons of back and forth and delays. In the end - that saves you much more than the extra you pay compared to what they would have accepted.
Depending on the amount of Data Entry work you have, it may be a good idea to have more than 1 Fiverr person working for you. Then if one relationship goes bad, you can work with the other(s) until you find a new Fiverr person.

Apparently, RBC in Canada has a USD bank account for Canadians, that exists in the USA. (So, NOT a USD account in Canada) Technically it is a 'virtual' account, because there is no USA branch you can visit, but it is a 'real' USA bank account in every other way. As such, Circle should work with it. I do not know this personally - but read it on another thread. The account is not described on their website, but if you call, they can tell you about it. Of course, you can transfer to/from it online to/from your USA/CDN RBC accounts based in Canada.

Agreed. But, what would be a better metric to compare against? It would have to be a non-fiat item, that is not subject to any government control, and that is globally standardized and understood. Therefore, it can't be gold, oil, bread or housing. That only leaves virtual currency, and for obvious reasons it can't be Bitcoin itself.
So, since Bitcoin is the 'defacto' standard, other virtual currencies could give a 'worth' based on the exchange rate to Bitcoin, but what about Bitcoin itself?
I agree the problem you identify it valid and real. However, that problem is a huge part of the reason Bitcoin is succeeding, and it will be the solution to that problem for valuing anything else - just not Bitcoin itself.

Well - when you create paper wallets, you often create multiple, including many that are intended to be empty for a long time. For example, when you move the cold storage amount to hot, and only SOME of the amount, you need a new change address that is cold storage again.

Well, I guess it depends on the definition of 'can' and 'operation'. Because if you are lucky, then you only need 3. This assumes that the fake is 1 of the 3.
However, if the question is the least number of operations that will guarantee the fake is identified, it is 4.
Now, if an 'operation' means weighing, you could put 2 bars at once, on each side of the scale. If they balance, and 'can' means minimum without a guarantee, you are done in ONE operation.
etc. etc.

It gets worse. I have had to send wire transfers many times before. The form at the bank uses ambiguous terminology, which makes it error prone. Once, they returned the funds, stating there was an error on the form - but could not tell me what the error was due to security reasons! The teller and I went over the form multiple times, and then decided to send it through again, with the exact same information. It went through fine that time. Of course they tried to charge me a second time, and since I had both copies, I could prove that what ever the screw up was - it wasn't mine. They never agreed it was their mistake and ended up 'eating' the cost as a favor to me! I then had to explain that not admitting their mistake wasn't a favor, and just made me more angry. Idiots.

Tyson has stated that we would be ignorant to think that there is no other life in the universe, since there are SO MANY other planets. However, we have no idea what the odds are that life can form, and that could be MANY MANY MANY orders of magnitude greater than the number of planets. Therefore, it is not ignorant to think there is no other life in the universe. It is ignorant to say there **must** be other life, when we simply do not know. That makes Tyson ignorant.

This is a great idea. I had the same thought recently too. I was thinking that our small town could eliminate a LOT of corruption if they adopted Bitcoin. I approached my town counselor and asked what he would need in terms of community or industry support, to run a single small construction project as a pilot, with Bitcoin payments only. The idea being that the public would be told the spending address (City), and then receiving addresses (Contractors) so they could watch what is actually spent.
The answer I got, is that he suspected that the Banks that finance much of what the city does, would pull back causing major problems. I countered with the fact that Bitcoin would remove corruption, and therefore DROP the costs dramatically, and then the city would likely not need the banks!
People and organizations resist change. So, the only way this will work is if you start SMALL and help it grow.

Did you ever get your order? I have been waiting for 2 months. Some communication, but I no longer believe their statements. I don't think they are a large company at all. I bet it is a 'one man show' and he has a 'day job'.
My order  on March 5 never arrived and was canceled. The new order  on April 21 has not arrived either.
Note that works out to 1812 - 1791 = 21 orders in 47 days = just over 3 orders per week. Small change - VERY small.
So, I doubt it is a 'scam'. Not enough orders. But, more likely they are having other technical issues and are making excuses. They would be better to hand off the business to someone who can make it work, or close down.

Trivia fact - the guys that started HotMail were friends from school and worked in the same area. They met at lunch often, and took turns literally bringing an idea to the table. The other's job was to KILL the idea during that lunch meeting. If it wasn't killed, only THEN did they start a business plan. Even then, the business plan was for THEM, and not for a bank. Often, the numbers in the business plan killed the idea, or they were just not good enough.
This practice made them smart enough to instantly know their HotMail.com idea was a killer app. So, they immediately went into 'stealth' mode.
I heard when it came time to sell to Microsoft, they named their price, and their high-end business lawyer said if they got that price, he would put a bronze statue of them in his foyer. Guess what - its there. (My Google-Fu is not finding a citation. Maybe someone can find it?)

Then, once you've figured out how to eliminate/minimize those, find $3-$5K and get a site developed, but do NOT try to 'do it all'. Keep it extremely simple - leave 'advanced features' for later. You goal should be to get your first 10 clients. LISTEN to them. Make changes. Market, market, market. Rinse and repeat.

Yep. Once I had waterfront property and wanted to create a 'dry' boat slip. No permit was needed, because I was not changing the shore line. I was just removing dirt leading up to it, to get down to the bedrock. We wanted to leave it natural since the bedrock was big 'sheets' anyways.
Problem was, many years ago, they apparently tried to build a shore well, so the bedrock there was all blasted into gravel, and we didn't know. That meant it kept getting weedy and gross with decaying leaves etc.
So, we decided to pour a concrete pad. Note that this is all ABOVE the water line.
Guess what - they forced me to 'replace' the fish habitat I was 'destroying'.

OK. I remember reviewing QuickBT before. I have 2 issues.
* The amount is limited to 0.12 BTC. We are aiming for a price point of $100 so that becomes a problem when BTC is below $835.
* The interface expects them to enter the BTC amount, and we want them to enter the  $USD amount.
I realize the second point is 'anti-Bitcoin', and we want to price in BTC as soon as possible, but the idea is to make it as transparent to the end user as we can.

Indirectly yes. In the past, I just used Debian. Done. I am a techie, so it was fine. But I tried Linux Mint and was pleasantly surprised when my young son (this was a few years ago - he was 5 or 6.) was able to 'drive' it. Same for others. It was powering my big screen TV at the time, so familiarity for others was important.   Family and friends new it wasn't Windows XP, but felt it was a lot the same. I ended up just sticking with it and now use LMDE on my development computer too.
@_date: 2015-08-22 20:51:28
If you are trying to 'time' it like this, you must be buying in order to HODL. If you were buying to spend, you would not care so much.
Why do you want to HODL? Is it because you think it will go to $300? $400? $1,000?
What happens when you miss trying to pick the bottom, and after hitting $230, it bounces up to $300 or more? I'll tell you what - you will be PISSED you didn't buy it at $230.
Don't try and pick bottoms. It is extremely unlikely you will be successful. Better to just buy on dips, and HODL.
When it is at a much higher price years from now, you won't care you paid $200 or $230. You'll just be glad you have some.

Both - you need patience and to support the ecosystem.
It is OK to hodl your coins, but when spending fiat, ALWAYS ask yourself if you can pay with BTC instead. Then buy new coins just for that transaction. That way, your hodl coins are not touched.
I do this from Canada using AnyCoinDirect.eu. I just enter the payment address for the vendor, so the coins go directly to them, without me needing to get involved. I pay for the coins using Interac, just like as if I was paying a utility bill.

Absolutely. Compounding those returns we get:

It is late. Maybe I got the math wrong. But, it is indeed a scam.

Are you sure? Maybe you only need to know most, and demonstrate you can figure out the rest yourself.

Learn what BIP38 is, and use it. Then even if someone sees your private key, it is useless to them without the password. Then you can make digital copies of your offline private address and store them in multiple places. I would still print it out and store that copy in a safe place.
@_date: 2015-08-04 00:17:05
Here is what they need to do if they want more units.
* Start with 1 BTC.
* Divide by 10 and you now have 0.1 BTC and 10 times the units!
* Divide by 10 again and you have 0.01BTC and 100 times the units!
* Rinse and Repeat until you are happy.

Correct me if I am wrong - but it will still be obvious to my ISP with your service, that I am querying those specific 'watch only' addresses. In turn, that means the NSA etc can track it too and link it to me.
I am thinking that if I install a full node, and run a webserver on that same LAN, (but separate guest) then I can tunnel to that webserver over SSH, and no one will know I am querrying those addresses, because it will be direct to the node on the LAN.

I think given the feedback I received on my apparently failed logic, this is the only possible outcome.
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:12:03
By 'entire process' I believe you are referring to the database. No, MVC does not require that the DB is on the same machine. Heck - MVC is not even always server side. MVC is often purely on the client side when writing Javascript. So, obviously the database is not on the same server then.
Regardless, I don't know of any 'framework' that dictates that the database be on the same server. Sure - it may be 'standard practice' to have the DB local, and maybe difficult to setup remote, but it is simply a configuration issue to have it on a separate server.
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:22:50
Er - OK. I just figured that the odds of a public address having that many sequential 1's, is pretty much impossible to do by chance. Therefore, if someone can figure out the logic, they can easily write a script to go in reverse.
Are you saying that is not a vanity address?
[Edit: Following  added.] Looks like it is REALLY hard. See 'Difficulty of finding a vanity' [here]( for an idea. So, someone made up the public address and is 'burning' BTC for some reason.

I had a similar experience with CryptoCards.co.
You can try  They don't currently offer Bitcoin specific cards, but when emailing them they seemed very open to doing that.
I am starting to think that there is a 'bigger' reason that these services are shutting down.
Obviously, you need to send them BIP 38 private keys. Unless you take serious steps to make sure the password is indeed random, and strong, someone will be able to hack your wallet. This is exactly why BrainWallet.org went permanently offline after a presentation at the recent DefCon.
Browse through [this PDF]( and then seriously question if you want to use BIP 38 for something you send to a 3rd party. (For added protection in case of theft - it is great. For sending online - not at all.)

Far less than with current/traditional financial networks.
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:08:36
The general answer is 'No'. This is because they don't have access to exchanges, and they have no available money to spend on it. Also, even if they could get some, there is almost no one accepting it there, so they could not spend it.
Still, I think there is a huge opportunity in Greece to promote Bitcoin. It would need to be some sort of very narrow use case. Like buying a coffee for every Greek adult. Huge logistic problems with that, and the cafe's would need to be able to purchase their supplies with Bitcoin etc. Then there is the fact it would immediately become obvious the cafe's are violating capital controls and run into legal issues.
I guess where I am going with this, is if there is a way to expose many Greek people to Bitcoin now, even if they can only use it for a single small purchase, then as soon as they do have access to their savings ...... to the moon!

It depends on the scenario.
If someone has:
* BIP38 Private Key. (If you sent this to a company - they have it.)
* Public address. (They won't know which one - but it will be on the block chain.)
* Cracker tools like described above.
Then you've got pretty much the exact scenario as described at DefCon.

However, I triggered a scenario where a bunch of people sent Bitcoin to a Greek restaurant, to buy free deserts/meals etc for people who demonstrate they are willing to learn about Bitcoin. So, that is a small scale trade of services for Bitcoin - no fiat involved.
On a larger scale, there are services popping up, where they will help you handle much larger amounts without banks. They 'buy' your receivables for Bitcoin. They are targeting Greece right now.
It will happen in many small steps, but it will happen. That's why they are afraid.

Has to be a vanity address. AFAIK, the last 6 characters are separate from the private key and are used for something else.

If you read through, you will see he is getting LOTS of tips. This will help educate Greeks about Bitcoin.
Send Nikos a ChangeTip and suggest how he spend it. Typically, you suggest to pay for a desert etc., and it looks like he plans to get pictures and post them back. To receive the free desert etc., the customer needs to show they have a Bitcoin wallet on their phone.

I would focus on letting them know it is FREE and EASY to setup a changetip account, and also let them know how they can exchange the Bitcoin to fiat if they want to. Someone else posted that this is possible - there are exchanges in Greece. Just not common. Someone PM'd me about [BTCGreece.com]( and mentioned that since they would only be moving fiat from one Greek bank account to another, capital controls should not be an issue.

* Boot Tails from DVD, so you don't even have to wipe the OS from the hard drive. (Although I would.)
* By default, WiFi is off on Tails I think. Even if the WiFi is on, it can't connect unless you give it a password.
* Pull the BitAddress.org code from GitHub and save it to a USB stick. So many eyes are on that code set, it is safe.
* Not sure what vector malware on a USB would use if you are not online. Maybe it could cripple your RNG? Maybe someone else can chime in on that one.

I'm thinking we need to start REALLY small. Also, do it in a way that has very little friction. Dead easy for us to send a ChangeTip. If the Cafe has a ChangeTip account, they don't need to worry about a Point of Sale system for Bitcoin yet. The owner can just know there is $X in the account, so for the next hour/day/week he can safely offer free coffee and his costs are covered.
So, if you can get a Cafe to setup a ChangeTip account, and post it on their website, that's all we need to do at this point.

Sure - anything that affects the price is important. But, I am just trying to isolate the 'fundamentals' of Bitcoin.
Think of it this way, if Warren Buffet say he is going to buy lots of Coke stock, that is going to bump up the price. But, if we only look at the earnings per share, we get a more fundamental view.

They don't get it do they. Not surprised.
My action was trivial in a way - I bought desert for some anonymous Greek person at a restaurant there, while sipping my morning coffee in Ontario Canada.
But, in another way - it was oblivious to their 'capital controls', cost almost zero fees, and was instant. THAT is NOT trivial.
They are laughing because it is the only way they know how to react to their FEAR.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:50:59
You need to get pictures of the people eating their free deserts and put that on Facebook and Twitter etc. mentioning that it was paid for with Bitcoin from outside Greece!
That will get you more business because people will hope they get a free desert too.

Be careful. Some  registrars sell WHOIS Guard service that can easily be bypassed with a few mouse clicks. They do this because the law states they must provide the WHOIS info. So, they just make it harder. Other registrars only show THEIR info. This is legal for them because in the fine print, when you purchase their WHOIS Guard, you are effectively selling your domain to THEM. This is fine, if you trust they will give it back to you later when you cancel the WHOID Guard. Also, hopefully they do not terminate it when given a Cease and Desist letter etc.
So, which solution is up to you and depends on the site purpose I guess. Either way - I would use fake info in the Domain Registration.

Or, use any one of [these graphs]( but starting with the dollar purchasing power of today on the far left, and take a guess where we will be in 5 years after an economic collapse.

You may want to clarify that on your site. Currently it simply states;

*KeepKey must be used in conjunction with supported computer clients. At this time, KeepKey works with our Chrome extension as well as Electrum and Multibit.*

They are selling 44,000 coins? That is roughly 1/3 the monthly volume created by miners, let alone what is exchanged on the market. Would buying that many on an exchange impact the price? Absolutely. But this is going to be off an exchange and likely purchased by someone who wants to avoid exactly that - a price run up during their buy. I don't think it will impact the price much at all.

There will be a major (like we've never seen before) economic collapse within the next 5 years. I know your $10,000 will buy a fraction of what it can now. Conversely, Bitcoin value will skyrocket. When you realize that, you will also realize you don't have the opposite problem as the OP, but a completely different problem.

There are many reasons, but most right now likely are not obvious/applicable to you yet. For me, when I sub-contract data-entry work etc to other countries, paying that person can be very expensive, time consuming and slow. With Bitcoin, it is almost free, easy to do, and instant. That is a huge improvement over fiat currency.

I would argue the the implied Redditor IQ issue, but regardless, it is pretty easy to understand that if it worked, you wouldn't have time to be posting about it.

I was just thinking about teachers. How can it disrupt their career. Then I realized that with Bitcoin, I can easily pay a teacher in some far remote country very little, but they can teach via the Internet - and maybe 30-50 kids at a time. So yes - the OP may be right. Try to think of a job or business it won't impact and list it here. I bet others will point out ways it will be impacted.

If you walked into a dealership with $30k in fiat, I'm guessing that would trigger a call to the police. Expect the same if paying in Bitcoin. Stupid, but it would not surprise me.

@_date: 2015-03-15 14:58:45
They asked for easiest. Not easiest without a bank account. Since pretty much everyone in developed countries has a bank account, then that is not a barrier to 'easiest'.
Granted - not all countries are like that. So, I see your point about 'unbanked' people. But, Bitcoin needs to walk before it can run. It will happen.

Nothing wrong with SCAW using a ChangeTip account for instance, or setting up their own Bitcoin donation address. But I will reach out to BlackBaud too. Good catch.
Every instance where they move money, they pay fees. Once they see those fees disappear for receiving donations, then the natural next step is to use Bitcoin wherever possible.

Sure it can. This is standard practice. [See here.](
However, your scenario is correct too. So, put them both together and you have an insane system based completely on debt. In other words, for an economy to grow, debt must grow. Repeat over and over until a collapse. Or, we just move to Bitcoin.

You are implying that you believe going over a tax bracket is going to cost you to pay a higher tax rate on ALL your income. Not sure about Australia, but I bet it is the same as in Canada in this regard and people here make the same mistake.
For example, let's assume up to $40K is 30% tax, and over $40K is 50% tax. The mistake people make here is they think that if they hit $41K, they are going to have to pay 50% tax on ALL of the $41K. That is not true.
The math would be you pay 30% on $40K and 50% on $1K.
So, do the math and then ask your self if it is worth the effort and risk. If your answer is 'Yes', think again.
Don't get me wrong - I think we all pay far too much tax, and paying more than you legally should is also wrong. But, when you break the law, you are giving the government power to make an example of you. They won't care how little you actually 'saved' and decide based on that.
Far better to lower your taxes legally using methods not well understood by most people. PM me for a link to a site I think you should subscribe to.
When it comes to correcting the problem of all of us paying far too much in taxes ... the Blockchain will eventually add so much transparency to all things in politics and governments, that it will ultimately resolve that for us.

The article is about the 'broken system' in the USA, but is not about Capital Controls.
Having said that, there are indeed capital controls in place in the USA.
It is just done in a way that hides that fact. Due to FACTA, American citizens are having their bank accounts closed in other countries. Foreign Banks will refuse to open new accounts for Americans. Further, it is illegal to carry too much cash while traveling. So the net effect is you can't get your money out of the country, even though it is legal to do it assuming you could find a foreign bank willing to accept the wire transfer.

You are referring to using BIP38? Yes. Of course assuming a strong pass phrase, you can give a hard copy of the encrypted private key to your father.

You should also consider that in the event of your death, someone gets that pass phrase in a secure manner.

If I have $100 in fiat, and it becomes worth must more in another currency, I don't pay taxes on it. Same goes for a house. If it is worth $200K and then increase to $300K, I don't pay capital gains tax until it is sold. So, just leave your BTC in BTC. Then there is nothing they can do.

You don't know that.
Even if true, I still don't see how profit could be his motivation to leave an awesome life and future in Hawaii to be a life long target of the USA.
Also - you assume it is easy to sell information to governments. Think about how YOU would go through those steps. Probably just as dangerous as being an enemy of the USA government. So, he would have to hope he can navigate through that before the profit is there.
I don't buy the profit motive.
