The receipt I printed on 9/29 reads "Buy Completed, 0.41936381 BTC will arrive in your BTC Wallet account on Monday Oct 5, 2015."  I read "Buy Completed" as the plain English meaning of the words.  If they want to argue that a "buy" isn't actually "completed" until the bitcoin is delivered, then what they're explicitly displaying on the screen to customers like me is ambiguous at best...and the courts generally find in favor of the consumer in cases of ambiguity like that.

I understand what "costing" means.  My friend and I were going to split the $75 bonus, thus providing me with more income.  Make sense?
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:36:02
I understand that payouts are based on when a transaction completes.  I wasn't expecting for a payout to my account to occur before my funds were transferred into the account.  I also understand that Coinbase paid people more than thery were promised in a previous circumstance; good on Coinbase.  However, I fundamentally disagree with your position regarding the amount of referral bonus paid in my circumstance.

Fine, Coinbase can change their program any time.  But let's put it another way.  Say I initiated a transfer under a referral program with a $75 payout, then Coinbase changed the terms (before my transfer completed) to be a $75 **charge** to my account, leaving me with only $25.  They can do that, right?  They can change the terms to whatever they want, right?  Absolutely, they can...but the problem is that it's neither ethical nor lawful.  


I had an agreement in place with my friend, the referrer, where they would pay me a portion of the referral, and we would both end up better off than what we actually received after the program change.  So that statement doesn't actually apply to me.
You can scream from the mountaintops that you have every right to screw consumers, but I will refute it every time.  Keep doubling-down on policy-speak.

I'm glad you see that they've stolen from me.  My argument is that my example and reality are one in the same, just using different numbers...10 versus negative 75.  Regardless, you should see that changing an agreement after the fact does not pass the sniff test.  If you still disagree, what if they changed it to a $0.00001 bonus?  Would that still seem fair to you?
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:58:50
That's not correct.  The terms listed are fairly simple and easy to understand.  They changed the offer **after** I accepted it.  Contract law 101 says you can't do that.
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:43:51
Coinbase made a public offer: Deposit $100 with us and we'll give you $75.  I accepted the offer by initiating a funds transfer.  Their terms clearly state that it could take a week for funds to transfer, there's no misunderstanding there.   The word "offer" has a very specific meaning in terms of the law.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:36:52
You raise a good point regarding pricing. 
In the day-to-day of Coinbase usage, yes, transferring funds to your account is an independent and wholly separate action from purchasing bitcoin.  However, as I described above, the initial account setup incorporated a transfer and a buy as a single action on my part.  I just want to be crystal clear on that part.
I just took a look at the receipt I printed on 9/29 and I see now where the confusion is.  It literally says "Buy Completed, 0.41936381 BTC will arrive in your BTC Wallet account on Monday Oct 5, 2015".  Silly me, why did I think that I had actually bought anything on 9/29?!
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:54:52
I see, you clearly don't have any formal training with regard to contract law and you are misusing many words.  Your arguments are invalid.
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:36:44
Yeah, I need to do some research to figure out the best options.  This seemed like a good idea and the $75 is what convinced me to try it out.  It's a shame, but I'm sure we're not the only ones...
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:57:10
No doubt, they can and will change their referral program.  They have every legal right to do that in principle.  We just disagree on what're considered "fair" changes.
If you've been successful with getting all of the bonuses due to you, that's awesome.  Truly happy for you and for everyone else who's gotten in on it.
As you said, you win some and you lose some, and in my case I lost.  
Will I continue using Coinbase?  I don't know.  Will Coinbase shut down my account for what I've posted here?  I don't know.
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:37:56
Thanks for the detailed explanation and questions.  Here's what I did to my recollection:
1) Clicked a referral link, 2) Read through the terms and created an account, 3) Confirmed my bank account, and 4) Initiated a balance transfer to purchase bitcoin (on September 29).
There was nothing for me to do beyond that.  In my experience as a customer, initiating a quality transfer was one in the same action as purchasing bitcoin.  
To reiterate, there was no further action for me to take.  I had already fulfilled my end of the bargain.  In essence, I accepted the offer through my actions.
I won't try to define the words offer and acceptance here.  If you're truly interested look at the Wikipedia article for Offer and Acceptance, it's not a bad explanation of how things work in the US.  Beyond that, you can look many places to find the legal definition of a contract...which is based on an offer plus acceptance, plus other things.
To speak about contingencies, let's take a common example: a real estate sales contract contingent upon sale.  If I submit a contract to purchase your home, contingent upon the sale of my own house and we both sign it, then I don't have to actually purchase your house until I sell mine.  That doesn't mean I can drop the price arbitrarily on a whim...just because.  Now let's throw in the famous fine print where Coinbase can change the program on a whim.  I don't have any problem with the concept at all.  My problem is that they made a public offer, my actions constituted acceptance of that specific offer, and thus we had a contract.  They claim to have changed the offer, but that only happened **after** I had already accepted it.  They've broken the contract.  They are in the wrong.
If you still disagree with me on the premise of what constitutes an offer or an acceptance, I won't argue it any further.  I believe I am right.  My lawyer believes I'm right.  Any anyone else is free to make up their own mind.

I'm only repeating myself when anyone challenges my assumptions or the veracity of my statements.  My original post was a simple warning to others based on my personal experience.  When others want to argue my points, I'll stand toe to toe.  Like you said companies can and will do what they want.  Their actions can draw the ire of regulators, who are generally on the lookout for companies looking for unethical or unlawful behavior.  I'm not personally talking here about whether they deprived me of good and valuable consideration, but rather *how much*.
Look, I get it, some people don't care what happens to other people and everyone is on their own.  Some might even say "totes unfair" = illegal on reddit.  Some folks might want to brigade and shut down my thread.  That doesn't mean I have to just roll over and take whatever I feel is unfair coming from Coinbase, and I choose to post my experience here. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:45:42
Exactly, they can do that, just as someone can push someone else off of a cliff to their death, but that doesn't make it ethical or legal.  I simply want everyone to know that Coinbase has done wrong by me and might do the same to others.
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:39:37
Sure, let me do so by way of example.  Say that the situation was that I was referred based on a $75 bonus offer, started my funds transfer, then they changed the terms to a $75 fee on my account, leaving me with $25.  Same exact situation, just changing the numbers.  Does that feel more like scam to you?
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:43:10
Thanks for the extremely helpful advice.  I would suggest you do the same with my post.  
"Of course, no referral bonus was paid out until the funds cleared my account – not a problem."
I don't have a problem with the **timing** of the referral, I have a problem with them bait and switching me on the **amount**.

Hi John,
One last question regarding this issue.  The confirmation page I printed on September 29th says "Buy Completed, 0.41936381 BTC will arrive in your BTC Wallet account on Monday Oct 5, 2015".   I would think that this pretty clearly indicates to me as a customer that the "buy" has been "completed" and that after the BTC arrives in my wallet, the referral fee would be paid based on the terms offered by Coinbase and accepted by me.  Do you still disagree?  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:51:06
It's funny to me how every commenter here has repeated the basic message: *caveat emptor*, let the buyer beware.  I think that's roughly what I'm trying to inform about here, and everyone is bashing me and downvoting.  Flame on, I've got thick skin!
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:33:47
That hurts my feewings.  All these years I've been thinking I wasn't an idiot, and you here, with 3 simple words, well, you've just settled it.
Really, you had me going there, I thought we were having an actual discussion and then you throw out the ad hominem.  Troll level 10 effort.  Great job!
I'll give it another shot since you seem to have thick skin.  Your other posts elsewhere have many mentions about how people are stupid and whiny (I paraphrase), and that no one should bother to try to convince anyone to not use a particular company's services (again, I paraphrase).  Perhaps you feel the same way about me, amongst other issues you might take with what I've said here.  Honestly, I don't care what you think.  Downvote me, attack me, whatever.  Unless this thread gets disappeared, I've done my job.  Anyone searching for information on Coinbase referrals, wanting to know if they're legitimate, may end up finding this page and do some reading.  They may disagree with me, which is fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion.   I'm not asking anyone for anything, I'm just sharing information.  Or being an idiot.  One of those two.

Why was the subreddit closed off?
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:56:33
So by that logic, they can change the terms to steal all of my money out of my wallet, because they can change the terms whenever they want to whatever they want, right?
