Thank you for the response. +100 bits I figured you guys were working on something on your end. It'd be nice to have an affiliate wallet or something of the like that could still access funds should you guys go down. Its not fun not being able to access funds :(

Also, I do agree that some users here are close-minded when it comes to altcoins/other projects. I am invested mostly in Bitcoin but def. see promise in projects like Ethereum and especially Counterparty. It will be interesting to see what happens now that sidechains have been thrown into the mix. We are still very early in development/innovation but the point is that all of that hard work and capital that has been poured in this year alone is being dumped into *Bitcoin* and its (waaay) bigger and therefore stronger network, and none of the other coins.

I downloaded the airbitz iOS wallet about a week ago. I do agree that it has a familiar and easy to use interface but I ran into a couple issues that I would suggest be worked out on the next update. First and most important, the security questions need to be re-written and more added. This is the ONLY way to recover your wallet (no email/phone verification or HD seed) Second, it is annoying to login to the wallet with my password everytime I open the app. The password is 12 char minimum with special char and numbers (i think) and it is annoying to type in everytime you open the wallet portion of the app. Fingerprint and/or passcode unlock should be implemented. Third is the ability to import private keys and have watch only addresses. Overall it is a decent wallet (allows export private keys and also has a neat feature ,something i wish more wallets implemented, and that is the ability to scan a qr code from a picture). The best feature is the merchant directory, and it is nice to see my business on the first page :)
Edit: i know that you can change the auto log off to up to 60 days and you're still protected with your withdrawal pin but i think the pin to unlock the wallet is a better/less confusing implementation. The average user usually doesn't bother to even mess with the settings in apps, mostly just the tech-savvy's like us

Because when I spend my btc the seller likely converts most of it to usd, which means there is more bitcoin supply. So I buy more instantly. I'm sorry you don't understand these things, I hope you do now. Hodl away now boy

As an alternative to sending the coins to another wallet and re-paying fees, you could copy your public address from Coinbase and set up a "watch only" wallet (through blockchain.info or some others). This would allow you to watch an address, but the wallet does not contain the private keys to spend the funds.

They could try this: sellers with low reputation start with pages that look very basic. As an incentive, as proof of burn reputation gets higher openbazaar can give sellers more options to customize the look of their store. Better reputation = better store

There's this thing called the rest of the world and the unbanked. (Assuming you're American). Also if bitcoin can do things the current fiat and bank system can't, then it is already more sufficient. These apps and services to make bitcoin easier to use and more versatile are in development, just needs more time and manpower.

Although I haven't made any sales in BTC yet, BitPay has the easiest to use and cleanest looking payment gateway. Plus they make it very easy to decide what percentage of BTC you want to convert to USD. Best of all, its free forever. Coinbase merchant works good but not as easy to use imo

The simple fact is most merchants have no idea what bitcoin is even though they have heard it can save them money. BitPay and Coinbase are doing an awesome job at introducing merchants to bitcoin, and eventually when they start charging 1% merchants will have more of an understanding of bitcoin and will take bitcoin payments directly to avoid the fee.

What does purchasing the documentary have to do with the paid advertisement of bitcoin? The more the doc is watched, the more people will know about bitcoin. Torrent downloads will only help spread knowledge about Bitcoin.
In regards to advertisement for Bitcoin, it will be up to the companies who are profiting from the use of bitcoin to pay for them. I'm sure they are planning for this, and are waiting for the right time. Anyone else who paid for an advertising campaign would be losing money, though it would be really cool of them.

@_date: 2014-11-02 00:18:54
Thanks for the love guys, first time I received a tip :) However I kindly ask to not send me any more tips (on this thread). Let's literally "spread the love" as put it. I hope that more people see this and decide to make a pledge! Whether you tip daily, weekly, or just once this month you are proving your devotion to the community and helping spread the word about our "smart money"
edit: made note of something important earlier today. **Positive feedback is directly related to the size of the tip.** The way I thought about it was min. $1/day = about 30 bucks at the end of the month. For me this is doable and I hope to tip more. If you are not comfortable doing that, just tip sparingly. I doubt most users would be hurting if they gave away $10-15 worth of btc, especially if it helps the community grow.
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:32:42

Remember, 1 btc = 100 million satoshis. If there is exponential growth, there will still be enough to go around. And if/when the "late" adopters are ready to trade their shitty USD (or if super inflation occurs, whatever else they have for trade)  for btc they will be free to through exchanges, or locally. The government/banks do not want bitcoin to succeed, so why would take the initiative to go through with what you are proposing? These "rich" people will probably have a plan B

Thanks for your input. You are right, it is hard to spend your bitcoin at many retailers right now; gyft and brawker have decent solutions for this at the moment. I hope it becomes easier as more big names start to accept the currency (At this point last year ZERO billion dollar retailers accepted Bitcoin, now there is 10). The point of tipping every day this month is to hope that whatever subreddit you choose to tip in and the users reading gain an appreciation and understanding of digital currencies, or simply just find it really cool that you can tip anyone, anywhere, at any time.

How would it be stealing money from people who hold ETH and didn't invest in the DAO? Current proposals assure the thief would be unable to retrieve all or a majority of stolen DAO funds. It's either "fork" and make sure the ether in the DAO stays safe or don't and thief runs with loot. Ether-only holders unaffected, actually would more than likely benefit the project by avoiding MtGox 2.0

Paul, love your app but have come across one minor nuisance. It is a little confusing to bring up a qr code since you must select a payment amount first (and then it doesn't show the original address). I found that leaving the inputs at 0 brings up the original address and qr code but it is a bit tricky to figure out. Anyways thanks for helping make the app, it's great and love the Bluetooth feature...wish more wallets used it
