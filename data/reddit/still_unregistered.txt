I already expressed my opinion on this project some time ago.
As someone who work full-time on an open source project/company, this **is great** but ... you could tip a project that **does not signed up** for it (for example ours is already there), tip4commit will receive the money without the project developers approval (i think they sent an email with the first donation received, but couldn't confirm it). I think it's a great project, but in my opinion you should not be able to tip a project that doesn't signed up.

It's easy, but it's a "lengthy" process.
* Go to website
* Get challenge (message to sign)
* Open your wallet
* Input your password
* Sign message
* Copy sign
* Go to website again and input it
* Finally logged
versus (traditional login)
* Go to website
* Input your user &amp; password
* You're logged!
I did not see any advantage over remembering my user&amp; password, since my wallet password is longer than my "normal" passwords. Where I see an improvement on this process is using a device (smartphone, trezor,...), My trezor is only pin-protected, which is easier to remember than a alphanumeric password (also less secure).
Do not take me wrong, I DID implement/port BitId to PHP and added sign/verify messages to trezor wallet (they didn't accept my pull-request yet), I think it's a great idea, but we need to make some "standard" protocol for authorization and then have wallet implement it, so you could login with a few click.

I still think that the future of mining resides in BitPay, Circle, CoinBase,... and even Paypal, Amazon, (if they jump in)... 
It wouldn't be difficult for them to have a big mining farm and a big chunk of the hashrate. Then, it would be stupid to destroy their own business model for a short term profit
@_date: 2014-09-15 06:14:45
Asking for the private key is a big no-no for me. If you need that step, then do something similar to trezor, send me a template transaction, I will privately signed it with my key and then send it to you so you could check/broadcast it.
Also, it would be much better, faster and cheaper to handle all internal coins movements with an internal non-bitcoin ledger (just database movements). So user A could send money to user B or buy product X without a (bitcoin) transaction fee. Only if user A wants to withdraw his coins, then use bitcoin

If I'm not wrong, Trezor browser plugin only works on selected domains (localhost.mytrezor.com &amp; mytrezor.com), at least is what I got when trying to run the webwallet on my server, as plugins fails to connect to the trezor on any other domain. In order to use bitid/bitauth, the plugin should work on any domain. Not sure if that has changed.
Also, as a web-dev, I would like to contribute somehow, but not really sure where to start (Did [this PR]( -hope it wasn't to wrong ). I suggest you label some issues/ideas as "EASY" or "newbie ready" so  people like me could collaborate.

As an active web/php developer that make my living with an open source / free project (also hosted in github) I never heard of tip4commit before (I heard and signed up on gittip, which is similar).
Anyway someone is accepting donations IN YOUR NAME, before you ever signed up and taking a 5% cut from it. Website looks pretty standard (bootstrap?) and it's not clear how to claim you're the owner of a project (I tried to, but it wasn't clear why it needs access to my full profile of github, I stopped there).
Some things need to be sorted out, first, don't allow donations to a project that hasn't signed up yet. If that's the case, to send them a request (email/tweet/whatever and let them know someone is interested in donating some BTC to them - only once!!). Also, provide some widgets (there's one, but it looks quite bad on my monitor =/ ), so people could place the widget in their websites and spread the word, also, that will allow users to discover new projects to donate.
This is my humble opinion, I see a lot of potential. A little FAQ with some examples would be helpful. Also it's not clear, but I think that the NEXT commit (no matter if it's a simple comma out of place or several files change) get the whole pending tip. Because as a maintainer then it's very easy to screw commiters just making a change yourself (like a white space) before you accept the commiter's commit.

Yes, but what I mean is that people is stupid and careless, people were still making deposits on Gox after all, 6 months back they started to have withdrawals problems and limits, and people were still using it as an exchange!

This is the same as having several copies of your wallet, which could led to errors, what will happen if you replace one of the files with a backup? they will not be in sync. How do you know a priv. key is missing? from which file do you replace it from?

Isn't it simple for miners to block transactions containing addresses (from/to bitnet) to be included in the block?
I mean, it's destroys the concept of decentralized, but miners could rely on some third party / security companies blacklist to stop the menace.

My point is, I could tip X project, but it could be unclaimed (maybe the devs/commiters don't know how bitcoin works, or didn't realize they're being tipped,...). Then, my tip will be sitting in tip4commits forever...

 Any plans to implement [bitID]( on the trezor? (not really sure how, but it would be cool).

Not sure what is the difference, I found it quite similar to BitID  but I'm not a crypto-genius. Being BitID or BitAuth or any other name, I like the idea, I think there should be a proposal/standard and let everyone work together on it so it could be integrated in the wallets.

Are you actively trading? If yes keep it at the exchange, if not, there's no reason to keep them there.
I keep most of my coins in a wallet on my PC, some on my phone ready to use them (some are shared with the PC), little-to-none on exchange. Why I would let others to take care of my money if I could handle it myself?

IIRC , Sybil attack depends on controlling a huge number of nodes. So there's a big probability that your client connect to one of the attacker's node. The attacker could then, decided not to relay your transactions and isolate you from the network. It could also try to make some double spend attacks.
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:37:39
yes, we're saying same thing. But a wallet is a bit more than just the priv/pub keys (  ), for example the transactions of each address, so it don't have to re-scan the blockchain each time you want to know the balance of an address.
So if in fact Gox was vulnerable to TM (or any other "error"), it would process a withdrawal twice, but only register one in their wallet and in their private ledger
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:13:07
But what if the corruption/error is copied to the second/third/n-th wallets too? I mean, that the disk is ok, but it was the writing/generation key process that failed, so the file is not corrupted, simply, at some point the program emptied/blank the private key before writing it to the wallet file
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:40:29
Share the address, so we could check if the letter is opened before time!

I read somewhere that they were using their own implementation of a wallet/bitcoin software. At some point, their wallet stops being in sync with the blockchain, they didn't care at all or their implementation was bugged and weren't able to detect the problem.
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:20:56
Wallet software is no different from any other software or file. So if you could distribute a program through bittorrent, you could distribute any bitcoin wallet software as well. 
Problem with bittorrent or any P2P file distribution is that you can not trust the downloaded file, you'll never know if the file is the original or not. (You could get a checksum to check the validity of the file, but where do you get the checksum?)
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:34:05
If they had their own implementation AND said implementation was reporting the same amount that their private account ledger, the problem could have been undetected for quite a long time.
Once they realized they had a sync problem, they'd had to check what accounts had real money and what not, this could be complicated if they had several wallets, with thousands of addresses on several servers/places,...  check a few accounts against the blockchain, realize there's no money and assume everything is gone, then start checking every fucking address against the blockchain (which takes time).
Also, at some point they could have lost some private keys, a client of mine lost 25minutes of money transactions (not BTC related, real money) because their server's disk had a hardware failure and their last backup was from 25min before (hourly backups). Let's say they had some failure, or simply overwrite their wallet with and older backup...
This doesn't explain how they "lost" their cold-storage money (if they did or at least argued that, which I'm not sure)

thanks, that was what I was looking for

Does anyone know where to get more technical information about the trezor? (in particular trezor.js, their browser plugin and trezord). I'm playing with their code to extend its functionality and I'm having some unexpected results, not sure if I'm doing it wrong or something is not yet implemented (sign &amp; verify messages, it's only half working =/ )
I do not want to bother them as their email support is managed by a non-programmer person and probably my questions/doubts are too stupid.
@_date: 2014-09-13 21:23:17
Problem is that you need a wallet with BitID / BitAuth / whatever support, until then, it would be a pain in the ass (signing a message manually) to log in with bitcoin in any site

Their fees are not regulated, only credit/debit cards' fees. So a bank could increase their fees, like "yearly fee to maintain costs" or put a fee to access your online account , as LaCaixa does, some banks are already asking for fees to make a direct deposit if you're not a customer and it's not the right day of the week...

Probably to be downvoted but anyway, there's no need to "real test" every unit, the same reason each of your smartphone is not tested, that will be stupid and a time wasting activity (unless of course, they produce money).
Usually you test that all the connections are ok (basically, that the device power up) and then select a few of them to throw them other tests (depends on what tests and depends on a few more things, but it's a very small % of actual production). The thing is that your product (the miner) should be ok, but sometimes shit happens (bad quality materials, machine misaligned, environmental changes as temperature or humidity,...) and that's the reason why we test a few (NOT ALL) units of each batch.
It's more cost effective to ship units without testing everyone of them, and later replace (for free) the bad ones, of course, unless said units are ASIC miners that could print money, in that case, yes, "testing" is more cost-effective. Tested units should be in customers hands, they could keep them and make their small farm to still earn some more money.
My background: a master in mathematics, I develop several QA tests, both practical and theoretical. 
TLRD; There's no real reason to test out every unit

incautar = seize
Other thing is that they actually seize the bitcoins and the information of the newspaper is right. My guess is that they use bitcoin to do some laundry and that's all, but maybe they confiscated their computers and took the bitcoins to another address.

Depends on how fast the ASICs spread... If they spread slowly, nothing will happen since they couldn't make an impact. If 9999 miners are using GPU and only one is using ASIC, the amount of coins will be similar. On the other hand, if they spread quickly, the market will be flood with new bitcoins and the prices will drop.
Determining how much is slow or how much is fast depends on the adoption of the bitcoin as a currency. For example, if FEW stores accept BTC as a valid payment method, then once the market is flooded with new ASIC coins, the prices will drop since there will be a lot of coins but no use for them, so people will not buy them to use them. On the other hand, if stores accept BTC as a payment method, people (non-miners, gpu-miners) will buy them to spend, keeping the price "stable".
At the end is the old law offer/demand, offer being the ASIC mining and demand being the stores/customers using them.
In my humble opinion, there aren't enough stores yet and BTC is not widespread enough to handle the ASIC mining yet (there will be more offer than demand). But the recent media about BTC has attracted some VC, funds,... so maybe they will absorb the new coins in hopes of a rising price

A few months ago there were a big security issue with one version of java but it could be anything (pirated content, outdated browsers,...), 
Once the malware is installed, it's quite easy to set up an alarm for a few actions/websites, so everytime you enter a website, the address is checked against a list (banks? email? bitcoin exchanges? ...) If that's the case, start recording keyboard input and set it to an external server once it finished. Antivirus/Security companies already stated a few times that they are a few steps behind the hackers/bad people.
2FA is a MUST if you're going to play with money on the computer, banks usually give you a 2FA digital device (as the yubikey, or digipass) or a more primitive card with numbers. So even in case they accessed your account they will not be able to do anything without them.
For Mt.Gox, Bitstamp,... and company it's quite simple to require 2FA, they will loss a few customers that will not understand it or get bored before they even set it up, but in the long run, people will get less robbed/hacked.
I would be interesting if OP tell us about his setup (OS version, browser,...)

In that case (a few ASIC miners will have all the btc instead of gpu users), so they could : spend them (prices will remaing the same) or sell them (prices will drop a little, since an ASIC miner will have more coins than he will use...) or keep them (in that case, there will be a shortage of coins and the prices will rise).

Your wallet could (or must) have a "password" (walletpassphrase)
Each bitcoin address has a public key (the address itself) and a private key (used to do all the transactions and stuff).
In order to control/have a bitcoin address, you need both, public and private keys, since you should not use directly the private key (unless import/export keys) it's not told to you, but stored in the wallet.dat file.
If you encrypted your wallet (with a walletpassphrase / password) to export (show) the private key  you need to input it, to unlock your wallet (the same if you want to make a transaction, you will need to unlock it with the password).
I hope this is a bit more clear (and I didn't make any big mistake).
I would wait until the wallet is synced to check is it's your wallet or not. In case you don't want to/could not wait to. I think you can 1.- export your keys 2.- import them in blockchain (web wallet, never used), blockchain should be synced. 3.- Inmediately transfer all the bitcoins to a newly created address (I do not trust web wallets).

Nowadays most banks have online management tools, pretty good. I spent also a few years abroad (studying in several countries). I ALWAYS carry a credit card, no matter how much cash I'm carrying, because you never know what could happen.
I currently have accounts in Czech Rep., Luxembourg and Spain, all of them managed via Internet

you're right, not sure how I did that math mistake, anyway , my answer is still valid, fees are flexible, you could send a transaction without any fee at all, but it will have the lowest priority and wait a lot to be processed. In the future miners will be starting to accept lower fees since people will lower the fees they wanted to pay too.

Whick UK in included. A SEPA transfer is usually "cheaper" (or free) than an international one (to a non-SEPA country). ING (not sure if available in UK , but it's in Belgium, Luxemburg, Spain, Netherlands,..) has both SEPA and non-SEPA transfers free of fees.
Since you live in UK, and using pounds, you will have to convert them to EUR or USD (I don't know any BTC exchange in pounds). Changing from pounds to usd/eur at a bank could be expensive

Here: 
Money and any kind of goods are considered donations:


ANyway, even if BTC are not considered donations directly (which by law they are) if they want to spend their BTC the could : 1. do it in BTC form (few services/stores in Spain yet) or convert them to EUROs, in that case they will have to explain how it's possible to convert "bits of data" to EUROs and not consider them a donation.
Good thing, they're a political party. Their accounting is not public, and the courts of auditors is 5 years late on its works. If nothing happens with recent scandal of "Partido Popular" and their accountant "Bárcenas", nothing serious will happen to them either

Main problem is that the European Union is not a "democracy", some countries (Germany, France,...) have more power just because they put more money in the common basket. To put out an example, while all other 26 countries could agree on approving a law, Germany could say no and ban it. It also happens that we included some countries (east europe) that were not yet ready to be in the EU, so the economic and social gap was increased. In addition, what happened is that Germany invest a lot of money in southern countries (PIGS) before the crisis and is now trying to recover it.
One strong opinion is that instead of breaking the euro or southern countries left it, it should be Germany who leaves the euro. If we take Germany out of the equation economic/social gap is not so big,  but if we take out the PIGS, there's still a big gap among germany/france and east europe.
In my personal opinion, BTC is not as spread here as in the US. From all of my friends (most of them tech-savvy) I'm the only one who has a few coins, a few of them had already heard about it, but most of them no, and aren't interested.

C. Yes and no, they could already improve their API and they choose not to. Really, I'm a web developer, and even I made a few payment modules, each time is a pain in the ass. Their API and documentation just sucks and I don't know why. They have like 4 different documentations and each one tells you a different thing.
Could they update their APIs? Yes, but they are so spread and there're so many sites using paypal that it will take long time before they do.
Should Paypal move to bitcoin? Yes
Will that wipe out coinbase, bitinstant,...? No, Amazon payments if growing, Google checkout is growing, Braintree is new, but it looks amazing as an alternative to Paypal,... and those services are currently in competition with Paypal. All bitcoin-related services have an already advantage to them.
In my opinion we'll see how in the next few years a lot of services are created to handle BTC payments, eventually some (if not most, but never all) of them will fall

Steambits does NOT state in any place that the games are for the US region, which is also a problem, you can not buy a game in a different region... or your account will be suspended or the game deleted from your account.
Main problem with accepting BTC as a method of payment is its volatility, until that is a bit more stable, we can not expect Steam to accept BTC

Yeah, I know the theory, but it didn't work for me. I even flashed the same ROM without luck (I read somewhere that upgrading the version of Android could cause titanium backup to not work correctly, but that wasn't my case).
I'm not sure what I did wrong, other apps were backed up correctly, but not Google Authenticator. Luckily for me, I always do a backup before the new flash, so, restore said backup, take the database and restore the backup with the new flashed rom.
I tried more than once with titanium backup different combinations of flash/wipe/... none worked, not sure why. I have nothing against it, I think it's a great program, but it didn't worked for me this time (I'm using JellyBeer for SGS2)

this was 4 years ago, not sure if they changed anything, but i have to say the postal address were different, if you put the same address and information you will probably got caught sooner or later.

The bank want a fee? Not mine! I don't want to make spam of it, but my bank doesn't take any fee, not for a normal transfer, not for a SEPA (yes, i'm european), not for an international (to america or japan for example).
Bitstamp didn't take a fee either, Mtgox did (for the transfer, both of them will take a fee 0.5% and 0.6% when buying/selling bitcoins) . The only problem I see is that it could a few days (2 or 3) to complete the process... which is usually the time for any international transfer. Bitinstant seems to fix this wait time, but it didn't work on my country.
Did you ever tried to buy ANY other currency? The bank will take a fee for the process (usually, much much higher than 0.5-0.6%), of course, you could buy other currencies at those shops at the airport, some of them took a fee, some don't, but usually the price is higher so the fee is included.
I really don't see the problem, if you never had exchange your money into another currency, yes, you will face a few fees no-one told you they exists.

* As a kid I will be disappointed if someone gift me a "paper wit magic internet money" and not something i could play with/wear/touch it/...
* In my opinion, 12yo is still too young to have a real concept of money and spend it carefully
* If he like it, he probably want to show it to everyone, there's a risk he gets it stolen/lose it/... Same if he has it on his computer, risk of him getting viruses and having to format the drive without backup?
* I personally think the current price is too high, so if the price go back a little he could be disappointed. (anyway, $100 for a 12yo seems too much for me)
Don't take me wrong, I would have loved to have bitcoins so young, but I was a kid, I was not responsible and there're a lot of things that could go wrong and permanent lost the bitcoins.
I think it would be a great "complimentary gift", like you gift him something else AND bitcoins (less amount, for example $20). $20 would be as could as $100, plus he got another gift, and if he loses the bitcoins is not that much.

Biggest problem I see here is that as soon as you "contribute" with the project, you sent your bitcoins to another address. While this is not bad, it's also not good. Kickstarter only takes the money if the fund limit is reached, at the end of the process.
With bitcoins, that's not possible. So in case I contribute to an idea/project/whatever you call it, in the first day, and the project has a 30days limit. My money will be sitting on your account (the escrow account) for 30days. You could do nothing with said money, or you could put it on a deposit and earn a % back. Which in my opinion is not fair, or it's fair if you did not take a fee per project and do it (as kickstarter does)
@_date: 2013-08-27 11:30:50
Thanks for my first tip ever!
* For small amounts, the gov. doesn't care (at least, in Spain, in the U.S. or other places it could be different, but I think it would be similar). IIRC in Spain you have to declare all transfers or money transactions over 2500€. In fact, a recent law was made that you can not made payments bigger than 2500€ in cash (it has to be a bank transfer, so the gov. will know about it).
* I don't know which amount is the limit to start paying taxes or not. It also depends how do you declare that money (donation, heritage, personal loan, casino, lottery,...) Each reason has its different tax, and different limit to start or not paying taxes.
* Usually "all money" have to be declared, (for example, a U.S. person working in another country would have to pay taxes in said country AND to the U.S., most people don't do it). In Spain, if you have more than 50.000€ in assets (money or real estate) outside the country you "have to" declare it and pay taxes for it. Any amount less than that is tax-free.
* IRS, Government,... could only know about the money you declare to have or the money the banks declare you have. They can not know how much money do you have in cash for example... 
* I think some banks share their information cross-country (to avoid fraud, money laundering,...)
* If the bank see something strange, they will tell the gov. about it. For example, if instead of a 25.000€ transfer, you made 11 payments of 2499€ (to not raise the over 2500€ flag).
* Small amounts are usually, tax-free, but again, don't make a hundred small transfer because you will raise some flags
* Bitcoins are yet to be regularized, but for me they are like another currency, in that case, you have to declare about the winning/loses each year (in case they went over a limit), just the same as I play with the euro-dolar price
* Transactions over the limit would have to be declared, but as far as you don't tell anyone it's the same as having them in cash. For example, I received 30BTC, which is more or less 3000€. If I had those 3000€ in cash (without putting them in the bank), it would be illegal, but as long as they don't caught you, it's fine.
* NOT spending your bank money will raise flags, let's say you get paid a certain amount on the bank, and another (not declared) in cash/bitcoins. If you only spend the cash/bitcoins, someone could question you about how do you make a living without spending your money at all (remember, the gov. only knows about what you declare or your bank do).
* In short, bitcoin or any currency private (I don't think there's something like public) transaction are legal if : the amount is small for the limit (depends on your country/State) or if it's over the limit and you declare/pay taxes for it.
* In my opinion, "illegal" transactions does not exists, there exists only transactions which didn't pay the required taxes.
* With bitcoins, it's difficult to associate an individual with an address, so pretty much they are off the record.

People should not be speculating with bitcoins, they should using it. but beside that ... People "invest" more money than they should/have because they think daytrading is easy and they could get "rich" fast...when they lose a big chunk, they freak out and start selling to cut the losing.
I put 200$ in bitcoins, first because I want this to be successful and want to use it (living in Europe make it a bit harder to spend them than I thought since most websites don't ship here or the shipping cost is too damn high). I don't care if I lose those 200$ (I prefer not to!). Right now I'm lose around 20-25$ (price drop). I will just wait until it gets again the price I bought them to spend them, or just assume the loses (if they never get that high again). Again, I don't need those 200$, I feel no pressure losing them.

We should remember here that users at SR where selling/buying drugs and other "not-so-legal" things. (legal depends on the geographical location / country / region/ ... but assume they were all ilegal). So in my opinion, it's ok to have that money seized.
Besides that, let's supposse that a majority is a 51% of the bitcoin network/nodes. A LOT of nodes/miners should agree on doing something, at a global/worldwide scale. Bitcoin community is quite small right now and SR was a very well known website.How is possible to be a judge when there're millions of address out-there?
I mean, is like asking right now to decide if we should seized the banks accounts of an individual you know nothing about. How many petitions of blacklisting address will be have per day?
Also, undoing the blockchain will make miners lose money (fees) and all transaction AFTER a specific point. I'm not sure why a miner who has nothing to do with X address will decide to : 1) lose money, 2) undo a lot of transactions making people angry and losing faith in bitcoin

I really don't know how credit cards work, but as far as I know, went you fund some kickstarter, they make a "hold" on your money or just check you have enough funds. Again, I could be very wrong. Anyway, from that date to the end of the project, could happens a lot of things, and the money could not be there, or just charged back.
The "problem" with bitcoins, is that you are a "escrow" service, you hold money and then transfer it, I'm not sure if you will need to fill up more paper work. Kickstarter does not hold any money, it's the project account which receives the money directly from the backers, and kickstarter ask the founder a fee for the service. While KS just charge the project for its services, with your idea "maybe" you have to register as a "money trasmitter". This should not be a problem, just a bit more of work.
If I were to do this, I would just put all the money in a deposit somehow, so for every second I "escrow" the money, I got a % back, and the projects will not have to pay any fee, or at least, a smaller one.
Don't take me wrong, I think the idea is great
@_date: 2013-09-10 06:54:47
Yes, but then, they will not be able to spent it.. At the moment the company/individual decide to spent said money, the government will ask from where or when it came from.
For example, I gave you 1 million dollar in cash, you decided to put it in a safe box and not tell the gov. about it. You could spent it a few $$ each time, but if you decided to buy something "big" (house? car?,...) then you will raise some flags and the IRS will investigate  you, and how it's possible you could afford a house with your regular income. At least this is what it would happen in my country, not sure about the U.S., but probably the same

0.0005*200 = $0.01 or 1cent. 
If bitcoin reach the value of tens of thousand of dollars, then the transaction fee will be 0.000005 or smaller, or bigger,... fees are flexible, they're not fixed by the system, and are an incentive to miner to keep mining, bigger fee =&gt; faster your transaction gets processed

I'm a bit worried about "death" in the sense of :
* What will happen if my computer died and I lost my backup wallet? How many people will lost their money/wallet because of "format drive because of viruses" ?
* What will happen if I die? (for real), right now, one of my relatives could go to the bank with my death certificate and they will give him/her my money. With BTC ... unless you gave them your password is not possible to recover your coins... So you have to trust your relatives and give them your wallet password BEFORE you die (with the risk they run with your money).
* What will happen is I forgot the password/address of my own? Those coins will be lost forever.
Maybe this has been already discussed or explained somewhere, if done, I apologize for not seen it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 12:11:25
AFAIK it should have to be the other way around, that the thieves pay you.
If you connect to "StoleBTC-Wifi" and make a transaction, the transaction will never hit the real/official blockchain, you at the end you did not spent the money.
On the other hand, if you get paid by the thieves and connect to "StoleBTC-Wifi" network to check that the transaction is done, your client will be told that the transaction is done, but once you connect to another network and check with the real blockchain you will discover that you do not have the money.
So if you do in-person transaction always connect to 3G/HSPA/... and not to wifi networks, also, I think you can tell your client to connect to trusted nodes, but never done that.
Also, they have to fake a lot more than just the internet access, since the transaction has to be processed into a block and be confirmed by several miners.
**I'm not expert, so you shouldn't trust me**
About your first question... no, it's not possible to create a program that assign you a address/privatekey from a list. Well, it's possible but then bitcoin will be centralized, since any new address has to go to "the list" and ask for a non-used address/priv key.
The math in bitcoin privkey/address generation makes it *mathematically impossible* to generate two same keys. If you have been generating address since the beginning of the universe until now, you didn't make two address the same yet.

Depends on your country, and depends on the amount of money you're sending/receiving. As far as I know (at least where I live, Spain) law doesn't care if you know or don't the receiver of the money, he/she will have to pay taxes on said money (IIRC around 20%). Of course, only if you want to make it legal and declare it, if you handed me a bunch of bills and I keep them in my safe, the gov will never know. But if I put it on the bank and didn't say a word, well, that will raise a few questions. Again, depends on the amount, and your location's laws.

Sending a link to their email account is a bad idea, people use a more vulnerable passwords on their emails than to mtgox/bitstamp/whatever, so the target would be their emails and then in the exchange website just click on "I forgot my password send me to my recently hacked email".
2FA **does NOT** require a smartphone at all. Most spanish banks just send you a card with 50-60 numbered codes, on any action you want to make they ask you for a code of that card. What could be the cost of printing/sending said card worldwide? 2$? It could paid as an opening fee. You could even make it 10$ and send back a yubikey/digikey/whatever.

Problem is that payments to publishers/developers are not in real-time, are bached, probably once a month or something like that (like apple or google does, I really don't know how Steam manage this).
Let's say Steam sells 100.000 games at a 1BTC price (at 105USD,  10.500.000 USD), and it's one of those days that the price drops from 105USD to 100USD (happened this week), Steam just lost 500.000USD, in a mere few hours.
This doesn't matter if Steam is the owner of those bitcoins, but it's the money Steam has to pay the publishers/developers. If all of them accept to be paid in BTC, everything is fine, but if the publishers/devs want USD, Steam is half million USD short (devs expected to be paid 105$ per game, but Steam only have 100$ per game).
Of course, they could change in real time BTC -&gt; USD, but then there're fees everywhere (and no point in paying with BTC if you're going to sell them as soon as possible). 
All that said, I think that digital goods (in this case games), are perfect for BTC payments, the infraestructure to distribute them is almost the same for 100 copies than for 1 million copies, so profit grows very quickly and you could take some loses (due to volatility of BTC), but I think that it's not stable enough for Steam yet (I wish I could use my BTC more)

At this point, I'm not sure you understand how bitcoins works (or maybe I got it wrong). Once the transaction is on the blockchain you will have to undo the blockchain to remove it. Other thing is that ALL miners have a "blacklist" of addresses, which can not send/receive money, but if just ONE miner confirm a transaction from one of those address,... then again you will have to undo the blockchain

As I already said, electrical components/circuits are tested, and depends on a huge amount of factors what else is also tested. If you want to test the connectivity and that a miner will work, no more than a few minutes (being generous) is enough (connect to the pool, do 100 hashes,...).

Wow, this is actually cool for me. I'm one of the developers of Osclass (software behind this website) and recently get into BTC. I tried to get a Bitpay account to accept BTC as a method of payment (for feature ads or to pay for goods) but they didn't approve my account yet, do you know any other service?
As a note... did you tried our new theme "bender" (it's responsive), also, this week (or next, not sure yet), we'll be releasing a new version/small patch (3.1.2) an auto-update message should appear on your admin. If you have any idea on how to improve Osclass I will be here to listen.

IMHO, he looks like an asshole, and people usually don't side with assholes...
As I see this, it's the similar to go to an U.S. based shop and try to pay them in euros or pounds, and then rant over internet why they're stupid since they don't accept your euros/pounds. No one is going to side with him, even if he's right.
A better way to approach this was to tell that paying with bitcoins has some advantages for everyone, like lower fees per transaction, no charge-backs or that it's international, no need for a credit card,...
Anyway, people should understand that some other people don't want to risk with bitcoin volatility, or that bitcoins are not fully regulated in most countries (if any), and with all the stories of bank accounts getting closed because of bitcoins... it would be risky for a company to start accepting bitcoins if they're not sure what they're doing.
