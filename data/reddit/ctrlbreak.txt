Hey homie! Having a blast.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:00:39
Also, the reason I dropped that screenshot of my own at the time was because I was literally, just then, putting in place limiters myself on my own firewall to try and deal with the same mass of traffic (which I hadn't been keeping an eye on and was surprised it was so high)... so I feel your pain.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:03:34
Would have, but your not listening.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:27:27
It's posts like these that make me appreciate having a solid ISP where I live.
Regularly peered to ~120 nodes.  Bitcoind pushes some serious traffic.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:53:55
Appologies.  Was more of a comment on the same topic as others had already offered up a solution regarding configuration flags for bitcoind.
You could try tweaking -maxuploadtarget and/or -maxconnections to see if you can wrangle it to something manageable.
Another option would be if your modem/router/fw or whatever had any shaping or limiting capability, in which case you could arbitrarily restrict it that way.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:32:55
Could also append your username or other such tag to your User Agent string.  Then have them check your node via  if they lack their own method to do so.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:13:23
As soon as BTCD is sync'd up here... there'll be one more ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:43:57
Not quite.  This would be in the conf file for the wallet.

No intention of it ever going down from here on out ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:31:23
I feel the same way and may be in the same boat.  I've literally debated either 'retiring' or taking an extended sabbatical to do something similar.

You *can* run some integrated 2.5in USB-HDDs directly from the RPI.  I have one running both a full Bitcoin and Litecoin node from a 1TB WD Passport.

I've been trying to get a stable 'simple RPi' setup for awhile now.  Most of the (inexpensive) 128GB flash drives I've tried simply crap out after awhile. The 2.5in portable drives with the USB/SATA HBA built in are backwards compatible with USB2 ports which means they'll operate within the standards 500ma envelope. 12 days uptime and counting on this guy so far:

@_date: 2017-03-12 00:09:36
Not necessarily true.  I have a robot in my basement powered by solar panels (long story).  Whenever it has *excess* power during really sunny days and the battery banks are full... it turns on some USB ASIC miners to cook off the extra power into some TX dust ;-)

You realize this was likely in reference to confirmations ON THE BCC chain.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:35:27
This is really what it comes down to.  I'll never run a pruned node either, but don't begrudge those that need or choose to.  I'm also very fortunate that I live in the developed western nation and have access to fast, unmetered internet.  I have more than one geographically separated full nodes that participate and offer up the whole chain all the way back to the genesis block if needed.  My primary node typically has ~125 connections :-D
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:19:01
Run from a USB2 powered 2.5 HDD. The corruption is due to shitty SD-Cards and IO they're not suited for.

I've recently tried to quantify how much bandwidth this is requiring at this particular site.  It seems to be ~ 1.2 TB / month.  
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:47:48
I've been running a FULL (non-pruned) RPi node at ~3.5W of power w/ 176 days of uptime now.
In fact, it's running both Bitcoin and Litecoin full nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:52:17
Currently 176 days of uptime.  No issues.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:00:45
Do you run your own full node?  Un-pruned and un-shaped?
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:37:21
These are all fair points, but if I'm installing security updates, and checkrestart doesn't indicate anything actually requires a restart... I'm staying up :-/
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:15:06
You mean /s, right?  If I have all security patches applied and nothing represents a known risk, of what benefit is it to me to restart this system?
(Also have a solar powered RPi that ASIC mines using surplus solar enegery with an uptime coming up on a full year ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:57:01
Again, this is likely a 1-use coin.  Existing users who are confident and competent enough are likely to move it to an exchange and dump.
I will be selling 100% of my BCH... *into FIAT*.  I consider it a gift from Bitmain and/or Roger.  Thanks guys :-)
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:48:08
Considering I'll gladly operate an LN hub altruistically... but will need to shut down 2 full nodes if block size increases significantly, I know what the answer is for me personally.

Disagree.  My guess is that those who care enough will only be a 'user' of BCH insofar as moving their balance to an exchange to unload.
Then they are a user no more.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:46:13
As someone who runs three geographic nodes that are unshaped, I'll need to shut down 2 of them if the blocksize increases substantially, so you can fuck right off with your 'garbage argument'

@_date: 2017-04-20 19:26:44
Do I think there should be larger blocks in Bitcoin?  Potentially.  If it's **absolutely necessary and safe** from a *technical perspective*.  Should miners alone be allowed to dictate what these sizes are?  Fuck no.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:43:36

@_date: 2017-04-20 19:31:01
It absolutely is.  Especially when a completely overwhelming amount of the community wants it to activate.
He's also defrauding hardware customers who have *already paid for* scrypt mining hardware that he is apparently delaying shipment of and using himself to prevent SegWit from activating.

Where are the scripts?
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:17:24
It's also critical to them that all transaction data is 'billable' to the end users (even if it's not technically required).  Oh it's also critical that block sizes are allowed to be dynamic... but that's only to allow them to **grow**, as organically needed, they *promise*.  They also surely wouldn't game the mempool of transactions to artificially raise TX fees paid to them either. /s
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:46:59
It's not over yet... Jihan cannot keep up this attack indefinitely.

@_date: 2017-04-27 12:43:46
I did some mulling over the code in the pastebins and really, you can't come to any other conclusion.
1) On some versions (older?) of the miner software there appeared to be a UI setting where this could supposedly be configured and enabled/disabled.
2) In recent/current versions of the software, the values were **hardcoded** into the source and not tied back to the UI configuration in any way.  This code would execute regardless.
How could it *possibly* be argued that this is anything *other* than malicious with just an exceptionally thin veneer of plausible deniability (**not** plausible in my opinion).
I, personally, have very little doubt that this would have been leveraged at some point.
@_date: 2019-04-17 02:36:41
Except I tried to earlier, and cannot due to nonUS credit card.  So no... not anyone.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:13:54


... except that is literally the position Litecoin was forced into.  
Hopefully Jihan faces some form of legal action by the hardware customers he appears to have defrauded as well.
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:58:41
Good God this guy is such a clown.
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:27:25
Because we have a strategic armistice.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:59:49
**THIS**.  I literally watched it happen.  I will never buy Bitmain HW because of it either.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:10:49
This.  The miners want a dynamic blocksize... and guess what? It will spell absolute disaster as far as decentralisation is concerned.
@_date: 2017-04-02 21:45:03
Come join us!
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:09:39
I would say coercion by Jihan and the rest of his miner mafia.
I'm starting to think that having what is effectively a monoculture of SHA256 ASICs is having a very detrimental effect.  
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:00:47
When you withhold products customers have financed to *attack the network* and then offer them the option of either; 1) paying for the electricity used, or 2) getting a refund, then I consider the argument invalid.
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:13:27
You sound like a real winner.  How about you just bow out and let the grownups stand up for what is just.

His name was Dave Kleiman. He's a hero.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:50:36
I've seen this sentiment in multiple places.  The issue here is that this isn't an *ingress* backdoor.  The miner is beaconing *out* to a central server.  Most NAT environments are very likely to be allowing this traffic.  An active network admin with OPSEC on the mind may have caught this *egress* traffic (perhaps how this came to light?), at which point a sufficiently capable router could put in place an *egress* rule to prevent the miner from phoning home, but ultimately one would really want to address the device **attempting to make the call**
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:52:51
Annnd I'm out.  You're an idiot that doesn't deserve assistance.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:35:27
I've been mentioning to others in your sub for a day or 2 now that Jihan is supposedly gaming your hashrate as well.  I'll check my HW tonight to see if I can assist :-) Solidarity, my dudes.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:07:21
Then it's not setup properly?  I have both a BTC core node and an LTC core node running *on a Raspberry Pi* /w 1GB of RAM, without issue, for ~54 days uptime now. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:26:39
Dissenting opinion here.  I think you should go for it.  You are *really* unlikely to be profitable, but it _is_ a fun way to acquire BTC *indirectly*.
You will surely learn a lot, and we **absolutely** need more independent entities mining.
I also personally mine with obsolete hardware *over the winter months* to heat my home and acquire additional coins.
I have a solar project coming up this year that will also use PV solar power to mine scrypt and will be dumping the excess heat into heating my swimming pool.

Excellent write-up.  Only thing I missed myself was '--disable-bench --disable-zmq'.  I should probably check what they are for and whether it mattered.
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:49:38
Perhaps I should clarify; An exceedingly small cabal of people (who just also happen to have exceedingly cheap electricity and access to a silicon foundry) have an extremely disproportionate influence over the PoW mechanism of what was clearly intended to be a fully decentralized technology.  The gross imbalance in this influence needs to be fixed.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:00:41
This is terrific!  Now there will apparently be a SegWit MASF on Litecoin for further analysis in addition to this USAF-BIP148 implementation.
I say *apparently* regarding the MASF on Litecoin because, while the Mining Cartel roundtable finally agreed to a compromise... they haven't actually followed through on signalling.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:00:46
I know I'll never order anything from them again.  I hope Jihan goes to prison for the fraud he's currently suspected of committing. Against customers who have purchased and paid for scrypt miners he's not currently delivering.
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:07:36
Based on the pastebin... I cannot see how this could be anything other than incredibly evil.  It's a centrally controlled kill-switch.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:09:34
Many people are (and have been) trying to improve the situation for quite some time.  Unfortunately, a small cartel of industry scale miners (and hardware foundry) are actually trying to maintain the status quo and actually increase the fees.  This will also centralise the currency and squeeze out smaller actors.  It looks like this:
EDIT: misspelled a word
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:57:52
Oh look!  A few new pools with familiar sounding names have decided that they *only now have an interest* in Litecoin!  Amazing coincidence! 
 
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:17:28
I hope you are correct.
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:58:01
You should probably back that up with something.  *You* may have some irrational dislike for the currency, but that does not make it a scam.

I'm willing to bet that both Jihan and Wang Chun are about to attempt seizing the Litecoin blockchain. /conspiracyhat

They will push for a dynamic block size... and that I will never support.
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:14:43
This is a callback *from* the miner to a central server.  Most NAT setups are likely to permit this.  Now that it's known about, it could be addressed with a traffic **egress** policy, but I'd rather address the behaviour in the miner directly :-S
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:10:13
Who the hell is talking about ASIC boost here?  The fact that this clown is withholding products already sold to end customers for his own personal use under the guise of a 'firmware issue' is fucking criminal and I hope the community boycotts every single damn thing he tries to sell in the future.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:15:57
Yup.  It's absolutely infuriating.  They now appear to be holding activation at about 72%.  This is *not* how things should be and every goddamn sane person in the community knows it.

In the event of a coordinated 51% attack on the blockchain a single actor with the ability to manipulate (with a MAC whitelist/blacklist I may add) 70% of the hashing power could be absolutely disasterous.  
@_date: 2019-04-17 02:39:05

@_date: 2017-04-27 16:17:02
The fact that customization and enable/disable is divorced from the UI completely is pretty damning to me.  If it was ever intended to be a 'feature', any rational developer/company would have at least had some control exposed so someone could opt-out.  The fact that just isn't in place is pretty much unforgivable.

Indeed.  As I have.  No KYC up to 1BTC/day.  Also, use a VM to run the Electrum wallet to sweep your (BTC-less) private keys.

This doesn't strengthen the network itself... which is pretty critical.

Perhaps a 2MB increase in a few years after the efficiency and effects of all other technical improvements have been studied.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:58:21
My theory is that... well, the  ones who are going to try out LN on mainnet (guilty) probably have by now... and have gone and purchased all their stickers and other swag.  In order to claim these funds (at this point in time), the actual merchants need to occasionally close their channels and settle the BTC on-chain (I'm guessing that these are the occasional, recognizable drops in channels and capacity anyway).

Aren't the refund transactions signed by both parties prior to the funding of the initial channel?
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:16:13
Completely agree.  Monocultures are bad.  I run a mix myself.  Desktop client (which I transact with) was upgraded to 16.0 for ease of Segwit use ;-)

Curious enough to request some elaboration.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:36:03
Okay... but then they wouldn't really be setting up a 'lightning channel' per se as far as I'm aware... Just a strange, manually baked multi sig contract? (In which case... uhhh... sure, throw your money away?)  I don't believe this situation would be possible running any of the lightning projects currently being developed (at least I hope not anyway).
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:13:39
You sure about that?  I'd like to hear the technicals on how that would play out.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:38:30
Give me information of this 'i2p' and I'll consider running a full node on it myself.
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:04:39
This is not a real scaling solution.  Superior efficiency gains need to be realized elsewhere first (which is finally happening).  Massive increases in block size will have an adverse effect on P2P decentralization.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:10:42
No.  Unless you are running your own fully validating full node... you are NOT being responsible for your own funds and are fully trusting a 3rd Party.  Without geographically diverse, independent full nodes, the P2P decentralized nature of Bitcoin ceases to exist.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:34:05
Congrats!  If they are still there once your all sync'd up, I'd say the value more than justifies picking up a good hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano, etc..) and get them secured and offline!
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:40:36
It's never 'gone forever', thankfully.  It either eventually goes through, or eventually times out of the mempool and will show as available again on blockchain.info account.  i.e. - If the TX times out, Blockchain.info absolutely *should* make it available to you again.  If they don't, it's **they** that have some 'splainin' to do. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:09:33
I mine bi-annually when it makes sense.  I heat my home in the winter with nothing but mining equipment.  I even mine with obsolete HW that otherwise wouldn't turn a profit.  I wring my electricity through it anyway... take the cozy Watts/BTUs and hodl.
As soon as something is even *remotely* comparable to BitMain HW (looking at you Japan) and not from a complete shitbag enemy of Bitcoin, I'll invest in that hardware for that season.

Not sure about anyone else... but I'll likely also be quite generous in my TX fees for a while as well.

I'm with you on this.  Updoot.  I was wondering the same thing and asking around the IRC channels as well.

Cool beans.  It looks like I was one of the nodes he connected to.  Appears to have moved a not-insignificant amount of satoshis too!
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:11:55
What reputation?  I fail to see how it can be diminished any further.
BCash has a grand mal seizure every few days due to EDA, which is driving crazy inflation.
Hardly ANYONE is using this chain, except for perhaps miners that are exploiting the aforementioned mechanism.
It's painfully obvious this is going to continue too.  Until when?  Thinking of that... I should go check when it halves next.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:04:04
If you control your own private keys... I recommend simply holding.  You won't 'choose' either/any fork.  You'll have a stake in both/all of them.  Revisit in 6 months.  It's likely that only one will win out... and probably make considerable gains.  If the other is still alive, you could choose to simply sell those coins off for some residual gains.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:54:20
Do it homie.  I risked $5K on GPUs to start mining in the fall of 2012. Kept it quiet to myself for nearly a year.  Acquired quite a stack for myself... but would have been significantly more had I purchased directly :-S.  It's a crazy world out there.  Take the risks you think you can overcome should they go worst-case.  All the best.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:12:08
I think the logistics of getting this much hashpower to *functionally* pull off said attack is actually quite unlikely.  I'm certainly not an expert, but at numerous points the BTC:BCH hashrate was at 98:2 or even greater, so it begs the question as to why *some group, somewhere* hasn't attempted such an attack against the BCash chain.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:30:54
This most definitely sounds like a block storage (hardware) issue on your end.  I haven't had to restart or reindex in months.

It is likely safe to assume that anyone truly running their own authentic Bitcoin nodes is likely *not* doing so from an AWS instance.  I could be wrong, and there could be exceptions, so I'd love to hear from anyone that may be.

No, not specifically... but proportionally yes.  Shortening the time has a definite impact on security.  I read a decent article on some theory that argued that this is literally associated to p2p distribution and the physics of the speed of light, but I.... definitely can't find it 8PM on a Saturday night :-P.

@_date: 2018-04-23 22:19:28
I'm supporting any new vendor with a minimum 0.03 BTC channel... so long as I can. :-)  Bring 'em on.

" If it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling you're making a difference, great. But from what I can tell, everything would be exactly the same without one extra node- you're inconveniencing yourself while providing negligent benefits to others." 
If this was the prevalent mindset of everyone, there would practically be no P2P bitcoin network.  The network is stronger and more resilient the more nodes there are.  
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:17:48
I'm with ya.  This is why I've been pinning up many hundreds (of equiv $) into my own channels in support of any vendors that turn up nodes on the mainnet.

100% This.  I actually made it to the bottom ('cause try to evaluate the whole thing and all), but could have saved my time.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:45:14
No, not at all.  I'll pin up channels to large vendors as it increases my own ability to send payments throughout the network, as well as facilitate others transactions to the vendor in question (and hopefully grind a handful of satoshis in the process)
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:52:00
... and this is likely still possible, and then some.  Unfortunately, Bitcoin is at an impasse as to how to progress technically.  Until this is overcome, it's going to remain the status quo.
I have a feeling once the technical solutions available in SegWit are realized in Litecoin, there will be additional pressure on obstructionists.

This. Need more details.

@_date: 2017-05-05 16:43:51
Okay, and that can be evaluated when the time comes.  First step should really be to get the basic on-chain transactions as technically efficient as possible.  All future block size increases are then amplified by this factor.

I will gladly take it.

Yes.  The equivalent of spending your own funds to create artificial scarcity in an attempt to strengthen your own argument.

This!  Take the concept of the most amazing 64k demo scene work you've ever seen, then imagine you gave THAT artist/programmer 128K to work with.
Getting things as technically efficient as possible *prior* to throwing additional capacity at the problem **IS** the way forward.  
Does SEGWIT not provide the same (or improved) level of security while utilizing less traditional block space?  If this is true, it's the obvious way forward.
