Like you said greed was the main reason for most, but others simply weren't educated on how it operated and others thought they could use it to catch up to the early Bitcoin adopters.
@_date: 2017-03-28 03:28:03
You should be good using localbitcoins, I've used it before. Only thing is high exchange rates, and use someone with 100% feedback. If you don't get your BTC charge back.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:03:30
It isn't complicated though, just don't keep your coins on exchanges always send them to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:45:23
I wouldn't contact them, didn't you get $10 in BTC for the referral?
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:26:19
A normal person that don't want a MT. Gox to happen to them will...
@_date: 2017-03-28 03:07:23
I wouldn't ever recommend selling your BTC for PayPal as the buyer could charge back with PayPal..
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:00:34
Localbitcoins is one site I know of
@_date: 2017-03-28 02:51:22
Localbitcoins is the only site I know to use PayPal 
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:51:24
I've seen this car posted here before lol 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:01:01
I've watched this documentary like 6 times already, love it..
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:24:28
Too bad it's for Bitconnect... Stop promoting your scam here.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:23:02
Unfortunately yes, the exchange most likely kept them when they shut down.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:05:36
Watched this many times, great documentary..
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:38:05
300k USD most likely 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:39:38
I hate changelly and it's company... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:34:57
Not true, because in order to move your coins from a paper wallet you'd need to import you private keys to do so. 
Hardware wallets are completely offline &amp; it doesn't require you to expose your private keys to send anything, just plug it in &amp; send.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:27:37
Get a ledger or trezor hardware wallet, that's your safest bet.
@_date: 2017-04-16 03:06:35
Never thought about that one... I have thought about all the people who have lost access to their wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:51:56
Not that I know of, I also wouldn't recommend buying elsewhere as the hardware can be tampered with if you buy from a sketchy source.
ledgerwallet.com is the safest place to buy.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:47:37
It could hit 500k years from now, but not anytime soon. Especially if BTC forks..
@_date: 2017-04-18 22:38:22
Honestly you shouldn't.. Anyone can chargeback when using PayPal leaving you scammed.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:47:38
I really hope Bitfinex wins, that way other banks don't think they can do this as well... 
@_date: 2017-04-13 12:14:34
The domain registery info is public, so that's a start to finding them.
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:07:02
If someone had 500 BTC at the price now it would be over $500k, an if the price drops to $20 it would be worth around $10k. So no they won't be as rich bc they don't have half a million anymore.. Just 500 BTC worth $20 a coin.
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:30:21
When I buy coins on Coinbase I get them instantly..
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:35:27
Why gamble with money that will "change your life" if you loss it...? Sounds like you learned a lesson to me. Lol 
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:12:33
Yes, like if the USD drops Bill Gates would still be the richest man in the world. If you have 20 BTC and I have 10 BTC you would still have double what I have.
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:00:10
Sounds like a sketchy site regardless..
@_date: 2017-04-13 12:29:01
Could be, but I just took a look at the email which seems to be real as it's been in 6 data breaches.. One of them being BitcoinTalk were he's promoted his site under the username 'bitbet-info'.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:37:04
I'm almost positive Gemini.com can, but I could've sworn coinbase just started selling in NY.
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:37:59
I use GDAX which is owned by coinbase, why not just use GDAX &amp; get them instantly.
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:59:09
GDAX is owned by coinbase, read... 
@_date: 2017-04-16 06:23:43
GDAX is owned by coinbase, but it allows you to buy btc instantly. You can also use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:42:56
You can't withdraw to PayPal with coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:35:22
This is still the beginning, just hold tight &amp; don't panic.

Very nice looking! 
One thing id request is a night mode so when I'm laying down at night I'm not getting blinded by the white background.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:54:00
You better hodl a girl like that!
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:07:27
Because it just happened when he tried to move to his hardware wallet, if it was the paper wallet they would've taken the coins a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:53:19
After $5555
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:20:24
Not FUD, they have valid points.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:36:01
Very nice, I really like the stats of market cap etc on bottom of the first image. Very useful for when you aren't home.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:29:16


Yes but that's how scams work, everyone gets paid until they decide to close up shop. 
What amazes me is all the people invested in this don't even know how this company operates or makes their money.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:52:22
That's cool &amp; all... but Genisis Mining??

Same, I love jaxx.io wallet.. but I don't feel safe with it on my phone.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:08:17
For Bitcoin, jaxx supports multiple tokens which is why I like it.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:37:38
Rule  Don't keep your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:28:47
LMAO "dealing with a dark Web criminal pro" 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:08:26
GDAX is coinbase's exchange &amp; yes you can deposit USD then buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:26:46
Coincap.io is like CoinMarketCap
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:50:33
Coinbase or Gemini
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:34:52
 lot of people show off their purchases on here, but a lot also like privacy.. Someone bought a house with their earnings about a month ago &amp; like last week someone posted a new boat they bought.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:18:29
Yes, you log into coinbase and go to your BTC wallet &amp; your transaction info should be there. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:59:58
gyft.com sells gift cards to many places which you can pay in bitcoin.
