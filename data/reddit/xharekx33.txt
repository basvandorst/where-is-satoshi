they just changed the minimum limit yesterday. It is 0.0001 BTC now

adding the fiat currency symbol next to the valuation would definitely improve the UX, so you are not forced to look left again in case you forget whether you are looking at btc/eur or btc/usd or whatever
Apart from that, i think it's looking pretty damn neat. Looking forward trying it.

So, if I leave my BTC for the moment in Coinbase so they handle the split for me, and as soon as possible I sell my B2X, buy more BTC and then immediately move my BTC away from Coinbase... 
1) isn't it an easier, safer way to handle it all given the whole replay issue than trying to figure it out on my own with whatever wallet I use? Seems like a good option for us newbies. 
2) will any of these operations result in B2X gaining hashpower power over BTC? (In understand B2X accumulated value should go down I we all start dumping it, but the accumulated hash power thing confuses me)

Apple is not an internet company at core. It's a hardware maker

was their hardware division from 1998 was behind their spectacular valuation then?

Yeah, apparently I had a brain fart when re-redacting that to minimize my sass and my writing was less than stellar. I do want this to be a productive discussion but sometimes my smartass side takes the best of me. Sorry. 
The point still stands, though. If you read the article carefully they are making the distinction I refer to. The first half talks about old school tech companies like microsoft and intel, etc. The second half about newer, internet-based ones like Yahoo. There is a clear difference between the two and Warren's stated reason for not investing in each of them. 
Obviously an article with a couple short quotes is a poor proxy from which to know his real reasons. But in the absence of a better source...

Apple deals with atoms. Warren's definition of internet companies is those that only deal with bits, therefore have a way less solid foundation because bits are intangibles, have (in theory) lower barriers of entry and therefore are more prone to sudden disruption. This makes them a less attractive investment opportunity for him

Yeah, making a bunch of addresses was the first solution that came to my mind, but it felt strange that the wallet article didn't mention it.
thanks a lot for the help, it really was informative.
