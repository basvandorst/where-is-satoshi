Those companies minimized their tax payments. It's absolutely legal to do that if you work in multiple countries and obey the laws and tax rules of each. It's just a matter of shuffling money between countries in the right way.
Evading tax means not paying what you legally have to.
The whole worldwide tax system is rigged to allow wealthy people and companies to avoid tax. Nobody with influence wants to change a system that lefts them off a large tax bill. It's immoral and it's disgusting and it should be changed, yet nobody will change it.

Same in Iraq.

Have you read paypal's terms and conditions? It's your right to get your bank to take back fraudulent transactions, but if you do that to paypal they will first try to extract that money from every linked account and second send debt collectors after you. They really do that as a matter of routine.
Ironically their debt collection agencies tend to be more reasonable than they are. If they know they can't win in court they tend to back off.

I agree it's a health problem. Anything that results in freer access to chemicals that cause a health problem doesn't sound like a good idea. I absolutely hate the idea of limiting the freedom of right-thinking people by banning them from taking whatever they like. However I hate the harm done by drug addicts considerably more. Addicts would still do illegal and harmful things to get money for drugs even if those drugs were legal.
You have to balance the freedom of right-thinking people to do whatever they like against the freedom of right-thinking people to not be robbed or manipulated by those who became addicts. I believe addicts should have their rights removed before right-thinking people.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:15:06
What paypal did to me was transfer a small amount to USD and back at a bad rate, then add debt collector and administration fees, then demand I pay that far bigger number. The starting amount they tried to rob from me was only a little over $100.
I'd feel safer mailing cash now than having anything to do with paypal. There are many thousands of ex-paypal users who feel the same.

I'd define an addict as someone who has been convicted of theft or violent crime in order to buy drugs. It's not a perfect definition but at least it's measurable and should cover practically all addicts who are a menace to society. The problem isn't even addiction, it's addicts harming others. Everyone should be free to harm themselves.
The government banned drugs because there is nothing they can do once a person becomes a criminal addict except spend a fortune housing that person in prison. Rehab costs a fortune and fails far more often than it works.

I absolutely agree. I've been modded to hell for asking innocent questions and trolled like crazy. I had the whole XT project down as one big troll until I found some very reasonable posters who explained what the hell was going on. I was wrong in ever thinking they were just trolling but that was the only message I was receiving.
I don't know of any way to avoid this on a platform where anyone can contribute. The only solution that might work is a subreddit that has mods that rigorously defend free discussion regardless of that discussion being pro-core or anti-core whilst banning trolls like crazy.

It looks likes it's already been tried by the adopt-a-node project that mentioned elsewhere in this thread. I really don't think anyone wants to give money to a stranger on the internet in return for a promise that they will do something.

Still not getting how handing masses of land to ISIS is good for the stability of the middle east. Say what you like about Assad, Saddam, and the Taliban but they are/were far less dangerous than ISIS is right now if for no other reason than they were never a unified group. If the US does manage to remove Assad ISIS would soon crush those rebels and grow even more powerful. The US caused a massive problem with its pointless wars and funding of terrorist groups. Good job Putin can think further ahead than the next election.

That's why I don't want Satoshi uncovered. He is going to be a human full of flaws and weaknesses and moral ambiguity. People will pick over everything he has done and paint a whole personality out of anything remotely objectionable they find. They will invent motives and character flaws that never existed and rant and rave about them.
Look at Nietzsche. All most people remember is that he went insane and died of syphilis.

It lets them relay transactions to the network faster. If you startup a node just when you want to send a transaction it can take a while to get your transaction out. Not everyone trusts light clients like Electrum.

But then they would need to correlate bitcoin transactions with IP connections, which means deep packet inspection. And they would have to do it for every electrum (or whatever) server as the client may automatically rotate which server it uses.  The servers will be spread over multiple countries.
It's theoretically possible but impractical. And that's not even taking proxies, tor, or open wifi points into account.

None of the altcoins bring anything new to the table. They are just Bitcoin with a new name, new timing values, or a different hash function. There is nothing at all new about Litecoin or Dogecoin.

This could have all happened because GOX could not have expected the scale of fund seizures or the costs of sending duplicate transactions. Throw in some other unexpected costs and they are in serious trouble.

If you hate the book write another one. Don't knock the publisher because they don't or didn't agree 100% with everything you believe in.

Andreas is doing great stuff. BitCoin needs a book so that people that don't know about it can learn about it. If you want to write a better book you would be doing the community a great service too. There is plenty of room for 2 or 3 books.
Any criticism of O'Reilly as a publisher doesn't belong here. It's not fight.

Children, addicts, and some mentally ill people are not able to make responsible decisions. You are also ignoring the many people addicts harm in order to get money for their habit and the violence that comes with the supply side of many drugs.
I agree the US does bad things, that's some other discussion though.
If you could come up with some system to supply ethically grown or created drugs only to those who are responsible and knowledgeable enough to use them without harming others I'd support it. I'd be very strongly in support of anything that enhanced people's freedom whilst raising some tax money and cutting policing costs at the same time. Personally I can't think of any workable way to do this.

The cost of carrying out a 51% attack is truly massive. You would have to either buy enough hash power to match the entire current network or subvert multiple mining pools and cut them off the main network somehow without the miners noticing and switching pool.
Unless you have some magic way to split a massively connected peer2peer network it's basically impossible to pull off a 51% attack no matter how well funded you are.

All of this has been answered before but I'll answer quickly in the hope you want serious answers.


It's not that bad, mining is done on relatively low power and high performance ASIC hardware now. Look at all the electricity the VISA and Mastercard networks use, all the electricity used by millions of ATMs on 24/7, all the high powered POS terminals and so on.


It's easy to steal them only if people don't protect them. It's digital cash. Almost all the theft is by confidence scams or from sites run by people who don't have the security background to run services that handle money.


It's very hard and expensive for law enforcement to investigate murders, muggings, smuggling, or countless other things. Law enforcement can do hard and expensive things.


That's not a fault, it's by design. If you destroy cash your money is gone too. Have you never had your credit card locked after you make an unusual but perfectly valid transaction? I have maybe 5 times. Then I have to spend ages on a mobile often at international rates to get it unblocked. That would never happen with BitCoin. Also there are plenty of people who can't get credit cards anyway. don't get me started on the way credit cards are used to trap people into debt either. With BitCoin you can't spend what you don't have.

Deep packet inspection on a worldwise scale. Attacks on the TOR network, timing attacks or network disruption attacks are possible. Getting disk images or network dumps off every TOR node either by legal or illegal means. Social engineering against DPR himself. Illegal surveillance against everyone running a TOR node. Investigations and possible surveillance of everyone active on bitcointalk.org. A genuine technical mistake on the site is always possible but exploiting that mistake but not be legal.

Just so it's clear I'm objecting to catching transactions on the network, not to a double confirm wrapper-like setup.
What you seem to want is what some banking websites do. You enter your transaction and submit it. Then you review it and send it. A totally separate person should do the last step in normal companies.
It's an easy change to the client or a simple wrapper around bitcoind that does its stuff then calls whatever submits the transaction to the network proper. It would be pretty easy to do this whole thing with the SX tools and the scripting language of your choice.

It's a problem when I want to buy a second hand car from a private individual. I could do a bank transfer but I don't know the guy to trust him and want to transfer the money and the car at the same time.
Or you might want cash for a vacation. It's often cheaper to change currency abroad or use cash machines abroad, however bank cards are unreliable outside their home country.
Or you might want to pull the 'Do you take credit cards? OK, how much cash discount can you give me?' routine for a big purchase.
There are lots of reasons you might want access to actual banknotes.

I've found bitcoind does need a lot of memory but it doesn't all need to be resident. Loads of swap works nicely as the transaction pool seems to swap out and almost never swap back in. In any case you need to restart bitcoind at least monthly to clean out the transaction pool.
More ram is always the easiest way to improve performance on any unix machine, it's just not absolutely needed unless you can't add swap.

Only it's not perfectly rational. A smaller pool will have higher variance but that doesn't mean lower average income. It's means identical average income. Some days he will generate more and some days less.
Rising difficulty only means his average income will fall over time. It doesn't mean that lower variance pools generate more profit per amount of hash power.
Like practically every other business in the world he should accept that his income isn't going to be perfectly identical every single day and stop harming the ecosystem he relies on.

There are bad reasons why in a lot of cases. Are you saying hard working people who have never ripped anyone off yet have no credit rating should have no access to money?










It's a bad argument. Law enforcement are used to the conventional finance system, it's not really designed to make anything easy for them though as it's a loophole laden mess.






It didn't seem a good thing when I was in a far away place and they locked my card when I tried to pay for a hotel. Sure I can call them but I'm standing in a queue of people and the call costs 1.50 a minute. If it was really my money the bank should not be able to block me from using it.






That fine. Please don't get the impression I'm saying you have to use BitCoin instead of cash or card, use whatever you are happy with. I have still ended up in situations where I have a selection of bank cards and still can't pay for things or find an ATM.

So why invade Iraq then? Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11 and the WMD claims were fabricated by the president at the time. Not the NSA or the CIA who reported factually but the president himself. It's because the massive oil and gas fields under Iran are accessible with the right kind of mining from Iraq. It's called snake mining. Luckily Iran never gave the US any provocation at all and has steadfastly followed the path of peace recently.
Why destabilize Libya? Because Gaddafi planned to sell oil for gold and setup some kind of united stated of Africa. The US destroyed a whole country to prevent that happening and painted this guy who was probably only partially mental as a total loony.
Why go to massive lengths and highly dangerous lengths just to undermine Assad? Seems he had a deal to build an oil pipeline with Iran, something that would undermine US control of oil. You know that Assad's Syria is a sectarian state and the US is actively working to turn it into an Islamic dictatorship?
Destabilizing Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia, and a lot of Syria created a massive power vacuum that ISIS predictably took advantage of. Well done US, you just created a monster. Good job Russia is there to clean up your mess.
Nobody cares what China sells oil for because they don't sell outside their own country. They use all they can dig up.
Nobody can do anything about Russia because they are too powerful and they are not really undermining global oil trade anyway.
Looks like the US is going to lose against Syria. And rightly so, Syria isn't anything like North Korea or any other crazy-state. That BS about Assad using chemical weapons, even if true, is absolutely nothing compared to what the US did to Vietnam in a pointless war that the US started for absolutely no reason.

Anyway forbidding people to use drugs isn't really effective but banning supply limits supply and limits the problem to some extent. It's not fully effective but it's all the government has to work with. The reddit alternative of letting everybody have everything would probably be far worse.

Anarchy does not mean selfish, it means without leaders.
BitCoin is P2P. It's literally anarchy, which is a good thing in this context. It's in no way democratic as no part of the system is one-person-one-vote.

You are not wrong but you are missing some of the story. It's rather more complex than that. An easy supply of hard drugs does cause some people to harm themselves and harm others. Some people, maybe even most, could be responsible drug users. Some can't and society has to repair the damage caused by their behavior.
It's a balancing act between preserving your freedom to do what you want and preserving your freedom not to be robbed by junkies who will do anything for their next fix. Your point that the government is motivated by big money so don't get the balance right is dead on, but the extreme of legalizing everything isn't a perfect solution.

I don't claim to have reviewed all the information here but it seems both the seller and localbitcoins are complicit in fraud. Localbitcoins should know better than to alter the terms of someone else's contract once it has been agreed by both parties.

They found the man by the aliases he used on bitcointalk and other sites. Then found out what hosting providers he sent money to. That's your server.

Because SR had no way to validate who the buyers were. The whole point of the site was that nobody knew who the sellers were, and only the sellers knew who their buyers were.

The guy would have happily sold heroin and meth to children and people that didn't have a clue how to use it safely.

Maybe. There is no way to be sure.
It was certainly possible to find this guy by old fashioned investigative work though. Simple seizing TOR nodes and at random would have found him eventually, there are no more than a few thousand in existence.

I was suggesting a dumb approach would have worked eventually. If I was the police I'd get a list of all the tor nodes from  cut out the low bandwidth ones, cut out the political organizations, cut out the windows nodes, and investigate the others one by one starting with those hosted anywhere that has expensive bandwidth.
Maybe they did this and found Freedom hosting by accident.
I can't rule out your theory that the TOR network itself may be compromised though. Treating it as compromised seems sensible.
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:07:35
It is not an uneducated complaint. SSL CAs have been abused by the NSA and by private agencies in the past. Signing certificates have been leaked and accidentally given away many times. This isn't just a theoretical risk but a real one.
Having said that it's a far smaller risk than using a BitCoin client on a windows machine that may be running any kind of malware. It's a totally acceptable level of risk for normal sized purchases.

That's called security though obscurity and it's no security at all. You don't need the code to find the holes. Look at the endless security problems with Microsoft Windows to see how security though obscurity just doesn't work.

Is it paranoia or is it reality? Thanks to the NSA no-one knows anymore.
He could have been found by legit means even if we can't be sure that he was. One thing the police are amazing at is throwing crazy amounts of manpower at problems.

The FBI have extensive experience in coming up with the "what else". He will give a shit when it makes the difference between looking forward to getting out at the age of 65 or realizing he will be spending the rest of his life locked up.

Lots of otherwise good people end up drug addicts or die though accidental overdose. My attitude is that this is a tragedy. It looks like the prevalent attitude here is 'fuck those losers'.

It works, but you need to make sure you are encrypting your data with the public key of the person you are sending the data to. You can't really be sure that's the case if you have a third party website passing messages between the two of you.

Paypal would like that. It would give them a chance to screw you and keep the payment like they do with USD.

I agree with the above. The rest of the world stopped using checks in the 80's. These days you can make bank transfers for no charge from anywhere in Europe to anywhere in Europe in 1 working day. Within the same country transfers often take an hour or less.

Ross knew the site was setting drugs, that's what he set the site up to do. It's not like he was running a site that sold books and some people were secretly shipping crack with their copies of Harry Potter. He directly facilitated the drug trade and he did it deliberately. He knew full well that what he was doing allowed addicts, children, and people with no clue to get hold of dangerous stuff like meth, crack, and heroin.
The USPS is a common carrier. It doesn't advertise itself as a system to distribute drugs and it carries a lot more legal stuff than illegal stuff. If the USPS gets a whiff of anything illegal it will report it immediately. It's a bad comparison.

What do they mean by 'Critical mass of targets use TOR'?
What are they looking for? Surely the NSA is not really that interested in drug dealing sites. Law enforcement could find plenty of drug dealers at a far lower cost just by nosing around bad neighborhoods and putting pressure on addicts.
Are there actual terrorists on TOR? Because I was under the impression real world terrorists used disposable calling cards and minimal communication instead of this high-tech stuff.

The guy's a drug dealer and apparently a murderer. Don't feel sorry for him. If he has 600K BTC it's going to do him no good if he spends the rest of his life locked up. He will give up the key to the FBI sooner or later.

They don't give customers a choice, they do hold funds for 180 days and after that MAYBE you will get them back and maybe not. There are lots of cases where innocent people who broke no laws got their funds stolen and kept by paypal. And they have been known to bounce pretend debts from currency to currency to bump up the amount then try and take that from linked credit cards and bank accounts, I've seen it happen.
Just because they tell people they 'investigate' doesn't mean they do, sometimes they just steal the money.
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:17:37
That's odd, because I have brought SSL certs with nothing more than a valid credit card and the ability to answer webmaster emails.
