The way that CoinPocket was developed, it only keeps one key pair at a time (public and private key to a single address).
The next feature I'd like to add is the ability to show the private key as a QR code from the tools menu, and then you could send it directly to your printer from your phone.
Then, the next time the app gets to the welcome screen where it generates the key pair (and you could always force the app to do this by clearing your Safari data form the settings app), there would be an additional option to scan a private key to use instead.
It seems much better to me to backup your key this way instead of relying on storing it inside an iTunes backup. Sometimes you need to clear your Safari data for other reasons... and if CoinPocket needs to generate a new address each time that happens, then it seems unusable for the general public.

Yes, that's why I'm not really putting much effort into hosting it myself.
I'm doing the "fork and pull" method. The only reason I mentioned that this fork isn't hosted is because there's currently no way a Reddit user can look at the new features without cloning my repo or until enriquez merges and updates his server.

Thanks for your support :)
I will look into creating a copy for testnet. It shouldn't be too involved. But in all honesty, the changes I've made for affect any of the core code. I'm simply adding new pages to the app... so everything should still function like the original app.

I just used the "fork and pull" method. It allows me to maintain my changes to the repo independently of the original, and doesn't require close collaboration between me and the original developer.
I just submitted a pull request. If he merges, then it will become official CoinPocket functionality.

UPDATE: I have created a GitHub.io Pages branch for the repo. You can now view the new fork by visiting: 
You can confirm that the code is legitimate by looking at the "gh-pages" branch of the repo:

Well, that might actually be a lot of work. Since CoinPocket only stores a single key pair, then it currently isn't possible to import a bunch of keys at one time.
Also, all the code that handles transactions uses just that single key pair, so there is nothing in place that grabs a bunch of unspent outputs from several addresses and creates a single transaction from them.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:14:51
All the transaction signing happens in Javascript within the app itself running in the browser (I can confirm this because I can see the transaction signing code). The signed transaction is then sent to Blockchain.info to be relayed to the miners. So, the private key and public key are never exposed to any outside servers.
The server is simply there so that your phone can load up all the Javascript code that runs the app.

Maybe. I'm not sure. I know the dev is going to want to go in a different direction than I want to, but I'm not sure what to do about the name either.
All I'm doing is adding the features I want in the app. If there's enough support behind it, then I might take on more advanced coding. At that time it might need a new name.

Yes, that's actually because the web app is programmed to not show the QR scan button when it is added the the home screen.
I was just doing some testing and found out that the reason for that is because when is launched from the homescreen, the scanning feature goes back to Safari instead of back into the web app (you can test this by going to "Tools" and checking the balance of an address).
And yes, the reason it does this is because of Apple. I will probably add something to this app so that if it is launched from the homescreen then it will use a Javascript scanning feature instead of the QR app.

Yeah, that's the main reason I forked it. I liked the idea of using a native app combined with an HTML5 app to do QR scanning on an iPhone, but I wanted full control of my keys.
And I see what you mean by the complexity. I think the dev is trying to add an email backup feature, but I don't see that as being any more secure than printing your QR code straight from your phone to your own printer. Also, I'm going to be adding some user-friendly text to the printout to aid a user in restoring it in case their phone data is lost.
I think it's pretty intuitive. You have a secret code that allows you to spend. If your phone ever needs to be restored, then instead of letting it generate a new code, scan in your old. Seems pretty straightforward to me.
Combine that with the next feature I want to add (BIP32), and it's pretty secure as well.

Cool, thank you. :) I've sent a pull request already.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:04:43
Haha... seriously. I'm not sure why the original dev went with using RoR for this app since the actual RoR framework isn't used at all it seems. Oh well...
But thanks, man. :)

For the iPhone QR scanning to work, you need to make sure you have the "Scan Code - QR Code Reader" app from the App Store. If you have the CoinPocket app open in your iPhone, just click that link and it will take you to the app in the app store.
There's also a little square "i" icon right next the the "scan code" button that will take you to that app as well.
Also, it seems like it should work for scanning a payment request and auto-populating the address and amount fields.
