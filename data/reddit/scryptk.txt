CNBC scammed me again...!
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:23:33
They were in an exchange lol, I didn't owned the private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:28:01
General hype about the price going high, that's about it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:00:32
Wow, that comparison... is just... perfect
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:22:42
Both, At the moment it's more an investment, but I hope that in a near future crypto make this world better.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:50:21
I feel fucking excluded.

Bitcoin is unstoppable.


@_date: 2017-08-03 14:51:47
I owned 2,7 bitcoin back then... sold it out for the exact amount of 49,72$. I don't regret it. We learn from our mistakes and greed. This 49$ was a 400% gain for me. I was thinking that I should have bought more, my profit would have been insane. Later on i bought 5 btc at 73$ and sold at 120$. Still don't regret it, these small wins that could have been way more are now the reason I am proud to be a bitcoin holder. We don't always get lucky, but when you buy it based on faith and it explode, you also get pride from it, telling you friends, "I told you guys".

This one comes from a video, he said it on live interview.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:25:45
Block increase of 2MB is the next planned Hard fork in a couple of weeks if everything goes right, then the lightning network in a couple years and bitcoin adoption by the majority of the population another couple year after it. Here is the perfect scenario.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:38:35
You can also just wait, it'll come back into your wallet soon

I've been thinking this since I've seen the 3200$ Memes, and there we are at 3,800$.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:45:30
No because as they purchase, the price will rise and rise.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:37:39
It's the first one created, and it is more widely used around the world than any other Crypto.

It is neither a bad thing neither a good thing IMO... 2x comes with his Pros and Cons.

Hey, I pay 0.05 cents, and not I don't make a loss, actually I make really good profits.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:39:27
Lots of investing firms are getting interested in bitcoins lately.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:18:19

My best bet would be Cryptopia
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:10:14
Yeah hahaha, camps fire and shit, we are burning our GPU boxes since we are also mining a lot XD
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:19:06
There is already another hard fork planned end of october lol, long life to bitcoin, forks are required for technology upgrades.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:12:59
I'd say risky, but if you plan on holding for a couple years and you can live without that money, I think it is worth a try.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:25:37
You can never be too late, party is never over.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:39:32
HODL till millionaire then spend you bitcoins because they are gonna be accepted everywhere.

This image is wrong, we are not going back down.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:16:10
I lost my BCC but that's my bad, I was to lazy to transfer them. Exchanges are safe, but never leave to much money there, we never now what can happen (look at BTC-e as an example)
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:09:20
Bcash should take some distance
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:56:46
How to not get sued and keep some dignity.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:28:26
At 10k, everyone will say "we are to late too the party" and at 100k their will cry because the party is never over.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:00:39
Just keep your funds till Segwit locks in in few day lol. problem solved
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:16:51
1 BTC = 3750 $ CAD, you are drunk, go home.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:50:37
Yeah time to skip to 1000$ checkpoints lol
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:54:43
Best time to buy bitcoin was 2009, the next best time is always now, because the party's never over.
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:19:58

I agree, they are not coming back. Sorry for you, but lets learn from this, triple check the addresses...
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:55:53
The problem is that you only consider Hashrate, you don't even take a look at power consumption, produced heat and lifetime of the cards.

I don't know why they want Segwit2x that much...
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:03:17
The problem with "unitiated" is that they most likely don't want to understand it... But if you still want to try read this : 


@_date: 2017-08-16 03:41:57
it still does.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:46:51

@_date: 2017-08-13 22:15:02
That's exactly why i don't understand why some people are pushing for S2x.... Short terms thinking...
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:38:47
Your correction is accurate sir.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:32:22
Probably, but lets wait RSI still &gt; 65...

Dude, I love your way of thinking.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:32:36
This is false. It all depend on the algo of the coin you are mining.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:06:55
It is being reviewed, Segwit is only the beginning.

@_date: 2017-08-11 13:20:28
Of course, but nobody knows when and how much. This 300$ increase just proven that you should never try to wait for it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:39:07
No. 2700 look at the picture. This only happened on hitbtc

Big whales have the ability to manipulate the market because not enough of us are in yet.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:12:56
That is exactly what he is doing, taking bitcoin out of hands.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:57:04
Sadly, this is way over evaluated and no even close to happen, pure speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:35:04
It did crash to 2700 for a while.

If I have no choice I will... But this is a couple year from here, Bitcoin will be mainstream and accepted everywhere
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:28:51
Shit, I've been identified.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:53:22
Where is the Bcash? Oh sorry, it's already pumped at max.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:48:23
This is so wrong...

@_date: 2017-08-12 14:59:18
Federal Reserve probably already bought Bitcoins as investment!

Pumping the shit so hard ...

@_date: 2018-06-01 13:54:47
It's wrong, Bitcoin is 100% legal in canada, it's just bank fighting against it, but you are allowed to purchase as much as you want. (As long as you declare it ofc)
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:43:39

@_date: 2017-08-13 20:54:20
Wait till August 21! Segwit will significantly reduce the transaction costs!
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:22:51
Wow. I am making this a poster.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:18:51
You shouldn't invest 1,100$ straight ahead for this reasons, split it in payment per weeks or month to be cost average.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:04:26
52 billion market cap, I don't see any other bitcoin in the list.
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:13:45
Do not try to time the market! Time is money, the longer you wait the more you lose!
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:30:07
Only problem about media now, is that they often report misleading infomations...

Dear CEO, for that same reason, get back to work and craft GPU's faster because there is a big lack of them.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:05:04
I know ;)
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:20:40
I'd say about 20%

This title crushed me...

Dam you right... vegeta memes forever now... we are fuckt
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:54:24
They don't have shit, These Tether token will not be redeemable and btc will have a small correction.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:54:29
I'm all about keeping everyone together tbh, we are all Bitcoin, not trashing on BCH or anything, it's only a security question IMO. Big blocks got in too fast, where they needed? Yes, ofc, transactions fees sucks big time, but with less than 1% of the population using bitcoin yet, we have to give it some time and do it right.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:57:06

Short resume, no ads, no pump, only news of what happened, never writing about price, and I receive them weekly on my email. Also it's about crypto in general so it does help keeping track of major events
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:55:32
Cryptotickerr is already doing this without any bullshit and it's free.

This crisis is all I'm waiting for TBH. People will then start realizing how Fiat is bullshit.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:30:47
He obviously not discovered EDIT
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:05:11
I'm against taking the core devs away, they've did a good job so far!
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:24:45
The answer is simply no, even if I and thousands of people believe in Bitcoins, it is still a volatile and risky market. Don't invest money you do not own, invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:33:36
*kind of people that made me lose any faith I have in humanity. Thanks blockchain for trying to restore it.

@_date: 2017-09-03 19:53:15
I'm happy as long as it is over 49,71$.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:31:07
Man, you just wrote that feeling I never been able to express verbally. Thanks you.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:29:10
you gonna post it 10 times?
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:19:38
Never leave that much in an exchange... As soon as I reached 0.4 btc I realized reading all the btc lost that everyone needs an Hardware wallet, yes its 100$+ for a good one, but common, is it worth losing it all? Many hackers make a living of that money everyone is losing, it's a real issue.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:21:59

It's bigger than that Bitcoin is ownerless P2P system. All those other P2P are platforms owned by companies that can be shutdown and modified any time
