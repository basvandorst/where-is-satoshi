Its probably more helpful to people to post his tweets since it's not quite "backing out".
1.Galaxy is building out a full fledged crypto merchant bank. I have over 30 percent of my net worth in crypto assets.  We have venture bets, ICOs, tokens, investments in funds, mining and advisory.  We also trade very actively.  We are making a large long term bet on crypto.
2. To be clear, we delayed launching a hedge fund with outside investors capital last week because we didn’t like market conditions for new investors.   In no way does it mean we are less bullish the crypto markets.
Last tweet was 7 hours ago.

Coinbase has been funded by Silicon Valley VC money ([ IMO that means its not impossible for it to go broke, but if they were to pull some kind of exact scam like you are describing then there would be consequences. 
VC's know that there is a high risk, but there is risk and then there is getting robbed - exit scam is the latter and you don't fuck over rich Silicon Valley types (they have lawyers and you will likely never raise another round of drinks in tech let alone a round of funding)

Morning, Aus here.
Fucking crazy morning to wake up to as usual (BTC dropped a bit to just off $23.5k and I just watched BCH go from $4k to 6.5k in a literal minute, meanwhile ETH is pretending like nothing is happening haha)
Never change crypto.

Hey bro - check out here too - @_date: 2017-12-19 23:36:00
Bitcoin.com is Roger Ver's website and Roger Ver's project, BCH is a competitor to BTC and so you should remember that he (and others tbh) will tend to 'talk their own book' i.e. they all have bias towards their own projects/preferences. 
The article may be intended to be FUD, to pass itself off as coming from some kind of 'official' BTC channel when really Ver is now quite against BTC in its current form.

That hasn't been my experience tbh - sorry to hear that's been the case for you

I know it's a late reply but I took that to mean - they too were anticipating a correction coming into this period and weren't keen for their new clients to immediately buy into the fund only to have a correction like we are having a few days later. Of course, anyone who is buying into a hedge fund will be well aware of the volatility and risk/will be warned of such by the fund however having it occur in such a short space of time may make people skittish and keen to pull their funds back out ASAP or decide not to invest at all. 
Equally, you can also see this being great marketing for Novogratz' new fund - he publicly announces something like that and then when it happens it means that: A) he looks like he is very in tune with the market and knows what he is talking about when it comes to crypto (he probably does, but this demonstrates it) B) shows that he is looking out for clients in the longer term as he could have just tried to capitalise on the gold rush and take clients money ASAP, instead he holds off and then brings people in. 
Great marketing for a new fund in a space where hedge fund investors are looking for people who know their shit (there probably aren't that many comparative to bonds and other exotic investments for example). That's my view on it anywya.

This was fucking hilarious - lots of great lines in there.

All good bro - that's just my thinking on why it's not a bad thing they held off. I'm also sure you could make arguments as to why it is bad too!
Have a good holiday break and remember to hold! Haha

Seriously though, I've seen the BTC fees issue and mempool stuff mentioned on a bunch of crypto subs - it's not a secret so I'm not sure why people keep going around pretending like it's not being discussed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:40:19
Yeah, but he's long term so will have BTC, BCH and BTG as part of the hardforks. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:32:01
IMO there are a number of reasons:
- BTC has the most established and numerous paths to fiat. Alt's have to go back through basically BTC or ETH at this stage and each time you do that there is risk, slippage and fees. Far simpler to just go BTC to fiat as quickly as you can for eBays case, same for if they use a 3rd party. 
- BTC has the most liquidity in a market that is already a low liquidity market, if this picks up at scale this will be needed
- Doge on the other hand was started as a joke/meme coin as the original developer said
- Doge is no longer being developed and so this means exploits may be found and not fixed etc etc
- BTC has more recognition and acceptance both publicly and in cryptoland
- It has an established history of security and reliability of close to 10 years, large dev community and mining hashpower too 
Not here to shit on other cryptos btw, I know that things are changing with more ETH pairings, growing liquidity etc etc however as it stands now, doing this through BTC or ETH would basically be the only options. 
If Lightening then works as intended, this would also put much of the speed and fees debate to rest too (though we'll have to wait and see)

I've no real problem with it being a memecoin or started as a joke (see article quote below), just that this makes it clearly unsuitable for use in this kind of scenario. The platform needs to be taken seriously and Doge was never intended to be taken seriously. 
As for no longer being developed, you are quite right and I have to correct myself since it seems that whilst the original creator is no longer involved, there are devs who are active on the project. According to the threads I read in the Doge subreddit anyway. 
Started as a joke - "Mr. Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin, was an early fan of cryptocurrency, a form of encrypted digital money that is traded from person to person. **He saw investors talking about Bitcoin, the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, and wanted to find a way to poke fun at the hype surrounding the emerging technology.**
So in 2013, he built his own cryptocurrency, **a satirical mash-up that combined Bitcoin with the Doge meme** he’d seen on social media. Mr. Palmer hoped to use Dogecoin to show the absurdity of wagering huge sums of money on unstable ventures."

awesome - thanks for confirming

I feel like OMG and Omisego might have a similar issue too. E.g. the McD's announcement wasn't the coin it was the company that created the coin as far as I understand it.

I think one of the large exchanges is offering futures on it already

Ha, nah. It was more a joke about how everything he touches seems to go to shit - e.g. Trump mortgage not long before the GFC

Cheers :) that's what I thought!

So the fork has happened - I missed it - it's unclear if replay protection is even on? 
I'd like to move my BTC from exchange to wallet shortly - I assume I can do so safely?
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:31:26
This is going to sound dumb as fuck, but here I am. When you say, spend and replace, isn't there are downside in spending X of BTC when you bought it at say $4200 and then spend and replace a small portion of it at $5600? In effect you are getting less bitcoin for your $ at that later time, meaning you either end up chipping away at your 'investment' or you have to spend more fiat to bring it up to the same number of satoshis you had before?
I'm truly keen to help the whole system function and move and grow for a number of reasons, just want to make sure I understand what the costs are. 
Maybe I'm overthinking it and I should just buy X $ value in BTC (say $80) and then near immediately spend that when I'm wanting to use BTC?

Feel like BD Wong doesn't age!
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:05:15
Oh, you may be correct! 
But if my btc was still on an exchange at the snapshot then I don't think it makes a difference (as my exchange aren't supporting btg)
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:43:52
If Trump endorses it, or worse, says he is starting an exchange or ICO (TrumpCoin) then it's truly time to get out.
