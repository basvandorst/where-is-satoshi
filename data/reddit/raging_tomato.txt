Certainly not going to do that (about posting).

By god’s grace I’m in proper financial condition. I will HODL. Thanks man. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:51:39
I will. I took out how much I invested. 
Don’t know if this futures thing gonna bring the prices down. I kinda stopped caring about it now.

Bought Ripple. Is it worth spending on?
Also they come really cheap.

For some reason even I thought this much money is fake. Now I realize it’s not. ��

I wish I could brag about it. My parents don’t have a clue about what bitcoin is. I want to give them, but they will think this is some illegal money. I’m scared telling anyone about it too.

I am thinking of buying a F1 simulator. I always wanted to experience that. ��

Neither wealthy nor poor. My company gave me bonus so I invested in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:15:08
Probably no. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:56:17
I think I will. ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:55:21
Took my initial investment out. I will HODL for a while. May be buy altcoins as you guys have suggested. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:43:47
Yeah sure in the next few days I’m gonna post in what I spent it on.
