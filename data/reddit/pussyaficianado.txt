I was so pissed they got rid of the Chipotle discount right after I signed up for their debit card.

0.5 cents per “qualified” song with a max of 300 per month. So you’ll be able to make $1.50 per month.

This doesn’t have anything to do with bitcoin, it’s a totally different blockchain based technology.

Let’s use more realistic numbers and say it’s roughly worth $10,200, 2020 dollars, but only has $10,000 buying power of 2019 dollars. Consider that maintaining buying power is a good thing for a currency, it means you didn’t lose anything to inflation. However, it’s a bad thing because it means you didn’t earn any return on your investment except to match inflation. I’d argue it’s done exactly what bitcoin is supposed to do, it stored the value away from the inflation from the central banks, but it’s also possible other investment vehicles did better by matching inflation and gaining some additional value. So you have to decide are looking for investment return or are you trying to hedge out some inflation risk.

If you were as brilliant as Satoshi and you had lost your keys would you care? Probably not, because whatever you invent is likely well enough thought out it could stand on its own and it wouldn’t need the Satoshi name. I’d speculate Satoshi is proud of being Satoshi and remembers his key, but if his key is lost his sales pitch wouldn’t be some desperate plea for people to believe he is Satoshi. I would bet all my btc he’d simply adopt a new nom de plume and let his new creation stand on its own legs, because he really would be Satoshi.

Warren Buffett is not against crypto currencies, he does not understand them or care to understand them. He’d rather own the farm producing the goods people buy with either dollars or bitcoins than he cares about what system you or others use to store cash and move money around.
Edit: in fact his ideology is largely aligned with the bitcoin philosophy, he prefers his money be stored in assets that are not just pieces of paper that the fed is making more and more worthless, hence why he trades fiat currency for ownership of companies and holds onto those companies rather than selling them to get fiat currency.

I’m going to say not the way you want to do it. You could create regular 401ks, and invest in bitcoin funds; but the government doesn’t want you to have direct access to the 401k assets to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. When I was looking into how someone would invest their 401k in small business ownership, it seemed possible to invest in a small business, but you could not run/direct the business, and the equity needed to be held by a third party administrator. I suspect you could hire a lawyer to set it up for you; but the way you’re suggesting doing it seems like the IRS won’t allow yet.

He doesn’t talk about it in terms of morality good or bad, it’s good or bad in the sense of whether it’s sound money backed by an asset, or money that only used government printers and fiat for its backing. If it helps, try to substitute the idea of sound money wherever you see Hayek has been translated as saying good money.

It’s about whether the asset is productive or not. Exxon produces oil, gold sits there and is shiny. It’s the difference between investing in businesses and investing in commodities

If you want a serious explanation, he takes intrinsic value to be that of production. If you want his own words I’ve included them below. The gyst of it is he’d rather own the farm than whatever tokens are being used to purchase the milk, eggs, and wheat, whether those tokens be dollars, gold, or satoshis.
Here is Buffett on how you should think about gold:
“Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.
Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?
Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices. 
A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.
Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.”

I never said all value was due to production, I’m simply explaining how Warren Buffet evaluates value. If you’re simply going to choose to be argumentative and obtuse then have a nice day.
