Hong Kong, Lebanon, who's next? It's inevitable that governments will continue to play the same bullshit games, and it's inevitable that people will figure out that bitcoin is the best response.

short answer: go to an online exchange like coinbase or gemini and follow the directions.
long answer: spend all your free time reading bitcoin articles, listening to podcasts and watching youtube videos for months just to start understand what's going on in the crypto space and what you should do.

A bug or exploit is discovered that causes the price of bitcoin (and confidence in it) to plummet. While the bitcoin community argues about what to do another decentralized crypto fills the void. Good for crypto overall, but sucks if you're left holding btc bags.
