The block chain and the processing power behind it that guarantees the transactions are legitimate is where the value is.

Been trying to do some research on this but can't find anything conclusive. Why doesn't the big block approach work? BCH has lower fees and transaction times, doesn't that mean it's working?
Not trolling, genuinely curious.

This is just what I was looking for thanks.
I guess what I takeaway from this video is that more transactions need to take place off the main chain. How would this be accomplished? Could there be separate ledgers on these side chains that then update to the main chain?

Bitcoins are the gold of crypto, altcoins are pegged to Bitcoin.

Nope, there's more sellers than buyers at current prices which is why the price is going down. Basic S&amp;D

If China bans mining the stock is going to Mars. A mining faucility in Greenland makes perfect sense.

I was trying to build a gaming PC and surprised to see GPUs at 2x MSRP. Now I have 4 GPUs mining on nicehash making 2 mbtc a day.

Small shops need to borrow money more so than the larger corporations which can issue their own debt. I dont believe that bitcoin is a good platform for lending but perhaps there can be an altcoin using smart contracts which can facilitate p2p lending.

Bitcoin is like a stock and crypto are the market. Don't get emotional and attached to your investments if you want to make money. People on this sub will frown upon you for selling but do you want the approval of random people on Reddit or do you wanna make profit?

You can mine eth or zcash with your GPU and monero with your CPU. You may be able to get $1.50 a day before electricity costs.

Bitcoin is good for transferring large amounts, a coin like litecoin would be better for daily purchases.

The issue is that Bitcoin is valued in USD. Fiat currency is likely the greatest scam in history up to this point. Future generations will look back on the current monetary system like we look back on the power of religion. Money has replaced Jesus. Anyone living in modern society believes in money enough to devote the majority of their life to accumulate it. It has the power to dictate your standard of living. A system this powerful should not be controlled by people. Bitcoin is the best monetary system out there. Computers are not corrupt like people.
