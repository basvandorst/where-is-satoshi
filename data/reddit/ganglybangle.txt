Ahh cool. Neo was what got me into it all actually, when it was antshares in 2017.
Qtum has the upcoming x86 thing though hey.

I feel like qtum has a great shot of doing really well. The team behind it have really laid off on shilling it, they are making a product for the business world, not a coin to make people money.
Skycoin could be something amazing, feels like a long shot but it's good if you like I gamble I think. Same with dadi.

What is this about?
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:53:00
Qtum, because of it's ability to have smart contracts written in a range of programming languages.
Vechain, because of it's real world applications with combating fraud.
Skycoin or Even Dadi, which can host a decentralized internet, pretty much the holy grail of where the internet should go.
Monero, because it's privacy oriented.
Golem, because it can be used to pay for and encourage decentralised super computer capabilities for anyone that needs such a thing.
And I feel positive about Neo simply because it could be one to earn some money on with it being one of the main coins that will be used in China, it's also a smart contract one.
There's coins that are simply currency, then there's ones that have application. Bitcoin is pretty much a currency, and the most well known one so it's got that going for it, the most support and the most interest in making it work.
There's definately room for more than one hey, just having one blockchain currency is certainly not a good idea.

Kill alts? Why?
There's loads of different applications, loads of different ideas being presented in all them other alts.
I try  and ignore this pathetic tribalism within the cyrptocurrency world, but sometimes I just have to call it out.

Thinking that we are pathetic and stupid, whilst tempting and even helpful in a way, does nothing for your own well being and mood. Be more forgiving and understanding I say. Forgive yourself for your own mistakes. Forgive us for the fallibility of being human. Live with the love that you wish to see in the world. All the negativity out there is born from negative feelings inside us, adding to them by feeling that we are pathetic and stupid only adds to it.
