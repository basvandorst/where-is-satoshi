Surprised it’s not higher given those choices.  No one wants bonds or gold, stock trading commissions look expensive as a percentage of $1000, and investing $1000 in real estate sounds like a joke.

Demand how? It’s not like Apple has billions of dollars in cash sitting in the basement of their new HQ.  Bank transfers are reversible and criminals know it.  I suppose they could try kidnapping the CEO and demanding a ransom, but that’s extremely difficult to do in a developed country and would attract massive attention from all kinds of state and federal law enforcement agencies.
Someone could also grab a gun, walk into a business that keeps a lot of cash around and demand it.  It’s called bank robbery and people go to prison for it all the time.

Interestingly, it sounds like 1 GoxUSD is worth about 2 real USD.  If depositing were easy and riskless, this wouldn't last.  But the only reason to prefer GoxUSD over real USD is so you can exchange GoxUSD--&gt;GoxBTC--&gt;realBTC (or hold the GoxBTC and hope MtGox survives).  I'm guessing that fairly soon either the awful 0.43 rate for GoxBTC/real BTC will get even more awful, and/or the BTC price on Gox will increase because of people following OP's suggestions.

This strategy wouldn't work anyway.  You can't find a block and then add more transactions to it because adding transactions changes the block, which changes the hash, which means you don't have a valid block anymore.

The ban on offering a discount for cash instead of a credit card is part of the contract the credit card companies make the stores sign.  It's not a government law.

Thanks, I didn't know that.  But I had a positive experience buying coins there since it's so easy to deposit.  Probably a good idea to not keep anything there.  Deposit your fiat, get your bitcoins, and get the bitcoins into a wallet and/or an exchange that isn't insolvent.

This is exactly what people don't understand.  When the crash happens, it won't take days.  It will take a few hours.  Maybe not even that.  You won't be able to get a sell order in because MtGox will be more overloaded than anyone has ever seen it.  Forget moving your coins to btc-e or bitfloor, since the other exchanges will be overloaded, and the deposit/withdrawal mechanisms will be overloaded.  Also, there's already been several false-alarms where the market loses 10-20% then goes back to "normal".  This causes people to lose money when they panic sell, then buy back in at a higher price when the market restabilizes.  
I would recommend taking money off the table in small increments as the price increases, but also don't ever sell all your coins.  That way, you have something left over after the crash AND you get to keep making money as the price increases (avoiding the regret of "I wish I hadn't sold all my coins at $200").
Thinking you can sell your bitcoins at the first sign of trouble is like thinking you can quickly put your seat belt on at the first sign of a collision.  There just isn't time.  
**tldr** If you want to cash out, you need to do it before the crash.

This is a [birthday problem](  Basically, if sqrt(2^160) = 2^80 Bitcoin addresses are generated randomly, there's a 50% chance that there will be a collision somewhere on the Bitcoin network.  2^80 is a lot smaller than 2^160, but it's still a very large number.  If everyone in the world generated an address every second, it would take about 5 million years to get up to 2^80.  There's nothing to worry about as long as you're not using something with poor randomness properties, like brain wallets.

If you want to play around with mining and gamble a few cents worth of electricity on a potentially huge payoff, go for it.  But I'm not ready to trade away my bitcoins for dogecoins yet.
