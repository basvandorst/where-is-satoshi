Oh sorry, of course I mean addresses, I will change my post accordingly.

Okay, so people should rely on other methods of investigation and privacy is valued over security. This is good, but maybe doesn't reflect the opinion of the majority of people.
I read about bitcoin in 2010 and really liked the idea back then, but haven't really used it beyond simple mining experiments. I would really like to incorporate it into my everyday life, but it doesn't seem to be very stable and suffers from a bad reputation.
I asked the questions, because I want to have more insight into how bitcoin is used now and how I could possibly convince people to use it.
Thank you for your input!

You are right, I don't know what I intended to say here, so I just removed that statement.

Yes, that's what I meant to say. If one uses multiple addresses and never reuses an address it's possible to hide the balance, but if one would decide to maintain only one address, the balance would be revealed. Are there tools which automatically do the address generation for every transaction? This is probably user-friendly enough.
But in this case, how does law enforcement work, if it is impossible to track down transactions to a certain individual? I think this is an important point when talking about bitcoin. Right now, bitcoin is seen as a very shady currency by most people I asked. People believe only criminals use it. What could be done to improve the reputation of bitcoin?

I see, so it's very easy to use.


Yes and I hope it will stay legal.


Makes sense. Most of concerns are not justified and that bitcoin can actually work.
