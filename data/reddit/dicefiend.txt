Did you have any luck? I'm looking at accepting Bitcoin but I don't know who I should use. I hate coinbase, but if lots of people use it, it may seem more trustworthy.

Awesome news for your wife. I recently sold a coin to get a business idea started up. I've just launched and I'm setting up payments in Bitcoin. I've still got some hodled on the side, but any Bitcoin that comes through I'll hodl as well. Hope it goes well for you guys!

I use CoinJar, so I will use BPay half the time and then cash deposits via CoinJars Blueshyft. Go to the local news agency, they can the QR code hand over the cash and leave. The cash option is good because it's instant but there is a fee.

It was the typical explanation about when it was created and a few buzz words to make them sound like an authority on it.
They had 2 guys on, and they were hell bullish on Ethereum. One of them made a million on it. So you can kind of see it being pushed.
In the end it was likened to gambling and the guy doing the report saying he wouldn't invest in Bitcoin.

If you're in Australia, try CoinJar. After verifying, you can either Bpay or go to a newsagent, (via BluShyft) drop in cash and get some coin instantly.
