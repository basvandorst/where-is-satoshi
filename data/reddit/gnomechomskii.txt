I wish I still worked on the trading floor just so I could hear all those fuckwits bash bitcoin.  Only a couple of those jokers had an econ degree, and maybe only one of them was sober enough during the classes to make any sense of monetary theory.  So, all of this is good, guys.  It shakes out the weak hands, just as always.

How did you get the meeting?  I would like to do this.

Great point. Its amazing isn't it?  Give people power to be their own bank and all they want to do is find a bank for it.  I get it but at the same time I'm disappointed.

Good call.  I could do more harm than good.

The internet itself is run by private companies, no?  Could a person be cut off from an online presence entirely?

Fuck wall St fuck the sec.  We don't want them.

Exchange controls are often put in place to prevent people from using other currencies. Black markets then develop, often right around the corner from banks or even on the steps. Then there is a discrepancy between official exchange rates and the black market rate. Economists and investors often look at the  size of the discrepancy as an indication of just how bad things are. All that said it will probably never happen here. My house will probably never burn down either but I like the insurance.

Even now it's more stable than a crashing currency.  Not a likely scenario but it's happened before... so many times.

Great post, thanks for sharing. Imagine all the benefits of a decentralized, sound form of money.  But I'm not optimistic that people really care about that kind of thing until they're compelled to.  Nobody really cares, for example, that centralized money allows our country to wage perpetual war.  Or that the unlimited creation of money benefits the rich and connected at the expense of the poor.  Or that increasingly all of our transactions are monitored.  If people cared about that they wouldn't be using gmail or have a chase account.  The convenience outweighs everything else.

I think bitcoin would be an excellent alternative in the case of people losing faith in fiat - aka hyperinflation.  Typically people go to other types of currency or gold, but bitcoin could be a better choice for a lot of people in that scenario.  I have to remind myself that when I bought bitcoins I was thinking of this kind of thing, and I was thinking I hope it never happens and that the coins are a kind of insurance policy against political unrest and currency troubles - a hedge.

Thank you for the thoughtful response.  All very good points.  I wonder whether it might take a crisis of some kind to highlight the benefits of bitcoin such as another banking episode, or one of the traditional architectures suffering a major compromise where lots of people lose money.

As someone who owns a little bitcoin and checks into what's going on from time to time, seeing people call others faggots and bashing alternative but promising technologies makes me less excited about all of this. I'm seeing a lot of it in this sub.

I guess you could say I got caught up in the hype to some extent and bought into bitcoin at around the 650 level.  I know that the price is extremely volatile and this is a long term proposition, but with things like Apple Pay coming out I'm struggling to understand exactly why people would adopt bitcoin for anything other than international payments.  I mean, all the jargon and tech stuff is difficult for laypeople to get into.  My question is, why is bitcoin going to go mainstream?  Or why not?

I think some people who have a positive to highly positive net worth are already aware of bitcoin as a possible hedge.  They would tend to buy a few tens of thousands worth and then be just fine if not a bit miffed when the price stagnates or goes way down.

It's very unlikely but not impossible. Barter in that situation is only part of it, though. People want a stable medium of exchange.  Argentina is a good example of this right now.

Great. Thanks for the reply.

My rental is on VRBO.  We require our guests to provide a cc number for incidentals under our insurance deductible.  So, for example, when a kid rides his trike through a screen door, I charge the card (after discussing situation with guests of course). How would that work on your platform?

I love it as much as all of you, but don't get emotionally invested in your btc holdings guys.  A lot of people have killed themselves over less than a big BTC bust.  My gg grandfather bailed out of a window in 1929.  Remember, your worth as a human being has almost nothing to do with your net worth.

This is a little hyperbolic
