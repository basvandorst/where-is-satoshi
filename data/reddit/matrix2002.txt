I really don't like a lot of what Buffet says or does, but this is a pretty accurate quote.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:36:51
Yes, Buffet is a hustler. In the past, he has railed against Gold or other precious metals for many of the same reasons he criticizes Bitcoin, yet he still famsously bought millions of dollars of Silver and then made a shit ton of money off of it.
Don't believe a word this guy says. 
He has cultivated this mid-west, aw-shucks persona, but this guy will cut your throat in a dark alley with a dirty knife if he could make another percentage point from it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:18:27
He couldn't control what she said, so that's why he disowned her. 
Have you seen the documentary? She paints a much different picture that the one he wants to be seen.
Vacation homes, private jets, massive family holiday gatherings. Not exactly a "typical" lifestyle.'
That's why he was angry. It clashed with his carefully cultivated image. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:48:36


Because when they deviate from his image, he cuts them off. 
His billions buy a lot "yes" men and agreement.


And I am sure you know him personally, right?
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:58:20
Sorry, but you and the other people that work in compliance are there as a dog and pony show for the public.
When it comes down to it, Wells Fargo and the other banks don't have to do anything.  They run the economy and have massive political influence as a result.
Let me as you a question. 
How many people that work for Wells Fargo have gone to jail for laundering the Mexican Drug Cartel's money?
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:40:56
I agree, his opinion in the media is worthless but, he has made money a lot of different ways than buying under valued companies.
He is massive hypocrite at best and a liar at worst, because he famously said precious metals were a bad investment, then bought millions of dollars of silver and made a ton of money from it.
Buffet will rail against Bitcoin and then go and buy thousands of them when he thinks he can get a good return.
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:52:39


After he makes the trades, they become inconsequential to everyone else because his trades are so big they move the market.
He only likes investments at a specific price. Once they move too much, the returns aren't any good.
Sure, you can buy Coke-cola stock, but after he drives up the price 10%, you won't see any decent return.
You need to know his ideas BEFORE he does them.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:14:48
You can cut her off financially without being a dick about it. 
It's a simple conversation. 
He tells her he can't support her. She is upset, but doesn't really have a choice. He still allows her to visit and be a part of the family. She eventually respects his decision and they have more respect for each other.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:10:37
I am not claiming he is a massive asshole or a completely idiot.
I am saying that his public persona isn't real. He cultivates it for his own reasons.
Maybe he likes being the "good guy" in public. 
Maybe he does it to justify/hide his cutthroat business practices. 
I don't know.
I do know he is really good at two things:
1) Making money
2) Cultivating a public persona that he is a "nice guy" and it's easy to do what he does.
My main point is don't believe what he says. He has shown in the past to do the exact opposite of his statements.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:24:06


You didn't address my main point, which is that Buffet does not tell people the truth about how he makes money.
You just insulted me because you didn't understand the main point of my comment.
Buffet says one thing, like precious metals are a bad investment, then goes out and buys a bunch of Silver.
Another is when he talked his whole career about only buying "good value, well run companies", then goes out and buys municipal bonds.
He says one thing and does another.
You don't know his next trade or strategy and people trying to replicate his style of investing usually end up losing money.
Hence, my main point, Buffet is a genius investor and you shouldn't believe anything he says because he doesn't tell the truth about how he gets ideas for trades or investments.
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:53:35
It's laughable that Wells Fargo is "concerned" about laundering money.
They (and the other big banks) are the worst offenders.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:43:10


Again, you aren't listening. The public record is too late. He has already made the move. You can't make the same move as him.


Every commodity, including precious metals, trade differently (and wildly).  Acting like commodities are an easy and "predictable" trade is naive at best.


Commodities don't trade predictably. He made millions of dollars on a highly sophisticated Silver trade.
Maybe the most famous silver trade in the past 100 years. 
"Normal" people can't do what he does.  
He acts like they can. He is misleading the public on how difficult it is to do what he does.


He talks his whole career about how people should only buy safe, blue chip stocks and ETFs', then goes out and makes a major move in municipal bonds.
It's completely different. Again, he mislead the public. He preached safe, well run companies, then goes out and completely changes his market and strategy.
It's an investment 180. 


People lose money, or break even all the time on EFT's.  It's all about timing. 
You can convince yourself that stock market EFT's are "safe investment", but when you need the money most, the market might be down and you could lose all your "earnings".
Millions of people had that exact thing happen to them when they lost their job and had to pull out of their retirement accounts, selling at the exact bottom. Losing all of their "gains."


I never said he lies. He misleads. He distracts. He acts like anyone can do what he does. 


And calling someone an idiot on anonymous website is about as tough as Hello Kitty.
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:52:10
Investing in the Blue Chip stocks and ETF's are probably the most boring, typical way of investing you can do.
This is what Buffet has preached for years.
He has always said that people should just buy good companies at "good values".
Then he goes out and invests heavily in the municipal bond market at a time when many municipalities are threatening default.
He bought bonds, which have limited return (unlike equity investments or stock). And municipalities are government run organizations that don't have a "product". They just collect taxes.
Saying market matching ETF's are the same type of investments as municipal bonds is like saying ice-cream tastes like french fries.
It's the equivalent of a professional opera singer becoming a gangster rap artist.
garbledygarble doesn't realize there are people out there who don't listen to the spoon fed characterizations given us by the media about Buffet.
I judge Buffet by his actions, not his words.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:16:12
Good points. 
I just try to not buy into Buffet's well crafted public persona. Just like I don't believe everything she says, I don't believe what he says either.
It's difficult, even on , Buffet has a lot of people believing in his nice guy persona.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:32:28
Don't really listen to what Buffet says, he often does the opposite of his public statements.
He has been historically down on gold (and other precious metals) for the same reasons he slams Bitcoin, but he has bought gold a few times in his career, and famously made a killing.
Buffet is a investment genius who's public persona is this "aw shucks, anyone can do what I do." and "I am a simple businessman, I like stuff I understand."
Blah, blah blah.
He is a super sophisticated investor that understands vastly more than he lets on.
His comments on Bitcoin are essentially meaningless, he is a speculator like any other hedge fund manager. He just does it better than anyone else.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:45:26
I am shocked at this hack "journalism".
This idiot reporter has no sense of shame or morals.
She should be fired and be banned from the internet before she ruins more lives.
I hope she never "investigates" another story again.

It's a persona that shows innocence and naïvety, simple-mindedness and thinks of the world in black and white.

The cop probably didn't know what Bitcoin was until she told him, then he said his quote.
The conversation probably went something like this:














Sounds plausible.
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:58:12
So you think all investment types are the same?
"Value investing" is meaningless when applied to everything.
Everyone looks for value. Why else would you buy it?
People don't buy stuff they think is overpriced.
Which brings me back to my point. Buffet's words are meaningless or misleading, take your pick.  
He is essentially saying "buy stuff you think is cheaper than it should be."
Well, duh. 
Typical people, which he preaches to, should not be trying to do what he does. He is a part of the massive financial industry that misinforms, miseducates and siphons money from non-finance people.
People like his persona, so they don't see him for what he really is.
He has profited from horribly corrupt companies, yet he acts like "anyone can be rich."
And "I am just an honest midwest business man."
It's bullshit. He made a lot of his money from insurance. Insurance companies are some of the most corrupt corporations in the whole world.
This is the hypocrisy that he represents.
People think he is a good guy because he occasionally calls for higher taxes and doesn't talk like a "typical rich guy."

His son might have explained it poorly to him, or incompletely.
If you watch the video, he really seems to only have passing knowledge of Bitcoin. 
And he says "I never communicated with Bitcoins."


You are right, it doesn't make sense because he doesn't know what he is talking about. He is just confused as what is exactly going on.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:22:42
So, have you used his concepts to invest?
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:17:36
Someone could contact the model train store he frequents, then ask the owner what he would want, buy it for him and then give the owner a small fee to make sure Dorian gets it.
This way, he isn't creeped out by stuff being sent to his house and it seemed like the Train Store people actually liked him and respected him, so they might be trusted to get him the gifts.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:55:52
Ha! You think he tells the public how he really trades and values companies? 
He fools people into thinking he is unsophisticated, then they try to "invest like Buffet" and get killed because he sees 5 steps ahead of everyone else. 
He would rather give up his own granddaughter than let the public know where his next idea is coming from.

You haven't  been respectful. 
You have been dismissive and condescending.


Again, I haven't made up my mind on Buffet, you have.
You decided a long time ago to buy into his well crafted media-made image.
I remain open to the possibility that he isn't exactly all he claims. Why? Because he has publicly said one thing and then done the other.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:13:05
I should have specified, many successful reporters are sociopaths and don't respect people.

She is in WAY over her head. She has no idea what is going on.
I could see Dorian as sort of leading her on without her or him realizing it.
The real Satoshi would never have admitted it or even used his own real name.
It's laughable. She was under a lot of pressure to publish this story of a guy with a name that fit and a background that sort of fit and he seemed to flirt with the idea of having been involved.
She played herself and lost.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:51:49
I am telling you, he is fooling you. Buffet is a genius and trying to replicate his results by listening to his advice is a fools game. 
He intentionally misleads the public on what he does and how he makes money. 
He knows a lot more than he lets on. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:34:49
I think he gets really frustrated because people don't attack his arguments with anything substantial, they are just shallow arguments meant as marketing plows rather than actual debate or discourse.
Granted, he does get really angry.
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:41:04


 
That doesn't make any sense.


Did you use his advice and buy stock in 2009? What stock did you buy? EFT's? 
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:46:16


Ha. He has you fooled too. He also invested in (and handsomly profited from) municipal bonds. Are those "value companies"?
No, they were just a way for him to make money. He doesn't give a shit where he makes money: metals, companies, municipalities, or insurance. 
I don't deny the man is talented, but I dislike his hypocrisy. He is a billionaire financier who flies on private jets, has vacation homes, disowns family members who disobey him and doesn't care where he makes money.
People like him because they think: "If this nice guy can become a billionaire, so can I!"
It's a fraud. He is a genius investor, extremely talented at making money in any way possible. 
He is also excellent at controlling his public image, with this one documentary (and accompanying article) that opposes his carefully crafted image.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:02:18


How you do know if he is intensely private?
If he is so private, how do we know what he does and where he lives on a daily basis?
This is a part of his media-persona which he cultivates very intentionally.
He wants to be shown as the "simple mid-west get lucky businessman", but he is anything but that.
He is an extremely shrewd businessman who is very talented at manipulating the media.
I don't think the article is any good, but look at what he did when someone defies him, he completely shut her out of his life.  His own granddaughter. 
What do you think he does to business rivals? 
@_date: 2015-08-01 02:13:00
If he is still in Japan, he is fucked. The Japanese don't play around with arrests. He is basically guilty if they are able to arrest him. Their conviction rate is over 95%. 
And he will get A LONG time in prison. They are not easy on people like him. 
I can't believe he would still be in Japan, though. How stupid could you be? Unless his visa was revoked and he hasn't been able to leave the country?

This is par for the course for banks. They hate bitcoin because it is competition for them. 
Declaring "We are worried about money laundering" is mainly a marketing strategy to make them seem like they are tough on money laundering when in reality, they don't give a shit about it.
Banks will try to use this idiotic "criticism" of cryptocurrencies as a way to maintain their control over the money system.
