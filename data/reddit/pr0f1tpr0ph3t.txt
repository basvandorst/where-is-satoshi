Very nice UI. Beautiful as well. But I stick with my Trezor One...

1 Satoshi = $0.01, but prolly not in my lifetime... lol

Quit while you’re ahead. Or only play with 10% of your bankroll. I don’t day trade, but I’ve gambled on sports for 20+ years. Good luck!

Bitcoin ain’t dead,
Banks are just scared...

I was like “Oh Hell no!” When he said his Trezor got hacked. Luckily he was scammed. I didn’t know where to store my BTC if they were getting hacked all of a sudden. Maybe on my Ledger collecting dust lol.

If you have 0.5, place a 0.005 bet. Gambling isn’t the problem. Addiction/greed/lack of money management is...

That was my point. Custodial is a sham. You dunno WTF they are doing. “Not your keys, not your crypto!”
@_date: 2019-10-29 21:13:57
I see where you're coming from. I do 1% of my BankRoll for ShitsAndGiggles. Its just a hobby to me...
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:59:41
Just remember “Not your keys, not your crypto!”
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:47:41
WOW. I never thought of that. Much respect, Bo$$! All I wanted to do with my post was have a few people load up their hardware wallets. I appreciate the info, Chief!
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:58:49
Naw. I was pretty much saying “Not your keys, not your crypto”...
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:01:55
If Coinbase shows a balance, then cool. Otherwise, “Not your keys, not your crypto!” ��������
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:33:18
Cool. I will withdraw. 99% of my BTC on a Trezor. Thanks, Bo$$!

In at $250/coin 2015. I have enough BTC. My goal is 1BTC BURNED: 1xPPxProfitProphetSyndicatev6F9Ce  (for the culture) by the Halvening 23MAY20. Wish me luck!!!
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:34:43
Send some to a burn address like: 1xPPxProfitProphetSyndicatev6F9Ce to make all of us $0.01 richer! lol

A few thousand are lost forever through ProofOfBurn:

Why? It just looks to me like someone bought 0.001 at $11 and ran it up to $16.50...
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:28:00
Nothing. It’s a wallet with keys, unlike CashApp...
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:47:47
Gotcha. The same thing as if someone thought it was okay to tell everyone they had $11 worth of BTC in 2009. You never know how much it will be worth in the future.

Put 12 into the BlockFi 6.2% BTC Interest Account and spend the 0.062BTC if interest every month instead of touching the 12BTC...

France/Andreescu won! I will LIVEBET and hedge out of Medvedev. The pregame line is -6XX. Too much. I will wait for Medvedev to brake him. Thanks!
