CubeSats use solar cells to convert solar light to electricity that is then stored in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that provide power during eclipse as well as during peak load times. Etc.
Altitude can be altered to get better solar energy outputs.
Solar sails, electric propulsion, chemical propulsion, the whole 9 yards. It can all be installed to offer energy to the system.
You're taking what I said out of context there.
Mining Bitcoin with solar power whilst in the atmosphere is a feat. And moon rocks have been prospected and sold as valuables. Never used for profit purposes. (Aka prospection as the guy above said.)
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:08:07
You basically nailed it. I meant lower orbit and right above said atmosphere. My slip up.
Regarding the context, you took my whole "using the atmosphere" out of the context of using it to get more direct solar power. Which is what SatCube does.
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:59:29
You're talking about valuables, moon rocks are reletively rare, and otherwise serve no function.
Bitcoin mining uses the atmosphere to generate energy and thus direct revenue, not just Solar power for self-operation.

Just looking for opinions more than anything else. In almost entirely sure I'll be buying some, but just wanted to hear everyone's view on the subject.
But my main question is, other than the limited supply of Bitcoin, what is cashing it's price to fluctuate?
And what has your experience been with it so far?
@_date: 2016-06-11 10:44:30
give me your opinion, so I can decide wether or not I believe him.
That's the point of the post.
I need a resource of what it is, I will do the convincing myself.
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:04:58
Thanks for the reply.
I am in the same boat, and I think that adopting Bitcoin as a species starts with us.
People always adopt the newest evolution because it is superior. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 07:08:28
Explain what you mean.
@_date: 2016-06-11 10:39:23
I don't really believe in the whole micro managing of the stock market and all, and I prefer longtime investments.
But I see Bitcoin as more of an actually currency than an "investment."
And as far as the halving goes, *i don't even know what that means* so in case it is important, I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is.
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:26:21
So you have no tips or anything ehh?
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:34:06
I had heard of it before, but alternate currencies have been around. But I had to actually look into it to see how it was decentralized, limited supply and whatnot.
I'm trying to read up on it as much as I can for now, but I do want to buy Bitcoin sometime before the halving in a month.
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:01:45
How I yearn for the day! XD
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:02:25
Exactly why I am so keen on buying some.
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:09:15
This is the EXACT kind of reply I was looking for, thanks for the comment!
I'll probably buy soon, as I am really a believer in human adoption regarding the most superior systems.
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:02:24
Oh, so Satoshi personally invites me in? I thought he "didn't have time to convince [me]."

Not always true to be honest.
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:07:00
It looks to be the future of currency, as humanity always adapts to the most effective method. Money is money, but this is the next evolution. (And the Dollar is collapsing too)
Thanks for the quotes.
@_date: 2016-06-11 12:50:51
I said in come other comments that I am already convinced.
3 days in and I am positive I'll buy some. (Can only lose what you put in, and nothing ventured, nothing gained)
But I am just looking for opinions, like, what's your story, how has it been for you so far? I hear it's a bit of a Wild West.
I believe in long term investment, and I will probably use it for regular purchases as well. If anything else, it's just fun to hobby with, and I only have so many years here.
Just looking for everyone's stance on the subject.
@_date: 2016-06-11 12:57:15
So you're saying I should get a time machine? :P
So I am thinking maybe the best time might be a few days AFTER the halvening
You think now is a better time? Why?
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:30:09
Came a few days too late ehh?
I wish I had just looked at it when I first heard of it.. Lol
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:29:01
What other factors are affecting the value of Bitcoin other than the introduction of the value supply?
That's actually one thing I can't seem to put in my search bar to find effectively.
@_date: 2016-06-11 07:18:45
This is my main thing, I think it's kinda like investing in the stock market. You can either micro Manage it to hell, or leave it in for a while and let it slowly come back bigger over several years. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:24:22
Thanks! I believe in long term investment, and "cryptocurrency" looks like the next evolution of money. So I am already pretty sure ill buy.
But I ask, what's your experience been? I am reading up a lot, (I heard of it before, but just got into it recently) and I am just looking for opinions. For people who are against it, why? So I can make wise choices going forward.
Your *story,* so to speak?

"I killed the bank" - Andrew Jackson
Yeah I am not a big fan of the bank, or fiat systems in general. Printing money over and over just takes money from my pocket. And everyone likes the pros of the Gold standard.
Basically I am young, and I feel like investing into Bitcoin is like investing in the Internet in 1980. It's the future and humanity always adopts new technology, but only if they like it.
And people like money.
@_date: 2016-06-11 10:41:18
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:01:17
I have really.
Quite a bit in fact. And I am always interested in economics, I am asking for people's personal experiences.
I can read about how it works and why all day. But a mentor is the best teacher, and the best experience comes first hand.
Before I get said experience myself, I want to hear what others have to say.
So really, sell it to me or advise against it regarding YOUR experience. I'm making the decision myself, not asking you to make it for me. 
TL;DR 2nd mouse gets the cheese. So tell me what your experience has been.
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:13:30
I guess what I should say is.
I have, and I won't stop any time soon as I am pretty infatuated with it. Like the Internet, it's the next evolution of money. Money has evolved before (Gold standard to fiat) and is going to do it again. And now I am just a doing more looking.
I am basically positive I will buy some. (convert it whatever)
But what I want to hear, is what your STORY is; a mentor is the best teacher and the best experience comes from those before you. 
Second mouse gets the cheese. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:30:51
Thanks I am kinda new to the whole thing and I have been reading up on it as much as I can.
The only profitable Bitcoin mining I can see is with a solar panel and a really nice graphics card/bitcoin-mining dedicated machine. You used to be able to make a profit with your PC. But now you really have to dedicate to it to make any real profit, (much like mining gold or anything else, hence the name) and if you fall behind the others in the efficiency arms race, you'll just end up with negative net profits.
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:06:57
That kinda why I ask this question.
Here I am infatuated with cryptocurrencies and what benefits over fiat they have, while retaining the pros of the Gold standard.
I am looking for people's stories, what is everyone ELSE's opinion, so I can learn even more about the subject.
If you have a story, please share!
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:05:02
This article I found on the sub yesterday. He says the halving is soon, but others suggest to buy afterward.
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:19:32
What are the arguments for either option?
@_date: 2016-06-11 12:47:02
So does the stock market.
Either way, you can only lose what you put in.
@_date: 2016-06-11 08:32:05
@_date: 2016-06-11 11:18:10
Pretty much nothing.
(I had technically HEARD of Bitcoin before, but didn't look at it being decentralized and didn't know about the blockchain nor the trusted third party BEING all of these miners.)
So I actually looked at it like 3 days ago, and I am nearly positive I will buy. 
I'm just looking for more information and opinions. If you don't want to that's coo'.
@_date: 2016-06-11 10:48:41
I read up on that.
But what does it mean for the market?
Are they going to increase in value like gold? Or does the halving cause the currency to stagnate in value, this buying now may be good as well, because it will be a consistent value instead of keeping my wealth in the fiat system.
Where they print more every day and it become less valuable the longer it sits in my bank account?
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:13:10
I have heard the term bullish, I could urban dictionary it, but care to explain its meaning regarding Bitcoin?
I also hear Bitcoin is introducing smarter smart transaction systems than ETH.
@_date: 2016-06-11 12:45:47
What goods do you find yourself buying with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-09 22:23:53
You kinda answered your own question.
The value of currency is a concept, one that is regulated (decentralized regulation for Bitcoin) and thus recognized. 
If people can trust a dollar, to use Bitcoin they have to trust the system it uses and the programs for them.
You could get a thumb drive, and sell the bits physically to someone as well. 
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:10:39
Probably because the Reserve can't print more Bitcoin and basically steal your wealth.
It feels like gold.
@_date: 2016-06-11 12:41:31

(And thank you so much for the full reply :D)
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:28:06
I never said that governments should. In fact I hope that the US never does.
I just said they can, and Bitcoin was never intended to protect then users from their governments, rather to protect itself from the governments.
The Bitcoin teams can do whatever they want. They are not supposed to be slaves of the people. 
Bitcoin is a choice. If you don't like it, don't be a part of it.
Most important. Anonymity and giving someone your BANK DETAILS + personal information are kind of different concepts.

Cryptocurrency is a common interest. 
Technology like the blockchain and Bitcoin software supports it.
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:19:15
You are misunderstanding the language here.
The point is not that the Banks have failed to control Bitcoin, "allowing it" to grow unaffected by the banks, but that Bitcoin is unstoppable in nature.
But they have "failed" to control it because everything else about the government has been under tight control. And this might be their downfall. 
Their last line of defense here is to convince people it isn't real.
@_date: 2016-07-17 18:14:40
What do you mean? Is it not true?
@_date: 2016-07-28 04:05:48
Make your own anonymous Bitcoin then, dumbass.
Bitcoin indeed never was anonymous, it was just about individual control, and decentralization. It's about being the only one who can control your account.
If you protect your password with you life, that Bitcoin can never be claimed be anyone ever. But actually creating the account can be regulated by any government you are a part of. And if they punish withholding information, you are not exempt from your government's punishments.

You don't have to track the whole face, facial recognition has worked for a while because it does.
And you can always still have other verifications, but that would be the most convenient and secure.
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:07:14
I get that. But that's the point, they have let it happen, be it their own failure or inevitability. They still wish it didn't.
I am not confused, on the topic, I don't understand this guys reaction.
