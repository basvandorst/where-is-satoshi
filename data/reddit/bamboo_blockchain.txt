The conversation really needs to shift from the speculative value of bitcoin towards use-case (in the mainstream public). 
I say this because it does seem like a ludicrous price for first time entrants to Bitcoin. People are thinking of Bitcoin as Microsoft - its been around for sometime and is probably useful but its too complicated to get into and the 'time for investing' is perceived to have long past.
All in all its easier for people to believe it will fail because they want it to fail. Its preferable to be proven correct in society then to understand how awesome it is being wrong.

Anyone reckon Coinbase moving to segwit transactions will have any short term effects?

It literally would just be so awesome to be a super sayan, I'd even take a Krillin.

I would be interested to see the last non-segwit coinbase transaction fee and the first segwit transaction fee for comparison purposes.

Didn't India recall their two most valuable dollar notes from circulation whilst the banks were closed and essentially bankrupted their people who would trade largely through means of cash?
