Sooooo. 
I was looking into this and came across bitpay. I bought the card and forgot about it while i was waiting for it in the mail. 
I came across some money hardships and only have crypto. But i needed desperately to pay for my school tuition. On the last day as i basically gave up hope this debt card shows up in the Damn mail. Lightbulb!!!!!!
I transferred the needed btc to the bitpay wallet. Which is a bit expensive in fees. But beggars can't be choosers. And prayed as i submitted my payment. Second later i get a confirmation email that my tuition is paid. 
Thank you bitpay and thank you satoshi. 
That's my experience. I haven't found another use for the card But it is In my wallet to show off to people. My opinion get one and just hold onto it you never know when you might be in a bind and need it.

Use blockchainexplor too search your public key. That will show you how much you have. Send more btc to that wallet using the public key. Keep the private key very safe don't let anyone see it and don't lose it. When you want to move it download mycelium app. Use the private key to open the wallet. YouTube has all this information in very good tutorials.

How do you think the person got the crypto currency in the first place. Either they purchased it on an exchange or they mined it. Add i don't know to many people that are mining enough volume to be selling of coins in bulk. So although ideally not needing an exchange would be great we need to be realistic. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:08:15
Sounds like a huge pump and dumb to me
@_date: 2019-08-12 05:40:52

I'm going to give you valuable information that i found by doing research. So going forward do your own research. Open up coinbasepro account. Move btc from coinbase to coinbasepro. Use coinbasepro to send btc to paper wallet (this method doesn't have fees). Btc paper wallet can be achieved by googling btc paper wallet and following the coindesk tutorial. Happy hodling.
