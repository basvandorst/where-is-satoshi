Every possible decision any person can make is in some way premised on the exploitation of another person, that's just a fact of life. At least according to the definition of exploitation for modern liberal states, which is, put concisely: a multilateral transfer of unequally valued items such that the possessors of all items would voluntarily make the transfer if the items to be transferred were of equal value. This entails at least that the overwhelming majority of acts, and all real acts in Western states, involve exploiting others. I assume you believe that if acts exploit people, then they are not victimless. Therefore my previous point, that there is no such thing as a victimless act.
Edit: should clarify "liberal" meaning "liberal perfectionist or political liberal" - since there is argument as to which Western states (attempt to) adhere to. I described the theory of exploitation for modern and classical liberals, and libertarians.

Fines are definitively justice. Also, a fine cannot be a bribe by definition, though I see what you're getting at.


Yup. Though worth noting there is no such thing as a victim-less act. We tolerate minimally harmful acts.

Well, they didn't get off exactly - in the Iran Contra scandal they got caught lying to Congress plus a few other things, and in the relevant countries HSBC's laundering led to fines/settlements but no criminal charges (yet, anyway).
There's definitely a moral issue for corporate law and public accountancy of the agencies there, but on the legal side of it things are mostly watertight.
Anyhow it seems weird to defend Ross' activities due to his being a creation of the War on Drugs. Criminalising things creates criminals, that's kind of the point.
