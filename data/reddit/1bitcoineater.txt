Thank you!

I guess they save money that way instead of fighting a losing battle

For those interested, I found an old reddit thread here: 
I uninstalled the firmware and app, and installed again. The balance is correct now. Still annoying but fixed. Will be paranoid if the balance is correct everytime I load up the app.

“I love seeing new services constantly starting to accept Bitcoin. Bitcoin is really becoming “the currency of the Internet.” I’m most concerned by possible government reactions to Bitcoin. They can’t destroy Bitcoin, but they could really slow things down by making exchange much more difficult.”

Nice timing with Bitfinex withdrawals

Thank you for a response.

I have traveled to over 80 countries in the past 10 years fwiw. I am ready to settle down in Australia. 
So if I sell in Singapore/Hong Kong, put it in the bank there, transfer the money back to Aus bank after 2-3 years, no tax?

At this point he needs to see segwit works and is not risky. If it works out well on litecoin in terms of price and stability in the code, he will activate it on Bitcoin. Patient man. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 11:11:33
Bitcoin was valued much less back then
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:14:45
I'm not saying you are wrong, but you made an assumption and then a conclusion, doesn't quite work. You assumed they would (which is probably true), and then concluded they are hypocritical. 
It's like me saying if you could steal money without being caught, you would, therefore you are a guilty. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:03:08
The coins have moved so many times I do not have record on the blockchain. Thanks for the link though. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:31:12
Yeah I've checked this out, still confusing what to do as I have no records at all.
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:02:18
I want to buy a house. There's only so much cash I can keep at home before I don't know what to do with it. Say I have 1million in cash and then? I can never purchase a property with cash.

Who needs a wife more than Bitcoiners? :D
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:23:34
I've been following Bitfinex very closely ever since the hack. I don't see any reason to suspect there was solvency issues, especially after they completed their bfx tokens redemptions. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:09:46
Each time you receive funds, however small, breadwallet creates a new one.

You may think Litecoin is useless. But you need to look up the definition of scam.
a dishonest scheme; a fraud.
Litecoin is neither these. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:11:54
Firstly, some people already have moved onto alt coins. While most are in for a trade and return to Bitcoin after, there is a percentage of people who don't come back. 
Bitcoin is still King, much like how USD has been king for a while. Even when problems exist, people end up returning to USD or Bitcoin. 
There are no coins that are popular and similar to Bitcoin in terms of fixed inflation. Litecoin comes close but it has the same problem as Bitcoin. Segwit can not activate due to chinese miners. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:40:55
I too would like to know this. I believe its as safe as using a 12 word seed but I can't confirm.
@_date: 2017-04-19 05:15:11
Imo, there was never any solvency issues. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:30:46
I want to pay tax, just confusing how it all works. There are no bank records. So I can just say "I bought in 2012, the price was XXX" and be done with it?
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:31:15
Sure it does. We are talking about it precisely due to the large price. If it was sold for fair or low price, we wouldn't care.
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:53:30
This is big if true
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:05:42
It's a tricky situation. On one hand you dont want your wife to readily have access to it (I assume). Ignoring the wife issue, it's best to write half in part 1 of a bible and the other half in a different book that no one will check anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:31:49
This was back in 2012 when it was very different and difficult to buy Bitcoins. It was done via cash. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:45:20
That's not how it works. It could hit 75% but and still not activate. It needs to be over 75% for a entire block cycle. 
Edit: What said is correct
@_date: 2017-04-19 03:13:22
Problem is solved :) See the other comment.
@_date: 2017-04-09 11:27:46
I am content with paying tax if it means I can use the money to purchase a property or two. 
All my traveling has been tourist

They claim to be anonymous but they never addressed whether they give any or all of the following information to the government: IP address, email address when used, Bitcoin address, how much and who I give fiat to and/or bills. 
Until then, I recommend avoiding them.  
Furthermore, the spread sucks.
Edit: Thanks for the downvote. If I am wrong, I am happy to be corrected. The fact they have read this and not responded says something.

Nothing happened over at Mt Gox, nothing will happen here.

What if my friend has close to 7 figures and wants to buy a house and other things with the money? 
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:01:39
If segwit activates on Litecoin, there is a much higher chance for it to activate on Bitcoin. Please vote to remain signalling.

I don't want cash
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:01:30
At some point you have to weigh the risk of an unlikely event vs losing the backup
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:30:25
Bitcoins seems to be Gold, heavy, expensive, but a good store of value.
With Segwit and Lightning, I see Litecoin being cheaper and faster, better for everyday use/cash. Both will be useful, different purpose.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:35:32
He knows if he came back he could influence the decision. For that reason, he probably won't. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:17:06
Sadly, no. Localbitcoin is the best bet
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:00:56
Sorry I was too subtle
Should've added /s

The other sub is going to love this.
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:50:06
You can't. But they pride themselves being "anonymous" when they aren't really. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 13:28:25
Ironic considering they won't signal segwit even on Litecoin where blocksize doesn't matter.

Then that means the original coins would've moved, but they haven't.

Digixdao was earlier?

Pretty much, he's worded it so he wins no matter what.

I posted my reasons a month ago here for buying Litecoin, listing it's advantages. Might help:
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:10:03
Tiny bit of caution if you are using Breadwallet on IOS. 
The 4 digit passcode can be "broken" if you have a backup on icloud/computer and they know your apple password.
Broken by repeated tries and restoring backup.

I like this title. It did sound like rambling. 
Strange he's not open minded, I still think it's due to stubbornness and conflict of interest to his Gold business.
