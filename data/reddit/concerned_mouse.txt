That's surprising.   I managed a full sync on a pi3b+ in about 9 days, this was a couple of years ago though.
I got that result with the pi4, 100mbit down and using a ssd.  Port forwarding allows for more connections, perhaps that's what made the difference.   I also have a good heatsink with fan attached so there was no CPU throttling.

You can't really post the full document, not in one transaction anyway.  You can currently add 80 bytes of data to a transaction via OP_RETURN.  You can create a hash of your document and include that to your transaction via the method I described.
Technically,  you can break your document down into 80 byte chunks and attach it to several transactions but that would be expensive depending on the amount of data you'd like to attach in total.
You can easily add OP_RETURN data to transactions via the Trezor web wallet, there are probably a few others.   Surprisingly,  I don't think the functionality is present natively within Electrum.
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:13:32
I can personally recommend Raspiblitz (which is based on Raspibolt.)  I'd definitely go for a raspberry pi 4 though.  You can sync from scratch within 3 days or so as long as you've got a decent connection and there are automated scripts on the project github to add your own electrum server, btcpay server, watchtower &amp; more as well as the ability to easily run everything behind tor.

@_date: 2019-10-04 07:56:56


Right.  Quite rarely and usually at the weekend.  I think we've struck a nice enough balance between the current block size (weight) limit and demand.


For the most part it is.  It's nice to be able to get 1 sat/byte transactions through if you're willing to wait.  This way the protocol caters to lower income individuals too.


Are you suggesting a dynamic blocksize?  There really isn't a way to have them always full unless you just make them 100Kb or so since demand fluctuates throughout the week and macro market cycle overall.  For the sake of filling blocks up at the weekend you're suggesting we cripple the network for most of the week...?

You should always have a static channel backup to cover you in this circumstance.  This exists for lnd, not sure about the other implementations.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:41:42
But if your node has crashed, you wouldn't have a pending tx involved in a route.  No funds actually move until a route has been found, which wouldn't be the case if your node is offline.  Your SCB is only updated when a new channel is opened or closed anyhow, precise channel states are not relevant.  The downside is that all channels are closed when you restore from a SCB so you would lose some funds in tx fees.  I haven't looked into them in great detail, although I should but it seems restoration from a SCB just closing your channels in a way that signals that you're definitely not attempting to cheat.

We said nothing about a digital company specifically.  I'm discussing all types of company.


Almost 100%, unless you have any examples.  Not just most.


No it isn't.  Not until people are paid in crypto, transact with it and the recipients do the same.


I disagree.   It's just a load of extra hassle for almost no benefit at this point in the game since no cryoto provides a better experience than traditional payment methods and they are accepted in very few places, which just sell for fiat anyway.


I agree. There will likely be a few die hard holders though.


Says who?  That may be what you want..
For me, Bitcoin may possibility be widely used as a MoE after its volatility decreases to an acacceptable level for trade.  That may be 20 years from now.  Maybe 50.

@_date: 2019-10-03 07:11:45


What a ridiculous comment.  Anytime 1 sat/byte will not get you into the next block and you see transactions willing to pay higher than 1sat/byte waiting in the mempool, you are seeing the fee market in action.
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:17:03
No.  It has been a while since I looked at the proposed roadmap for the various implementations.
@_date: 2019-10-25 10:53:11
But not yours.  Also, almost 100% of the places you can currently spend Bitcoin or altcoins just allows you to sell them at the POS via a middleman/service.  So the crypto isn't their income, fiat cash is.

The only one that comes to mind for me is SatosihoLabs and even then I'm don't think they operate on crypto alone.  And I'm not even sure about that example.
Are you aware of any?


How?  If their bch has dropped by 80%..  They will be pricing their goods in fiat and will owe on that amount.  **That's why they sell it at the POS like I already said.**


You still have overheads, staff wages and a whole plethora of other business related expenses to pay.  You get to write off some losses not avaoid tax and other costs altogether. 


I already said, the examples be see today aren't adoption, they're just selling crypto at the POS.


No it doesn't.


So how has the value of Bitcoin increased by millions of percent on an exponential curve despite seeing almost no adoption in the manner that you're describing (fiat cash)?  Also, if Bitcoin was supposed to replace fiat cash, why do you think the system was modelled on gold?

This isn't my experience.   I pay 1sat/byte to open LN channels quite regularly and have to wait anywhere from a few hours up to 2 days during the week.  They go through quicker at the weekend.


Says who though?  Do you think this is a popular opinion?


They appear to be already sufficiently incentivised to me.  Do you disagree? If so, why?


So what do you estimate the fee to get into the next block, at the current level of demand in the week would be, roughly?


They never stopped though.  I don't see an issue.


The network hasn't been crippled to date though.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:57:00
I watch a different fee estimation website regularly and hardly ever see 1 sat/byte recommended as being able to get into the next block.  I don't think they are ever 'empty', in fact, I don't think were able to really define a limit given the various types of transactions aand address formats that comprise a block today.


Is there any real consensus on what constitutes a 'full block'?  I just watched your linked website and have seen a block produced at 1.37MB with more waiting within the mempool.  Going from memory,  aren't we supposed to be able to achieve ~2MB blocks regularly with a theoretical maximum of 4MB depending on how that transactions are formed?  That's with optimal segwit adoption.   Doesn't that factor into your assumptions here?


Again, says who?  Is this just your opinion?   And I have recently waited days for a 1 sat/byte transaction to clear.


Again, define regularly.   My experience varies from a few hours to days.


Where are you getting these figures from?  Miners already appear to be sufficiently reimbursed/in profit.


So I somewhat agree here (except for the larger blockspace) and the keyword is 'might'.  I'd say things are running well at the moment and we should adapt to the future in due course.  You seem to be panicking over events that will play out until after we're both dead.


Everybody in the space should know this.  We don't all panic about it though.


Its current incentive system is still playing out and you're overreacting in my opinion.   TX count is trending upwards over the long term = more fees.  Bitcoin price is trending upwards over the long-term = sufficient block reward (in fiat), even as the Bitcoin amount reduces.  And all of the most exciting upcoming upgrades revolve around either privacy or cramming more transactions into the same block space to increase efficiency = more TX = more miner revenue.
We got this.

See [here]( if you're running Windows.
If you're running Linux, in the terminal;
Start electrum with the Tor Browser open (proxy on port 9150):
    electrum --oneserver --server Tor_address.onion:50001:t --proxy socks5:127.0.0.1:9150
With Tor installed and running (proxy on port 9050):
    electrum --oneserver --server Tor_address.onion:50001:t --proxy socks5:127.0.0.1:9050
You'll need to search for an Electrum server TOR address and input that into the command in place of Tor_address.onion obviously unless you're running your own.
@_date: 2019-09-23 11:13:30
For on chain transactions and as far as the UX goes, you don't see your recipient's IP although I recall some IP information is visible from chain analysis (the broadcast node IP)
With the Lightning Network you can view the IP of the peers with which you're connected and any other node within the LN actually.  Some nodes are hidden behind a tor address though.
You must have been in extremely early to have witnessed pay-to-ip.
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:09:38
Plausible if Zap will accept the .onion address.  You'd have to export your macaroon and tls cert to your device..  Might be worth a try.  Actually that's basically how I use Bitcoin Lightning Wallet over TOR - with the Orbot VPN function.

Nothing.  Simply clone your 1tb drive to a larger one and expand the cloned partition into the newly available space.
@_date: 2019-09-13 08:51:50
I have done this but with Zap on android.  You'll only be able to connect to Zap on your own LAN unless you also set up dynDNS which probably defeats the point of running behind TOR.
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:03:45
I guess ill just explain my setup, maybe it will give you some ideas.
So I'm running a full Bitcoin &amp; Lighting Network node, routed over TOR including Electrs (Electrum Server.)
With it I can connect Electrum to it, validate/broadcast my own transactions over TOR, connect [BLW]( and do the same + LN transactions over TOR and use my own full node with Wasabi wallet to validate + broadcast over TOR.

[Raspiblitz]( is a cool project and you can donate via the LN [here](
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:15:34
My network knowledge is basic also.  As far as I know, something like nmap (and other tools) allow you to scan a dynDNS to discover what IP it points to.  If you set that up, I think your IP is shared throughout the LN via the gossip protocol and it would then show up on services like 1ML.  I've seen nodes that have a TOR and ipv4 address listed on there.
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:20:15
The protocol automatically adjusts the network difficulty according to the current hash rate at set intervals so that a block should be found approximately every 10 minutes.  Every now and then a block won't be found for a couple of hours, then 3 might be found a minute apart.  That's nothing to worry about, just the natural variance inherent within the system.
@_date: 2019-09-13 13:06:32


I'm not certain but I'd guess that most don't run behind TOR.  Maybe 1ML has stats for it..


No more than the obvious privacy conern that you've outlined.  If Bitcoin or running a node is banned where you live, broadcasting your node connection to your ISP and the world would be a bad idea.


I'm not sure about that one, it's a bit out of my league I'm afraid.  You'd have to ask in the support forum for the particular project/software that you're going to use.


Yeah that sounds like a nightmare to set up!!
