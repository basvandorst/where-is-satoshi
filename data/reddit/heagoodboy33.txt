Honestly this doesn't mean anything. There could be a trigger to activate data collection at a later date, and randomly thereafter.
Open source would be better but even then the binary uploaded to play and the source could be different.
Really the best thing is to not trust your app with the keys able to do anything malicious, but that might be more of an exchange problem.

You should have buy AND sell limits
My limit was 100% ROI from 8k buy in. Got my 100%, now either gonna rebuy in the dip or be sad if it doesn't
Trying to panic sell in a dip isn't great

Well, it's more like, why focus on this specific thing and shoehorn ideology into it?
You mentioned the record keeping capabilities of Bitcoin, but you know when there is adoption to the point things can be paid for, you can fairly easily make things anonymous when you don't have to convert anything to native currency.
If it's just about keeping a large amount of money public, say a billionare hides wealth in Bitcoin, they can still hold it fairly anonymously. It isn't as if offshore accounts are there for daily spending, it's to skirt taxes while storing value... Which until you make your Bitcoin do *something*, it's extremely good at.
I just don't see the utility in it being used for "socialist" purposes. Everything you'd want to stop people from doing with the dollar can be done with bitcoin.

You seriously underestimate the amount of money I would be prepared to waste
