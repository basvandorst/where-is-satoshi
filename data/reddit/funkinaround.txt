The only thing forced liquidation implies is that a position is claimed/settled/closed by force of Bitfinex. It may commonly be the case that this is due to insufficient maintenance margin, but this is clearly another kind of forced liquidation and there is nothing in the announcement that states that this isn't covered.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge on the subject. Do you have any knowledge of scenarios where assets are lent (say, stock loan/borrow) and the borrower loses their collateral? Their plans of issuing a haircut to USD financing providers is very concerning given their statements that these arrangements were effectively insured. There is more information regarding this [here](

You return to the lender the equivalent assets from "the firm's reserves" as Bitfinex stated when swaps effectively became insured.

Are you implying that this is not a forced liquidation? You have frozen account access so you can settle/claim/close positions. I don't think you can call this anything but a forced liquidation. Also, there is no explicit mention of what happens in the event of a hack, so there seems to be no justification to state that this "insurance" doesn't apply here.

please stop suggesting that the margin funding position will be affected as a result of this hack. The margin funding insurance was not removed in March 2014. [The announcement]( stated that, "we have decided to effectively insure all swaps on the platform". Whether or not a specific pool of money was allocated for this "insurance" is irrelevant as Bitfinex has plainly stated that all "swaps" (currently referred to as margin funds) are "insured". There can be no difference between lent USD and inactive USD, unless you are welcoming Bitfinex to a lawsuit.

I agree that this is what it should mean. has [also stated]( that the, "margin funding ... lender will be affected". To me, because of this "insurance", there should be no difference between someone providing margin funds with "insurance" and someone that just held USD/ETH/ETC/LTC in their wallet. Zane seems to be implying that a certain class of account holders are affected when it should really be stated that everyone is affected regardless of what they held on Bitfinex or how they held it.

Your assumption does not involve the "insurance" that BFX stated they will provide for margin funders due to forced liquidation. If BFX defaults on paying anything to a margin funder, the margin funder should have a claim to the assets of BFX.

You are missing a crucial feature of credit cards which is the ability to dispute transactions. When you pay with a debit card, cash, or digital tokens, that money is transferred and you may have no recourse if, say, you prepaid for some activity but either you or the operator had to cancel. Would you rather have to fight the operator about their refund policy or just call your credit card company to cancel the charge? 
Having a credit card that is 0% cash back can be worth it just for the protections it provides over a debit card, cash, or digital token. A credit card transferring bitcoins can be just as useful as a "traditional" credit card.

Sucks for people buying; is great for people selling and the people that pay taxes and have that money used to pay interest on bonds.

I'd call that technical analysis. I didn't mean to nitpick, and the term "arbitrage" is not always meant to imply purely riskless profit taking. I just thought I was missing something :)
It absolutely looked like two or more parties were heavily demanding liquidity. It's a shame there isn't an optional auction mechanism available for parties looking to transact significant volume without the $5 slippage.

What a juicy market making opportunity! It also looks like Mt.Gox's servers are melting from the pressure.

How could someone pumping and dumping have any impact on arbitrage? Arbitrageurs capturing price differences between exchanges only have to transact when the opportunity presents itself. They don't generally leave orders on the book and get run over by people ripping through the book. Anyone leaving orders on an exchange's book across markets are just making markets cross-exchange.
