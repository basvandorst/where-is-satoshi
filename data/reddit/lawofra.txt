Some already have. Why are so many people so dumb in this thread. This sub is a far cry from its state in 2013.

You were an idiot to have potentially thrown away money then.

According to all the articles I am reading it is being called the segwit2x hard fork.  Why are you saying its not a hard fork?

If they didnt give people their BCC, wouldnt coinbase have been able to pocket everyones BCC and sell it? Isnt that why they were gonna be sued? Those bitcoins in coinbase dont just magically not have bcc attached to them.

Some are arguing that bitcoin core and others in the bitcoin ecosystem profit by keeping the network working at max capacity to make their layer 2 side chains more attractive. What would you say to that? All around I think this was handled very poorly. Updating the network should not have caused so much infighting. When the technology is relatively simple to implement yet things stall something else is going on. People are putting their own self interest ahead of the technology and the vision. Otherwise this network congestion would have been cleared up a long time ago, without 2 forks.

Can you explain why it isnt a hardfork and why its a title? If the coin splits and people have two coins again and the blockchain is bitcoins + the new split. That equals a hardfork doesnt it?

They were going to keep all the BCC for themselves. They controlled the keys they had access to all BCC of their customers BTC. But were not going to credit the BCC to their respective accounts. You really think coinbase would not have claimed that BCC? It would have been  theft.

Why is bitcoin core so adamantly opposed to 2x as to lose the faith of all those businesses and miners to a point they hardfork? Is 2mb blocksize that bad?

To clarify when I said that developers profit from keeping the network congested I didnt mean necessarily financially. I meant they profit by lightning and segwit looking more attractive so that it can be implemented. I wish there was a clear answer to why the developers have it in their best interest not to increase block size. Why the miners want increased block size. Why the developers prefer segwit. Bigger block size was wanted so bad that people are willing to fork over it. Why? Im missing a lot. Could someone point me in the direction about who profits off of all these scaling scenarios? Also on a side note with 52% of mining power and some exchanges and businesses that have agreed to go to 2x that does NOT look very good for bitcoin. Has anyone had an predictions about what will happen? Also it looks like miners are switching to BCC because with the low difficulty it looks like it can be more profitable to mine than bitcoin. Also as far as I can tell BCC is compatible with asicboost. Yet many are saying the soft fork with segwit renders asicboost useless. Yet others are saying it doesnt. Lots of factors here, I wish it wasnt so convoluded and more information was available. A lot of this is politics and I guess the answers to peoples motives is never clear enough for an article.

Im not a BCC supported even if the price was one dollar its still throwing away money. But I agree with you I thought it would drop like a rock too.
