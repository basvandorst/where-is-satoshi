So I could buy a BTC at $1k and then when it’s $10k I ‘gift’ it to my companion who sells it at the price it was when he got it and thus pays no tax (and then give me 99% of the cash back under the table)? Seems fishy, I’m sure it can’t work that way.

So you feel you’re ok for hating racists. Now, some white racists hate black people for what the white racists perceive as anti-white racism from black people. That is, exactly the same motivation you have for your hate. Logically, you must defend and feel kinship with those white racists, even if you hate them, correct?

Right, I’m also fine with taxes and intend to pay them when/if I sell at a profit, but I would also feel better knowing that some future jackbooted government doesn’t suddenly see me as a target for a $5000 wrench attack. I’ve been thinking maybe it would be possible to “sell it” off-exchange to a wallet that is secretly also mine and pay capital gains tax on my “profit” out of the purchase sum, which I would have to somehow pay into my account from some account not controlled by me (so, an accomplice is required, also I’d need the funds in cash since it would look suspicious if I withdraw say $10k to cash from my account only to have the same amount return as my BTC went out). However, the main reason I wouldn’t do something like that is that this way I /could/ also cheat on the taxes (assuming BTC keeps going up) and I wouldn’t want to do something questionable at all. But I think something along those lines might work.

So, it’s not that I can’t sympathize with your sentiments, I just think you’re barking up the wrong tree for technical reasons. But to begin with, I think your characterization of corporations’ free speech being a manifestation of the free speech of its members is useful, so I’ll happily take that approach. Now, when you say:


That is probably the essence of this discussion. I agree that they inflate their speech as you suggest, but I disagree that this would be wrong. Yes, everyone should have the same vote, but demanding everyone have the same ability to leverage their speech doesn’t seem reasonable. With your model above, we might as well talk about rich vs poor people instead, the same argument about imbalance in the reach of your free speech applies. I don’t think it is reasonable to say to someone ”sorry, but your free speech credits are up, you can’t express any more opinions until next year when your balance has been reset”, which is what it would amount to, saying that you have spent the maximum limit on some campaign. If absolute balance in reach is the goal, we would no longer be allowed to have newspapers, or even a box in a park called ”speaker’s corner”. So while I sympathize with your desire for fairness, I think the unintended consequences of an approach like you advocate would lead to even less fairness, and unacceptable limits on free speech.

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I’m talking about.
That said, if you started out with 10 BTC that were aquired via KYC exchange, the government would know that you own 10 BTC even if they don’t know what wallet they are currently in - and they probably don’t care where it is either. If they know you have 10 BTC but you can’t show you are still in possession, they would assume you bought them at $0, sold them at peak price and ask for their tax cut. Sure, if they come to confiscate all your funds (and I guess this is the scenario you consider) you might be able to claim you sold it at market peak (or lost them in a boating accident, same thing as far as IRS is concerned unless you can rigorously prove you really lost your coins with no profit) and offer them the taxes on your trade but manage to keep your coin, is this what you had in mind?

By justifying hating people over perceived racism you justify racists that hate people over perceived racism. This isn’t a particularly hard concept.


Someone said you seem hateful, and rather than object to that you explained it by saying you’re “not a fan”. Then you keep doubling down.
Look, you’re probably just a run of the mill average Joe who thinks by stating your hate for racists you will be seen in a positive light by the rest of society, getting coveted pats on the back. Hating racism is one thing, but offering your hate for human beings in return for social standing is a vile and pathetic behavior.

Right, BUT: ”worry” already by making sure you have careful records of all your purchases, so when the time comes to sell you can calculate your tax.

IRS can ask coinbase for the transaction out of coinbase to see what wallet the bitcoin went to. IRS can then consult the public ledger to see that the bitcoin hasn’t moved out of that wallet.

If they get replies like “zomg yuo doesn’t even know the precise specifics of the attack vector, how can yuo ask question?” then that will do nothing to build confidence in bitcoin for anyone, rather the intelligent reader will conclude that the worries are probably very real and that a deflective community of supporters are hoping to avoid the question.

Same. That’s why I like to point out holes in people’s logic, such as the citizens united post that you are probably busy responding to right now. The Hitler post was mostly a joke, but I will point out that it is technically correct in that regardless of the opinions of other political experts, Hitler did brand his party as nationalist socialist. Arguing about that can be done, but is ultimately about as (non)productive as arguing about if real socialism has ever been tried: people who can’t agree on premises arguing over conclusions.
But you make a rather pointed assumption about me supporting Trump. I don’t really care about Trump (only about cold, hard logic) although I do share your sentiments on caging children. Who, exactly, is responsible for that isn’t entirely clear to me, but given where the buck stops, it’s probably Trump (*). On the other hand, given my love for logic, I see about as many offenders from both camps, for and against Trump. When I point out holes in pro-Trumpers’ arguments I get called a communist, when I shoot down anti-Trump arguments I get called a fascist. What’s fascinating to me isn’t the readiness to project political partisanship by partisans, but their resistance to the very idea that their arguments might have holes.
(*) how could it not be Trump? Well it probably is, but here’s how: in my opinion, it is POSSIBLE that Trump is just a semi-fascist and really more of a centrist, but he gives room to rather darker forces in the republican party. So it could be that Trump isn’t terribly involved other than rubber stamping proposals from his republican fascist party members. But all I’m saying is that I’m not completely able to rule this out, it still seems more likely that it’s Trump, and even if what I described is true that certainly doesn’t absolve Trump from responsibility.

made a very specific prediction in a low information environment, which implies it has a low chance of coming true, which in turn means that there’s a high chance it won’t come true. The counter bet is rational. I don’t have to know anything about bitcoin, I just have to know that OP doesn’t have a good basis for his prediction.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:54:59
Who are you?
@_date: 2019-08-31 03:21:05
Sure, but the point is that increased block size would only lead to lower rewards/bitcoin usage if there were 10 minute periods where no rewards were claimed because no transactions were waiting to be picked up. If there are enough transactions that this never happens, the point is moot, but what I am saying is that I think the point is moot *anyway* because I believe transaction-less blocks are still mined and rewarded just the same.
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:30:46
What? That’s the same correlation. Are you arguing for or against a negative correlation existing between markets and bitcoin?

The hash energy expenditure, afaik, is a function of the competition among miners. Bitcoin price goes up, that makes it worth it for more people to spend the electricity on mining for a chance to get that high price BTC. As more miners enter the fray, the hash solutions are found faster, prompting a difficulty increase to return to a solution every 10 minutes. At some point it becomes so difficult/electricity intensive that it is no longer worth it for new miners to join, and we have arrived at a new equilibrium as a function of bitcoin price and electricity price. As we can see from this, higher bitcoin price inevitably leads to greater electricity consumption, whereas changing the total number of bitcoins, the number of transactions per block, the target time between blocks...none of that will have an impact on the energy use except insofar as it impacts the bitcoin price.
Edit: it also follows that a higher electricity price leads to lower electricity use by bitcoin, so what could actually work in theory though probably not in practice would be a scheme where every government agreed on a pact where each country would by law have a special, really high, price multiplier on electricity only for bitcoin mining. As long as it was the same for everyone, the incentives would work the same as now, but with radically lower electricity usage. The bitcoin protocol could be extended to require energy certificate tokens or similar.

Technical arguments about software are very quickly resolved because the alternatives can be measured in the lab. All the interesting conflicts around Bitcoin are political in nature, by which I don’t mean democrats and republicans but two or more camps speculating differently on human nature, e.g., what features should be prioritized to stimulate adoption and to what extent should we prioritize adoption?
@_date: 2019-08-04 08:21:29
I don’t get it...0.0026 per day, 0.026 per 10 days, 0.26 per 100 days and 2.6 btc per 1000 days which divided by 365 days gives about 2.7 years so about 1 btc / year in a pool, shouldn’t that be about 1 btc / year solo as well?
Edit: doh, 12.5 btc in a block (not 1 btc per block)

@_date: 2019-08-31 03:06:17
I don’t think so because there’s still a block per 10 minutes. If the transactions that would have taken two blocks before can all go into one block now, then I guess there would theoretically be more blocks with no transactions in them, but I believe such blocks are mined too.

$4k to $3k isn’t 10%, that’s a 25% loss. Thus I thought you meant your boss said that the 0.25 * $1400 = $350 that you lost represented 10% of the value of your company, which would then have been $3500. 
But then the question becomes, why would your boss care about $350, assuming it represents a miniscule portion of your sales?
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:39:09
Yes, 9000 is clearly a bigger number than 8000, good call by the translators.

They set up offices and claimed to be a bank, took people’s money, paid interest (not a lot, of course, to avoid raising suspicions), issued mortgages, invested in the local economy, followed all the laws and regulations - everything to make it look like a legit bank. The bastards are still operating, pretending to be a real bank, but I can see right through their shenanigans!
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:30:12
Right now, sure, but as soon as BTC goes above $1M, a satoshi is worth more than 1 cent, meaning we need better resolution than satoshis for micro-payments

@_date: 2019-06-26 03:39:37

No it’s not.

I get what you are saying and assume it to be correct. My question is, what if you get, say, a monthly salary of which you regularly invest a portion. Do you know if it would make any difference to DCA in the intervals, i.e. buy once per week vs once per month? What if it’s once per week vs once per year? If per week is better, would an idealized (no-fee) DCA that exactly followed the market second by second be the best?

This is rather confusing though because I always heard “intrinsic” value used in such a way that gold has intrinsic value because you can make jewelry and electronics with it, and a potato has intrinsic value in that you can eat it, but fiat doesn’t.
However, over in the Buffet bashing thread everyone seem to agree that intrinsic value means the productive output of a company, so an investment in coca cola is an investment in something with intrinsic value since they make coca colas (and pay dividends) whereas investing in gold means investing in something without intrinsic value, since it just sits there. 
Which one is more correct?

@_date: 2019-05-15 07:01:41

Because it already is?
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:05:50
Ah ok, thanks for explaining! I had somehow assumed the trezor would also somehow generate a new wallet for you, and whatever is needed so that I can send my btc from coinbase to that thing.
@_date: 2019-05-20 04:48:31
I don’t get a few of these points, specifically:
Price floor: Say that bitcoin had a price floor at $5. This would be totally irrelevant when buying at $8k. “It didn’t go to zero, it stopped at $5” is useless and equivalent to $0.
Quantum computing: we’re already past 17M/21M. At the time quantum computing could become relevant we’d be closer still. Would it really matter much if the last couple million coins were mined essentially for free? The hard cap seems more important and the proof of work is mostly to keep stock to flow predictable and consistent until we hit the cap. Quantum computers would give a large drop in STF for a liitle while and then we’d be in cap land with no real difference to if quantum computers didn’t exist.
Intrinsic value: seems to me that gold’s intrinsic value is rather irrelevant to its main use case as a non-inflationary value store. Can’t ability to store value be seen as an intrinsic value anyway? Eating your money or wearing it around your neck can’t be the only utility, being non-fakable and securely transferable are utilities that should have a value “inside”. And if that’s just not compatible with definitions, is “intrinsic value” then a relevant concept compared to “having valuable features”?
Just my 2 sat ofc.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:04:54

In such a scenario you’re probably screwed anyway since the state knows you have the bitcoin from scanning the exchange (that we assume they control for your example to make sense) and the blockchain. They’ll just send for you if it’s a sizable amount.

If halving occurs after a set number of blocks, doesn’t that imply that higher activity (more transactions per day) leads to the next halving faster? If that is so, how can we talk about year 2140? Furthermore, shouldn’t activity tend to go up with higher btc price? I.e. if it moons it could lead to faster halvings (perhaps spurring price even more in a feedback loop)?

So for someone just looking to move their longterm hodling off coinbase, I could just download some app on my phone that lets me create a wallet/seedphrase combo, send the btc to it, write down seed phrase and delete the app? That kind of sounds like what I ought to do if I understood this right.

Without checking your post history, I’ll assume it’s clean enough that you can’t be doxxed. Just remember that you can never, ever reveal any personal information on this account in the future after revealing your bitcoin holdings.

Mining regulations: not needed, it’s all in the protocol and there’s no “blood bitcoin” correspondence to “blood diamonds/gold”
Exchange regulations: Yes, this seems like it would be a good thing. I’m thinking we’re heading in that direction and that it will be enabling for bitcoin rather than detrimental.
Taxes: same as for gold already, it’s capital gains tax, which seems about right.
In other words, as exchanges get regulated bitcoin will be regulatorily en par with gold. Sounds good to me unless I’m missing something?

I have wondered about this. My first thought, admittedly, was ‘and the next halving after that, bitcoin will get a even higher stock to flow ratio than gold, and thus become even better money than gold!”
But is there an argument made somewhere that “higher STF = better money” scales infinitely? What if gold is near the sweet spot and the best strategy for btc would be to stop halving at some point?
Not saying this is so, I’m just wondering if we know it ain’t so?
