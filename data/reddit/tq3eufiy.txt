No way, a lot of people are caught in a bulltrap with BCH, and others panic sold BTC at $6800.

Well, but I do believe that if there was a way to check, we would see that the big players made more money out of this, and increased the centralization of the power.

I actually used this account just to post this, I created it a long time ago, but never really used reddit, when I started investing in bitcoin I started lurking /r/ again, but never felt a real need to post, until now, mainly because I wanted to hear what people think.

That is actually my point, I don't think the whales are in agreement with each other, but rather that they instinctively understand (in the sense that this comprehension doesn't have to be self acknowledged) that it is more profitable for this Bitcoin Core x Bitcoin Cash dispute to go on indefinitely.

It actually can, because people inject more money into the crypto economy, or more little players join. Same thing with stocks. In a sense, all systems of exchange are pyramid schemes, in the sense that you need more people to come in the economy, to crush and send more money to the good investors, which is why, at least in my town, I know ten times more people that lost money investing in stock and a couple of people who made a killing.

People don't really care, to be honest, because everyone believes they can time the market perfectly.
