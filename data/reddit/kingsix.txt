ASIC investments are typically made with something like 12 to 18 months time frame in mind so any change with that much prior notice should be possible. It could in fact be MORE profitable for miners, because as soon as the announcement is made all research into ASICs stops and they get a locked in, less competitive market for that time frame.

Governments already [do this]( you just don't see it, because of a mental blockade that prohibits you from questioning your rulers.


We already know there's absolutely no accountability for anything whatsoever in the political sector. Not so on the market.


Don't consent to US law? Move to (Canada, Mexico, Russia, Somalia) 
If I indeed have that ability to choose my law provider, do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing? Do you believe there should be less choice in the matter (world government) or more choice (more localized and competing jurisdictions)? Or is it exactly as it should be? 
By some incredible cosmic coincidence of history the current sizes of legal orders are absolutely perfect and there's no need or possibility for improvement!?

Cryptocurrency starts from one user and zero price, so a price stable cryptocurrency would have a permanent value of zero.

You should start with Bitcoin because it's a cutting edge technology that's shaping up to be the basis of a whole alternative financial system. 
It's good to at least have 'some' bitcoin because once you're IN cryptos you'll be able to do a lot of cool stuff (think TCP/IP for finance). 
Plus there's also the whole upside monetary potential of the bitcoin currency that's often unnecessarily played down.

This community is doing themselves a huge disservice by ignoring the body of research and innovation coming from the "2.0" projects. Some of those technologies may one day end up in the Bitcoin proper and the more scrutiny and real life trial and error happens in this sector the better. 
I'm happy to throw some coin to Vitalik and his team not as an investment but because I believe he has the potential to achieve something technologically significant.
Same with Dan Larimer and his experiments with delegated proof of stake and price-tracking assets. 
There's also nxt, meta-layers, genuine user created assets like LTBC, colored coins etc. 
Unfortunately they're almost all prohibited taboo on because of some elitist hallucinations of bitcoin's supposed perfection and purity.

Drivers will pay whomever they like to vet them and in your app you'll choose which insurers you trust, like: "show me only drivers with 9.5 rating, insured by Allianz, Skynet or PirateBay DAC."
Similarly, drivers could choose to only take customers with verified identities, or with an escrow deposit. 
Currently, identity verification for the purposes of AML/KYC costs just a few bucks, here we can expect they will be done for free by insurers.
Such systems are currently being devised by [FollowMyVote]( for voter verification (independent verifiers) and by OpenBazaar for pseudonymous trading (escrow agents). I'm sure there's something being made on Ethereum also.

Bitcoin mining only resembles gold mining in that the availability of the resource is limited, but unlike with gold, the space for competition is unlimited. Therefore mining profits should tend to be marginal. ASIC MINER happened during a shift to a ASIC, they were the first mover and I wouldn't expect a success like that to repeat ever again.

To say that all the government has to do in order to extract money from it's subjects is to raise taxes is such a childish view that one has to wonder if you've ever put any thought into it besides what you've been told about it in high school. Tax revenues are more or less constant as a percentage of GDP and only marginally dependant on nominal tax rate. That's because traditional taxes can be avoided by hiding more and more of your activity into the shadow sector (or just refusing to do business for less than, say, 50 cents on dollar earned). Modern governments are taxing the private economy at about 40 percent and at that point the only way to extract additional value from the productive sector is to introduce inflation - a form of tax that reaches everyone and is impossible to avoid. The fact that you've never heard of the inflationary tax is mind boggling and only speaks to your apparent  lack of intellectual curiosity.

Value is not internal to objects, rather it is externally assigned by individual market actors based on their subjective understanding of the object's (perceived) properties. Physical properties in case of gold, mathematical in case of Bitcoin.

This. If even a small subsection of potential investors actually realized what Bitcoin really is, each one would be valued at not two, or even four, but many digits. Just think about it: even if you disregard it's social or currency properties, Bitcoin is the only object in the known universe with a known, verifiable, guaranteed, fixed supply. Really, you take some of the most scarce metals on Earth and suddenly their entire supply quadruples with just one asteroid being mined. I suspect that BTC's current low valuation is really a result of not enough faith in "this cryptography thing". But as time passes without any major disruptions I guess more and more people will start seeing it as "proven".

Of course you better encrypt your wallet with a long, random string password. I use Lastpass with two-factor authentication for password generation and storage. 
If you're worried about your history and addresses being visible you can additionally encrypt the file with your file packer of choice.
Once you have your wallet properly encrypted your objective is to copy it to multiple physical locations, NOT to keep it on a single thumb drive or off-line computer. Hard drives and USB sticks WILL fail, that's why I really don't understand the philosophy behind off-line storage. If your wallet is properly encrypted, you can assume it to be public and nobody should be able to do anything with it. 
So use dropbox, google drive, a hosting service (if you have access to one) and just e-mail it to your multiple email accounts. 
Oh, and occasionally start a new wallet so that if your machine gets infected with a keylogger the bad guy only gets a password for the current wallet.

It would also help decentralize the network thanks to all the casually mining hardcore gamers.

That's the secret of succesfull tech journalism: because 90% of startups and projects fail, you can keep predicting "this wont work", "there's no market for that" etc. without doing ANY research, and you'll be right 90 per cent of the time.

Curry is at least cautiously curious about the issue. I tried to explain on his blog why he shouldn't expect a repeat of the bitcoin donations from two years ago (my comment is the "email" he mentions on the show).

The last straw for me was the talk from a brain damaged woman who told audience to try hard and fake confidence so that you can one day make it in academia and give a TED talk. It was surreal like something out of the Onion. Maybe I'll find it later.

If I'm not mistaken "In God we Trust" was borrowed from a prayer. "In Crypto we Trust" sounds like we're worshiping cryptography. Ànd the whole idea behind Bitcoin is to eleminate the need for trust. This is a really bad motto that sounds too gimmicky. "Strenght in numbers" is much better, preferably in Latin, although I'm not sure if "strenght" is what we're looking for either. How about "Certainty in Numbers", or "Mathematical Certainty"?

We're getting somewhere... "The drugged-child-rape terrorism-enabling mass-murder-market technology"?

Don't know what op meant, but I mined on p2pool for a few weeks with my single gpu and it worked great until it decided one day to start consistently paying out only 1/10 of what it previously did. Didn't know how to fix this, so I switched back to Eclipse MC.

Surprisingly few media pieces are actually negative towards Bitcoin. Most are either positive or curiously neutral.

From what I've seen in the discussion so far, folks are missing the most important point:
the reason this would be a absolute **game changer** is that if PayPal starts accepting Bitcoin they would have to start accepting the blockchain as a public proof of delivery in their automatic dispute resolution process. This would enable decentralized exchanges where you could trade BTC with anyone in the world using PayPal without fear of being ripped off, fees, verification, bank wires, dwolla,  ddos bullshit etc.

The point of this 'parity' game is that when someone is considering investing they're not deciding how much arbitrary units of a target asset they want to own. Rather, they look at how much fiat they have available for investment and can more easily conceptualize performance and perspective.
@_date: 2013-06-17 06:30:38
So How much did you donate, OP?
@_date: 2013-07-26 06:06:24
That's even worse. The reason to even mention mining to lay people at this point would be to explain money creation and transaction validation. It's sufficient to just say that money is being released to the users at a predetermined rate in exchange for their computing power.

Sure, people are scared of anything 'math' but here the problem is simply that the term 'complex mathematical problems' is bullshit and people can sense that. 'What problems.?? What are you talking about? You think I'm an idiot? Why can't you just tell me? Cause its a scam!'

Ha ha, yes, my question regards  specifically "my GF is TG". Now re-reading I'm realizing that even with this short simple statement I'm making some unwarranted assumptions. (Of course they don't have to be bi, and besides, a distinction like that is probably pointless and artificial to some people)

So I guess their criticism revolves around rising hash difficulty, but why expect an average end-user of a currency to be able to mint it? That had merrit in it's infancy as a way of bootstraping the system. I find it especially frustrating, since Gibson was one of the first mainstream pundits who "got it". His podcast from two years ago was a great introduction to the technical basics of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:15:52
Say I run a 40% pool. I give in to social pressure and split it to two 20% pools. What changed? I still control the same amount of hashing power.

This is probably none of my business, since I'm not a member, but it seems that the two weakest people are in the lead for the individual seat.  Meyer is a radical and even though I mostly agree with what he has to say, he has no business representing anyone but himself. Elizabeth answers in the debate came off as pre-written, vapid PR speak. Like a high-schooler who learnt enough buzz words to impress her teachers without any underlying understanding of the subject.

I think that at one point in the interview he was a word away from mentioning Austrian economics but decided there's no point confusing the viewers.
I get the feeling that Gavin is constantly restraining himself to sound more main-stream than he really is, which is commendable, considering the spotlight he's in.

Be interesting to see how many of those receive BTC and how many convert to fiat.

Economization of public goods was one of the original promises of Bitcoin. A p2p network is a pure public good as it is unowned and scarce and therefore susceptible to the tragedy of the commons. This becomes painfully obvious whenever a highly popular movie or game hits the net. Suddenly masses of people are trying to download it on asynchronous connections limiting network's average speed to the level of their DSL's upload speed. Bitcoin integration could enable leechers to pay for prioritized access and seeders to earn money for sharing their bandwidth with the network.

Downvoting for pointlessness. How can you even have a 4.5 minute "debate"? With no room for arguments, rebuttals, just empty, idiotic one-liners? And they call it GREAT?? It's fucking offensive.
Television is intellectually on a level of a schoolyard shouting match. I wish it died already so humanity can regrow some brain tissue...

The whole 'complex mathematical equations' bit is confusing and pointless. Anyone who mentions it immediately losses half the audience.  It needs to be dropped.

No, the purpose of government is to exercise control over the state's victims. Now, sometimes the victims will tell themselves stories in order to cope with the abuse (like you do above) but it's really no different from an abused child blaming himself for being molested by the parent.
