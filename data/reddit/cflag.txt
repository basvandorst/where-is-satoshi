It's not satire. Movie quotes are expected to be overly dramatic.


All of those need to be seriously discussed. Probably won't amount to anything. Possibly will lead to changes in perspective. Maybe Bitcoin will be of use. I don't understand what not discussing "unrealistic" desires will accomplish.
Exact same optimism can be observed on other topics, say, Esperanto. However its critics do not dedicate themselves to trolling on forums, they mostly ignore it altogether. What is so different about the politics of Bitcoin?

Thanks for your response. So there is still no way to extend it to "higher level ideas" (without patents I suppose).
I don't know. One of my hobbies was re-implementing libraries and tools in functional languages, using functional paradigms, which removes any possibility of using these "little details".
People not being able to shamelessly build proprietary software on copied code does work for large codebases like Linux or LibreOffice, but I'm not sure it is *that* important for Bitcoin (and may not be a good trade-off even).
Maybe it's better to have the core development in BSD and all surrounding tools and libraries in L/GPL. Separating Bitcoin Core in two might make sense in this case.
Anyway, I guess most of this is off-topic.

Deceptive, if you believe that rushing to squeeze the network is the only way to create a healthy fee market.
Hearn's argument is not that we don't need layer 2 protocols in order for Bitcoin to scale (wasn't payment channels his idea?), but creating artificial emergencies will not result in what everyone expects.
I've been using Bitcoin daily for years and wallet software barely began to do what I want "easily", sort of. Same goes for exchanges, etc. The market will not just magically produce user friendly solutions doing much more complicated stuff if you push it "hard enough".

Well, the decrease (if it is really 95%) obviously doesn't have linear correlation with the size of the blockchain, so I don't understand why we should extrapolate linearly.
Using bitcoin-core for ordinary transactions is cumbersome, and most users won't be using it directly. I stopped using it years ago, and wouldn't be running bitcoind at all if I didn't care about the network. As long as it requires its own standalone machine, the difference between a 50G and 400G doesn't matter *that* much, if any.
We are pretty close to the edge, but we wouldn't be in a completely different place at 8M. This no compromise policy will potentially result in 8G blocks, however.

"Research" is not a solution, the actual working product is. People had ideas, these were debated, implemented, refined, etc.
After you know what the working solution is, re-implementing it is not a colossal work for something at the scale of Bitcoin. So my question is, does copyleft offer any protection against such re-implementations?
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:57:35
Being too anal about this can have disastrous consequences, too.
Why not have the solutions first and assess *their* risks before destroying something that is working right now?


I'm inclined to believe you, but this needs better arguments. "A reasonably skilled person can trivially perform double-spends" (quoting davout below), yet zero-conf commerce is working almost perfectly. I'm not saying game theory is wrong.

Decent point otherwise.

I agree to all points. It's important to note that casual "Bitcoin haters" are pretty much the same genre of Internet people as the Bitcoin pumpers.
However I think blaming enthusiasm is counter-productive, as it puts off genuinely excited people and does nothing to the above group. The biggest problem is the communication technologies we are using, such as Reddit.

This doesn't sound too different than pushing them to enable it, except it will be many years earlier than your scenario.


I guess this is the gist of the debate. You want to steer the market into doing something you think needs to be done. Similar to the blocksize limit and centralization issues.
On one hand, it makes a lot of sense. On the other, all of this could end in people switching to centralized "solutions" like Coinbase, which is not very unlikely IMHO.
As a user, I enjoy my zero-conf transactions. I also suspect that user-friendly instant-confirmation solutions will not come without some sort of compromise.

Well, it's the only way it can be done *by design*.
Having said that, I don't understand why you call it democratic. Bitcoin doesn't have governance and there are no barriers for involvement. Any person has the opportunity come up with some code and if it's good enough, achieve near consensus and "upgrade" the network, with zero involvement of anyone remotely resembling a leader.
In the ideal case, previous achievements should also have no influence when discussing ideas, so it's technically not a meritocracy either.
The core Bitcoin community is attempting to do something that has never been done before, the methods they use are makeshift, environment (mildly) hostile. Every new step involves awkward social circumstances, onerous tasks and risky moves. All signs of actual human progress.

Zero-conf transactions are quite reliable right now, which is hard to explain. It's not like RBF was rocket science before today.

In my limited understanding, in principle, if you can't "force" someone to pay even if they are unsuccessful/poor/don't have the money, it can't be Riba.
In this case, I think "money plus shares" is not an accurate interpretation, since you can't get any other capital out if you can't get any profit shares either. It's still a profit-sharing agreement, where the investor doesn't get anything if the business is not profiting.
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:48:28
Well, nobody said it has to be 100% Bitcoin. The advantage of Bitcoin is not having to rely on custodians while not losing the ability to make non-local transactions. Its disadvantage is that it's immature, hence volatile.
To be frank, this crisis made me convert some of my bitcoins into USD, gold and real estate (outside Europe). I expect Bitcoin to continue climbing into maturity, but I will try to keep it as less than half of my portfolio. If I had none, I would buy some.

I agree with that perspective in general, but don't understand how promoting RBF can be called "moving on". It looks more like "pushing for".
Also, I don't think we have good enough analysis about the nature and extent of risk. It would more likely reveal itself as a gradual increase in fraud rather than a massive network wide attack, leaving ample time for the market to switch to existing alternatives.

@_date: 2014-10-28 08:44:53
No, it's not a huge win.
The "win" is gradually happening in the form of obsolescence of custodial systems, getting replaced by transparent multi-sig models and opensource peer-to-peer solutions. All top-down rules are damaging to this progress.
Bitcoin for me, and I'm sure most of its supporters, is about creating a new environment from scratch. Mistakes are how it evolves. Don't get steered by those who claim that they have proved their point each time these events happen. Turning Bitcoin into one of the countless regulated payment platforms will not help anyone. You can already use them. If Bitcoin will fail if left alone, then it should.
Also, don't imagine that there are people burned by the MtGox fiasco who are now shouting from the rooftops calling for regulation. This doesn't exist, and for a good reason. People like having a choice and can handle failing. You are free to not use Bitcoin at all.
May you also be reminded that many state authorities around the world have published reports informing the consumers that they will not be "protected". This should have been the end of the deal.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:38:39

So, the only difference is, MtGox burns to the ground and Mark goes to prison. I don't care about any of it. Actually, I think gox.com can be very profitable in the long run.
If they act transparently about the accounts, return the recovered portion to us, invest in a new secure platform (AFAIK there are some out there for sale, and they won't cost millions) and real professionals, and continue paying a portion of their profits proportionally to current creditors, would it make sense?
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:49:00

I don't think there is any reason for obsessing about it if you are not pumping a huge amount of generated random data to the outside world (e.g. online wallet). Even if entropy_avail is low, urandom should be able to generate good enough randoms for a long while.
I *would* worry, however, about a closed-source RNG.

Just a few hours ago I got criticized for recommending mining on p2pool nodes operated by others, so I feel obligated to reiterate the concern.
If possible, run Bitcoin Core and install your own p2pool instance. The whole point of p2pool is decentralizing mining power. The only way to ascertain that is to stop giving block generation authority to others.
I still think the stop gap solution of directing to p2pool nodes helps, but preferably and eventually we need to start mining in our own nodes. That's the core principle of a trustless network.
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:53:23


I don't think this can work with direct Bitcoin addresses anyway, so that worry is not even moot.
I think something that uses the Bitcoin "payment protocol" would be ideal. You not only get strict proof of purchase and an invoice, but AFAIK can also pull a new payment address and an exchange-adjusted amount.

Whatever you do, keep in mind that you won't get the same wallet when you use a passphrase.
Trezor accepts an empty passphrase, but I haven't tried whether it's the same as not enabling the passphrase. If it is (just realized that klokanx confirmed it), you can do (2), get the address, unplug/plug the device and enter an empty passphrase, do the transfer to the new address.

You don't use intermediaries "like CoinBase" to secure your bitcoins. It doesn't make any sense, since if your computer is compromised, your coinbase coins can be stolen just like your local coins. So actually no irony there, you just keep the coins in cold storage; quite the opposite of giving control to trusted entities.
Prevent theft? Back up your encrypted cold storage wallet. This is very basic stuff.
Intermediaries are useful for things like instant confirmation and prevention of theft from compromised systems (e.g. using multisig as a second factor).

I thought Bitcoin deals with Sybil very cleverly. In what way do you think it's a problem, and what improvements would you like to see?
What are the applications of isolation attacks in the context of Bitcoin? Essentially, are they worth it? This is very similar to what's discussed in the new paper about running Bitcoin nodes under tor. While they should not be too difficult to deal with (Bitcoin currently doesn't even try that hard), I think developing measures without them becoming a practical problem is a bit premature. This is more about security philosophy than anything else.
Finney attacks are dealt with by waiting for confirmations for important transactions. It has an attached cost, so is not a problem for transactions below that. Current norm seems to be waiting for confirmations for amounts magnitudes lower than what a Finney attack would cost. Green addresses, etc. also address this attack.
The others relate to mining incentives, and you are right about their practical importance. Saying no one fixes them is a bit of an exaggeration though. There are many proposals roaming about, some of which are promising, but they are not elegant enough to be accepted right away. Altcoins are a good playground for testing these proposals.
In summary, flat-out rejections of Bitcoin based on edge cases are usually misguided. I'll drop this here for further debate: 
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:51:30


Decentralized networks are immensely inefficient compared to centralized networks. The only reason we use them is because they can't be controlled by central authority. We use them because they are flat.
If you already have authority, you can create a centralized payment service that has instant and completely free transfers, with no wasted energy for excessive data redundancy or mining, and even optional provable anonymity (e.g. for bureaucrats). It will have no weaknesses of Bitcoin, and no additional weaknesses other than being centralized.
So there are two ways this can go.
Either; the US comes out with their own crypto-currency, which is perfectly decentralized. It will basically be identical to Bitcoin, other than some initial parameters and cryptographic algorithms, maybe. It would be competing with Bitcoin for the global market, but barring some backdoor I can't imagine why a government would want this, and why other governments would be more welcoming. I personally would welcome such a development, but it will never happen anyway.
Or else, the US comes out with a currency that resembles Bitcoin to the public but actually isn't decentralized at all, and fails miserably while politically supporting the idea that Bitcoin is a useful technology even the State wants to imitate.
tl;dr Not likely.

As I see it, AML regulations are there mostly to stop money flowing to organizations you don't politically agree with (armed + politically disagreeable == terrorist). I'm not specifically talking about the USA. Every government does that. If you don't agree with USA's definitions of terrorism, then you stay in the gray or black lists, but you still do it within your own political reach and have your own lists.
More recently, after establishing control, USA began using this structure against tax evasion. You can observe in this subreddit, old timers (i.e. 40+ people who have dealt with AML regulation in their lives) who say that AML regulations are good but they have no relevance to tax issues. I think these people were well intended and sincerely believed in the boundaries. Also, the lack of justification was not so blatantly obvious, at least for people without access (like us), just a decade ago.

I think standardized near-free third-party arbitration options (e.g. pay only if there is a dispute) would be very useful for consumers who prefer Bitcoin.
On the other hand, non-reversible payment options lets you bypass identity-verification or card-verification steps, which takes effort and time (sometimes days), so as a consumer I like having this option as well.

Encrypt your message before sending it. There is really no other way anyway, since you will always give the decryption secret to the recipient using a different channel independent of the implementation.
Also, don't automatically trust e-mail or the recipient's system. Put clear instructions before the encrypted message. You will still have to trust the recipient's intellect though, but I guess it's inevitable.

Yes, elegance is an elusive concept.
I think (or maybe speculate) that it can be called messy from an academical standpoint because there are many components that rely on social assumptions. Then again, many things that do work in real life are not obvious on the drawing board. In a way, these assumptions become proven facts as these systems become convincing enough. Bitcoin has a long way to go to establish itself in this way, at which point we won't be debating these issues.

If we are talking about a theoretical future where you can pay all your costs in Bitcoin, then I suppose it is at least possible that you could use pass-through services to pay your taxes. There is a case to be made, because banks are also private enterprises and you should not be forced to use them. Then again, some countries already force bank transfers by law.
Another, less convenient option to pass-through services is over the counter cash exchanges or Bitcoin ATM's.
Of course, another option is moving your business to somewhere you don't have to pay taxes, but assuming it is still governed by a state, then they will ask for fees and whatnot for everything, so you will still need to convert to fiat, until they accept coins for them as well.
Yet another option could be running under a superstructure which interfaces with the "governed" world. In this case, businesses can both be independent legal entities, or structures defined in the generic company's bylaws.

Multi-sig might have prevented the theft, but so would putting any other measure in place. For large amounts, I think we should avoid recommending multi-sig by itself. It's a good measure against compromised computers, but would not withstand targeted attacks.
Off-line wallets are the way to go of you are storing hundreds. You could use them together with multi-sig for increased security of course.

I am all for consensus, but you can't have it for a large group. On the other hand, you can't do without it, since no one wants tyranny of the majority.
Therefore what you need is multiple governance models in superposition which people can opt in and out freely. These could involve something like voting within themselves or meritocratic properties. They also don't need to be completely separate structures, so in this sense Bitcoin fits as a sample component of such a system.
If this makes sense, then we can see "decentralized government" not as an application, but a variety of tools that people use to settle things between themselves. Some of these are already in a form that is almost decoupled from central governance, and can be easily developed into fully decentralized systems. Currency, notarization and dispute mediation are examples.
A *very* limited form of this can be made to work in parallel with the conventional governance structures, as we can see with Bitcoin. Enforcement is also possible with economic means (e.g. ostracization), but its absolute effect is very limited. Therefore to achieve efficiency, this sort of system requires a fundamental structure that can support its abstract nature, which includes a minimal protocol that applies to all governance models.

Last time academics (that I respect a lot) worked on it, they claimed they found a connection between Satoshi and DPR, which turned out to be a completely different person instead of Satoshi and no connection to DPR at all. It's not a "forensic accountant's dream" by a huge margin.
Anyway, what you do is, use separate wallets (sometimes called pockets, or accounts) for separate identities. You need to obfuscate the connection between these pockets, and it can be done reasonably well, especially for smaller sums.
As an online privacy recommendation, try to use separate IP's, and separate web browser profiles. Even better, separate users/virtual machines/computers. These are far more likely to cause privacy leaks than the "all eternity" thing.

Last time I checked there were very few choices. My reasoning is, if there were a high enough demand, at least some miners would consider switching to a pool that supports it. Even if the percentage is very little, it directly translates to loss of revenue so pools then would consider offering the option.
However, I'm pretty ignorant about the more current intricacies of mining. If there isn't an efficient enough implementation, it adds to the time cost for pools and certainly makes switching unlikely for miners.

Keep in mind that topological considerations are an important part of the puzzle. You can cause a lot of overhead or propagation and node discovery delays even if your upload/download ratio is high. Also, how you affect the network depends on node implementations and therefore changes over time.

I don't think he's retarded.
To my experience Bitcoin transactions take up to 5 seconds to propagate to the destination, usually much less than that (not enough to notice), assuming there aren't connectivity issues on either side. Connectivity issues can happen though, so it wouldn't be right to dismiss them.
"Illegal" transactions don't propagate. What you could do is, try a network based attack on the recipient. If the recipient takes reasonable precautions, this becomes very costly, so saying it is fine for small purchases is not retarded.
What's likely missing is good enough heuristics for POS systems to measure the node's vulnerability to such attacks. Since most systems delegate it to third parties, I don't think enough work is done on this front.
If the above somehow doesn't work well enough, I'm assuming most systems will turn to green addresses. Either way, it is doable, but it is not clear what the best approach is until practical attacks begin happening.
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:06:42
Most ideas behind Bitcoin and its inefficiency is to be resistant to attacks that are possible in networks that require network-wide synchronization of stuff.
I'm not saying it is perfect or anything, but these are harder problems than most people imagine.


But how do you measure time? Since we cannot trust any single entity (especially the miner) to report the correct time, block propagation interval is a very uncertain variable, and coming up with a consensus is almost impossible because of the structure of the peer-to-peer network and such delicate measurements being perfectly vulnerable to Sybil attacks, the wiser choice is moving the scale way up. The Bitcoin network measures time every 2016 blocks, which is statistically very reliable.
Of course, you could calculate the block reward instead of the difficulty every 2016 blocks, too. Though, see below.


Still, there has to be an absolute minimum interval anyway for decent propagation, and going below a certain threshold (which we currently don't know) will result in more orphan than good blocks and prevent the network from scaling up.
So, as long as we don't get rid of the chain structure, we still end up with having to guess the minimum interval. If we have a minimum interval, then having a variable interval isn't that useful.
I'm personally happy with Bitcoin's 10 minutes. Better have a more resilient network than being sorry later. You can't go below a couple of minutes anyway, so instant transactions will always have to rely on something other than proof of work.
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:35:06
I understand your viewpoint, but we also need to understand that you can't run everything on immediate superficial self interest. The mere desire for a more livable society is of course still superficial self interest, but it is prone to tragedy of the commons. Furthermore, wherever some form of superrational behavior can be taken into account to a large extent, great things can happen without any coercion.
In this specific case, we are wary of an entity that might gain more by harming Bitcoin, for instance by seizing the control of GHash.io. The competition within the Bitcoin mining market is not necessarily different than other coins, so they are equally susceptible.
Now, either we as a community act with a more enlightened form of self interest, or we ask others with resources to help fix the problem for us ("devs" or whatever). The latter may get us out of the current trouble, but that attitude will not lead us to a better future. The profit motive here is creating a society we can count on. This can be best explained with Kantian philosophy, but if I remember correctly, even Ayn Rand's John Galt acted with the same motive.

But the only purpose of mining is the zero-trust model you mentioned. You trust in yourself, so owning all the miners (it is indeed possible to require mining licenses through a digital certificate system, and you can always give out only one) automatically eliminates the need for mining.


Centralized currencies can also take advantage of distributed computing and storage, without introducing public traceability.


You don't have double spending problem (i.e. forgery) in a centralized electronic issuer + processor system.
The whole deal with cryptocurrencies is that they solve these issues in a decentralized setting. These problems don't exist in a centralized system.

Obviously so. Maybe I should have emphasized more that it's not clear one way or the other.
Nonetheless I can stand behind my conclusion. Regardless of the complexities in the process, in the lack of a (dominant) mining reward, the resulting total power consumption will converge to a value required by the amount of security the user base demands.


Also, the miners could demand higher fees in the absence of a block reward, so the actual numbers would vary. It's hard to reason about, since 0.4% is obviously too low.


There are just too many unknowns there, but I suspect that it won't have a dramatic effect on the outcome.

I'm not an expert, but here is why I care.
In some cases custodial systems are preferable by the customer. For instance, when you use a Bitcoin exchange, you want the exchange to happen without you being available to validate, and others want your offers to be valid and available instantly.
Some other use cases are automated payments, free off-chain transactions or true micro-transactions.
In the voting pool setup, a single entity cannot initiate transactions, and off-chain transactions are signed by multiple notaries. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how withdrawals work though.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:46:28
Multisig is just another function, though I guess it's complicated because you have to get all the signatures in one place somehow. [BIP 10]( seems relevant.
There are also [some interesting examples]( [in the wiki](

@_date: 2014-10-13 05:40:06
Not really. First of all, transactions that go through without the need for arbitration don't necessarily need to pay. It really depends on the implementation. And transaction fees are really incomparable to credit card fees (which you claim don't exist, for god knows why).
Exchange fees are mostly irrelevant I think. Bitcoin is not a tool for you to transfer fiat. It may or may not be used for that to replace especially very expensive remittance services, but that wouldn't work on the consumer side.
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:57:13
No, honestly not. "Devs" is not really a proper entity, and when we use the word, we don't really know what sort of organization structure we are talking about. It usually implies a meritocracy, which you can instantly be a part of by having a good idea. At any moment, an "outsider" can come up with a new "policy", fork the chain and if the change really proves to be necessary, take the user base away. The set of people who are policy makers in Bitcoin are everyone who like coming up with policies. Rest is purely the choice of the user base.

A web of trust would be the next step, if ever, but I don't think we'd need a certificate authority. Giving the capability of adding a "work generation" fee into the block could be enough of an incentive to run these full nodes, since their success rate will be related to the work they distribute.

I've been mining intermittently for the past 4 years (began with solo mining), and used p2pool when it came out for a few months. I got slightly better payouts on average than centralized pools.
However, "experience" doesn't mean much. The bottomline is, there is no reason for p2pool being inefficient.
The reason people don't mine on p2pool is, it is harder to set up (requires full node) and has higher variance (because it's small).

@_date: 2014-05-24 17:03:45
It is being discussed here now and again.
Basically, the number of transactions and mining difficulty are completely disconnected. It doesn't create an additional cost for the miners to include more transactions.
Currently there is a big mining reward (25 coins per block, which will eventually go down to 0 when all coins are issued), which is given away regardless of whether there are any transactions in the block. So, when the exchange rate goes up, the "cost per transaction" goes up with it. When number of transactions increases, the "cost per transaction" goes down.
So essentially I don't think it's a very useful metric, since it reflects initial currency distribution more than the actual "cost per transaction".
The core of the issue is, there is an expectation that the number of transactions will go extremely high in the future, which has resulted in the exchange rate to skyrocket. Which in turn increased the value of the block reward.
Keeping in mind that the mining reward will eventually disappear, and that the expectation that Bitcoin will catch on will not go on forever, there are only two outcomes. Either the value collapses, which results in "cost per transaction" going down with it, or number of transactions per block increases tremendously, which results in "cost per transaction" going to negligible levels.

While I agree that it is too early to be extremely confident about (which may be a requirement for financial products in some cases), your concerns are mostly centered on the codebase. I would check out alternative implementations like btcd.
On the other hand, would you trust a piece of software that had flaws, has been attacked constantly and demonstrated that it can recover, or an elegant and clean re-implementation? I suspect this is being debated since the very first programmers.
I hope you won't think I'm putting words into your mouth again, but as you said, confidence in the code increases as time goes by. But new implementations don't start from scratch either, they are built with already existing experience gathered by the original (which I think was your point, too). So, new implementations will eventually be considered strong enough, and even better.
I don't see any reason to change the unit of account though. Maybe economic concerns could spark it, but it doesn't seem very likely at this point.

Actually, I never used an ad blocker on principle, until recently it came bundled with a private browsing plug-in. Looking back, I think it has been a decade long waste of attention span, bandwidth and privacy.
I don't remember ever clicking ads with the intention of spending money, and they are a nuisance for me, so it is pretty clear that they are not an efficient solution to the problem in my case. The ads are never targeted anyway, because I prefer not to be tracked. 


I would be glad to pay for quality content. Paywalls are a bit disappointing though, but user friendly payment/donation buttons and maybe incentivizing payers to donate to keep the site free might help. Actually, I think Flattr is missing the opportunity by not implementing almost-zero fee Bitcoin-&gt;Bitcoin micropayments right away.
The problem is, there aren't that many people like me. I don't think it will happen any time soon, but if there were a generic protocol that semi-automatically donated to sites I visited and liked, it could work for everyone. Ad-blockers would still be "cheating" though.
Similarly, instead of paying a standard fee for each movie I watch before I see them, I would gladly pay a multiple of that amount for those I liked. Unfortunately, such an ecosystem would need a culture that supports it, and we don't have that right now.

You don't hear older people speaking about these things around you because they know when and where to speak. They don't like unnecessary scrutiny or petty quarrels and couldn't care less about being responsible for others' stupidity. They also tend to care more about enjoying themselves than revolutionary social changes, because they are almost always tired. 
Drugs can be dangerous, especially for younger people. They are also worth experiencing, and can help you understand life better (as with any experience). I would work on curing stupidity and creating close-knit communities where sharing wisdom or asking for help is not frowned upon, rather than prohibiting drugs and leaving users alone and ignorant.

Since you use centralized repositories, signature verification can be done very easily, and popular OS's already do that.
Blockchain is more useful for digital proof of ownership. While you used to be able to give your physical book, cassette tape or game disc to someone, transferring the ownership legally and clearly, there is no equivalently reliable way to transfer ownership of digital content, which pretty much dominates the market now. Actually, even transferring the content between your own devices/accounts can be problematic.
Digital scarcity provided by Bitcoin is a very precise solution for this.

All that encryption protects you against theft of the USB drive. If you have done all this on a computer that has the ability to become online, or you will use the funds in the future using such a device, then you are not protected against malware.
I know many people are paranoid about BIOS viruses and such, but using an offline wallet (i.e. private keys are never ever seen on an online machine) on a computer booted with a live optical is still safer in comparison. Offline Electrum can be recommended. Of course, rebooting etc. takes time and still requires the knowledge to run the live OS, so if you don't want to use a separate "hot" wallet, Trezor is the best option.
Finally, encrypted paper wallets are pretty safe for "savings" wallets, since you can make multiple copies of each and divide the funds into as many wallets as you like so that you won't lose all of it to malware in the case of spending them on an infected computer.

Not at all really. You just enter the pin, check the address displayed (which you should be doing anyway) and click "confirm". The device displays an additional warning if the transaction fee is above average.
Firefox asked me whether I would want to use "MyTrezor" as my default wallet and I accepted, so it is usually a single click before that, pretty much the same as any wallet.
There is also the additional "passphrase" option, which you need to enter twice when you connect the device, but not for each transaction.

I'm guessing you can generate both transactions at once, but broadcast the second first. An attacker won't be able to generate the transaction without knowing the details of the first one, and it is very unlikely for them to succeed in replacing the second transaction with their version after it has already propagated.

Yes. There is a protocol (GetBlockTemplate) that gives the miners the option to know the content and decide whether to participate, but not many pools use it.
Yes, IP addresses are visible, and transactions are clear (i.e. not encrypted). However, it is still not trivial to determine if an IP is the originator of the transaction or is merely relaying it.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:09:37


Depends on the solution. A change in the mining protocol and mining clients which puts miners in charge of block creation can end this once and for all. Not every small miner needs to switch protocols, but larger miners can take back some or all control of the blocks they hash for, given the means, while at the same time enjoying the benefits (if any) of mining on a large pool.

Thank you, this changed my view about some recent topics. Also felt more guilty about not doing much.


This doesn't strike me as an imminent danger. Is it? What are the attack vectors here?


So what you're saying is, once running a full node becomes too expensive for the hobbyist (because of the increased blocksize), mining bases and payment gateways will be running the show. And miners will be indirectly influenced by the actors (who already have influence over mainstream payment processors) who can pressure the manufacturers. Am I on the right track?
I've always assumed this would happen eventually, and counted on the fact that the world is a vast place that would provide enough groups with conflicting interests for this to become a problem. Of course, how things have progressed till now has changed my view about the world, and it doesn't seem that vast anymore. :-)

Not necessarily.
Strictly speaking, regulation is not possible in the current Bitcoin network. Whenever a hard fork happens, you have the choice to remain in whichever network you want, and you can even use both of them concurrently. It's not a democracy.
The reason people will favor one over the other is the merit itself. Is the one more secure than the other? What do merchants prefer? What do exchanges endorse? So in the end, the people who have direct influence would be the more respected developers, most preferred payment services, exchanges, etc.
People with money have a lot to worry about, so they will indirectly influence stuff through financing developers and controlling parts of the outer structure, though they can't force anyone to choose one network over the other. It's also not a bad thing, since you wouldn't expect Bitcoin owners to want to purposefully harm the network.
Actually, no one wants the network to really fork, since it will affect both networks badly, so consensus is "almost" a requirement. This is bad for wild new ideas, but should keep all potential minorities happy.

They could warn the public about uninsured deposits, which is a very similar "concern" to the Bitcoin one. Actually they should have warned the public about all deposits, considering the exposure.


I don't mean to say that it's not the bankers' fault, but everything goes through the government, so there is a very thin line between not intervening and endorsing.


If you imagine the same exact setting and just remove some enforcement, I'm pretty sure it would be even worse. However, no regulation also means a more colorful market (though not necessarily in a good way) and shrewd consumer (consider all the warnings about Bitcoin). Maybe this applies more to Iceland than Cyprus but one of the main problems seems to be the trusting and lax behavior of the public, which is understandable considering they are actually left in the dark by the agencies that are supposed to be representing them.
With the risk of getting off-topic; I think our current economical system is a house of cards, and the part of the Bitcoin ecosystem that's been mimicking it is also failing miserably. By no regulation, I tend to imagine transcending the need for it rather than mere removal or avoidance. Neo&amp;Bee is a step in the right direction, but we have a long way to go to have something I can call truly resilient.

Gold doesn't function as a currency anywhere. Even at the currently minuscule market cap, Bitcoin is likely being used far more frequently for ordinary transactions than gold.
Gold isn't good for small transactions, because it's hard do carry around, hard to preserve and hard to divide. It isn't good for large transactions because it's risky and regulated.
What corresponds to trying to smuggle gold through a border in your rectum in the Bitcoin realm? Memorizing a random phrase. And it doesn't even show on an x-ray.
Basically, technology killed gold as a currency. Fiat didn't replace gold forcefully, people stopped using gold altogether and began trading in gold IOU's, because gold doesn't conform with the needs of the modern society. Transitioning to fiat isn't so tricky when you are already holding all the money.
However, I agree that it has good properties as a store of value. Then again, in my area, I couldn't find a single buyer for gold that would give me a better deal than %10 below the spot price.
A large portion of my extended family are gold dealers by the way (unfortunately I left the country and can't take my gold there to sell). I have seen people buy and sell gold as a store of value, but never seen anyone exchange it for something other than fiat.
Do I *prefer* gold as a store of value? Not so much. I own some gold, but I don't think its scarcity justifies its price. Land, on the other hand, is likely to be valuable for a long time. That would be my choice for a store of value.

I've never been to Ghana, and don't know how their banking system works. Do you?


I'm just assuming abroad is not very broad. I have a couple of times paid around 30% in fees for depositing to a foreign currency account at a bank I don't have an account with. One of the banks was charging fees even if you had an account with the bank, but with a different branch, though they eventually dropped it.


I believe you. Then again, this isn't the case everywhere. And it is usually about laws, so you can't just go and tell people to switch to a better local bank. And yes, many places require ID for deposits ("terrorism", baby), and not only deposits. I was once asked a copy of my passport just for currency exchange.

That's a bit simplistic. First, the money you will "lose" is minuscule. Second, your actions are not isolated; if you leave the network, chances are that others will follow. Third, (depending on your philosophical perspective of rationality) the fact that you are taking an action means that others like you might be taking it as well.

You can support free markets, lack of political hierarchy and capitalism and not be arrogant towards alternative solutions. It works.
I don't think the mindset you are talking about in the first part of your comment is an effect of libertarianism, but instead American libertarianism is nurtured in the same environment and therefore has the same ailment. ~~Since we are already being racist, I think this is mostly an Anglo-Saxon problem, which works pretty much the same way, though producing different maxims, in a socialist setting.~~ EDIT: Scratch that, the problem is widespread, but I think it only produces different maxims in a socialist setting, and is still as harmful and discomforting.

Unless they completely ban all encrypted traffic they can't decrypt, all freedom lovers would adopt a common protocol, which would make it hard to detect the application. If they disallow generic protocols, you can always hide the data in a popular protocol that supports encryption. If they only allow clear traffic, something based on steganography could be attempted. Of course, they can also ban all p2p communication and require licensing and regular audits for servers. So on and so forth.

There is a possibility that malware creators might attack full nodes with vulnerable systems to steal coins, but there aren't any generic attack vectors as of now, and even then the potential for profit is unclear. So I wouldn't get paranoid unless you are keeping an important amount of coins there (not keeping any makes sense even).

Bitcoin adoption scenarios are completely formed of chicken and egg problems. Volatility is just one of the many obstacles that lie ahead, but I don't think their prospects differ much from the ones we've already overcome.
Regarding volatility; exactly how much it will prevent further adoption is hard to guess.
One contribution to a solution could be funds adopting strategies that involve Bitcoin. Higher liquidity means less volatility. Though I don't think this will result in a definitively stable exchange rate.
Further stability might be a result of growing number of use cases. Although currently primitive, completely free online auction markets, decentralized crowdfunding, autonomous companies, trustless stock exchanges, etc. might gain more acceptance in the coming years.
Yes, you already told us not to tell you about inflation in other countries' currencies. Yet, people who live in those countries have a different perspective about the importance and "predictability" of it; believe me I know. Unfortunately, most these countries have a very unpredictable political environment as well, so I personally don't expect the solution to come from there either, at least until Bitcoin becomes widespread in the developed world. Bureaucrats of the developing nations like imitating rather than leading. Yet, if Bitcoin is here in a few years, I think this will begin to happen.
Of course, failing mainstream economic structures will always help as well.
My personal view is, Bitcoin became too popular too soon, hence the extreme volatility. Instead of it spreading through fringe experiments, it became an important vehicle for speculators, a disruptive tech play for venture capitalists and a huge revenue stream for miners. I don't mean that this is a bad way to grow, but all of it didn't change the fact that all of the above scenarios need to work out in parallel for the exchange rate to become stable.

I don't see any way around this phase, but I think we can get across.
Currently, business costs are mostly paid in fiat, so it makes sense to set your prices to the equivalent value in bitcoins. The ability to pay in Bitcoin, even if it is linked to valuation in fiat, may let some businesses keep some of their income in bitcoins, especially for immediate expenses. In an optimistic scenario, this and other factors could result in a relatively stable value which would help some businesses switch to Bitcoin for all regular operation.
This process would definitely take years, if it ever happens, but prices would still be swayed by greater fiat economies. In time, maybe decades, this could turn around.
My further speculation would be that intervals would be similar to the time it took for Euro to be established, so my optimistic scenario shouldn't be very pessimistic. Until then, Bitcoin's value would mostly be influenced by investors.
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:08:17


If anything a random authority says would be this important, why did you think Bitcoin had any chance to succeed in the first place? Actually, how they are treating it in general is immensely better than what everyone had anticipated a few years ago.
If this is about people who insist on complying, I'm guessing services like Coinbase will implement automated tax calculation, which would work with near zero effort as long as you do all your Bitcoin trade and processing through them. Would help these services gain more loyal users.
Also, USA is the only country that makes tax enforcement such a big deal. They are being a pain in everyone's ass on this planet with their obsession about money laundering by anyone and tax evasion by their own citizens, but I don't see their paranoia of the latter infecting other countries any time soon.
In addition, less usage of Bitcoin as a currency would be a problem, but more speculation may not be. Heterogeneous speculation is actually good for stability.

One important thing to point out is, this "validation" thing is done by all nodes, not just miners. And there are no "vote"s; if a block is invalid, it is invalid and any ordinary node will drop it instantly. Even if you did have more nodes than the rest of the network, all honest nodes will still see only valid blocks.
So mining power is the fundamental concern. If you have more mining power than the rest of the network, then you can likely make a double spend. It's not done by making an invalid block (it will never work), but producing alternative chains of blocks with conflicting transactions and publishing the alternative in a later stage to undo all transactions made in the first chain.

In all these cases there is either a proprietor or copyright holder, which are central entities. It's normal to expect them to want to have control over registries.
From the consumer's perspective however, it is completely different. For instance, when I'm done with a video game, I would like to be able to give it to a friend. With the current systems, I'm not even able to transfer a mobile app I purchased between my personal accounts. It is just stupid and useless.
Bitcoin is so tailor-made to solve this that I think it is very likely to be widely utilized for this purpose.
How it should work:
* The media item can be conceptually identical to the token. Nobody worries about account details associated with a specific content. Just beam the token and the data is automatically downloaded/streamed at the destination.
Benefit to the consumer:
* Full control over the item you paid for.
* Easier to grasp form of ownership. I can reason about a physical disc and downloaded content in the same manner.
* Standard system for transferring ownership of anything (from streaming video to gym memberships), regardless of brand. (This is a bit too optimistic and would require strong demand from consumers though.)
Benefit to the proprietor:

To be honest, Bitcoin by itself isn't enough to absolutely prevent large scale wars, but removes a vital component of the war economy. World War II could still be possible, but would require more blatantly coercive techniques to maintain itself. In all likelihood, it would be far less popular, the scale would be much smaller, and the outcome could be different. Same goes for at least some of the smaller wars with high casualties being waged by third world powers.
Sun Tzu said:


And therefore:


With the technology of extracting money from the public without explicit consent (the consent is given indirectly by using the State's fiat currency), and the chance to borrow easily by having the likelihood to maintain this ability (in effect borrowing from the future generations), this handicap is removed. It seems to me that the transition happened smoother than we usually believe, as regulations of commodity money have historically been used to relieve this handicap as well. So, regulation of crypto-currencies can still be used for the same goal.
It could also be argued that a Bitcoin fueled economy would function differently, especially changing the relationship between financial institutions, arms industry, the states and the peoples. In such a case, wars would have to be explicitly supported by the people who want them. With lowered barriers of entry to the global markets and homogeneously distributed financial connections, achieving critical mass would be tricky.

For these things, usually a printout from a random wallet or blockchain explorer site works. It doesn't really mean anything, but those who are asking don't usually know what *they* mean either.
However, the easiest way to do it provably would be moving all the money to a single address and signing a clearly written statement with the private key associated. Multiple addresses could work as well, though it's incrementally more confusing to the reader.
I recommend the statement's purpose to be clear so that it can't be used for phishing purposes. For instance a signed message like "this is my address" can be used by a scammer to pretend to own the money on the address.
A more interesting thing to do, assuming you use something like Electrum as a wallet, could be including the Master Public Key in a message signed by the first generated deterministic key. This would prove that you own all the addresses in that wallet. This would remove all privacy though.

You can think of stealth addresses as a way of giving a new address to every payer without any communication or online presence. Their main use is static text (e-mail, static web pages, etc.). For instance you could put your stealth address in your e-book, and the payers won't be able to figure each other out.

All the rhetoric I've seen so far is the "threat of centralization" (can't be fixed by replacing the foundation), infighting (opposite of cartel forming, so it's arguably good) and electing people who are potentially controversial. All controversy I've seen so far has been initiated from within the community, I'm eagerly waiting for the mainstream media to "paint Bitcoin with the same brush" as these alleged bad bad people.
I think the foundation is benign, and they don't have a lot of influence over Bitcoin or the community at all. They are supposed to communicate with the legislators, organize conferences and other boring stuff which I wouldn't want to do anyway, so I only say godspeed.

Not if you use arbitration. Your examples, Paypal and CC, provide such a service (albeit limited) for fiat currency. There is no inherent consumer protection for fiat, so you are making an unfair comparison.
No one is stopping merchants and consumers from using a service, like bitrated.com, that provide different levels of protection. The core Bitcoin protocol supports these systems, they are not merely an overlay.
Regarding Trezor; I had perceived the original purchases as donations, so it surprises me that people are complaining. That's how crowdsourcing works, really. Not all startups take off. Almost none of them deliver in time. Furthermore, I think Trezor will eventually deliver, and will be a success.

I have only once tried to do a chargeback with a credit card in my life, and failed. It's not an ultimate measure by a large margin, and certainly worse than a specifically assigned professional arbitrator.
Furthermore, I personally don't want to be protected at all, and certainly won't be if I make a direct donation.

They are not altruistic, but they are not a syndicate either.
What you propose is equivalent to global tomato producers deciding to charge extravagant amounts for it. First thing you are missing is competition, which always drives prices down, and I don't see why mining should be an exception. Second thing you are missing is, people don't really need to eat tomatoes, so it is in the tomato producers' best interest to keep people interested. Basically, individual miners will try to include as many paying transactions as they can.
Does it mean that the fees will constantly go lower? Hardly, since there are two aspects of this.
One is obviously block size, which I think should be made adaptive. With gradually increasing limits, we will have two different variables relevant to adoption (scarcity of the supply, and scarcity of capacity), which is bad.
Second is demand of security. If block reward becomes negligible, but number of transactions don't increase dramatically, people might prefer to pay higher fees to keep the level of security high. This will inevitably be the case if the block size stays at 1M, too, but that almost certainly means dominion of off-chain or side-chain transactions, which is a completely different topic.
In summary, it is not very likely to end up with too high fees, but as you said it's not a done deal.

If there was a secure way to identify the miners, then a "50% limit" or something similar could be built into the protocol.
So to clarify for the OP, from the network's perspective, pools look like any other ordinary miner. And within the Bitcoin protocol, there is no way to associate the blocks with whoever produced them or where the mining power came from. You could play cat and mouse, but since financial security is at stake, it's better to accept this as a theoretical principle, unless you begin *licensing* miners.

Anarcho-capitalism is overwhelmingly American, but it doesn't mean that it won't appeal to other anarchists around the globe.

I think the problem is not the anarchistic ideas shared in this sub, but the black and white attitude of some so-called libertarians. They need to rid themselves of the idea that their point of view is somewhat natural and therefore right. It's a fallacy that usually religious people resort to.

Bitcoin surely didn't bring about those, they have been around for quite a while.
Also the idea of blockchain and the idea of Bitcoin are pretty much indistinguishable (surely you aren't talking about storing data in blocks).
Bottomline is, the technology behind Bitcoin, which is being praised, is Bitcoin.
Now, you can try to remove the currency from the "technology", but what you will have is still the same technology, which is a decentralized notarization system. A concept which by itself necessarily allows creation of decentralized currency.
Furthermore, being agnostic to social or political restraints is the strongest justification for decentralization, and in turn decentralization is the sole justification of every component of this technology. So I would argue that it will have to allow pseudonymous decentralized currencies, which Bitcoin is.
That's why I don't see a nuance that separates what is supposedly being proposed with what already exists.

I fear that this sort of security advice might cause false sense of security. It's better to have people who can reason about security than magical solutions.
In this particular case, malware could accumulate the keys, but spend them with some delay, and not spend small amounts at all. Also, since most encrypted wallets have at least clear public keys, it can actively check for such wallets, or stay dormant for an interval and see if there is any other wallet activity, even without decryption. This would help it determine the amount of delay until the spend, or decide not to spend at all if the potential reward is high.
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:30:53
Since others have explained the public/private key concepts, I guess I can get to the more confusing stuff...
Bitcoin addresses are actually small programs (or more commonly, representation of small programs, since they are hashed). When you send bitcoins to an address, what you are doing is locking the said coins with that program.
To be able to spend the coins sent to that address, one should be able to provide the data that is necessary to make the program run successfully. That data is usually a digital signature that is derived from keys, which are supposed to be kept secret by the parties responsible for the coins.
Very simple addresses that let anyone spend the coins, or very complex ones who define mathematical puzzles but don't really require keys at all, are possible. However, vast majority of such programs are not accepted as "standard" and not relayed by the network. Also, the programming language itself is purposefully limited.

If you are able to find an over-the-counter buyer (e.g. on IRC, Reddit, bitcointalk), they can initiate the transfer through bitrated.com so that both parties will be protected by an arbitrator, without having to trust their capacity to hold the coins. Write the agreement so that the you can prove that the LTC transfer took place. If both parties are honest, the arbitrator will not have to step in at all.

Since pools aren't atomic entities, I don't think we can use them as subjects here. If they are acknowledged as a threat, it's in the miners' best interest to adopt a protocol that lets them observe the transactions confirmed and even let them create the block itself. This doesn't require a change in Bitcoin protocol. The reason this is not the current norm even though the [specification]( "arguably" is not the problem is because miners don't demand it. They find it far more easy to switch pools when push comes to shove, and there are plenty of pools out there.
Also, if Bitcoin would go "bust" just because of this, there are things we can do to make pooled mining impossible. I don't think it would ever come to that though.
Regarding mining itself, you have to make too many assumptions for my taste to call it a natural monopoly.
Just as an example, heat concentration is a negative, and its cost grows nonlinearly with scale. You don't need any extra cooling system if you are running a couple of miners at home, and even make use of the heat (especially ideal if someone invents a water heater). And the additional risk has been demonstrated by the unfortunate fire today, destroying millions of dollars worth of equipment.
Other examples include regulatory risk and the fact that electricity prices do not necessarily correlate with logistical cost.
All in all, I think this deserves extensive study. Simplified assumptions don't work very well with technologies that are developing.

Well, I don't call myself a philanthropist just because I keep the streets clean.
Besides, I'm guessing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of mining equipment can in fact mine on p2pool with satisfactory variance and the owner could spend a few hours to set up merged mining.
However, even though I'm not sure whether it's "perfectly rational", it kind of makes sense for smaller miners to join a pool with low variance. Also, considering the demographic, it is normal to expect these miners to demand a top-down solution.
Will they move to p2pool because it is made a bit more easier? Seeing all the foot dragging lately, I'm not really that convinced.

We are still using the same hard limit for years, and that arbitrary limit was put there to be lifted by a better regime than a constant limit.
We haven't tried any of the proposed upgrades yet, isn't it a bit too early to make that judgment?
There is a while before we get close to the limit. Let's hope the issue will be solved by then. Most of the proposed solutions work for me, really.
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:06:10
Unless there is an alternative that scales better, it's impossible to make a sound judgment.
Tens of TPS can be viable, for instance, for a decentralized name registry. Certainly not to operate a global financial system. Yet viable as a backbone for a global financial system. Not all transactions are important enough to be preserved indefinitely.
So we need to define the goals in order to determine whether it is or can be successful. Do we want it to run an entire economy in 10 years? 20? How many nodes is enough to call it decentralized? Is it still a solution as a mere backbone? What are the complementing technologies? Do they really need a truly decentralized backbone?
My personal take on these questions make me optimistic about Bitcoin. Maybe like you, I have also been pondering about digital scarcity for a long time, and I had dismissed Bitcoin first time I read about it, probably because it wasn't the thing I was convinced that will work -- a bit unorthodox maybe. You have correctly identified scaling as the greatest issue. Maybe we differ on the point of whether it needs to scale well in order to establish an authoritative ledger. Furthermore, something like OpenTransactions is likely better suited for micro-transactions and the like.
Another point that worried me about your comment is, if Bitcoin is so bad, why aren't academics coming up with more workable approaches? If the number of scientific papers on the subject can be considered authoritative, are we to assume that it can't be done?

Turing completeness is a property of the formally defined rules. VM is limiting by cycle here, and since no real implementation of a Turing machine can support infinite execution, I don't see a problem. If you can assume infinite energy for the physical computer, you can also hypothesize based on infinite fees for the Ethereum VM.
It wouldn't be Turing complete if the programming language itself somehow limited computation.
I agree with you in that I don't currently see in what way it will be helpful, since you are likely to depend on outside data anyway. But it may add some flexibility. As you said, there is no harm in trying.
I think the topic that deserves an extended discussion is how these projects can proper funding. If we ignore the dispute about how good an idea Ethereum is, it is still apparent that they wouldn't be able to get enough funding without the greed angle, or some corporate backing, both of which this community dislikes, but doesn't propose a solution.

* When do you think this will be polished enough to be used by Bitcoin-only services?
* Do you think it will ever be used for fiat deposits as well?
* ~~Are colored coins better suited for commodity vouchers? What are the different use-cases? In which cases can they be used together?~~ (EDIT: I guess you can use voting pools on the custody side of colored-coin vouchers.)
* The way I see it, OT would have prevented many hacks and scams if it was widely adopted years ago. What can the community do to help accelerate this process?

Sorry, I deleted my other response because I obviously misunderstood your point.

Yes, that's a good point. Though it's still very hard to make sure they are upheld, and people will continue investing based on gut feeling until we have the technology to guarantee these structures.


Maybe. I think Neo&amp;Bee's plan was vague and risky, but it's impossible to tell whether it was not financially viable. I also don't know how it could be clearer without lying, considering there was no precedent.
I really don't see any proposal here other than stopping investing in companies that are not actively regulated. "Virtual" companies, and companies doing business without explicit laws about how they should be managed are out of question. I don't think this is a good enough solution.

I never said there is no point in calling the business plan into question before investing. I said the situation has nothing to do with the business plan, therefore your argument is pointless. Is there any real indicator that the community didn't consider the business plan?


And, how do you, as an investor or customer, know that this is the case? For instance, do you think the crypto-audits done with the exchanges really guarantee anything?
No, we need to invent more transparent ways of doing business. I'm talking about transparent autonomous money flows, multi-signature custody, etc.
It's quite tragic actually, because Neo would be the first business that would use multisig for deposits.


I commend you for the work you've done to clear your name, but it's still a giant leap to look down on people because they have trusted another public figure. No, I don't think the business plan betrayed any potential fraud.


This is the only point I would agree with, but it seems to me that this sort of judgment is only possible in hindsight. A professionally prepared "complete" business plan doesn't really mean much if the CEO is a fraudster, and the lack of it doesn't really indicate clear incompetence, considering the space itself is being explored the first time.
**tl;dr** I don't think this is enough to accuse the investors with naivety.

Without value, it's not really possible to at least pay miners for the work provided, without some sort of centralization. You cannot switch to something like "Proof of Stake" without value either.
This is just one of the many things those new to the concept have a hard time grasping. A useful mental experiment is going back to 15 years ago or more, asking yourself how you would solve these problems and checking why the other approaches failed. It is trivial to recognize the merits of Bitcoin for those who had pondered about these before it existed.
Incentives are important for something like Bitcoin to work. Actually the same incentives would be helpful for a lot of other things, so we'll see Bitcoin being used for things like anonymizing networks, mesh networks, storage networks and whatnot. Once it's already established, I suspect it will power a lot of things we use in ordinary life without us even noticing.

A malicious entity trying to take over a pool would likely turn out to be "a good thing", as the damage would be minimal and it will be a wake up call for us all.

I'll try to be concise.
My most fundamental objections would be; Forest is no more abstract than Tree, and ownership is not well defined.
Also, I'm not even a firm believer in the idea that there are particular laws of physics, so I'm not inclined to accept a natural law for human society, and I don't see humans as independent and atomic.
Regarding whether yours is a false dichotomy; a person is both free, and is an extension of diverse categories of norms, and either way in constant formation and never unitary. It is as abstract as society. So, maybe contrary to your perspective, I see the State as a projection of the idea of unity and control within the person.
From this point of view, I see components of statism in both capitalist and communist anarchist rhetorics. Anarchism to me represents freedom from all of these constraints, including the collective good, but also ownership, even self-ownership. However we, as the modern society (yes, there is no way out of accepting that we are nurtured by the structures that make it), are just beginning to develop grounds to practically re-explore this area.
Going back to topic, the fact that the Bitcoin community is moving on despite constantly shooting itself in the foot shows me that it is miles ahead of any contemporary anarchist movement, which don't even begin to shoot anywhere. Anarcho-capitalism might not be perfectly flat with its dependence on property rights, but it's flat enough to lead our minds to liberation. Anarchism should not be about resisting compromise and avoiding gray areas, but quite the opposite. If it were up to me, I would remove all contrast from the anarchist flags. Leave imagining absolutes to the statists.

I guess it depends on the advancement. Almost everything I can think of can be slowly incorporated into Bitcoin through a gradual consensus process as long as stake holders can agree on the change and it is an architectural challenge that is justified by the total stored value. The end result would not be Bitcoin (just as the Bitcoin we use isn't the original Bitcoin), but the store of value would be carried on.
Of course, this is no absolute. You won't be able to change economic parameters, etc., and the stake holders as a whole could make the wrong architectural decision when faced with too many unknowns.

In order for blockchain.info to not be able to access the keys, they need to be decrypted locally. I haven't checked myself, but that means sending a hash of the passphrase to the server for login and using the real one for local decryption, assuming the user hasn't activated the secondary passphrase feature.
If this is the case, sniffing wouldn't allow the attacker to log-in at a later time and transfer the coins.

This assumes that there is some algorithm that won't benefit from specialization of hardware. I don't think such a thing exists, and Litecoin already proved that.


That's true for everyone else, and this is the main problem with this idea.


A lot of people seem to think this is the case, but I don't understand why it would be so. Furthermore, there will eventually be ASICs, or at least very specialized hardware (cheaper than consumer stuff, more easily parallelizable, etc.) for every algorithm. You actually want people to develop and distribute these, because otherwise the network will be prone to attacks from parties who have the means to develop them.
Changing the set of algorithms frequently might solve some of these issues, but it pretty much means centralized control much worse than the miners can ever achieve.
I like the proposals that involve proof-of-stake because it radically changes the profile of people involved in block generation.

If by that you mean we don't know what the optimal duration is for a stable "globally used" network, then yes. Faster is good, but I'm pretty convinced that 1 minute blocks cannot made to scale without getting rid of the chain approach. 10 minutes is a decent amount of time, but it might still be too low if we want this to scale.
However, if 1 minute were actually better, then messing around with the protocol would just be necessary. It's not an enormous undertaking anyway. Most of the problem would be achieving community consensus on how block rewards are affected.
@_date: 2014-04-23 09:09:13
It's a good list of issues to think about, but I don't agree with the conclusion. :-)
However, the main theme seems to be that we don't wake up until something bad happens. Maybe the community trusts the incentives that are in place a bit too much. Even though they help a lot, we shouldn't forget that most of the system depends on the effort of honest volunteers. Even if we think that the supporters are incentivized by their stake in the currency, we are still vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons to a degree.


Pools have a very weak sort of control. Eliminating single points of failure is always desirable and I think this should have been resolved long ago with solutions like getblocktemplate (looks like we need to get attacked at least once in order for this to happen), but I wouldn't call it extremely dangerous.


Not so important / no good way to fix. If they screw up, there are alternatives. The only problem is the domain names, and there is no way around it anyway.


Is it in comparison to other opensource projects? I would be skeptical about that. Either way, having multiple different *widespread* implementations is the way to go, but this won't happen until we get out of beta.


I think it will continue to decrease as running them requires more resources. This is a good reminder though, thanks. I will begin running a second continuous full node.


Didn't get this sentence, but overall distribution is better than I expected.


Is separating deposit taking institutions and exchanges possible? That would help with both the problems of manipulation and theft.

No, the coins are sent to a locked output on one side and appear on the other side.
When you want them back, you send them to a locked output on the other side and they get unlocked on this side.
You need to wait for a predefined period for the coins to appear in both cases.
This kind of lock (SPV-lock) is newly invented, and will require a minor change in Bitcoin's implementation.

Yes, total power consumption of mining is roughly correlated with the value of the per interval minted volume plus transaction fees, and not the market cap. Since Bitcoin's popularity seems to increase faster than the mining reward decrease, I predict that the power consumption will go way up, though probably still won't be comparable to other items.
In the long term though, since the fees will surpass mining reward, the feedback loop should actually lead the power consumption to converge to what the security needs of the network dictates.
While it is not expected affect mining too much, when number of transactions increase, the power consumption for full nodes will go up. It is likely to remain negligible compared to mining, though.

Bitcoin isn't "backed by" computational power. It's basically like fiat, it's backed by the belief that others will continue using it. It is far superior than any other currency, so many people think it will replace fiat currencies to a great extent.

Ah, my question was, will Blockstream be ever in "absolute" control of the sidechain(s) they develop?
Assuming that no one will ever peg coins to a closed source chain, there should be a limit to what the developers of a sidechain can change in their own protocol. If they lose users' trust, another team would likely take over. At least this was why historian's outline didn't seem convincing to me.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:07:03
If there is a good enough "technical" feature, I find it likely that Bitcoin will be able to adopt it. Hard forks (changes that break the network's compatibility with older software) are indeed a very big deal, but I expect these changes to take years to decide anyway. In theory, altcoins help this process by testing out new functionality, but I've yet to see a readily implemented feature I'd want to see in Bitcoin. Privacy enhancing ones would be my first candidates when they are deemed good enough.
If they work, sidechains (alternative networks that can use Bitcoin's money supply) can be used to implement some features that are not really very backwards compatible with Bitcoin transactions. They can also be used to test some slightly different economic models that would be impossible to achieve consensus for in Bitcoin.
One abstract category is radically different economic models (I currently can't think of) that can't be implemented satisfactorily as a sidechain. Something like this will have a chance replace Bitcoin, and I don't see a problem with it.
Another scenario is something in Bitcoin suddenly breaking. I think the community has demonstrated that it can recover from software bugs, but what if a weakness in the signing algorithm is discovered? While I don't expect an immediately failing fundamental component, unheard of things happen. Current options are still limited to an immediate hard fork, which would cause a lot of disruption. Sidechains might help with this as well. This is also a reason to have altcoins, maybe not a clone like Litecoin, but radically different ones that have replaced many/all components of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:37:26
Well, at the worst case, you can export the private keys and load them to a local wallet.
However this seems like a blockchain.info issue. I'd take it up with them first. If you are really worried, take an encrypted backup of the wallet, from which you can recover the keys if push comes to shove.
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:20:11
Bitcoin works with transactions, not accounts. At no part of the protocol there is an "address balance". Furthermore, addresses are keys, and sometimes more complex programs, that a transaction itself defines as an unlocking mechanism. So both practically and conceptually the "balance" resides in the transactions, not addresses.
On the other hand, all unspent transactions that can be spent using the mechanism that is associated with the address (which is usually a simple digital signature) can be calculated, as some wallets do. This could be useful, for instance, to calculate the sum of transactions to, minus sum of transactions spent with, a static public donation address.
I don't know if I can call address, coin, mining, etc. misnomers, since there is not a perfect match for what is meant. However, they are misleading in various ways.
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:28:45
This should go in your ToS.
If you do convert the sum to fiat currency, it is OK to make the refund back with the same value (i.e. more BTC if exchange rate goes down, less if it goes up). It is also OK to refund the same amount of BTC, or even a predefined percentage of both.
As long as it is stated in advance, it's fine.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:57:38
Individual developers could of course favor their SC, but users also have a financial incentive to protect the chain they prefer. Even if a majority migration to a different node software doesn't happen, they could always clone the SC and move the coins there.
I might be missing some social aspect of the matter though. Maybe there just isn't enough developers, or some cartel behavior among these companies has a power to affect community judgment. Other than that, competition should favor the actual user.
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:06:02
Formal human organizations (i.e. the type that have bylaws or "laws") are conceptually programs. That not only covers private organizations, but also state institutions.
These "programs" require trust, since the governing bodies are centralized. An external power is necessary to enforce these laws, which is costly, usually opaque and prone to corruption. Also in the case of state institutions, it becomes a bit tricky.
By running these "programs" in a manner which can be checked and validated by random volunteers across the globe, and therefore making it impossible to cheat, these problems are removed from the equation. Now you can have laws that don't need a judge to interpret or coercive power to enforce (though in effect the restrictions are limited to economic means; you can't prevent murder using the block chain).

Reducing the hassle would certainly increase donations. I donated through SEPA, and even that was outside my ordinary limits for considering to make a donation (find an office that accepts it, translate the site, log in to bank, enter a scheduled payment because bank is not open, etc.). I regularly donate with bitcoins and it takes me seconds. If I had to go through the ordeal of exchanging them first, I probably wouldn't have done it.
For this particular case, you may be right though. It is an emergency situation and our personal comfort shouldn't get in the way. For the long term, I would love to see the Bitcoin option, and I bet we will.

Scammers got a free pass and kept the money since there was no means left for the investors (remember, GLBSE was supposed to reveal identity information to harmed parties, but in the end just didn't), some who didn't intend to scam prior to the event just kept the investors' money because of the complete lack of transparency (we still don't know which companies got their money back and there is no way to know), some companies didn't receive a shareholders list at all and kept the money anyway (I don't know what else they could do though) and legit companies lost a lot of time and some weren't paid back in full.

If the atrocities committed are bad enough and can't be contained, a politician and two will be voted out as a just punishment. This way, the public will also have cleaned themselves of the blood and future disasters caused. The cycle continues.
Actually, soldiers, just like their superiors, and just like the people who congratulate them for their service, are a group of murderers. If you don't like calling it clinical sociopathy for technical reasons, call it mass hysteria.

That's a reasonable assumption. However, that is exactly the argument, isn't it? Technology can prohibit bad behavior without explicit enforcement.
I don't know about Coinbase, and to be frank I find the solution too centralized, but Bitcoin allows technologies that let you store your money safely and securely without any government oversight.
It also allows consumer protection through entities that don't require custodial control of funds, where user has a choice on who to trust as an arbitrator in case of disputes.
If the government does enter into a free arbitration market as a competitor to these, there is nothing wrong with it. Just issue licenses, and let the consumer decide whether it is necessary. As long as these actors aren't subsidized, it is a perfect way for the government to present solutions to the public.
Same goes for custodial accounts. They are a huge problem in the Bitcoin environment because it is not regulated by governmental authorities, but entrepreneurship doesn't function optimally because of the fear of future regulation. Best way to do it would be issuing licenses, and letting unlicensed or privately licensed entities operate as well. Let the licensed entities wear the badge of honor publicly instead of leaving consumers who want government protection in limbo.

For larger transactions to skew the results, the "required" fee would need to be non-linear, though I don't know why it would be so. Also, things like accidentally paid high fees could have an effect.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:06:51
I don't think this fixes anything, since a farm can still amass all the set and have the same advantage. This is because the requirement of algorithms affect all the miners the same way, so the profile will not change.
If I have a farm, instead of x amount of SHA-256 miners, I will get x/n amount of each, and my resulting block generation rate will remain the same compared to the rest of the network.
Actually I think it is worse, because this will be less appealing for the casual miner. Larger farms can deal with these sort of tricks more easily.
In addition to the above, this doesn't affects the pools at all.
A more interesting trick could be alternating between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. This would change the profile of mining entities and make the pools irrelevant for every other block. To attack such a network, you would need both a huge amount of coins, and more than half the network's hashrate.

People often use paper and human brain to store their Electrum seeds. You can use all options combined anyway.
The important matter is, signing transactions offline is far more secure, and paper wallet users tend to use online computers to create transactions. If you already have an offline setup (Armory, Electrum, etc.), paper wallets begin looking like a redundant step, since they are more awkward to manage.

It's hard to find a distinctive but conventional term for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is "virtual" but no more virtual than any other currency, maybe except hard assets that may in theory be used as currency. It is also digital, but no more digital than fiat currencies of the non-primitive world. And Warcraft dollars are certainly digital as well.
Bitcoin is both digital and decentralized, which makes it different than hard assets and fiat currency. The term crypto-currency doesn't in itself reflect either of these properties, but it's a made up term, and that's how language functions.
So I would either prefix "decentralized digital" or "crypto-" to currency/money/cash depending on context.

@_date: 2014-10-22 11:45:52
Bitcoin can work between different remittance companies though, so I think it is more versatile. The typical Bitcoin user and an "indirect" user who pegs the value to another asset can transact without a problem, and both can transact with a non-user as long as there is a local exchange or remittance company.
AFAICT, colored coins requires a different setup, as all who process it needs a trust relation with the issuer.

Keep in mind that cost per transaction goes down as number of transactions rise. There is no direct correlation between the required processing power and transaction data or the amount of it.
This scheme may increase storage costs, i.e. running a full node, but that's unrelated to fees or mining reward, at least currently. Yes, I would agree that blockchain bloat is a downside, and running such a thing over a sidechain (when they are available) might be a better idea.


Some companies are doing such a thing, and that's fine. However, securing these systems is a hassle and they fail all the time. I think the increased security and convenience is totally worth it.
I think the ultimate goal is building a system that can run programs that do transactions in a decentralized way. I don't know if colored coins is the best approach, but I think we need to consider the possibility and give it a chance. When we have that, you would at least be able to trust the programmable portion of the bylaws without having to trust anyone else, and these organizations will be able to fund themselves by themselves.

Basically local p2pool nodes are more efficient, building one is really easy and there are pretty much no drawbacks. So no one serious will, nor should use someone else's p2pool node. That's the whole idea behind p2pool anyway.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:25:16
The claimed problem with p2pool is, you require a full node to run it. Alternative solutions would also require a system to verify or create blocks, which currently means running a full node.
Changing the blockchain structure might solve the issue once and for all, but I don't see such a change getting implemented anytime soon.
Maybe we need a "worse" solution. Pools could list multiple different blocks, provided and signed by other third party sources. This doesn't eliminate trust from the equation, but helps distribute it more evenly without too much additional overhead or a hierarchy. Miners can cycle between sources they whitelist by signature and automatically switch pools if the options are reduced below a minimum.
Of course, the pool still gets to select the sources. A more generic protocol could enable miners to go directly to these sources and request work that is custom generated for the preferred pool. These full nodes may include a fee for themselves (part of the block reward) to support their operation, though the pool will still dictate the maximum in this case. The fee is even more justified if work is directly distributed by these full nodes.
I haven't given it much thought, but maybe a solution similar to this can also be implemented in conjunction with getblocktemplate.

Can you expand on what you mean by that?
I really didn't dig deep into Ethereum, but it looks like they are working on a Turing-complete virtual machine. I have developed a similar VM a long while ago, even with the same property of halting based on computational steps. It's hard to do dependably and securely, but not an impossible task.
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:59:31


The currency and the protocol share the same name. I'm guessing this will change naturally in the near future.


The protocol is basically a worldwide notary without a central authority.
A coherent public ledger is quite sufficient to create a payment system for a free currency (i.e. decoupled from outside entities), and we have "Bitcoin the crypto-currency" that works this way using the protocol.
Other basic applications include many functions of a notary, such as acting as a witness (e.g. for copyrighting purposes), and a digital signing system (e.g. proving you control some digital identity, property etc.).
An interesting feature of the system is, the "Bitcoin addresses" we use are actually little programs that describe how the transactions to that "address" can be spent. For instance, you can create a simple program that says "any two signatures of these three signatories are sufficient" and turn it into a Bitcoin address. Any money sent to that address will then require at least two of the specified three people to sign it to be freed.
The above feature is being used to make very simple contracts for things like dispute-mediation. The programming language to write these programs are purposefully limited, but it will allow more stuff in the future.
Combining all these, transferable proof of ownership that can be traded with little or no trust is quite possible, but these require outside help depending on the domain. For instance, a futuristic car that requires a digital signature to function can be traded easily (e.g. between two smartphones), assuming such a car exists and is properly secured. Another use case is company shares or even separate currencies that are traded on the Bitcoin network.
Since the system itself doesn't depend on outside elements that much, it is very versatile. For instance, it's not too complicated to devise a system that will transfer your wealth to several people in the case of you becoming incapacitated. In the near future, we will have rapidly adjusted micropayments, which could be useful for sharing resources without a central intermediary. So on and so forth...
However, this doesn't mean that we can abandon notaries, accountants and bankers right away, as this system requires a lot of outside structure to reach its full potential, and there are countless real-life problems that need to be solved before that happens.
One thing of note is, the whole project, including the core code and protocol are open. This allows parallel projects that experiment on things like a more lax programming language. TODO: explain the alt-coin and side-chain concepts. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:01:45

Briefly, I think people should understand that this is the Internet and should not make decisions without gaining some insight of their own. But...


Here we go again with the imaginary camps.


Same problem. Without debate happening, and arguments being in the open, it doesn't mean anything. For all I know, those might be the exact same people, pumping and dumping. Some percentage of them certainly are.
People yelling "to the moooon" are as inevitable as disappointed trolls who call doom on every downturn. That doesn't mean either is a majority group by number.
If you are claiming that dumb naysayers have been better at their predictions than dumb pumpers, I think you may be a bit biased. I've been following Bitcoin for the last 4 years, and empty detraction has been eventually blown into pieces. But imagine you listened to that idiot who said Bitcoin held promise in 2010, 2011, 2012 or 2013... Doesn't tell anything about the future, but the past is out in the open.
Judging by your comments (e.g. "nearly guaranteed that a new reader is going to lose money", "brief period in 2013", "the only businesses that have not scammed you guys"), you seem to be disillusioned about the exchange rate decline during 2014. But there were enough people calling people to sanity here, even though they are not the most vocal group. No, they were not all classified as trolls, and certainly not the trolls OP is talking about.


So this is why you want to lump all Bitcoiners in the same pile... You know, there are very good reasons to try to find a way to make things work without regulatory authority. It doesn't mean you will be successful every step of the way, eventual success is enough. That means many failures along the way.

Yes, outside arbitrators can be complicated and unreliable. However, what I was talking about was a 2-of-3 signature mechanism where the arbitrator has no direct control over the deposit. It is not that hard to implement, and the trust requirements decrease dramatically.
In this scheme, you will need to actively conspire with one of the parties to be able to control the money. So it is practically impossible for all the money to disappear. Also, the transactions can still go through even if you completely disappear.
This is very straightforward and many of the newer generation systems seem to adopt this or a similar contract regime. If you have any reason not to have implemented the system, I would love to learn about it.

Why is that? If you are not booting from a clean read-only medium for off-line operation, I don't see any reason to restore from seed every time. If it's not intentional, then your Electrum installation is broken.
Also, Electrum can supply you with an infinite number of "receiving addresses". Just check the "Receive" tab and you will likely see the address.
If not, it is likely that you entered the wrong seed the first time and got a different address. You might want to try combinations.
Another possibility is that your machine is compromised, but given the scenario, I think it's one of the above.

Copying a snapshot of a current state of the ledger is not a very attractive idea. As you get them for free and can sell them off, it is sort of a bonus for Bitcoin holders with no benefit to anyone else.

I think it's quite the contrary. Regulations give bigger companies more advantages over smaller ones.
Do you have an idea that would make banking better and reduce the risk on the society, which is not being implemented by the bigger banks because it will reduce their profits? I'm sure I can think of some. Now, let's implement it. Can you even imagine you can get into the banking business, purely from the regulatory perspective, let alone dare compete with them?
It's even worse with banks than any other corporation. First off, there are specific regulations that give banks exclusive rights. Second, banking doesn't inherently benefit from scale. For instance, if you don't have huge amount of regulations regarding money transfers, international banks will not have an edge in this area. So on and so forth. Scale would still be an important factor, but not as it is now.
As a counter example, big insurance companies could exist even with less regulation, as they benefit more from scale.
I think the bottomline is, banking would be perceived more risky by the consumer, and they would have to be more vigilant. They would be more aware of the risks and would not so easily delegate diversification. This alone would remove a large portion of the accumulated risk that regularly causes economic collapse.

No. I think it's a better model too, but unfortunately people prefer to stay within the browser, or at least that's the apparent perception.
I think Bitrated, or similar approaches, are a big enough improvement over naive escrow services, and we should begin using them. There are an increasing number of people who whine about lack of solutions and only a constant number of people who take the initiative. So, the best place to begin would be merchants integrating such solutions.
If they prove useful, other clients, like wallet plug-ins can be developed.

There aren't many ways around it. ATM's, localbitcoins and Mycelium app are there, but the fact is if monetary transactions were that convenient, we wouldn't need Bitcoin to begin with.
Bitcoin's case is chicken and egg all around. Best way to get bits is to earn them. It is actually not a bad option, now that you can use it for a decent amount of your expenditures. But for people to be in a comfortable position to easily earn coins, it has to be accepted to some degree by consumers.

I don't have a membership, so I didn't see how it works, but if it is as advertised, it would practically be a credit card to cash conversion service. So it is my assumption. For instance if the "raining cash" is actually fake notes (IOU), then it's not a problem. Also, this doesn't apply to other services, for which I'm sure they accept credit cards.
Simply put, the payer's bank can initiate a chargeback (complaint, report of theft, etc.) and the club will have to take the loss as they don't pass on the credit. Assuming you are even allowed to offer such a service through credit card.
In general, the risk is different from service to service. Some can just terminate service (e.g. hosting), some can absorb the loss directly (non-scarce digital products, services that are practically scams, etc.), some reflect it in their pricing, some can deal with complicated disputes and others have the ability to win disputes easily using, say, delivery confirmation. If none of these works for their business type, they usually do a prior background check or a verification transaction, which usually takes days. This is far from uncommon.
Quite recently, some services that fit the last category began accepting Bitcoin, and it is very relieving on the customer side as well. While you lose the ability to initiate a chargeback, you get instant access and some percentage discount in return. It's a trade-off, and it's especially helpful to have the option if you trust the company.
As a disclaimer, I'm not an expert, just a consumer who have used all these options in the past. But OP seems to me as a very obvious use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:15:18

I honestly don't get what you are proposing. The only difference seems to be that you think people need to abide by a single set of rules that are developed by "the people", somehow in a manner that the majority doesn't dominate minorities. How does that happen?
I guess the **tl;dr** of my argument is, the essence of the open-source model is the ability to fork.
To be honest, the only thing saving me from being saved by my neighbors from the fire of hell is the fact that they believe in the social hierarchies. They are all nice people, but saving people from hell is also a nice thing to do. I seriously don't know how to fix these divides through rigorous debate.
As I explained, what I'm talking about is not a voting system, but an approach to apply policies with minimal coercion. (Actually neither voting, nor policy does really reflect the essence, though I guess we'll have to work with those words.) As opting in is completely voluntary, how these policies are developed are less of a problem.
Of course, for this to work, everyone still needs to believe in something, even though minimal. But unlike direct democracy, they can then build their own competing policies and abide by whichever one they choose.

Actually, if you haven't explicitly activated incoming RPC connections from the outside and explicitly enabled SSL, you don't need to worry. I don't think anyone keeps actual coins on such nodes, so everyone should be safe.
EDIT: OK, "everyone" is a rough generalization. :-) I imagine some people might be accessing their Bitcoin nodes from the outside over SSL secured RPC, instead of, say, over an SSH connection. These people might really think of moving their coins (to brand new keys, not keys from the pool).

I understand and partially agree with your general viewpoint, but I think you are purposefully superficial because of your biases. It is even likely that you are calling them whores because *they* are the honest ones.
I was raised around people who think women who wear make-up are whores. Literal, whores. And it actually makes sense, doesn't it. All of the aesthetics involved with it have something to do with sexuality. After all, it is about being someone else's eye candy, as you said.
Actually, I agree with this. But then again, I have a considerably higher respect for whores than you, too. I accept that my wife is at least partially a whore, since she has to be "presentable" to other men and women in order to be successful at work. The bitch is in fucking finance.
And what about men that attach a piece of cloth dangling beneath their chin in order to please others? Isn't it purely to announce your submission? I agree, there is nothing sexy about it (until we analyze it at least), but I think it's pretty much in the same category, unless you think there is something holy or divine about "sex".
And none of this has anything to do with nobility.

Most people predicted from the beginning (including satoshi) that eventually both mining and full node operation would be done by professional entities.
I never understood this myth of ASICs being a problem however. I thought it was a Litecoin propaganda thing, but since their once GPU-proof system now has ASICs, I thought this would disappear.
There is no computation task that specialized hardware would not be better at. Even if you somehow did "require" CPU's, there are supercomputers out there, botnets, people with resources to build fast parallel computers, so on and so forth. Bitcoin ASIC techonological progress at least assures us that any attacker will have to make the same investment as any other party.
Our current problem is not ASICs, but something between a painful transition to a different mining economy and the problem with the incentive structure regarding the pools. Former is some parties accumulating a lot of computational power without decent competition. The latter is namely the demand for low variance having been overlooked. I personally thought this would be a non-issue, since the rewards average out in time, but people who invest in mining are also being rational by demanding predictable payouts.
I think the former will be solved through market forces. Instead of sitting here whining, we should form different flavors of mining initiatives all around. Larger companies should be doing so already, but we can't completely depend on them.
Latter is a bigger issue. Can we make it so that sub-blocks can be mined directly for a proportion of the mining reward? I think so, but it would be an immense undertaking. Can we completely get rid of the chain structure and move to a different graph model? Maybe, but that would take many years to say the least.
For the short term though, I think "a better p2pool" is the way to go. Small miners might think that working for smaller pools has the same benefit, but keep in mind that directing your mining power to p2pool decreases its variance too, which helps others want to connect as well.

That's not what a hard fork means. The context is completely different, hence the otherwise meaningless adjective, "hard".
A hard fork happens when the blockchain itself forks. For instance, if a group of people begin running an incompatible version (e.g. non-backwards-compatible code update), they will continue building a different chain based on the common one.
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:06:28
Lucky that mostly testers were using the network back then.
Actually, one could argue that the complete monetary system, including the unit of account, changes after every hard fork. If there wasn't/isn't consensus, you'd have the old coin and new coin in parallel.
But I'm sure you must understand what I'm talking about.
If you think the opensource node software has a specific flaw, you fix it. If you think development principles are not on par with modern methods, you can build your own team. If you think the whole code is garbage, you re-implement it from scratch. All is going on right now.
Let's assume that someone instead did a complete re-implementation, but rather than using Bitcoin's history, bootstrapped from scratch. If it is considerably better (though I don't know how to measure it), Bitcoin users would just adopt the software and use it with their own chain.
To have a reason to switch to a different crypto-currency, there has to be an incompatible feature, and that feature has to result in a preferable system. This will get even less likely if side-chains become successful. Can still happen, but not because of an implementation specific issue.
All of this reminds me of RealSolid's article about how flawed Bitcoin is and how SolidCoin fixed all its problems.

Bitcoin transactions are broadcast and recorded publicly, so the recipient doesn't really need to have a computer.
The most conventional medium you can use to store your key is a "paper wallet". It can be encrypted with a password for protection against theft and copies of the same wallet can be made to increase redundancy.
You need to generate your paper wallet personally on a secure offline computer, which is the only time you will need a computer. Encrypting with a strong password is sometimes recommended, which will also make the situation more flexible (e.g. if you don't have a printer connected to your offline computer, you won't be carrying around your clear keys in a pdf file). Remember to write down the password or a reminder and store it in a location other than the one you store the wallets. Encryption is not a good idea if it is even remotely possible that you will lose your password.
Another important thing to know is how to spend from paper wallets. There are nice mobile apps that make it very easy. If you don't know what you are doing, I would recommend testing the app of your choice with a smaller sum first. So for instance, while creating your 1 BTC paper wallets, maybe you can make some 0.1 or 0.01 ones to make it safer to test in the future.
It's actually easier than it sounds. Don't let others generate the wallets for you.

First problem with these arguments is, there is no average human. There are many that are interested in and capable of X, and maybe many more who aren't.
Which brings up the second problem, the normative nature of such arguments. I distinctly remember being looked down on and ridiculed for suggesting that I can't live without a BBS connection, more than two decades ago now, when the "why" and "how" were not really clear for the "average human". Now, the average human wants and can use the Internet just fine.
A very low percentage of population with initiative is enough to change the remaining percentage.


I sort of agree with the rest of your comment, Bitcoin doesn't automatically fix anything. It's also not all powerful. I see three reasons for becoming a Bitcoin early-ish adopter (or three overlapping groups of people who might have reasons to use it).
One, you want this to succeed in fixing things you want fixed. You start dealing with Bitcoin because you want others to deal with it, so that it becomes more stable, we get rid of unnecessary intermediaries, develop programmable companies that can't cheat, or whatever else your goal is. You think it will be good, so it's worth the risk.
Two, you think some other people will think like the above and plunge in to make profit.
Three, because of the above guys, regardless of their motive, Bitcoin has become a good enough tool for you to benefit from. It is very slowly gaining ground in countries with cruel capital controls, high inflation, untrusted banking systems, etc. It has already been used, and I think still being used to trade illicit items or make payments to parties that are otherwise out of reach because of trade sanctions or some other financial blockade. It is also being used for more ordinary transactions which require anonymity merely on principle (like VPN accounts).
Of course, group two takes advantage of the interest by the third group as well, which is why so many people invest in both Bitcoin the currency and Bitcoin startups.

Obviously exactly the same. Having a stake in Bitcoin is completely voluntary, so if someone didn't believe it to be worth having a stake in, they wouldn't have a stake in it. 
The decision someone makes when holding bitcoins at this moment and someone who decides to buy them for 450 EUR a piece are fundamentally the same.


If it is about never being able to gain anything from it personally, regardless of the exchange rate, I would care somewhat less. I would still support it for the benefit of society, just like I do support other censorship resistant technologies.
I think the actual gain from Bitcoin's success is bringing the barriers of entry down for me and everyone else I might have financial relations with. It allowed me to work with people with whom I would never have such relations before, and that's how I made most of my bitcoins. If I didn't think Bitcoin was a good idea, I wouldn't keep them.

You are comparing completely unrelated types of contract. A lot of people think we should prefer equity over debt so that we can always do such comparisons, precisely because it doesn't magically happen just because bystanders decide so.
If I give you my money for safekeeping for whatever reason, no amount of "risk" involved liberates you from the contract. If you wanted me to share the risk, we could have made a different agreement.
Anyway, assuming that *is* your answer to the question, then you want people to stop going after their money. Why? What's the catch?


The "doing something about it" part is part of the risky action. Say you bought $100 coins from MtGox, and were only able to extract 20%. That would be a net profit. It's the risk taker's business, and they have every right to attempt to enforce the contract. Why are you suggesting that people stop doing so?

I don't agree. It may show that too much noise within a single team can hinder development. If that is the case, then having people with different approaches in different implementations makes more sense than having more people in the core decision mechanism of a single project.
Furthermore, there are many open-source projects that are very critical. A recent example is OpenSSL.


Well, at the very least, it increases reliability. Also, in general, minority groups striving to have more control is better for the network in general, so me doubling the amount of my nodes is actually helpful for decentralization regardless of my motives, as long as it doesn't mean the doubling in power of more influential groups.

I think 2014 and 2015 will be very fruitful with regards to infrastructure development, but I doubt that Bitcoin's exchange rate will rise quickly as some people anticipate.
In the longer run though, looking back, you will realize that what's going on right now was a very natural, organic change that has been shaping the world in a good way, since the pervasion of the Internet. Bitcoin is not part of a world where it has gotten remittances cheaper. It is part of a world where all resilient decentralized technologies come together to form a versatile society where human and machine form a symbiosis and enable diverse foci of will to pursue goals with minimal conflict.

Coin mixing is a method to increase privacy. Since you mentioned anonymity as something separate, you may want to re-consider how Bitcoin transactions work.
So briefly, if your wallet has an incoming transaction that can be identified as some persona, your future transactions may be identified as well (depending on many things). The need for mixing might be as innocent as trying to keep your Twitter and forum identities separate, or wanting to avoid spying of someone you just got coins from, face to face. It could also be for covering your tracks. Many people do it habitually as a simple security precaution.

As others have said, current holders of Bitcoin are effectively paying miners to mine (through inflation of money supply) in the form of the "block reward", which diminishes in time. So it's not really clear how to predict the real energy cost.
Currently, transaction fees constitute about 0.4% of miner income. I think we could somewhat realistically say that the difficulty would be 0.4% of what it is now if there was no block reward, which means the power consumption per block would also be 0.4%.
An increase in fees per block would raise the power consumption, but assuming it is a direct result of an increase in number of transactions, cost per transaction should remain the same. Also an increased exchange rate of Bitcoin loses its effect as the block reward diminishes, since the average fee should also decrease with an increased exchange rate.
Bottom line is, as number of transactions increase and block reward decreases, the power consumption is likely to converge to the user-demanded amount of security.
@_date: 2014-10-23 08:18:33
It's probably miners immediately selling to recover their investments.
I think difficulty will continue to increase as long as it gets you more than the electricity consumed. You can disregard the value of the devices, since they are already produced in excess.
"Advantage to the rich" didn't mean much to me here, as there is a tight margin of profit, and quite many miners are already at a loss. Yes, being able to afford to lose might be a requirement, but it is still not a place you want to be if you are *not* rich. Being in the right place and having right relations would help more than money I presume.
Difficulty correction would probably ease things a little with regards to the effect on Bitcoin exchange rate. However, I think this process of coins moving from weak to strong hands is an essential component of a strong structure. The exchange rate was already too high, and I think we need to bear with it for a year or so more regardless of difficulty. There are many tools lacking in the market that are essential for non-technical people to use Bitcoin.

The sort of manipulation you are describing is unavoidable. But it also is not the whole concern. Assuming they won't be able to sell the idea of "virtual bitcoins" (they will try, really) akin to goxcoin, their manipulative powers will be far too limited compared to what they have in other markets.
Specifically, I don't think the idea of debt will ever work in the Bitcoin economy (and almost all catastrophes we experienced were related to some form of this), which severely hinders the power of accumulation and discretionary redistribution of risk.
This is why it might be a good idea not to keep savings on wallets that require bank-like trust (e.g. coinbase, bitstamp). Unless you have the sole control of your coin, what you are holding is a debt contract.
Also, equity stake instead of loans seem to work well. For instance, no Bitcoin bank gave a loan to Neo&amp;Bee, therefore no unaffiliated party had to pay the price when it exploded. Granted, we need much better measures in place, preferably purely technological, but I think the model is evolving well.

No, I'm telling you that your claim that higher scale organizations need governance is false:


If we are talking about "will", it is obvious to me that its not "located" in individual cells, but the genes. Calling apoptosis a form of totalitarianism is a side effect of defining the will of the cell isolated from the relations between genes and will of the individual genes.
Basically you are making a projection from a concept defined in the context of human social organization to other areas with a cherry picked mapping to meet your agenda.


A "free thinking cell" is your invention, not mine.
As a side note, anarchism is not tightly tied to the idea of "free will". Some anarchist thinkers even don't clearly separate the will of the collective from the will of the individual. Lack of coercion and lack of hierarchy is usually a common theme, but how they see persons and societies vary a lot.

Basically if you can generate your private keys, you have enough information to initiate transactions. For instance you can import these keys into a different wallet software, or treat them as paper wallets and move the money into different addresses. So the online service itself (e.g. Electrum server) is not important.
If Electrum isn't maintained, but you have access to the old source code, it is very likely that you will be able to run it and generate your keys. If you don't have access to the source, or a system that can run the old code, you can still do the calculations to generate the keys (i.e. write/port the program) if you have the specifications.
I'm still able to find games from 18 years ago and actually run them in my computer. Since Electrum and brain wallet specifications are open and data preservation is much easier than 20 years ago, I wouldn't be worried. Keep a copy of the source codes of the tools you have used to ease your mind.

A hash function is any function that reduces a random chunk of data into a fixed sized number, with the desirable property of the result being very sensitive to changes in the input data. This property makes it astronomically difficult to create two different chunks of data that gives the same hash.
Bitcoin uses the tried and tested function called [SHA-256]( to convert blocks of transaction data into numbers (block hash). Miners' job is finding a block hash lower than the network-wide target. To do this, they continuously hash the block while modifying the data slightly (by incrementing an otherwise useless number within the block header).
When a suitable block hash is found (and accepted by the network), two things are certain. First, because of the mentioned property of hash functions, the block hash indisputably identifies the transaction data it is created from. Second, since the probability of finding the number is known, the amount of network-wide computational work put into discovering it can be assumed to converge to the predetermined average.
The idea is, having blocks include a mathematically provable amount of work on them. Since every block references the one before it in its own data structure, transactions that get included in a block become more secure as new blocks are discovered. This way, an attacker that wants to change the history of transactions needs to do at least as much computational work as the blocks carry in total.
Obviously, being "Satoshi" gives no advantage to you whatsoever. I'm not sure if he even has access to any repository that is currently used to program node software. Regardless, current developers don't have any control of the network either.

While decentralized systems are surely more expensive at the technical level, centralized systems tend to become very cumbersome at higher levels, because gatekeepers have the opportunity to profit from access control.

If you have the initial seed phrase, you can always regenerate the wallet from scratch and access your money. That, however, creates another thing you need to keep securely.
I personally memorize my seed phrases, but one can also securely store it using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme or simpler but creative methods.
Regarding security, basically if your computer is compromised, using Coinbase or Electrum will make no difference. With Electrum though, you can store the bulk of your money in an offline wallet, which would make it immensely more secure than online alternatives.

Not really. Your nervous system doesn't have that much control over you, and your conscious thought doesn't have that much control over your nervous system.
A multicellular organism is a collective that works in harmony. There isn't much explicit control going on, and ultimately, "self preservation" cannot be defined at the scale of a cell.
The problem with your perspective is, the singular multicellular organism does not by itself define or describe what's really going on, which is the constant struggle between genes. The scale you need to observe is the totality of the ecosystem, or to increase the possibility of discovery, the totality of the species.
The selfishness of genes create the complicated contracts, which "come to life" as multicellular organisms.

If you can't have money sent to you without giving your identity, you can't remain anonymous. It is obvious, and honestly is not related to the debate at all.
You can receive donations, or get paid for work you've done without sharing your identity details, generate income from investments, etc. in which case the address can't be associated with real life identities. A lot of Bitcoin transactions fit this criteria.
The part that is being discussed is the traceable nature of the public ledger. However, "at best pseudonymous" is a wrong description. There are cryptographic techniques that make it possible to create and redeem untraceable tokens that can be applied to Bitcoin, and the resulting anonymity is much better than traditional "untraceable" digital cash.

You're right, as things change, there may even be other factors we need to consider too. Like increased bandwidth and storage requirements which are going to be reflected to the mining fees (which are currently dwarfed by the processing costs).

Users can run servers, but they don't want to rely on their own servers for availability. I should be able to exist on the social network even if all my nodes are offline. I might even want my plug-ins to function.
Diaspora makes the system more like e-mail. Distributed properly, provides some more privacy, etc. and offers persistence. However, in this day and age, e-mail is very problematic. Your data is out in the open as long as you don't use end-to-end encryption, which no one does.
I think we can totally skip the e-mail step and move directly to Bitmessage. Even further actually, where the user can choose to just connect through a lightweight protocol and let others do the heavy-lifting. I'm sure there will be companies willing to pay for these users in exchange for an advertisement placed on their profile page.

I think you've missed the meaning of my question. I'm not saying experimentation isn't good, but asking for justification from an engineering standpoint.
You don't go and randomly write code. Also, you don't go and use any random program. There are set goals, measures, etc. Saying it doesn't have to justify anything because it's an open field is meaningless. Of course it's open.

Only thin clients.
Basically, to make sure you are connecting to the intended server instead of just talking to an exit node posing as one. Assuming there aren't any other vulnerabilities in the client, the risk is limited to the server lying about transactions or simple harvesting of addresses (somewhat similar to the attacks described in the article, which is why I mentioned it), so it is not nearly as dangerous as connecting to a web-based wallet over clear http.
As an example, Mycelium mobile wallet uses HTTPS, the certificate comes with the software, and you can get the software through a validated source (e.g. google play). So you at least know that you only need to trust their nodes, and they are the only party you expose your addresses/transactions to.

It's a good question.
Having been in countries with high inflation, I think it's easy to get used to spending in thousands or even billions of the unit. It is considerably easier than thinking in decimal places. I think declining prices would be the harder thing to get used to, though likely pleasant.
As for skipping mBTC, I think it's a sensible move. Changing this stuff is getting harder as more people use the currency. Besides, a millionth of a bitcoin and two decimal places fitting the absolute granularity is quite elegant.

Not really. Bitcoin is not backed by energy, or anything else really. We currently don't have the technology of free money that is backed by something. It is even possible that we will get rid of our need of money before that happens. I remember reading attempts at coming at a decent solution by some naive souls at bitcointalk.org to no avail. It's a bigger problem than what Bitcoin has solved.
I imagine, when we have the technology, it might not be "backed" anyway. Backing is necessary when you can't transfer stuff over a distance easily. I'm sure we'll see in a couple of centuries. Until then, there is Bitcoin.

To replace direct insured deposits in the central bank banks need very safe investment vehicles, which means they will purchase tons of government bonds. To fund member states through lower interest bank deposits is probably one of the reasons ECB is doing this. And I am getting slightly anxious about it.
The ordinary consumer is already used to negative "real" interest rates for their deposits, so this new development isn't so hard to grasp. Yet, it's just another action that reminds us that monetary policies are there to control how people behave. IMHO, that reminder is the main reason Bitcoin looks more appealing, and not the minuscule rate changes.

Okay, a few thoughts.
I've been directing a few terahashes to p2pool. You can do the same by renting a rig (e.g. from betarigs.com) and directing the hashing power to an open [p2pool server]( This not only works against larger centralized pools, it decreases variance on p2pool.
Do mining software have protection against 51% attacks? For instance, I think it would be trivial with GBT to detect whether the pool is building a chain fork. Is this possible with Stratum?
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:21:36
It's really tragic that your comment is getting downvoted.
A lucky streak is not a potential 51% attack, and at no point in the streak it is a potential 51% attack. The whole point of 51% is that your unpublished chain is statistically guaranteed to get longer than the main chain, which then you can orphan.
Regarding abandoning proof-of-work, I don't think we have something else that is purely information and non-replicable yet.

Yes, but every time you make a transaction, the remaining amount is moved to a change address. If you use a Bitcoin client that follows the recommendation, you will always be using a different address.
Having said that, if you receive a large chunk and spend it in relatively low amounts, it is possible to guess change addresses. Merging of transactions also makes analysis easier.
All in all, I find OP's story hard to believe, but Bitcoin clients still need to implement some improved logic for privacy.

I didn't mean to sound too confident about Bitcoin's future, just wanted to point out that we should not be short-sighted or limit our focus to the current state of affairs. However, it's an experiment, a movement and a struggle which may very well fail.
I like the future it will bring if it does succeed though. We can't definitively tell whether Bitcoin will change the world, but in order to succeed, it has to. That is not easy, and Bitcoin by itself is not enough.

A Bitcoin transaction takes a bunch of inputs (received transactions) and sends them to a bunch of outputs. You can't spend only a part of a single incoming transaction, it's always fully consumed.
If we take Electrum as an example, the part you haven't sent to an external address is sent back to a newly generated "change address" in your wallet. Therefore the private key your coins are associated with changes after each transaction. If you always use a different address for receiving, there will never be an address re-use.


The way Electrum works, your private keys will never be exposed from the offline machine to the online world. You only transfer the signed transaction, which is immutable (i.e. will become invalid if modified).
However, if you get your seed leak out somehow (e.g. compromised offline machine, stolen piece of paper), ALL your private keys can be generated from it, so the fact that you are not re-using private keys does not matter.


Hope it is clear from the above that in the case of Electrum, as long as your offline wallet remains offline at all times, you won't be opening yourself to additional risk just by making transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:30:23
Here is a tutorial on how to create an offline wallet:
To clarify, you create the wallet completely offline, and that wallet never touches an online machine.
On an online machine, you generate a version of the wallet (using the Master Public Key), which you can use to receive, observe and generate transactions. This wallet doesn't have the capability to make valid transactions.
You carry the unsigned transaction to the off-line machine, sign it there, and carry it back. It can be done with a USB stick, QR-code and camera, etc.
In addition, you don't need to preserve the wallet on the offline machine either, since it can always be generated from the seed, so a read-only device can be used for improved security.
In this scheme, what you have to care about is not losing your seed and not getting it stolen.

I think the idea is to deprive the governments of the power to create value out of nothing. Creation of money may be the most problematic form of revenue for the state, because it requires the lowest amount of interaction with the people. Working against it is not the solution to all problems, but it *is* something.
@_date: 2014-10-18 11:42:04
It wouldn't make Bitcoin illegal, because the Bitcoin protocol doesn't make use of encryption.
Encrypted wallets can't be detected remotely, but I suppose you could also try to protect your keys without encryption. With decent user education, it's doable.
There is also the debate of what constitutes encryption. Technically, Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme is not encryption, and is very effective for protection secrets.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:09:07
Well, I cross-checked a couple of old transactions from the list you mentioned with blockr.io and they were actually confirmed even though blockchain.info claims they are not. It was also apparent from the fact that transactions using their outputs are seen as confirmed on blockchain.info, which shows that the site isn't internally consistent.
If there are any specific oddities you see on that list, I'm very interested in checking them out.
@_date: 2014-10-25 07:20:03
In this case, all I see is the questionable relevancy, since Bitcoin is about bypassing the system *with* a new idea, not shaking the old system in order for the idea to have a chance. If there will ever be a "shaking", it would happen after the fact.
Of course, intended meaning is important, so something other than what the generalization means within context would be ill use. Maybe you can clarify what it is?
However as a general rule, whether they would have supported the thing in question should not matter. If the intended meaning of the generalization supports an idea that they would have disliked, it is their fault to make such a generalization in the first place.

1. If you need the identity of the person you trade with, get it or don't do business.
2. There are solutions to A &amp; B, C &amp; D is similar to cash or gold. Supply decreasing is not an issue, but we can argue whether not knowing how much there is in circulation is a problem. I don't think it is.
3. Botnets aren't a concern. There isn't a lot of harm pools can do, but I agree that humongous mining farms can become a problem.
4. To put it simply, more transactions doesn't mean more work for miners. Newest developments in the protocol will make this even less of a concern. Also, difficulty adjusts to block generation time. There are many things to be done for Bitcoin to scale, though.
5. Actually, I think this item is a bit more worrying (in the long run) than you might think. Bitcoin is open to anyone, so we can't protect it by targeting a particular government without compromising on the ideals. That means more mining power, which isn't exactly green. In the long run, Bitcoin can and should prepare itself by using a more complex validation scheme, probably using wealth and network distribution in addition to computer process.

Capital controls are something else entirely. That would also solve the issue by making everyone poor to begin with.
Yes, the bank was private, but all banks are heavily regulated. These schemes don't come to be without State's involvement. They need lengthy government involvement and explicit sanctions.
To put it in another way, why didn't the "ministries of trade and finance, and the Central Bank" warn the public about the exposure of Cypriot banks the same way they are doing with Bitcoin? The fact is, they are not only responsible as a regulating agency, they were the real architects of the system that resulted in the crisis.

Where does he say that? He is saying that, if the issue is real, it will attract attention. I see issues discussed here. I see issues dealt with in the forums. Pumpers vote, dumpers vote, they cancel each other out. Trolls are a problem though.
Granted, this sub is not the best place to discuss serious issues, but only today I have commented on threads about the centralization trend (multiple issues were raised) and proof-of-stake because I saw them on the front page.


The answer I see here with the highest frequency is, zero confirmation with appropriate fees is acceptable for casual amounts (I've been using Bitcoin for more than 3 years and this approach hasn't failed me so far). Payment protocol and PoS systems will ensure that the transaction is structured correctly for this to work. For higher amounts, you have to wait for confirmation, depending on the risk. This answer might not have satisfied you, and it's OK, but I have seen it at least a hundred times.
A lower frequency answer is, green addresses. Green addresses, combined with with multi-signature is proposed and implemented (e.g. greenaddress.it) as a method for instant transactions without having to transfer control of your money to third parties.
A relatively older answer, which has fallen out of favor but has widespread use nonetheless is using intermediaries. I don't think anyone will advise this anymore, especially after the MtGox incident, but plenty of people seem to be using CoinBase. Another unpopular answer is using a system like Ripple.
One more thing that combines the last two is an OpenTransactions based system, but that has been in the works forever.
I can understand if you say these are confusing, and you're right, but if you still think it's not answered, then you might want to begin with why none of these satisfy your criteria.

Colored coins is about token transfer. It removes the need for centralized exchanges. That's all.
Exchanges are a large part of the equation, so I think this adds a lot.
Many such centralized exchanges shut their doors, and some even failed to pay back people's money or disclose their databases (which then led to companies keeping people's money). Such a trustless token exchange is very welcome to the space, in my opinion.
I think you are expecting a bit too much. Can we remove the need to trust business operators without any active enforcement, lawyers, etc.? Yes, maybe, but that means that the whole business decisions and all money flow should be moved to the decentralized realm as well. I think it will happen at one point, but it's a development on par with cyborgs and space elevators. You have to give it time.

Electrum uses a deterministic wallet, so you can generate the wallet from scratch and access your funds anytime using the seed passphrase, or an old wallet backup. There is no "key pool" or similar limits. You can also synchronize your (encrypted) labels with a server, so you can even get your labels back.
Electrum can also produce a "Master Public Key" for your wallet, which you can use to create a watch-only wallet where you can observe transactions, create new addresses, etc. This sort of wallet can also create transactions, but they have to be signed by the "real" wallet (that you likely keep offline) before being broadcast.


Bitcoin works with transactions, not balances. When you create a transaction, that means you connect multiple input transactions to multiple output addresses. Those input transactions are then used, and cannot be inputs to other transactions.
So if you have a 1 BTC transaction coming to an address and want to spend 0.1 of it, you need to create a second output of 0.9 back to your own "change" address. You can, however, use the originating address as the change address, and therefore can do with only one address forever. People don't do this for obvious privacy reasons.

The paper is about running Bitcoin nodes through TOR. It describes a convoluted theoretical attack, but it might be feasible at a large scale (only skimmed through it).

Whether you'd find same line of code depends on the implementation. With Peercoin, yes, with Monero, probably no. But "fatal" flaws wouldn't be implementation specific things anyway.
Actually, I'm not sure some newly discovered vulnerability in one of the algorithms used would necessarily be fatal. Changing them would be very difficult, but not impossible given the stakes. A fatal blow would likely be a combination of these in a way that can't be fixed without re-thinking the whole decentralized currency concept.

I agree. It shouldn't be too much of a problem, maybe except people who mine on a Raspberry Pi.
However, it seems people still prefer mining on pool like ghash.io. You just buy a mining device, plug it in, install a miner and point it to the pool.
With p2pool, you need to install two additional software packages, download the chain, open ports and arrange disk space. On top of that, bandwidth requirements of running a full node might interfere with your gaming, so you want to do some traffic shaping. Maybe it's too much work for most miners.
A distro that does some of this automatically is a very good idea. But it still requires a dedicated machine (not sure if that's a problem for most miners), disk space and bandwidth.
Having p2pool connect to trusted sources to get the required data would result in a very lightweight, almost plug-and-play solution. As I said, it is definitely worse than running the full node yourself, but can still be worth it if it will distribute hashing power more homogenously.

I don't think this would weaken, let alone kill Bitcoin as a mainstream currency in the USA.
1. Coinbase implements a feature that calculates the taxes, assuming all Bitcoin exchange and transactions are done through them.
2. They also come up with a user-side cold storage scheme that helps them associate redeemed coins with coin purchases (fungibility can be respected here), so that they can perfectly calculate tax while not forcing to user to keep all their money online.
This relieves almost all the work regarding taxation from the user while attracting concerned users to the Coinbase platform.
Replace Coinbase with your favorite US based service.
Also, a multi-platform software wallet could also do this, albeit with a bit of more work, though it also could be automated through exchange API's.

This is one of the things I can draw parallels with the article's argument.
One of the things everyone is having problems with is consumer protection. On one hand we have a multitude of already implemented solutions (Bitrated, Openbazaar, etc.), which don't require giving complete control over funds, don't (in theory) require fees unless there is a dispute and don't allow censorship. I'm sure developers and hard core Bitcoin users have no problem utilizing these. On the other hand, there is no apparent effort in creating a standard ubiquitous system. Of course assessing "good enough" solutions is always hard and risky, but I feel that "smart people" (obviously not an appropriate label) tend to focus on all-or-nothing approaches in these cases.

I know mortgages are an important part of the modern economy, but when I was young, mortgages were almost unheard of in my country. You would accumulate money, and then buy a house, or otherwise rent. It may not be good for the GDP figure, but I think it's a decent "solution", maybe because I think debt relations are corruptive.
Assuming Bitcoin is deflationary, accumulating enough money would not be so hard. Assuming it's more volatile, you could accumulate wealth by buying shares in real estate (either one property to eventually own or a set of properties to eventually sell) with your earnings.
@_date: 2014-04-24 07:24:25
The true problem where? There is no golden rule that says oligarchs are capitalists. Granted, people who come to power eventually become capitalists but they are not necessarily capitalist culture, and even though they almost always have to serve the will of some form of accumulated power, capitalists being the most versatile, they very often play different groups simultaneously.
I guess what you say could apply to more steadier "democracies" where strong cultural differences are successfully indoctrinated out of people.
However, think about what would happen if the oligarchs moved out of the way. Which mechanism do you think would prevent tyranny of the majority? I am sure you do not believe it, but that's pretty much the main reason people never seriously want to get rid of the oligarchs altogether. Your neighbor is worse for you than the capitalist tyrant.


Depends on what we are talking about. Bitcoin is very generic. Imagine a different system that supports welfare by itself (e.g. a small amount of coins are regularly issued to all members equally). I don't believe this would work, but let's suppose it does. Voluntarily using such a system is not deciding on someone else's behalf, and there are no natural competitors, so I don't think it's voting in the political context. Developing the system itself is developing the policy, and choice is voluntary, so it can't be oligarchical.
In a superposition situation though, the above will stop working even if it did work by itself. A common protocol that makes decisions more sticky could be useful in these cases. How to do this without being too restrictive, I don't know. Property rights is the best proposition so far.
These governance models can get extremely sophisticated, and there will always be a few that have the skills to program them. Then, voluntary movement between different implementations can somewhat resemble voting, but still, you won't be voting something out of existence.

Doing it reliably on a non-hierarchical network is the novel part.
If memory serves, digital scarcity has always been a problem. Maybe the reason academics aren't all over it is because Bitcoin is a very messy way to solve it. It is also the reason they were never able to come up with a practical solution.

That group of solutions are more of a distributed approach than a decentralized one (differences in routing, data redundancy, scalability, privacy, etc.). Diaspora is not very big on privacy either (e.g. admins do know about the content and can censor/report). Other, more decentralized solutions, require the user to run their own server 24/7, which is just not going to catch on.
So I would prefer if we can get something that is decentralized, persistent, fast and doesn't require physical user effort to run. Bitcoin brought monetary incentives in the equation, which apparently changed how people reasoned about these designs.

This is a very naive generalization. Unlucky for you, you are cornered into using their criteria of "good", which is pretty far from what is actually good for human well-being. Even so, "other places" are vast.
What those guys need to realize is, similar lines are used by the politicians of those "other places". If "you are better off" doesn't work, "it's even worse in America/Sweden/Japan/etc." can be used.

Actually, booting from an optical to a clean environment has something to do with security.

I don't understand what you think I mean really. There is probably a huge difference in perspective here.
If your argument is that soldiers can't kill their citizens, then it is provably wrong. It is also not so different than killing other civilians. It is done regularly during duty, which causes all sorts of trauma on the perpetrator.
You probably imagine that I imagine some sort of brainwashing going on that turns regular people into psychopathic killing machines. Actually, I've been to the military. That's not how things work, really. Cultural orientation is just about enough to enable people to submit to some high authority and mentally designate them as the morally responsible entity. This has been demonstrated many times in labs, too, even if you don't accept it as common sense.
Maybe the confusion is caused by me saying they return "morally clean as a baby". I meant that from the perspective of society. It is more difficult for the soldier to not be aware of the hysteria.
Also, I think your logic is wrong on a more direct level. You can make a person do something that they will regret.

It's generated locally on the browser, and it's usually recommended that you save the web page and run it on an always offline machine (or one booted with an offline live CD).

I couldn't agree more. We are putting a lot of effort into things that won't matter much in the long run. Bitcoin means a lot of things, and it makes the most sense when considered as a technological movement which includes many things that are not Bitcoin in the simplest sense. While developing Bitcoin, we will also have to develop an intricate symbiotic structure which comprises many systems that are both efficient and resilient to corruption. It is not easy, but we are making way.

Installing a **watch-only** Electrum wallet on the server and pulling a different address each time is an idea.
An even simpler idea is to generate a few thousand addresses from whichever Bitcoin client you use, put them in a text file and pull a new address for each donation.
Cycling addresses that are shown publicly doesn't increase a lot of privacy over using a single address.

Turkish people can be very cynical when it comes to money, which could turn out to be your biggest challenge. However, tourism may be an important vector for shifting the sentiment. Bitcoiners are likely to check out venues that accept it, so it can be a win-win right away.
Bad news is, MASAK (Turkish FinCEN) recently said that they will keep a record of everyone who send money to companies that sell Bitcoin. On the flipside, this makes me think that they intentionally wanted to leave inbound remittances and exports alone.
Which brings me to the harder to pull off but more interesting subject of business to business exports. Matchmaking would be a nightmare at this stage, but it's something to look out for. Bitcoin can be used to replace many of the mechanisms currently in place, but there is a long way to go both in terms of usability an acceptance. This would have to begin with small proof-of-concept trades.

You are saying that they received and *used* this "easy money" and when the lender got into trouble and asked their money back, they got into trouble. How is it not their fault entirely?
I guess it's a matter of perspective. When governments are involved, it becomes completely unclear whose fault is what. It's not like people can do anything about it, so holding these entities accountable is only useful for political play.


I think all lenders and borrowers participated in the crisis. It's your responsibility to know whether the scheme you are participating in is sustainable.


I'm not clear in the current status there. Can people with *insured* deposits withdraw as much as they can now?
I agree with your initial point though, it's 100% fair to warn people that Bitcoin deposits in deposit taking institutions are not insured by the government. "Normal currency" isn't automatically insured either, though people already know when it is and when it isn't.
It still looks stupid though.

The Orwellian dystopia is about privilege. How would the 1984 setting work if everyone had equal access to information about others? How would things turn out if everyone could observe the dealings of bureaucrats as clearly as they observed the public?
And what if the tech involved was completely voluntary?
I don't see any parallels between voluntary publicization of information and Orwellian dystopia.
Then again, Bitcoin is not really clear publicization of information. It provides equal access, but what that information represents is a completely different matter. It's not really that hard to make provably untraceable transactions using Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is actually like the Internet; it provides no guarantees of anonymity, but a guarantee of access. This base layer provides more than enough means to achieve sufficient anonymity.

You didn't, but it's been going on, so I shared my thoughts. No offense.


They didn't come to Reddit to read about Bitcoin. A decent (edit: not only in amount, but well suited to the flow of discussion, etc.) tip might make you pleasantly surprised and intrigued, and less than a cent might make it look like promotional spam. A similar case is spam satoshis my wallets receive all the time, and they are an unwelcome distraction even though I am a Bitcoin user.

Ethereum is actually a useful experiment. Bitcoin was almost becoming Turing complete a few years ago, and fortunately it didn't. Someone else ought to do it and see whether it is the best approach. Maybe it will have too much overhead, too open to abuse or maybe just not that useful. Or it might be alright.
Regarding the "scam" criticism, I guess it depends on how you look at it.
If the code isn't developed to a satisfactory degree, you might want to call it a scam. There is no indication that this will be the case, but I'm sure there will be many shitstorms about this, since a project of this magnitude can't be pulled off without delays.
However, I wouldn't call it a "scam" if investors don't get returns. I actually sent them some money, but see it as a donation (and it would be good to have a few to test the system). The code is very likely to be used for sidechains if they ever become a thing.
On the other hand, comparing the money they raised with other similarly useful projects like DarkWallet and experiments like OpenBazaar, the "investment" aspect seems to have worked a bit *too* well. That's why you get these strong reactions. I personally reciprocated by donating those projects a lot more.
All in all, one probably shouldn't recommend people to invest money in it (not that it is possible right now), but the tech will certainly be useful.

I don't know the rest of your setup, but in security, doing too much of the same thing is usually accompanied with something getting ignored. 
Using different media for storing keys (online remote backups, partial seed mailed to your aunt in Armenia, etc.), and spreading the amount to different wallets is similar to how I go about it.

* Redditors from "poor countries" can be far richer than you.
* Publicly saying someone is less fortunate because they were born in their homeland can be perceived as severely offensive.
* Perception of money is different everywhere, and random tipping can be interpreted as condescension. The tip payer at least needs to humble himself and do everything to not appear to be doing the other party a favor.

Because they know how the world works. My 78 y.o. great uncle was all over it while his son wasn't interested one bit. Although, a couple of people from my parents' generation (60+) wanted to discuss with me about Bitcoin once, and when I told them about some regulatory concerns, one of them objected saying "But they can't stop it!" before I even got into that part.
It's unlikely for my great uncle to begin using it, since probably no one in the village has ever bought or sold anything online yet. On the other hand, I'm sure he'd consider if there was an appstore accepting it, since he's a geeky cattle farmer, and since he almost certainly doesn't have a credit card.
My impression is, people who get things usually get it. So I don't think the endless explaining and appeals done by most Bitcoin enthusiasts is worth the effort. What we need to do is, use Bitcoin in a way that helps us create new things and produce wealth. If we succeed in building a successful economy despite the limited amount of adoption, the barrier is crossed. But is a much harder undertaking than evangelism.

Anti counterfeit designs are not notarization systems.


Of course I can. You can have a currency without an underlying notarization system. You need something that prevents duplication of value. It could be as simple as a natural phenomenon, like a chemical property.

There are proposed ways of making at least some kind of micropayments with Bitcoin (e.g. if the total payment made is likely high enough, these can be combined and confirmed as a single transaction), although these don't cover Satoshi's examples. Some other methods might be invented in the future though.


Not directly, but Bitcoin's flexibility allows innovation far better than conventional systems. I think when we have a proven model that requires a low enough amount of trust, the micropayment system implemented will be far efficient than what we have now. This model likely will involve contract features (and maybe other capabilities) of Bitcoin, so it's not completely unrelated. OpenTransactions is the most likely candidate for this.

Bitcoin transactions are perfectly traceable, but deniability can increase very rapidly depending on how you use it. Even without mixing them with other people's coins, *some* degree of privacy can be achieved by the mere fact that transactions are pseudonymous. For instance, when you send a random sum from one wallet to the other, an outside observer can't tell who the destination is.
However, the non-technical user is very likely to cause privacy leaks, so some knowledge about how transactions work AND how your wallet software works would be very useful.

I imagine a weighted graph comprising projects and contributors, which I can use to donate to the node I'm most interested in for it to dissipate proportionally into all entities involved, including dependencies. A single tool that makes everything visible. I guess my current verdict is, hard to implement, very unlikely to solve the problem.
Well, anyway, enjoyed the discussion.

It's certainly about politics. Political views are not emotional nonsense. The reason you don't want a centrally controlled currency applies to anything else that involves centralized control.
If you could trust a central entity to be able to adhere to a set of rules, you could implement something like Bitcoin, or related technologies like Ethereum, infinitely more easily and they would work with almost zero cost and perfect efficiency. You can have a single computer process all the world's transactions and it won't break a sweat.
Of course, there are many evils and you may think that government is a lesser one, until good enough solutions are found. Bitcoin may be one of those solutions. Then, we could call you a liberal that is an anarchist at heart. Actually, basically an anarchist.

You're right, although, miners don't receive their entire revenue from currency issue, and the system's long term viability depends on not the currency issue (which is obviously dominant currently), but the fees. Minting by miners is a cool trick Satoshi came up with to make the initial distribution reasonable enough while incentivizing early adoption.
So the word "mining" misses both the fact you mentioned, and the above, which I think are more interesting and essential than coin distribution.
This lead most people, including economists like Krugman, to think that the only reason computational power is being used is to make it hard to issue coins. People who understand Bitcoin use the word "waste" much more cautiously.

That criterion cannot be honestly applied, since everyone wants to change Bitcoin's consensus rules through a hard fork eventually.
The disagreement is about how it should happen, not whether it should. You don't want to censor Bitcoin Core's hard forking changes just because it is uncertain whether they will be accepted by the majority.

[Bitcoin XT]( is a fork of Bitcoin Core that supports some extensions that enable apps like Lighthouse.
The controversy is, XT now includes a patch from Gavin Andresen that is planned to hard fork Bitcoin to enable a larger maximum block size. If at any point after the beginning of 2016, 75% mining power begins producing XT-voting blocks, all XT nodes will begin accepting big blocks (after a 2-week grace period).
So, since this client has the potential to become a fork in a future date, it is now forbidden to talk about it in All posts linking to articles that contain a link to it, all posts discussing this censorship and all posts linking to alternative communication channels have been removed, together with a great chunk of comments. People talking about XT after the censor are being banned. I think we are still allowed to talk about it in this sticky as says in the OP, but I may still be banned for linking to it.

Sorry, I didn't mean to spark you into writing that much. :-)
I agree with you on the fact that raw and vulgar rhetoric will not appeal to anyone other than some particular circles.


Well, I assume we agree that people actively support the structure they have faith in, whether they are aware of it or not. It shapes their entire lives and how they perceive the world.


Eventually yes (by your definition of these terms), but initially?
Bitcoin propounds a completely different structure. Sure, maybe you hope to integrate it in some sort of seamless way into the "normal". I am rather skeptical about that.
Let me ask you this question instead: if banks, government, surveillance, centralization, etc. do not pose any threats, why adopt something like Bitcoin in the first place?
You could say that, even though the non-ideologically-motivated (in quotes) do not perceive the threat, it is there and Bitcoin can get around it without the subject even noticing, while at the same time making itself more appealing than the alternatives. That would be a colossal undertaking, and considering that trust based systems are much more efficient at "agreeing on facts" (which we call consensus in Bitcoin), it may very well be a losing battle.
So maybe some "believing in" is necessary, at least in the form of acknowledging some facts that are currently widely ignored.


I think peoples of developed countries tend to have more respect for top-town promoted normalcy, as they have the somewhat justified idea of being *better-off*. Elsewhere, distrust of "the system" is more common, in some places actually being the norm, but what is common is that everyone is stuck in their respective age old dichotomies.
In summary, instead of promoting Bitcoin as something that can fill the holes in the system and work it better (this is far from being established, to the point of being insincere), we need to strive to change the normal into something better. The way to do this is not to go into rhetorical battles with the normal, but instead build robust structures that will compare better. Those who build these will not be the non-ideologically-motivated though.
My humble opinions. :-)

The impression I got from Gavin is that he believes there is urgency, and not waiting for the "technical review" to conclude will accelerate the process. The review can happen in parallel during the (arguably) ample time left, anyway. I can't know whether his frustration is justified.
From my perspective as a node, they are providing an outside alternative I can fall back to if the current process fails for some reason. I suspect there will be more soon, with different parameters.

@_date: 2015-08-16 11:42:00
Yes, we have a fundamental difference in perspective.
I agree with the importance of the "normal procedure". But from the network's perspective, it can not mean anything. If it did, we would have forked it long ago into not having that restriction. No one signed up to be bound to a central committee.
To be clear, I do agree with the Core's decision to be cautious towards a hard fork. I don't agree with the perspective that such hard forks are off-topic or offensive in any way. Bitcoin requires a culture that does not see them that way to stay alive.
If I want to change the consensus rules on the node I am running, together with a big chunk of the network, I am not trying to force commits to some random code base in the ethereal realm. From my perspective, the origin of the change is my personal consideration only.
The developers can have any quarrels they like. Git, unlike our beloved Bitcoin forums, is completely decentralized. They can fight over commit access, create forks, whatever. I on the other hand, as a user, I require all of it to be transparently available to me.
Sorry for the long reply. Trying to communicate these things exceed my rhetorical talents.

Yes, they are just one of the components.


Still though, in theory, all miners' interests (not only pools) can be in conflict with everyone else's. However in the case of the vote going in a bad way, I assume nodes can take the initiative and fall back to non-forking state, denying the forking power to majority miners. I think this is good enough for a temporary conflict settling mechanism.
It's also important to note that engineers are notoriously bad at predicting social consequences. For instance, currently the majority mining power seems to support large blocks, which should be counter intuitive if you believe small blocks will result in more fees. The truth is, there are a million factors that can't really be formalized.

I am sorry, but that doesn't communicate much to me. Any hard fork attempt will be contentious to a degree.
Let's say Bitcoin Core comes up with a hard fork to increase the block size more moderately, but a certain group of developers and wallet operators is objecting. Actually I'm pretty sure it will happen if it continues to go this way. Will you advocate a censorship in that case as well? If so, there isn't more to discuss here.


I understand what you are saying. But if we are to stay away from ill defined criteria fit only for senseless politics, this still counts as much of a "noise" as the rant about Blockstream's evil profit motives.
Overall, you may think that you are justified, but IMHO this attitude is a better way to destroy Bitcoin than pushing a contentious hardfork.

Depends on many factors really.

@_date: 2015-08-05 11:57:36


Essentially the miner broadcasts the proof of work, along with a transaction to itself (a generation transaction), which cannot be spent for 100 blocks. This means, the entire network has to accept this information, and majority mining power has to build 100 new blocks on top of it, each accepting the one before it as authentic.
There are two things that can break this process.
One is an exploit getting discovered in the proof-of-work algorithm, which would ultimately result in Bitcoin replacing it with another one.
The other is, majority mining power getting controlled by an attacker, which incidentally would also result in the replacement of the proof-of-work algorithm. This one is usually considered the most important threat to Bitcoin.


The important thing one needs to understand is, everyone running a Bitcoin node decides on the rules. There is no voting system in place at the fundamental level. Currently there doesn't seem to be an "intentional" disagreement on the rules, so everyone is running the same "Bitcoin".
If there was disagreement, and say some part of the network decided to support bigger blocks, they would practically become a new network. This is called a hard fork.
Ultimately, there is no person or entity that can choose on behalf of nodes. However, it is in everyone's interest to agree on the rules, hence the never ending debates.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:50:27


I don't know what you mean by "uncertain". At this point, any of the hard forking proposals may or may not be implemented, and at least one "Core" developer has a relatively concrete [hard forking proposal](
Although, this is not important as almost all Core developers have stated that block size limit should be changed through a hard fork at one point. (edit: Assume, for instance, that Gregory Maxwell's idea of "increasing the blocksize if push comes to shove" needs to be implemented. Will you link the binaries from here and bitcoin.org? Will you let people discuss it? Isn't that a double standard?)


Again, you cannot honestly apply this standard to all hard forks.
From the network's perspective, there can be no difference between a hard fork by the Bitcoin Core team and a hard fork by random user. Otherwise the network can not be called decentralized.


Yes, because XT doesn't implement BIP 100. :)
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:04:01


Well if there had been time to discuss it, I'm sure it would be contentious. Just like max block size debate wouldn't be if it was urgent. You are technically right though.


If that is the picture, sure. But without being agnostic about the legitimacy of consensus rules, I don't know how the debate can advance in a manner that would not require pseudovotes.
Also of note is, you have previously stated that certain elements may benefit from "faking" opinion in the case of contentious hard forks, which should have quite the same effect (maybe even more so in cases) when near consensus is assumed.
So in a way, this censorship spree suggests that there wasn't much Gavin could do other than support a contentious hard fork, assuming he thinks he's right.
In the example I have given, the objecting camp will likely be within the range between a single lone nut and vast support. I am fully expecting a double standard at any rate.

Keep in mind that a sidechain Bitcoin 2.0 can fail (or succeed) because of an unrelated factor. Besides, someone has to develop these systems (wallets, exchanges, payment processors, etc.; e.g. atomic swaps were described many years ago, yet AFAIK it is still not the dominant method for exchanging currencies), for which incentives are as of yet unclear.
I'm all for the process you've described, but asking people to hold their breaths and wait for a technology that many have raised convincing concerns about to deliver a solution that can deliver a solution, might not be the best approach.
Garzik is right:






We need a predictable algorithm that determines the fate of Bitcoin transactions into the far future. We need to be able to produce simulations that can predict fees for different scenarios 10 years from now.
Until we have this, making the economy fit into assigned arbitrary constants deserves a very good explanation (I won't call it an idiot's approach out of respect to the programmers, but I would expect it not to be treated as the obvious/default choice). Not only because the chosen state of the economy and the constants themselves reveal any rationale, but also because they have to be re-assigned by central committees, which will inevitably lead to a re-occurrence of what the market will have to go through.

I agree that what you are describing is ideal. However, Gavin seems to claim that this process failed at delivering something soon enough. If true (there are normative components to this claim, so I concede that it is objectively undecidable), the action he is taking is quite valid. Ultimately, it is not the end of the world and does not prevent the process you are advocating from vindicating itself.
Regarding the controversy, I think the censorship spree, Satoshi impostors, etc. created a much more unprofessional image than the implementation of one of the many hard forking proposals.

I hope most readers are more mature than the mods here and upvote posts like this that are worthy of discussion.
I am not a "forker" at all (I am only guessing what it's supposed to mean here, since everyone supports an eventual hard fork), but I will try to respond from that viewpoint.


I think most "forkers" want a continuously scaling limit, and the ultimate limit is not 8MB.


Lightning networks can prove to be useful on that front.


If it "wins", then I suppose so. Otherwise, no.


I think the XT concept is a bit awkward anyway. A new repository with only Gavin's patch should be authoritative, but AFAIK no one stepped up to maintain such a thing.


Why is it important whether XT is an altcoin? If Bitcoin users want to discuss rule changes, they should be able to.
To avoid ill defined terms that can only be useful in political manipulation, I suggest any hard fork should be called an altcoin. Bitcoin is ultimately an altcoin of the original Bitcoin.

No. But if Feathercoin was a successful attempt to change Litecoin's consensus rules by supermajority consent, then it would be Litecoin.
From the technical perspective you are using, there is no difference between planned hard forks. So when Bitcoin Core team comes up with a hard fork idea (e.g. sipa's proposal), then you will need to censor links to their binaries.
That is, of course, unacceptable. So what are these criteria that make a hard fork, the true fork? Can there ever be a non-contentious hard fork?


If a considerable number of Litecoin users want it to be, then obviously yes. Just like news that don't mention "Bitcoin" specifically, but can be of interest. This should also cover any technically informative posts about altcoin development.

Well, certainly not.
Its opensource nature implies it can be *successfully* forked. Possibility of *successful* forks is by far the number one protection and advantage of open source software. Many of them survived by forking out of a broken development regime.
If this did not exist, I personally would have just ignored it altogether the moment I heard about it, so would any intelligent person. Bitcoin wouldn't even make it to Slashdot.
I am not saying the regime is broken. I am saying that I do not support actions that presuppose that it is not. I also do not understand how one can support this manner of centralization and still be interested in a flat structure like Bitcoin.
Miners do not have a role in this context, as we are not discussing the nature of a specific fork. Any fork can have its own policies, which can survive or die by their own merits.

Does it matter? If Bitcoin can't scale as it is, it will be made to scale by risking decentralization. It is not something that can be controlled, by design.




You already agree that the limit shall be changed at one point anyway, but think it will not lead to a trend because you assume the metrics will be crystal clear (I presume). Why doesn't my suggestion fit into those constraints?


I hoped people would come up with better ways to make Bitcoin scale, but I wasn't aware of anything. :-)


So how do we measure whether blocks are full enough and fees are high enough? What are the criteria for Bitcoin Core increasing the block size limit?
I understand what you are saying, but making promises to the public is an entirely different challenge. Currently, from the users' perspective, nothing is concrete.




Whom should I cite? Most think raising the block size soft limit without it giving rise to a functioning fee market caused the current problems, like wallets not predicting good enough fees, services relying on low fees, etc. Some think keeping the block size limit will motivate people to invest/work on other scaling solutions.
If it is essential, I can work on making a list of who said what, but the debate is all around the place.

Your distinction does not make any sense. XT *is* Bitcoin until it forks off in a future date. If does not ever reach 75% support, it will still go on as an alternative Bitcoin client. It is the only Bitcoin software that supports Lighthouse-like servers, that are fully Bitcoin in every sense.
Also, you are trying hard to miss my point. Bitcoin Core will hard fork too, and your criterion does ban the talk about the forking software. It *needs* to be talked about *prior* to the fact. Censoring that will harm Bitcoin in every way.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:43:53
It's a matter of opinion at this stage.
I for one think Bitcoin *can* be made to scale either way. And there will be many challenges, different in nature but similar in complexity, either way.
So, no, some devs have very peculiar characters and at least appear immature, but I am confident that everyone wants Bitcoin to scale one way or the other.
The problem is the worry people have that the support for their idea will be weakened if they acknowledge the merits of opposing ideas *within the same rhetoric*. It is self-fulfilling; since everyone acts this way, you can easily be ignored for being vague and confusing just by pointing out different conflicting ideas. A matter of culture.
Doesn't it resemble the debate we should be having about how the human society should scale in number? Debates of the Bitcoin land seem stressful when you are in it, but while they suffer from similar weaknesses, I think intellectually we are going on the right direction.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:30:51
Oh, I'm talking about a tree structure at the conceptual level, where anyone can fork off with their own consensus rules (slightly differing within limits) but transactions can take place between different branches.
I am too ignorant to understand whether this conforms with Peter Todd's tree-chain idea, as I don't recall whether it deals with differing consensus rules. I guess I'd better go inform myself.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:13:05
I'm not so sure. To me, the best guarantee of value is millions of ordinary people utilizing it. A market with large and few (but conceptually atomic) transactions would be less resilient in comparison.
Either way, as a business owner, I would still need a way to buy coffee with my earned large transaction, and centralized wallets / exchanges add many inconveniences and risks.
Still, I would agree that Bitcoin can scale far better as a settlement layer (few transactions with higher fees, as you suggest). Payment channels, for instance, allows two parties to make as many trustless transactions as they want between themselves, which can be settled (with a single transaction) on the blockchain whenever they prefer. Lightning is extending this idea to a whole network (which have to get online within a deadline to actually receive money though). So on and so forth...
Having said that, it assumes all these components (e.g. Lightning) are present in a convenient way for the end user. So we should be wary of breaking the tools that are currently being used until these solutions are ready. Which means, increasing the blocksize limit (not urgent), not introducing anything that makes zero-confirmation transactions less reliable, etc.
@_date: 2015-08-12 11:01:11
It is like a database, but in blocks. You know, like a locomotive train. Instead of generic queries you do on the entire database, you now need to move whole blocks of records around, index them locally, reindex them for specific applications, and then make only very simple queries, and then parse the results. Ah, and you also need to preserve the complete database locally.

You are right, if there were no friction, all interested parties could be represented in the form of mining power. I am not convinced that we should rely on this assumption in practice, however.
Since mining is zero sum with no barriers of entry, miner profitability depends on the edge they have over other miners. So, if a faction of miners (and their investors) would gain more advantage over the others on a certain change, they will be inclined to vote for it. Other than this, I would expect them to vote for what they think is best for Bitcoin users in general, if only because they are invested.
I guess we already agree that the solution is at least "good enough". We can discuss this to death, but none of this would convince the Core team to implement the change you are talking about. :-)

The blockchain-ness only provides a pointer, a linked list of hashes of records, for the purpose of sanity checking. It should be roughly equivalent any sort of such checks, and inconsistencies can be resolved by pulling missing records out of the shared ledger.
Permission is a contract. Hence "closed".

I am not too convinced with the miners' vote trigger either, but since what you have surmised is true (i.e. potential of miners mining fools gold), it would be rather naive to expect miners to switch *before* merchants/exchanges/etc. announce their support, don't you think?

I believe consensus building among peers, that it is achievable and that it is the best option when available.
But to be honest, if the consensus building process you are talking about requires the community communication channels to be filtered in order to work, on which apparently all involved agree with, the project itself loses its most important justifications.
@_date: 2015-08-01 10:21:01
Bitcoin is a fully decentralized system. Like BitTorrent, for instance, but more so.
There are no gatekeepers or administrators to authenticate, approve, filter, censor, etc. It is a fully open system with no pre-defined social hierarchy.
Since it is impossible to physically protect Bitcoin from attackers within and without, it needs something irreproducible to accompany blocks of transactions in its distributed database. It uses proof of computational work as that irreproducible thing, since it can be communicated only with numbers. This protects the transaction history from being manipulated.
To incentivize the computational work, those who produce them (who are called miners, a very bad analogy) are rewarded through newly issued currency (bitcoins) and transaction fees.
As for profits, GPU mining era is now left far behind, and application specific devices are being used.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:55:09


Practical differences matter, though. If your lightweight protocol supports connecting to multiple interchangeable servers simultaneously, lagging nodes will not cause a lot of problems for the whole system. Which is not the case for AFAIK any of the other protocols mentioned, at least not fully.
In the end, there is no point in running an always lagging Electrum server, but otherwise you might not care about the difference between 30 seconds or 90. Confirmation time variability is quite high anyway.


Good to know.

Hardware wallets solve that issue, although they still have a long way to go regarding usability and privacy. If you can afford a Trezor, I think you will be fine.
@_date: 2015-08-07 08:39:57
You are technically right.
Regardless, putting transactions in blocks and labeling them with hashes does not strike me as something that would be required, let alone desired, if you are not trying to match the shortcomings of massive decentralization over an unpredictable (i.e. uncontrolled) network.
So, I would rather emphasize access rather than mutability as the main difference. If you are creating a planned and controlled network between known entities, using a blockchain seems to be one of the most inefficient designs you could base it on.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:05:10


I've also been thinking about this for some time actually. There is no reason all ideas can't compete in parallel. As long as any one of them needs a supermajority to trigger the fork, including a grace period of at least a month, it should be fine.


Not a bad idea at all. Pools can also come up with their own condorcet system or such in order to not risk miners leaving them (and end with multiple results), but even without it, what individual miners want should eventually determine the pool votes through market forces.
I somewhat agree with Luke-jr's criticism, but I don't think his alternative solutions are good enough either. The best way is to go ahead and implement this on top of Core, initially without including the forking code to gauge interest (letting all nodes announce their interest through the user agent string might also be a good idea), and move on from there.
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:31:57
For those who are ignorant about the difference, can you briefly expand on this?
Is it soft because even though updated nodes would reject your larger-than-1M blocks and fork out, you could still use their chain as long as you comply with their rules and never produce/build-on a large block?
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:02:56
I guess you could also rent a mining rig and direct it to p2pool (or any other pool that pays directly out of the generation transaction). Or solo mine. Would this cost more or less?
edit: Judging by the figures on betarigs.com, the additional cost would be comparable.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:41:11
To be honest, I would have done the same when faced with such a hopeless situation for the party. It's not really a very complicated plan. And doing what's best for the people you know and care about instead of a large group of people you have no actual relation to, is not evil.
The problem is not the politicians, it is having them in the first place and relying on them. And ultimately believing in the spirit of the nation, which has its dual in the state. My only hope is at one point, such beliefs would be perceived as equivalents of religious discrimination.

So you believe that, if no one can develop a way to make Bitcoin satisfactorily scale other than big blocks (which would lead to centralization pressures), and Core does not change the consensus rules, no fork of Core can possibly be supported by an overwhelming majority?
If so, then there isn't much to discuss. I think people see a bigger spectrum of (de-)centralization and trade-offs, and will move on to what scales up.


Sure, but what are the actual formal metrics? Is there a program I can run that gives me these numbers?

That's not what I said at all. There is a wide range of possibilities between an effectively single node and everyone running bitcoind on first generation RasPi.
My point was, it is not a slippery slope.


All I'm saying is, some people envisioned only serious businesses/guilds being able to run nodes at one point. It is not ideal maybe, but it can and will still be discussed as an option if the system can't scale otherwise.
I think decentralization can be improved without ultra high block sizes. But I also admit that Bitcoin will be useless for most purposes if it can't be made to scale. So tolerating "freeloaders" until scaling solutions emerge is a sensible compromise.

Why not?
Sure, you could put all nodes hosted on a specific provider in the same group, as they are susceptible to manipulation/control by the same entity. You could also group them by jurisdiction, and even by international treaties.
Running from your house is the best shot at autonomy, but is the Bitcoin protocol even safe from manipulation by ISP's?
The way I see it, when one of these groups attack Bitcoin, the sheer number of remaining nodes still count, even with these groupings.

As I said, I've been to that subreddit once, maybe twice. It was full of misinformation, hate and envy. Your perspective might be allowing you to see beyond them (e.g. read everything "within context"). But you can already do it in If all this fuss is about getting a few downvotes from teenagers, then moving away from Reddit would make a lot of sense.


I'll take your word for it. I also did my first actual trades in Bitcoin back when GPU's were getting popular.


Are you claiming there is a causal relation there?


Bitcoin being anarchistic is as much a "scientific fact" (I'm attempting to imitate your standards of science here) as "this shit don't scale".
I in turn want to debate about Bitcoin, both for its technological merits (or deficiencies) and political consequences, without being unnecessarily praised or pissed on (both camps do both). To me, these "buttcoin" people and the "pump dump" people are exactly the same model, just with different mental configurations. They are likely also overlapping sets.


Good example. There are people trying to pump Bitcoin mindlessly, because GREECE. This is also both a good chance to observe and produce legitimate use cases for Bitcoin, which are criticized for trying to make money off of the human misery.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralized ledger with a unit of account called bitcoin. The network is not encrypted, but similar technologies are used to make sure the data going through it is authentic.


Whether this is intrinsic to they system is unknown at this point. Since the market is very shallow, exchange rates are all over the place, but some think it will stabilize in time.


Pretty much true. Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, but they are also public. If you know what you are doing it enables very high levels of privacy, but you can also use it in a way that exposes all your personal affairs to the whole world.


You can do mining for educational purposes, it helps the network (maybe not the added mining power itself, but it getting more decentralized), but it is too time consuming even if you do it only for fun. I would rather put my effort into running a [node]( that is consistently online. Having your own node can help with privacy as well.

Yeah I did it, but it was in my previous comment, which I forgot to say. Sorry again.


This is where we disagree, apparently. I will try to do a better job this time (risking slightly generalizing the topic):
* The only way to avoid block sizes getting bigger and the resulting centralization pressure, is developing alternative ways to scale up while still providing a good enough user experience.
* Fending off this specific centralization pressure in the meantime by depressing block sizes might not work because the probability of Bitcoin getting successfully forked will increase until better scaling methods arrive.
* Promising a moderate increase in block size, or adopting a moderate self-adjusting algorithm will not necessarily lead to a trend.
* More essentially, presenting a concrete strategy to the public should be a requirement (i.e. Garzik is right). This might even help us avoid a hard fork.
I expected everyone to agree with these, but apparently not. The disagreement seems to rise from the fact that the current constrains are hoped to affect social behavior. I find it unwise, but that would lead to an even more generic philosophical debate I'm afraid.

Having more autonomy instead of one-size-fits-all elements *is* better though. In this case, it could mean printing more money.
Then again, it calls into question what difference the one-size-fits-all elements introduced by the claimant of authority over the people living in this geographic region could have. They are the same in principle. You always have subsets that would be better served by increased autonomy.
The ultimate solution would be everyone using their preferred currency, economic policy, etc. regardless of birthright (or birthburden?).

It can be close to zero, depending on the circumstances.
Optimally, cost of Bitcoin hashpower should converge to an amount matching the power of an anticipated attacker. In a peaceful world where rich and powerful states stop being potential attackers, you could in theory have a situation where the per-transaction cost almost linearly decreases with an increased number of transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:33:34

The fork does not need to be branded as XT, as it depends on nothing on XT, but only Gavin's patch. Anyone who distrusts the repository can take Core, patch it and distribute it that way.

There isn't really a push for keeping up with the bleeding edge, and many would argue that it's better not to break a setup that is working, unless there is an urgency (vulnerabilities, protocol updates, etc.). When there is a need for upgrade, people are more easily mobilized.
Having said that, I think sipa wants to leave ample time for research, which is a different subject.
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:47:48
Likewise, the contrary seems clear to me. :-)
I can't come up with one right now, but there must be other ways for initial distribution than centralized issuance (pre-mine, n coins per citizen, etc.).
For instance, if someone invented a way to make it sybil resistant (most likely impossible), nodes could be continuously rewarded for the amount of data they store and transactions they relay. You could then have the coins issued this way and let miners be supported by fees. (Then again, nodes would be called miners I guess.)
Anyway, thanks for the debate. I'll have to think about this a bit more.

Well, don't let me keep you by asking questions.

To be honest, I've been using the cli tools ([python2-trezor]( to initialize, set homescreen, etc. so I am not up to date on which user-friendly tool does these things better.
I have a general distrust for browser-based stuff, so forgive me for using the phrase "proper wallet". I do use Electrum, which is very flexible and has tons of features.

Regardless, true sidechains can't survive a reorg at a certain length, because main chain is agnostic towards sidechains. It's not a bug, it's a feature, and I do think sidechains are a good idea, but you don't really understand them.

Hehe, hash trees are far older than "git".


No it was not. In fact, there was no convergence towards Bitcoin, and ideas that vaguely hinted at something like that were extremely sparse.
To be honest, I was expecting someone to come up with a decentralized ripple, and dismissed Bitcoin when I first heard about it, convinced that there should be a gimmick somewhere in there.

I get it now. It seems to be a reflection of this "slippery slope":


@_date: 2015-07-24 09:37:51


If you did not exaggerate (slippery slope?), that is exactly many of us envisioned. A few hundred nodes ran by large merchants, serious hobbyists, banks, exchanges, mining groups, etc. Enough nodes in enough different jurisdictions would do.
In fact, the situation is quite similar. The newcomers (and some oldies as well) began to advertise "everyone can run their own banks at home", in the manner some did "free instant transactions forever".
No one actually said these (especially the latter), but both are "perceived" to be advocated by opposing groups.
I am personally hopeful that we can do without the scenario I envisioned when I first began using Bitcoin. If we can do better decentralization, what more can a user ask? But saying nobody envisioned ~~it~~ (edit: should have said "a lower number of nodes") is a disservice to the debate.

It makes sense if the investment is expected to appreciate faster, or is deemed safer.
Also, I don't think anyone will ever "have to" use Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin will run out of competitors. So I don't agree that it's a "built-in analog to interest", in that you will never ever know that you will have more purchasing power next year. I actually see that sort of allocation as a sane alternative to risk-free interest, which can't exist anyway.
I'm no expert but no one being constrained to Bitcoin in any way seems also relevant to the deflationary spiral issue. For instance, gold existing by itself doesn't seem to cause deflationary spirals anywhere. It also doesn't necessarily appreciate in value.
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:04:15
Is this where you explain it:


If there is consensus, what sort of split are you talking about?
EDIT: Maybe I should clarify the question.
You are saying that new features can be tested as sidechains, and if they work, can be included in Bitcoin proper, through a hard fork. So I assume that when calling hard forks "disastrous", your concern is not potential mishaps (i.e. bugs), but the actual political split (i.e. nodes operating with different protocols).
Why would there be such a split in the case of Core deciding on a moderate increase the maximum blocksize?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the current position of most Core developers is that they can easily do a hard fork if the block-size limit becomes a problem. By your standards, this should be much more disastrous than any of the alternatives discussed?
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:23:30
You might have only received the hash.

It *is* a standard RPC call in the Core. I'm a bit disappointed you haven't checked it out before the post.


Because: Develop more measures against spam, then increase the allowed size.
Most of the problems associated with a higher blocksize limit would be eliminated by a perfect fee determining system. It may be impossible to come up with one, but a good enough one is still very desirable.

@_date: 2015-07-07 00:36:14
A bit off-topic, but (4) also shows the benefits of running your own node.
The main reason people do not run Core is because they have no use for it (and in my humblest of opinions, not the blockchain size).
Connecting your SPV wallet to your own node (or a node you have control over, e.g. ran by a group of friends) is good for privacy, reduces risk and helps the network. Connecting to your own Electrum server has the same benefits. So on and so forth...
It's till not for everyone, but I think these can be good enough reasons for technically inclined users.

I think I understand the disadvantages of SPV wallets compared to full nodes, but how can they be any worse than alternative lightweight wallets where you need to trust a single node?

Seems to me they are better than the alternatives either way. What am I missing?

Bitcoin allows capitalism, but whether it's a tool of capitalism is probably a semantic debate. I suspect the article is not using the [wiki definition of capitalism]( which makes Bitcoin clearly capitalistic.

Distribute the data and get the required number of signatures. There, m-of-n shared ledger.
Of course you can make money by developing these solutions, as people have been doing for decades.

@_date: 2015-07-23 11:48:58
Separating such wallets based on purpose and use helps with that somewhat, depending on where you see the weaknesses. Take for instance, keeping a bigger stash in a mostly dormant wallet while using one hot wallet for transactions which don't expose/involve your name and another one that has your personal identity all over it.
Also, in my experience, instead of trying to control addresses individually, cleanly separating wallets this way is far easier and safer.
But ultimately, hunting people down in that manner requires access, skill and time, so it is rather expensive.

Unfortunately yes. Oil is not a free market, and entities who control it already have the ability to move massive amounts of value (e.g. gold) physically through borders (legalities lose meaning at that level), so "trustless" value transfer is not the main problem. Then again, this is a game of confidence, so Bitcoin might be useful in unforeseen ways at one point. Maybe not within 10 years though.
One relevant fact is, western implants have a rough ability the determine the amount of violence in the entire region now, so the idea that Bitcoin will reduce violence will be tricky to sell, even if everyone agrees that it would be "good".

This is what I get from your post: "Don't do anything if it is not going to save the world. If you are doing anything regardless of this, it shows that you have a sinister agenda."

The user is supposed to compare the checksum displayed on Trezor's screen with the one it sees on the computer.
Of course, any "user friendly" interface will make it hard to verify the numbers displayed on the compromised device.

That sounds a bit high-tech, but it is in fact easy to come up with an ad-hoc symmetric cipher. If the data is small, you can even encrypt and perform steganography using stone age techniques.

While what you say is true, I think most of this "troll" speak is fueled by the patronizing or cynical tone of the people mentioned in the OP.
Some began calling their side of the debate more scientific, of course with zero scientific evidence provided. On top of that, some get together in their own forums, randomly making fun of those who don't agree with them.
You should realize that the Bitcoin community was bombarded for years by trolls who claimed Bitcoin will never work for some random reason. This current "misunderstanding" is a purely rhetorical leakage (which has ossified because of the reasons above) created during the time when (for instance) "instant confirmations using a green-address like system can be made possible in the future" or "lightweight protocol layers" made no difference in the discussion with the "critics" at all.

While initializing your Trezor for the first time, you will be asked whether to use a passphrase. (You can use the Chrome extension or CLI tools to do this offline if you please.)
The passphrase is different from the PIN. While PIN controls access to the device, passphrase actually changes the wallet seed. It is essentially a part of the things you need to remember in order to restore your device, so make sure you will be able to. If you are going to write it down, I'd recommend recording it somewhere other than your mnemonic seed for increased security.
If Trezor is initialized with a pass, you will be asked to enter it every time you plug it in. If you enter a "wrong" passphrase, you will end up with a different wallet. You can even enter a blank passphrase, which results in the same wallet you would get without a pass.
Now, after making sure you will remember these different passphrases, you can create a decoy wallet as a measure against "rubber-hose cryptanalysis". Put some money in there, make a couple transactions, so that it looks believable.
Of course, these don't have to be "decoy"s really. You could use different wallets with different passphrases (e.g. for different sorts of payment), and give away the one with the least amount if you are pressured. By being active, they will look more plausible.
It is quite simple really, but depending on the wallet software you use, you might have to manage your external wallet data. For instance, since Trezor by itself doesn't record Address labels and such, my Electrum client has to keep a different wallet file for different passphrases. This also means that someone who has access to my computer will know I have them, so caveat emptor.

I think this is the central misunderstanding that caused the "Bitcoin devs are too conservative" sentiment in this thread.


We do. What we don't is, make outputs cost extra.
According to the OP, Litecoin has a minimum fee "per output", making it expensive to increase the UTXO set. So it doesn't only proportionally charge for the amount of data like Bitcoin, it demands more depending on the transaction content.
Now, should fees be agnostic about what the transaction data contains? It is recently becoming apparent that UTXO is also a valuable resource. But you see, "creative" stuff also includes sending multiple payments at once, considerably reducing the amount of data required to preserve the payment. So it is not that clear cut as you might think.

Interesting idea. I'm not well versed in proof of computation stuff, but to me it looks like in order to verify this proof you would need all the data (or if not then we should be able to prune this data and put it in a DHT anyway).
Even if we assume that it works, I would still need to receive your complete block in order to see if it's valid, which is pretty much identical to what we have now.
In the end, invalid blocks do not exist from the perspective of the nodes who accept the same rules, so this is a problem that needs to be solved from the miners' point of view.

Think of it this way. We currently don't have any ideas about how to build something that can resist a frontal attack by a massively publicly funded power without opposition, other than these existing systems being massively utilized by the same public. You can think of it as increasing the political cost of the attack, while also increasing the investment that secures the network and making the system important enough for more diverse interest groups.

Sure. You can even use the same Trezor hardware wallet with multiple computers, each having different wallet applications (edit: simultaneously, with the same wallet of course).
Electrum now has further plug&amp;play-ness as apparently it sync's your Trezor labels with your other Electrum installations automatically without doing anything other than enabling label sync (all Trezor devices initialized with the same wallet and password get the same labels, too). If you like keeping track of your expenses and cryptographic payment-protocol invoices, it's super convenient.

I was talking about that specific RPC. It uses median values (last I checked, which was some time ago), which is good to get rid of noise. Say, if someone accidentally pays a 100 coin fee (happened plenty of times), it won't create a lasting effect (i.e. increased estimation causing people to pay higher fees, affecting future estimations, etc.).


Yes, although feedback effects are worth analyzing. Even the total network hashrate will depend on fees at one point, which in turn will determine what the fees need to fulfill.

That is the gist of the issue that most people are missing, not only about Bitcoin, but issues of privacy, disintermediation and decentralization. It is not about which system can get you more advantages (presumably for your reptilian self), it is about what *you* are and what role you play. Sure, momentary lapses of the system reveals a lot, but one should not need it to realize they are being guided through life in order for a particular world to emerge.


It all depends on the people. I would prefer people to begin using Bitcoin to make it into a solution, rather than thinking it will be one day and passively waiting (which would directly lead to failure).

Depends on a person's frustration levels I suppose.
I give a shit about not wasting my time on filling multi-page web forms, spending hours to finally figure out that the new CC security stuff can't be activated when I'm abroad, not being able to buy a ticket for somebody else, etc.
Escrow/chargeback would have some value to me in some cases, but not against an airline.
It would also probably depend on how much you think you can rely on your bank siding with you in case of a dispute. I have minimal confidence, to be frank.

I'm sure those guys chat a lot on the Internet for obvious reasons, but I don't know how one could claim to measure the ideological base of Bitcoin.
Besides, if groups that are handicapped by the centralized systems begin using Bitcoin as an alternative, doesn't that mean the libertarians were right? All the more reason to oppose it, then.

You mean, different people have different opinions?
I think you should relax a bit. Most people don't know what they are talking about (edit: most of the time), and is no different. I've been to your sub once I suppose, and I've read that if your transaction doesn't confirm in 10-15 minutes, BitPay will not ack your payment and your only recourse is crying in confirmed that this was the case. I'm sure I'd be able to find thousands of such misinformation spread there if I had access.
The only scientific fact here is you really really want to see yourself superior to some group of people and strive to discover/define/imagine such groupings.

Let's say "negligible in comparison to most value that is manually transferred by end users in today's world".

A good reason to keep decoys around.
Did you know Trezor doesn't have the ability to validate your passphrase and generates a different wallet for every different pass you enter?
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:50:44
At least, those who will be the first to explore Bitcoin are the least likely ones to have supported the system that caused the problems anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:10:54
A distributed database with centralized control would be far cheaper and much much faster.

This is an essentially anarchic open-source project. If there is "language" out there, it is even undefined where it should be, as we constantly see in the meaningless arguments about who said what initially.
So ultimately the policy is what actually happened, which is the soft blocksize limit being treated as no more than an anti-DoS measure, and fees to discourage spam.
It works both ways of course. Some people must have been discouraged by seeing these centralized adjustments instead of a self-regulating system arising. Either way, this is undoubtedly what we had till now, evidenced by Core developers complaining about all this leading to a messy situation.


Will it be enough, though? Seems to me that Bitcoin is going to need much more than small blocks to get mining more decentralized, and it is unclear how essential small blocks are in this process.
More concrete evidence and better rhetoric is desirable for all sides obviously.
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:41:26
Well I already said it is hindsight bias from our perspective. There is no way around it, so I added my anecdotal record. Maybe it is not as good as your wild guess?
If someone achieves positive energy using magnetic confinement fusion using a moderately sized tokamak tomorrow, would you say that it was "imminent"? How about if it happens 20 years from now? Will it have been imminent then?
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:54:45
If you want a mature response...
The exchange rate stability (or lack thereof) is a chicken-and-egg problem. Bitcoin has to gain more use even with price volatility in order to dampen and eventually get rid of it.
It will be a painful struggle, and people suddenly investing and divesting doesn't help. Bitcoin is currently more suitable for people that expicitly want it to succeed, and unfortunately also nutty speculators.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:01:39
It shows me how such debates will be used to spread distrust in the viability of the system.
My trust in it would suffer if the public impression of the debate itself became a factor. We don't want politicians running the show.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:23:25
I've seen some bashing on Hacker News before, and to be frank the linked thread does not seem to be one of them. Couple items look like buttcoin type misinformation, but they've been properly responded to.

No, full nodes don't serve these light clients (Electrum, Mycelium, MyTrezor, etc.). They need additional server software, which create their own latencies. What you are talking about is probably SPV (BitcoinJ, etc.).


I guess this is the core of my initial query. Am I harming the network if I can't catch up fast enough, but uploading plenty on average?
@_date: 2015-07-04 02:52:39
As far as I can recall, Neo&amp;Bee would offer easy conversion and pegging (a la BitReserve), mult-sig physical (paper?) wallets and whatnot. Not really revolutionary, but also not super useless.
It's fortunate that it exploded before the clueless CEO guy received any customer funds, so only investors got burnt. If the failure was not preceded by a TV ad bombardment, news articles, etc., it wouldn't be such a humongous fiasco. Absurd in every way.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:40:02
Do you have any policy recommendations for those who don't follow the events closely? Should we increase minrelaytxfee? Some wallets don't let people to set fees, so I'm a bit worried.
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:44:19
Bitcoin Wallet, doesn't rely on third parties, and also has the option to connect directly to your own Bitcoin node (for privacy, reliability, etc.).

It seems it happens when a post mostly attracts voters of one sort of opinion. If you follow the subreddit, you get exposed to both "camp"s. Everything that doesn't appeal to either camp (i.e. interesting/original stuff) always remain at single votes down below though. :-)
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:18:07
Apologies for the label. Nonetheless, I think what I said applies to such ridicule, too. At best, it fuels the division.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:32:26
With this level of rhetorical prowess, "small block" camp has almost zero chance of capturing peoples' imagination. On the other hand, having any doubt about big blocks gets you voted down pretty quickly, ridiculed, etc. so "big block" camp has no chance of convincing people who prefer to get informed first.
We are not really debating, just observing common disorders haunting the geek mind.

Even the wisest person may be influenced by others with proven merit. The effects may not be always beneficial, but let's reserve the word "regulation" for when there is a controlling authority.
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:31:33
I couldn't think of other terms, sorry.
By "casual node", I mean those people run just to support the network or for their own personal use. In this case, latency requirements would likely vary.
By "wallet server", I mean machines who also serve to light clients (Electrum, Obelisk, proprietary services, etc.).
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:25:19
Quite the contrary, this merely shows that voting is completely pointless. People will be faced with everything they are willing to put up with.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:31:31
Those who use MyTrezor service, yes.
They have to wait, or switch to a proper wallet that supports Trezor. My recommendation would be switching regardless, as you will get more features (like labels, better coin selection, better connection, optional multi-sig, etc.) and sometimes better privacy (especially if you initialize your Trezor off-line).
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:27:26
Looks like it, though I'll feel better when we get more blocks on the valid chain.
(edit: Valid chain caught up. Wow, that was fast...)

What makes this hard fork so special? Bitcoin Core is the de facto standard implementation. If it specified a protocol change with little political implications, I would expect it to achieve near-complete support.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:15:13
Today, the second highest I remember is [here]( though it was removed before the one you mentioned.
I'll look for a better example.

Yes, I'm sure it's the reason they exited a bit before shit hit the fan. My designated sentinel for the next time.
