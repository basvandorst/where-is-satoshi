I’ve still been using the computer so that’s a concern.... and I’ll look into a recovery place but I’m not optimistic about that
I’m pretty sure I do or at least every now and then I’ll get a notification from time machine telling me the computer hasn’t been backed up in x days

Sorry accidentally replied below 
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:35:56
It did and I really thought that was the way to do it.. I promise I’m feeling dumb
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:37:22
Will it really be that simple though? Is there anything I can do if the balance still reads 0?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:34:00
Hi!!! OP just here to say thank you a combined effort of all your advice both tech wise and patience paid off and I found my wallet!!! Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:20:27
Considering I don’t know what that is, I doubt it.. I did this all on a Mac also 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:40:13
Well..... fuck
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:25:42
I dragged the bitcoin core wallet over the hard drive, tested it by opening it up and everything, then I ejected it and wiped the computer for the most part 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:01:29
I was wondering how this situation worked out for you OP I was just considering sending my BTC at the lowest fee
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:35:07
I’m still syncing with my external drive right now, so I can’t check my original disk but I don’t see anything like that on here. There’s a wallet.dab but I’m thinking that may have just showed up once I reopened the app because all of the dates and times are for today... will the syncing work it out or am I SOL?

I fucking agree i don't understand why we aren't giving this China thing the amount of attention the market is giving it. No one gives a shit about J.P. Morgan's opinions on bitcoin. It's time to just bail out 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:39:00
I have no idea and """neither did they""". But it was 100% due to wells fargo, any time I tried to connect my bank account to my coinbase wallet the account was immediately closed and I was told to transfer whatever bitcoins I had to an external wallet. I even tried using different e-mails, whatever I could, but literally the second it connected I was forced to shut it down. So I switched to chase, got a new email, and said fuck you to coinbase. Maybe I shouldnt blame wells fargo outright for it, but it would be extremely unsurprising to me if they had an issue with their customers using coinbase, and there's not really another explanation I've been able to uncover.

Been having a similar problem- I saw it usually takes about 8 days so HODL lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:13:53
I'm a broke college kid dealing in small incriments, but sold $100 worth at 3,260 :( I didn't HODL well... hoping to rebuy when it hits the 2,000s
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:38:33
You gonna stay in now? I'm trying to decide the same thing 
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:59:10
I'm switching from coinbase to gemini because coinbase keeps inexplicably closing my accounts before I even make any transactions. I had to "empty my wallet" first with a new address, so I sent my remaining bitcoins over to my gemini address. They still haven't showed up in my wallet though.... I was wondering if anyone knows how long this process should take or did coinbase just fuck me over and take my money. wtf do i do
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:22:19
I'm in college so I'm buying up bits in small increments too. Wait for another significant dip and buy in then. At least that's my plan!
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:36:09
Do you think it's worth staying in then? I'm someone with only a few hundred dollars worth in
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:22:37
wellllllll  which one of these do i even want to do, on gemini
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:34:21
What does this mean? Sorry still a noob if you don't mind. I literally just opened an account with chase JUST to have bitcoin because Wells Fargo wasn't even letting me open an account w coinbase 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:23:13
I appreciate that, I just don't really have THAT much. I don't even have a full coin. I'm only 21 and I left money in back in 2014 and when I came back it had blown up so I figured why not try putting some in. My plans haven't been to sell and trade just to buy bits at dips and hoard for years, I don't know if that puts me on the same playing field as the majority of the ppl on this sub
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:24:22
Also I'm in TX too so what's up represent. I had been using coinbase but just fuck them for so many different reasons, so I've switched to Gemini but a keep a small amount in coinbase just so I can watch the market and stuff more closely on the mobile app since Gemini doesn't have one 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:51:06
You cash out too? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:38:09
Has china ever gone this far before? Genuinely asking 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:56:49
Yeah *maybe*, or not, either way, doesn't it seem best to wait until the exchanges close?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:21:56
So can I just leave my coins on Gemini and be fine? Same as usual? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:22:37
wellllllll  which one of these do i even want to do, on gemini
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:59:41
Upvoted for profanity 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:24:00
So what I'm going to lose all those coins unless..?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:16:42
I'm having such a hard time deciding if it's time for me to cash out, I just can't tell
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:38:15
I went ahead and downloaded bitcore and I'm planning on moving all of my coins in there.. sorry if this is dumb, but my coins will still grow in value with the market while they sit in the wallet right? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:51:06
You cash out too? 
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:50:29
I first put money in bitcoin when I was about 14, I'm 20 now and not only am I friggin' thrilled with the way such a small amount of money exploded, but I've put a little more in too. Definitely, though, since people like you and I are young, it's important that we not put TOO much in. Look at it this way, it's better to have lost $200 trying to make a million than all of what you've made so far for nothing

@_date: 2017-09-08 01:37:29
I've had bad experiences with coinbase for years honestly. And they're impossible to get in touch with and so vague. So I'm really glad to hear that
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:56:49

And suddenly, I'll never sell my bitcoins throughout the history of time. I didn't think to consider the numbers in that way to be honest, and yeah I've definitely been word of mouthing the fuck out of them. It's just weird defending this thing that's obviously so versatile and shady but also not shady at all and completely transparent in all the right ways so it's just. Well, you know. Classic bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:48:13
No that makes complete sense and sounds like what I should've been doing from the beginning. I went ahead and downloaded Bitcoin Core wallet and ill move all my BTC in there. They'll stll appreciate with market value correct?
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:25:23
The support links for coinbase will never help you unfortuantely. They're all automated and bred to be vague. I would really recommend switching to Gemini if you can (I did just a few days ago and I'm already way happier) 
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:31:38
I'm having this same problem using Wells Fargo. I made a couple transactions and now my bitcoin account is shut down and every account I try to open after that linked to this WF account shuts down automatically...
