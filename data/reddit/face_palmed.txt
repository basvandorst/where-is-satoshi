but ltc code is the most similar to btc. its much easier for people to make the addition if they accept btc. eth is a different beast altogether. but btc using ltc to push its own advancement is hardly a negative or a challenge. if you look at their roadmap, they might prove a lot of the btc stuff before hand. personally i find this great, because it means my btc can keep growing while ltc works shit out. then i can send my btc through atomic swaps and kill companies like shape shift middle manning me. not that i think shape shift i wrong for doing that. but why do we need all these exchanges, when you can build that shit INTO the coin itself.

anytime you NEED something, you're in a bad situation. It would be nice if btc has these features for the user and that is why LTC is adding them. if they get success. I'm sure btc will follow suit. Too much capital on BTC to not take a conservative path toward innovation.

you look at it as one or the other. I look at it as both. Crypto users are flexible to use all crypto. not just one. bad mentality. sets yourtself up for war of crpyto instead of improving the overall experience to the end user. good seemless experience and all of your holding appreciate, but more importantly the cryptos fiat war gains traction.

but he also didn't premine the coin and is hiding. so that is a double edged fact. also LTC has had a chance to distribute out to the masses since its creation. There really are a lot of positives to this relationship between ltc/btc. I think it makes both stronger.

wow, actually a strong point against what i believe. nice argument honestly. But how do you prevent ltc from being a better user experience if they are willing to make these changes faster? if the user experience is better on ltc, or any other coin for that matter, why wouldn't you use it as a user and not a shareholder?

sure a 100% move. but do you really keep all of your savings in one fiat?
