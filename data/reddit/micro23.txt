So what your saying is that ALL this information is false right?
He didnt live and party directly with these guys also his best friends? 
If your not willing to open your eyes then I guess you could say he is completely innocent.

I got banged .25 cent fee's on many many test transactions. Unfortunatley you pay high fees on small transactions. 
Let not even count the fact that every time I buy bitcoin I pay a coinbase fee on top of that. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:07:00
Right?  I wonder  what affect this will have.  Should be an interesting day I'm thinking this will help stability.

I'm confused. 
1. I will sell them to you on localbitcoin for 9% over coinbase. I have seen as low as 6-7%
2. Why dont you just use coinbase? They are not shady and American owned. 
3. Why not use a trusted seller/escrow service and purchase them online?
4. Buy them from a friend or local person on craigslist or a tech club.

So if I'm running windows or mac I dont have to worry about this right? 
It seems this is only a Linux issue no? Should I be worried if I have my coins stored on exchanges or places like coinbase? Are they affected?

I'm using BitWallet and it's fantastic as well. Give it a shot. Also has printing, key control etc...

I met Jim Lowry at Inside Bitcoins NYC. He was happy to take 5 minutes to explain Storj to me and we were just sitting next to each other at a talk. He seems super excited about it and I will say there were many people in the Bitcoin space excited to talk to him.
Goodluck Jim!

Do you see any way to make small transactions ($3 or less) especially transactions under a $1 have less or no fees? 
Is there any way to have these transactions lets say under the $5 threshold picked up faster so that we can buy coffee or do small transactions instantly?
I understand the wait of a minute or more(sometimes up to an hour) for bigger transactions but what about some sort of method to make smaller transactions instant?
I'm thinking vending machines, quick transactions etc...
I would also love to show people how bitcoin works with $1 sending it around from place to place but it just gets eaten up so fast in fees. 
Why cant people with small hashing power (antminers) and GPU's take over all the small transactions? 
PART 2
Do you see the Blockchain as a solution to the double spending problem of Concert and Event tickets? It would be nice to use the Blockchain to verify use and validity of tickets.

When my wife's cousin who was only 16 was diagnosed with a incredibly rare childhood brain tumor the Ronald McDonald house put him and our family up free of charge for days, fed him and gave him a brand new Nintendo DS and 3 games to keep. They also let our family use the kitchen to prepare home cooked meals. The place is homey and an incredible thing for families in a really bad spot and time. We did not use the Albany facility but another fantastic RMD house. 
After that day I have donated what I can every single time I see the chance to the fund. I also tell the cashier at McDonalds how amazing the RMD house is and I incredibly appreciative I was every time she asks for people to donate.  Also like to tell them it's for a charity that actually works.

When I pay cash the price is the same. So what fees am I paying? Please explain. If I pay bitcoin the price is the same PLUS the FEES. So it actually more to pay with Bitcoin then the credit card and I get no cash back at 1-5%. Explain that.... There are only fees if the credit price is more then the cash price. If the cash and credit price are the same the price is not charged for using a credit card. Almost everywhere I shop I actually save money by using my credit card instead of cash by getting that 1-5%. 
Sure anywhere I can get a discount paying with Bitcoin of course I will. I want to pay with Bitcoin anyways!
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:03:13

I'm trying to backup like it says in the instructions but it does not seem to be possible. Am I missing something? Might want to update your site. 
Great job otherwise! Looks really nice.
Also does not seem to work on Android. 
You need to give people the option to use Barcode or Barcode Scan as an option as well. I dont want to install yet a third barcode scanner.

The theory is that it's not for US customers. People in Australia and Brazil pay these insane fees/taxes on stuff like this. I believe by paying with bitcoin and shipping this way they can cut out all the fees/taxes.

People know exactly what they are getting into when they use your site. You should not feel bad at all. Any casino in vegas would have taken this guy for all he is worth and not thought a second about it. 
If you walk into a casino or you try your hand at gambling you should know what your in for. 
Fortunes are made and lost at the tables. Unfortunately people always look for someone ELSE to blame when they are the ones that lose it all. 
IF you cant stop yourself from making life changing decisions with your money then you should not be gambling end of story. Only gamble what you can AFFORD TO LOSE. 
Do you think the dealer at the roulette table would have stopped this man? God damn right he wouldn't.

What am I lying about? I have a free account. If I need money I can go to any of about 9 atm's in my town for free withdrawal. I literally have had my account for 10 years and never paid $1. 
I dont write checks and when I did the free 20 checks I got when I opened my free account. 
I can also go to the bank instead of going to the atm if I need cash which also has no fees. 
I can also cash my check at the bank and get cash with no fees. 
Sure I have used an atm 1-2 times in an emergency but honestly I was not counting that $1 fee both times I was out of the country and took out money at a casino to gamble. So You are right to my bank directly I have paid about $2 in 10 years. 
Otherwise I NEVER use the ATM.

Nope didn't think you were being a dick. The cost of doing business with cash and credit for me is pretty much 0 here in the states. The only thing I am charged more for is Gas if I use credit. I have used my credit card for $1 purchases many many times.

To be honest everyone loves this guy but his videos really arent that great. It almost seems like he should plan it out a little better. At first I thought they were great, but I already know what he is trying to say. If I was new I would not be half as impressed.

I kinda understood most of this I just dont understand how there isnt a solution in place for small transactions. When I saw the fee's were 5X the actual amount I was sending I was really blown away...
So what is the sweet spot for sending? Is there a chart that shows the fees on X$ amounts? A calculator anywhere?

I have a folder in my dropbox with fake files. That way if anyone takes them they get nothing. In this case he zipped the folder and deleted it from my dropbox. First I saw the zip upload and hit all my other computers/devices then I saw him delete the folder and files after he copied them to himself. 
Hopefully they find this, think they got me and leave. In this case, it might have actually worked. But either way there was no bitcoin on the server.

I would use this feature if they remove the 1% fee and bank fee. It's just not worth it on purchases under $20 great idea tho. Also it should show the price you're buying it back at and the total.

Honestly here is what I have been doing in the last few months. 
Moving money from Coinbase to localbitcoins to blockchain to btce to mycelium to my hotwallet and cold wallet. 
Paying for items.
Running a bunch of test transactions to test my iphone bitcoin wallets.
Running a bunch of test transactions to and from bitcoin paper wallets. 
Sending bitcoin to friends and family. 
Donating bitcoin.
Testing my ecommerce plugins for my website.
Tested multiple bitcoin software wallets, multibit, qt, electrum, armory.
Tested multiple online wallets, blockchain, localbitcoins, moolah, prelude, bitstamp, btce. 
Turning bitcoin into other cryptos. 
Investing in bitcoin startups like Safecoin.
Donating to random people or developers.
Buying services from fiverr.com
So honestly I have made tons and tons of transactions and some of them I paid .25 fees because I was doing them to small apparently. When you look at it in the end those fees really start adding up.

Have you seen the community? Have you seen what they accomplish? Have you seen an altcoin besides litecoin that can bounceback like this?
I'm not saying put your money in it, I'm saying it's a fun active coin with potential as a tipping or small use coin. It's also a great starter crypto for people to get in.

Retail prices do not include a 3% fee. If I pay in cash or I pay in Bitcoin it's the same price. If I pay in credit it's the same price. So where is the 3% fee? Oh your saying they are marking EVERYTHING up for all payment processes 3% then thats not a fee for using one method. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:45:13
Good work on starting damage control. I really hope you had nothing to do with this otherwise your looking at some serious charges man.

I'm just worried if BIP-38 ever becomes compromised someone could write a script to easily clean out all the wallets they ever made. 
I use mine as my secure hot wallet. More money then my hot wallet but not enough that if it was lost I would jump off a bridge.

"we keep 90something percent in cold storage" Hey boys... Time to lower that to 80something because your loosing money..... People wanna buy coins! I also feel like it kinda hurts Bitcoin as a whole. We would be seeing much stronger buy support if this didnt happen. 
At the same time, I reloaded and got a SICK price on coins. I LOVE YOU COINBASE!!!!
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:42:41
I stopped using blockchain.info when they added the send to email feature I used it and the coins never arrived. When I contacted customer support they said "sorry we cant verify you sent the money" when I used their website to send it. At that point I said I will never be back again. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:48:53
You just completely contradicted yourself twice man. 
"Only because merchants are barred by the processors from giving a cash discount or for showing you the processing fees."
"No, if you pay BTC, you see the fees that merchants are required to hide from you when you pay with a card!"
"Merchants CANNOT discount the prices when not using cards or they will lose their ability to process cards."
"Some merchants give BTC discounts"

This is my feeling as well. With 1-5% cashback why would I wanna PAY 1% to do transactions. 
I know everyone keeps saying use bitcoin it's cheaper, but it's not and with rewards i pay 1-5% less. 
Dont say that they add it in fees or other hidden things. I DONT PAY FEES. 
If I walked into a store today and paid with credit card i get 1-5% back and no fees. If I use coinbase I pay 1% fee and get no discount or cashback. 
Now dont get me wrong I still pay with bitcoin, I buy novelty items and support things when i see them. But it always ends up costing me more money to pay with bitcoin unless they are running a promotion or a special where you pay less or get a discount for paying with bitcoin. 
My latest idea was to make all my  bitcoin purchases on my credit card using circle then use that bitcoin to pay and buy gyft gift cards then double dip on rewards/discounts. Unfortunately it's $10 per transaction or 3% if over $10. That blew that idea down quick.

After the 1% fee it ends up being a 2% discount when you pay with bitcoin, which is still not that bad.

@_date: 2015-01-26 06:37:47
I just made a thread about this too. I checked chase freedom and discover it both cards were cash advance. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:11:05
Hey thanks. I didnt know that. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:15:32
I checked with Chase freedom and Discover IT and they both said they would charge it as a cash advance. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:13:49
That's what I figured. Had to ask. $50 is the magic price point. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:18:31
I emailed the dev and also tried to hit him up on social media but he seems to be inactive. On a positive note there was only $500 in there this morning and there is over $1000 at this moment ;) So something is working. Just hope more people dont start exploiting it before he closes the loophole or he is in trouble.  Also he didnt stop like you may have thought, he changed his script and is adding in more payout addresses so it's hard to find him. 
This guy is pretty clever. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:44:17

@_date: 2015-01-16 04:42:58
Yeah this is the main reason I was using Mycelium. The built in feature is sweet. They call it "cold storage" so thats why I have been saying cold storage. 
I know cold storage means long term paper or offline and once used is no longer "cold". 
I got burnt with change address one of the first times I was sending around coins years ago. I sure wish they fix that for people so they dont lose their coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:34:26

I suppose if i was using it for all my legit purchases I shouldn't mind. I keep a nice aluminum card in my wallet with $100 average bitcoin on it so i can make small purchases. 
Thanks for your input. I do see how if I was to do transactions it would be super easy to trace as it always sends the funds back and it's always reused.

Thats why I use bip encrypted keys for my cold storage. I keep a printout at work. My house and keep one on my person on my crypto card. 
Nobody is ever getting my password it's totally random and thats actually stored in different places.
Even if someone gets my backups they dont have the ability to get my coins.

Mycelium is fantastic and the new ui/version is coming soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:01:10
I am in the same boat. I have other methods of storage that work for me. I carry a cryptocard with bip and use mycelium to spend from cold storage. 
As long as there is no flaw in spending from cold storage I should be safe.
$75 is my price for a Trezor.  
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:31:02
These should be 5 packs for $10. That would be my price point. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:12:21
For that reason I only send my coins to my wallet to fund trades when they are initiated. 
As soon as the meeting is confirmed I fund the coins. The reason I started doing this was because I kept getting burned by guys in my area making fake trade requests and locking up tons of my coins in escrow for 24 hours. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:09:42

It's bip-38 encrypted. I would love for someone who really knows to chime in and say if/how much more safe i am using a bip-38 encrypted key for my cards I carry in my wallet. When I wanna spend I open the app scan the code type my pw and spend. 
This way I dont have to have my phone with me, I can use any device I know is safe. Also I can just print out my pub and private keys and keep copies at home work and safe box. No need to worry cause they can't be accessed without the pw. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:41:47
I'm only trying to find out because I would like to use a card that has no fees. We can argue wether it's a loan or not but honestly I dont care. I just want a card that does not charge the fee. I always pay my bill so it's only effects me if it's treated as a cash advance.

Also can you make it so on the dashboard page I can only see 2 instead of 4? Also how do you choose which ones are shown?
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:07:57
I was thinking the seller would know his public key and your public key, they pass their own key to each other and then encrypt using that combined number. Then only you two would know the key. A third party would have to intercept both public address's to get the key. Which I suppose you could do but it would be pretty hard to find out each persons public make the decoding key and then intercept traffic. But then all they would have to do is add a number before between and after the keys or some little algorithm on top of that and it would be pretty impossible to guess. Then again, they would have to leave this out of the "open source" part no?
Or am I totally 100% wrong? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:15:36

It's not Circle charging the fee, I'm totally fine with the 3% it's the cash advance fee's from the Credit card company I'm trying to avoid. I want it to go thru as a regular credit card charge as if it were merchandise. Right now it's treated like a charge at a casino and treated as a cash advance which has insane fees.

The Ronald Mcdonald House. 
It's a freaking AMAZING charity. I can vouch myself for and absolutely incredible help they provided during a terrible family loss.

@_date: 2017-03-26 16:10:13
So it's not  visible on the order book ,
But it's still there that way someone has to have the coins on the book before it goes thru? 
So the benefit is it ensures that you don't pay the fees the problem is it doesn't show on the orderbook?
Why wouldn't I choose this every time instead of a limit order? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:41:10

Can you even sell bitcoins person to person in NY legally anymore? I stopped a few months ago when it started getting sketchy. I also had police roll up on me and ask questions. I was not feeling very comfortable so I stopped. 
To clarify they were asking me questions because they saw two people meet and make a cash transaction and assumed I was selling drugs. They were actually pretty cool once they realized this was obviously not what was happening. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:08:59

The price is always so low at BTC-E but unfortunately, it's too expensive to wire international money to them. I live in the US. 
The spread was over $50 between them and US exchanges the other day. I was wondering why nobody was just buying there and selling here, but then I realized how expensive it is just to get USD onto their platform. 
Anyone have any recommendations? 
Also, why isn't the big boys with $$$ buying up the spread from BTC-E and local exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:21:18

These fees are brutal $100 spread no thanks. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:46:37
I had the exact problem the other day, here is what you are going to do to fix it. You are going to intentionally double spend. Export the private key and import it into another wallet. Once you do that you will have the full balance. Just resend the transaction with a higher fee this time. Since it will get picked up first (due to higher fee) it will negate the first spend. 
Be careful!

Man. What a bummer. I really feel like I have to stop using it now. Might move over to breadwallet. Thought about giving airbitz a shot but I wish they had just a wallet not all the social media and extra features.  Why oh why does breadwallet not let me set the default unit to just Bitcoin. I dont want bitz, milibitz :(

You guys should figure out how to list the 5% off before you checkout. It does not let you know until after you checkout.

Wow thats way more then I thought. I was going to get a pack but couldn't find anywhere the page count listed. I was guessing only 10 pages. 48 is fantastic. I might have to get a pack...

Fiverr.com $5 takes Bitcoin. They just made a website and charge more. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:14:15
Thats a good point I guess. If they had a wallet on the applestore and they stole peoples keys and funds would you think we would have some recourse?

I'm in NY. For me it's the fact that every time I try to touch, sell, talk about it I am hit with awful regulations or people who make comments im getting pretty tired of. Everyone thinks they are a comedian and has a joke about bitcoin and to be honest after a few years im tired of trying to explain it to people. 
I just dont feel any reason to come here that often anymore because there is not much content on here worth reading.

Heard about you on Twitter from  Paul Puey. He was raving about your service. Also, I have had contact with your customer service! Not only did you respond on twitter right away, you even followed up and tipped me a coffee to boot.
The product is great, what beats saving money?
I actually wrote you a email and gave you some suggestions. One of them was to figure out a way to use your service for people who clean/clear their cookies often. I also think that the option to donate less then lets say .20 cents to the pool would be a nice option. Then you can take that money and directly use it to offer bigger discounts. I mean I dont need 3-10 cents change and would be happy to donate that back to the "fold pool"
I'm not sure you need to inspire trust. Once you use your service for the first time it's quite easy to see how simple and effective it is. 
Keep doing the great job you are and I'm sure you will be expanding and kicking ass in no time. Good luck guys!

People like you are awesome. Sometimes this is how people first get into bitcoin.

I'm on page 35 and I cant even believe what I'm seeing. If it's really this bad, how corrupt is the rest of the system? I mean just think of all the cash.... 
Jesus. This is scary.

You also have to do it for the next issue. It charges shipping for previous issues.

Out of curiosity why would you choose Bitgo? 
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:32:54
$20 on 1000? Thats terrible man. Put that into a IRA or something. I'm getting 14% returns this year already. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:51:58
Fantastic. Hopefully more vendors start using this. Bitpay is my favorite so far for payment processing. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:31:06
It's absolutely infuriating. Glad this post is getting some legs.
Not only that but how come in the app I cant paste a god damn address or scan it and see the blockchain history on it? I would love that damn feature. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:05:44
In my opinion  is by far the easiest to use, setup and understand. They are really onto something. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:46:33
And the new direction is.........?

Fantastic. Thats nice guys.

This is one of my only current complaints with wallets. Max spend/send should always be an option. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:28:02
Thanks. I appreciate the response. That was the impression I was under.

Are you guys still charging fees to use your wallet? If so don't you think you should list that somewhere before you download it?
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:54:03
The cool things I have...
    
**Tshirt only $10 quality is beyond excellent for $10 I have black and red both look great.**
    
**Bitcoin Dice**

Lots of people saying here how Cantons website isnt safe and paper wallets are insecure. 
Whats the story with this? Is his site safe? What about paper wallets?

I also want to point out that their generic rounds are absolutely beautiful. You should definitely check them out if you have not. The price and detail simply cant be beat.   
My bitcoin transaction with them went fine and delivery was quick.  Quick easy and less then the CC price.

I remember meeting the team at Inside NYC Bitcoins and wow you guys have come a long way. Congratulations.

Fantastic. I was just talking about when you download it it does not show. I'm not sure where you got that page but its not on the download link. I just clicked right on the website and downloaded without ever seeing it. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:44:39
I was told it's insured up to 100k. Then I found this. If I used the vault and something happens, this has to mean they are responsible and insured no?
*Section 5.1 of the User Agreement says that "Coinbase holds all customers' USD Wallet funds in a dedicated account at an FDIC-insured financial institution." Is this "dedicated account" a type of account that is covered by FDIC insurance ( and are the funds within the account within the FDIC coverage limits ( In other words, are USD Wallet funds insured by the FDIC, which goes beyond being in a dedicated account at an FDIC-insured financial institution.*
