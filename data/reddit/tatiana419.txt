I regret so much that when I first heard about it I thought it was a stupid scam and now it is doing so much better and I can't even invest because we are not able to.. I should have followed my gut!

If I have more BTC I will absolutely purchase things from EBay, I mean when I have more money/BTC cause we are poor right now.

You're amazing thank you for this information.

Because I wouldn't mind getting a deposit, it actually worked out quite well for me...that's why...

I've been researching on how to make some bitcoin besides buying/selling.  If you find that please post!
I wish I would have invested on some when we first heard about it.  Head smack every time I think about it...

It's to promote bits and it's fun I have given and received!  
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:14:58

Thanks so much for the info.  
I just read on JP Morgan Chase being one of the biggest opposers of BTC.  
I'm trying to buy not sell.

@_date: 2014-05-10 11:05:35
Yup every single day.  Do you have a life other than trolling? 
You're entertaining, keep this going..

If that's what you consider begging then yup you probably should...
