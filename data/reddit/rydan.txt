Kind of hard to report a theft when your money was likely illegal in the first place.

So in other words, "two weeks".

Sounds like the insurer knew something.

Phishers purposely use misspellings to lure in victims.  Blockchain uses incompetency to lure in Bitcoiners.  It is very effective.

If you keep reporting these Apple will just decide it isn't worth having any.  Then they'll all be banned again.
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:44:38
Um, yeah that is way too much work for the $99 per year developer fee.  How about no research at all and just replace with Apple Pay?
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:20:58
Prove it.  Let's all withdraw everything at the same time.  If it fails we will hunt you down and throw you in jail for fraud.  If it succeeds then your business continues on as normal.  Just name a time.

Don't do it, BFX.  If they won't judge you, I will.

Just a reminder that only coins in the vault are insured on Coinbase and Xapo owns its insurer.

That is also theft.

Have they added that State sponsored backdoor yet?  That might be why.
@_date: 2016-08-28 23:26:40
Ask BitPay to eat the transaction.  They accepted the funds and they told you you had funds.  This is all on them.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:43:39
So you mean you are insolvent?  Great job.  Time to withdraw everything you can while you can.

But they gave you what you paid for.  You bought Microsoft Points.  You didn't buy an XBox Live subscription.  If I go to Walmart and hand the cashier $300 for a gift card I don't get upset when they hand me a gift card instead of handing me an XBox.

Try donating $3k via separate transactions and report back to us.
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:18:49
I'm just surprised it is so cheap. If there are only 200 of these they should be worth millions each at a minimum.  To put that in perspective there are 21M BTC each worth just over $500 but these cards are over 100000 times rarer.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:29:26
And while we are at it why don't we increase the block reward back to 50 BTC?  The problem is that the fewer BTC miners receive the longer we can rewind the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-05 09:30:38


That's exactly what they  were doing though.

OK, that's fine then.
@_date: 2016-08-02 08:44:31
Basically the guy in this picture is head of the one and only legitimate Bitcoin business.  Unfortunately he gambled on a stupid altcoin and lost badly likely causing his company to be forced into bankruptcy in the next few months.  The real issue is he needs to sell off everybody's BTC to buy that altcoin but since BTC is dropping in price and that altcoin is jumping in price the risk of insolvency is getting out of hand.  He's trying to convince people to that alt doesn't exist (since the war is over and BTC won apparently) and trying to get the BTC price to recover.

So basically Youtube.  Just like Youtube, Facebook will remove users who get too many reports against them.

Why?  Why does buying 40 items require several CS contacts?  I've bought several hundred things (wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't over 1000) from eBay in the past 14 years yet I've only contacted their support 3 times.  Online commerce is not supposed to have friction.  If I wanted to talk to a person I'd walk over to Walmart.

I once paid eBay over $100 to list an item for 7 days.  PayPal was required for this particular item (an unlocked iPhone) so I had the listing setup to only accept PayPal and to require payment immediately.  PayPal limits my account the next day due to making too many sales (I had a 5+ year history of sales at this point) blocking all incoming payments so nobody can buy my item.  eBay refused to end the listing or refund me my listing fees since my problem was with PayPal and not them.  They literally got paid $100 to show my potential buyers an error page.
@_date: 2016-04-06 08:43:24
eBay is almost always cheaper than Amazon.  A big reason for this is their slightly lower fees but also because random people list unwanted goods on eBay while Amazon is almost entirely made up of professional sellers who have actual margins.  The problem is that people don't know how to search the site, see the top listing which isn't hte cheapest, and leave.

I did the same with Cryptsy once.  It was a year+ old scam site.  Fortunately I used a random password for that exchange since I didn't trust them and I used 2FA so it didn't matter anyway (scammers weren't smart enough to fake that back then).  Went back and changed my password.  A few months later I cashed out.  Lo and behold Cryptsy was hacked and lost everything a few months after that so my lack of trust was warranted.

I don't think you understand how stocks work.
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:46:41
A recovering stock only means the company did better than expected previously.  Stocks are about expected future performance.  So a stock will get slammed if it is believed that the company will be worse off in the future.  Then when they show it won't be as bad as previously believed it will recover somewhat.

In a few years there will be a financial crunch in the bitcoin space and the solution will be a simple return all the inactive and missing coins back into play.

Back in 2001 my credit union showed a $500 charge from some specific check number.  I couldn't think of what it was so I pulled out my checkbook to find the check was still there.  I scanned it and sent it to them via email.  A few days later I got a call saying they accidentally transposed two digits on one person's checks so it matched my account.  Then I was reimbursed a few weeks later.  The problem though is this brought me below my $500 minimum balance required for free checking.  So at the end of the month I got charged $5.  So I went to the credit union myself and asked them to reimburse.  They argued with me but eventually gave me the $5 credit.  The next month I was charged $5 again because the previous $5 fee I was erroneously charged put me under the $500 required balance.  At that point I gave up.

All you can prove is that money was sent somewhere by someone at sometime in the past.  You may be able to prove ownership of the sending address but not guaranteed since you probably use Coinbase as your wallet.  What you can't prove is that T-mobile owns the address you sent to.  Maybe you did send your money to T-mobile.  Maybe some Chrome extension rewrote the bitcoin address and you sent it to a random person.  Or maybe T-mobile has a glitch in their software where they don't persist every single receiving address they've ever generated since they started accepting bitcoin and they simply have no knowledge they got your money.  A credit card or bank account resolves all of those situations very elegantly.

You can get exactly the same result with fewer hashes.  If everybody agreed to gradually shut off 90% of their miners the results would be the same.  If someone attacks then use what is necessary to secure the network.  As far as I can tell nobody is attacking it right now.

Zero-conf is when you send out a transaction that is signed but it hasn't yet been put in a block.  Many clients and businesses consider zero-conf good enough because people are good and won't steal.  If all the nodes in the world dropped your transaction from memory then it would be like the transaction never existed.  Similarly you can send another transaction and if it finds its way to a miner the miner can choose which is the real transaction and confirm one over the other so the other transaction never existed.  For whatever reason miners are expected to only confirm the first transaction that was sent despite the fact there is no way to create a total ordering of transactions based on when they were originally created (a fundamental problem in distributed systems).  RBF explicitly tells the miners to confirm the most expensive transaction.  So you can send as many transactions as you want to whoever you want and only the one with the highest fee is the real one.  This means zero-conf is not safe at all.  It does mean if someone steals your coins and they haven't been confirmed yet you can resend it all as a fee so the thief gets nothing.

Reddit user unaffected too.  But can we really trust voat to be telling the truth about their PayPal account?  They are a website that has no marketing gimmick other than to be where people go when some controversy happens.  At some point you just start lying and making up controversy.
Edit:  Now that I can actually visit voat again this is the text:


So basically they went over an arbitrary limit that PayPal imposes for everyone's protection.  This is normal.  Their account isn't suspended.  They just want verification of who is receiving all this money all of a sudden.  If they didn't do this then someone could make millions in sales and run away with all the money leaving PayPal to hold the bag and chargeback fees.  Any business that cares about it reputation would do this.  Bitcoin doesn't care about its reputation and you see how well that has worked out so far.

No.  See if we go with 20MB they can't handle 20MB.  That means there will be two separate viable forks.  One will be 20MB.  The other will be 1MB or 8MB.  Most people here would probably commit to 20MB.  They can't afford to let that happen.  So they will 51% it forcing everyone to switch to the smaller fork.  They will also promise not to do this to the smaller fork since it is to their benefit to play nice on it.

It would be terrible because it means you'd be taxed on profits when the value goes up and could claim loses when it goes down.  This is on your holdings.  This means forced sales or you have to keep paying the government more and more money just to keep your current holdings.  And you'd have to declare your holdings every year if you have above a certain amount.  On the other hand there'd be no capital gains taxes when you buy and sell so you could use it as a currency.

Stop spreading FUD.  As we've discussed many times here people will not double spend on a coffee purchase.  The reason is simple.  People see you double spend and they'll stop transacting with you and possibly call the police.  You might as well just write bad checks in person and see how far that gets you.  That's how you get a picture of yourself plastered up on the store's wall.  The only people this impacts are online merchants who ship a product (physical or digital) upon 0 conf.  So digital downloads.  These are the same people who are already at the mercy of PayPal and merchant accounts.  This adds no marginal risk to them.

I counted all the 1* and 2* reviews and all the 4* and 5* reviews.  The interesting thing is that if you look at the ratio of verified purchases the 4* and 5* reviews are twice as likely to be from people who actually bought the book.  Keep this in mind when choosing which reviews to believe.

They never tried nor failed.  They just fired the guy the previous CEO hired to do it.  And as far as I know all he did was write a javascript implementation of bitcoin core which had absolutely nothing to do with Reddit Notes.  So at the end of the day Reddit promised to give 10% of its money to Reddit users, got a lot of free publicity over it, then reneged when Ellen Pao came to power.  I assume she got the 10% instead probably in exchange for not suing Reddit for something.

They can set their own limits.  But if I can spend 1 ms more to collect a penny I'm going to.  The problem with bigger blocks is you can have 20x more transactions before you need to even begin increasing the fees to incentivize miners to pick your transaction over someone else's.  This means more work for less pay in the shortrun.  It will take an enormous amount of time for us to see them paid fairly.  This is especially true now that we have things like bloom filters that speed up the processing.

You probably weren't around back then but back in the 90s (and for the entire sum of human history before that) information was very difficult to come by.  For instance you might watch a TV show when you were a kid, remember something vague about it, and wonder for 5 - 10 years what that was.  Or maybe you'd play a PC game and get stuck.  Well you'd get stuck there forever with no idea what to do next.  There was no way to find out.  Then one day you'd be at a restaurant and overhear someone mention it.  If you weren't there at just the right time you missed it forever wondering the answer to your question.  The internet changed that.

Maybe it makes verification too complicated.  Right now with 1MB blocks we know if a block is 1.1MB it is invalid and we won't consider it.  If we up it to 8MB after a certain block height we can still easily determine if this is a valid block or not.  But if it is dynamic we have to keep a running tally of the size of every single block and then look backwards and verify whether it fits a specific formula or not.

[Here's why you are wrong](
If you think we'll reach the 8MB cap in 12 months then guess what?  We'll be hitting in the 20MB cap in out of space in 17 months.  You aren't improving the situation at all by going directly to 20MB.  This isn't the solution you think it is.  Maybe we should just go with 1GB blocks instead since that will at least give us nearly 4 years.  Or maybe if we leave everything at 1MB we can come up with a real solution that doesn't involve tearing apart the network.

That doesn't happen.  They return the funds 180 days later and close your account by law.
And why would PayPal do that anyway?  They get a nearly 3% cut.  If you are making $10k per month they'd just have to wait 3 years to get the same cash from you but then they'd have recurring revenue on top of that.  Multiply that out millions of times and it makes for very good business to not steal from your customers.

Seriously 5 months.  That isn't even long even to put the next block size to a vote.  32MB gives you 3 months more than 20MB gets you.  So if you go with 32MB you might have enough time to figure out the next size to agree on but it is unlikely at the rate things are going.  You guys aren't solving anything with any of these numbers.  The only number that makes any real sense is actually 1GB which gives you nearly 4 years to figure out a real solution.

Thing is it won't work.  A mesh net means you have a ton of hops just to even get to the ISP instead of the one you normally have.  Every hop is easily 50ms minimum and I'm not exaggerating when I say that because I've measured it before with a repeater.  And that doesn't even take into account the bandwidth being used that will slow things down further.

1.  You steal a credit card or find one on the street.
2.  You find someone on Purse.io who wants to buy bitcoins.
3.  You create a fake account on Amazon and buy them an item.
4.  Once the item is delivered you receive free bitcoins.
It is perfect because there is no way to trace the stolen credit card and its usage back to you.  Worst case is either the Amazon seller loses their item or the receiver loses their bitcoins.  In the past people had to rely on having an extra victim that played as a middleman forwarding cash to you for a cut of the proceeds.  Often they would catch on or keep the money.  This avoids the middleman.

One of their CS reps was here giving an AMA and he painted the company more or less just being a payments company that happens to be in Bitcoin rather than a Bitcoin company.

Back in the old eBay days eBay allowed you to use Escrow.com and told you to never use anybody else.

Haven't you people ever thought that maybe the people pumping Bitcoin and those deriding it are actually the same group?  Who really has the most to gain from Bitcoin?  It isn't you or me.

The fix is incredibly simple.  Contact your sentator and tell them to pass a law requiring all businesses accepting Bitcoin (e.g. BitPay, Coinbase, etc) to not convert from Bitcoin to fiat for one week.  Make it illegal to do otherwise.  That will remove the downward pressure temporarily but also encourage companies to not sell at all reversing the trend.

I'm sure BitPay has good intentions but I may need to remind you guys about a company called NetZero.  Back as the Internet was starting to really take off and ISPs were scrambling to get a foot off the ground NetZero decided to try their hand at free internet.  They claimed they were not only the "Leaders of the FREE World" but that NetZero would always be free.  Well, a few years later they became one of the most expensive dial-up internet providers and their free option is such a joke it might as well not even exist because it borders on false advertising. They still charge me $8 per year for unencrypted (I seriously mean unencrypted, there's no SSL or TLS on their pop servers) 1GB of email because I know I'd lose contact with certain family members forever if I dropped this email.
The point is everybody compares Bitcoin to the Internet and now we are seeing companies adopting the same business models.  Will we see the same thing happen to BitPay?  Only time will tell but I'm guessing overwhelming legal costs are going to come into play at some point.

Also people seem to forget but as time goes to infinity the number of coins in existence drops to 0 since all bitcoin coins will eventually end up inside wallets that have no known private keys.

No, no, no.  Instead just tell the software to quit scanning the folder with the blockchain in it.  Just don't install any viruses in there and you'll be OK.

That's just another problem with OpenBazaar.

Bitcoin fluctuations are not deducible.  Bitcoin isn't a currency.  It is a commodity.

Despite his name he isn't really a billionaire.  The fact is when you invest or short in anything you put yourself at considerable risk even if you are right in the end.  For instance look at FNMA.  If in October 2005 I realized that housing can't keep accelerating and there must be a collapse then the obvious thing is I should short that stock like crazy.  And if you look at the price today I could have made over 100x my investment.  But the problem is the stock went up nearly 50% at one point.  That would bankrupt the average person.  Your average billionaire can wait these things out and profit regardless of which direction it goes.  Same with Bitcoin.  That thing is crazy.

It won't stifle it.  You people just thought it was a currency.  It isn't.  Just because you can trade it for something doesn't make it one.  What this will do instead is make it so people treat it properly.  No more spending it on lame tips or coffee driving the prices down.  Now people will hold it for at least a year so they only have to pay a fraction of the taxes.  People will vote to keep capital gains taxes rather than abolish them.

You can and will be held legally responsible.  This is just another avenue for a very common scam you see all the time on eBay and Amazon.
1)  Post something for sale on eBay at a very low cost (too good to be true kind of deal).
2)  Buy item on Amazon with the eBay buyer's shipping address.
3)  Buyer receives goods and leaves positive feedback.
4)  Stolen card gets charged back and buyer gets reported to the police.
The other variation involves using a random person recruited on the internet via spam to receive the stolen items via mail and then ship them to the customer along with taking a portion of the cash for themselves and forwarding the rest via Western Union to the scammer.  Those people usually end up with jail time.

Of course they track the coins after.  Why do you think Charlie is in prison right now?  He didn't track the coins after their sale.  If I hand you a beer and you drive off and kill a bunch of people I am held responsible.  Why should it not be the same with money?

No, I don't think he is complaining about inflation.  Just money in general.  Think of it like a disease and then what he says makes sense.  It doesn't matter if you technically lost money.  You no longer have to worry about the money in the first place.

Uh, did you do something stupid and make a "gift" payment from your balance?  If so there's nothing you can do because that isn't covered.

Think about this for a moment.
You have a Coinbase account.  They have a Coinbase account.  When Humble Bundle gets your money it is already in USD.  When you repurchase you put USD into Coinbase.  So it looks like this to any rational outside observer:

At the end of the day it is about the customer experience.  You simply cannot provide the same level of customer experience with Bitcoin as you can with a credit card.

That isn't really a good argument though.  If you had ads in your comments you could have used the ad revenue to buy bitcoins that would have still appreciated in value the same but you'd probably have even more bitcoins.  You can't expect people to work for a few dollars per hour and then hope that those dollars will somehow grow into hundreds or thousands of dollars in the future by themselves.

When I first heard of Bitcoin it was a few dollars per coin.  I was literally starving and didn't have access to clean food.  Each meal was a gamble on whether I'd get sick or not.  And this was in America.  I wanted to mine bitcoins but couldn't afford anything.  If my computer broke that would have been game over.  I ultimately got out of that and am now rich (no thanks to Bitcoin and only because of things I'd already done before getting myself into that situation that finally paid off).  There is a vast difference in what someone can do when you are a 1%er (which I am now) compared to living in poverty.  For instance I can now spend $100k and turn that into $50k of recurring income per year with only a little effort.  Anyone who thinks everybody has an equal footing is privileged to the point of complete blindness.

Because the market always wins the bitcoin banks would essentially give you a rebate every year that increases gradually.  And if you are lucky they might even be paying you in those final years.

And of course everyone in the Doge community was throwing their resumes at them just to be a part of it.  Normally such a person would have been laughed out of or if he'd posted there instead.  The founder just got lucky at one point and be able to toss around money to seem legit.

Yeah.  That's the problem.  Imagine I run a restaurant and some guy shows up one day.  He brings me a few dozen new customers per day and he has some scheme that involves him subsidizing their meals (why he does it is anyone's guess).  But all the people he brings in steal my stuff, try to steal my stuff, and just create a mess.  So while I have more customers (and supposedly more revenue) I now need to hire extra security.

The rules state $600 per year and then you do need to file a 1099.  Why is this still a problem for you?  Because you don't know who you hired.

The OP may have been mistaken in that email like he was mistaken in every email where he mentions wiring $25k instead of $20k or that it uses Windows XP as opposed to Windows 7.  But more importantly he doesn't say he worked on it, he says the issue has been resolved.  Whatever that was they may not have needed the unit in their possession to know the solution to the issue.

That's probably because they want to retain 100% equity so they can give it away to real VCs later.  For now they just want you just buy stickers and ATMs from them.  Today's startups don't need to give away equity at the outset.  They just need a cool page with a video to sell trinkets from.

One time I got a phone call asking me to verify some transactions.  Turns out my credit card had been compromised and over $9000 worth of stuff had been fraudulently purchased.

Edit:  Since I'm getting downvoted I guess you people think people are going to be buying Bitcoins in order to spend on Black Friday.  That is just dumb.  Nobody is going to go through all those steps of acquiring Bitcoins just to save 5 - 10% off something when they can get the same discount elsewhere with a credit card.  The only people buying with Bitcoin are those who already have it.  Hence the sales pressure and no buy pressure.  Last year we were in the middle of a bubble so this effect was hidden.

People obviously didn't read the article and even the OP is editorializing. If you actually read it there were anti-fraud measures implemented on the cards that activated when he tried to pay for his drinks.  This is a common issue with cards but this is to the merchant's favor because they wouldn't want to be stuck with the bill when the chargebacks come rolling in.  If he had only used Bitcoin this wouldn't have been a problem because the Nightclub would have just taken his stolen money without batting an eye.
Here's your choice and the real story:
1)  Take cards and miss a few customers to protect you from possible chargebacks.
2)  Take Bitcoin and possibly commit a crime by accepting stolen merchandise.

No you don't.  In the past 30 days you received 4 feedbacks totaling $156.  If we take the lowest average participation rate of 30% that means your sales are no more than $520 during the busiest time of the year.  And if you are paying the highest final value fees on your listings that comes to $78 dollars per month.  Now if any of your customers gets on the phone and calls eBay over some bitcoin related purchase that went sour your contribution to eBay's bottom line will have been negative in less than 3 hours.  I expect you'll be suspended within 2 days.

Private keys have no value but what it gives you access to is taxable.  Otherwise you'd have rich people burying treasure in their backyards and then giving ownership of the key to unlock the chest in their will.

It is worth it to companies like TigerDirect.  I'm not particularly a fan of such business models and they are often a big mistake that companies make because they only get premium users who pay and those premium users end up being a bit too premium.  As a more extreme example I've seen companies offer $10 per month plans as their premium and free to all and then end up with customers who have hundreds of employees tearing down their service.  Eventually something buckles and then everybody is paying fees (see PayPal for a prime example of this).

My bank always says something like "domestic wire" but I do know PayPal has charged my customers who had a negative balance with PayPal the amount necessary to make them whole but then told my customer that the payment all went to me.

No.  That's not how companies do stuff.  They have something called A/B testing.  They show a small percentage bits.  Another small percentage sees BTC and the remainder sees BTC.

No it isn't. Most banks don't charge a fee for their own banks.  And most credit unions form a sort of cartel that have all agreed to not charge each other's customers.  But if you are using someone else's ATM and your bank doesn't offer to pay your fees on your behalf you will pay a fee to the owner of the ATM.  I think the typical fee is like $2.  I have never paid a fee to use an ATM and I've had a bank account for 14 years.
Now a Bitcoin ATM will take an hour and charge you 7%.  But I'm sure that guy on Twitter knows this.

You either have a poor memory or you are very young.  Oil prices reached their all time high as the recession was gaining ground.  A price level that they have never even come close to since.  People don't wake up one day and declare we are in a recession.  The recession goes on then people realize it quarters later when it is obvious to everyone.  It was only after the recession was beginning to have brutal effects on our economy that oil started to decline.  I will grant you that the fall was about the same speed.  The difference is we aren't in a recession this time.

Satoshi isn't good.  The reason is it takes 3 syllables.  "Dollar" is two.  "Bitcoin" is two.  There is actually a known law that frequency of use increases exponentially with the shorter a word is.

No it wouldn't.  If Amazon's margin is 1 - 2% I can guarantee that their rate from credit cards is less than 2%.  You can get better than 2% for most credit cards simply by being a legit retail merchant.  So you are looking at less than 2% gain by accepting Bitcoin but the huge overhead of implementing the system and (get this) accepting Bitcoin through a third party like Bitpay or Coinbase which charge processing fees.
Also, Amazon has been profitable in the past.  You can't lose money for 15 years in a row and still be in business.

Blockchain.info just increased one of their security parameters from 10 to 5000 in response to someone documenting it as being one of the causes of the hacks.  They had a low number because they didn't want to inconvenience people essentially making their wallet software more popular at the expense of you getting hacked later after you are a loyal Blockchain customer.

My personal information gets sold?  Really?  Ok, let's say Mastercard makes all their money from selling your data.  How does bitcoin prevent that from happening?  I already have a Mastercard so my data is already gone.  But more to point I just bought something.  Are you saying that the merchant that I just bought from doesn't have any identifying information on me?  If they don't where did they send my product to?  Physical places aren't allowed to collect your data when you use a credit card in person so I don't really understand what you are getting at.
And I don't have to pay it off when I'm done?  How is that a convenience?  The fact that I can query up all my purchases over a period of a month and then make a single payment towards it while earning interest on my cash is a major convenience.

Most people seem to be under the impression this would never happen because there is no profit as the price would tank (as mentioned in the video) but then everybody touts Bitcoin is antifragile and nothing can stop it.  So really even under a 51% attack as long as the attacker plays nice (i.e. takes all the block reward but lets transactions go through) there is no reason to believe the price would do anything except flash crash and recover.  I would say without adding any plan to deal with it now means we will one day fall into this situation and the network will be held hostage from change.  You change the rules to something they don't want and they'll crash it all leaving them with permanent control.

Or they could be lying.  I'm going to be really frank here.  In business it is extremely common to lie about your membership numbers.  I developed an app 5 years ago (in fact the 5th year anniversary is this Sunday).  After two years it had around 2000 users.  About 1700 free and 300 paid.  Another competing app launched.  They did so bad in comparison to me they resorted to just being completely free.  And it got so bad they just exited the market and relaunched on their own website.  At the time they switched to their website was proudly proclaiming that 5000 users trusted them with their service.  The thing is their numbers were readily visible in the marketplace they just exited.  They had 300 free users.  They lied to look like they were the market leader.  And the sad thing is that it works.  Within a year they wrecked the businesses of several of their users.

This is similar to the Timothy McVeigh case.  They tried him for murder of the federal agents but not for the civilians even though there were a lot more of them.  The reason being they can always bring forth those charges if something goes wrong in the other trial.
Ross will be tried for these eventually unless they can some how manage a few decades (which I don't think is even allowable) at his sentencing for money laundering.  The quickest way to get him tried for attempted murder is to nullify the jury in this case.

A lot of ordinary things we take for granted are though.  For instance pensions are all necessarily scams.  You can't have a company run for hundreds of years accumulating liabilities that they have to pay out to non-working former employees for the rest of their lives.

I didn't really think of it in terms of blocks.  This means that there is an interesting avenue of attack.  If you take out the hash rate of the top miners you can bring confirmations to a near standstill and the slower the confirmations are the slower it is to actually fix.  If pools are replaced with manufacturers (e.g. Knc) there is noone available to replace them immediately since it would require designing and building your own miners at a massive farm scale.  We may get stuck in a weird situation where it takes several hours for each block which mean a year or more to fix.  Considering the government just took out BFL with relative ease it wouldn't be difficult at all for world governments to effectively shut down Bitcoin in such a scenario.

This is correct.  However I have heard a few random accounts of people claiming they had a dispute and proved it with the blockchain with PayPal ruling in their favor.  I believe these people are lying or the buyer was a serial scammer and PayPal had enough of it giving a rare ruling to the seller who then misinterpreted the reason.

Your argument is still flawed though.  With credit cards in order to use them (at least online) you need two things.  You need the name of the cardholder (public) and the credit card number (private, sort of).  With Bitcoin you just need one piece of information.

It does.  They didn't add "BPay".  They simply tossed out a method you obviously weren't going to use.  This is neutral at best.  For me though it clearly says Amazon which is fine.

Western Union is not predatory.   You are sending money that a person must process, verify your identity, and then hand you the money.  All the while keeping the place open for 8 - 12 hours.  You pay a fee because there is a person there.  With Bitcoin there isn't a person which makes it a lot cheaper (assuming just BTC -&gt; BTC and all other hops are ignored) but that comes with its own problems that we hear about daily here.

It even describes what the number is for and is the entire point of the application.  The only restriction is that it must be an integer greater than 1 (I don't even mention that part).  One user subscribed, went through the walkthrough, and then freaked out because the application was too "complex" and it would ruin her online store because she couldn't figure it out.

I just left Windows on the system.  I don't have much use for it but I do have some games on Steam that aren't Linux compatible yet and may one day want to play them.  Also 8.1 and the EFI setup the laptop came with work surprisingly well for just installing Ubuntu in addition to the existing Windows install.  I've always had to struggle to keep both installed in the past.  In the past I always had to wipe the disk, install Windows on a different partition and then install Linux afterwards since installing Windows last would ruin everything.  This time it was as simple as shrinking the Windows partition and installing Ubuntu with manual partitioning.

In the US you are allowed 3 transactions per month on a savings account.  Usually you can use them like checking accounts up to that limit.

Don't worry about pools.  It is KnC you should be worrying about.  Soon individual private companies will control mining and do as they see fit.  And there isn't anything you can do about it because their hardware will be 100 - 1000x faster than yours and yours will slowly decay into dust while they keep making more.

It is actually guaranteed.  The problem is USD really does inflate.  So even if Bitcoin fails miserably (and there's still a good chance that will happen) and drops to pennies in value over time that inflation will eventually make a bitcoin $10k.

This is actually impossible.  If the price of Bitcoin were to "constantly" rise people would catch on to this, put all their money into it, and then cause it to shoot up.

There is a site called Reddit metrics that tracks subscriber growth.  It was basically what Reddit recently did adding trending subreddits to their frontpage but predates that by years.  If you have bots subscribe to a subreddit it will show up there as trending and get posted to their subreddit basically giving it free advertising and maybe encourage others to join and buy bitcoins.  That's all.

It really depends.  In the US you are 100% protected from libel with truth.  Of course running an internet casino is also illegal so they obviously aren't in the US.  In the UK where the casino is based you absolutely can be sued for libel even if what you say is truthful.  UK has some of the worst defamation laws in the world.  If you say something that purposely hurts the reputation of another person or business you can be successfully sued even if it is true.  If the OP is in the US he is actually protected by American law (2010 Speech Act) because UK laws are so atrocious.

Nope.  Wouldn't have happened.  If we got the same OP and then Jordan retorted with a series of emails that showed the OP blackmailing him for money the end result would have been the same.  There is simply no way to prove those hypothetical threats are real short of a signed GPG email so the onus of proving innocence is always on the business in question.  Then add a few others doing the same and a pattern is established despite none of them being true.  Even if the OP somehow lost in the eyes of the public he'd lose nothing for trying as he would be essentially anonymous with no rep to lose.

Not exactly.  This kind of points as evidence to all those people that claim Bitcoin's price has no basis.  The price shot up for illegitimate reasons it also fell back down since then.  But the problem is people still remember that the market was once 1200 so a lot of people have it in their minds that this is the true value of Bitcoin or that it was legitimately that price before so it will obviously be higher again.  That keeps the current prices inflated.

Sorry but this guy has no clue about what he is talking about.  You don't sell in October to cover your 2013 taxes.  You sell in April at the latest because that's when your taxes are actually due.  If you haven't paid yet you are in a lot of trouble.  You also don't pay taxes on gains that haven't been realized.  You owe the government taxes on the actual value of your bitcoin at the time of acquisition if you mined in that year (meaning you are already in trouble).  You don't pay on the current value.  That would be the case if Bitcoin was a currency but it isn't.

Cloud mining is stupid.  You are expecting someone to print you money for less money.  But on top of that you have to trust that hardware that is notorious for being delayed actually exists and is plentiful.  One company was offering to mine on your behalf what represents 1/3 of the entire network.  But even if it does exist there is zero incentive to offer cloud mining over mining yourself unless you know that mining will not be profitable.  This is completely different than funding the R&amp;D plus manufacture of mining equipment which can be legit (though strangely it almost never seems to be either).

Um, yeah.  If I run a business I'm not going to stop swiping cards just because you have an iPhone.  In fact I'm probably not even going to bother setting up to work with the iPhone anyway because it is too expensive of an upgrade for something that yields no benefit at all to me.  Also PayPal has had this for years.  I paid just the other day with the PayPal app at a fast food place and got a $5 discount.  All I had to do was swipe on the phone and show the phone to the clerk so they could verify the photo on the phone looked like me.

Circle's business model is to hold bitcoin for free and use its appreciation as their profit (exactly what the NY regulations is trying to prevent from happening).  But Bitcoin is guaranteed to increase in value roughly 100x every year.  It is down nearly 50% since last year which means we are in for nearly 200x by December.  That means as long as no more than 99.50% of transactions are fraudulent Circle is guaranteed to at least break even over the next 6 months.

That's dumb.  That doesn't make my parents use Bitcoin.  All that does is create a taxable event for me (and I need as few of those as possible) and gives 2% to coinbase (1% going in and 1% coming out).  That's it.  Incidently that 2% that Coinbase makes on the transaction is approximately the same that PayPal makes.  The only difference is that the buyer is paying half the fee.  Congrats you just made a PayPal without the buyer protection.

No, you people are dumb.  Hold auction.  Everybody claims they were outbid (or rather that they lost but this subtle difference is lost in translation).

Show me where at any point the fourth party interacted with Brawker.  The brilliant thing is that these companies get hit by the scammers and they have no idea that it was Brawker that led them there.

Basically.  Android does not have quality controls in place.  But Apple does.  Since Apple unbanned bitcoin apps that means all the poor quality apps are now flooding Android driving out the good ones.  While the good ones are available on Apple.  So Apple's unban is effectively an Android ban.

I guess if you don't mind destroying the economy this works.  With the current banking system you put a dollar in a bank and the bank loans out 10 to someone who wants a home or start a business.  With Bitcoin you stick it in a wallet and if you are lucky you don't lose the private key.  That is $1 that is locked up and withdrawn from circulation even if only temporarily.  Nobody benefits from it.  The economy eventually breaks down and rioters fill the streets.

Now that I've had a chance to look over things I can tell you exactly what happened.  You launched 3 days ago.  The fact you expect people to just throw money at you is the problem.  You can't open a store and post a link expecting sales.  Ecommerce doesn't work that way.
You offer a two year warranty yet claim every sale is final.  If my product arrives damaged and I paid with Bitcoin what happens?  I can't return it without damage obviously.  What happens if I'm your only buyer and 18 months from now it dies?  Are you really going to fulfill your obligations?  Will you even still be in business?
I didn't check your prices but are they competitive?  How do you compare to eBay prices?  And if you are cheaper why not sell on eBay as well?

Yeah, I was offered this domain personally for $1.5M.  Suffice to say I didn't take it (couldn't really afford that anyway).  The domain has value in that it is instantly recognizable.  It also has a lot of value in that you can put up a page asking for personal info and everybody from will just willingly submit it since btc.com must be something amazing they want to be the part of first (this was already done and no telling how many email addresses the original owner got simply saying, "something amazing coming soon".

No, when you hoard a bitcoin you do everyone a disservice.  Your storing of value does absolutely nothing for anyone.  Nobody is benefiting from that and you are lucky if you even will.

No.  There are too many people using Bitcoin now.  Imagine I buy coins on Coinbase and Coinbase suddenly realizes all the coins they purchased with my money were on a different fork.  Hard forks are too risky.  The best we can do is if(block number &gt; x) use protocol 1.1 instead.

Not only that but every card that I'm aware of except the one from my credit union charges a much higher interest rate for cash advances, charges a fee of 3% or minimum of $25, and charges interest immediately with no grace period.  So that $10 might have cost $25.29 plus interest.

I'm not a member of your forum but is that all it takes to take over an account.  Just answer one question?  The problem is unless it is "what is my password?" the answer to this question is practically guaranteed to be orders of magnitude weaker than your password.  At which point we must ask the question, "Why bother having a password?".  Generally websites require three questions to be answered and then send a link to the email address on record.

What are you talking about?  They are charged 3% for credit cards.  Visa doesn't care what the money goes to.  The restaurant even has to pay 3% on the sales tax they are forced to collect.  That is seriously messed up.  So essentially they are charged 3% on upwards of 8% plus another 3% on top of 15 - 20%.  That comes out to around 0.8% of the total you just spent on food.  You say, "that's less than 1% and is outrageous."  But guess what?  The typical profit margin of a restaurant is 2% or less.  That means credit card fees account for a loss of nearly 1/3 of profits and these fees aren't even on the food.

Ah but I read here on that Bitcoin will have the unique ability to turn all merchants nice.  The reason is since they cannot be forced into giving refunds (no chargebacks available) negative reviews will rule over them.  Buyers will be more aware of these negative reviews and more liable to post them since they have no real protection otherwise.  Therefore, it is in the retailer's best interest to keep the customer happy and refund them 1:1.

Well if you are selling it for $10 you are guaranteed to be making less than $10.

Assuming you are paying minimum wage for your support staff you are now making less than $6.50 per product.

People say this is good for Bitcoin but don't you people realize the problem here?  If Russia makes Bitcoin their national currency (which they almost certainly will due to be removed from the SWIFT Banking Network) it will turn Bitcoin into the enemy.

Reminds me of the time someone from TUAW made an iPhone app (long before iPhone apps existed) that let you identify songs.  Within 24 hours the app was shutdown because you can't expect some random company to let you hijack their API with millions of requests for free.

How would the refund be any faster than a credit card refund?  They wouldn't have even charged you until they were in the process of shipping if you paid via a credit card meaning if you'd been in the same situation no refund would have been necessary.

They'd be stupid to confirm a charge for something that they are planning to refund because they'd still get stuck with a fee if they did.

2)  Nobody on eBay is verified with regards to anything unless eBay locks down your account as a seller in order to verify your sales.  The exception are people who pay $10 to eBay for a certain type of verification but nobody does this and I'm not even sure if the program still exists.

Your Nigerian friend is still a problem.  Maybe he stole those coins.  Do you still want to transact with him just because you won't get caught up in his scams?

It can't stay on your wallet forever.  If it did the money would be useless.


They won't.  eBay tried this with their feedback system and failed.  Amazon never bothered and always kept a stranglehold on their sellers.  Buyers have the money and they want whatever it is as cheap and fast as possible and they want it guaranteed.  If you say "oh, well we can't really guarantee you'll be satisfied or get your item" they'll blame you even if the reason it was so cheap is because it was an obvious scam.  Then they'll go elsewhere.

No.  PayPal charges 1% extra on cross border transactions.  Moolah and the OP are both in the UK.  Therefore he enjoys the normal rate for the UK which should be 2.9%.  But Moolah is swimming in money so it should be even cheaper.  Then again he isn't the paying the fees.  OP is so it will be 2.9%.

So a syndicate won.  It has been stated before that syndicates will necessarily bid under the market price because given the small number of coins each member gets they could easily get that at market price at any time they wish.  That means at most  4% went above market.

This is the problem with Bitcoin.  You have to actually ask people if a site is legitimate because you are too terrified to actually buy from them.

Yeah there is.  Coinbase costs at least 1%.  PayPal costs no more than 1.9% if you know what you are doing.  That is a savings of less than 1%.  You might claim that the fraud risk is less meaning you should still give a discount however telling someone they can use a safe (to the merchant) payment method for a discount vs an unsafe one that has tons of buyer protections is not proper customer service.  You might as well just put a banner on the website telling people they are all suspected thieves because that's exactly what your discount says.

Here's the problem none of you seem to understand.  Bitcoin allows for transaction ids to be changed.  That much everyone here seems to understand.  What isn't clear to any of you is that this is really a problem.  Anytime a business makes something complicated or something counter-intuitive it causes problems for its customers.  You can blame the customer all you want but the user experience is the business's problem not the users.  For instance if I design a piece of software that has a button which burns your house down when you click it it is my fault your house burned down if you click it regardless if I warned you beforehand.  Take responsibility and make it so this isn't possible and you won't get articles like these.

No.  That's not how it works.  People don't steal your credit card, use it, and then get your score ruined.  What they do is steal your identity and create new stealth cards using your information and ruin your credit that way.  They'll do things like take out bank loans, buy cars, cell phone contracts, etc.  If someone steals your card and uses it you'll get a call a few days later from your bank asking you if those charges are valid.  And if you say no, nothing happens to you except you get a new card.

The cost is virtually nothing.  You just need to convince people to join your pool.  The cost is simply the cost to run that pool and to advertise it.  There are 0 fee pools out there so it can be done.  And if you think people won't all join one pool because they realize this will happen (e.g. GHash) then you create two or three pools and pull away the curtains once you've assumed control.

That wouldn't work.  Does anyone seriously think Fox is going to let someone watch The Simpsons for $0.10?  They are on Hulu and I guarantee all those commercial interruptions add up to more than $0.10 whether you click on them or not.  They certainly aren't going to let it go for less and then still leave enough room for Netflix to make a profit on what is leftover.  Also doesn't it cost $0.10 to send via Bitcoin anyway?

Also Circle is extremely risky.  I don't think there is any difference between them and Neo &amp; Bee other than they are starting at the bottom rather than the top of the market and the owner isn't some guy that would sell out all the investors for a car.  Otherwise the business model is pretty much the same which is entirely dependent on Bitcoin only increasing in value.

The merchant loses.  Even the bank loses nothing.
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:36:35
It isn't savings.  They aren't giving you 6% because they save 6%+.  They are giving you 6% because they know Bitcoiners are crazy and just looking for an excuse to spend their bitcoins because it makes them think it makes their coins legit.  So Bitcoiners tend to buy a lot and overspend when they do.  All it takes is a tiny incentive and they can gain a substantial customer base with virtually no marketing spend.  For fiat most companies give 3 - 15% commission.  So this is just pennies on the dollar.  You are being taken advantage of and don't even see it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:06:33
People downvote me everytime I mention that within a year Bitcoin will be centralized.  Once you have 51% you have 100% as nobody else can mine and claim a reward.  I know if I took over the network even if only by accident the first thing I'd do is exclude all miners so everyone would join my pool.  You can resist but it is a losing battle.  GHash is then tasked with monetizing their prize but keeping the network safe from others who might try to take it away from them.  As long as they can convince everyone that this is all the harm they will do then I see no reason to not still use Bitcoin under that situation.

Bitcoin is so high priced though.  I know people say it is divisible but if you throw in $0.23 into a coinstar machine you'll only get 0.0003 Bitcoin and that assumes no fees.  The problem will get worse when Bitcoin is worth 100x what it is today in 12 months.

No, not this at all and I'll explain why.  You have the option to pay with a PayPal balance.  This can't be charged back either.  By your logic allowing people to send a PayPal balance is just as good as Bitcoin.  If I'm a scammer I'm not going to use Bitcoin but I'm going to use a credit card.

Here's the problem.  Apple has tens of billions of dollars in cash.  All of bitcoin is worth about 10 billion dollars.  Apple could just spend a fraction of their reserve and own all money.  In fact this would solve their tax problem where they can't bring the cash over to the US or pay huge taxes on the gains so it would probably even be a sound business decision.

The fact that WU has fees means nobody is going to be using WU to move money from one pocket to the other.
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:54:32


You know why that is?  It has nothing to do with trust.  It has everything to do with the fact that eBay will charge you 20% more, lower your search results, and then kick you off the site if you don't improve.  Now you are allowed 5% defects where a defect is anything out of the ordinary like giving a partial refund or cancelling a sale due to any reason that isn't a select few that involve a problem with the buyer.  That's the iron fist.  Before 2008 it barely mattered.  You got a negative, you negged your buyer, and that was that.  As long as you had 98% (and it was easy to do that) you were fine.


That's how eBay used to be.  Have you asked yourself why it isn't like that now?  Because it doesn't work.  If it worked eBay would have continued with that and would be figuratively printing money.
@_date: 2014-11-26 06:33:20
You guys really shouldn't have done anything at all.  Now people will think there was no real cost to obsessively creating WU posts and upvoting them.

People have a tendency to centralize.  If you don't present them something decentralized from the get go they'll pool their funds together and divide them later even when it is completely unnecessary.  Typically when I eat with friends one person will pay with their credit card for everyone and then everybody PayPal's them back.  Bitcoin doesn't really solve the problem it just puts you in a different mindset from the beginning so you don't think of doing stuff like that.

Technically from a fees perspective it makes sense for PayPal to accept bitcoins because they supposedly lose money every single time somebody pays with a credit card but make up for it when you pay with your bank account or from your existing balance.  However the problem is the money laundering and not being able to reverse.  Both of these are very bad for PayPal and will likely mean they'll never use them.

It took you four weeks because you are a suspicious person and they wanted to make sure he got his stuff.  You already violated eBay policy by asking the buyer if he would use Bitcoin so you've already shown yourself as untrustable to eBay/PayPal.  And yes with Bitcoin you wouldn't need to wait that long but your arbiter is going to want assurances your buyer received the goods before releasing so you really aren't in any better of a position.  And if you think they are going to take less than 3% you are crazy.  PayPal is automated and they demand 3%.  A human needs more just to put food on their table.

There would also be a blackmarket for these black listed coins.  They obviously wouldn't be worth the same as bitcoin but if you could buy them for 1/10 the price you can make a substantial profit conning someone into accepting them in place of the real thing.

I worked for a company that had an interesting glitch I fixed.  If you clicked the button at the end of the form there was a call to an external service.  Depending on what you had filled out this could take upwards of 20 seconds before it would time out (that was another issue altogether).  But some browsers won't wait 20 seconds, they'll just automatically repost without telling you.  The second submission was nearly instant since the service call would fail due to already being started.  But you could end up in a situation where everything was messed up in ways that didn't make sense depending on the timing of these two hits from the browser.

I'm not sure what the deal is but last September I upgraded from my original iPhone to an iPhone 5S and part of the setup process allowed me to set up my voicemail pin.  The weird part was that my 5S had no mobile account yet but I was able to use it to reach the voicemail settings of my original iPhone and set the pin as if it had never been previously set (I know it was set because I remember setting it up just before a job interview nearly 10 years ago).  After setting it up the original iPhone vibrated and received a text claiming my pin had been changed.  I'm on prepaid so there was no way for Tmobile to link the two iPhones together until the next day when I actually switched over.

This might be the case but it is extremely unlikely if eBay stored the hashed passwords properly.  I've seen Etsy members complain that they are still getting hacked after changing their passwords so I suspect Etsy is the one at fault.

It doesn't matter.  US is the biggest part of the market.  IRS has ruled it isn't a currency.  So transactions through bitcoin are relegated to people who are paying their taxes at a great cost per transaction (far better to just use credit cards), lawbreakers, or foreigners.  Focus on what brings value to bitcoin but this no longer does.

I commented about Bitcorn's comments on the Bitlicense yesterday calling his edits reasonable and pointing out the more reasonable ones.  It is currently sitting at -3 and wasn't even upvoted enough to make it controversial.  Then I got -12 for pointing out all the people predicting $10k and $1M Bitcoins in contrast to someone who said Bitcoin would drop to $200 this year.  The prevailing response was basically that predictions going up are speculation which is good and predictions going down are due to close mindedness and those people need to STFU.

This is precisely why people do trust their banks.  Banks are regulated for good reason.  And as a result we can trust them.  That being said I'd never trust my bank to hold more than $250k because the regulations start ending at that point.  Unless you are in the 0.5% or better odds are you don't have that much sitting in your account.


The point he is making is that the value of Bitcoin collapses.  Did you see the value of Bitcoin before Gox started playing games?  It was around $700.  Then they claimed they'd give an update by Monday.  When Monday came and they failed to offer any explanations Bitcoin dropped into the $400s briefly.  Note it has never rebounded into the $700s since.

Here's my problem with the article though.  I know 100% for a fact that if you asked the same questions to someone at eBay they wouldn't comment on policy violations.  I follow eBay very closely and have seen it time and again.  They won't discuss it.  They would also likely just point to their list of certified providers and state they aren't listed there.  You'd get a very precise but not really helpful answer.  And that's how it should be.  Otherwise you are breaching your customer's trust.  There was a guy on Reddit two years ago who worked for Amazon and he got fired for simply mentioning how to get around a bug on the Amazon site that was preventing people from buying a certain video game.

But what about that $20k non-secured loan you took out a few years ago?  What happens to it when you file bankruptcy?  What about the car that you'll no longer be able to make payments for?  And what about that job that requires you to have your own transportation?  Now you and your entire family is on welfare and supported by the state.

That doesn't sound like Apple at all.  Apple is all about the customer experience.

Here's why it won't work.
I'm a scamming buyer.  I buy your product.  I then create a new wallet.  I transfer Bitcoin to that new wallet.  I then file a complaint with eBay stating you didn't send the product.  You respond to eBay saying you didn't receive any money.  I show proof of payment in the blockchain.  Does eBay decide in my favor or yours?  eBay is buyer friendly and they have a rule right now where if you pay then eBay may refund you but they also have the right to take that money from the seller through any necessary means.  Usually that involves charging their credit card or withdrawing from their bank account. 
I'm a scamming seller.  You send me bitcoin to my wallet.  I'm a scammer so I fall off of the face of the Earth.  You file a case through eBay.  eBay tells you they can't locate me and I have no legitimate payment method on file since it turns out I used a hacked bank account and stolen credit card when joining.  Does eBay owe you a refund?  Or are you out of luck?  Well both of those cases are horrible because I guarantee in your mind you'll be thinking about how you **got scammed on eBay** rather than how you were stupid for paying via Bitcoin.
The only way Bitcoin will work on eBay is if an intermediary (i.e. PayPal) is used to hold the coins in Escrow.  Then you have gained absolutely nothing and there's a good chance the value of Bitcoin will dramatically change by the time you finish any disputes.
@_date: 2014-01-13 07:31:08
A chargeback indicates a problem.  Whether that is an unauthorized payment or a poor experience.  Either way even if you eliminated chargebacks PayPal doesn't want the buyer to be upset and identify PayPal as the source of that.  Bitcoin's lack of chargebacks do not solve that problem.

Considering everyone else is all positive about this revolutionary idea maybe I don't understand it.  From the OP's description it sounds like you send some random company on the internet $50 and later when you withdraw you'll have $50.  Isn't that a bank?  Point A sounds exactly like PayPal and sending money as a gift.  Point B really isn't any different than buying from Coinbase and then sending your bitcoins to another address.  But most of all the whole concept sounds like they make their money by running as a fractional reserve.  Isn't that the same thing that people keep demanding exchanges not do?

2)  If you want into you must pay a nominal amount in Bitcoin (not some altcoin).  If people complain that someone is making money off this or whatever just point it to a bit eater address.
3)  Include your Reddit id the payment.
4)  Comment away.
5)  If you troll your permission gets revoked.
Since people are paying money to post we are guaranteed a healthy self-regulated forum.  Nobody is going to pay money or go through all those hoops just to make a one-time joke.
And before someone says people come here to learn about Bitcoin that's how you teach them.  Create a how to guide from purchasing your first Bitcoin to making your first transaction.  Your prize at the end is the ability to be here.

Because when you declare it will just be gold 2.0 (essentially becoming somewhat valueable and usurping gold's role as a commodity) pitchforks come out and you get downvoted to the bottom by both factions.

They aren't going to get a partial packet or a corrupted packet.  But what I'm thinking could happen is the browser accepts certain inputs, then returns you to another URL where your browser (possibly by just simply hitting that URL) send them more data.

That makes no sense.  How often do people subscribe to Cable and then chargeback the next month?  Probably close to never.

Considering everything can be represented by a computer this means everything can be reduced to binary.  This further means that that everything can be represented as a simple yes or no where one is accurate and one is obviously inaccurate.

Not really necessary.  This is what you do to make a fortune.  Post an ad somewhere saying that you are buying private keys from used wallets that contained at least some amount of coin in them at some time.  Of course any reasonable person will just create a new wallet, drop their coins into the new one, and then sell their old wallet to you thinking you are some kind of sucker since you can't possibly gain anything from doing this.  You then go back to your present time and wait for your wallets to fill up over the next few years and drain them at will.

Here's the problem.  He's a whale.  He wants to sell but he needs plausible deniability.  If you knew 100% that a whale with over 130k BTC was about to unload them to some random person on the internet would you be confident the price is going to hold?  One guy crashed Bitcoin's price with just 3000 BTC less than two months ago.  He doesn't want to create a panic possibly costing him several million dollars.  It also isn't fair to his buyer either.  By verifying his ownership of the coins he would be committing financial suicide and taking you with him.

I'm guessing it is the hope that every early entrepreneur believes in when they start their new venture.  They research the marketplace which has billions or trillions of income per year.  Then they compute 1% of that and this becomes how much their idea is immediately worth because that would be crazy doing all that work and not even getting 1% of the market.  Then they make 1% of that their annual salary (cause that really isn't much when you think about it) and instantly become a millionaire CEO.  A few years later they still have around 10 users because they don't know anything about marketing or development.

I wasn't following Bitcoin closely but I knew about it.  In April 2013 I saw an online ad from BFL for one of their ASIC miners and even read an online review from a mainstream media website (don't recall which one) talking about how they made a few hundred dollars in less than week.  I figured if I bought one now it would arrive by my vacation in August and I could leave it running while I was vacation.  Since I'm rich I figured I'd buy the $15k model.
Then I did some investigation and realized these ASIC miners aren't actually new and had been on preorder for several months.  Based on the extremely positive review I read I figured once they did release I'd be at the end of the line, all the coins would be mined crashing the market, and I'd have an expensive paperweight.  So I didn't order.
So I didn't lose anything and I'm really glad I never bought into it even if part of that was due to ignorance on how Bitcoin worked at the time.  And as a bonus my apartment didn't burn down while I was away for 3 weeks.

It really sounds a lot like the dot-com bubble times again and I think it is because everyone investing was in elementary school when that happened and doesn't really understand what it was like back then.
I run a successful company that profits at least $400k per year, produces more value than most of those companies, and I know it isn't worth anything even approaching the market caps they have.  It is just nuts and a lot of people are going to left out of pocket in the end.

Sometimes banks change the rules.  I opened an account with Wells Fargo back in 2005 because it was literally in my backyard.  They gave me an option.  I could have a completely free checking account that did nothing except hold my money.  Completely free, no fees, but not even a checkbook either.  They asked me if I was sure because it seemed odd I'd want a checking account without checks and I could get a free checkbook if I simply agreed to pay $5 per month.  I told them no.  Six years later they sent me a statement showing I had a $0 balance because they decided to start imposing a fee on everybody and now my account is empty.  I currently have around $160k with another bank instead and they actually pay me to store my money.

If you have a company that is publicly traded and they give you shares as compensation you pay ordinary income tax on the market value on the date they vest.  Then when you sell you pay capital gains on the difference (or assume a capital loss on the difference).  There is nothing special regarding the way the IRS is handling bitcoin.

So I gave them 3 ones and the problem was solved.

Depends on how you market it.  Apple doesn't own "i".  In fact most of the times they don't even own the very trademark of the product they are launching.  They didn't own iPhone (Cisco did) and they didn't own iPad (another company did).  Then again Apple sues everybody over these sort of issues even when they shouldn't be able to win.  They even trademarked Airdrop despite an app in the app store already being called this for years and when reached for comment about it they said they weren't sure yet if they would pursue a legal case against the lone developer over it or not.  I mean they were actually thinking about suing a guy over something they did to him after he paid them a yearly fee for a few years simply because they liked the name of his product.

One of two things both lead to the same final result:
There was a taxable event when you got your shares so you have short term capital gains and also short term capital loses.  These offset each other so you have $4000 capital loss.  Of which you can only claim up to $3000 in one year and roll over the remaining $1000 the next year.
Or you did not have a taxable event when you got your shares.  Your short term capital loses are $4000 of which you can claim $3000 for the year and $1000 the next year.

I don't know how it is in New Zealand but in the US minors are given free reign regarding financial transactions except in cases of food.  For instance you could go on localbitcoins, buy bitcoins from someone, and then if the price ever goes down you can legal return the bitcoins to the original seller for a 100% refund.  In my business I purposely don't deal with minors ever and most companies are the same.

Listen, I know you are trying to spread Bitcoin awareness but people like you aren't welcome on a site like eBay.  eBay has its hands full with scamming sellers and they deal with the issue effectively by forcing everyone to sell through approved payment methods (e.g. PayPal).  When you offer to accept payment via Bitcoin you know your buyer can't do anything about it and are at the mercy of you being a good seller.  eBay doesn't want to deal with that possibility and cancels your listing before you can do damage to their reputation.  Nobody on Amazon is offering payment via Bitcoin for exactly the same reason.

As I've stated before if people really want to fix this issue just throw money at the miners.  GHash is 0 fees.  If you want people to switch not only can they not get cheaper than that but they lose the size advantage.  You must compensate them to make it worth it to them.  Some early adopter out there with a lot to lose needs to create a negative fees mining pool and the problem will solve itself.

OKCoin obviously had no idea what they were doing or agreeing to from the start.


If you have a brilliant website you can turn that into about $60 per day.  In order to increase this to $40k per month that site would need a whopping 60k visitors per day every day.  And that is if you can get top advertising dollars.  Most sites make about 10% of this number per visit raising this to a need for 600k visitors per day.  Because of this I would say the contract written with ill-intent and very one sided.  Any reasonable court would throw it out on that grounds alone.
There are ways around the above like charging people exorbitant rates to advertise.  But that is essentially scamming them because you know there is no way they are going to get any positive ROI on that.  Not that I wouldn't expect Roger Ver to do that.

No, a significant percentage will go to the news headline at the top of the search which right now claims future regulation is going to stifle Microsoft's plans, people are pumping for 2015, and extortionists are targeting Bitcoiners.  Basically a bunch of drama but not too bad.  But it is typically much worse.
Then you have the top hit which is bitcoin.org.  I don't remember the exact numbers but it is something like 80% click the top link and 5% click the third.  Nobody ever clicks on anything beyond the third link.  Google may as well only ever return 3 results but if they did nobody would trust them.  The problem is the  link is Wikipedia.  I don't know if this is always the case but whenever I see Wikipedia I click it and skip everything else.  In fact I was probably looking for the Wikipedia anyway.

Not really.  Here's the problem and we saw this on eBay years ago when buyers could get negative feedback.  By only using BTC you can't actually punish scammers.  They get their money either way.  The absolute best you can do is tell someone like Yelp that you got ripped off.  That's all your recourse.  It might impact business but only somewhat.  But in a fiat world their payment receiving choices would be limited.  Once they got too many complaints via PayPal they'd lose PayPal.  Then they'd move on to a credit card processor.  They'd lose them too.  Eventually they'd run out of processors and their business is toast.  This encourages them to at least play fairly with you.  This drives up their costs.  Trustworthy merchants are then not required to slit their own throats chasing your money.  But in Bitcoin world everybody is equal because everybody takes Bitcoin.  As a result trustworthy merchants must rely on third party reputation services and failing that (and most won't bother checking) throw away profits by lowering their prices to compete against the scammers.

Happened to my dad.  He got scammed and lost everything.  The very last thing that happened though was the scammer gave a check to his ex-wife (who actually a very honest person and my dad's friend), she cashed it, and then she paid my dad what was originally owed to him.  Then the original check was no good so rather than fall on the sword herself she cancelled the check on my dad.  He couldn't pay back the bank and was forced into bankruptcy.  His name remained on the chex system and he couldn't even be associated with anyone who had a bank account as a result.

Raising the price is not difficult.  The reason the price goes down is because people are willing to sell at that price.  Simply don't sell.  If everybody agreed that Bitcoin was worth $10k and refused to sell below that it would be worth $10k.  Don't sell below $10k and you are guaranteed that price.  You say, "but others are going to sell for less than $10k."  Don't do business with those people.  If you see a coin that was bought or sold for less than $10k don't acknowledge that coin.  That coin doesn't exist.

That includes the escrow and wire fees.  With bitcoin I'd have to locate some neutral third party to act as Escrow for mutli-sig.  Pay them probably 1 - 2%.

Plus being the government they could just print the very $1000 bill they pay with meaning we all actually pay in the end.
If they really want to protest just make it 28.8k and permanent until net neutrality is restored.  That's the fee the government would then have to pay.

It isn't necessary against their "long term" interests.  See if you take over the network you'll damage the coin but not necessarily in the long run.  Bitcoin is anti-fragile.  Two or three days later the price will begin to skyrocket for no rational reason.  Now you've got a valuable coin plus its entire network at your finger tips.  You don't have to offer any incentive at all to your miners because nobody can mine except for you anyway so they'll stick around and be your slave.

I got my Adwords account banned years ago simply because I changed my domain name, put up 302 redirects on the old site, and didn't change the ad beforehand.  It was all done automatically within an hour of the 302 redirects going into place.  Adwords would have none of that when I appealed since I was apparently being deceitful (same exact content as before just missing one letter in the domain).

I'm a scammer.  I buy your bitcoin which you sold against PayPal policy.  30 days later I claim to have not received something.  You tell PayPal I obviously did.  Here's proof in the blockchain.  Not only that you can sign to verify that you own that address.  PayPal looks pleased as you have proven half your case.  But they ask you.  Where is your proof that your buyer owns the address you sent the coins to?  So they ask me to provide proof I own that other address.  I have none because it isn't mine (not really).  You lose.

This is no different than Invisible Hand or any other plugin that has existed over the past decade except they usually make money as affiliates rather than selling you the item.

A few minutes after the 2016th block is mined governments or terrorists simultaneously put an end to all three mining operations.  Nobody exists in the world that can manufacture an ASIC anywhere near the level of technology that now exists.

No you don't.  It says so right there in the agreement you signed with Amazon that you would not ever do this. You cannot sell cheaper anywhere.  Doing this can and will result in termination of your selling privileges.  eBay won't hold you to the same rule unless you are a big seller like Buy.com (I spoke to one of their people and they confirmed this was an agreement they had, probably in exchange for 0 fees).

Using the bitcoin blockchain for this sort of thing might make some sense.  Years ago I wanted to write a software application.  Given the way the platform worked it was required to be in flash and would have been placed on an external website out of my control.  The problem is that I needed to store some information about the user this widget represents.  Most importantly I needed to know whether this person is a legitimate paying user of mine or someone who has stopped their service.  Piracy was not an issue and it is OK for people to abuse my service by tricking the widget into thinking it is authorized.  But it is not OK for me to continue my service for them without their permission.  People place this widget on their page but it is impossible for me to remove it from their HTML.  And telling them to edit thousands of pages is not an option if I still want to be in business for any length of time.  The service must be dirt cheap (I'm competing with random people charging $0.99 per month or nothing).  My widget might receive several million hits per day.  I don't want to create a service that requires 100% uptime just to validate subscriptions.  I could do this (and I've done it before) but it would be way too expensive given how critical it is that I terminate service when requested.  But I could store your info in the blockchain and just have several lookups through public services like Blockchain.info to verify your status.  Then I don't need any infrastructure at all.
That's the only practical usecase I can think of.

People didn't lose money during the crisis because the value of the dollar collapsed.  They lost money because liquidity and credit dried up and so did the demand for goods.  Suddenly you could no longer borrow money.  That means you are more likely to go bankrupt and you sure aren't going to buy anything that isn't absolutely necessary.  You think bitcoin would solve that problem?  If it had existed before the crisis the only thing Bitcoin would have done for people would have played a proxy to gold which boomed at the time.

I have a subscription model.  Though chargebacks are rare what happens is people often forget about the subscription over time or use a chargeback as a way of cancelling.  They don't want to bother cancelling on the site so they just submit a chargeback even though that is far more complicated.  And every month you don't cancel them they keep charging back.  It becomes evident very quickly to stop billing them when that happens seeing as you are on the hook $20+ each time they do it.

Not sure where the OP is but in the US if you send something to someone and they didn't specifically request it (e.g. buy it) then it is considered a free gift for legal purposes.  Otherwise people would send people stuff all the time and then threaten money or legal action.  Cue Cat tried that back in the 90s sending everyone an unrequested free barcode reader (think someone trying to make it big in QR codes but with barcodes).

I don't think that would happen.  You have 6k+ nodes.  When you crash and restart you just download the transactions again from someone else, correct?  So because there are so many nodes you just end up in this crazy thrashing mostly unusable situation rather than transactions vanishing.

Something I've noticed over the past few years is that successful entrepreneurs will jump into a space that has an extremely obvious road block that renders their business model impossible.  As you mention as they scale their devices become useless due to the difficulty.  No one in their right mind would do this because of that very obvious issue.  But that's what makes them successful.  Instead what we'll see is a complete takeover of the entire network.  Now they can pressure the protocol to change removing the cap and changing the way difficulty is calculated to fit the needs of their investors.

What likely happened is that there were lots of failed transactions over the years.  Then some organized team that was familiar with this issue in the protocol decided to take some free money.  They weren't detected for over 2 years because they only took small amounts but over 2 years it added up to a huge amount.  And now Mt Gox realizes that all the profit they thought they had doesn't really exist and they actually have less on hand than what people own plus the expense of infrastructure and employees.

The thing is that ETFs aren't supposed to match the value of what they are backed by.  They are supposed to match the price changes.  So if BTC goes up 10% you should expect GBTC to go up 10%.

Your THIS1 is something I've seen before in penny stocks.  There was a company called Ligatt run by the socalled best hacker in the world.  Anyway he had a history of fraud so he takes his security company and announces he's going to buy back all his stock at some price that was roughly double what it was trading for at the time.  Classic pump and dump.  The next day more and more shares kept getting released as people bought them up.  Then a month later he said that because of all the trolls on Yahoo Finance (he was suing about 20 commenters there) he was postponing his stock buy back plans.  He never did buy those shares.  I'm more shocked that this isn't that same guy.
If anyone is curious they can follow the exploits of that guy [here](  It may help in seeing the sort of stuff people like Josh Garza pull all the time.

Sadly this is correct.  I've stated it here many times but if you are serious about becoming big you absolutely have to please your customers.  And if that means forgoing all security practices that's what you must do.  The alternative is that people will get upset, they'll post negative reviews of your service, then they'll jump to your competitor who has terrible security but also lacks the friction you have.

The loss in money is his fault.  He didn't have to swap his bitcoin back and forth at high fees coming and going.
The ridiculous part though is how long it took to withdraw.  It isn't the ATM's fault but the protocol's.  Bitcoin is not usable as a currency so long as miner fees exist.  Tragedy of the commons dictates that people will refuse to pay the fee and have a very poor experience.  The solution is to force everyone to transmit transactions for free in the order they are received and then you'll see usability.

whichever one gets seen first AND included in the block will be the valid one
Except nothing guarantees this.  If I wish I can include the second one in the block and ignore the first.  And there's nothing you or anybody can do about that.  There isn't some big brother out there keeping track of the order I saw each transaction and making sure I follow your directions to the letter.  So long as it is in the block that's consensus.

Yes, please do this. And we should all coordinate a specific time to withdraw like 1/11 00:00 GMT.  The reason it has to be simultaneous is that people might upon withdrawing decide to redeposit.

"Unlimited Time Off" = "no time off".
Think about it.  If you are in a state that is "at will" which is probably almost you can quit or be let go at any time for no reason at all.

I have no doubt about the government documents.  My problem with CoinFire is that in at least one article he spoke with an Amazon "spokesperson" who revealed customer information.  Yet he wouldn't name the spokesperson.  A spokesperson by definition speaks on behalf of the company.  Clearly something was being lied about whether it was the customer information, the role of person at the company, or the conversation itself having ever taken place.  Of course this is something that can never be verified ever unlike a government investigation.
That is just one step removed from when Garza came onto Reddit impersonating an eBay employee claiming the seller was lying about Garza and then made all sorts of claims against the seller.
Then you have the whole ethics issue of getting people to violate their NDAs like he supposedly convinced a Stripe employee to recently do.  Again another thing that can never actually be verified.  But it is still scummy violating the trust of your customers like that.  And he encourages and publishes it.
Also, just to make you think a bit.  CoinFire is incredibly connected with government officials.  Mike has admitted to living in DC.  As revealed over the weekend and multiple times in the past CoinFire is running at a huge deficit.  They literally had no advertisers at one point and even when they do they charge $11 per week.  They don't get paid for articles (something I firmly believe).  It costs several thousand dollars to run the site per month up to possibly $10k.  So where is the money coming from to keep it afloat?  Where are the connections coming from?  Something that should make you think while you try to sleep tonight.

He is a serial scammer selling things that don't exist.  I believe the start was in cloud mining where you take in $100 and pay them back some amount of money every week but it is ever decreasing (because mining itself is a scam) until they are stuck with a contract that pays pennies per week.
The latest scam is what people hate him for though.  He created an alt coin which is just a fork of Bitcoin with a few parameters changed.  No different than almost all altcoins.  It was 97% premined which means the genesis block gives 97% of all coins to ever exist.  He then sold them on the open market claiming that he has partnerships with companies like Amazon and Walmart (which were complete lies) and that these partnerships guarantee the coin will never be worth less than $20 each.  I don't know what he sold them for but they peaked to $25 before plummeting to around $3 today all in just a few weeks.  Everybody said this would happen and it did.  I've seen exactly the same scam with penny stocks by the way.
Also he bought btc.com and is speaking at a Bitcoin conference to promote an altcoin.  That in itself probably warrants bodyguards even if he were an honest businessman.

4 transactions went awry?  That is less than 0.04%.  There is no way this is even close to reality.  The problem is Purse.io has no idea what happens between the Amazon buyer and the Amazon seller.  All they are looking at is what happened between the Purse.io buyer and Purse.io seller.  And what was reported to them (I'd like to know how many reports they just ignored).  Nobody has said that is where the fraud occurs.  Also I've heard of two cases on Reddit so unless I'm part of their fraud department that seems suspect.

You mention they don't have access to your old mail server but isn't your mail server located at acclaim.websitewelcome.com ?  When I query that server I see "SASL PLAIN LOGIN" which from my understanding means that after you've encrypted via SSL you send the password in plaintext rather than sending a hash.  If that is the case can you verify that you and none of your writers ever accidentally tried to connect to any mail servers posing as CoinFire's mail servers and thus accidentally exposed their credentials to a hacker listening specifically for pop, smtp, or imap traffic at mail.b-io.co?  You would have received a certificate warning but that could have been ignored with a simple click.  If this happened it would be trivial for the hacker to turn around and log into your real mail servers.

As much as I want to see a bitcoiner get made example of through an audit this is a very real possibility.  When you get audited you receive a letter in the mail.  It is basically a packet of information asking you to call your auditor and explaining what an audit is plus your rights regarding an audit (e.g. having a lawyer represent you).  And one thing I distinctly remember is I didn't have an audit or meeting in 3 days.  It was more like "call us within the next 2 weeks or else" and after that I scheduled the audit to happen around 6 weeks later.  I got my initial paperwork in July and didn't actually go to my audit until the first week of October.

Forks and millions of dollars in damages.  If you could actually completely isolate entire continents from communicating there would be multiple different forks emerging as soon as 10 minutes after communication was lost.  Your transactions shouldn't get lost since you sign them and they could in theory be replayed regardless of which fork ultimately becomes the true blockchain.  But you will have problems with who owns the mining rewards.  And if someone somehow had access to multiple networks they could easily double or triple spend.  Granted if someone had such a connection it is assumed that others could relay the bitcoin network as well.

One thing to keep in mind is that CoinFire isn't completely level headed with this controversy.  Just last week Mike tweeted he'd never use Gyft again due to their partnership with GAW.  This was picked and spread all over Reddit.  Gyft's reputation was harmed and he timed at such a time that Gyft could have very well just been asleep and not been able to respond.  Imagine waking up seeing a torrent of Redditors out for blood just because the most trustworthy newsource said you were a scumbag.  Turns out his insider at GAW was just lying to him.  Then Mike's Twitter account vanished.  Haven't checked to see if it is back.

For the majority of payments it will be cheaper than a wire transfer.  2.9% or 3.9% is cheaper than $15 or $25 since most transactions are for less than $600.  With PayPal only one party pays but with wire transfer usually both parties pay, so up that to $1200 to get an even better picture.

They are journalists with over 30k visitors per day to their website.  They owe it to their readers to provide a safe environment and that includes while those readers on their site.  Being journalists and doing good in the community doesn't provide a waiver regarding security.  To illustrate my point a few weeks ago they were hacked less than 1 hour after a negative article was published.  This means the hacker had to have compromised the site earlier.  Now imagine if instead of sending a message that hacker decided to just include a random link to malware in one of the stories without anyone noticing.

You are correct.  People here on already confuse "Bitcoin" with "Coinbase".  Anything that Coinbase does is somehow Bitcoin even when it isn't even related.  This is a huge threat to Bitcoin.

They might be tradeable somewhere.  But the utility is supposed to be with the advertisers which is the last milestone to be delivered in December 2014.  Basically people paid at minimum $0.02 per gem without even knowing what a gem will even do.  $0.02 is more expensive than a typical click on a mobile app for most countries.  I can only imagine how overpriced they are since you can't possibly compensate a person for clicking since that gives a very perverse incentive that advertisers don't want.  That means it is probably per impression which would be ridiculous.

No.  The problem is that Redditors are a bunch of demanding teenagers who think they know how to run a Fortune 500 company.

They have enough money to Martingale the whole thing.  A $5M loss means something like a 20% chance of bankruptcy at this point.  But if they bet on black 5 times they only have about a 3% chance of bankruptcy.  So it really makes sense.
Edit:  I did the actual math and they can only play 4 times.  So basically they would have about a 6 - 7% chance of losing it all.  So as long as $5M does put them more at risk of bankruptcy than 7% this really is their optimal strategy to get out of this situation.

Here's the problem with $300 coins.  It means the hacker would make even more money.  There needs to be a system of punishments in place.  Since we can't black list the coins and since it is impossible to truly track down these coins to the original thief we can instead devalue Bitcoin.  A lower value of Bitcoin will hurt the hacker disproportionately harder than most Bitcoiners.  For instance a 25% drop in the price would only cost me about $1k but the hacker would instantly lose $1.25M.

Amazon has security groups that should make it fairly secure.  It doesn't mean that your app is secure but it means you can be very confident that you don't have someone snooping from another VM.

No, if you lose your wallet you lose the cash that is in it.  If you lose your bitcoin wallet you might be able to restore it from a backup.  Or someone takes your money depending on what exactly you did and how you lost it.
But if you literally lose your bitcoins they are gone forever.


I just fill out a form online and my bank wires the money out for free same day.  This includes international transfers.  Granted they only send during normal business hours but I usually don't find myself needing to send money at midnight on a Sunday either.

Sort of.  But I don't think Circle has an actual building with tellers in it.  I was under the impression that Neo &amp; Bee was a real physical place.  So a virtual Neo &amp; Bee.  The difference is it is entering the market after Bitcoin lost 60% of its value rather than starting before it did.

Yes.  In fact the default limit is 5 unique IPs per host.  You can spin up a nano and add 5 IPs.  That's $38 per year plus a nominal fee for 4 IP addresses and now you've got 5 "nodes".

That's because you have to make it worth it for them to know.  Next time don't cheap out and spend just $70.  Try making regular purchases of $1500+ each time with Bitcoin and they'll start to take notice especially if they make mistakes to their benefit and put themselves at risk of being sued.

Uphold is basically a Bitcoin shorting service developed by Halsey Minor so he can safely short Bitcoin without the risk of the exchange defaulting, getting hacked, or exit scamming.

Not really.  Imagine if we made blocks unlimited size.  Then people would just spam blocks terabytes in size to prove we need smaller blocks.

No, actually it was a hack of Lucky7Coin.

See the problem there?  At no point was Bitcoin actually involved.  At no point was your cash even converted to Bitcoin.  They didn't buy any bitcoins on your behalf.  They never existed.  You simply paid Microsoft $9.95 and Microsoft received $9.95 (less a 1% fee).  Two and three years ago the only way to get into the payments industry was to claim you were involved in Bitcoin.

So sorry that CoinFire shedding a light on your illegal practices caused you to steal a bunch of people's money.  I'm sure Mike feels bad too.
Also, shame on you for trying to trick people into buying bitcoins from your site 4 months after it was hacked claiming the best arbitrage opportunity available.  I saw right through this and withdrew all my coins that same day.
@_date: 2016-01-10 11:57:11
You ignored every altcoin.  Why?
Case in point, NyanCoin went from 0.00000013 BTC to 0.00000015 BTC in 2015.  That means it actually outperformed BTC while also tripling its market cap in the same period.

Anybody can do whatever they want.  RBF doesn't violate consensus.  If you want just do the following each time you grab the source:

The funny part is that you can totally afford to charge this much with bitcoins because nobody actually spends bitcoin anyway.  It isn't like you are going to lose business over it.  If people actually used it you'd probably offer a discount instead.

Success for bitcoin would simply be everything (or nearly everything) using it as the underlying technology.  People stop calling it bitcoin and just call it money.

What is the deal with all these 2013 leaks being reposted to Reddit now?
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:28:48
Because there are people here who will benefit financially from a larger block size.  Namely these are American based miners.  So we've had to deal with several attacks and a well funded propaganda machine that has apparently worked brilliantly having duped over 90% of members into thinking big blocks are better.

They didn't just want to.  They actually did.  The crazy part though is they jailed someone a few years earlier for predicting earthquakes and scaring people with those predictions.

Except I will have spent that $1 long before these 40 years have passed.  And even if I didn't I didn't stick it in a non-interest bearing account so I've easily turned that $1 into $2 or $3 before (before inflation) within 40 years.  If you can't do the same you have no business having money in the first place.

No they don't.  Right now miners barely get anything as it is.  Now not only does want to make fees go down they want to give away their fees to other parties.

Danny didn't steal funds from customers.  He simply spent investor money on himself and didn't pay his employees.  That's barely illegal.  But the main thing is these crimes were committed in Cyprus.  He isn't in Cyprus.  The UK has no reason to arrest him.  Also, I'm not claiming he's actually in the UK since that would be doxxing just that if he were there he'd still be safe.  I understand that he's a protected citizen of on these matters.

That is correct.  If they were to allow trades right now everybody would be dumping their coins because Bitcoin is crashing.  By halting trades they can help prevent catastrophic losses to investors.  You see this all the time on Wall Street and it is a good thing.  Though you'll probably want to sell immediately once they start allowing trades again.

Donation model doesn't work.  And in the end you just end up writing fluff pieces that everybody in can agree with since that's what generates revenue (if any at all).  Most likely you just will be contributing free content to CoinJournal instead of getting paid like a real writer deserves.

Actually if you buy up all the Bitcoins then the community will just create a fork and abandon Bitcoin calling their fork Bitcoin leaving you holding a worthless bag of tokens.  That's basically exactly what happened with Etherium when one entity had too many Etheriums that it made people uncomfortable.

You really shouldn't be worried about 9% inflation.  The thing about Bitcoin is you know exactly what the inflation is today and tomorrow.  Knowing that means it will all be priced into the market unlike real currencies whose inflation is never known until after the fact.

Which mods though?
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:51:58
Why?  This actually reduces spam in the blockchain.  OP_RETURN is 40 bytes.  This allows for 60 bytes within those 40 bytes.  So that means there will be a reduction of up to 1/3 spam.  For instance if I had a sentence that required 120 bytes of storage I'd have to spam 3 transactions.  Now I only have to spam 2 transactions.

You get to it when you get to it.  So long as the transaction doesn't evaporate from the mempool and the mempool doesn't grow forever then it will be mined eventually meaning the cost is still there.  Plus as long as the transaction exists it can't be respent.  So in reality it makes sense to put off mining it as long as possible.

And then blur it.  Actually the best way to obscure data is to remove the data entirely, replace it with fake data, then blur that.

It is in their best interest to not pay any mining fee at all since they get their coin at that price.  But it is in your best  to trade coins at their value rather than the value 2+ days later.

Problem with Bitcoin is that it is very difficult to secure.  If you've spent much time around here you've already seen countless threads of people mysteriously losing bitcoin.  If you have certain programs installed on your computer they'll get stolen.  If you use any company other than Coinbase they'll probably get stolen eventually.  If your computer runs Windows and you store bitcoin on your computer you will lose your bitcoins.  The same is true about rooted Android phones or jailbroken iPhones.  If you don't make a backup you'll lose your only copy.  If you use a brainwallet someone will guess your key.  If you store your bitcoins on your computer and your computer has ever been connected to the internet you'll lose your coins.  If you use Blockchain.info as a wallet you'll lose your bitcoins.  And when any of the above happens to you people here will explain that it was your fault because you missed one of the required 30+ steps to properly secure your coins.  Or you could just buy a bar of gold and then buy a gun to secure it.

PayPal agrees to act as an intermediary between you and the person sending the money.  If you turn around and scam the first person but run with the money they would have to give the money back to them out of their pocket.  What PayPal discovered is that approximately 2% of transactions are fraudulent but that if you wait 21 days the number of situations that are still fraudulent then are less than 1 in 2000.  That is an acceptable risk when you make a little more than that from each sale.

Those are people who are trying to convince everyone we need a 20MB block size.

Right and I'm sure Coinbase posting that they had 300% more signups didn't have anything to do with this post.  I find it interesting that people play the one up game like that with their figures yet never post any specifics or proofs.  Just an incrementally higher number than someone else.  I'm sure someone will post 375 or 400 soon.
I've seen this sort of thing before in my own line of business.  At the time I was the largest in the industry with around 500k of something.  All my competitors in a period of 2 months started posting numbers to random sites like in press releases or job postings.  First one said they had 6M (I actually know it was closer to 100k), then another posted 7M as a stat a week later.  By the end everyone seemed to have exactly 1M more than the other guy.  None of the numbers were even remotely true.

Bitcoin costs you 1% plus a miner's fee.  So if you are sending/receiving more than $4500 your example is actually cheaper than bitcoin.  The only exception to this rule is if you already have bitcoin which you likely don't and even if you did you'd have to buy more to replace what you just sent so you are no better off.  I can send via Western Union through my bank to foreign countries half way around the world for free and the money arrives within an hour (even I find that hard to believe but it is true).

jet is just a company that wants VC money and to be one of Amazon's acquisitions.  It doesn't have a sustainable business model and a lot of the things you can do on the site will do nothing but cause them major headaches.  They literally let you decline the right to return in return for a discount.  You know what kind of people did stuff like that?  Buyers on eBay in the early 2000s.  And very upset ones at that.  Everybody in ecommerce though realized that this is a very bad thing to do.

There is variance but you are mathematically guaranteed to surpass them given enough time.  Eventually you just publish the last 1000 or so blocks you found destroying the old blockchain in the process.  Just do it when you are so far ahead it makes absolutely no sense to even try to undo the attack.
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:26:43
Are you sure you would have solved the block on the correct chain?  Doesn't each block depend on the previous?  So in essence if you were mining on the wrong chain you probably wouldn't have solved anything on the correct one anyway just due to the extreme odds of doing so.  So in reality you didn't lose anything.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:36:21
Why do you have a problem with the tests?  Every time one of these tests is performed two things happen.
1)  Miners get incrementally richer.  Why do you hate the miners?
2)  The price goes up.  Every single time this happens the price goes up, possibly because it is harder to exit, or something.  I'm not sure why but it happens every time.
So in reality this test is good for bitcoin.  It really is.

Dead man's switch.  Split your key into 3 parts.  Then find 6 dead man switches.  Give each part to a pair of switches.  Have all 6 set to email to your spouse or whoever you trust to not die on you.  Have them assemble the keys in whatever order that works (or just tell them which piece is which).  Problem solved.  It is important to have a minimum of 6 because this lowers your chances of failure.  You should add more people to the emails assuming you trust more than one person.

Well think about this.  Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.  It is deflationary because coins are continually lost.  That means Bitcoin will inevitably die.  Why would you want a currency that will eventually die?  Adding back lost coins doesn't make it inflationary so there's no reason not to.

They don't have to be lost.  Nobody is stopping anyone from redistributing the coins.  Just put in a hard fork that says any address that hasn't moved after 300,000 blocks are no longer valid and then proportionally distribute them to the miners as a bonus block reward.  You can easily postpone the halving for months or years with this strategy.

There's really no need to input tracking manually into a website.  Microsoft is a smart company with lots of innovation.  They should be able to come up with a system that tracks their users via their cell phones.  If the cell phone signal is in their office then it checks some other sensor that detects that the person is in the office.  Once it knows they are in the office it can use face tracking to determine if they are really working or not.  And then record everything in case of dispute.
For taxes just pay the taxes upfront.  Then the state has nothing to complain about.  We have a good idea what an employee is going to be paid in advance.  And if they don't get paid that much then you claim a refund.

WhatsApp is worth $20B yet Vonage is barely worth $1B.  Like an actual phone company with paying customers and basically invented VOIP could be bought by simply giving up 5% of their stock.  Yet the funny thing is they don't do that because they know it would actually harm their perceived value.

Yeah, if he tries to pay via PayPal what ends up happening is they charge the amount plus amount he is negative to make up for it.

I made the mistake of trying to explain this to someone one time and got run off his website.  Always take Yelp reviews of medical professionals with a grain of salt.  My dentist has great reviews but I'm under the impression she isn't telling me everything that is wrong with my teeth.  On the otherhand all the dentists with terrible reviews almost universally have reviews that say something like "I had a toothache, dentist told me I need a $1200 root canal, turned out to only be an infection and now I'm fine.  Scam, 1 star".  Anyone who knows anything about teeth knows that once it gets to that point the tooth is as good as dead and it doesn't heal on its own.  These same people will be wondering why their tooth cracked in half 1 - 2 years down the road.

PayPal has frozen my account exactly once since 2002.  I had just made $10k+ sales of iPhones within a period of a few weeks.  This was about 3x my normal volume at the time.  I got frozen, eBay required I accept PayPal only, and I paid eBay $99.95 to promote my listing which was blocked from making any sales.  PayPal unfroze my account 5 days later meaning I lost over $100 in non-refundable eBay fees not including any lost sales which were marginal since supplies were extremely limited and I would have sold out either way.  That's the entire damage PayPal has done to me in over 13 years.

What if there was some sort of computational cost that gets progressively more difficult to compute the larger the block you mine?  We basically have this already for solving the block itself.  What if we got rid of the limit completely but you had to do the same process again but for each transaction starting from a difficulty of 1 with the difficultly growing exponentially for each added transaction?  Then your spamming miners would bear an actual cost but the calculation for a small number of transactions would still be fast enough that it is worth including them in the block.  This would allow bitcoin to scale naturally as hardware becomes faster.

I don't understand why this wasn't required before.

yeah I had to do something like that with Fedora Core 1 when I wanted to install it on an external USB drive (something that nobody ever did back in 2004).

They weren't an aggregate.  Mike (the purported editor) is an alias supposedly for a rich VC who has very obvious connections deep within the government.  Mike tended to write stories that nobody else covered or disputed stories that the rest of the sites all covered by doing actual research.  That research supposedly involved flying himself or one of his 2 or 3 freelance writers out to the company's headquarters and interviewing the people involved in person and collecting the relevant documents.  Then he started doing investigative journalism and the cult behind Paycoin hacked the site several times doxxing sources (people who are probably now permanently unemployed), stole his domain name, and lots of other things.  Then he faded into obscurity with rumors that it has to do with the SEC lawsuit against Josh Garza (scam artist and creator of Paycoin).  My guess is he just got tired of sinking tens of thousands of dollars into a website that had no ROI and literally earned at most a few hundred dollars per month.  He is a VC afterall.

The community is still relatively small and people/companies can still be easily identified.  In the future people will have no idea what mining pool cashed out.  Good luck getting someone to be honest when they are completely anonymous and there is no chance of retaliation.

It has to do with the purpose of the site.  It was built specifically for drug sales.  That's why it is illegal.

If you read your twitter responses someone says it was from SendGrid.  As I'm sure you are aware SendGrid is a third party company that performs email sending and signing as a service.  You can have dedicated IPs for an extra fee (practically required to send anybody email these days) so they probably just added an A record to a SendGrid machine.  It is highly unlikely SendGrid itself was hacked.  What was probably hacked was CoinBase's SendGrid account or their SendGrid API key got loose.

Believe it or not writing down what you think the password is is not proof that the password is correct.  I get easily 2 complaints per day that the password system on my own website doesn't work.  It works.  People either use plugins that replace their password in real time or type the wrong thing.  I eventually set out to prove this by logging a number between 1 and 1000 that represents what was typed and funny thing is people try multiple combinations of passwords when they claim they know the password.  If you knew it you would have typed the same thing each time.

Bitcoin's major weakness is that it is decentralized.  This is exactly why all the solutions proposed to make Bitcoin even better (make it faster, scale, sidechains, etc) all seem to be ways of centralizing it in some way.  It follows then that Theymos running both places is actually good for Bitcoin.

That's too late.

Nearly every DNS hack is the registrar's fault.  eBay got hacked in 2014 because someone claimed they needed some A records updated but couldn't access their email or something like that.  And their registrar happily redirected all paypal.co.uk traffic to a defaced website for them.

They should actually sell slightly below market.  This would cause an influx of people to come to the ATM and then you can sell them stuff while they are there.  This is exactly how gas stations work.  They aren't selling you fuel to make money.  They want you to buy cigarettes.

Clarifying your point a bit it is important that the price increase substantially today so that when they are telling their family about bitcoin they can point and say, "Look it is up 12% today alone" instead of the gloom reality that it has dropped over 60% in two years.  That makes the case to get new bitcoiners involved much stronger.

Even if it isn't a scam Bitcoin wallets are virtually impossible to write and have them work properly so you are likely going to lose your money anyway.

You'd have to get them to sign up for Bitwage.  Fill out a bunch of information stating that they aren't using them for money laundering along with giving details about their business (which I'm guessing they aren't running one) and then add the OP as an employee of theirs.  He then gives Bitwage a bitcoin address.  And it only works with some banks otherwise you have to wire the funds.  I don't see this working in an ecommerce situation at all.
@_date: 2015-11-23 21:57:33
You are actually correct.  The problem is that Bitcoin does not make an existing business more profitable and the only new businesses that can successfully exploit it are those in industries where privacy is absolutely required.  That is virtually only ever a necessity when doing something illegal.  Naturally businesses committing illegal acts are not going to be high profile since the owners don't want to be arrested.  The one stunning exception to this seems to be Purse.IO.
All the businesses you list will begin doing the same though.

it is very easy to say this when you own a significant portion and can easily weather any storm.  But there are people here who buy on margin like on bitfinex.  They can't and would likely lose their entire investment if this happened even if they were really willing to hold and wait for the price to rebound.  Whenever that sort of thing happens the price usually doesn't recover.

They are testing to make sure all that software they installed on a lot of people's nodes and mining equipment actually works and won't doom everyone in less than 2 months when it activates.  Considering it took 4 months to get people to even install it good luck actually fixing the issues in that time frame.  Given that virtually nobody has adopted it though makes this all a moot point.

No.  Not possible.  Or at least not probable.  Desktops use 3.5" harddrives.  Laptops have always used a variation of 2.5" harddrives and use a completely different interface.  That being said in 2006 I was selling adapters that let you put laptop harddrives inside desktops.  But the odds of someone having one of these is astronomically low.  Also since 2009 the interface has changed greatly within both.  But ask yourself this.  Why would someone overpay for a HDD to stick it in their desktop rather than just use a much cheaper, much faster, and much larger desktop drive?  That being said if this happened in 2015 it would be believable since SSDs are almost all universally 2.5" or smaller both in desktops and laptops.

Then they'll charge you outrageous storage fees and shipping fees to return your goods back to you from their warehouse but also give you the option to pay them to throw it all away.  Then they'll take you to collections after you can't pay back your initial loan.  And finally they'll buy directly from your supplier using all your previous sales as data for themselves.

So I search around and it says I probably was updated enough to get the option.  So I tried Windows update.  For 1+ hours it sat there downloading at 0%.  In the meantime I figured I'd update my NVIDIA driver too.  It also sat at 0% downloaded the whole time.  Looked up why it might hang like this and got one person saying just wait several hours because it is really downloading and another that said to enter three commands on the command line.  Tried that.  Every one of them failed with errors.  But then suddenly I could download my updates.  Linux at least makes sense.

If you sent money to a PayPal account that doesn't exist you can immediately cancel the payment at any time.  If you sent it to the wrong address but it was valid you could have always disputed it and received a refund in full within seconds in the best case or 30 days in the absolute worst.  It is extremely unlikely that your seller would have changed their paypal payment address and even if they did they could have linked it to their main account.

I'm Roger Ver, long-time Bitcoin advocate and investor. Today, I'm at the Gemini world headquarters in New York City. I had a nice chat with Gemini CEO, Tyler Winklevoss, about their current situation. He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers. I'm sure that all the current liquidity problems at Gemini are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at Gemini. The traditional banking partners that Gemini needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy. The dozens of people that make up the Gemini team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with Gemini easier for all their customers around the world. For now, I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.

It is actually in their best interest to string you along.  For instance if this guy gives them 1000 bits odds are he will actually get a payout as promised.  It is when he deposits 1 - 2 BTC on the second round that they steal his money.

By this logic he should invest in Paycoin.  It is probably the riskiest crypto you can possibly invest in today.  You are almost guaranteed to lose everything if you hold for much time.

The more exchanges the easier it is to buy and sell bitcoin.  This means the price will actually go down and stabilize.
1)  Just before Gox imploded Bitcoin skyrocketed and remained even higher priced on Gox.
2)  When a stress test happens Bitcoin goes up in value.  Difficult to transact when it takes a few hours to confirm some of your transactions.
Adding another exchange is the complete opposite of these.

If you hold you take your BTC out of circulation. Many think this means the price goes up but that isn't necessarily true.  Instead you are reducing liquidity.  Historically when liquidity is taken out of the stock market the price actually drops.

Is WeChat reliable?  I'd be worried about repeated messages, lost messages, and out of order messages.  Sure those can happen on the website too but you immediately know since you get feedback right there.  Also is it encrypted end to end?  What is to stop someone from intercepting the message either between you and WeChat or within WeChat?  With the website you have SSL so you have certain guarantees provided you weren't dumb and installed some hackers root certificate.

What this means is that whoever tampered with it wants you to see the tampering.  It could be the poster wanting karma, a free device, or to stir up drama.  Or it could be Mycelium wanting to prove that their devices have a need and that their sticker protection system is necessary.  Whatever it is it isn't someone like the NSA who is tampering with your devices.  In fact this video pretty much proves every single device that has been shipped is suspect and should be tossed out.  Instead what we need is an alternative device which goes out of its way to not even have its sticker because it is already safe.  I saw them posted here a few days ago but forgot the name.

That isn't an Apples to Apples comparison.  Why not make it fair?
First you have to create an account at Coinbase since you have no bitcoins.  Verify your identity.  Then link your bank account.  That takes about 3 days.  Your bitcoin order will most likely be cancelled so you must try again later.  After a few tries you finally get your bitcoins.  Then you buy your game and send the bitcoins but Coinbase waits an hour to send and your merchant uses Bitpay so the invoice got rejected and the coins refunded to who knows where.  A few days later you get your coins back and try again.  You finally get your product but the coins cost you 1% to buy and Bitpay has some conversion rate you had to eat as well.  Then you finally decide to close your Coinbase account and that takes a week (not so sure about that last point).

It is less secure than cash in that when I open my physical wallet I know the cash will still be there but when I open my bitcoin wallet there is a fair chance I did something wrong or a third party did something wrong and now all the money in it is missing.

Unless you sent it to the wrong address it isn't gone forever.  One day in the not too distant future the last node will reboot and forget about your transaction and then you can send it again.  Or maybe RBF will become a real thing (people seem to hate the guy who came up with it so maybe it won't) and then you can just resend with a higher fee.

But in the Garza case they supposedly went to their "partners" and "unnamed spokespeople" provided details that are against company policy to reveal.  They were never named yet the word spokesperson was used.  A spokesperson is by definition a person named to speak on behalf of the company.  That is literally their job.  Everybody with half a brain knows Garza is a scammer.  So it is very safe to put words in the mouths of people that don't exist backing up this assertion.  Naturally none of those people were ever named.

Spend about $20k and you can get a decent one.  Then you spend your millions.

No, bitcoin's price is inversely proportional to how easy it is to transact and trade with it.  This is why coins were so expensive on Mt.

They secretly wish these were banks that had Bitcoins stolen.  The reason is they'd be insured.  So the customers wouldn't lose anything but at the same time losing half the world's Bitcoins would greatly increase the value for everyone who wasn't deposited in the banks.

Except for the fact that for at least 8 years there has been software that integrates with PayPal that you can run on your wifi router to do exactly what you are talking about.  I know this because 8 years ago I was going to do the very thing but the router that Amazon sent me was the crippled version with not enough memory and I got sidetracked before being able to try it.
Today however wifi is plentiful and so is 4G.  There really is no business need for this anymore.  Add on the fact that Comcast or one of its competitors already does this with their service for free for their subscribers and all their new routers shipped have this enabled by default and you are fighting a losing battle.

Except last week some guy got his account hacked.  They refused to even respond because he didn't have 2FA enabled.  And that is part of their TOS.  They simply won't investigate any fraud on your account if 2FA isn't enabled.  What does that mean though?  It means if you don't have 2FA they can and will steal your funds from you.

At which point you stop making $1 bills.  Now you can fall another 80% which would roughly 50 years.  Once that happens you stop printing the $5.  This gives you another 20 years.  Then you stop with the $10.  This gives you another 20 years before you have to stop with the $20.  Then finally you have another 50 before you get rid of the $100 and the entire economy collapses since there are no dollar bills left to print (nobody uses the mythical $1000 bill even though it does exist).  That means you have roughly 140 years to come up with a solution once it begins.  I'm pretty sure paper bills will have disappeared within the next 50 years so the problem won't exist anyway.

It isn't at all comparable.  The Cryptsy thing is just wrong.  Coinbase didn't owe anybody anything for this incident.  Phishing emails are not Coinbase's fault and completely out of their control.  As long as it wasn't called "Coinbase" that isn't their fault if you are stupid enough to authorize a third party app to withdraw your coins.  This is a feature that is needed for their service and unfortunately there will be people who abuse it like this.  So what Coinbase is doing is well beyond what is necessary.

So then have a paid app and a free app.


Because Apple did it.  And Apple can get away with anything.  They are a company that named one of their products "Airdrop" years after someone had published an app called "Airdrop" in the app store.  In all the articles about this it said Apple was considering their legal options on how to handle that developer (e.g. how they will force him to rename and then trademark it themselves).  And Apple got away with it.  And nobody questioned it.  Since Apple did something this is then license for Google to do the same.

That isn't how taxation works.  It isn't a criminal court.  I was audited years ago and what happens is they sit you in a room with the auditor and ask you about every single thing that shows up in your bank records that is more than a few hundred dollars.  Fortunately I have an almost photographic memory when it comes to such things so I could identify everything.  Ended up only having to pay around $600 and even got a tax rebate on the next year's taxes because I "forgot" to take a deduction before.  The audit stopped shortly after I started finding such deductions.

No, I'm not mostly wrong.  I'm 100% correct.  If you are selling on Amazon you don't submit sales tax to your state.  Why is that?  That's right, because you didn't sell anything.

No, Amazon is actually selling it.  Amazon is not like eBay where third party sellers create listings and make sales.  Amazon makes the sale and a third party merchant fulfills it.

I seriously doubt eBay will accept Bitcoin at least not in anything of its current form.  eBay is all about ensuring the transaction goes through and if it doesn't (or if the buyer lies) that the transaction is reversible.  You don't gain customers or please them by letting them throw money into a blackhole even if that is what they say they want.  eBay is also notorious for being used in money laundering schemes.  Bitcoin acceptance would only further that.

You are confused.  You are talking about rolling reserves.  In a rolling reserve they simply don't turn over the money that is in your PayPal account for 90 - 180 days due to the possibility that claims may be made.  This is a rolling amount based on your present volume.  Sometimes it gets ridiculous rates like 80% but usually 10 - 20%.  This has killed several businesses but they do not go into your bank account and siphon off all your funds "just in case".  These are funds that never left your PayPal account in the first place.
There are plenty of terrible things to say about the company but don't make up stuff to push your bitcoin agenda.  There are those that will see right through it.

It actually will crash again and fairly soon.  I saw an ad the other day for an ASIC that can do 5 GH/s.  I don't follow bitcoin that closely so I had missed this product.  It looked amazing after the review I read so I decided I'd buy one.  Nope, you had to have preordered them back when they were announced.  And they have ones that do 100 times that and it is actually affordable if you are semi-rich.  Then I saw an article from January where one person was doing 2 TH/s.  I was going to preorder one but by the time I'd get it it would just be a paperweight.  I'm not saying it won't ever recover but I don't think right now is a good time to be in Bitcoin.

Um, and what is eBay supposed to do with that?  You see one address sending an amount of bitcoin to another address.  That proves nothing.  Do you really think eBay is going to let you specify your address and sellers specify theirs and use the blockchain as proof of payment?  And how are you supposed to get your money back when you dispute the transaction?  They certainly aren't going to give you bitcoin out of their own wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:24:27
This is exactly why I didn't get into ASICs.  If you want one buy one on eBay for an inflated price just make sure they have it on hand.  They usually cost 3 - 5x what the preorder price is though and they all have very short lifetimes before becoming obsolete.  It may just be better to buy the equivalent amount in bitcoin.

I disagree.  Not everything sold at a supermarket makes the supermarket money.  Have you paid close attention to eBay?  They have entire swathes of their website dedicated to sellers who pay them nothing.  It is about providing something of value to your customers and offering gift cards can bring them into the store.  Another great example of this is gas at a gas station.  9 times out of 10 that gas station is making practically nothing if they even make a profit at all when you go there to fill up.  They just want you to come inside and buy beer and entice you to go there by offering you fuel at near cost.

Amazon isn't your friend.  They should be feared rather than welcomed.  They aren't going to accept Bitcoin anyway due to its irreversible and volatile nature.  If some buyer comes along and buys something for 1 BTC on Amazon and then decides they want to return it in 30 days (per Amazon policy) does Amazon refund 1 BTC, 0.50 BTC (the price doubled in 30 days), or 2 BTC (the price halved in 30 days)?  Regardless of what they do the customer is going to be upset and feel cheated.  And they are still going to charge their sellers the same transaction fees and cut them a check.

This is so false.  You've obviously never run a business.  It is extremely common for this sort of thing to happen and the buyer almost always wins any dispute like this.  Think of it this way if your mom sent you a check for $10k and you cashed it knowing it was no good should the bank go after you for the money or your mom?  And should you have that $10k available to spend because the bank supposedly has insurance?  If the world worked that way people could create cash out of thin air.

tax?  You still owe the tax.  Any retailer who thinks they can skirt the tax issue by using bitcoin deserves to be audited and shut down.

Dogecoin will do what BTC has failed to do and that is make BTC the only real crypto coin.  Nobody can take the other altcoins seriously if an internet meme is more valuable than them.  It provides a valuable service to the BTC community so I don't understand what all the hate is about.

I do but I strongly believed it would go down after Black Friday.  Invested in half a coin thinking I'd just buy it on its way down assuming it went down and if it didn't then I'd at least have something if it continued at its current pace.  Then as it started to go down I find myself blocked by Coinbase since they don't let first time buyers have multiple outgoing purchases even after they've withdrawn the money.  By the time my first purchase cleared it was already back to $950 :(

One thing I've learned over the years is that people hate people who have money.  Now apply the network effect to that hatred.  You may have Bitcoin but I don't so when it is realized that Bitcoin is actually viable and is seen as a legit currency people without Bitcoins will rise up and use a different currency instead so they can be rich instead which will collapse Bitcoin's value.

We should stabilize bitcoin.  Then they'd have to accept it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:39:16
Here is the problem.  Imagine you are a business who sat on the sidelines for years.  You knew about bitcoin but it was just fake internet money to you.  Then you decide to take the plunge and accept bitcoin after it finally looks like it is going mainstream.  And you make quite a few sales from bitcoin on the busiest shopping day of the year.  Then a few weeks later it loses half its value meaning those extra sales you made are now actually a loss and a severe one.

If they are just rumors why did everyone sell then?  People buy on rumor and sell on the news.  By this logic it was news.

OK, and what is to say that they aren't doing this?  All they have to do is cash out, take that money, invest, and pay you a small amount of bitcoin interest.

What is the matter with using Bank of America?  Escrow.com uses BOA and they are the only official Escrow service allowed by eBay.  They are also partnered with Flippa.  Using BOA doesn't mean you are a criminal or stupid.

You get whatever coin you purchased at the price they were going for at the time of purchase.  You don't lose anything from a delay other than being able to spend them or sell them.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:49:06
I had the same thing happen to me and just got my coins today.  I didn't get them at the current market rate.  Maybe I should have been mean to them instead of telling them I didn't care.

As a scam artist accepting bitcoin, I'm going to undercut all the legit businesses so you buy from me instead.  I can afford to do so due to the lack of chargebacks.  And since it all balances out for you in the end you aren't really a victim.  Win-win.

Considering all the hype we see on this subreddit we could all end up in that situation with or without Wall Street.  I'm worried that all these small businesses are going to jump onboard, it immediately crashes, and they all cash out either out of fear or being forced and an entire generation of the middle class gets wiped out, again.
