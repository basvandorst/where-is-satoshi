In what way?  What other coins are as utilized as bitcoin right now?

Seems like the wisest post so far in this thread.

Funny how leftists often chide conservative opinions as "conspiracy theorists" and yet they fall prey to their own lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:33:51
Good idea. Make sure you don't let them negligently share the private keys

If you sell them on localbitcoins I don't see how they would know.
Who's to say you didn't give your BTC away or lose them somehow?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:53:51
I think the issues are more likely a symptom of the dip

Coinbase may report to IRS.  Be warned if you decide not to report the gains.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:46:56
What makes you think that?  I could see that by this time next year, but not in four weeks.

No it can't, you conspiracy theorist. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:40:18
Send btc to another wallet, once it's empty, sweep private keys into coinami app and you can obtain your btc gold without any risk.
Afterwards, dump your old wallet and use the new one exclusively since you've exposed the private keys to glean the gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:37:25

Anytime you create a link to Google authenticator (with that particular service) it will give you a backup code. If you don't have it, I'd recommend resetting it now and saving the new backup code in case your device is lost or stolen or broken.

I've had btc on there for years and nothing happened to it. Either way, I would wait til the transaction fees come down. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:53:58
Honestly coinbase is pretty safe, provided you use two factor Auth. I had some btc in coinbase from a few years ago and it was still where I left it when I got back into it this summer.

I hope you're right. Theyre trying to take over that brand and they may be successful. From my research, this is bitcoin's biggest trial yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:26:29
Coinbase is the only one that I've seen that will do it for you. You should be able to split it on your own if you use electrum or a similar private wallet but it will likely be a much more involved process. Someone with experience with bitcoin cash could answer better. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:31:09
Is that even possible? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:12:21
Coinbase is going to split the coin for you, which is probably the easiest and safest way to do so. If you don't trust them, you could withdraw your btc to a private wallet. I use electrum for that. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:13:11
Jesus enough arm chair activism already, what are they paying you people? Or are you just a willing sheep?

Usually takes exactly a week for me. I have a weekly buy set up and it initiates on Friday and usually clears next Friday

Wasn't really that hard. It was like 8000 two weeks ago
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:00:42
This is just cringe worthy 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:15:45
I think so. The question is whether or not to cash out prior to the fork. Might drop substantially, or, if 2x fails, might take off like a rocket.
At this point I'm thinking I'll sell half of my btc prior to the fork. Minimize risk even though might not be the most profitable course of action. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:59:58
Sounds like you're in luck. Grats! Just input that code when you recover wallet. Try electrum
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:21:49
Heh.  I feel the same way about me at 4k.
The worst part for me is I bought a stupid quarter ounce of mushrooms for $80 a couple of years ago.  That $80 was 0.3BTC :(
Imagine all of the junkies that literally shot up millions worth of BTC these last few years.  Poor souls.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:02:12
It's perfectly safe to use, just a fee to use. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:18:42
Interesting choice to get in now. I'm sure you've read about the upcoming fork.
Bitcoin will likely either crash some or fly higher than ever after the fork. Prepare yourself accordingly
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:35:27
I just cashed out for USD.  Not going to buy either until the dust settles from this crap.
They're just setting bitcoin (whichever chain wins) back by years.  Selfish pricks
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:52:43
what a dick lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:16:14
About thirty five bucks. I would just buy btc though 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:56:29
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:48:42
Ding ding. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:56
Then do a hundred and maybe ten bucks a week after that.  If you leave your BTC on an exchange you can easily cash out whenever you want (and even set up automatic sell orders) so no need to worry about "losing everything".
Go ahead and make the jump, you won't regret it.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:37
See my comment below.  Watched it happen both times.  Definitely a coordinated "attack" or whatever you want to call it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:02
I think only USD is FDIC insured.  If someone hacks your account and steals your BTC you are probably SOL.
That said, grab a 0.1BTC and see where it goes.  Can't hurt!
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:16:25
Probably more so for you, but it is quite awesome seeing my meager holdings more than double now.  Wish I had your bitcoin backstory ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:19
I've noticed twice today on Gdax someone flooding market w sell orders of 0.01 btc set like 3 cents apart.  Happened earlier first time it hit 9990 then again at 10900.  Seems like coordinated attack from Ver or something.
They'll lower the price artificially with like a hundred 0.01 orders then once it drops sufficiently, put a order wall of 100 + btc and try to maintain the wall.  So blatant.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:18:44
I'm not worried about price drop; I'm worried about this bullshit Bcash attack.  Wish they would fuck off.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:08:25
I just watched it again w this drop. It's the same quantities spread over many orders. Has to be coordinated probably on all exchanges too. Maybe botnet or something 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:32:09
That's the plan.  Just sucks may never get the chance to have a full coin now lol.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:53:46
Dumb bitch lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:06:37
You can claim that all you want but I literally watched it occur. It had to be coordinated; it was too sudden. And the wall at the end they tried to maintain for a time. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:58:44
Maybe it was the Nicehash payback program from the hack in December
