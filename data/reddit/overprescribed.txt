cool! I forget what its like being in 'A City,' as opposed to this dot on the map border town I've ended up in. I think I may need to move back to a place where people use smartphones and there's things like 'meetups.'
then again I could probably start the SE AZ bitcoin meetup. I did see a bunch of ingress points nearby- there could be hope yet!

seems there's a Mexican market with it near me, too. I'm interested

donate it to thepiratebay, right at the bottom of the homepage there. or if you're like me, pay for the services you definitely get at a steal if youre just being advertised to.

seriously? you work for a bitcoin- related company, then?

I assumed as much, though I was hoping you'd say no. interesting link, too.
can I ask what your normal route of exchange(s) is/are to make purchases from retailers that don't take bitcoin? your situation is curious

jebus, the things people care about not having to do a lick of independent research about.
'i just want to walk into a building with 'bank' on it/surf a site with 'bank' in the name without knowing anything about them and give them my money! help me government, independent research takes up my valuable time believing everything I see!'
