bitcoin is a store of value not ment for quick transactions. You lot keep trying to make it something it's not. This is so complicated, not to mention people now have to figure out how much 0.003 is worth in comparsion to their actual money. To much effort. Keep it a store of value.

You're so right man. Like right now with my money in my bank account I have like zero control whatsoever. Like who knows when one day I'll login and it will all be gone. And shit man don't even get me started on privacy. Who knows who is looking at all that money.

Also with the internet, it serves a benefit to everybody and they knew it right off the hop. With bitcoin people don't really understand why it's important.

A better argument for bitcoin would be using your CC at Target then finding out their credit card information has been compromised (which is was) now you have no idea if your information is being sold, you can now easily become a target for identity theft. With Bitcoin that can't happen.  
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:56:19
Just like fiat, no one can ever take it. However, can you spend cash online, no. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:12:24
Good point. Bitcoin is in exactly that stage that you just described. So once it get's more adaption get ready for the "dotcom" bubble. History tends to repeat itself
