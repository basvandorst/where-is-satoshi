I saw [this post]( from a couple days ago where the OP used a service called LibertyX. No idea how well it works, but it seems to be what you're looking for. Good luck!

The bit about losing security was my main concern with the idea, too. That's why I was mentioning parity, I was wondering if there was a way that you could utilize that or something similar to hashes, where each sub-blockchain kept track of it's own transactions in addition to having some mechanism of assuring other sub-blockchains were kept in-check.
I guess I'm unsure of how exactly that would be implemented (I'm obviously a bit unfamiliar with most of the details of how Bitcoin works), but mainly I was wondering what other solutions have been explored or discussed beyond "raise the limit" and "don't raise the limit". The hierarchy idea is definitely interesting as well, do you happen to know if that's been discussed as an alternative solution?

I may be a bit out of the loop here (I don't pay much attention to these forking debates), but has a solution like this been explored? Could the network have multiple blockchains that keep in-sync with each other? Maybe something similar to how RAID drives keep parity with each other? It seems like an interesting idea, at least.

Yeah, it's still pretty big news, I think. I know 4chan was having a lot of problems with accepting payments for users in some countries, so if this helps alleviate that then it could really show the potential of a global currency.
It'll be neat to see if it works out for them. It got me to sign up, at least!

Hey, thanks for the replies everyone. I think I spent so much time reading about how bitcoin is generated that I kind of lost sight of the point - that it's a decentralized currency. Now that I'm thinking about it in the proper terms, I'll probably switch to bitcoin for taking donations, and I may even convert some USD to bc and spend it in some shops I find! 
Anyways, thanks again everyone for your help! The whole Bitcoin thing is really awesome, I hope it catches on!

Hmm. That's not quite what I wanted to hear. I think this idea is pretty interesting, but if the average person can't get in on it, I don't really see the point.
That said, I probably will end up buying some at some point.

Here's [a list]( though it's two months out-dated. Also, since Bitcoin is anonymous by design, you can't really tell who owns any of these accounts.

That's actually a pretty good idea. Any idea if something like this will ever find its way into the official client?
