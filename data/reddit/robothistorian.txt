So...two questions about this: (1) do events like these have a discernable impact on the whole market (i mean across exchanges globally) and (2) do events like this trigger price increase or decreases? Thanks

Take a look at this: 
Does it make sense?
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:34:32
That's true.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:59:36
So do you guys think it can tumble down to anywhere between 2.5 to 5k in the short term (by which I mean in the next couple of months)?

And PMC is hardly "one of India's biggest banks".

In a word, information or, if you like, education (edit: or, sharing).

Well then we have to agree to disagree. But from the convos I have had with some members of the political class who are debating the regulatory norms, it appears that this is their primary concern. Of course, you may know better.

But while Bitcoin is on the ropes, it certainly hasn’t gone away and global regulators still need to find an effective way to rein in the cowboys. And while this hasn’t been a systemic risk this time, the eventual spread of digital currencies will mean that isn’t always the case.
This is the key! Notice how the narrative spins out..."global regulators still need to find an effective way to reign in the cowboys..."
And why is this an imperative? Because the threat is not about financial losses. Rather, the real threat is that it undermines the authority of the State. The tragedy is that the cat is out of the bag. Like it or not, in the same way as the circulation of knowledge/ information cannot be regulated, neither can cryptos.
This chap who is sharing his "opinion" via this article, like his "idols" (Buffett et al), remains wedded to the notion of a centralized authoritarian structure. Unfortunately for him, as Licklider wrote years back, the "intergalactic computer network", though still in its infancy is a reality and cannot be wished away.

Can't one invest in a currency? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:53:41
Agreed! And, in the process, as I mentioned above, to the very foundations of the Nation-State. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:25:42
Nice! 
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:16:34
Hey...can you share your list of faucets? Thanks
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:26:41
Yeah well, I am not sure the Indian government has that kind of a nuanced understanding. They are really scared that they will lose control. It just represents the retrograde kind of thinking that is prevalent in the bureaucracy and the political class. So much for "Digital India". Lol! 
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:43:51
Wow! That was a devastatingly critical review. And, by the looks of it justified too!
Edit: which leads me to ask: if one had to read or recommend just one book that encapsulates BTC and it's theoretical grounds and practical applications (both direct and indirectly) what would that be?
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:17:11
Ok. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:47:03
You gotta get an upvote for just that, if nothing else!!����

I read a few chapters of his book. Interesting and I can see/ feel the passion. He also seems quite good at breaking things down into smaller easily digestible pieces. That said, however, there is more than a hint of idealism in his assertions. I find that this detracts from the force of his argument. This may work as a "popularizer's" tool, but it's not something that would stand the scrutiny of a rigorous investigation. Nevertheless, it's interesting. Very interesting.
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:52:14
Thanks. Will check them out.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:37:57
Yeah...absolute morons!! 
Edit: And, they don't learn from history!!
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:29:46


It's off topic, but I was wondering if there is a difference between "hystory" and "history". You used both words in the same sentence.
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:39:52
Then why are you wasting your time posting about btc/ crypto? You are out so you are out!
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:57:31
If Bitcoin does not prevail, it's not because of any inherent weakness in the model or the tech. Rather, it will be because the State will not allow it to. Why? Because the State will not tolerate - at least in it's present form - any mode of the circulation of value that it cannot control or dominate and Bitcoin and the related tech is something that the State cannot control thus the antagonism of the State vis a vis Bitcoin (and cryptos in general). But this does not mean that as a speculative asset the value of Bitcoin will not rise. Already one can see a cyclical pattern to how Bitcoin moves, which suggests that it will or is very likely to transcend it's previous ATH at some point in the near future.

That was an excellent read. Thanks for posting.
