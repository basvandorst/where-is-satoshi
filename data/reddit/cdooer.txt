Exactly.

I agree with all of that, I really do, and I support cores efforts. I just don’t understand why core won’t do something seemingly trivial, in order to temporarily alleviate some of the pain people are feeling...especially the new users. It would help speed adoption, and would almost certainly kill off the ‘other’ chain.

It’s evidence of a phenomenon, not a bubble. I specifically remember watching the chalk boards back in the 1600’s, and there wasn’t a single stick drawing where tulips were the central theme of the episode.

Seems like you’re here to simply argue about something you know nothing about. 
The two answers to your questions are yes, the coins are gone, and no, the fact that they were featured on a TV show means nothing regarding a bubble. 
Now go back to your professional investing, banker controlled people screwing, and 3% returns.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:49:16
I don’t think anybody said if you put $100 in, you’d be rich next year. You might be exaggerating bit. 
But, if you put $100 in right now, and it goes to a million in 10 years, you might be pretty happy you took that yyuge risk.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:59:21
I'm confused...this post isn't about transaction times, transaction fees, or generally anything negative about BTC at all...are you sure you posted it in the right place? Ha!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:48
I just transferred 5 BTC to my exchange, and it took about 10 mins. I used a high fee (~$90), but it seemed like it was almost instant. Not sure why.
By comparison, I transferred the same amount of BCH, to the same exchange, and it took about 40 mins. Albeit the fee was much less. I thought it was supposed to be the other way around?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:53:03
This has gotta be a joke...right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:28:42
Given the absolute mess this thing has become, and the fact that it’s basically become unusable...it really makes no sense not to increase the block size, even if just a little. 
Even if it doesn’t reduce fees, and shorten confirmation times, at least Core could say “see, we told ya so”, and we could all move along with our lives. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:53:01
Ahh, ok that makes sense.

I’d say sell, but that won’t work either. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:23:01
You're talking about trading one crypto for another...which has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's trustless because if I want to send BTC to someone, either for a service, a product or whatever other reason, there is no trust involved.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:01:03
The idea remains the same...the miners need to pay bills, which in an all Bitcoin ecosystem, would be paid in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:30:19
Just curious...does this mean some large entity will be buying bitcoin, and holding it for their clients? I’m confused how the money will actually flow in. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:51:46

Did you check the flux capacitor? Normally that’ll tell you a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:40:08
You're talking about two different things here. Exchanging one crypto for another is not trustless...even if it's face to face. There's nothing to say that the person won't punch you in the face and run away as soon as his side of the deal is done.
Transacting in BTC is indeed trustless, and not something you would do face to face anyway. It sorta defeats the purpose. Nobody is saying exchanges are trustless.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:38:42
HA!!! You had me right up until the second wife...nobody that smart would be stupid enough to do that again.

@_date: 2014-10-10 15:57:19
Why does it take 4 or 5 days to get the coins after you make the buy? Is Coinbase doing something different than a company like VoS? There I get my coins as soon as the buy goes through.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:40:03
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:09:54
You're limited as to how much you can send though. I think I'm limited to $1000 per day. Plus, the simple fact that the banks are involved make it the opposite of BTC.

@_date: 2014-03-19 23:24:01
The way it was explained to me was that if they hacked the Gox 'safe', they essentially had open access to all the coins stored in the 'safe'. If the Blockchain.info 'safe' gets hacked, they only get access to all of the client' 'safe''. Blockchain.info basically only stores your safe (encrypted private key), not your coins.
That probably makes no sense, but I'm pretty drunk, so...

From what I've read, BU isn't proposing a 2mb limit, there won't be a limit. This is from a post I read earlier
"You have to understand that BU is not about 1MB going to 2MB blocks. They want a HF to unlimited block size, determined by the miners dynamically. This is the "emergent-consensus" concept that is the center of BU. It's permission for the miners to increase the blocksize without another HF or SF. This changes much more than just the blocksize -- the very dynamics of power and future course would shift.
You're not alone -- most of the community is misinformed in the same way. The BU campaign is not at all about a switch to 2MB fixed blocks."

I recently dumped half my BCH stash for a bunch of Vertcoins using Shapeshift...which was working out great up until the recent BCH pump. I was surprised how easy it was though, no ID or anything. 
That’s an option for you.

Nothin so far this year, down about $800. Cashed out $14k last year. Funny though, born n raised in Canada, and I can't pick a hockey game to save my life.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:08:51
It was $20mil
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:54:15
Ya...it was almost the exact same price when I went to bed, as it was when I woke up. Time to panic.

Yep, I believe the fork has already happened. It's actually a 1:10 ratio.

It increases centralisation. Not everyone has the means to ~~mine~~ process an 8Mb block.

Bitcoin will stabilize eventually, it just needs to find its ceiling. We’re still at the bottom of this hill though...long way to go. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:20:41
I’d say just don’t bother even bringing it up. Maybe just put an AA video on the tv, and let it loop. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:02:58
I’ve always been curious about the comparison with Visa. When I pay with my Visa, I’m not using my own money. I’ve got $25k fake dollars I can use when I pay with my Visa. If I were to pay with Bitcoin, I would need to have those funds available. 
Seems like we’re comparing two completely different things. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:15:20
Ha ha. This last dip was nothin. For me, $1000 —&gt; $200 was the scariest back in ‘14. Everything since has been pretty easy. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:04:23
Crap, that sucks. I thought it was maybe a replay thing...I've got my coins on a Ledger, split them yesterday and sold them on Bittrex. Thought maybe my BTC was at risk...briefly had a panic attack.

I’m confused. What’s that all about?

Not sure what to tell you. A coworker of mine said it was too expensive to buy in at $1900, then at $2500, then again at $3000. He’s kicking his ass now.

There are plenty of ways to minimize the amount you’ll get taxed...I’ve got no plans of cashing out any time soon, but it’s good to have a plan. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:06:03
I don’t think it’s any specific setting in the code. I think it happens because after X amount of halvings, there are simply no more block rewards to hand out...thus ending the creation of new coins. 
I’m not a coder either, but that’s how I understand it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:06:32
If Core would just go ahead and plan/implement a larger block size, BCH would likely be crushed. Now would be the perfect time to add it to their roadmap, and actually follow through with it.

I could probably do something not too crazy...maybe .46 BTC on Stamp. For some reason it's a little unsettling though, given your willingness to bet at the current price. lol
