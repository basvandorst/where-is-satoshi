The spirit of it is what is available for consumers. 
You're advocating that moore's law is alive because in 6 years we went from a 2TB mass produced hdd for 250$, to a 65GB proof of concept drive that costs over $100k and isn't available to anyone?
Don't be dense, that isn't the spirit of the law, and it sure as hell doesn't support peoples view who rely on moores law to solve their scaling issues.

And that isn't available to buy, that was proof of concept and estimated to cost close to 100 000 USD.

By a large part of the global population. Its current use as a currency is being hindered by the massive increase in price and adoption. The technology for fast, cheap transactions needs to catch up. Which is pretty understandable with how quickly it blew up.
A global deregulated currency is needed. It may or may not be bitcoin depending on if they can improve transaction speed/cost to match how many people are adopting it. Some people are realizing this and putting their money into BTC believing it will be the one. Some people are putting their money into it without knowing what it is, thinking like it is a stock, like you said. These people could still help bring it further adoption, but if BTC fails and another currency takes its place, these people may be left broke if they haven't kept up with the changing market.
How I see it, is there is a need for a global, decentralized, deregulated, open currency. It could be BTC, it could be BCH, LTC, a combination of a few, or a new one all together. And then have the question of what is a currency like that worth? I don't know. Nobody really does. But I am willing to put a amount it that fits with my risk tolerance to find out.

I'd wait till you are up 300%. If you pull out at 100%. Then any future gains you will be "losing" half of. If you pull out at 300% up, then you are only "losing" a quarter. Might make it a bit easier to deal with if it blows up. But it all depends on your risk tolerance really.

I think the price has no where to go but up. The more people who get into it, the higher the price has to go. There is a hard cap on coin limit.
Though, there needs to be more education around it, and what the end goal is. It shouldn't just be pushed as solely an investment to eventually turn back in regular fiat. But should have the end goal of global adoption and being able to trade it for goods and services worldwide.
It is going through some growing pains in terms of transaction time and fees, but with the massive growth, some pains are to be expected.

Yeah, but whales influencing things is one issue, they bought in heavy, so their movement makes waves. A completely different issue is exchanges being involved in manipulation.

People must demand open and transparent exchanges, and not use services that are participants in market manipulation.

And they think that is decentralized and progressive. Completely against why bitcoin was created in the first place. And he thinks it is a good thing!
All that would do is sell out our currency to corporations, which would be even worse than central banks!
We need make people more aware of why bitcoin was created. It is to bring the power of currency back to the average person. That was Satoshi's vision, and that is what Bitcoin is trying to achieve.
BCH totally forgets why bitcoin was created, and they just want to create the next Visa.

Exactly, you make a point I try to get across to people often.
But then they just say "Moores Law".
Except moore's law is dead. Even MIT has written articles to  state this.
2011 I had a 2TB HDD. If moores law was still well, we would have 64TB today in 2017. Except we don't. The largest we have is 14TB.
MIT states that because moore's law is dead. We are left with increasing efficiency through more efficient programming, rather than relying on hardware increases.
Second layer solutions does this, it looks to use our current tech more efficiently.
Larger blocks rely on hardware, which is hitting manufacturing walls, limiting growth. This will result in centralization as the hardware required further rises above what is available to the consumer.
The real solution to keep the idea of bitcoin alive is second layer solutions. Maybe if moore's law was still alive, then increasing blocksize would be okay. But moores law is dead and we have to realize we are hitting limits as to what the materials available to use can produce, and then try to use them more efficiently, like creating second layer solutions.

Hur explained his reasoning, “Mr. Ulbricht’s conviction and life sentence in the case handled by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York have been affirmed BY the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court has declined to hear the case. We have dismissed the federal charges based on the same conduct pending against Mr. Ulbricht in Maryland, which allows us to direct our resources to other cases where justice has not yet been served.”"

It sort of does.
From a legal standpoint, the drug charges he was convicted of carry life sentences maximums.
From a moral standpoint, this wasn't just a victimless crime of drug sales, SR also facilitated the sale of guns along with hits for hire, though it's contested how legitimate those were. The guns were very real.
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:08:38

And silkroad also sold guns.
So you're stretching hard when it comes to morality. This wasn't just victimless drug sales. Illegal guns were sold that very possibly could have been used to commit murder.

You could easily test gold bars without cutting into it or x-raying it at all.
What you would do, is submerge the bar in water and measure how much water it displaced. Then you would know it's volume. With that you could easily work out its density.  At around 19 g/cc, there really isn't any easily obtainable elements heavy enough to replicate the density of gold. Tungsten would be the issue, but you can test for that easily with a magnet and scale.

No. Agents involved are now in jail for extorting Ross and stealing btc.
But this was a very large multi jurisdiction investigation.  The evidence is sound.
Also, Ross didn't deny DPR did what DPR did. Ross denies he is DPR.
So either you believe ross is DPR, and did all the things that DPR did, because Ross doesn't dispute what DPR did. Or you believe Ross isn't DPR, like he says he isn't, and that he isn't crypto jesus he is just another small worker in someone else's grand plan.

Sheeple being manipulated by Ross into defending that piece of shit.
EDIT: Your statement about how he was standing up for what he believes in is also 100% bullshit.
Ross denies being DPR. If Ross was standing up for what he believes in, he would own his actions. Instead his defense was that he wasn't DPR.  
So yes, your uninformed defense of a piece of shit like him is just "hype". 
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:32:16

They waited **years** until all his legal appeals were exhausted, then they dropped the case. 
If they had no intention of going forward with the charges, they would have been dropped years ago. But they sat and waited to see if he would get an appeal, and were ready to prosecute if there was any chance he would ever get out of prison.
But all these crypto sheeple are so easily manipulated, and Ross is using them to somehow go free. He didn't give a shit about bitcoin before, it was just money. He only cares now because it's his only hope and the crypto world is full of sheeple who like to hype.
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:19:16
No, it isn't. And Ross's defense wasn't to question the evidence. Ross's defense was he wasn't DPR.
If this in some way exonerated him, why didn't he bring it up?
Instead, he claimed not to be DPR.
So what do YOU think?
Do you think Ross is DPR, the one who brought btc to realworld use.
Or do you believe Ross's defense, that he isn't DPR. Because he didn't dispute what DPR did. Ross disputed he was DPR.
So which is it?
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:32:06
I have no sympathy for him. He was pure ego and greed from the beginning to now.
He should have stopped when he was first being extorted, instead he tried to have people killed.
They caught him **logged into his laptop** in a library and traced him back to an old email address he overlooked when setting up SR.
And he actually chooses to fight it, rather than take a deal. They have him dead to rights, and he still can't keep his ego down enough to take a deal.
And now he is turning all these sheeple into his little defenders by twisting the facts and narrative.
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:20:42
What do you not get?
His **entire defense is bullshit**. They caught him logged into his laptop in a library. He outed himself by not covering up an email address used to register a username asking for technical help setting up SR.
His ego was his downfall. He could have taken his fortunes and walked away, instead he took the bait, tried to have people murdered, then tried to fight the case when they had him dead to rights, when he should have taken a plea deal.
Now he has convinced a bunch of crypto noobs he is some sort of crypto jesus that brought about real world usage of crypto, as if it wouldn't have happened anyways.
The guy is a straight up piece of shit manipulator, and you are all fools defending him, coming up with bullshit fantasy defenses so dumb his own defense never even brought them up, yet you all think are genius.
And now you are saying let's "assume" he is DPR.
Either you think he is DPR, and tried to have people killed.
Or you think he isn't DPR, which means he really means nothing to crypto and youre riding his dick for nothing.
Which is it?

There is mountain of evidence. 
Why don't you read up on the case before asking questions, Ross kept journals. He journaled his own accounts of seeking murder for hire.
Also, if you bothered to learn before asking, the charges were dropped because Ross exhausted all of his appeals and Marlyand would be wasting money. 
Ross is in jail for life for drug crimes.
If he wasn't, Maryland would have went ahead with their charges, and he would be in jail for life for murder for hire charges.
Maryland's motion to withdraw the charges, specifically stating his no chance of appeal as the reason for withdrawing the charges.
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:27:03
You are contending the murder for hire evidence is somehow fabricated. 
But Ross's defense didn't. 
So your point is bullshit. As the question isn't whether or not DPR tried to get murder for hire. They clearly did, and even Ross does not refute this.
So either you believe Ross is DPR, SR founder and tried to have people murdered.
Or you believe he is just another cog in the SR machine like he claims and someone else was the real mastermind.
Which is it?

The point I am illustrating is Ross himself did not even make the bullshit defense claims that people are now making on his behalf.
He had no defense, he journaled everything. He wrote his own fate and instead of making a deal, he fought it claiming not to be DPR.
Yet people keep defending him on things he didn't even defend himself. Because they are so strong set to think he is some crypto jesus, that they will believe he is someone who he says he isn't, but won't believe all the evidence to prove what he actually did.

**Do these quotes sound like someone who really cared about the tech? Ross was in it for profit from day 1, driven by greed, just like I said.

Then there is the storage costs of fiat in vaults. And you need a network of vehicles to securely truck it all around the nation.

The court documents are the best source.
Most notably the murder for hire related charges out the state of Maryland. Even the wiki links directly to them.
He was being scammed, but he ordered and paid for, what he thought was a murder against a Canadian father of 4 who he thought could damage his operation.
People who have the choice of taking their millions and disappearing, or trying to buy a murder instead, and choose to try to have someone murdered, should be in jail. But that is my opinion.  He could have fucked off with his earnings, and at the peak, he would have been incredibly wealthy. Instead it was about the power, and when he thought someone was trying to come for his business, he paid for what he thought was that person's murder. Fuck Ross, and I've been following this from back when I was on SR myself.
Do your research, Ross is using the crypto community, and in turn some shitty people in the crypto community are trying to turn Ross into a martyr because they just want gains.
Greed supporting greed.
@_date: 2019-09-20 02:10:56


So I take it you are not very familiar with the case?
The charges related to murder for hire were from the state of maryland. (See attached court indictment)
Which they waited for the **other** jurisdictions to finish giving him a life sentence, as well as wait for Ross to exhaust all appeals, before they finally withdrew their charges, **explicitly stating it makes no sense to continue with charges that would lead to a life sentence, to a person already sentenced to life without parole.**
You need to stop and think that multiple jurisdictions had ongoing investigations into SR. You think the largest online drug marketplace just get noticed by one agency/jurisdiction? Many were involved, and the corrupt ones were arrested. If the whole thing was corrupt, how the fuck did the corrupt FBI agents get arrested?
Corrupt FBI agents thinking crpyto's anonymity would allow them to scam doesn't mean Ross didn't do all the terrible shit he did.

Not convicted doesn't mean did not do it.
And again, why do I care about what you are anyone else claims, when Ross himself didn't deny it?

Or, You could be an informed person, and realize there was **multiple seperate** investigations going on at the same time.
If there entire investigation was corrupt, how the fuck do you think the corrupt agents were arrested?

This is  about facts. 
Not bullshit you can imagine and make claims about when Ross himself didn't even make those claims.
But keep using your imagination to delude yourself from reality.
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:47:13
You mean the non corrupt agents who arrested Ross **AND** the corrupt agents?
Like FFS, think about your stupid argument, if the entire system that indicted Ross was corrupt, how the fuck did the corrupt FBI agents get arrested?

Well, most of the drug charges he was convicted of carry life sentence maximums already. 
And the Maryland prosecutors only dropped the murder for hire charges because Ross just got denied an appeal, so according to the Maryland prosecutor, it doesn't make sense to expend resources trying a case against someone serving a double life sentence without appeal.
If the original drug charges were sentenced more leniently, then the Maryland prosecutor wouldn't have dragged their feet for 5 years and he would have likely been convicted of those as well, and would be in the same spot he is now.
There really isn't a scenario which would have had him walk. He could have took his millions and disappeared. He instead wanted to play kingpin and got scammed then busted.

FFS read your own link.
It even links to the damn court doc.
EDIT: 
READ. LEARN. STOP BEING A GULLIBLE SHEEP.

Several of his drug charges carried life maximums. 
According to the Maryland prosecutor, they dropped the murder for hire charges because it'd be a waste of resources to try someone already facing double life without appeal.
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:52:39
Because he was already sentenced to life. Not due to lack of evidence.
And you realize that Ross didn't deny that DPR procured murder correct?
Ross denied he was DPR, he did not deny that DPR did what DPR did.

A street dealer and an online dealer have essentially the same supply chain up until the final dealer, and maybe the one above them.
So as a conspiracy theory, it doesn't really make much sense.

They charged fees for old transactions. They can't decide now to charge for it, and then retroactively apply the fees to all past transactions.
You know that restaurant you like to go to? Yeah, they now decide they charge a 15$ service fee, they just just used your credit card number to charge you for every time you ate with them in the last year.
 
It is their business, they can run it the way they want right?
No. Because that is stupid and illegal, you can't retroactively change the agreed on fees.
But even the currency conversion fees are stupid. Because what if you went to a local currency exchange shop, and paid by debit. You pay the exchange fees to the exchange shop, not your bank. Would you expect this 15$ currency exchange fee on top of the fee you paid to the exchange shop? No. Because BoA didn't exchange any funds, they just processed a regular debit transaction.
It is the same for coinbase, they are accepting a regular debit transaction with BoA. They aren't exchanging currency for you. Zero reason BoA could claim a currency exchange transaction fee, because they did not exchange any currency.

They were dropped because Ross ran out of appeals and has no chance of parole, **The charges were not due to lack of evidence.** Maryland waited for Ross to exhaust his appeals, before finally withdrawing their case, stating it makes no sense to sentence him to another life sentence.
I'd suggest becoming more familiar with the facts of the case.
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:45:37
They did press charges.
The state of maryland was the jurisdiction with the murder for hire charges.
Why are you even commenting here when you don't even know the basics?
Court docs regarding the murder for hire charges are even on freeross.org FFS.

How is the sentence out of proportion?
Tons of hard drug dealers out there get life sentences. He ran a multi million dollar global drug market.
How do you expect him *not* to get life?
And even if he didn't get life on the drug charges, he would have got life for the murder for hire charges.
There is no timeline in which Ross gets off free.
If he wanted to have a chance of ever being free, he should have cut a deal.

It is traceable. It is probably the most traceable currency, as every transaction is recorded forever.
What it relies on is anonymity.

Do you realize that not even ROSS denied that DPR did what DPR did?
Like FFS, you are claiming things didn't happen that **not even Ross himself denies.**
Ross denied he was DPR. He did not deny DPR did what DPR did.
So good thing you know about all this evidence to the contrary, **because not even Ross him fucking self made the claims you are.**
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:34:20
Well, what do you believe? 
That Ross is DPR, the founder of SR and did everything they claimed DPR did, because Ross didn't deny DPR did what was alleged.
Or you believe Ross isn't DPR, (like he  claims), in which case why deify him when he was nobody to crypto?
So either you believe he is DPR, and did all the things we know DPR did, in which case he is a piece of shit and should rot in jail.
Or you believe he isn't DPR, and should be freed, but it also means he was not highly influential to btc, and the real DPR is out there.
EDIT: Those are essentially the two options given the real facts of the situation. Ross is just trying to hop on the crypto bandwagon as a last ditch effort to get out of jail since all of his appeals are exhausted.
@_date: 2019-09-20 02:19:50
What do you not understand? 
Ross did not deny DPR did what DPR did.
Ross denied he was DPR.
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:33:54
How about this, show me where Ross denied DPR did this?
Because not even Ross denied DPR did these things, Ross denied being DPR.
But thanks for trying to rewrite the narrative. Making up bullshit defense claims that not even Ross himself claimed.
And if you are asking "not a different DPR". Then you clearly don't understand torchat or the own personal records he kept.
So if you aren't familiar with the tech, or the defense, or even the actual facts of the case, why are you commenting here?
Because it sure isn't because you are familiar with this case.

Charges dropped due to him recieving a life sentence without parole from **another** state. 
The charges were **not dropped due to lack of evidence.**

He was never convicted for it because Maryland dropped the case.
And not due to lack of evidence, or tainted evidence, but because he was facing a double life sentence.
If he hadn't received life, Maryland would have proceeded with prosecuting him.
Agents tried/did to extort him, though he did not know that. And they do not produce the evidence seized. 
In Ross's mind, according to his own records, he had people murdered. He paid, he was told they were dead, he was okay with it. He thought he was going to be outed, and instead of taking his millions and walking, he decided to try to have people killed.
I'm not okay with a person like that being released from prison. Hope he enjoys the holidays.
