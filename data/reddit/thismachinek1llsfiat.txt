One of the reasons I own bitcoins is because [where I live]( legislation has been enacted, which [goes into effect in 2016]( which allows bank bail-ins.  (I believe that Germany and Austria already have such legislation since 2015.)  Wences Casares believes the probability of bitcoin going to zero is 20%.  I believe the probability of such bail-ins is much greater than 20%.  That's why I keep most of my money in bitcoins, and a smaller amount in [silver]( to hedge against a situation where bitcoin goes to zero.

Very much in agreement, except that:
1. The fundamental value of a bitcoin, based on the growth of the number of  transactions and addresses (Metcalfe value), is currently approximately $3000 per bitcoin, not mid five digits as you wrote.
2. The top in 2017 will probably be much higher than you think, partly due to the coming global economic collapse, and partly because the rise in price will cause another speculative bubble which will take the price one order of magnitude above the growth trend line of the fundamental value.  I estimate $250000 per bitcoin in December 2016 or Q1 2017 (Seasonal activity in Bitcoin peaks in the winter.). 
3. The correction after the 2016/2017 all-time high, will not be that steep, and will take longer.  The last major correction (in 2014) was less steep and took more time than the previous one (in 2011).  (Partly because a higher market cap usually implies less volatility.) Thus the next correction will slowly go from $250000 to no less than $50000 per bitcoin around 2019.
Note:  All dollar amounts refer to (the purchasing power of) current dollars.  Because the purchasing power of the dollar approaches zero over the course of the next few years, it's best to measure bitcoins in ounces of gold instead of dollars.

On sites like GATA and zerohedge, I've read countless stories about the alleged manipulation of the gold price by means of naked short selling, but I personally don't know enough about that to know for sure if it's true or a conspiracy.  However, according to the legendary  Jim Sinclair,  [the dollar price of gold will increase by 50]( when the price of gold is "emancipated from the paper markets".

1. Bitcoins are not backed by any underlying property.

At multi million dollar bitcoins, the dollar presumably would no longer exist so the dollar/bitcoin exchange rate would be infinity.  Hence, it would be better if everyone expressed the bitcoins exchange rate in gold ounces.  The dollar is not a stable measure of value.

Yes, but by "everyone" I meant "everyone", not just everyone that posts here.  That is to say, it would be great if e.g. all the exchanges and chart websites displayed the bitcoin price chart in ounces of gold as well as dollars.  This is not a trifling matter, because I believe the dollar price of gold will increase 50-fold very soon, which is 1.7 orders of magnitude on a log chart.   Drawing trend/support/resistance lines for bitcoin then becomes meaningless if dollars are used as a unit.

Some people will have wallets with multiple addresses, in which case the  addresses/person ratio is greater than 1.  Other people will keep their bitcoins on exchanges which hold a small number of addresses with large balances for many customers, in which case the addresses/person ratio is less than 1.  On the whole I think it evens out.  Addresses less than 0.001 BTC contain spam a.k.a. dust.  Therefore, I have the hypothesis that the number of bitcoin addresses with a balance greater than 0.001 BTC is a good estimate of the total number of bitcoin owners in the world.  Currently that number is 2,811,526, which agrees well with other such estimates done with other methods.

"Fides" refers to faith in the money, not trust in a counterparty.  Your definition gives paper certificates as merely an example of and as the historical origin of fiduciary money, not as the sole definition. 
The [Dutch Wikipedia page]( gives a better definition; use Google Translate.
[Strictly speaking, any money has a fiduciary component.](  In fact, I would argue that this is the defining quality that gives something moneyness (the attribute of being money).
[Calling an entry in a ledger a commodity]( is really stretching the definition of commodity beyond belief.
