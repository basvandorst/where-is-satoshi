absolutely brother, they have acquired the major regions by their gaming &amp; now Tencent is like walking door for success and as they have been receiving rewards, prize money, promotions, free trips, sponsorships, visibility. In this position, it's difficult to understand &amp; people don't want to understand about the inside of any organization till the time they are profited.
