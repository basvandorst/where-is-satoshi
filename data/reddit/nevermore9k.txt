But where are you spreading the word, to your mom? I am not hating on you, I just said that it's sad what this sub has turned out to be .  Instead if of a healthy balance between tech and non tech, it's all non tech, uploading pics or random things.

Bitcoin sub have become a place where special snowflakes meet, and when you say something realistic, you get bombarded with down votes. Instead of tech development related threads, these stupid posts gets up voted. What have Bitcoin become..

These are nothing but PR stunts. Right now you cannot buy anything with Bitcoin because it's such a volatile asset . Right now for me Bitcoin looks like a massive pump and dump scheme, relying on the greater fool theory.

No, the government isn't lying. Natural Logarithm is a log with base as e . It's denoted as Ln() instead of Log(). But you are in crypto, you should have know what Natural Logarithm is.

It's not about killing itself. Do you see the inflation? In weaker currencies?  The amount if debt the government is piling every year, the USD is going to inflate too. Just imagine your retirement fund is not even worth 50% it's value  due to inflation.
