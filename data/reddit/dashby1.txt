I would reduce the amount that you have so you are willing to hold either to zero or to the tens of thousands I think it will achieve. 
If you are that worried at these levels, you are investing too much IMO.

I'm still putting this 'experiment' at 50/50% of

Settle down my friend.  For tens of thousands of years, the world has been 'falling apart' and is always at war someplace in the world.  Yet, here we are.  
If we were truly 3rd world, maybe your concerns would be more valid, but the nation will not fall to a nationwide police state within your lifetime... bank on that rather than "riots, wars, famine" that will rule your world.
@_date: 2016-06-13 14:57:51
We are not going to change our mindset that 1BTC=1BTC for many years yet.  We must still equate it to what we generally measure value here in US in USD.  This is not a bad thing... just shows that our precious is rising in value against another particular measure of value.
And based on this, we will get more interest, more press, and more buying.

You will stop loving these 'round' numbers when you truly absorb that this is a global currency and is valued against 100+ fiat currencies.  "900" has no real meaning when you think of the world wide impact and usage.

Its always controlled by supply and demand, like price discovery on anything else...
I think it will go to 5 figures.  Why would I sell at 1k?
$1,000 means a higher percentage of hodlers think it has more value and will hold plus a hoard of new buyers.
When this reaches the institutional level/interest, the turbo will kick in.  the rise between 2k-10k will be furious in my opinion...

not really - an explosion would cause damage at this point and time to the ecosystem.  
This HAS to grow relatively slow and steady to ensure stability - quality builds/forks/dev, etc.
"Popping it into Amazon or Walmarts" today would cause a failure and severely damage perception of its use case.
