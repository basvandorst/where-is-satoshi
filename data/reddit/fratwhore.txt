You took it out of context. Money *you earned without paying taxes on*. If you paid taxes on it, there wouldn't be problem. The IRS would know about the money because you would've declared it.

No that doesn't work. You need to pay taxes on the value of the item you buy, not on the actual purchase price, so you can't say you only paid $100 for a plot of land worth $1MM, that won't fly (or do you think people wouldn't have been doing so for everything?).

It's not about bitcoin, it's about paying taxes. If you're evading taxes, but still using the services provided for by those taxes, then you're morally wrong. It's as simple as that. You can say that you don't agree with where the money goes, but that's a different argument.

I think the problem wouldn't manifest itself, since 90% of the people can't buy property without getting a mortgage. The mortgage needs to come from a bank, the bank needs to have assurance that it can foreclose on the property, so it needs the registry to prove to the government it owns the property when the mortgage defaults.

I see it like insurance. You pay it in case you ever need it. I hope I'll never need law enforcement, but if I do, I'm glad they are there. They're my insurance against thiefs and kidnappings and murders. The problem here is that, much like vaccination, everybody profits from having it even if not directly, then indirectly. Because if criminals are off the streets they are not robbing your home. So you might not notice that LE has actually benefited you, but it probably has. So how can you "opt-out" out of something that has benefited everybody, even if you don't want it directly?
You might say, for now, well I'll just use my own gun to protect against thiefs, I don't need LE. But you're still benefiting from a much less dangerous environment than e.g. 500 years ago. The risk for you is much less than if no one was paying for LE. The other way around, if LE didn't exist except for private individuals, then criminals who would otherwise be afraid of LE would take much bigger chances, and everybody loses.
(Sure, they might arrest people for things you do not agree with, but no system is perfect. This is the best we can do for now.)

All the arguments against taxation seem to come from people who are earning enough money, and would not have a problem hiring private education or law enforcement or providing for basic needs. How would you suggest we protect the poor people of our society if not by taking a little from everyone and distributing it to those in need? If you say donation, how much have you donated from your BTC gains?

You made the wrong causal connection. Please try again.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:18:55
Same as if you paid in cash:
If you don't declare the bitcoin as income, this would look like you got land for free. E.g. in 2011 your total assets were $10000, in 2012 suddenly they are $10000 + a piece of land.
The government will wonder how you got that land and what you paid it with. If you tell them you didn't pay anything, they will tax you on this hand gift you got (e.g. a percentage of the value of that land). If you tell them you paid in bitcoin, they will fine you for not paying taxes on that bitcoin, unless you did of course. If you did there shouldn't be a problem, much like if you paid in cash.

@_date: 2013-03-20 17:11:37
How about this, you go calculate how much taxes you should pay here: 
Then you take out whatever you won't or have ever used use, including your children up until they are 18, and your parents up until you were 18, and you declare your BTC income so that the amount  corresponds to what you calculated. It's the equivalent of what you said?
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:25:52
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:45:17
I'm not a lawyer but this is how I think it goes:
Basically, the rule is as soon as you make money, the IRS wants a piece of that. So yes, any income should be taxed. Of course you shouldn't worry about it too much if it's less than 4 digits.
Also, it depends on where the income comes from, what taxes it will have. If you do a job and are paid in BTC, then that's normal income tax. If you buy BTC low, and then sell it when it's high, that's capital gains tax.

Definitely, I don't think monopolies have ever done any good.
However, it would be hard to seperate the used and the non-used services. I think it would eventually come down to a hidden sales tax. For example, John who doesn't pay for law enforcement because he has his own gun, goes to a store. This store does choose to pay for law enforcement, so it's paying higher taxes. Because there are less people paying for law enforcement, the store is actually paying higher taxes than it would have using the old system. This means the prices of the shop are much higher to make up for the extra taxes.
Of course this again assumes that LE would be as expensive as before. I believe if only a part of the population (let's say 90%) pays for LE, the costs would still be higher than 90% due to inefficiencies and the cost not rising linearly with usage.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:13:30
Anything really. Miners, or if you sell stuff in return for BTC. It's all BTC income. If you earn from buying low and selling high, it's capital gains, but you're correct that unless you sell you shouldn't be taxed.

Yep. If taxes were voluntary I wouldn't pay them, because it would mean they were not necessary, and/or through donations of others the services necessary would be provided for.

Thievery? It's taxes, not thievery.

Democracy is the worst of all systems, except for all the others that we've tried already.

But they wouldn't conform. They'd be laughing and sipping martini!
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:51:41
Yeah I admit I have a hard time explaining what I mean here.
Let's start from the foundation: I *believe* taxes are necessary (for the good of society). Taxes are mandatory. These two things are not linked. 
So we have 4 situations (necessity is here my opinion)
* Taxes are voluntary, but necessary: I do not pay taxes. (1)
* Taxes are mandatory, but necessary: I pay taxes.
* Taxes are voluntary, and not necessary: I do not pay taxes.
* Taxes are mandatory, but not necessary: I pay taxes, but get the fuck out asap.
For situation (1), this is basically just like replacing taxes with donations. I would not feel it fair that taxes which are necessary are voluntary, because I do not believe that man can be selfless. I don't think everyone would pay their fair bit if taxes were voluntarily. To make sure I don't get ripped off and to not enforce such an unfair system, I would not pay taxes. I'm positive that most people would not do it, and this would make the system collapse and be replaced with something else.
It is the tragedy of the commons.
The fact that they are necessary, means they will never become voluntary, because it doesn't make sense to make them so. That's what I'm trying to say with my other ill-explained statement.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:12:38

If we want bitcoin to succeed as a currency, we need to be able to use it to buy things from legal merchants. As soon as the government implements a ban on accepting bitcoin, no legal merchant will touch it, and bitcoin will be relegated to black markets and vice organisations. No matter what ideals individuals might have about it.
No matter if this is a fault of the organization (government) or not, this is the reality.

That is the result of a democracy.




No. Law has nothing to do with being morally just. I never said anything like that. Stop. Putting. Fucking. Words. In my mouth. Learn how to have a reasonable discussion already.
I'm arguing that you do have a choice. You lived for 18 years before you got a real job for the first time, I'm assuming you haven't paid taxes before that. It's not like they're coming after you for taxes for those 18 years. You can even use the services provided by other people's taxes to get out of the country. But as soon as you work, you accept the implied contract that you give a piece of what you earn with that work, to the government. You're free not to work, too. Then you don't pay taxes.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:36:11

The people. We do live in a democratic society.


Because they never consider the poorer people.


There will always be poor people (or at least children) even with unlimited job opportunities. Charity for the dependant, what if it isn't enough? What if there's a newsflash "We need to get $5MM in donations tomorrow or 1000 people will die", and then all the good people donate money, but they only reach $1MM. Won't they point fingers at the ones who didn't donate, and say "hey why aren't you donating?"? You can't expect the few good people to take care of all the poorest ones.


Ah, me neither :(

True points.
However I don't think they would be better or more affordable. I think they would be less affordable, and people who cannot afford them would be left out in the cold, too.
I think that's a big point against private healthcare and education, because it keeps the poor part of society poor, since they can't afford education, or to stay healthy. How would the system as you envision it, make sure that the gap between rich people (i.e. those who can afford education, healthcare, ...) and poor people (those who cannot, and thus can't get good jobs) would not become bigger?

If you suddenly come into possession of a house, and you cannot show what money you bought it with, the IRS will definitely find you and tax you on the value of the house, because you obviously bought it with money you earned but didn't pay taxes on.

Before making this post I didn't even know what a statist was. I believe we do owe the government some of our income, since that income was made using skills we learned during the education the government paid for, while we travel on roads the government paid for, etc. To me, it's like a transaction fee on bitcoins. Why pay the bitcoin miners transaction costs? We don't owe them, really. But they do provide a service we use.
If the entire purpose of Bitcoin was to avoid the evils of a centralized gov currency, why not just use gold.
Bitcoins might be untracable, the things you buy from them aren't.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:54:17
Oh I'm sure they won't be able to stop it on the internet. Nor will they ever be able to trace it between people.
The thing I'm sure they *can* stop, is people who want to remain in good standing (e.g. merchants, normal shops, companies) accepting them in return for goods and services.
These people have accounting and tracable money lines (supplies, rent, ...). They can't just make the origina of their products disappear when they sell you them for bitcoin. The gov comes auditing and they need to prove where those 10% of goods they "didn't" sell (they actually did sell them in return for BTC) went. That's the problem.
Sure, you can hide some of it, but systematically accepting bitcoin would become a problem.

If the currency appreciates, i.e. if you buy 1BTC when it's $10 (with tax-paid money), and then later you sell 1BTC when it's $40, than you made *capital gains* of $30, and need to pay taxes on those $30.

There's a difference between outright banning sales of something, and banning untaxed sales.
Prohibition, War on Drugs, these failed because they completely banned the product. People were still selling alcohol / are still selling drugs because the financial rewards are higher than the risk they take by selling illegal stuff.
As soon as you make selling it legal, but tax it, the reward of selling it untaxed (= the taxrate, say 15%) is too low for the risk incurred (= jailtime, fines).
Basically the merchants will have to choose between taxing what they sell at 15%, or risking jailtime and big fines. The reward at this point just isn't big enough to risk it, so they choose to pay the tax.
Or for bitcoin, if the gov bans them from accepting it, the merchants will have to choose between accepting bitcoin and risking big fines and jailtime, or not accepting them. If so, the merchants that accept bitcoin will ask a huge premium for the risk they take, and normal people will just use normal dollars to buy stuff.
