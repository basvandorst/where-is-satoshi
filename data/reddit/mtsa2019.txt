Eh I guess. But like for example I've been trading pennystocks the past month starting with $500 and I'm at $1100 now. If I had invested in ETFs or actual "investments" then I would have less than $600 still. As long as you trade correctly its immensely more profitable, but yeah, way safer to be an investor.

Never defined freedom, I said give me a country that allows it that has a high population. The fucking tower in the middle of the ocean is 100000% irrelevant considering 99.9999999% of people in existence have never even been to it.

China isnt even relevant, they leech off of the US. 
What has he done negative to France and Germany? Name calling a leaders wife isnt a valid answer. 
Also if you want to say the economy is being juiced you'd have to say the same about obama since it shot up similar to how trumps economy has, except Obama had an entire economic crisis during his terms. 
How is free press not being suppressed by google if they fucking removed a youtube video by project veritas where they do investigative journalism and caught a google executive openly talking about "preventing the next trump situation" and censoring conservatives. And guess what their response was: to censor that video

Or trump gets elected and we have record high economy and stock market. Record low unemployment, and businesses coming back to America but he makes fun of some guys wife so it's the end of the world?

Right. What's the population. Name one country that has free speech on the scale of a country like the Netherlands, UK, russia, china, US, australia, Austria, or really any country with more than a five million people.

You mentioned speaking negatively about the state. You're aware people in NK and China are jailed and killed if they speak negatively of the state right? The first step to creating a dictatorship is eliminating free speech. 


Good. That's exactly what happened with the Russian collusion fiasco. And you know what happened? An investigation. And the investigation found trump innocent. 


Ok then the person can be sued for libel or slander? You literally just described the Brett kavanaugh situation, congratulations. 


Cant speak out against laws if you have no free speech. 


Free speech holds those in office accountable. What happens if the local MP is corrupt? Then you have no option if you dont like a law but to wait for him to leave office. 


That is exactly what free speech SHOULD be. How do you think America was fucking formed? They literally overthrew the british since they were colonies and declared independence. Are you going to jail every person who sings a rap song with the N word? Or every person on twitter who says they hate white people?

Trump isnt retarded, he's probably trying to make the price dip so he can get a discount
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:36:06
They already found no collusion, and no obstruction. Your entire second paragraph is therefore pointless. Second, even if he is trying to stop meddling in 2020 elections, he wouldn't be able to talk about it. Why the fuck would he reveal our plans and announce what we know about countries who are meddling. 
Who cares if nobody has done this "dirt" is name calling another countries presidents wife really dirt to you? Kim Jong un fucking starves his own people, other leaders can handle their wives getting name called. The entire reason trump got elected is because he's not a politician, and he's not PC like everyone else. And it's exactly why he's going to win again
@_date: 2019-07-13 06:49:40
I mean, you'd expect a little more volatility than we saw today after the president of the free world tweeted about it saying he doesnt like it, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:04:24
Yeah there were a few sketchy day trades I did earlier where coinbase pro was saying like 12.5k but robinhood would say 12,350 or coinbase said 12.6k and robinhood says 12,647
Not sure what's going on but I came out positive in the end so I'm gonna stop while I'm at it unless there's a massive dip
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:24:24
Should we be scared? I made a few day trades and profited like .0007 btc but idk if its gonna stabilize or go up/down. Yesterday the order book looked completely normal with like 49% selling and 51% buying pretty consistently throughout the day. Now it's completely random and there's no pattern
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:27:16
Tbf I believe bitcoin itself is a US government operation anyways, otherwise they'd be doing everything they can to stop it
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:21:28
I mean, if they give the information they say they do, and it's impactful as they say it is, then I don't see a problem.

I've been investing and it shows up on my robinhood app so I saw how it was at 9700
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:37:51
Fuck off with the shitty predictions jfc. It could be 30k tomorrow or 1k.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:34:02
I do know what it is and how to do it, I'm worried about laws/taxes specifically for crypto though
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:49:50
If you're strictly investing, and not using bitcoin as a way to pay/sell things then robinhood allows it without commission prices. I think GDAX/Coinbase pro does too
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:56:46
What is this?
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:34:47
2 or 3 day dumping how? It naturally rose to 9,700 so it's unlikely itll dip below that.

Left nut. Also you dont sound cool typing shit like this.
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:17:45

@_date: 2019-06-28 01:56:50
Seems legit, doesn't make sense why they would allow it to dip so much though
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:09:03
Eh, I think that was largely people that had limit sells set for 13k from all the idiots that bought at 15-19k in 2017. Bitcoin is easily gonna hit 25k by EOY, its just a matter of when.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:18:50
Oh fuck so even if I trade A for B and then B for C. And hold onto C for a year, i still have to pay the full amount of tax for A and B? RIP. 
And then I guess the 25k limit is to cover robinhoods profits since they dont have commission fees
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:12:11
Went from 19k, sold at 16k for a win. Then I saw it drop to like 4500 and stay there for months and figured it wasn't coming back
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:38:10
I forgot that was a thing, but yea
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:29:21
You realize bitcoin isnt supposed to be income right? It's an entire movement that's supposed to turn into an everyday currency. The profits are just a bonus. Your entire post is horseshit and nobody should be thinking if making bitcoin their primary income.
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:00:41
Yea I pretty much knew all of that. The big question I had though - with day trading stocks you need a minimum 25k in your account and you pay extra taxes. I was trying to figure out if the taxes and 25k apply to bitcoin too or just stock.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:25:28
Is this legit or did you pull it out of your ass? Cause if legit, I'm gonna sell at 11600 and buy after it dips again
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:40:28
Yea. I mean right now I'm young enough to lose the ~1k I have in bitcoin and just be like "yea I guess that sucks" 
I just wish more places accepted it as payment.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:13:02
I mean not really. If you have more bitcoin sure, but I ended up with more bitcoin than I had before
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:17:53
Yea I mean it's about $20 but I'm pretty sure day trading tax for my tax bracket is like 20% anyways so I'm not too worried. Either way, profit is profit since I'm (technically) broke. 
Plus that .0014 is $20 now but if bitcoin doubles which I think it will, that $20 will be $40 and then like $35 after taxes and fees
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:14:59
Yea I have coinbase but the title wasn't a meme. Like if its 3am and I'm asleep and bitcoin drops 2000 I want a fucking nuclear alarm going off
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:02:03
Ok even if you think Iran is the reason prices are skyrocketing why the fuck would you want to donate to them? You realize their government encourages terrorism right?
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:50:28
As soon as it drops a few hundred. I don't have a lot of disposable income so I wanna work my way up to hopefully holding an entire bitcoin by buying whenever its about to spike and selling whenever its about to dip

It is a shitcoin. The only good altcoin IMO is XLM and XRP. Maybe XMR.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:55:02
A lot of people would still use it. If people wouldn't use it even when there aren't gains to be made, it would have never recovered from when it dipped from 19k to 4.5k

I use robinhood so 0% gud but I want ATM fees to be less than 1.5 so I can physically own the bitcoin

@_date: 2019-06-26 19:56:06
Well I'm trading on robinhood and it seems like they only buy/sell to other robinhood users. So when there's a mass drop I have like 5 seconds to sell before the robinhood sell will reflect that drop. But there's also spread so it has to drop significantly for there to be any profit
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:15:24
Because I have no friends
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:46:11
Yea I wasn't gonna do anything insane. I bought in at 9,700 and wanted to set a stop loss for 10k. I'm not worried about a 1-3k dip, I'm worried about it going to like 5k overnight
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:52:17
I mean, I got in at 9700 and it's at 10,600 now. I'll take my $7 profits rather than risking all my money

I think honestly if it ever does hit 100k like people want, then 25k is gonna be like the 4.5 that bitcoin was after the 19k dip
