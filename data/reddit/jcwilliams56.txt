I don't know why there has been an assumption that regulation/ETF being approved/Gemini = price increases.  The market reacted/adjusted for these events two years ago.  The nice price bubble will come when mass adoption starts to actually happen.  As long as the average Joe doesn't see a reason to go through the trouble of buying a single bit, the market will most likely remain static.

I bought a honeymoon flight to the French Riviera with Bitcoin last month and surprised my fiancee at Christmas....very easy and it was the cheapest price I found.

Well I think we've officially hit a plateau.  Imagine how big this news would have been three months ago??  Now - meh.
It's going to take something really, really big to push BTC one way or another at this point.

I work in a high school and I coach a few sports.  When I asked some what they thought of bitcoin, almost all of them had heard of it and many said it makes total sense.  To them, money has been in a digital form all of their life.
I also know a kindergarten teacher who said most of her students can no longer even recognize coins (pennies, quarters, etc) as money.  She said this is a huge difference from even five years ago.  To those kids, money only exists on a phone, on a card, or through bills given to you by a machine.
Edit:  This is all in New York City

I agree - the first two commercials were on par with what Microsoft put out in the 80's.
I'm watching the game with my family - we have some family friends at UCF - and when the first two commercials came on my dad says, "well, that was really stupid."  He owns some bits, so he is not exactly a skeptic, but he doesn't follow the news religiously like most of us do.  His opinion was that it came off as pretty lame, and I tend to agree.
Also, BitPay bought a college bowl...if you can afford a college bowl, you can afford to knock it out of the park with the commercial.

@_date: 2014-03-18 00:26:14
Thankfully I did not, but I imagine a lot did.  If this is true how is it not getting more attention?  This was a pretty high-profile marketing campaign
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:36:54
Actually, I do not doubt that one of out of every 200 people over 18 have an account.  The number makes sense at this time.

Isn't Forbes the same source that broke the story about Fortress getting involved...?
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:21:54
I thought this was worth posting - I am seeing more and more bitcoin articles in magazines that aren't based around business, money, or technology.

Well I moved it into my betcoin poker address 5 minutes later and it went through instantly...so ostensibly I was able to play online poker within five minutes after purchasing bitcoin with my credit card.  No issues at all.

Fuck. Yes.

I don't think people realize how huge this really is
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:21:42
This is actually good news
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:42:03
Please correct me if I'm missing something...and I hope I am.
Here is what I gather:
- If someone is in the US, they still cannot use this platform to play poker
- If someone is in the EU (or anywhere else), they don't need to use this platform to play poker when trusted entities like partypoker and pokerstars exist
- To promote this idea, you are using a bunch of poker pros who were popular 15 years ago.  This tells me the poker interface is a priority.  To whom are you trying to appeal?  The US player who can't play anyway or the EU player who doesn't care.  What's the incentive?
Outside of poker, why would someone in the US use this platform for fantasy sports when Fanduel/Draftkings is offering million dollar paydays?  Casino is off the table as well. Esports?  What does that even mean?  I just don't see the draw unless you open up a US facing poker platform.

Agreed - again, I think it's really cool and all, but the initial comments were making it seem as if these were the best commercials of all time.
It's a really good start and they were definitely fine, but we have a long way to go. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:10:57
It's not that they know something we don't, it's that that is where the real money is.

Should note - it's initially a weekly limit of $500 usd but I'm assuming this changes once you are verified and / or once they start growing...similar to what coinbase did

Do you remember in 1996 when you wanted to sign onto AOL but you had to use your dial up modem?  It would give all sorts of crazy sounds and then eventually connect...or not.  Even when it did connect it would take 30 seconds for each web page to load, but that was okay but it was still really fucking cool and you knew that someday, a day not too far in the future, this would happen immediately.
That's about where bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-01-22 01:41:20
huh?  Looks dumb.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:17:15
Also done.  It took me 30 seconds, tops.

I've never been impressed with this guy, including the post auction press conference

Also, there was a "RyanG" who scammed hundreds of BTC using the fake company "Coinpal," which had an IPO posted on cryptostocks.
Not sure if it's the same guy, but the thread is worth the read if anyone is interested in trying to make the connection.  IIRC they found out the guy was from Florida...

I know everyone will get themselves in a tizzy over this, but I didn't think the first two commercials were well done.  Bad acting, poor production, really bad acting, etc.
They had a chance to knock it out of the park with the first one, and they just showed some really cheesy clips of a keyboard and people in an office.  For God sakes, explain why people should even care about Bitcoin, not that you want a million customers.
That said, it's really awesome to see BitPay on ESPN, no matter the commercial quality.  Third one was also pretty funny.

The # of allowable transactions a day is not putting a cap on bitcoin going mainstream.  The # of reasons the average person wants to own bitcoin is the issue.

If you don't need the car, buy the bitcoin.  You are in high school and have you whole life to make more money.  If it works, genius, if it doesn't, not a big deal.  One day you'll have a family...that's when you buy the car.

No, but some of these projects have 1,000+ people in their communities.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that they develop some great things that help people understand/want to use cryptocurrency.  Some of these networks are loaded with many, many developers who are all contributing in their own way.
Labeling them all shitcoins because 95% are pure scams is a fallacy, IMO.  I'm not saying that we should invest in these coins or buy the assets, but I am saying that some top-class innovation here could definitely add excitement in a bull market.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:24:49
If things progress like this until mid-summer, we could have a perfect storm of user-friendly and trustworthy exchanges, favorable regulations, additional VC funding for startups, and another halvening on the horizon.
We may also see one of the major alt-coin ecosystems (ethereum, CP, SuperNet, etc...) develop an actual product that heads towards mainstream adoption.  That could be a game-changer as well.  Exciting times...

I'm not a huge fan of Jersey City, but it's actually pretty nice now...it's come a long way in 10 years.  A ton of young Wall Street professionals live there now to avoid NYC rent and city tax, and a plethora of bars/clubs/beer gardens have popped up.  I would think this would be exactly the kind of place (young-ish, intelligent) where the crowd would be really into bitcoin.

Just say, "For Open Bazaar to be as awesome as we all want it to be, please allow up to 30 seconds before continuing.  Here is something to help you pass the time:"
And then put up a video of something funny or a even a promo of Open Bazaar.
Don't worry about grandma using this right away.  It's going to be a bunch of nerds for a while.  When this goes mainstream then you can worry about people leaving before 20 seconds are up.

In early 2013 I was an English teacher in my late 20's, and I had never voted anything but democrat.  I bought 10 bitcoins between $50-$100 so I could play some internet poker.
Since then I've moved into an operations strategy position in education, hodl'd my coins, taught myself a couple programming languages so I can work on some side projects, and joined Ron Paul's mailing list.
And, of course, I f'around on reddit in my spare time.
So that's a long way of saying:  "I agree."
