Listen, if all you're concerned about is a significant price rise, go to If on the other hand you're looking for mass adoption so as to disrupt the government and put the power of money back into the peoples' hands, then you're in the right place.
The 'price per Bitcoin' will probably be the most crucial factor. If the general population sees it's worth $15,432/BTC then they'll be like, "this is some serious business."
But what's more important than the price is general adoption. It's important to get this amazing technology to everyone. When that happens, then we'll likely see the price in BTC rise significantly. But what would truly be best is not $10,000/BTC or $100,000/BTC but rather 1BTC = 1BTC because that's the primary currency people use.

Bitcoin as a technology is incredible and price is probably the least interesting thing about it.


Bitcoin (the protocol), to the best of my knowledge, isn't being double-spent or anything else. Transaction malleability, an issue that affects the exchanges but not the protocol is for the most part fixed.


What are they hacking? Exchanges? They'll come and go, but so long as no one 'hacks' Bitcoin (whatever that means...) Bitcoin will be fine.


This has been a concern since sub $1. Yet here we are with $500 coins. You tell me, has volatility killed Bitcoin?
All of these things happen more or less simultaneously all the time (bar the price *increasing*), it's just coupled with a price drop **currently** and therefore we have hacks like you claiming the end of Bitcoin.
STFU. Leave. The people who will make Bitcoin succeed will be better off without the naysayers not contributing.

Certainly they did, but they were well established business who've been operating in an industry with centralization that has existed for hundreds of years. 
Bitcoin was created in 2009 and has to innovate in a decentralized environment. It's certainly unfair to expect Bitcoin to be on par with the modern banking industry after 5 years. That being said, the fact it's much more secure than the current system after only 5 years indicates a lot of improvements ought to be made in the modern banking system.
Do I have a projected year that Bitcoin can compete with money of 20 years ago [that had the advantage of a large-scale industry infrastructure in place already]? No I don't, and it may not ever compete, but don't knock Bitcoin for trying to improve in places where improvement is needed.

I'm sure the people writing Bitcoin articles, at least a decent portion, understand Bitcoin enough to portray it accurately in the media. Whether or not they actually do is another story entirely.

I have no words. Actually, I do. Its not like the free market isn't a democracy itself. Except in that democracy you participate if you want and are punished on your own merit and not by the will of others. Like the Gox debacle. No government, by the will of the majority of its people, came and destroyed it and caused thousands of bitcoin to get tied up.


In the most strict side of government we have countless examples of some harming others with little to no recourse. On the other hand, at least redress can be brought against people and corporations in a market. No system of government can guarantee the safety and security of others, but actors of the State often have immunity from recourse. Can you even count the number of articles posted here on reddit where the police do something brutal, illegal, and morally reprehensible and then keep their jobs?

I was giving a simplified explanation. The likelihood of generating a private key that corresponds to a wallet with inputs in it is  astronomically small as it's essentially zero.

@_date: 2014-02-01 22:09:57
Thank you for answering! I'm still a bit confused but on a new part now. So by adding a bunch of transactions plus the block reward and creating a hash yields a number too large, do you have to take out one transaction and try to add another? What if the none of the pending-transactions in any combination are less than the difficulty number?
I realize this is a silly concern as the number of pending transactions increases over a short amount of time and the difficulty can be adjusted weekly (I think) to make sure blocks are added to the blockchain.
See I figured miners put together in ascending to descending order the mining-reward values first. Hypothetically only 4 transactions/block are allowed and one is the block reward. The other three are 100BTC, 99BTC, and 98BTC. Wouldn't all miners put it in that order first? Since the current block reward is 12.5BTC.
Why can't a miner block reward themselves more than 12.5? Are block rewards in a block in some way different and recognizable? If that's the case, would the network just reject anything except 12.5?
What happens when the mining-rewards are bigger than the block rewards? Do people stop competing for the block-rewards because putting blocks together with mining-rewards are more valuable? How do the last bitcoins get mined?
Sorry for throwing so much at you!

Well until there are so many exchanges that they're a dime a dozen, it will force buyers/and sellers to concentrate around the few that exists. That's just the fact of the matter in the current world of Bitcoin.
Also, there is no Bitcoin stock exchange. There are bitcoin exchanges where people exchange bitcoin, but bitcoin isn't a stock, its arguably money, but more like a commodity for now, and generally speaking it's a software program. Maybe one day there will be bitcoin stock exchanges but as for now I'm not sure exactly what that means. Just a clarifying point.
Another thing, I'm not sure you understand how bitcoin works. You said that it's on their [the exchanges'] machines. Yes and no. The blockchain (the public ledger) is shared and stored by every node in the bitcoin network. But the coins aren't saved like an mp3 file on the exchange's computers. The way I understand it is, you sell your bitcoin to the exchange and their custom software converts it to their version of bitcoin which people trade and sell and then the exchange sends bitcoin to your wallet when you want bitcoin or sends cash to your banking institution when you want cash. As for the way bitcoin works, a bitcoin is basically an agreement amongst all nodes saying you have certain inputs in your public key and when you send them they (or a portion of them) become outputs from you to inputs to another public key that everyone agrees to. Your private key allows you access to the inputs to push forward as outputs.

**tl;dr**: Yes, but this isn't a problem that exists because of Bitcoin, but because of the glaring problems in the current system Bitcoin works within.
1. Drug trade is a victimless crime. If it weren't a crime, a lot of the organized crime that's associated with it would disappear with it.
2. While Bitcoin was used to fund international organized crime syndicates to include drug trading, it pales in comparison to how many drugs and people are trafficked using the USD or fiat currencies in general.
3. While human trafficking and the suffering because of the War on Drugs is by no means a small issue, I believe its consequences heretofore are dwarved in comparrison to the war, suffering, carnage, and death that have been caused at the hands of the government. Governments that, by the way, use fiat currencies that fractionalize in order to steal wealth to pay for the warfare.

The same reasons that makes democracy a poor system for any sizable population would also extend to moderators on reddit. Not only are there inherent problems in any democratic system, but an internet forum would be subject to other problems like vote brigading, selection bias, etc.
As the saying goes, people vote with their feet. While established subreddits have an advantage in garnering and retaining users, look at how is a successful subreddit. No one needed to vote for moderators, they just created a better counterpart to We have a democratic process for content quality, and look how shitty that turns out often times.

No. **The definition of money has not changed, the structure of our economy has.** Gold became much more valuable and trying to shave off a few sprinkles of gold dust for a pack of gum became unreasonable.

Just because economic value isn't distributed evenly among everyone doesn't mean inequality is a bad thing. No matter what the state can try to do, economic inequality is just going to happen, and trying to allocate resources for such an end would be economically wasteful.
Yes there are reasons some people will be left behind on the race to wealth, but let me ask you: in a completely free market, if you were to get rich, would you choose to leave your poor family and friends just as poor? If you believe that the poor, hungry, and destitute will be left uncared for in a completely free market, you probably believe that with wealth comes evil and with that I disagree.

Currently it's not deflationary, so that may be where it's confusing. Inflationary money loses value over time. $1 in 1980 bought more then than it does now. 
The amount of bitcoin is indeed increasing with time, but if it steadily gains value over the next 100 years, fewer and fewer will be mined. Some will be lost forever due to mishandling. And if it's gaining value while slowing in growth you will be able to buy more goods and services in the future with your bitcoin then you could at that present time.

2. OMG Doge**coin** is so funny amirite?!?!?!?1? 
3. This is a great community, we're so much better than Bitcoin
4. There's no way that any of this money I've invested into Dogecoin will ever be worth anything. But Bitcoin is just like it, but better albeit not as fun
5. This 'cryptocurrency' peer-to-peer network that removes banking from the hands of the elite is a seriously fantastic idea.
I think that using memes (as much as I hate Doge now) is what's gonna bring our most important customers into Bitcoin. Without the veneer of humor and all that, I think it's a much harder sell for cryptocurrencies.

Why were so many in a hot wallet? Why wasn't the balance being watched and compared to transaction and sales volume? If they were in cold storage you can still have a 'watch wallet' and if coins moved from a cold storage wallet then things should really be alarming.

You've established a hypothetical I (and reasonable people) wouldn't allow myself to get into. First of all, the free market wouldn't use fiat "Federal Reserve Notes" as currency. Secondly, because of that, the economy you describe wouldn't exist.
If a major bank did that, it's likely other banks would step in. A bank run on one major bank would scare consumers into runs on other banks. They would likely buy out or bail out the major bank to avoid having to raise interest rates on deposits because people would be weary of depositing their money.

Let's discuss your comment here.
You bring up the cloud access and 'simple digital transfers.' 
Then you sarcastically call Bitcoin futuristic and then cite paper wallets as a way to dig at Bitcoin not being as futuristic as it seems.
Okay, let's tackle the modern money storage part first. In order for either of these services to work with any level of security, encryption is required. However, and although I'm no expert, there are probably different vulnerabilities between when you login to your computer and when the recipient of your money has received the cash.
Now, paper wallets can be created with so little as a dice, pen, and sheet paper. The only way to recover the stored funds is to actually HAVE the private key, or literally guess until you die. And while most probably don’t create paper wallets THAT secure, it is still vastly more difficult to steal funds from a cold wallet than through Trojan horses, frustrated bank-employees, social engineering tricks, hackers, etc.
Now, let’s back up even a bit more! Don’t forget that you’re comparing apples to oranges. In the modern banking example, you’re actually exchanging money; in the paper wallet critique you’re simply storing it. If you want to compare each on their merits, you should actually compare their parallel functions, and not the easily caricaturized components.

The moral hazard created by the existence of the FDIC probably costs more economically than the free market would, but it's hard to see the forest for the trees when, as a consumer, the FDIC lulls us into thinking what they do helps us.
Sure, the FDIC insures your money, but it would likely not have to be lost if banks were required by the free market to keep adequate cash reserves or sink. I guess most people would rather see banks become too big to fail because of the shockingly low reserve requirements that help build mega-banks.
It's a trade off, a few people lose their money but the economy goes through business cycles more mildly or we have recession after recession at the cost of production and unemployment.
I'm not saying it isn't tragic when the little guy loses his money, but I am saying there are trade offs.

No because the other 49% of the network can still solve hashes and publish them. The 51% can try to solve the next block so as to input their version of the blockchain but they have to beat out the 49% each block. They have a 51% chance of doing that, which is still like a coin flip chance and as another user said, it would destroy the value of the money you purchased by breaking the protocol rather than mining a shit ton of btc and earning block rewards.

The big investment banks were also a huge part of the global financial economy. They weren't allowed to fail. MtGox was. It was said if they failed it would be catastrophic for global finance. MtGox, being essentially Bitcoin, failed but the system went on albeit with a limp for now.

You can do it with less. In fact you can try to do it with one node, but the odds of getting away with it are astronomically small that it's practically zero.
Essentially, you have to create a block and solve the hash quicker than the entire network. Having 51% of the network means you have a 51% chance of submitting a double spent block.

It takes you longer to drive to Walmart/BestBuy/whatever, pick out your TV, transport it home than the 10 extra minutes that a business will want you to stick around to make sure your transaction is included in the Blockchain. What's more, is Bitcoin reduces the risk of a 'chargeback' per se, after 10 minutes, unlike Paypal or Visa where the chargeback can happen 60 days later.
You give up 9min 30sec extra to pay for your TV. Hopefully this TV is slightly discounted because it costs less to process the transaction than a credit card, and you're not using fiat currency. In exchange the business mitigates a lot of risk.

I wouldn't say you're wrong about the need to save money but it's not on its face that simple. Economists want people to start saving more money in banks to stimulate investment in entrepreneurship. If the Fed didn't exist but we had no savings then banks would increase savings account rates. Again, without savings businesses would complete over a very small amount of money in the banks for loans and the interest rate would be sky high. Because of that rate, they could afford to pay higher interest to depositors. 
Money, too, is subject to supply and demand without distortion from the Federal Reserve. If people stuffed their money in mattresses (cold storage) then investment would be much more difficult (again, assuming no Fed). Banks would have to be able to give higher rates of return on deposits than you could otherwise get by holding your Bitcoin.

I'm not really sure what the end game for Bitcoin is. I can't imagine it being a world currency. I think Bitcoin effectively takes away the power of any government to tax and therefore fund itself. I don't think governments could adopt it as a currency.
Will it be a commodity? Maybe. If it becomes so valuable it's only used to transfer wealth, then it ceases to become a currency really and acts more like M2 or M3. I feel it would lose a lot of its inherent value as a day-to-day currency if that were the case.
I'm not sure what to think, just hoping people chime in with great insight.

When people make trades it changes the price in the trading platforms. I think Coinbase does it by trying to balance their cash and bitcoin. Too many bitcoin and it sends a price signal that says, "people are trying to get rid of 'em, let's discount to get more cash," and vice versa. Too low and people see this valuable, digital currency at a discount. There's a LOT more to it than that that I surely don't understand. Check out maybe?

There's a contingency of bitcoiners who want to get Bitcoin under the regulatory microscope in order to establish it so it can go mainstream and assume their view of the currency is the "right" and only way. 
I can make your point sound dumb too. It's a matter of opinion and while I don't respect the people crying for government I do respect their right to have an opinion without immediately dismissing it whenever I mention/discuss it.


We don't necessarily want to keep it niche, we just don't want it ultimately squandered by the government because it has a tendency to use a hammer as its only tool to deal with all size of nails, screws, nuts, and bolts. How often should a hammer be used on a screw?

I would recommend [reading this, it's tax guidance and it's pretty comprehensive while being simple to understand.]( The gist I got from it was that, yes, if you liquidate you need to pay capital gains. If you sell for an object, you have to realize the gain and then pay your capital gains tax on that. If you do other things with Bitcoin like exchange for currencies like Yen, USD, Euro, etc., you probably fall under different tax laws.
If you don't end up generating a 1098, then it's unlikely the government will find out you realized gains, but that's not an excuse not to pay them. Take that sentence as you may.

As the other user has pointed out, it's decentralized. There is no one point of failure like perhaps a bank's vault.
It also offers pseudonymity. You can buy drugs with it anonymously or you can use it to keep track of where your money came from and where it went. Very versatile in this sense.
Additionally, you can send any value of Bitcoin you want anywhere in the world asking no one person or government's permission. Right now can you move a million dollars across a border without asking permission? No. But you can move millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. 
As a part of this, it's also good for remittances. While your average Joe may resemble your father, uncle, our neighbor, there are millions of average Joes who are immigrants in foreign lands seeing to send money home to their loved ones and this is a much cheaper and better way than Western Union.
Lastly, while it may not beat out the USD in terms of strength, it beats many currencies and has the potential to replace bad ones like the bolivar.

People just say that Bitcoin is the primary cryptocurrency right now, but in 10 years it might not be, but *a* cryptocurrency will be. I always thought that was silly because Bitcoin has a head start in terms of price, development, market share, adoption, etc. Basically, "why would we leave Bitcoin?"
But if the core developers start getting pressured to do things not in the best interest of freedom, transparency, privacy, etc. then a competitor of Bitcoin would swoop up a lot of people who are concerned with those issues.

Why not? Because they only have legitimacy because the US Government is the world police. The USD isn't the reserve currency of the world because it's very valuable.

We've demonstrated we're willing to invade countries to secure that.

I can't speak for the whole community but for myself what i see when I see a bubble is a larger share of adoption. I see Bitcoin as a fundamentally good thing for consumers and merchants and a price increase signals more people breaking free from fractional reserve, inflationary money. Yeah it'll be nice if I  get rich, but even if the price stays the same but the world manages to get in on it, I think humanity will be better off.
In short, I think a bubble isn't necessarily just speculative price inflation, but rather a signal of coming economic liberty.

@_date: 2014-02-04 21:58:09
There's a lot that goes into that answer. I'll attempt to give my best answer but it's likely a bit inaccurate and short.
1) Bitcoin is a one-of-a-kind, first-of-its-kind digital currency. It's cryptographic properties allowed it to solve a problem many computer scientists and game theorists had been stumped about how to solve for a long time. The long and short, though, is that they managed to voluntarily solicit help for a decentralized digital network with a system that rewards participants.
2) Because it's anonymous/pseudonymous, it's a valuable way to transmit money secretly. This is good for people who sell drugs, guns, etc. It's also good for people who don't want to be tracked by their government or other entity.
3) It already has value. That's a stupid answer, I'm sorry, but it's also true. Because of the first two things, it grew in value. Well now people give it value the same way they give the USD value, because a large group of people collectively believe some magic internet money has worth, suddenly it does. Ask yourself why you trust the dollars in your pocket. Ultimately it boils down to: "because everyone else does."
I suspect there are far more reasons, and I hope someone chimes in. I hope it wasn't inaccurate, and I don't think it is, but again, if it is, I hope someone chimes in.

My understanding is that when they run them through the merkle root, the run a SHA256 hash on them so it's definitely going to be different.
They incorporate them by how many days destroyed and transaction fees. There's no time advantage as it's supposed to take on average 10 minutes to solve a block, the more blocks you add together the higher your transaction fees will be, too many transactions and you risk your block being orphaned. When you solve your block you broadcast to the network that you have the longest chain, everyone restarts with your chain and then you no longer have a time advantage.

"This is actually good news."
Can you explain *why* they're more likely to buy if they feel it should be prohibited? It seems counter-intuitive. "This is a dangerous, disruptive technology, we should ban it but I also want to own some of it thereby raising my legal culpability."
If on the other hand, you mean that future users as in people who know nothing now, it goes off of their radar, then when the tech develops in 3-5 years they eventually end up customers anyway... how is that different than when they want to ban it and the product never pans out?
If calls for prohibition are buy-signals, how? On one hand you have counter-intuitive logic, and on the other you don't have a well-defined reason for why Bitcoin (or other socially disruptive products) should increase in value except, "sometimes products succeed others fail, therefore any call for prohibition is a buy signal."

While I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin I gotta be honest that right now Bitcoin fails to be a currency but I won't say it can never be one. There is a standard definition of money that is commonly used and one will not be hard pressed to find one. Fungible, store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. While bitcoin *is* valuable it is certainly not a store of value, as you might expect this is because of its volatility which I hope decreases.
What you said about the definition of money is wrong. You're right money changed over time but its definition did not. Gold, bank notes, and fiat currency all fit this definition at some point for one reason or another. The definition didn't change, just what we use.

We don't *owe* you anything. Catchy add, I guess, because you're one of many who have their *own* post just because of the ad.
Still, if you *have* a wallet, you're already a lot further than a lot of people.
["The 13 Weirdest Things You Can Buy With Bitcoin."]( There's a lot you can do with bitcoin already, and there's a lot still left to the future. As more merchants accept it, the more valuable the currency will be. A currency's value only reflects the value of goods and services in an economy. If you want your bitcoins to be worth a lot (or more generally accepted), talk to merchants and people you do business with, and request that they accept bitcoin.
You can earn more by mining, or buying it. Mining I know next-to-nothing about. You need really expensive computing hardware that essentially uses your electricity as a gas tank. To be profitable, you will need to mine more bitcoin than you use in electricity. You can join a guild, mine as one unit, and then split the plunder.
If you want to go the easy route, go with coinbase.com. It's what I use. It takes a few days for transfers of fiat to btc and back but it seems to be the easiest for me to use. There are *many* ways to acquire Bitcoin though. You can try localbitcoins.com, though I think they're anyway from $1-40 more expensive/bitcoin in person. Not sure the reason why.
Now that I've given you a bit of an explanation, I hope you don't feel *owed* anything anymore.

Yes and no, right now the USD is the reserve currency for a few reasons, but mostly because of the petrodollar. Most people compare currencies between each other but measure value in terms of dollars.
A "good deal" is all relative to how you and the good you're trying to purchase found its way to each other. Because of the supply or availability some goods are naturally more expensive when compared to USD/Euro/Pound but prices might be higher in England because of the productive means of England and Europe.
@_date: 2013-03-14 01:08:33
Okay, well I'm asking then, when goods will be priced in absolute terms of BTC. This doesn't really address the question I had with regards to how BTC will end up its own independent currency or the reserve currency.

This is why a lot of people around this sub encourage spending the money instead of hoarding it. If I spent a bitcoin on a new computer, I'd have the same value of bitcoin but it will be as a computer. The other person maybe didn't have any bitcoin before, and now they have some. It's also important to note that if one person hoarding a bunch of bitcoin slowly gets rid of some of theirs, more people can hold/use it making its value increase both in the bitcoins they have and the bitcoin they gave away/spent.

You could sell now, buy again after the bubble pops. Be able to buy more BTC at a price lower than currently. Rinse, repeat.

[According to this chart, though it's volatile, as BTC increases in value you're losing equity.](
If you have a fixed ratio you're subject to market changes. What I'm asking is not when individuals will make the decision to price their goods in terms of BTC but when society does. Even if some of society sticks with Euro, Dollars, Yuan, Yen, etc., when will BTC ***become*** the world reserve currency?

I commented on another poster earlier today. Someone was upset their order was cancelled because coinbase flagged it as a risky transaction. I purchased at $91 and received mine at $127. I, too, had a positive (but slow) experience with coinbase.

I would take the comment feed on the bottom and make it one of two columns underneath of what your price and stuff is.
[Here's a god-awful diagram.](

I locked in at $91.91 (I know, I should've bought sooner). The bitcoin arrived a few hours ago, and as you are probably aware, they're not work $91.91 right now. They 'lost' money giving me my bitcoin at the rate I bought them for instead of $127 at 0100 23APR13.
Hypothetically, if you had bought now and the price crashed, you could cancel your order, so in some way, they're taking a risk holding Bitcoin.

Yeah that kind of ticked me off. He said he doesn't understand it, and then made ignorant claims of someone just changing the algorithm willy nilly to double the number of bitcoins. *If* such a thing were true, someone would have done so. As we can see from the current government system, inflating a currency is profitable for the people who inflate it.

Currently the US creates [$2 million of debt per minute]( or $20 million every ten. It's obviously not the same as money creation but that does help put it into prospective. Also, $500,000 every 10 minutes divided amongst an entire mining guild or all of the services and goods available to purchase in bitcoin is an important factor not to overlook. I also think another commenter pointed out that a block will have halved a few times by then.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:08:33

Wrong, those are two out of the three properties of money. Medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value must be inherent of a commodity before it can become money. This kind of invalidates a lot of what you're saying but I see what you're getting at.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:14:51
I bought when they were $90 and when they dropped into my account it was at $140. They lock in a rate, that's what you agree to when you buy from them. Be patient, dude.

Why not both? You could still get your 2.something% cash back from paypal (5% - 2.something = 2.something). But you'd also have customers willing to pay in btc. 
If you're trying to deliberately keep your payments in paypal, so as to collect cash-back on *every* purchase, I think you're looking at it wrong. I'm willing to bet btc will be more valuable in the future than all of your cash-back.
Also, you'll find some people who are very willing to purchase stuff from you with btc just because of the novelty of it all.
@_date: 2013-03-14 01:06:45
Is it possible that BTC might just be a fad in the tech area and never grows outside of that? If so I don't think it ever could become valuable without the USD.

I have a question: I have a hard time explaining Bitcoin the way a youtube video does. Is there like a 3-5 sentence monologue that's simple and easy to remember that hits on the three points a merchant/consumer would want to know that's also convincing? What would I say?

Can't argue with that.
@_date: 2013-03-14 01:14:08
If you're selling BTC you can price in other ways than fiat currencies. You can produce necklaces and value it in terms of fish, tobacco, gold, talent shows or whatever you want but real money must be a unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange. Fiat currencies are problematic which is why they've given rise to BTC and gold/silver have retained value for thousands of years. Fiat is the problem, BTC isn't fiat.

[It's been volatile in the past]( but it has grown significantly in value rather rapidly. Good news for early investors, bad news for late investors who are looking to short. Hold on for a few months/years and it'll definitely lose a lot of volatility. However, if you cash out now, you can buy back in later, play this game until you observe volatility evaporating.
@_date: 2013-03-05 21:52:06

There are three kinds of currencies: commodity, representative, and fiat and all three types of currency must meet the three principles of money that being what I listed.

Secretary Nopalitano, here's a few scary stories about what criminals have done with BTC. We want to know what you know about it, what strategies you have for it, and what communication at the federal, state, and local level you have regarding BTC. Also, we want to start an exchange-traded fund with the SEC so traditional investors can get involved.
