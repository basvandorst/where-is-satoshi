The sender is always sending the same amount of money, you just pay more fees if it's sent as a payment. Try sending customers invoices instead of just letting them send you cash. I think that way it's definately recorded as a sale. 
Best thing yet is to just ditch Paypal. Fuckers stole my money on multiple occasions.

Not saying it's a good thing, just saying it might turn out better for their customers. And besides, who the hell sells their coins at Gox now? It's not like you can get the money out. It's market manipulation, but the market is dead.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:34:31
Even with a source, it doesn't mean shit.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:20:39
But people had to deposit before they bought any BTC... No way 90% of the people got their money out.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:34:57
So if this plan moves forward, I (and everybody else) can withdraw all of my cash within a reasonable timeframe? Somehow I don't believe that. They're going to pay themselves with our cash and in the end, we'll get even less (or nothing).
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:20:10
Makes sense, thanks. Just got online and this was the first I saw about it.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:42:30
There were a few class action suits of people that wanted to get their cash out before gox filed for bankrupcy.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:48:22
This is what I thought too. Most people will be wondering what you're gaining from it and probably won't trust it.
@_date: 2014-06-28 10:02:38
It was like 2 days ago, I think we all were.

No way he still has them on there without a plan to get every single one out.

Spoken with the flawless logic of someone who does have kids. It's not because you try to shield your child from drugs, that drugs don't exist. People should stop using and talking about it because you're too lousy a parent to talk to your kids about it?

I automatically did.

And today:




So, yeah...

Even if you use commas as delimiter, if you see three zero's, it's pretty obvious that he means 180k, not 180.
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:34:39
Isn't this a good thing for people that still have money in Gox? Now they might actually be solvable.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:23:51
It will never gain widespread acceptance though. Most people will see it as a pyramid scheme and won't buy out of fear of Satoshi selling another batch of coins and running away with everyone's cash.
@_date: 2014-09-27 14:55:48
That's why you always get a rough estimation first... (9 x 10^11 ) / (7 * 10^6 ) has to be somewhere in the 10^5 range, not 10^9 ...

How is a huge ledger of every single transaction ever made not complete surveillance? Link a few addresses to a few names and they don't even need the drugs/weapons/whatever to convict them.

I don't know man, 800 million is getting pretty close to 2bil.

Because I (and a lot of others with me) am not convinced that there actually are (external) thieves.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:46:58
Exactly. Even if you're not used to the system, it's just multiples of 1k, how hard can it be?
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:25:43
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:56:45
I didn't say that. I said if the creator swoops in and sells all of his bitcoins, making the price crash to mere cents, people might think that.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:02:18
I don't feel this is nitpicking. Do you really want Bitcoin to be associated with companies like this? If I was one of their unhappy "customers" getting an email about BTC, I'd never start accepting them.
@_date: 2014-08-26 11:48:43
So around 0.6BTC a day? When do you expect to break even?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:57:03
Wait, Karpeles reposted this?
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:16:03
Not if 99% of the customers want their money and BTC back...
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:42:26
No effort? Haven't you seen the dozens of BTC movement threads?
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:17:54
It doesn't support anything to be honest. All of those numbers are the sums of user balances. Their internal ledgers are probably a completely different database or are offline.
The only thing this shows is that when people logged in to the site, they saw the right amount of bitcoins they thought they had. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 09:10:30
It'll probably be in about two weeks™.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:58:51
Except bitcoins aren't legally currency.
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:08:41
I've never even heard of fuddruckers and thought it was some strange kind of self-censorship... But I've never heard the word ruddfucker either so I was confused as hell.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:14:45
Where did he say that? 
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:03:15
Keyword being 'in our communications"?
@_date: 2013-09-30 18:05:32
What's the difference between this and buying BTC yourself? I don't know much about economy and genuinely don't see the difference, except that you need $25k to do it this way.

What does Coinbase have to do with Paypal being scamming little bitches that reverse transactions as soon as the buyer notices a scratch?
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:05:35
Same could be said about the employer: "The system stops working when employers are selfish and cheap and decide that the person running their ass off for them for an hour isn't worth more than 2 bucks."
I'll just blame this on the cultural differences, but the employers are making money off of their backs. It seems to me that it's their job to pay the employees, not the customers'.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:00:49
None of that gives it any actual value...
@_date: 2013-08-30 19:29:51
Losing 15% each sunday doesn't look fair to me... Just take 15% on cashout or only take 15% once.

If you're lazy, sure. But then you need more more people to dig holes/graves for the auditors. And then more people to dig holes for the graves of those diggers. And then even more people. You want to secure your bitcoins, not create an infinite loop.

Since you can buy satochi's, that will never happen. 1 BTC could be out of reach for regular people, but everyone will always be able to buy a part of a bitcoin.

Wasn't this one of the more well known exploits in PHPBB2?
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:22:26
WU and Paypalare only used for actual payments while BTC transactions include people buying and selling BTC. So in the list of "services people use to buy stuff online", bitcoin is still pretty low.
Still great to see these numbers though.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:42:11
Until you sell something using Paypal and the buyer decides to screw you over...
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:58:45
Sweet. My credit just ran out and I think I can spare 0.02BTC :)
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:37:08
Thanks, I just kept assuming it was because some people missed the Bitcoin-boat and wanted to gain some money too. This actually makes sense :)
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:53:40
Do we live in a third world country? No, we do not. We actually pay our staff for the work they do. Want a 15% tip? Raise the price by 15% and give that to the servers.

How is that example helping your point?
@_date: 2013-09-08 13:54:23
I'm just a bit skeptical because I remember selling virtual (ingame) currency through Paypal. Even with a "I already received the goods" note and enough screenshots to prove beyond doubt the buyer received it, they still charged it back. I'm just doubting that they will even know what a blockchain is, let alone why that's proof of payment.
Of course, selling ingame currency wasn't exactly legal and that's probably why they did that, but you can still understand my skepticism. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:15:34
Sweet ride man! Wish I stepped in when you did.

Not if he's not in it for the money and doing it because he believes in libertarianism and BTC.

$25m worth?
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:41:59


You have to give $100 to get your name on the card, so apparently the people that give $25 won't have their name on it. So the card you get if you pay $25 is pretty much useless if you use it in an actual store.
And of course, the whole "Fees and Set Up Cost: We're sure that we'll come along some Fees and Set Up cost that we'll have to pay first" just makes it painfully obvious that they have no clue what they're doing.

 What's the use of having multiple cryptocurrencies if the first one isn't adopted yet?

Not all websites have their WHOIS info publicly visible though.

Unfortunately, knowing Paypal, it'll take a while to perfect that method...
