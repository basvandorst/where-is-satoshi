Re-read.  It's not especially difficult to migrate actively owned coins to a secure algorithm as the technology nears a tipping point; it's the abandoned coins which will slowly become available.

Fun fact - mainstream quantum computing will likely break the current encryption algorithm, and likely in our lifetimes.  Active bitcoin can easily be moved to another address under proper encryption, but "abandoned" bitcoin is far from lost.  I predict quite an industry breaking into those old addresses and recovering lost booty.

Surely a professional trader would be well aware that there are many ways to influence the price of a commodity which do not involve trading in that commodity.

Because they're not all traders.  They're looking to amass as much as possible.  
Frame it in the light of risk, if you will.  There's a very significant body of Bitcoin holders who feel that the only risk at hand is that the price will go up before they've bought in as far as they can.  
This is not unique to bitcoin.  Anyone looking to establish a long term position would buy on the way down, or as funds become available, with the expectation of future gains.

If you invest in coins now, you're exposing yourself to risk (could triple, could tank, could stay the same).  If you leave those miners on  your shelf turned off, there's no risk but they may still become useful.

I would tend to disagree, especially with a market cap as small as Bitcoin's.  It doesn't take the might of Wall Street to make a significant push up or down.  Furthermore, in this particular case, plenty of news is "real", if inconsequential in the long term due to the technical and emerging nature of the commodity in question.  
Point being, there are plenty of long term investors holding plenty of coins and seeking to drive the price down.  They're called bear whales around these parts and they're plenty real.  I wouldn't assume everyone with skin in the game wants the price to go skyward just yet.

Back to my original point - there is more than one way to manipulate a price.  Bad news, timed events, paid shills, you name it - folks don't have to buy or sell to move a price point.

You also just signed yourself up for tax liability for your realized profit, due April 2018.  At least your cost basis is higher now.

Well, 100 years at 60/day only gets you 2M, so that won't work.  You can do it in 75 years if you actually gain 4% interest tax-free, or if Bitcoin appreciates 4% per year.  Shorten that to 25 years at 25% yearly net value gained, and 6.5 years at 100% yearly net value gained.  To the moon!

Three sentences?  Ok, here we go.  Apologies in advance for the semicolon if you're a purist. 
1: "Big O" is the computer science term for algorithm scalability, meaning how much extra time it takes to solve an equation or logical sequence as more complicated work is added to the algorithm.  
2: O(n) means that the algorithm scales linearly, so if working on a list of 10 numbers takes 10 seconds then a list of 2000 numbers will take 2000 seconds; O(n^2 ) means the list of 10 may still take 10 seconds but the list of 2000 will now take 4000000 seconds (46 days).  
3: Polynomial and exponential O's mean large data sets are unusable as time scales faster than load, whereas linear and logarithmic O's allow for much more (or even infinite) growth as time scales linearly and more slowly than the load respectively.

Usually a prediction of future value is done in today's dollars.  So, a $300k predicted future value would mean a coin would trade for $427k 2027 dollars at a 3% inflation rate.

It occurs to me that adding a small amount of hashing power to each internet-connected device would hugely contribute to securing the blockchain and establishing decentralization.  
At $400 it's a novelty at best but if it's a ten cent chip at some point and everyone's phone hashes just a little while plugged in, the world is a better place.  
Like the top commenter said - it's not particularly viable now but they've got ideas.

Unless the suppressed value is being realized as the market expands, price correcting upwards for one more month and leaving no room for coins below $5,000.  Cheers, mate.
