This is clearly an ad.. É assim que achas que as coisas funcionam?
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:32:04
21 million is not entirely accurate. Round 3 million are estimated to have already been lost.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:05:30
Absolute madness!

Take the opportunity and do a worldwide trip, get someone to document everything, there is a pretty cool documentary in the making here. Hide random wallet addresses and keys and launch the hunt!
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:15:18
A 2 second search on Google would do the job.

It's essentialy the same on a larger scale.. What if your house burns down?
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:45:34
Just send it all to me and I'll take care of it ;)
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:50:34
I bet it might 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:30:56
OK, I'll try to humour you.

@_date: 2018-05-13 21:24:55
Why not check the price of bitcoin on coinmarketcap.com to see how rich you are?

I've used the Ledger Nano S for about 2 years without any problems.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:29:43
OK, but isn't that what most of us do?
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:28:06
Agreed. Pretty much verbatim of what I've been telling them.
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:46:14
That could be an optical illusion
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:07:42
20$ is not worth it.
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:59:42
A must read!
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:48:30
Trust your instincts, no one really knows.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:24:51
Will do
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:53:43
Do you know what supply and demand means?
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:02:30
If you never intend to sell, then it's completely useless.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:06:54
Not scamming. Didn't know about the exchanges. Thanks for letting me know.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:57:43
I wasn't aware of this either
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:51:30
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:18:29
I do. And have for many years now.. Unless some of your bitcoin is used at some point, it's actually a worthless piece of data on the blockchain. It's not a house that you can live in and never sell.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:54:31
Wait for the halving
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:22:58
That depends on your definition of selling. Holding forever is pointless if not traded for anything, ie. buying stuff with it or exchanging for something else.

Lost amount of bitcoin:
According to new research from Chainalysis, a digital forensics firm that studies the bitcoin blockchain, 3.79 million bitcoins are already gone for good based on a high estimate—and 2.78 million based on a low one. Those numbers imply 17% to 23% of existing bitcoins, which are today worth around $8,500 each, are lost.

He/She is or was someone very smart and forward thinking, so considering that, I'm pretty convinced that whatever holdings there are will be locked for a long, long time.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:23:50
That is just like farting and pointing at someone else.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:10:50
I'm almost certain that bitcoin uses an escalator unless the world is on fire

A pre-meme. Nice one, sir!

Just make a cavity on top of a random door in your house. It's easy and nobody is ever going to look there until the door dies.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:05:53
Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:15:02
Unless you bought at ATH, it's a pretty good place to be

Bitfinex is just as bad. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:20:20
If you do, keep it to yourself. In a few years you'll be a good target if you think you're as anonymous as you think.
@_date: 2019-09-19 14:23:05
It definitely would be, the cost and running a setup like that is a serious downside though.
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:00:30
I count 10. For reals
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:51:19
I count at least 10 coins on there.

Call it Coinbit instead ;)

I thought they were space invaders for a split sat.
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:54:06
Soon is a relative statement
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:16:03
How is it irrelevant? I've seen possible projected figures in the millions, surely that should be accounted for when the max supply is 21 million.
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:50:07
I'll take it
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:07:43
It's not doing badly in the last few weeks, I'd be very happy if the momentum keeps keeping on.
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:53:26
Yep. That makes it 13mio right now, not counting Satoshi's holdings.
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:18:24
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:48:23
Sore? I think you mean soar..
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:39:49
Definitely maybe 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:32:44
Return it. Buy directly 
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:01:30
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:15:26
Yes, but how many are considered "lost"?
Supposedly there are a heap of early day miner hard drives, lost wallets etc..
Anyone know the figures we are looking at?
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:26:52
Is that what you joined reddit to say? 
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:00:27
Just buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin, don't wait around and miss the cruise because you believe in bad influencers. I really hope you remind yourself in 6 months.
