Unless you're Peter Schiff and the crash is alway tomorrow.

Paul Krugman's prediction (Mr. I-Love-Inflation and Unlimited-Money-Printing) about the internet back in 1998: 
"The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'–which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants–becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's.... As the rate of technological change in computing slows, the number of jobs for IT specialists will decelerate, then actually turn down; ten years from now, the phrase information economy will sound silly."
This is what he predicts about bitcoins in a recent article: 
Q: "Do you think Bitcoin will gain momentum and become a viable currency?" 
A: "No. I could be wrong, but Bitcoin is harder to use than other forms of electronic payment, and lacks any fundamental source of value (unlike dollars, which can be used to pay taxes). It’s possible that Bitcoin will somehow become self-supporting, but for now my guess is that it’s largely a fad that will collapse one of these days."

It does not have intrinsic value like gold/silver. But it sure has value as a more secure currency compared to fiat currencies.

Hi Bruce. You're a great follow on FB and love how you challenge people's core beliefs. 
My questoin is you said that, "I am an outspoken critic of excessive regulation". So do you believe in some regulation of bitcoin beyond what Coinbase and Circle are doing. 
Aren't you concerned the Foundation will be yet another pay-for-benefits lobbyist group like the NRA (got no qualms with 2nd amendment, but hate the lobbying system), Wall Street (maybe not that big), etc. How would you stop the Foundation being led by sociopaths like most organizations that get big over time?

It would be nice if you could get paid to host a full node through block rewards.

Don't mistake a cyclical trend as an infinite direction.

I have a friend who has a personal residence that is worth a lot (when converted to dollars) in an African country that allows dollars to flow in but does not allow any paper assets to flow out (semi-Marxist government). There are no Bitcoin exchangers since capital controls abound and not enough people know about Bitcoin. This friend has an EU citizenship as well and would like to send the money (after liquidating the home) to his EU bank (and pay any applicable taxes). What options does he have?

Sorry for the dumb question in a crypto forum, but what does mining do for me in this situation? Thanks for your help!

Good advice, sounds like it's a tough road ahead until I get more contacts.
