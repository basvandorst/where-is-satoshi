That's why we should work to identify such sources of propaganda in all walks of life.  Cointelegraph is clearly one and should be avoided.

switching crypto is done to get rich, sure, that's the name of the trading game.  But crypto is more than trading, and it's shown on the message boards like this that there is a community.  If you look for volume and high price, you'll find hype and false image.  If you look for innovation and technology, you'll find real communities.  The free market will be free, all we can do is innovate.  The issue is that the media is so focused on the price right now that they are blinded to the innovation.  I can't tell you how many articles I've read in the last month about the price of btc being a third of what it was a year ago.
If I can make a plug for nsr, having a business backing the coin allows for the possibility of a decentralized and sustainable advertising scheme.  Maybe we should be taking out ads in the paper.

The point of this deal would be that I wouldn't need to have the assets for a year.  This isn't going to actually happen, because we would need to essentially write up a contract in person and get it notarized and stuff.  i was making a point that for most people here, or for me at least, time is money in the crypto world when seen from a large time scale.  That concept is what is being captured in this graph.

No one will do that because that's not how economics of shorting works.  If your offer were a future contract, that would be different.  I'll give you $400 in 1 year for 1 btc now, sure.
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:34:50
I'd consider it if the contract were created in such a way that I could trade it around like a futures contract (I realize this is backwards from the normal futures contracts).

That's what he's saying.  BTC without a public blockchain is fiat.  You should probably reread his comment, it's a good point that aggressive regulation is extremely difficult to avoid on the block chain and is much better addressed via political reform.

I realize this, but if i wanted a bitcoin futures contract I could buy that on an exchange.  I'm just pointing out that most people reading this probably wouldn't actually sell this low unless they think they can buy back cheaper.  If he really wants to dump all his coins at $400 and walk away, what's now vrs a year from now?  But to a trader, the advanced bitcoin is not only eventual free money when the market returns, but also an advance to play with.

Do you pay in bitcoin?

First of all, I don't remember the comment above that was deleted cause it was 4 months ago, but there was more context then than is here now.  Anyway, upon rereading the beginning of the OP, this thread is about BTC fungibility being in jeopardy from government regulation.  The statement I think I was reiterating was that the fungibility of BTC is on par with the fungibility of the US dollar, as fiat tends to have a serial number printed on it.  The difference is that with USD the government tracks the money whereas with BTC any third party can track the money.  This difference is fundamentally a side effect of allowing any third party to audit the ledger system at any time.  
The core point here is that there may be solutions to this fungiblity issue, but they are not what BTC was designed to do and will have to be done with altcoins or privacy protection projects.  The design of the bitcoin protocol, in my opinion, was to create a distributed consensus on a public ledger that can be audited by anyone at any time and is therefore bound by specific protocol rules.  I think bitcoin can still succeed in that goal whether or not collectives of people attempt to bend the protocol rules to their will.  
Bitcoin does not and cannot exist in a vacuum, otherwise what would determine its price?  Energy production, for example, is intrinsically tied with governmental forces.  What if governments start arresting miners?  Politics is everywhere and bitcoin is just a tool to be used by 51% of the collective consciousness.

This is definitely one of the more interesting points, in my opinion.  Considering how ingrained Nu is with the Peer projects, it's pretty impressive that B&amp;C is doing this for BTC and not PPC.

Distribution is a separate problem from security for POS.  PPC, for instance, uses POW for distribution.  Distribution is not a long term problem for POS as you described.  Let's assume you "horde" i.e. mint.  Now you are securing the network, good job, and your number of ppc grows.  However, your % ownership of the network does not change if it is a pure POS system, you are the inflation.  Let's say you own 50 ppc and there are only 100 ppc in existance.  After a year, you own 55 ppc and now 110 ppc are in existance.  You still own half the coins.  Once distributed, keeping it distributed is a nonissue.  Only initial distribution is of a concern, and this is why ppc is the clear front runner in the POS game: it had the best distribution (and continues to have with concepts like peershares distribution of ppc to share holders).

The value is not a direct consequence of distribution, but it is a secondary effect.  Distribution makes the coin more secure, and security brings investors.

As was said further down, bter is an alt-coin exchange.  There aren't all that many choices for coins like NODE and NSR.

They just updated the message to add "the" inbetween 'of' and 'unaffected'.  Good to know at least grammar is still being adhered to.

Or use proof of stake and have the network secure itself instead of relying on third parties to do it.

My question is can we start trading again?  When I try to trade it says i don't have a balance.  Even NXT/CNY doesn't work, and those are both recorded properly on the Funds page.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:36:34
Nu Custodians are anything but anonymous.  Nushares holders are anonymous, but the custodians must be voted in by that anonymous group of investors.  If you check out the [nubits discussion board]( you can learn more about the custodians and why they are and have been perfectly trustworthy.  [Kiara]( for example, who just recently did the PPC distribution.

He was saying the total converted worth of the account in USD and BTC at the top of the funds page is correct, so it knows our funds are there.  None of the alt coins are up yet but NXT.  My trade history is blank, what are you seeing?
