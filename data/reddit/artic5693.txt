Simple question: Can I pay for my groceries, health care, transportation or shelter in the vast majority of the US market with ANY crypto? Because if not then it has no value to the average person. Sure it's great if you buy low and sell high, like any speculative asset, but it's a currency by definition, not by use.
Also, what is the value compared to? The USD. Why? Because that's the currency you're looking to exchange cryptos for. It's blockchain-backed TF2 hats for all intents and purposes at this point.

I'm sure some guy in Idaho might take my 18 coconuts for trade for a potato but that doesn't make it a currency. Society literally has to form a consensus for a currency to be valuable, that's why we have Federal Reserve notes instead of Joe Nashville and Tom Chicago printing their own notes that they won't accept from each other.

No disrespect but I'd recommend spending some time researching economics instead of crypto and the answers to this are very evident. Fiat currency is essentially a measure of faith in a government/issuing entity whereas crypto, in it's current state, is a speculative gamble for people wishing to transfer that momentary value into their preferred fiat. 
If crypto worked as advertised it would be incredible but it's not anywhere near there yet. It's funny that people almost always tend to compare it's value vs the USD, that kind of tells you a lot of what you need to know about why the vast majority care about BTC and it's not to use it for transactions anymore than you trade AAPL stock for a new pair of shoes.
