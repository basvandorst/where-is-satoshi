When, please? At around what price? Thanks for any help.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:58:44
None, really. I asked for help more than once and got no advice. 
At this point I'm pretty much shut out of it I guess. The price is way too high.

I think, based on not much more than intuition and study of human nature, that once BTC is too hard to get into (it pretty much is already) people will still want crypto currency and so they will turn to LTC and dogecoin and such.

Can someone PM me about litecoin or other coin. No links please.

Both happy for and envious of him.
I so wanted to mine BC since the beginning but didn't know Linux. Didn't know how to learn. Didn't know a thing about it.
And I still don't. Lol

Nevermind, erasing explanation and life experience, as, explaining in response to a snide reply isn't worth it.
So it must not have been called Bitcoin...part of the memory is apparently wrong. 
Really strange feeling arguing a life experience with someone who posts a wiki link. Maybe you will experience it one day.
