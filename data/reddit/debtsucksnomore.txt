Figures things would end up this way but at least I'm not a kid any more. Everyone needs help these days and they all expect to get paid and get raises and retirement funds from the Government. Good time to plug @_date: 2013-04-07 14:06:35
More like. "That'll be $7, please. Just tap your phone on this NFC reader and pay using VISA, Mastercard, Bitcoin"

Yeah, I've bought many coins over the months from coinbase and store them on blockchain.info
There are literally 10+ different ways to buy and store your bitcoins though.

Be careful on btc-e. 24,000 guests. Something seems fishy.

There will be more millionaires that may feel like taking it all out and living off it. Right now that's around 6,000 coins. It will bring the price down $12. Couple people do that and we are down to $100.

You're right this will eventually come down. I will just sell before it bursts and count my profit.

Get your buy orders in now. The more bitcoins you have now the more millions you have later.

Let me guess. You clicked on some random link in the chatroom and now you can't access your account.

This is your last chance at taking out a $10,000 loan and buying 50 bitcoins. Price goes up to $1,000 you end up with $50,000 and take out 10 bitcoins to pay back loan. The price went $50 to $170 in 30 days. It is going to be a good Christmas.

High risk but check out litecoin. Don't tell anyone I said that on shhh. Right now it is worthless but it seems people don't care and are still buying it. You could buy low and sell high to make around 1 bitcoin. Do that a couple times.

I'm still banned from the trollbox but everything else looks OK to me. Pump that LTC and PPC baby. Chicken going to the moon.

 during the day during the week just deposit money into an account at Wells Fargo.

Anti viruses don't work in this situation. There are browser exploits that can be used and people can create new code that isn't detected by anything and then the user never knows. Someone made a post earlier mentioning there are people in the chatbox posting links to take advantage of these browser exploits to steal bitcoins and that NO ONE should click on any link in the chatbox on btce.

If it goes sour I don't know if anyone would want to buy your bitcoins for any amount of money but I guess there is a sucker born every minute so who knows.
