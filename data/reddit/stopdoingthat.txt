Prosecutions are sought for 2 reasons in the US.
1.) How much prison time a person can receive. The longer the term that's possible, the more they want to prosecute. 
Mind you, I said the amount of TIME one can receive...not the level of *harm* it causes society. I once had an FBI tell me, "We are only interested in crack cocaine cases for smaller quantities...not powdered cocaine."
Why? Because crack cocaine is punished WAY harsher than powdered cocaine. A racist policy that Obama has done *some* decent work in changing. (Wow, Obama did one thing right, at least)
This agent and his Nazi-esk minions were only concerned with how many years a person would spend in jail. Nothing more. A sad, and quite frankly evil rationale, I'm sure you'll agree.
2.) Cooperation. They want you to inform on others. Simple.
So, if they only have a unlawful money transmission charge, it doesn't whet their appetite. A first time offender charged with this will only end up pleading out to a year of prison time, or less. They can't *lean* on this person as much as they can if they throw in the drug charge.
You're seeing Bitcoin money transmission cases lumped in with drugs a lot because of these 2 factors. Plus it's easier for the prosecution to vilify mere BTC trading to a jury if the defendant is also a "drug dealer".
The system is fucked. These people truly are Nazis.

Same policy as Vermont. (I believe)
You can trade Bitcoin all day long...as long as the coins are your own. But if you start to develop what FinCEN and other regulators deem a "money services business", then you may require licensure on the state level to comply with both state and federal money transmission laws. (Under federal law, if you violate a state money transmission law, you are also guilty of violating federal law)
Selling your extra coins on LBC? Are they your own coins? No problem! Trade away.
Selling on LBC, with the intent to rebuy coins immediately and resell them again in a nature that a regulator could argue you're running a Money Services Business? You may require licensure on the state level for money transmission. (Also federal registration on the federal level..but this has been the case since 2013 FinCEN guidance... possibly even before.)

The question for me becomes, half as hard as what?
For example, the following password, I assume, is sufficient against even well funded attacks: 
Now is the attacker knows the first 39 characters of this passphrase 
but there are still another 40 characters remaining to be brute forced, I don't think it would be possible mathematically in anything short of 50 years, even with the entire Bitcoin network hashing power.
However, if the passphrase is: p4ssphraseplzthx()*&amp;^()D( 
And the attacker knows: p4ssphraseplzthx
The result would still be "half as difficult"...but the question becomes, half as difficult as what?
I suppose my question is, is knowing words 13-24, and a passphrase, in a seed equivalent to an attacker knowing:
p4ssphraseplzthx()*&amp;^()D( (in the first example)
or equivalent to the attacker knowing: p4ssphraseplzthx (in the second example)
Anyone here (of course there is, lol) capable of spelling this out mathematically?

Question is: Do you trust the Chinese?
Business ethics in China are wayyyyyyy different. It's actually considered completely acceptable to deceive people...and then bold face lie about it to save "face".

"Sell and buy back lower" is the noobie theory. In theory, it sounds great. In practice, it rarely happens. 99% of people lose money trying to time this shit.

3 years or so ago, a good friend of mine said it best...
"Wait until rappers are rapping about Bitcoin..."
I think this will be an excellent indicator that mainstream people are starting to be aware of Bitcoin...and the pile on will be huge.
Like cocaine, celebrities made it big first. The sheep will follow.

There is no mass adoption of copper as a store of value, either.

It would spook the market even when it's a mature market. 5% of the total supply is 5% regardless of whether or not the price is $10,000/coin.

Omitting anything related to the DNM activity and/or nefarious shit that is currently taking place through BTC would be a dishonest representation of the ecosystem.
I'm not saying make the whole segment about buying weed on the internet, but to consciously and deliberately ignore the roots of Bitcoin by avoiding the topic of the DNMs is like a pandering politician, lying for votes.
...and guess what? Joe Rogan listeners would LOVE this part about Bitcoin. 
You want mass adoption? Everyone smokes weed. Nudge them towards the DNMs. Why else do you think any middle class Americans, the younger Joe Rogan audience type, are gonna buy some Bitcoin?
It's the weed and libertarian ideals that'll garner curiosity from his listeners. Give them a use case. (Buy better weed  cheaper.)
Source: I started my interest in BTC in 2012 bc of the DNMs...and my interest has evolved into something much more aside from the DNMs.
Most people need a TANGIBLE BENEFIT to be interested in something at first.

"Only invest what you can afford to lose!!!"
There, I said it before the swarms of dipshits beat me to it.
People really need to stop saying this shit....unless you offer the same caveat to people that invest in stocks, bonds, whatever.
Done your homework and feel confident in parking your value in something? DO IT...don't listen to the "concerned" and "responsible" retards that keep saying this shit.
I love it...they all exclaim this same mantra in every thread like they actually give a fuck....but the posts about people being hacked or otherwise losing money get THE MOST views. 
"ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE!"
Schadenfreude under the guise of concern. Fuck off.

Winklevii will follow suit and insure their ETF as well.
At the time of the Winklevii SEC filing, there were issues with insurers having properly evaluated actuaries for a commodity like Bitcoin. Not true today.

Coinbase is very much OVER-complying. Half the shit they ask isn't really necessary with the current regulatory framework.
Does your bank ask you for the name of the recipient of the funds whenever you withdraw $100 in cash from the ATM?
"You would like to withdraw $100 from this ATM, please enter the name of the intended recipient of these funds."
^Imagine getting a message like this from the ATM. 
The travel rule under the BSA only applies for $3,000+ transfers. Coinbase will ask you these questions for $50. 
Overcomplying nonsense.

There were 11 connected peers when I logged in a werk ago.
I like the concept of Bitsquare...but these shill posts of "use bitsquare! I do!" are so transparent.

It doesn't matter WHERE Coinbase is...it matters what customers they service.
If you're in California and Coinbase is in Kentucky, Coinbase must adhere to BOTH states laws on money transmission.
I hate Coinbase, but some of you guys are really clueless about how these things work.
