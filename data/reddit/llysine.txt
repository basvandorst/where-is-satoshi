All the devs being paid by Blockstream will push ANY company promoting the Lightning Network.  That's the bottom line.  Gmaxwell and others in this little band of evil brothers are hell bent on getting the Lightning Network going and they don't care if Bitcoin is destroyed if it doesn't happen.

This was the best response to the bubbles and investor confidence I've heard.
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:34:17
Apparently many didn't including you based on your post below.
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:09:05
Honestly...fuck Bitcoin.  I hope this does happen and I am invested in Bitcoin.  The hubris of the developers, miners and all involved in the ecosystem needs a good fucking spanking.  
It's time for us all to move on to ANY other coin.

I upvoted you for providing a valid opinion. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:50:57
Truth is you're a liar and are paid by Blockstream.  Otherwise, you wouldn't hold such a strong stance.  
You should at least try to be less obvious.  
Hey, what will you do if everyone starts using XT?  LMFAO!  
Oh nooooos...it's not bitcoin because we have larger blocks....oh noooooos.

Didn't Coinbase simply say they supported BIP101?  Isn't BIP101 one of the options in the thread stickied by the mods?  Lol.  Why would they ban Coinbase for telling everyone which option of the ones the mods posted they support?
@_date: 2015-11-09 01:52:35
They have the developers AND will be first movers.  You're being willfully naive or deceptively dickish.   Whatever though, think what you like.  People are noticing though those primarily against larger blocks are the Blockstream boys and they aren't breaking ranks.  Correlation is not causation but it ain't bath water either.
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:54:52
The problem with that theory is we all know if Coinbase had been been behind the Lightning Network, we all know Theymos would have stickied the post.  An host discussion is not to be had here.

It promotes open, censor-free forums.

Now ask him his position on the Lightning Network.  This is REALLY what he's pushing.  Clearly bitcoin can't scale much longer like this and he doesn't want to do the obvious thing that will fix it.  He wants the Lightning Network changes to be implemented so Blockstream can have first mover status there.
Don't trust his stated intentions.  The guy is lying.
@_date: 2015-11-08 21:05:05
I understand you're trying to paint it that way but the fact remains, they are still around.
@_date: 2015-11-09 01:21:04
Step 2) Push the Lightning Network  
Step 3) Be the First Mover in the Lightning Network  
Step 4) Profit

Ahh...so Amir finally got tired of living in abandoned buildings and decided to take the Blockstream bribe money. 
He's probably spending his time anonymously pushing the Lightning Network now.  No need to work on anything else once you've picked your cash cow.

Obvious vote manipulation on Luke-Jr's comment.  Lol.

It looks like the libertarians were very much right when they told us competing currencies are best.

GoldCoin is the only coin with an active 51% defense system.
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:06:10
I don't know personally but I definitely wouldn't trust anyone's opinion of that on the bitcointalk website.  They're clearly biased and hell can't even be trusted with bitcoin itself at this point.
But, truth of the matter is, I don't know either.
Also, they are a very small coin so I'm certain you can check to see how they've faired so far with attacks against them.  At this point, I'd bet it's something of record and not just theorized.
@_date: 2015-11-08 21:05:35
Not according to what is already happening.  
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:53:56
Relax?  I'm just posting it where it's appropriate.  In this case it supports your thoughts but adds to them because it doesn't even take innovative ideas--just a system that works under load.
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:10:58
Just be one of the core developers, pledge allegiance to Blockstream and work to block any progress on Bitcoin.  It's the usual formula.  Not hard at all.
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:44:06
It's so obvious who is working for Blockstream.  It's also incredibly obvious they want to hinder Bitcoin development so they can be first movers and profit like crazy with Lightning.
@_date: 2015-11-09 01:31:17
Lol.  It doesn't matter if it is open source.  It requires third parties to operate and collect fees.  Who do you think that third party is going to be?   Come on man.  Ask yourself why in the hell the Blockstream investors are putting so much money into it.  Do you think they are just benevolent angels?  
@_date: 2015-11-08 18:32:56
Your opinion is the last I'd trust.  Good luck helping destroy bitcoin or getting the Lightning Network going.  I know either scenario is fine with you.
Gotta get that Blockstream cash cow going!
Edit:  Comment quickly got 4 upvotes followed by an almost instant series of downvotes.  Wonder which manipulators are doing that.  Lol.

No one's got time for fucking Lightning Network.  It's dead.  Quit pushing it.
