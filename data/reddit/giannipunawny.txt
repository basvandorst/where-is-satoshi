Who the fuck is Warren Buffet? Probably some old hack who's scared he will be replaced by the new messiah that is crypto

What the crack are you on? It's desperately wanted to drop for a couple weeks and exchange bots won't let it
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:42:17
Lol that's inevitable. Y'all should be getting out ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:38:51
Who's going to pay that?

Hubris will lead you to your end

One word to describe my past tense attachment to bitcoin AND this devastating post
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:42:07
I thought this was a joke and then I realized what sub I'm in. This is the silliest thing I've ever heard. High school level thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:14:12
Too bad you can't use the currency of the future to pay off actual things, huh?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:49
Extremely wealthy people aren't stupid enough to hoard currency when inflation takes place, so they invest in stocks and bonds and other things. In other words, they don't have a shit load of currency just waiting to toss away on wild speculation. Now you know the reason why inflation is better than deflation---*it incentivizes investment!* Welcome to economics 101!!

The 'security' of the United States goes far beyond the amount of fossil fuels they have and/or consume. Stop posting.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:17:59
Not totally illiquid, but largely. Nah I don't regret it at all. I would only be rich on paper.
Lol soon as that futures market gets going, the next crash will be absolutely spectacular.


No. The only thing behind the price is there are fewer bitcoins available than people want to buy. Supply and demand. Blockchain is open source pal, nothing special about your coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:46
Bitcoin: the project that proves it's not the system that's the problem, it's people. Cunts still get the most, and decent, hardworking people need charity.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:14:41
This is the reason major governments don't like it either, and the only guaranteed reason it will fail. Regulation is accelerating rapidly. You guys should have pushed for mass adoption first--now you're fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:24
That's a good sign? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:17:25


I thought bitcoin was money. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:42:42
You answered your own question.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:52:41
The dollar doesn't have value. It's a unit of account that notes the relative price of goods and services. The dollar has purchasing power, which decreases when inflation occurs. Interest rates are only part of the equation. 
Bitcoin isn't a currency, so whether or not it can be manipulated is irrelevant. However, a currency that cannot be manipulated by centralized democratic structures is a very very very very bad thing for an economy.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:07:20
That's a sad point of view. I agree about the Jews though lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:04:46
I considered investing at $200 but don't like illiquid markets. I'm here to warn people what's coming and maybe convince some to cash out now while they still can
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:34:18


Lol you're joking right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:09:29
The comparison is retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:04
Sweating yet?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:55:03
Because certain smart people see bitcoin is a pyramidzi scheme that could collapse at any time so they are converting into real money while they still can. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:12:12
So I have to send money to everywhere I want to buy from BEFORE I buy it? No thanks I'll stick with cash!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:39:39
What a stupid comment. 10x returns are possible by anyone, they simply involve more risk. Extremely wealthy people have more money to lose, but when they lose they lose bigger. Some take big risks, some don't.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:04:48
Inflation is an increase in the prices of goods and services
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:56:53
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:35:51
What's WAYYY more likely is most hedge funds are heavily leveraged already, shorters will massively short bitcoin, and dump actual huge amounts of coins on the exchanges for a tidy cash profit and then the price will crash like a fucking meteor and they make even more money.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:36:23
I'm sorry for your loss OP. Unfortunately this is a trend that's likely to continue in the future due to the irrational exuberance of people.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:15:57
Simply because some people bought into a technology before others? Totally absurd.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:42:38
The irony

Where's the chart for failed techs like betamax, myspace, pagers, segways, google glass, netscape, blackberry and (fittingly) Napster?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:46:08
Wait. You got burned because you bought high, so now you're gonna burn yourself even more????
You made a ton of real money for doing absolutely nothing. RUN

We have truly reached peak mania
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:16
Well ya duh I meant relatively safer. All investments have risk. The higher the risk the higher the reward...or loss. Saying rich people don't invest in 'safe-ish' investments is a downright stupid thing to say.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:56:32
That's not what inflation means
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:12:12
You think 1M is rich? Lol. That's a nice big house. 1M a year is pushing into rich.
I can't imagine I would get a boner from watching a bunch of naive late adopters lose their hard earned money to a bunch of ignorant, arrogant fucks who have NO idea what they're talking about. Some of you though yes, I genuinely wish spite upon.
All the best to you too. Get out before you can't.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:26:08
Does it though? Actually?
I'd much rather have a pound of gold than a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:06:12
Futures aren't settled in BTC though, they're settled in real money, which means that people betting on the price isn't going to affect price directly. However, it's way more likely that someone connected with futures will dump pre-owned bitcoin to cash in on a short than someone will empty their bank account to buy bitcoin to drive the price up to cash in on a long.
People are getting rid of their BTC as fast as possible right now, even with obvious tape painting going on at exchanges, because they know the price will tank next week.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:07:50


Because you know nothing about economics and your attachment to crypto-ideology prevents you from learning about it. Manipulation of money is essential for growth of wealth and regulation is essential to restrain criminals and enforce contracts. Both must come from democratic institutions. Before you claim that blockchain can enforce contracts, think for a second how someone can force you to pay on a defaulted contract when they have no access to your money.


Why is the whole world debating it then? It might be exchanged in a minimalist way, but it's not money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:13:12
Just wow. Do you know what risk is? 10x returns are *possible,* not guaranteed, for everyone, with a high amount of risk meaning you're likely to lose your investment. Saying really rich people don't invest in safe investments to make 5-10% ROI is idiotic.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:54:45
The ideologies behind it are bullshit anyway
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:03:24
Should have found that out when you first tried to register your bank account.

Can propaganda be true?
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:20:00
What amount of bitcoins could you realistically convert into US dollars in say, a weeks time?
Honest answers only please.
@_date: 2018-11-03 19:25:06
One of the greatest strengths of bitcoin is that it's yours. Your money can only go to whoever you decide it goes to. No one can hack your account or freeze your assets unless you le.......ahhhh crap.
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:54:03
Why would adoption increase when you can do the same thing with cash/credit and it won't be worth either 0.1x or 10x tomorrow?
You are involved in an asset bubble and you don't even know it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:40:07
People are less likely to use it if it's going up. What is so bloody hard about that to understand lol
