Reserving doesn't help. Other nodes don't care for how long you've had the channels open with other hubs. They only care about your connections, your fee and the amount of btc you have.

Exactly, a LN app you'd use could just open a channel to its own hub behind the scenes. The user will have no idea to what it's connected. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:28:14
Great example. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:55:27
Plus you can code it in such a way that you ignore the central hubs. Or you can just send directly to your friend/shop without routing.

No, they dont. Which is why other coins are also working on side-chain solutions (eg. Raiden for eth). 


So does bitcoin's code. But it thanks to easy to understand GUI's you dont need a coding background to use it. Well designs LN apps will solve the difficulty for you.

A wants to send 1 btc to C through B. B wants 0.001 fee. 
A sends 1.001 to B in an encrypted format. B can only unlock this sum using a key from C. The price for this key is 1 BTC.
B sends 1 Btc to C and receives the key to unlock the remainder.

Well, I can think of multiple reasons:
-They are an exchange for a product. The more popular the product is, the more it will get exchanged and the more they will earn.
-Given the huge amount of coilns they have, they can actually become a central node - the more channels they have the more fees they can charge for using these channels.

Which is possible with LN. The question of whether a coffee purchase should be on the blockchain for the next 100 years is another... I dont think it should. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:55:23
Imagine A-B-C, A wants to send 1 btc to C.
I would imagine that B requires no starting balance when opening the channels to A and C. A sends to B which immediately sends to C
A - 1
B + 1
B - 1
C + 1
If its not like this then I don't see how LN counters centralization as only the richest can create the most central nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:58:34
Which I would believe makes it so that nodes do not need funding before they can participate. A sends to B who sends to C, b receives 1 btc and sends it through immediately.

Why would you spend money on *other* things if you could spend it on bitcoin and make it worth more in a year? You have to take in account [opportunity costs ]( 1 BTC spent now on a tablet has exactly the same ROI as $600 spent now on a tablet, because you could have spent that $600 on buying 1 BTC.

I dont blame people for getting rich. I am not the hippie idealist bitcoiner which is often seen such as OP. It's just that Bitcoin isnt the fair currency that will create balance in this world. Bitcoin does not take a stance in who gets rich, and eventually (if bitcoin remains to be) the money-savvy and/or powerful people remain rich, due to their own actions (like buying 1% of all bitcoins).  
There's nothing fair (OP puts it as "Bitcoin does not take your money and give it to people who didn't earn it") in Bitcoin, it is completely neutral. I did not work hard to get my bitcoins, I did not even put many assets in. If bitcoin goes to the moon and the lower-incomes step in then I won't tell them that it's fair that I bought them 100.000 times cheaper.

That's like saying evolution has a goal. It is wrong. Bitcoin is neutral. It won't care if rich people buy most of its coins (Winklevii did, and any big banker can buy a decent % making them the richest people alive when bitoin takes off). 
Bitcoin WILL take your money and give it to people who did not earn it when it becomes a general currency. How will you pay your mortgage? How will you pay your income taxes, etc. 
The only thing that changed is that you are an early adapter and you are getting increased VALUE for doing NOTHING but hold, that's fair right? Now you get to be the hedgefund! Tell the lower- and middle class buying bitcoin in 5 years that it's fair that you got them 100.000 times cheaper and that you worked oh-so-hard for your capital.

Yep, for this to work we need people on the ground. mPesa and Western Union are pretty common in Kenya and it's not weird to take a matatu (bus) for a few hours to get to a big city and get your money. 
So as long as there are enough places to pick up your bitcoins Kenyans will be able to send each other funds without paying the 10% WU wants (I can imagine a set fee at the local pick-up office).  Right now WU can only send to other WU offices so there's little room for competition as other players will need to get the same amount of ground presence. With bitcoin anybody can become an exchange office.

You are talking about Erik Voorhees, the guy that sold Satoshi Dice for 120,000 BTC. Most likely he had connections to get his withdraw taken care of quicker (or invested in a Japanese bank account/holder) and was using this advantage to pull arbitrage from the differences in price (buy BTC on bitstamp, sell on gox, withdraw).

You can tell if a receiving address is NOT segwit: it starts with a "1"
You can tell if a receiving address MAYBE segwit: it starts with a "3".
But not all "3" addresses are segwit, that's just the code for P2SH. 
For now segwit addresses are "wrapped" in P2SH and therefore start with a "3".
In the future, a new address standard for segwit addresses may be adopted (it's in the proposal stage), in which case the address would start with "bc1" (bech32 addresses for segwit).

@_date: 2018-04-28 15:28:11
This is exactly what Ver wants, imagine the media attention BCH gets when Ver's in the courtroom repeating his 'We're Cheaper! We're Faster! WE're the real CASH!'.
Even worse, imagine that the judge allows him to continue, or that he decides that Bitcoin Cash is "the real Bitcoin" because it doesnt have segwit (after Ver's lawyers repeat over and over that Segwit has no signatures). 
BCH is losing. Do not give him more attention.

*Bigger Blocks = Movement ahead in time* will be OPs next topic. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:43:57


That there are other (unseen) factors that cause both. OP's being purposely deceptive --- although he defends it with 'do you deny that there's a 92% correlation?' The title, 'Higher blocks = Higher price' is not factual however. 
He makes it seem as if A causes B, but that's not the case. C, ..., k causes A and causes B. 
For example, useage, media, users, *time* can all be found heavily correlated. 
A *proper* OP would do autocorrelation analysis. We don't have a good OP.

We most certainly can, you might not.

I know all that, really... But still pretty much every firm has a loan running at a financial institute / bank to enable them to buy that truck for expansion, go through a bad season or to hedge risks... Banks offer valuable services.

This post is dumb. 
How to get BTC? Go to coinbase, buy them. 
How to get BTC by mining? Find appropriate miner, buy it, wait 2 months to receive it, install it, wait a long, long time for any ROI if any happens at all. If time is money, he should buy BTC.

I agree that the other exchanges also have an intrinsic premium. However the 'real' price is closest to the one with least premiums, minus that premium. Therefore other exchanges provide prices with closer proximity to the 'real' price.

Yes, again, I know how VCFs work. But some points..
1) VCFs only back a very limited _type_ of firm (young, small, high-tech, highly-innovative, high potential), and of those applying firms they only back a single-digit percentage. This means that the "normal" firm (eg. restaurants, transportation, shops, electronics, etc) will have no access to BAs and VCs. Many of these firms would not even want to because of fear of losing stakes in the firm. 99% of the firms will not see or want VC money. 
2) Any established or growing firm in that 99th percentile will be using banks in their activities. These services from banks or similar financial institutes go from the simple payment, salaries,..., to mortgages, truck leasing and hedging risk. Banks are not evil as stated by the post a few chains up. They are very much needed and their services are REAL and directly beneciifial (so its not limited to take money, pay interest). 
3) Note also that the price firms pay for VC money/influence is very high. Although I do agree that VCFs provide a very valuable service to young, high-tech firms who otherwise would not have the chance (although risk of failure is a lot higher) to expand so quickly, it should also be said that thee are many moments in a firm's life where taking the bank's money and accepting the standard rate is a much better option than losing stakes in your firm. 
The notion that was made a few chains up was in the idea of "banks will not be needed anymore when bitcoin comes". This is totally wrong. A firm will still need to make use of debt to lease trucks, people will still need to mortgage their houses, risk still needs to be hedged and normal investments also need to be made when opportunities arrive. Money is needed to create these services and so the bank will ask bitcoin users to give them the BTCs in exchange for an interest.

Buy something for $100 and another itme for $1. this currently 5000000  and 500000 Satoshis? Wait, did I say 50000000 or 5000000? Wanna count the zero's? Are we in Zimbabwe? 
Buying 500 mBTC and 5 mBTC is quicker to the eye. If the currency increases in value tenfold compared to the US (so 1BTC for 2000), then buying 50 mBTC ($100) and 0.5 mBTC ($1) still works. 
When BTC reaches total world domination we can start talking about satoshis.

This is bullshit. You do not understand the money flows, you do not understand economics. You suffer from blind hatred and live in a delusional world. 
A bank's services; mortgages, insurances, loans, etc.. are still needed. Will remain needed. Are what keeps economies alive. 
Other financial institutions get rich from stock and option trading. You think the price of Wheat is going to settle when we adopt bitcoin? No. It will still suffer from market fluctuations. You think companies being bought out and split up in more efficient parts will stop with bitcoin? No. 
etc. etc. etc.

If 'the elite' thought that bitcoin would have the possibility to become huge then they would not work against it. They would massively buy in so that their wealth increases even more when bitcoin reaches the moon. 
THats why I think the best promotion to bitcoin would be to give the politicians some with the note that if bitcoin is supported it will increase in value. No politician gonna work against his own assets.

BTC is a currency, you use it to buy things. These things could be dollars, but also Pizzas. It was the price of the BTC which fluctuated so much the last 8 hours, not the price of the pizza, or the dollar.

I still see that you are focussing on firms starting up. Start-ups are a very small part of any economy. What I am talking about, and what a bank's main group of clients is, is ongoing services to existing companies. Are peer-2-peer groups going to help me hedge risks on wheat prices? The way I see it now, P2P lending is hipsteresque, gamers supporting gamers, pie decorators supporting pie decoraters (exaggerated)... The power of VC is that they are extremely efficient in cutting the good from the bad firms, this is something traditional inveestors (banks)with years of experience are unable to copy, it is that specialized. Now, why would a group of peers be able to match the VF capabilities in analysis, networking and business development?   
Also, all these things are now available with the USD, much and much safer (not only in stability but also in moral hazard). I might be too new in the BTC area but I don't see why we cant have these things now already, with USDs. P2P investments are not bound to BTC are they? The services banks provide won't stop existing and I cant believe that individuals can match a bank's calculating power, knowledge and experience.
....TL:DR: i still don't see why the entry of BTCs would change the current workings of financial institutions. 
....and to return to my original point; I don't see why the BTC community hates banks but adores VCFs as both provide extremely valuable services to their clients.
