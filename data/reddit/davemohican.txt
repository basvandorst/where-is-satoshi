Eh then there is hope I still have some cash, I am no liar I have never been a liar, try
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:10:34


I was hoping to use this cash for my sick pay as my job does not pay sick pay I do have an account this stunt makes me feel worse then I already do, I was rushed into hospital on friday with a suspected stroke, the good news is that its Bells Palsy if you can call it good news, which means half my face is paralised and I have to use medication and tear duct drops in the hope I dont lose sight.

We wont know till they re-open, I think that any money taht was their has gone and if it did not then they will pool all our money to get themselves out of the fix.
Don't worry like me we all don't know as yet, just do not let the gloater's and told you so get to you. Hopefully karma will turn its wheel.

Genesis is expensive at the moment hashnest but only G7 is worth and low cost but you need to spend about 70 dollers which would get you about 1250 ghs and keep watch an eye on cost so you know when to pull out and keep a proffit. i.e when costs hit about 60% to 80%
Genesis you cant pull out of the contract so it will wind down over time till you get nothing which may be a bigger risk.

Very true but the problem is that you have to set buys and sells over a week which means you have to keep it in the exchange in order to maximise returns, I think a part solution would be to have is cold storage and the trad-able commodity is system token and trades are settled from cold-storage. just an idea..

It may of not been tried yet but the law of contract could be used in order for return of btc as it would still be theft or failure of said contract you might as well ask how we ever managed in the days of barter.

Amazon has never really been brave about moving before others move just take a look at how amazon branded web stores have been a failure if you where selling books, even now they are sharking book sellers by handling distribution and charging till the seller goes bust, Amazon will carry on making the Amazon mammon rich and only when they can make money themselves from bitcoin will they move to making choice for customers.

I might get the hang of this yet, hope I never have to explain this to the father in law he is still working out how to use email.
I finally found that sellers will sell smaller amounts it was not that obvious at first. Oooops suppose that's my bad.

Good article, the trade and buying public does need to have some distance, the sorts of problem happened with with the rise of mp3 which has nearly finished off all small indie record labels and is still happening now.
The artists all went chasing after the pennies and being sold a dream of getting rich the opposite happened as artists forgot the fundamentals. or put it another way the first music sites offering artists the chance to earn money while so called putting the music out to the public, all that happened was artists spent a lot of money trying to make money on sites that where only visited by the same people who where trying sell their own music on and they where not going to buy other music. 
Apple and the ilk still play this game with artists as it makes money storing all the junk people put out and sites get rich by charging to get the junk up.
If bitcoin is to succeed it must reach out to the general public to use otherwise we fall into the trap of selling only to ourselves as an investment and shops drop the coin because nobody ever buys with it.

Many years ago in Manchester England we had one of the first basic Internets which was 3 servers, one in the states and Manchester and the last one in USSR, it was called the host if I remember rightly, this was one of the great firsts, the possibilities where endless mind you it did take a time to wait for a reply sometimes an hour or more as there was no real phone modems then, thats how early this was long long before any sort of URL. 
To cut a long story short my wife and friend Steve went to St James in Manchester to to tell business people the possibilities of this device that one day people would shop and people could do shopping from a TV this would be possible, they said Nahhh it will never catch on.........

Brill as I was showing the wife how to buy a watch only go find I could not yet pay with bitcoin yet..roll it on Overstock as I really wanted that watch.

yes I am knew to the bitcoin world but so far I have only seen sites selling whole bitcoins and yes I know you can have smaller parts or Satoshis as you would get change from transactions, I stsrted to look at the Bitcoin from a traders point of view or buying CFDs and the Litecoin seems to be a better bet.
I seem to be coming to view that its a good idea if you are Sheldon from the Big Bang theory and perfect if you are on the MIT campus.
I had a look at mining the coin and I am going to get a small miner to see what happens but even on the mining forums it seems that the most you could ever do have a bit of a hobbie, I fear that this will kill the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:23:52
The last part of this report makes interesting reading as I for one was trying to work out how the claim of being lower rates maybe true while dealing in bitcoin but once you needed to get back to fiat the costs of this challenge the notion of cheaper rates.

this is still a young tech and will mature, the main base is that the more it is used for purchase the better everyone will be, with Tulip the same could be said of ebay purchases until traders get a better rep you will always get the scammers, you can go to your local shop and get card scammed just as easy, the lesson is to trade with people you trust.

At least you are thinking, most of the out of Europe crowd can hardly string a sentance together, one who rung me up did not know his history, I am still in but I do respect a good point of view, Financial services have never been a real wealth provider to the rest of the country and have been acting as pirate raiders to the HMCS and tax system, if we move out we would be back to signing the USA trade agreement which is great for the abuse of working people and those tories who make money from poor wages.

I dont think its helpful when everyone is attacking each other I have allways had an open mind and yes I was annoyed by both paycoin bans as I believe in open disscusion,
