I’ll forgive your abuse of the period, as I have no idea if you’re a native English speaker or not, but no one said anything about recessions.
The meme is cliche and, well, stupid... Also, 2008 was far more of an anomaly due to the mass use of derivative instruments, likes CDS, that were tied to MBS.

In five years the value of your home increased by 275%? Bullshit.
Edit: I’ll leave my comment unedited and accept my fate, but I’m guessing you bought before the bubble popped?

Except there are plenty of people who take out mortgages on their home and pay them off over time...

So why did you even bother replying to my comment when your response has no relevance?
A recession like the one we had in 2008 is an anomaly, and if you really want to go down that rabbit hole, let’s not forget how much shady shit goes on in the crypto world DAY IN AND DAY OUT. 
Hell, look at last December to now... By all means,  prove me wrong and tell me BTC’s catastrophic drop wasn’t due to manipulation and pure, unadulterated greed.
Edit: BTW, a mortgage is a type of a fully amortizing loan, so a borrower pays equal a set amount based on some kind of schedule, so by the the time the loan matures the last payment will have satisfied the entirety of the principal and interest.
BTW  you can make additional principal payments on top of your normal P and I payment so that you effectively pay less interest on your loan as it comes due. 
BTW  lending standards are stricter than ever before and robosigning is a thing of the past
BTW  even with The Donald and his shady ass party in office, there are still more regulations tied to the banking market than ever before 
Food for thought on how people take out a mortgage and pay it off.

I’m confident this is the dumbest statement in this entire thread
