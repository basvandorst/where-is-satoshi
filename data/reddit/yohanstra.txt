I cross posted there.

In a market like bitcoin, holding can often outperform trading bots simply because of the rapid and drastic increases in price.  However, this is only true when the value of bitcoin is increasing.  During a crash or period where the value is decreasing, our bot may lose 2% or 3% whereas holding BTC could lose 15% or 20%.
In this case, you are comparing the performance of a bot to a set of perfect trades (ie. holding BTC during price increases and selling during price decreases).  In reality, however, it is impossible to perfectly predict when to start holding your BTC or selling out.  That's why the bot must make educated guesses about what the market is going to do next.  While it may not act correctly every time, it will protect you against big decreases in value and cash in on big increases.
If I recall correctly, our bot only lost a few percent in backtesting during the drop from $1000 to $500 (where you would has lost 50% with Buy and Hold).

Ok, well that's also just plain false.
Over the last 30 days, bitcoin fell 1.1% in value (from $430 to $425) on bitstamp.
My bot, which I just backtested for the same period of time, gained 3.45% in USD.

We're not sure about the name yet, but we're planning on having a closed beta before summer starts and releasing the full product before the end of summer.

With two months, BTC lost about 20% in value while my bot still profited.

Thanks for the input!
It sounds to me like a lot of what you are asking could be done in the bot already.  I say "could" because the bot is largely customizable is not specifically designed for one specific strategy.
How important do you consider variance to a trading strategy?  I don't currently record data for price variance but I certainly could.
Your backtesting example confuses me -   how is it possible to profit while subtracting all of the gains from a period of time?

That's the goal!

Yes, but in that time frame bitcoin only rose in value.  Therefore, holding BTC during that time period is the same as making perfect trades.  
The main point I was trying to make is that holding only works when bitcoin rises in value. During crashes (or any decrease in bitcoin's value) our bot outperforms buy and hold by a very significant margin.

Got it, thanks again!

I hadn't thought of that before, thanks!  I'll get to work immediately on adding profit as a feature....
In all seriousness though, our bot performs very well in backtesting (5%-20% per month) and we have made a decent profit while testing our bot in recent weeks.
