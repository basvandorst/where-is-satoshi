I never tumbled my coins before but I only ever bought legal chemicals from freelance vendors.  Still it was always said to be an imperative step in the transaction and I never understood why so I never did it; although to be fair in my case I wasn't breaking any laws that I'm aware of.  I never had any issues.

There are diminishing returns on speed of air travel.  u/frizzyhaired is right, efficiency/affordability and longterm sustainability are much more important aspects to improve upon.  Currently it burns so many tons of fuel, worth so many millions of dollars, not to mention the environmental impacts and the lack of long-term sustainability once we hit a fossil-fuel shortage.  
  
  
  Being able to continue flying passengers around the world at rates they can afford to pay, for the foreseeable future, and without burning up all the fuel, is much more important than being able to get from New York to London in three hours instead of eight hours.

I think it's stabilized at 10-12k and the sharp peaks and valleys are done for, finally, at least for awhile.  maybe some deflation will occur, maybe some inflation but less of this spikes and dips.  It would be great if it seriously levels out and we see widespread adoption, so people can start using it as currency finally and not as a roulette wheel.  
  
  Use it to pay for things that people want to sell, including labor and housing someday, without dealing with existing financial institutions.  Create loans, capital investments, mortgage firms, with a decentralized currency.  the best thing for btc would be if the price literally flatlined.

all we need is a product that's totally legal and in high demand, but that people are still dreadfully ashamed of buying.
