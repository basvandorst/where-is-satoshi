I think OP is trying to say that the exposure Dogecoin got on national television was more then worth the initial investment.
Edit: I initially said 'how much money you make' on the definition of ROI, but that's not accurate, it doesn't have to be monetary gains. Maybe that's where we are disagreeing.

Poor him.

In business/financial context, it means 'Return On Investment', basically how much value you get back on the initial investment you make.

Platform name?

Has anyone tried this?

Health, sometimes, cannot be bought by money. I feel good knowing I have good health even though I'm not a billionaire.

So other than people who just want to make money, why would anyone buy Primecoin?
The implementation is basically the same right?

You know, or just this:

To be honest, if you can't figure that out for your self, Bitcoin might not be for you. 
The previous sentence is snarky but I said it anyways because people who can't figure stuff out on their own are the ones who often get scammed or worse, just lose Bitcoins randomly. I'd rather not see people lose money for no good reason.

That was a lot of words you could have used to explain to OP how he can get Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-11 15:26:01
Jeez you sound like an ass. The point is to spread the word to casual users, not make a perfectly secure physical Bitcoins card. We aren't telling them to put their life savings into paper wallet.
Can you not understand the concept that most people don't know and don't care enough to do what you do? Your parents probably don't understand the cryptography behind Bitcoins but we still want them to use it. This is a decent way to get people who don't know about Bitcoin to notice the currency.

After realizing that OP isn't really reading any of the wiki that's available, it occurred to me that some people need to wait until Bitcoins are mature enough where they are being sold at a local store (like OP suggested). 
I get where you are coming from in criticising my response, but I also really believe it's not for everyone right now.

Oh San Jose, you so silly.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:35:38
... I want someone to actually use Bitcoins and come back with the story.

 - Option 1: Buy it in person:  comes to mind
 - Option 2: Trade manually online:  This requires some knowledge of how to navigate irc but I've done it before.
All in all, you don't have that much option.
