I want to begin looking at smaller cyptos, what is a good exchange to begin with?

Can someone explain: I'm on GDAX, it looks like a lot of people are selling more so than buying, why doesn't this cause a dip?

Hi, I am new to the game and just ordered a Ledger Nano hardware wallet, and I am wondering if this was necessary. I only have ~$300 of coin, but I am looking to purchase a significant amount more. My question is, was it a dumb idea to buy the hardware wallet? Can i transfer to the wallet multiple times as time goes on and I order more?

I am too! I keep thinking I'm waiting for the right time but that's never coming lol. Might as well say fuck it and do it.

Google is your friend :) and these subs (r/bitcoin, r/coinbase, etc.) have frequent answers to most questions, do a lil bit of digging

I bought some at 19,300 the other day and now it's looking like a mistake. lol

I too want to YOLO at this and hop on one before it gets too high for me to buy in.
So torn!

Exactly, thank you! Not panicking, just hindsight bias that my money could have stretched a little farther if I waited a bit :) c'est la vie! Riding this wave to the moon regardless

Bought in at $98 -- so glad I've held! I'm a n00b to the game so this is satisfying for a beginner!

I threw in 300 when it was at 16,9... should have waited til lunch was over lol
