You are avoiding my question. Why didn’t you sell when it was 20K... Idgaf when you bought it, I’m just wondering why you feel proud by now owning something that was worth double of what it is today.

Gold has been valued alot because it was adopted as the main currency back in the early days of human civilization. You can argue that its worthless all you want but this market has been backed by its rarity and human civilization for thousands of years since you and I are both human, we can't escape tradition/customs in our daily life. Also Iridium is very hard to extract and process (impossible for early humans to use) and gold's got more uses such as space discovery, conducting electricty and of course jewelery. Most women and lot's of men in this world own gold so its value is almost impossible to wipe out completely. Whereas bitcoin could not be here at all and make only a tiny fraction of a difference compared to having gold disappear all of a sudden.

r/bitcoin is pretty much a microcosm for all bitcoin HODLers out there tho
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:22:08
Doesn’t make sense why you think you’re being smart by only doubling your money when you could’ve quadrupled. Not sure why you would take pride in that..
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:57:31
For every person like me who are skeptical about the crash there are delusional people like you who prefer to attack all those to disagree with bitcoin price raise. My friend went to the hospital after cutting himself due to bitcoin losses. Furthermore a truly wise investor would sell on the rises and buy on the dips. Not just speculate only the future... 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:37:24
Tony Robbins is correct in saying that, but would the market ever be the same if no one sold their stocks. It’s impossible for a stock market to function if absolutely 0 transactions happen lmao.

I don’t know why you use sarcasm or think you’re being funny by your facetious statements. Some people need to sell to pay back loans from family, tuition, credit card bills, food, mortgage and are already stressed due to the crash. You mocking them on the internet shows how self-centered you are as a human being. Even if bitcoin makes a recovery, it can’t save your poor personality which matter mores than money. We get it, you’re optimistic which is great.. but you don’t need to be a jerk while showing your enthusiasm.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:25:11
Your arguement is based on the belief that everyone invested when it was 2017 and prices are low. Hence your arguement is not really valid. A lot of people invested when it was above 15K hence a 5K price raise to 20K... 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:49:53
Did you consider the uses of gold in the tech sector compared to iridium?
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:38:27
Gold wouldn't hold its value to today if it was not rare at all and found laying under your feet. Let's admit to that. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:37:51
It does, to some extent. Maybe not the current value, but people used gold as the standard of currency due to its rarity and not dirt for example due to its abundance...
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:28:29
Rarity... a material doesn’t need to be backed by anything... I swear the average general IQ of bitcoins holders are higher than the general population but when it comes to social studies and economics they are at a teenage level.

1. He's not my friend. 
2. Your attempt at humor is trash, you must be a treat at parties. 
3. Bitcoin investors like you are all kinds of stupid I can't expect any more of you than making these stupid statements on the reddit. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:35:44
I've been lurking in this subreddit now and I can have considerable portfolio in BTC which tanked today, I'm probably gonna do get downvoted for this but here's my 2 cents.
Firstly, I see 4 kinds of people in this subreddit when the price goes down. The "I bought at 50 dollar a coin" guy, the "Oh yea, I mined back in '15 in my basement" guy, the "stop spreading FUD, I'm down 50% but I'm ok with it" guy, and my personal favorite "Oh yea that's what they said at 1K" guy. Most of these guys are full of shit, either they're lying or they're delusional. You guys are literally all excuses when it comes to losses. For the select few who are OGs, respect but you still fucked up.
I'm not ok with BTC dropping. Sure, I bought at 2K but I'm not fucking ok with it dipping 50% and I'm deadass tired of salty people playing it off, just face it, you lost money you could've earned when it was ATH, stop acting immature and realized you fked up to some degree. Secondly, I'm convinced the only thing that significantly changes BTC price is public speculation and image. Literally no one cares about the shit you guys find on the internet about some altcoin ICO changing BTC prices or some "whales" manipulating prices and other ridiculous bullshit. I really hope everyone on this subreddit is an adult and can grow a pair and realize you fked up, decide if you're cashing out or not. If not, STFU and hold,  but stop looking for the BS conspiracy theory that's changing BTC prices, literally none of that shit matters. I can't believe the amount of people who lost their judgement due to saltiness, where are my real people at? If you're emotionally attached to bitcoin I don't judge but you should seriously consider stopping investing this ain't for you. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:13:07


This needs to stop, people need to realize money doesn't drop from the sky like investing in BTC will somehow net you a million bucks. Sorry mate the real world doesn't come this easy, if you're living in that world tell me how I can get there.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:03:22
First of all, I said investing is probably not for you, not bitcoin. And if you fail to see why being delusional and irrational will lead to bad investment decisions then I can't help you.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:49:36
Sorry I searched it up and the first thing that came up was "Glove and Boots", South park and then the Simpsons who uses 'meh' who do you want me to think? Great shows by the way, save the first one, whatever that is; but preteen probably, might wanna change up your own vocab before making fun of others? "40 year old"
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:55:02
You make everything about yourself, so stop doing it. Not everyone wants to educate themselves about how to make money with BTC, majority of people just bought and hold and lost money right now. And if you think everything who bought BTC at a higher price can make profit off their BTC losing value then I think you have a lot of learning to do as well, especially in the common sense department.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:27:24
Its at sub 4K dude, its not looking good. Stop comparing it to 2010 prices, you didn't buy any at 2010 so stop talking about it. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:35:34
I want people to just realize they're in the hole like you said. Acknowledge that you were the reason you're in the hole no matter how big that hole may be. And stop acting like Bitcoin is totally performing fine right now when it dropped a huge amount in value. If you think it's doing fine right now, then I think you're delusional, but if you are in terms of believing its in a shit spot right now but could improve in this future then thats a totally ok attitude. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:15:29
Yea you want some fiat for your birthday? I think bitcoin is too volatile for your heart

\&gt; cryptoasset
Problem is majority of the people in this world don't care about crypto assets.
\&gt;fixed supply
So is gold, and dirt? Does it matter?
\&gt; I find it very unlikely that any other crypto asset can substitute bitcoin
True, but its very unlikely any asset can substitute the dollar.
\&gt; Govt issued crypto
Not happening
\&gt; cost and speed issue
Except the rest of us do care about these issues
\&gt; most secure and trustless feature
Trustless? You mean trustful? I trust my bank way more than any crypto exchange, remember mount gox? If you lose your bitcoins, good luck getting them back, if you fall to credit card fraud/bank fraud, there's a good chance you can take legal action and get your money back.
Millions of BTC articles out there on both sides of the coin, doesn't bring any merit to your arguments
You've failed in all the points you made to undermine any aspect of FIAT money, there are pros of bitcoin over fiat, you just failed to mention any of them at all. (E.g privacy, decentralization), so I feel like you're the one who truly doesn't know a whole lot about bitcoin, so stop trying to act like you know :P
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:52:10
meh, so are you
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:07:23
I said "investing" not bitcoin, if you're replying to the subreddit then you need to work on your basic reddit skills, but last time I checked you replied to my comment so take it for face value. You look even worse using sarcasm 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:02:52


Sure, in hindsight its easy to say, but did we all think it was realistic it was gonna keep mooning? You made a decision not to sell, no one else. And now you live with the consequences, however severe that may be; for some 1%, for others they could be on overdue rent. Its not immature to say you didn't fuck up, making excuses and acting salty for it is. Investing in bitcoin is almost like gambling, did you know it was going up or down? What information did you base it on? Whatever that may be its probably wrong because you would've sold it back then if you had correct info. Therefore, choosing to invest in bitcoin is like gambling, you bet a good amount and you lost the bet: "Oh yea its not immature to say I fucked up because I could've totally mooned with my bet"
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:34:56
Glad you admitted your wallet cannot, thats the first time in becoming mature which is what this post was about. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:28:40
When did I say you had to sell? Before moving on to wisdom let’s talk about reading skills for you buddy you’re getting ahead of yourself here. Furthermore this is a post about people making excuses for their losses and how they can’t accept the fact that BTC is performing poorly. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:36:43
No you seem like you're in the retard park and still haven't figured out how to leave that park for about an hour now. You're trying too hard but you're digging yourself a deeper hole. Some years from now you'll look back on reddit to realize how dumb and self-centered you were back then and you'll thank me for making a putting some sense into you. At the moment you have too much ego clouding your judgment. Ciao :D 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:33:24


If you sold it at the price, then you should be happy. What interested me and probably the majority of people on this subreddit for BTC? Money. No its not a hobby for many of us, good for you if it is. But many of us are losing money and I'm sick and tired of people being delusional and not facing their losses like a mature adult. If you're in terms of what you said about losing money is part of the game then sure. I'm not ok with people blaming everything and everyone and still not acknowledging that they left money on the table. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:25:20

Sorry I don't think you understand what this subreddit is for, please read some posts and get back to me when you understand that most people on this subreddit bought bitcoin and are watching their money vanish right now because the market is doing poorly. Stop making everything about yourself. Just like when the stock market crashes you can ask "why didn't these people just lend their stocks and make money?" You're making yourself look pretty dumb right now.

"So you want people to behave exactly how you want them to?"
Not sure if you read my post, but I don't understand where you got that from. I said people are delusional, never said you had to act a certain way. If you laugh about it then ok, probably not good for you financially but what do I care?

Yea I'm pissed I lost money, but I can't stand people who can't take losses like an adult. Grow a backbone.

Sure, he was being argumentative and albeit a bit stupid. But saying " you're like the kind of person i hope gets jacked, robbed and beat. " and then claim you're not angry and that hostile speech is not welcome? No normal person would say that unless the other dude did something seriously fucked up. I feel like you have a lot of pent up anger/violence and should get that taken care of. GL dude

The debate here is about gold, not FIAT you're changing the topic. Yea and gold's value does come from being a material, whatever your argument with 90 percent of gold's value doesn't come from utility is your own statistic, I never agreed with you there.


Fix grammar, 0 idea what you're trying to say.
Still haven't named where bitcoin gets its value, oh wait I just remebered, from delusional hodlers like you. 
I refuse to argue with you further because so far your counter-arguments is just ignoring my points. Gonna enjoy the superbowl now, BOL. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:12:05
I'm fine with your attitude, if you're in terms with your losses. I'm all but respect for you. I'm addressing people who are making excuses for their losses and acting like they didn't just lose money. The fine line between an investor and a fool is that investors counts their losses and see how to improve from their mistakes, fools blame everything, everyone but themselves to realize they lost money from their own poor judgement and can't accept the fact that they fked up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:17:41
Again, you're purposely ignoring parts of my counter-arguments because you can't properly address them and you still refuse to provide source-back statistics after I called you out in the previous post. I'm sorry for responding after I swore that I wouldn't but what you just said was just too annoying not to respond to. Now I promise I won't because you did exactly what I just said you've been doing. BOL with bitcoin
P.S: I own and support bitcoin guys, but can't stand this guy being unreasonable and delusional as a result of his investments.

Yep, because we can build computers, propose to that special someone in life and manufacture space shuttles with bitcoins right? I don't get how people think something natural and man-made are the same thing. Some of you bitcoin holders are getting to the realm of being ridiculous now.

I love you so much I am giving you a ring out of stuff I could have built a computer with instead. Oh how special she will feel.
Not sure who married you, best of luck to her. 


You admit it's a material, explain even one thing bitcoin is used to manufacture?  Yep, didn't think so 100% of Bitcoin's value has nothing to do with its utility as a material. 
Right, I'm someone who believes gold has value yet don't know anything about economics. Good job calling out everyone who thinks gold has value. (AKA &gt;90 percent of society). You must be the smartest man on earth.

Sunk Lost Fallacy - The tendency of people to irrationally follow through on an activity that is not meeting their expectations because of the time and/or money they have already spent on it. The sunk cost trap explains why people finish movies they aren’t enjoying, finish meals that taste bad, hold on to investments that are underperforming
Got this from investopedia, pretty sure you found a source purposefully to alter the meaning of the whole thing or purposefully left out certain parts.  Nice try though ;)
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:40:15
or maybe he's just buying something more expensive than the money he has and was hoping that bitcoin would go to the moon so he could buy it. Maybe a lambo ;)
