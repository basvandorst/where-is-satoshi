There's big difference between "my dollars" and "dollars". Euro didn't hyperinflate or anything. Yet if you were a Greek in Greece, for several weeks you could only get €60 in cash from the bank, all transfers outside the country were banned and traveling outside with cash over some amount was made illegal. That happened in a supposedly first-world country.  
The next most likely candidate for this is Italy... which could collapse the entire eurozone.  
Indian rupees weren't devalued either, the state just banned some banknotes and made them worthless for wide swathes of the population. Savings from years of not reported work for $1/hr? Gone. Savings owned by the illiterate 26% of the population? Gone, as they are incapable of using a bank account, and reporting the source of their income I guess. Savings owned by everyone who didn't trust banks in a corrupt third-world country? Gone too.  
Edit: according to [this]( everyone can only convert ~$60... Wow. 
I wouldn't be too surprised to hear China pull some similar shit. Would you?
Now for US dollars in America these risks are indeed not that great, and general hyperinflation risk is minuscule.

USD bankwire, EUR SEPA is free. So you should do ILS-&gt;EUR SEPA account. Not sure if they exist in Israel

Ok it seems if you have an original cable you may try this

Bitfinex needs separate accounts because without them CFTC doesn't allow margin trading for Americans. 
Without cftc action presumably they wouldn't need BitGo shitty solution and they wouldn't get hacked

You need to start the phone in a recovery mode, then connect using adb to a pc and copy files using pull command. 
Google specific instructions for your model

So sad, he deserves to have streets named after him, not rot in prison. I hope he gets out - alive - eventually.

The state has the ability to confiscate your bank account, or make your physical money suddenly worthless. Capital controls can be suddenly introduced. Same applies to virtual claims on gold. You can hide physical, but then to get something for it you have to sell it for physical money somehow, which has high fees, can be dangerous and is easily made illegal. Trying to escape the country with gold in your backpack can end very badly. 
I guess if you are Swiss living in Switzerland these concerns are very unlikely and you can trust your institutions. Not for any other country though. Either they are too weak in case SHTF or dangerous themselves. 
If you think you can trust US govt and institutions 'civil forfeiture' is enough counterexample.  
Nearly everyone on Earth plays a perverse lottery - there's some chance, higher or lower depending on how corrupt and starved for money your country is, that some day you wake up to find your life destroyed by the state, everything frozen or confiscated. No money left to fight back. 
Smart wealthy people have enough resources to protect against it with complicated and/or international legal structures, or just wealthy/powerful friends or family.

Israel?  
Your main problem is exchanging ILS to other currencies, look at online currency exchangers, they should have near-forex rates.  
Exchange verification itself is not a problem, there are some exchanges that don't require it up to the legal EU limit of €15k annually, most want just standard passport scan + utility bill. Kraken is one of the most strict. 
If your local market is so uncompetitive you should try arbitrage, or perhaps even start a local exchange. If you don't have American citizenship getting a bank account in EU is relatively easy, as long as you are willing to fly once.

It seems you lost the bitcoins, sorry. 
You may try asking on xda but I don't think there's any other trick left.

Why not use one of existing cam sites? The intersection of 'pays for porn' and 'uses bitcoin' is most likely very small...

What about all people who actually use bitcoin? Drug dealers, rc sellers, people playing illegal betting sites (online poker). Also small scale tax evading I guess.
