It’s fine when they’re not deceptive about it. It’s not fine when they’re deceptive about it. 
Deception includes burying things in fine print that the average person doesn’t read and making it so complicated that they wouldn’t understand it if they did.
I’m worked up over the attitude that if we repeat an excuse for bad behavior enough times, it makes it okay. Why are we so eager to gang up on each other in defense of big companies?

Let's pretend we're talking about physical dollar bills with serial numbers being sent to physical addresses. And let's say you have 2 houses where you send and receive money. Someone is stalking you and trying to figure out which houses are yours. Every time you send or receive money, they go into your mailbox and open the envelope, make a note of the serial numbers on the dollar bills, and then close up the envelope and send it on its way.
They know that 1 of the houses is yours. They're trying to figure out if the other house is also yours. So they send $1 in an envelope to House  You open that envelope and you're not sure who the $1 is from, but cool, a free dollar, right? You can use that for something. You stick it in your wallet without thinking about it.
Then you make a purchase and send $500 from House  And since you have it in your wallet, you use the $1 bill they sent you. When they open the envelope and find the dollar they sent to House  in a payment coming from House  they know that House  and House  have the same owner.

Can I ask a question?
Why encourage people to HODL? It seems to me that there are two basic principles that justify BTC's current price. The first is speculation about its future value. These are the value investors who buy BTC like it's an equity or commodity with the belief that it is currently below some future value, and they do so with the intent to sell it at some point, probably for fiat.
The other is BTC's usefulness as a currency. And it seems like this is where its long-term value truly lies (which is what you should be interested in if your plan is to HODL indefinitely).
I understand why you wouldn't want people to exchange BTC for dollars or other currencies. But why don't you want them to spend it? It seems to me like this focus on HODL basically guarantees that you turn BTC into a speculative game of musical chairs where there will be a bubble, and where that volatility (in both directions) will scare away people looking to use it as a currency rather than an investment vehicle.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:47
The people saying to HODL it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:47


Also does not seem reasonable at all
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:46:47
But how is exchanging it for dollars different than exchanging it for a TV? Especially if the vendor of the TV is just exchanging their BTCs for dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:59:45
Great. So, HODL or SPEDN, then?

I hate to break it to you, but this one's a trap too. If your attitude is "If I ever relapse, I'll never quit again" and then you do relapse, guess what's going to happen.
After &gt;10 years quit with multiple relapses, trust me when I say that the best attitude you can have is something along the lines of "I don't want to smoke. If I start again, I will quit again because I don't want to smoke, but it will be extremely painful and difficult, so I'm going to try my best each day not to relapse."
If you're one of the lucky, tiny minority who never relapses, then congratulations. But don't count on it.
I don't mean to sound too negative. Two months is a hell of an accomplishment and you should be proud. Two years will be even greater, and twenty years is an amazing milestone to look forward to. But you're fighting a powerful addiction that will challenge you for the rest of your life. Do your best to be prepared for that.
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:05:10
That's great. Seems like you're doing really well. 
My use of the word "lucky" in my original comment was wrong. No luck involved here, just raw will power. 
Keep it up!

You know what would make that even easier? Some kind of service that sits in the middle and brokers the deal. That way I can see lots of offers from sellers (including ones whose pricing I do like), and you can see lots of offers from buyers. And then when I'm ready to buy, I can transfer my money directly from my bank account to an entity I trust instead of mailing cash in an envelope to a stranger with poor customer service skills whom I met on reddit.
The only thing I'm not sure about is what word to use to describe this service. I guess I'll think about it some more while I wait for the only US exchange to come back online.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:17:36
Please send me bitcoin. I have no way of sending you bitcoin because I do not have any. And I have no way of sending you other currency because the only US exchange is down. Hope that's okay.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:52:34
First, I did not say that. Second, for the majority of people to be willing and able to exchange fiat currency for Bitcoin, easy access to an exchange is needed. They aren't lining up to do back-alley cash deals with people like you.

Yes, but the people who hold paper gold (gold-backed ETFs) are forgoing many of the supposed benefits of owning gold, primarily that it would hold its value in the event of a collapse of the financial system.
I'm not arguing that the existence of this ETF prevents people from buying Bitcoin, or even that the relationship between the price of this ETF and the price of Bitcoins is artificial; I'm just saying that, in the example situations many people cite as the primary motivating factors for owning Bitcoin, "paper Bitcoin" is absolutely worthless.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:22:19
Look, this whole thread started with comment about bitcoin not "working" without an exchange.
If your definition of bitcoin "working" is a bunch of Chinese miners and fedora-wearing libertarians sending BTC back and forth to each other for fun, then you're right: no exchange is necessary. You can send your coins to whomever you want, and they can send them back to you. New players can't enter the market because there's nowhere to buy coins, and most people and businesses won't want your coins because they have no way to convert them to other useful currencies.
If your definition of "working" involves bitcoin being traded among other global currencies and being used for mainstream, commercial payments for goods and services, investing, settling funds between financial institutions, etc., then large, reliable, user-friendly exchanges are completely necessary.
If you think I'm wrong, then explain how it's gonna work otherwise.

I was being sarcastic. It's the first question I get asked by skeptical know-it-alls when I try to explain Bitcoin.
One person, who had never heard of Bitcoin before, let me get about 15 seconds into my explanation before he began insisting that the entire Bitcoin market was being controlled and manipulated by a handful of undergraduate students at MIT.
@_date: 2013-07-02 04:07:36
That's the point; I don't believe they can be redeemed for Bitcoin. They can only be sold for fiat on an exchange, which means that if the fiat system and/or exchange have collapsed, you are SOL.
@_date: 2013-07-02 02:25:48
In what way does this NOT defeat the entire purpose of Bitcoin, i.e. protection from financial markets and government interference with the exchanges? It's kind of like "paper gold", but even more useless.
@_date: 2013-03-03 04:35:03
Yeah, but who controls it?
