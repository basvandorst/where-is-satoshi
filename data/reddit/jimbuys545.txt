Lots of better alternatives to both TCP and IP. Lots of better alternatives than Http.
Didn't matter then. And doesn't matter now.

No no no, this isn't sms 2FA. This is having recovery of your 2FA device available via SMS.
Go to your exchanges and Google authenticators and print out back up codes. Then TURN OFF your sms recovery option. Do it right now!

This is true. We chose hard money over privacy. Now we must live with it

A nation state attack would never be a technical attack. Rather it would involve disinformation, social engineering and reputation attacks that would make the block size war seem minor. Throw in developer identity theft (maybe the occasional dev assassination) and all is lost before we realize it.
The inability for Bitcoin to implement real privacy and the hard enforcement of no privacy on second layers, is the nation state's only agenda. Go ahead and run big brother Bitcoin where we can see everything you do with your money, just as long as coinjoin outputs are blacklisted by the onramps.
Today's transparent Bitcoin is a nation state's dream, and we've handed it to them on a platter. 
We need layer 1 privacy, or you're wise to short bitcoin and long big brother.

Can someone shop GMax in the background scolding Elmo?

Agree that it's likely, if private from the get go, it would have been rendered anemic (tiny, irrelevant though alive) back in 2011/12. A real catch-22. 
So we prob took the best road we could: make a hard money golden goose that the wealthy couldn't resist. Now that the powerful are addicted, it's impossible to stop, as Andreas said, as the powerful will fight the powerful to a stalemate. 
Now that hardest of tricks: sliding in privacy. The powerful are not as incentivised in this regard, as they have other means to keep their secrets. Fungibility is the Achilles heel and may get decided in the courts the same as fiat fungibility did (you use to be able to refuse a dollar bill as payment based on the serial code). Such irony in the end.

I think the markets will stick w the nation state's chain. Wall Street ain't going to risk jail for your "real" Bitcoin. Both chains will continue to have value, similar to existing forks. 
Devs will leave the nation state fork, sure, but since it's mostly ossified by then, will their departure matter?

They don't need control over it. They just need to be able to identify you.
