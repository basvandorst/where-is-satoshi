Gotta be honest, reading your profile I don't think you're genuinely asking the question here. Seems like you've already made up your mind and feel like trying to convince us thick headed bitcoiners that we're wasting our time.
If you really want to ask these questions put in the work first. Read about hashing functions, merkle trees and private key signatures. Learn how you are already dependent on these technologies today. Learn how they are poorly implemented by the financial systems that you do trust. And come to understand that there is a need for bitcoin simply because e-commerce is fundamentally broken. 
I grant that most of us (including myself) don't have a firm grasp of economic principles. I'm assuming given how you're coming at this discussion that you have some formal education in that field. But to you I say, you don't have firm grasp of the technologies you're dependent on and bitcoin (and possibly some other cryptos like Monero) are the only truly secure digital transactions.
In short, a lot of us know we're flying a bit blind on the economic side but it doesn't bother us. Why should it? You're flying blind on the technological side of things every day and it doesn't bother you.

Yes! Go on Google and look up a SHA256 calculator. Try a few random inputs and see how drastically the results change even with a minor change in input.
Once you've done that play a game with yourself and see how many tries it takes you to find an input that has a result starting with the letter A.
Congratulations! You're mining! Aside from the way inputs are selected and the difficulty of the target this is exactly what mining rigs are doing.
Let me know if you'd like me to expand on some aspect of this explanation :)
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:30:51
SHA256 works fine today but hashing algorithms weaken over time. We saw this happen with MD5. I don't know what the timeline is for SHA256 but at some point that will have to be changed.
Once it's time to change how does the network decide what algorithm to use and when to start using it?

Monero is the only other crypto I follow. Litecoin and ethereum seem fine but I'm not that interested.
I did take the time to read the "white papers" of a number of coins that came out during the last run up. Most of them used technical terms in a very loose manner and ultimately had zero substance. I got pretty pissed at all the (probably inadvertent) shills for some crypto that claimed it didn't need PoW. Then right in the white paper it says it uses PoW for spam protection and would change it later. No mention of how.
These days I try to tell people the innovation that Bitcoin brought to the table wasn't blockchain. It's decentralized authority. Right away that means Ripple and Libra are doing something else entirely and have nothing to do with the innovations brought about by Bitcoin. I haven't seen any alternative implementations to distributed authority that don't rely on PoW.
There's a *lot* of interesting ways the Bitcoin ledger can be used. The project I'm most interested in is namecoin which can be used as a decentralized authority alternative to DNS. See: 
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:39:24


Nope! In order to keep the network secure the cost to maintain the average hash rate of the network needs to remain above whatever amount someone would be willing to pay to try to kill the network.

Yep. We also said it from $1,200 all the way down to $200.
Look if you're coming here hoping we can predict the future and can promise a return you should sell your Bitcoin and get out now. None of us has any solid proof of what's going to happen to the price.
The reason a lot of us have ceaseless optimism regardless of the movement is:  
1. The technology is solid.  
2. We haven't invested more than we can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:32:46
Yes whoever solves the next block (a block with a hash value lower than the target) can broadcast that block and redeem their reward once it has enough network confirmations.
The benefit of this processing is that in order to wreak havoc on the network by producing double spends you'd need to spend a lot of money getting the necessary hardware. Once you have all that hardware and execute your exploit successfully and kill Bitcoin you now have a bunch of useless hardware.
Mining is using greed to turn would be malicious actors into constructive participants.

I haven't been keeping up with bcash so my information is probably outdated. I believe small blocks are better for the long term security of the network but I can't prove that. I can say if bcash is still minable by Bitcoin hardware their network is at risk given how much lower their average hash rate is.

We're digging into the economics side so don't ask me to back up my speculations here. ��


I disagree. I can think of lots of things that retain their worth even if they aren't used or spent. Cars for example.


So far the proper incentives have been maintained by the price alone. Personally I don't see why that wouldn't continue to work for another 10~ halvenings.


Not really. In my mind each day that passes where Bitcoin can be used to send large sums of money securely across the internet is historic. This space isn't going to move as fast as the internet does. There's too much at stake to move fast and break things.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:27:48
I'm really tempted to say "it depends" here. :)
What the general public and even a lot of software engineers have come to understand as "digital security" is a bit of a farce. Digital security, true digital security is immensely difficult if not impossible. Stallman is one of the few technological faces who truly understood this or at the very least wasn't afraid to come out and say it.
But both those answers are cop outs if you're asking what's feasible. So here's the answer to that:
1. What is feasible is learning about cryptography and produce a private and public key pair. The less you rely on digital hardware the more secure you'll be. You can produce a key using non digital methods and you can even calculate a public key by hand. Of course you'd want to double, triple and quadruple check your calculations.
2. While the above is feasible it's likely overkill. Unless you have real reason to believe the ABCs are targeting you specifically and monitoring every digital signal coming out of your dwelling you can make some concessions. Producing a private key using dice is still pretty easy so do that. Then use an air gapped machine to calculate the public key. Personally I like raspberry pis because I can destroy the SD card when I'm done.
3. I like the solution above because it's something I already know how to do. But it would take months or years for most people to get to that point. While a hardware wallet does take on some additional risks I think it's still a good option.
All three options neglect to mention recovery. For that your most secure bet is going to be memorization, after that it's memorization with encryption and a good (off-site) hiding spot, and then a good off-site hiding spot.
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:36:13
I don't know the specifics but in theory there is no strategy that gives you an edge so the guesses are random. To keep pools and separate miners from doing the same work they can assign ranges of nonces or a unique transaction order.
That being said I wouldn't be too surprised if some miners have developed a secret sauce they believe gives them an edge. At the very least you can be certain they're always looking for one. I know ASIC Boost gives an advantage but I have since forgotten how that's accomplished.
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:03:51
It's not just leading zeros.
For the sake of ease let's pretend there's a hashing function that produces an eight bit hash and that's what bitcoin uses. Let's seed our target with 0111 1111 or 127 in decimal.
Buncha miners jump on board and before you know it the network has created 2016 blocks with hashes &lt; 127. Time to adjust the target. Some magic calculation later and the new target is 0100 0000 or 64 in decimal.
Also, the nonce doesn't have to be iterative. It's just another way miners can produce different hashes.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:02:11
Probably not for a while. Internet speeds have stalled due to financial interest in stalling progress. Not unlike the way the auto industry killed public transportation in the U.S. and now our freeways are parking lots.
I was originally a big block advocate when Gavin started his blog series on the subject. Per the discussions I came to the conclusion I was wrong and though smaller blocks did alienate some use cases we were hoping to corner I believe it keeps the network safer in the long term.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:53:24
I have to say I haven't used it. I think I would want to clarify why someone is doing things that way.
In my mind that option is very similar to option  I mentioned but with some additional potential exploits. They can be mitigated so if you're aware of those potential exploits then you should be as secure as the method I described in  with a bit less fuss.
I do worry that it gives people just enough rope to hang themselves. Like I said, digital security is difficult and Electrum* making it appear easy and convenient using an air gapped machine *can* send the wrong message.
I'm afraid I don't have a clearer answer than that. :)
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:37:25
You don't decrypt signed transactions because they're not encrypted. If it's in JSON format you can just read it with notepad.
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:39:36
You got me �� These topics are a bit beyond what I can help with.
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:09:40
I haven't done a lot of work with raw transactions so I had to look this up. Apologies if it's not 100% correct.
Transactions are comprised of a list of inputs and outputs. The Bitcoin sum of the input list will be less than (or equal to in theory) the output list in a valid transaction.
Each input includes a previous transaction identifier, an index to the output to be spent (which the network will verify has not been spent already) and a script. The scripts can be used a bunch of different ways but this is where the signature is provided. Meaning a signed transaction will have a signature for each input. At no point are the signatures combined as that is not how private key signatures work.
Don't take my word for this though. You can read about transactions here: 
And you can read an overview about scripts here: 
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:56:09
Nope! A block with just a coinbase transaction is allowed by the network.
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:20:59
Biggest threat to Bitcoin security in my mind is SHA256. Miners are incentivized maintain the current algorithm as long as possible and I don't know what means of consensus we have for selecting a new algorithm. It's undoubtedly going to get messy and will look a lot like the big block debates.
We're not in immediate danger but I do wish this were discussed more.
While a nation holding more than 51% of the hashing power isn't ideal it's not as big of a concern in my mind. Exercising a double spend using that vector would topple the price hurting not only the owners of Bitcoin but the miners as well.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:42:25
Your savings are stable if you've been buying consistently. Volatility isn't some magical barrier that prevents people from using Bitcoin to save.

@_date: 2019-10-13 20:52:16
I'm not sure if I'm understanding your question. The explorers I use make little to no effort to determine owners. I've seen them identify ownership of addresses receiving the coinbase since that's fairly easy to do with mining pools.
Other than that yes they're just adding up all the inputs and outputs to give you a view of the public address balances. If we exclude errors and or malicious intent by the the explorer those numbers are definitive. You can make some educated guesses about which addresses are controlled by one entity with some digging but it's not going to be 100% foolproof.

Honestly we should all be relieved that public attention isn't on Bitcoin right now. U.S. general elections are a shit show that pervert almost all discussions deemed related to the election.

I could even see both candidates agreeing it's evil as an attempt to appear bipartisan.

So, I don't pretend to understand economics and for a while every time this was brought up there were people saying it's not a big deal because it's just a few days and then gets paid back. Therefore it's not really injecting money because it's so short lived. I avoid blaming dissenting opinions on shills so I took the alarm with a grain of salt.
But reading through the article I noticed this:


"Longer-maturity term repo operation" sounds like a fancy term for what would be called a loan in any other conversation. Which _would_ be injecting money, currently it's on the order of weeks but given the word "new" this hasn't been done before. It seems like they're avoiding that word here because a loan in this context is cause for alarm. Right?
(Seriously looking for explanations and dissenting opinions here.)
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:32:15

Yes, Bitcoin's fatal flaw is that transactions which aren't on chain can be double spent. Why this comes as a shock to people astounds me. 0-confirmation "transactions" are no different than me flashing money (since the broadcast can be used to determine if I control the necessary bitcoin) and telling you I'll pay you "soon".
RBF existed long before the spec was introduced. If anything the BIP was created to _underscore_ the risk of 0-confirmation transactions due to many people acting like they weren't risky. Miners pick the transactions. This has been the case since the beginning. In the event of two competing transactions and one with a higher fee which do you think they'll pick? They don't give a shit about the RBF flag anymore than Google cares about your "do not track" flag.

When my friend started getting into Bitcoin I told him to do everything he wanted to do with $10~ at first. Buy Bitcoin, buy something with Bitcoin, send it to another address, send it to an address managed by a hardware wallet (buy a hardware wallet like Trezor), wipe the hardware wallet and use the recovery seed to get it back, verify you can send that recovered Bitcoin. Don't worry if you lose any of this $10 while you are experimenting. The lessons you are learning are what will allow you to handle larger amounts.
Digital security is _tough_. Do not ever, ever, ever type out your seed on a digital device other than a hardware wallet. (Buy a hardware wallet.) If you break this rule immediately transfer all funds to an address generated by a new seed.
Read up a bit on private key signatures and hash functions. Perhaps a few articles on how seeds are used to generate private keys.
And buy a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-11 17:12:13
I believe the question was, does this mean they can restrict access to my bitcoin? And the answer is no as long as you have your seed.

Also: make sure you understand how to keep it safely. Many people have lost Bitcoin because they did not understand the technology.
