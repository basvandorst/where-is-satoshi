Someone explain to me this please, how does selling bitcoin mean that people don't understand the technology?
I love the technology, but I don't consider it as an investment. 
For an early adopter, who realized its potential, the price going up from 1$ to 1000$ is great, now that the price is around 350$, it is still great, however yeah, they did take a hit.
But for someone, who bought 1 bitcoin at 1000$, and now that the price is at 350$, should he hold onto the bitcoin only because the technology is great?
I personally do not care if the price of the bitcoin drops to 100$, why ? because I believe in the technology, and to believe in it and use it, I don't have to hold 1000's of bitcoins.  A lot of people, are not investing in this technology, but are simply using it. For people, who complain about the price, are not in it for the technology but only consider it as an investment. The price fluctuations only worry them.
PS: its just my way of thinking, you might disagree with me

Can someone explain what just happened?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:26:27
I happened to have invested a significant amount on bitcoin when the prices were at 520. But within a week or 2 the prices went to 450. And I was in depression. People on forums and subreddits said HOLD, but I didn't listen , and sold most of it accepting a 10-20% loss. Soon in the next 2 days price went down to 400..and I was happy I didn't take a bigger loss. And now its at 290, and I couldn't be more satisfied with the decision I took then. Thing is, at every falling stage I just read people say HOLD. But I don't get it why? If you know the price is going down, why not sell it, and buy it at a lower price and then HOLD. Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do about the stress. If you have decided to hold, then thats the best move. But if you can't accept a 200$/bitcoin, then sell it, and don't take any risks.

Count me in, if you come back to offer again . Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-15 06:22:57
I really hope you guys get your money back.  They should take full responsibility for a product they sell.  They would definitely suffer a bigger loss than simply refunding a machine which was completely their fault.

You just need to get into the CHina mining pools. Not the online ones, but the physical ones. The chinese mine bitcoins dirt cheap, by duplicating the ASIC miner chips, and low mining costs. An investment of 1 btc fetches you a return of 1.8 btc by the end of the month. Another reason for the fall of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:33:34
The miners have become racist.
JK. Maybe wait for another hour. Should be accounted in the next block. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:07:36
Ofcourse he will....To sell those 30 K bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:42:04
I was just kidding about the P&amp;D :)
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:26:32
Pump and Dump. I still don't understand, why the price matters so much. At one point, I thought about converting my savings into bitcoins, but can't take the risk. For now, I just use the technology when I need it. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:45:04
Why would that cause the price to drop?
@_date: 2014-12-25 11:55:23
Really nice giveaway :)
Merry Christmas ! :)

They show it or don't show it, they have your coins. And in either case can disappear overnight. So don't be stupid enough to leave your coins on any dice site

Its all lies! 
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:24:28
Thats actually a very different thing. People lose money on shares as well. But giving it to an anonymous entity is an entirely different thing. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:51:26
You are justifying investing in those anonymous operations because you don't like the real world. You are one of the stupid guys I have made the post about 
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:45:36
They usually don't. They post an address where all the funds are present. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:38:51
eh thats something different . The coins still have value. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:38:30
I am not mad. I just find it funny that the same individuals will later come back and create threads claiming they were scammed and blaiming bitcoin for it. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:20:38
Someone from Cryptsy is downvoting the post and all the comments on it.  Fishy stuff
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:12:38
That sucks. I hope one of the Cryptsy users comment on this. I just withdrew 5 BTC from that site after reading this just as a precaution. 
Even if you apply for a US visa, this is how I predict will end:
alkin : Hey , Applying for US VISA 
interviewer:  Sure sir, Purpose of visit ?
alkin: My money was seized by a bitcoin exchange which is based in US. 
interviewer:  Sorry sir, your visa has been rejected. Your money now belongs to the United States of America.

I remember a complaint against an ATM company a few days back. The guy postd on reddit, and company apologized on here , and delivered the refund. 
I think the same should happen with this. 
180 BTC is almost 50K$.  Its what I earn in 1.5 years. There is no way on earth they should be allowed to seize funds, just because you had problems verification..
They don't want to do business with you. Fine, give back your money, and not allow you in future. But blocking you and seizing your funds. The most shittiest thing they can do. 
Is this how they earn their money ? 
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:49:29
I just went to an investment gambling site PRC, seems they have 2700 bitcoins under them as well. I want to take this opportunity to request people to invest there so it can benefit the casino operator down the line when he plans to take it all away :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:46:21
I don't think its a case of money or BTC laundering. if he had to do that, all he would have done was create paper wallet, and put it in a bank locker, not give it to a third party over the internet for safe keeping. 
Also regarding counterfeit money, they would not keep the counterfeit money and also ask you to take out all your money from your pockets, and then tell you to leave . They need to report this to the government if its a concern. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:54:54
I don't want to say the site, because probably more stupid people will flock to it. Anyways, I am rather shocked. An Analogy, its like a guy who wears a mask and sits on the street 10 blocks away, and uses my money to bankroll the casino house for the gambling business he runs. And I am supposed to trust him by leaving money there and hope its still there along with any profits the next time I visit there. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:54:39
Cryptsy shows no proof that they are going to the police with the funds. Looks what happened after all this. They are funding themselves with that money , and that too on a chance that it was money laundering case. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:13:27
When the thread started all negative comments were downvoted to 0. It was later, it started increasing ;)
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:42:32
Valid point, but 2 things. If the original owner left the funds, and lost the password to it or was hacked, then he would have probably contacted Cryptsy through other means, because its 50K $ . 
If he just left it there, and someone hacked his account, then its his fault to leave his funds online like that without 2FA .
I am sure this is a regular case, but Cryptsy should then make the use of 2FA compulsary over 1 BTC amount. Not locking accounts and keeping the funds to fund their own parties. 
If you look at ops previous post, they have not even replied to his tickets. If he is the actual owner, then this is no way to respond to a customer . This is Day Light robbery.

If you go to a shop and pay with your dads credit card , and you have no verification or ID, then they don't keep the card and the money from your pockets
