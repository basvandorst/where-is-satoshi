hahaha! I disagree

haha! if they have to follow someone else's lead they would at least make their own word for it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:01:02
why is that?

Where is Human Rights when you need them?

"After a 10-fold rise it is time to get defensive now, ideally sell your initial capital so you can keep all crypto for free, riskless. That is how to manage your portfolio, especially an extremely volatile asset like crypto."
This sounds like a good advice.

The rest of the Americans think:
27% said the coins are difficult to understand
18% deemed them a scam 
16% considered them too expensive because they are in a price bubble

The government is up on arms because it does not understand what cryptocurrency can do to the economy in the future. With all the renewable energy sources that the world is putting up, I think we are ready for this.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:01:39
that's a good point
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:36:23
That could be good too. The 8% gets to become billionaires first then the rest can follow with whatever is left.

I guess it's because it is one of the highly urbanized state in the US. Must be pretty tough accommodating everybody.

I think only the real investors and techie would easily invest on BTC or any other crypto.

must be the reason why the missile tests they had for the past months have been failing.

hahaha! the article actually states all cryptos 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:11:34
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:10:17
well, it would be a good time to get more
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:50:22
I read an article yesterday that if you have gotten at least 100% of your investment it would be good to sell your original investment at this point so all of your remaining cryptos would be risk-free

Better late than totally fighting against it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:13:08
Though 8% of the total population of the US is still a big number.

This is the first time I've seen a newspaper did this. Usually bitcoin is only on the news if it skyrocket or if it crashes
