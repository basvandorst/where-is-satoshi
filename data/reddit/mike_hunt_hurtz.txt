This is my understanding, someone correct me if I'm wrong.  In order for someone to carry out malicious attacks on a blockchain their computing power would have to atleast be more then the hashrate of the network in question. Centralization whether that's considered 51% of computing power. But I was also thinking.. what if someone gets a node to send out malicious software to every node to scramble it. I'm sure people would catch on rather quickly as full saturation of such may take awhile

You have no clue how sheltered I was.. man I've seen greed in my life and dark shit on the internet.. but boy none of that compares.. I see people often shilling shitcoins getting people to buy in with money they don't have so that they can turn a quick buck.. once buy orders strengthen they dump 1000s of dollars worth on the poor unsuspecting noobs leaving nothing but a crushed spirit and a bill unpaid.
 I hear it all the time don't invest with money you can't afford to lose.. that shit irks me. Why not rather educate people on smart investments because regardless what anyone says I see people flock in by the 100s everyday with FOMO. This is our modern day gold rush and I have taken it upon myself to help all the newcomers I can to educate them and which signs to watch out for, if we can all manage to not push people off to better ourselves, crypto as a whole  will do much better. 
But just because I see greed all the time doesn't mean their are not people who help. I have had 2 mentors help me from the bottom, without them I wouldn't know 1/4 of what I know now.

Wow just the opposite for me.. I made a post awhile back about me trading btc for my kiddos glasses and a lady donated .015 btc to me to cover glasses.. it's been an unfortunate year for me.. I'm a seasonal painter and my bosses wife got a cancer death sentence so no work for me.. no unemployment didn't make enough.. 
 On top of that I have 2 vehicles neither run.. i don't have health insurance and my kiddo broke her glasses and I couldn't replace them. I can't even make rent atm and at this point about to give up. That ladies generous donation made me cry like a little bitch. I know people are skeptical about giving donations to random ppl online because most are fraud. I had proof of all my shortcomings and she didn't want a single document.  I truly am one to go above and beyond to help everyone I can and when. I hit the ground not a one person lent me help.  I know I'm not entitled and I have to work for my own but damn man . Sometimes crypto is beautiful.. 
Edit, I often dream about finding a flash drive with a BTC wallet on it.. with 10btc on it.. .5 of a BTC even.

Wow, ya man I invested a measily 10$ it's all I could afford trying to get rich scheme.. lol I made it up to 20$ and lost 80% in one coin overnight.. I found out the hard way research is key.  Iwas down in life in general trying to get enough to get my kiddo glasses thru coastal.com they accept Bitcoin ohh boy did I have it all wrong.. I'm ok now and about 1\3rd to the .013 btc it'll cost for her glasses so I'm doing alot more research now, and if it keeps going good she will be able to see again early January ��. I knew of blockchain and kinda how it worked beforehand but I've sucked up alot of useful information in the last 3 weeks. Ty for your time take care

This is the internet.. regardless of how you perceive shit to be it's never the case.  What I can for sure say though. .. if you have that attitude and outlook towards life in general being uptight you will become miserable real quick.  I used to be the gogogogo stop playing around type of person, real straight forward. 
What changed my outlook is I was humbled, I won't say how but I will tell you I appreciate life much more and even if I can't relate I still try to understand other people's perspective. This whole shit ramble is basically life is to damn short to be so serious all the damn time. Yes this is a sub for bitcoin news but it's also Reddit. To expect anything different would be silly. I hope you too can find what it is you seek to take the gas pedal to 1/2 throttle, idk if you can relate to any of the bullshit I said but if you can slow down man. Appreciate the small things and enjoy life even if you are broke and poor smile more . A smile goes a long way, you could be making someone's week with that smile.  Have a great week man.

Ok.. I'll eli5 for u. If a company or product or any item for instance follows the original blueprints/plan how are they going to overcome the flaws? Everything always has some sort of flaw..  to say bch is more like the white paper only means it will never evolve into something better than a rudimentary altcoin...  Personally as a consumer I don't want the first revision of shit to have red ring of death in 2 months.
Sears was built on selling watches.. they kept adding to their catalog untill they were selling mail ordered houses, then at one point were the largest retailer untill Walmart took over.   
Last but not least bcash is a contingency plan for bitmain to continue to use asicboost on their miners nothing more.. the only reason it's relevant is the billionaire shills pushing their false propaganda.  people have all these claims about what bcash supposedly is or isn't and your opinion has already been persuaded based on your perception.  Perception is everything. Don't chock up something as a whole based on one shitty person.. unless that person is the face of said situation/product/crypto/company

Honestly I feel if you are here just to hodl then you are interested in nothing but the gains, I never understood how someone had that train of thought  and at the same time were all for mass adoption. If  everyone who owns btc doesn't sell and just hodls how will it overtake fiat if it isn't used as a currency and just a store of value?  I don't have alot of room to talk as I was just earning an income for awhile not holding at all but I did spend alot of earned btc  at an assortment of retailers including Rx glasses for my kiddo.

Not to be a Debbie downer but these fucks act like exchanges havent run off like the wild west with funds of users.. I remember a yobit post someone had 150btc seized dude blasted them and they returned them shortly after. Just because binance is huge and makes a killing what's to say they couldn't use 8million of unaccounted funds? Or who is to say the team involved didn't want a nice early bonus and an easy your fraudulent sorry for your loss.  This is crypto not wallstreet it would not surprise me if they are being shady. Everyone has thoughts of I'll intentions it's seems crypto has all the ones who act on those..

It's not that.. he is not getting paid in bitcoin he is trying to take his European bank account $$ and transfer it into his Canadian bank account and use crypto as the middle man instead of big banks.. do you understand now? 
 He doesn't want to wait 3 weeks for the money to arrive.  
So here ill eli5. 
 Bill has 2300$ in Europe. He wants to send this 2300$ to Jane on Canada.
 Billy doesn't want to use a bank as a middle man and wait for 3 weeks for the funds to arrive. 
 Billy thought of possibly buying crypto and sending crypto to Jane so she could then sell her crypto for fiat in Canada.  
 Billy soon found out the wait times and fees to transfer from fiat to crypto and then crypto back to Canadian fiat is up to 3 times more and longer than big banks.  
Now do you guys understand or did you not read his whole post?

I'm sorry there isn't an outlet to help you. I understand what you are trying to achieve even though most of the commenters here can't comprehend. I don't know why a company hasn't thought of this yet and dominated big banks. I believe the problem is trusting people to not do a reversal of funds once applied to crypto.. it's a shame as scammers and fraudsters are the ones stopping this most likely. That and kyc.

Shit bro.. I feel ya! My bosses wife died I lost my job over it he gave up working.. I got denied unemployment, I have 2 vehicles both of which broke down. My friend loaned me an old beater Honda and that took a dump.. can't afford baby sitter in top of not having a reliable vehicle.. so I said fuck it! 
I got 1$ from coinbase in 2014 that turned into 15$ Nov last year I transferred to an exchange and started trading.. I was up to 3200$ in btc purely investing in shitcoins 3 days before rent was due the exchange I just sold shitcoins on tanked.   (down 4 maintenance) that was over a month and 10 days ago it took me 10hrs a day 6 days a week losing my ass and tons of research to achieve this.. at this point I'm considering my btc gone. Idk wtf to do I was relying on that shit and some pajeets are most likely pulling the slowest exit scam in history...

Lol.. I'd suck a dick on the streets if some shit happened and it was what I'd have to do for my kids to eat. Why the passive aggressive approach? You misunderstood.. I work in construction where there is no benifets hence no retirement. ATM I can't afford to find a 401k to invest in. I get paid monthly and just rented a new house at 1700$ a month in a Podunk little town in Oregon. That rent alone is half my paycheck plus bills groceries and it's gone. Im not low-key asking for handouts I want to literally try and make a worry free future for my kids so they don't have to work as hard as me. I may not be the best parent in the world but no poor bastard should have to endure the shit I've had to trying to do right.. and for damn sure I'm going to gobble some decks before my kids ever have too..   honestly btc is my only hope to do this so I'ma go all in and hopefully shitty people don't ruin it for us all.
