I think if you truly believe in the fundamentals of a coin it is much easier to hodl than if you just hodl a coin to get rich.

In deed! But this two things go typically hand in hand.

I think he refers to a game called [Where's Wally?]( also known as [Where's Waldo?](

Sounds familiar.

Really tough decision. I would prefer checkboxes instead of radio buttons to mark both options. But I guess twitter does not support this ;).

Ohh thanks for the info! Didnt knew that. I will add the link to my favorites. I am quite new to reddit. Does it make sense to delete this post now?

Correct me if I am wrong but based on this chart it more looks like it bounces of the 100 day moving average and not the 50 day average (which is in fact the 55 day average)? This means there is still room to fall a little bit more. But hopefully the next bull run is not to far away so we do not need to touch the 100 day moving average.

I would go even a step further: Take everything you read on any site with a good dose of skepticism. Most sites are heavily biased either pro Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Get your information from multiple sources and then try to understand what you read and then try to decide for yourself whats right and whats wrong. I know this is much harder then just following one opionion maker but its worth the effort! By doing that I could personaly decide for myself that only Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin without trusting someone blind.

Good news: I put your question in the first yes-no-oracle I found (googled "yes no oracle") and the answer is yes! 100k confirmed! Here is the proof:

First of all congratulations! But a friendly piece of advice: Never ever tell someone how many Bitcoins you have - especially if you own as much.

Lets see if christmas sale can top this discount ;).

The short answer is yes. If you want to know why I absolutely can recommend you the [YouTube\-Channel of Andreas Antonopoulos]( Especially the video [Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Why running a node is important]( which answer your question most likely in detail. In my opinion Andreas Antonopoulos is a very good source if you want to learn more about Bitcoin/Crypto.

Based on my experience predicting if a post will get up or downvoted is like trying to predict if the price of bitcoin will go up or down (in short term) ;). Furthermore, most people sort post only by the hot level (default sorting). This means if a post does not get enough upvotes in the first place it will not land on the field of view for most people and it will get lost under all other posts.

In terms of usability I also can recommend [anycoindirect.eu]( without any concerns. Their site is well designed, the verification process is fast and straight forward and the sell (and buy) process is very simple so most probably even newcomers will have no problems.
The only downside are the fees. Compared to classic exchanges with support for EUR pairs like kraken, bitstamp, GDAX(/Coinbase) and so on the fees are much higher so you get less Euros for your Bitcoins. That said you must decide for yourself if the comfort is worth it (then use [anycoindirect.eu]( or if you want to get the most out of your Bitcoins (then use a classic exchange).

Thanks for the response! But the node does also not have an URI and the date for Last Update does not make sense, too.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:42:18
Just to be sure: Do you mean a lambo toy car or a real one ;)?

Thank you!

Based on  there are currently "only" 999 Nodes. But anyway, congratulations :)! I get more and more excited about the Lighting Network. Can’t wait for it to be useable for everyday use.
Edit: Now  also passed 1,000 nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:57:27
Since the testnet has currently 1842 ([Source]( nodes and the mainnet has 887 nodes ([Source]( it must be the mainnet.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:14:17
Based on the [chart]( (since activation) it also looks like we reached a new ATH with 18.43%
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:58:14
And counting :)!

In terms of energy consumption I really can recommend this YouTube video by Andreas Antonopoulos: [Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Energy consumption](
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:45
Who does not want it, already has it. I personally think there are plenty power provider willing to sell electricity for bitcoin mining. Their loss.

That's why I asked "What do you think?". Maybe tomorrow they wont delay but decline the ETF. That's also possible (even if the article talks just about an approveral).
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:56:05
You are right about the back and forth but this article is still "new" (even if its the same old story). I thought it would still be interesting. But based on my downvotes it looks like I was wrong ;). Next time I know better :).
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:12:14
Thanks for the kind words :)!
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:24:32
The news is already 3 days old but as far as I can tell nobody else posted it which is surprisingly. I know that Bitcoin does not need a Bitcoin ETF to succeed but I am still curios what will happen tomorrow. What do you think?
Edit: I personally don't bet on an approval. I think:
* 70% delay
* 20% decline
* 10% approve
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:43:30
That's most probably the safest bet ;). I assume the same.
