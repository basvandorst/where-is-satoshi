That's not how speculative sell offs work. Any speculation is subject to downward price pressure from panic selling crashing it.
Someone sees the price go down, they try to sell to protect their gains, need to lower the price to find a buyer, 2 people see that lower price, decide to sell to protect thier gains, need to lower the price to find a buyer, 4 more people see that lower price, and on and on until a Bitcoin and $1 will get you a cup of coffee at McDonalds.
Remember Bitcoin has no backing of anything. It has no intrinsic value. It generates no economic value, no income, no tax advantage, is is not backed by any government as legal tender for a debt, it has no assets to give it a book value. It literally has a floor of $0.

If this were an equity, I'd agree with you. A company has assets to back it up, it has book value, it has things you can look at to derive a base value for it's floor. So you can properly see what multiple you are paying for the equity based on the floor 
The floor for Bitcoin has always been, and always will be, $0. Which means when the bubble pops, it pops FAST. It has no resistance on the way down at any price point. There is no intrinsic or underlying value backstopping a sell off. That's why you get so any flash crashes.

Greed. The desire for lazy people to make money without having to do anything for it is infinite. Bitcoin is early the lasted thing being used to facilitate that

5 "corrections" of this size is not normal. And it;s not a correction because the price of Bitcoin is based on nothing, so there's nothing to "correct" too
