Bcash is a scam because it's founder tried to coopt the 'Bitcoin' brand and acts like a fucking tool when people insist that Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin and should be called e.g. Bcash.
Also there are rumours that Roger Ver was part of the initial pump and dump and made off like a robber with his huge gains. Now he's bought back in and trying to build it up again so he can simple wash rinse repeat. The evidence for this is hard to track down due to the nature of blockchain.
Edit: hey downvoters, Roger Ver literally said, "Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin." He basically tried to take something successful, copy it and replace it, mainly for his own benefit and financial gain.

Me neither. I started low (£200) and then a couple bigger (£500 or so) then just sent £1000 but I wouldn't be that comfortable going much higher. I'm dabbling, not putting in more than I'd be able to survive losing entirely.

The options are not limited to 1 side or the other telling the truth. They both could be.
It could be that he made an error in the transfer. He could have used the wrong account or used the wrong reference or something.
There is a red flag of sorts in the OP's text. Coinbase is not a Ponzi scheme, and to label it as one makes you look a bit stupid.
However I can totally believe that his $40k is stuck somewhere because of human error and that Coinbase have been slow to track it down.
It seems people with problems go to reddit to try to shame Coinbase into action.

If they were robbing people, it'd be the little guy, because it's the little guy that has next-to-no resources to pursue legal action.
I've made multiple transfers to CoinBase without problems. Probably all 'chump change' to you though.

Maybe not. But they can easily understand handing you a $20 in exchange for basic goods or services.
Now, try and hand me bitcoin. QR codes? Bitcoin addresses? Oh, my wallet was Bitcoin Cash? I mean... it's very complicated for a basic transaction, whereas hard cash is pretty obvious and straight forward for it.

Are you intending to say that Bitcoin would NOT have suffered these scaling problems had they left it alone? That is what you are saying when you say this.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:05:50
I disagree. This would be really hand for me. At the moment I can be a bit too keen on watching the exchange. This would give me an 'at a glance' overview that doesn't take up my entire screen.

If the price drops to $10 then I'll climb Mt Everest naked. That's just not happening dude short of some crazy fucking circumstance.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:16:34
Even the extra monitor doesn't help that much, because there's so much information on an exchange screen with graphs and orders etc. It is hard to just 'glance' at it.

How about this for a novel idea: let's judge each one on its merits.

There is no market manipulation organised or in consultation with the operators of Bitcoin Core. You keep making this false equivalence between bad actors in a space and bad actors running a space. You can't control all traders and prevent attempts to game the market but you can't be a trader gaming the market who runs a cryptocurrency. Well, you can, and that's what Ver did and hes left a trail of destruction in his wake.
I personally believe that he loses zero sleep over the lives hes ruined because he comes across as a sociopath.
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:39:45
I always try to determine what is true. Truth can not be altered, only the perception of it.
Anything I learned about Roger Ver had red flags all over it. The fact that r/btc spent so much effort trying to discredit BTC, that they used the Bitcoin twitter handle to constantly diminish BTC, and that they used [bitcoin.com]( to try to subvert BTC screamed out manipulation. There was so much deception that I deemed the general BCash community untrustworthy and as such disengaged with it entirely.
Whilst it is not always easy to find out who to trust, it is usually quite easy to see who is not being honest because they are not interested in debating things on merit and use dishonest tactics and deception to try to impose their will. (Coincidentally why I determined all religions to be BS. The discussion is never about the truth, albeit religious advocates fling that word around with alternative meaning.)
It sucks that you lost out. The crypto sphere, like all financial utilities, is a sea full of sharks that fill their bellies then move on leaving destruction in their wake.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:34:54
I have seen no concerted effort from the Bitcoin community and certainly not from its leaders to discredit Bitcoin Cash.
I have seen no websites pretending to sell Bitcoin Cash but really selling Bitcoin.
I have seen no major social media accounts named BitcoinCash saying Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin Cash.
Please tell me, what is untrue about what I am saying? BCash was a community trying to reap the rewards of Bitcoin. It was a very dishonest endeavour by Ver and that was made clear by his refusal to accept BCash was not Bitcoin and his subversion of major Bitcoin channels.
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:22:32
Well he was a prominent figure behind the original fork and now the ABC fork of the fork.
What do you even mean by run or operate? He seems to be heavily influential in the history of BCash and Bitcoin ABC, which CoinMarketCap have since 'merged' as a listing.


Plenty of citations on the Bitcoin Cash wikipedia page.

I mean, he literally pushed for the formation of first Bitcoin Cash then Bitcoin ABC which is now recognised as Bitcoin Cash.
He and his mates pumped Bitcoin Cash then dumped it once it spiked. That is pretty much not up for debate. They made a LOT of money. They ruined a LOT of people.
They are being sued.
So I'm not sure why you want to have your head in the sand on the issue. Short of Roger Ver publicly admitting all these things, there's so many bread crumbs out there that it's hard not to look at it and cringe.
@_date: 2019-03-23 19:42:51
I personally believe BCash to be a scam. Roger Ver wanted control of Bitcoin and this was his way to do it and make him and his buddies ridiculous riches in the process. The motivations have never been demonstrated, from what I can tell in all the articles I've read and interviews I've seen, to be noble. It was pumped then dumped and you can't kid anybody into thinking that Ver didn't know that was going on.
If calling a spade a spade makes you "aggressive" and a counterweight to a very badly intentioned other side, then I question why you would decide that there needs to be a balance in the first place? Truth, honesty, integrity are not subjective issues.
It's like having the NRA on TV after a mass shooting to justify keeping military grade weapons legal. It's a fucking nonsense.

They charge a fee like that for transactions within Coinbase, not just for the initial transfer. So I bought Litecoin. When I sold it, £2.99 fee. When I try to buy Ethereum, £2.99 fee again! How can you make money on anything other than huge investments if they are charging fees that eat a few % every single time you buy/sell!?
@_date: 2019-12-26 11:39:36
Also nothing grows infinitely. That's brilliant that you got an amazing return on BTC when you bought before it's price exploded, but this Oprah-esque notion of free money for everybody is a little silly. It's essentially a shared pool so for every person that makes 10,000% there is many somebody elses footing that bill.

I don't get this. Surely that should have been liquidated in order to repay whatever they could, not horded for future gains.

How is it center left to advocate for things like zero regulation, complete market control of everything. I think you need to do a bit more research.

What? Where why who what how is the conservative movement understated? I mean, they have Fox News FFS. Progressives don't even have representation on TV.


How is the conservative movement misrepresented? I mean, they voted for Trump and got him.

No but similar experiments can show similar mentality. I can't remember the source but there's the "waiting room" experiment where a waiting room of actors at a doctor or dentist stand up every time some cue occurs (e.g. a beep). A real patient walks in, and quickly joins everybody in standing at the cue. Over time the actors are called in and leave, replaced by actual patients until there are no actors left but the people in the waiting room maintain the behaviour even though none of them know why they are standing.

I sold 7btc for $42 around the same time you did, and didn't even get the $42 as Mt.Gox folded before I could get properly approved for withdrawls.  I think I got a cheque for £1.89 or something a few years back that I intended to frame but lost it in a pile of paper somewhere.

You live in some illusionary land where people aren't being scammed out of their life savings (I have not, but I have read plenty of horror stories on reddit and in other forums). I have no time for theoretical nitwits. Real people have been badly hurt by textbook scam artists and it needs regulation, period.
What that regulation is needs to be decided, but to just let it all play out is just foolish, and to advocate that makes you look worse than my language. It just creates a wild west for scammers to abuse over, and over, and over again.
PS. I don't give 2 fucks about upvotes. Upvotes don't determine truth. Consensus doesn't determine truth. Facts are not decided by opinions.

Fraud needs regulating. Period.
If Ver was transparent about his ownership of [bitcoin.com]( / r/btc /  then this would not be a problem. It is a problem because he is trying to claim ownership of the Bitcoin brand and using this very obvious public presence to mislead people into purchasing BCash.

Oh fuck off will you. This is how people get conned out of vast sums of money, then pricks like you turn around and say, "Well you could have boycotted and refused to participate."
If you are one of these idiots who thinks zero regulation is needed and that "the markets will fix themselves" then let's not waste each other's time because it's a moronic position to take. A lot of damage is preventable before it occurs, rather than letting some people take the fall so others can find out who to avoid.

Third rule of Bitcoin is to send 0.5btc to [this address]( in order to receive 5btc in return.
