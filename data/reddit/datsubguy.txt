I am new to this....I am trying to respond with a screenshot on my portfolio. Is that possible?
Regardless. My current holdings:
$KL (this is always the exception)
I also have several cryptocurrencies totaling around $1000 USD in cold storage.

IMHO....we are gonna see these ups and downs, but as soon as the Asian market comes on, we will go up much more steadily then we have seen downs during todays and coming days sessions. 
US markers send it on these rollercoaster rides, and when we all go to bed at night the global markets push it up, up, up. Thank you China, thank you Hong Kong...thank you Korea.
This market is so much more evolved globally then it was in 17. 
Fun fact: 100,000 in HK is about 13,000 in USD. 
HK is going to be lit the F up tonight when they see that BTC has reached 100,000 HKD.

I am just beginning, and just started really investing on 6/1/19. 
I definitely need to clean my portfolio up, as it is still evolving, but I feel I have performed decently having been up 11% in just a few weeks.
