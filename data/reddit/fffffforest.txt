I believe in crypto - I don't believe in such a ridiculous technical analysis. What you just said is textbook gambler's fallacy.

They invested too much so they are going to keep buying if the price goes below $8000?

Who won't allow it to? Are you planning on buying all of the Bitcoin that gets listed at $8k?

The entire front page really. There were a bunch of posts about Wendy's recently, then another post about a box that looked like a smiley face with a huge tampon logo on it. I am pretty convinced at this point that half of the things here are hidden adverts.

I'm sure there are exceptions but American Express generally issues charge cards, not credit cards. The difference is that charge cards aren't meant to carry balances. So, yeah, probably a fee.

There was never child porn on the silk road. Pretty much just drugs and some hacked Netflix accounts. I don't even think weapons were allowed to be sold there.

Anyone involved with half a brain is going to let the police believe that they caught the one and only perpetrator. Not saying that I believe that theory, but it's definitely possible.
