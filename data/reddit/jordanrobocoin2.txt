It's not a "scheme" if the operator is honest about it. It's a game.

I am the owner/operator of the internationally successful start-up Robcoin. We were instrumental in leading the bitcoin industry with KYC/AML Bitcoin ATM Machine machines. My last 2 accounts and got messed up somehow but I live on and am here to answer your questions. Fire away!
Edit: going to do a shot and a line or two, be back soon to answer any remaining questions.

The intent is to provide users with a sense of pride and accomplishment for dealing in virtual currency.
As for the name, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Blockchains and accounted for other adjustments needed before launch. Among other things, we’re looking at maximizing user interaction rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that users have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via operation.
We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets. It should also be stated somewhere that this is a parody account and should not be mistaken for an actual scammer, end disclaimer.
Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.
