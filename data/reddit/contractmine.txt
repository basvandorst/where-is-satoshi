You can go to blockchain.info and do a taint analysis on bitcoin addresses. 
Coinbase of late has become a "shutdown first, answer questions later" like paypal.  You just have to wait for support to answer your question, which may take 2-3 days.  You should be able to transfer your coins out though, they never block that function.  In most cases Coinbase is shutting down accounts that have anything to do with gambling. 
If you think your addresses might be flagged for some reason, you can use a mixer or shapeshift to convert to an altcoin and then back to btc again. 
My recommendation is that if you use coinbase, you should only move coins there from your own wallet and never from a service.

Yup, it's a big shift in the equity marketplace. I've seen companies give away too much in the beginning and the owner and inventor that wanted freedom just ends up having another 9 to 5 and working for a board of directors that slowly eat up more and more equity. There's a bunch of venture capital firms that didn't like kickstarter when it first arrived either. I think this is where will see the most impact on regulation for countries that take an interest, in the ICO and tax sectors. Scams are going to exist whether or not there's an ICO or private investment rounds. The only thing that I like about ICOs (for legitimate projects) is that it give people who are interested in the project the ability to be part of the project. The ones I don't like are the time-travel promising shenanigans that over promise a platform that will never exist and people buy in because they've been led down a road with false expectations. Ledger is a real company and a real project, I think they would have done well in an ICO without giving away equity. I think several years from now, we will see a more legit ICO model that doesn't have the same stigma it has today. I'm glad they raised funding though to continue on...

Other altcoins have gone bust due to massive fraud (ponzi, etc) and hardly made a blip on the market, like paycoin. I honestly just don't see this is a reality that it would have a significant impact on the btc price. We've seen large thefts over the years and it doesn't move the needle much, biggest one I think was probably gox, but bitcoin was just getting its legs then. I'm not worried about tether imploding, seemed sketchy to me all along. I don't even trust those coins out there that are "backed" by some gold deposit, too much risk there.

In my experience, a stress test also implies that something could break which would require a fix or adjustment. I suppose these types of tests couldn't really break the entire system. Although, if something really went wrong, unforeseen and caused some damage to the network, it would seem that testnet would have been a more appropriate sandbox in retrospect. 
There are people out there who want to try to break something just because they want to prove that it can be done. Is the production network the right place for such testing?  I don't know, where does the reality of the transaction processing cross the line?

Some people have written their own interface software for the blockchain rather than using bitcoin-qt and using RPC commands to interface with Bitcoin. So changes require them to go back though a development cycle which they don't want to do because they're already working on other code/projects.

People keep saying that this is a replacement for altcoins but it's not. The point for some altcoins is to not have a dependency on bitcoin at all. Plus, there's the issue of federation in the hands of a few people, which is said to be solved later on.  That's fine too, but still will probably require some type of approval/issuance at some layer. 
This offers a lot of functionality, mainly to keep people away from stuffing bloat into the blockchain. However, in my mind it doesn't replace altcoins. Some of the devs of this have done some controversial things in the past with bitcoin and the client, so having independence from that is important too.

I'm not sure if fees were to blame today. I sent two transactions today and the later one was added to a block and confirmed before the earlier transaction.

It replaces traditional monetary systems that have been in place for a very long time. People can be wary of a new way of doing things because they have a mental comfort zone of doing things in the way they have always done them before.

Ehhhh I didn't like this one. It was interesting but I liked some of the other documentaries better that touched on similar points, such as Deep Web. I didn't really care for the dark themes and styles this one portrayed. While I can appreciate the focus was on bitcoin is a disruptive technology that can level the playing field and aid in political free speech; I felt the video harped on it to the point where Bitcoin became a poorly treated prop for the director. The cinematography wasn't that great such as the interview at the 9:39 mark... an interview is entirely in shadow for no reason. It was just annoying and laid a foundation that Bitcoin is dark and somehow should only be spoken about in shadow. The audio selections were problematic too, an example is where you have someone in a guy fawkes mask making a point about fractional reserve currency being a ponzi scheme.  You can't even hear him because someone is talking with a bullhorn at an event. I just think it needed a better editor to polish it up and brighten the theme and style. It made Bitcoin look like something your grandparents should be afraid of.

Gavin is on the right path. The core developers have side projects which rely more and more on a legacy design for the blockchain. All sorts of companies are trying to use the blockchain now for things that it wasn't meant for. 
We need to move on though and progress is the way forward. Not everyone is going to be happy with what others decide later on either. Will a 20mb block really impact your day to day life? 
I think you're on the right path though, we can't have these debates if they threaten Bitcoin. Otherwise, we'll just have Android-like blockchains or worse a Paypal-like ownership of the development of it.

I'll agree that it hasn't been released it and as such, vapor for the moment. However, it does have an advantage over a hosted solution in the sense that you aren't bound to the restrictions of a hosting provider. As an example, look at  and see the section "Prohibited Businesses".
That being said, Open Bazaar has it's challenges too, such as trust and state-fullness. If people run shops on their desktops and turn them off at night, well, in today's "gotta have it now" economy, that presents an issue. 
I think the value here would be to run the software on a hosting provider that doesn't have severe restrictions and where you build trust with the community over time.

Depends on what your outcome target is. If it's profit, you're looking at a logarithmic scale.  You will add hashing power at cost of equipment and electricity is going to be a huge cost. You will have to continue to add hashing power against the rising network difficulty ( Eventually, you'll plateau where your income is paying for your operating expenses. Unless you're located in China forget about a serious large bitcoin mining operation. All the small-mid players gave up and went to altcoins.

PoW is great, but in the bitcoin world it has separated mining from the need to run a full node. The block reward has turned into a greed-based loop that spiraled an increase in difficulty for the PoW algorithm, which in turn pushed mining to China where power is inexpensive. I believe that some kind mechanism of PoS will be important to Bitcoin in the future.  
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:28:35
Interesting, thanks. I looked at the site and against and then it made sense. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:10:46
I would agree that value and PoW seem to be in conflict when you take network participation into account. I think the development of the FPGA/ASIC-based miners for whatever PoW cryptocurrency that are using SHA256/scrypt algorithms has led to mining and node separation on a 1:1 perspective.

OP, 
There have been many attacks on exchanges and some of them have led to the loss of customer deposits. If you don't control the private keys to your coins, you don't own your coins. 2FA has been bypassed as well for other services, it's a measure of protection, but not completely resistant to attacks. This is done through reset methods by compromising other identity-established systems you might use (port the service on your mobile or attack your email).  Check into trezor or cryptosteel to secure your coins offline.

The mining ecosystem is not healthy in it's current state and needs an overhaul.  While what bitfury developed is innovative, it won't level the playing field again; at least in the US. With the cost of electricity and insanely high difficulty, the "hope" of getting the block reward is just that, hope. The best development for mining recently was really solo.ckpool.org which offers some incentive to return some amount of fairness back into mining. For mining for Bitcoin, either the block reward scheme would need to change or the PoW algorithm would need to change.  However, I doubt we would ever see that happen due to the influence the miners in China now have.  Bitcoin mining needs to change, but other than Luke-Jr, I haven't seen any solutions or ideas offered up.

Get yourself a hardware wallet, like a trezor. Coinbase is not a safe place to keep your bitcoins for a couple of important reasons. The first, is that they can deny access to your coins for any reason they want. The second is that someone could hack you and get access to your coins (2fa won't protect you if they get your phone, etc).

I recommend miners join   It's like pool mining combined with solo mining.  There's about 400 miners on it...
If you find a block, 99% of the reward (25BTC today - 12BTC in about a month :)) + transaction fees get generated directly at your bitcoin address!
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:29:54
It's all about the cost of power, less about affording an ASIC miner. More miners = increased difficulty, which means you need more miners, more power. You can buy a used asic for cheap, it might not be powerful, but it will hash for you.
Unless the PoW algorithm were to change (which will never happen), there's no opportunity for the "little guy" to mine a block and get the block reward. The difficulty is so high you need many TH/s to mine a block and loads of cheap power.  
Your best bet, is to mine an altcoin, then trade in anything you get for bitcoin. Or, get a cheap used miner, join  and hope for the best.

A tough lesson to learn in the bitcoin world. Here are some others:
1) If you don't hold your private key, you don't hold your bitcoin.
2) Keep your bitcoins offline in a hardware wallet (research trezor)
3) Never keep your bitcoins on an exchange for longer than it takes to do a trade, they are a target for hackers and often get hacked, don't take the risk.
4) Don't buy mining equipment from anyone else other than antminer directly from China. There's a lot of mining hardware scammers that sell "pre orders" then vanish with your coins.
5) Remember ABE and 2FA - Always Be Encrypting anything you do on or offline, backups, communications, everything. Always make sure any service you use (even temporarily) has two factor authentication.  Turn on 2FA for your email account, if they don't support 2fa and/or encryption, go elsewhere.
6) If you use any one time password (OTP) for any two-factor services, use an inexpensive phone that is not your main phone and never give the number out to anyone, ever. Tell your phone company to block porting and then pin enable your sim card. 
7) Never, ever, ever re-use a password, invest in a password program like 1password or lastpass. Have patience, take care of your passwords.

It's all a numbers game, if OP wasn't concerned with mining as an investment, no problem. However, there is absolutely no way to mine in 2016 (unless you're in China or another country where power is practically free) and make a profit on a $1000 investment. 
OP wanted to break even with 1k investment in 60 days, not mine to help decentralize the network. So, yeah, it's best to give OP the advice to do something else.
While it's not technically impossible to mine a block using $1000 worth of hardware, it's very highly improbable that it would happen in OP's lifetime.

It's an interesting documentary, but maybe it should have been called the end of paper money instead. I think documentary "The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin" was slightly better. Deep web was pretty decent too, even though it focused too much on DPR. 
One of the things that was a little distracting in this documentary was the overuse clip-videos of government buildings, currency flying/falling/burning, newspaper headlines. At times it was like a bad powerpoint presentation. I know it was just a kickstarter movie, though so not bad. Good but, lots of cliche about bitcoin.

Yet, years later, we see that same person speaking in a way to try to subvert, bend, and corrupt others. John did the best he could, Roger is clearly speaking from a self indulged viewpoint in the interview it was almost absurd to get a dialog going.

I don't suggest using a hash as a form of encryption. A PKI based environment with strong algorithms would be best, enforcing encryption in transit and rest is a good practice. Most people who use a hash for something, typically add a salt as well to help combat against rainbow tables, although not always effective.
At the end of the day, most of these smaller sites don't employ any security standards to safehouse customer data.  It's probably some 14yo in Slovenia who probably used admin/admin for their mysql database credentials.

Agreed, but I recommend devs to use a crypto secure algo to generate a long random salt (ripmd, sha256, sha512). Encrypt the database when at rest and secure access method.
Unfortunately, too many developers use a lamp stack and just next, next, finish and deploy. Some of the stack development uses sha1 or md5 for providing admin or user functions. Security has taken a back step with some of the rapid deployment "gotta have it now" disruptive web applications out there.
This whole event is tragic and shady.

@_date: 2015-07-29 20:20:45
Just my opinion here, but SSH is typically a means to remotely access a machine and run commands. Creating SSH in PHP would potentially expose that capability in an insecure manner.  SSH has it's own native daemon, done correctly with proper encryption (public-private key pair with password) and then correctly firewalled with multi-factor authentication, you have a secure means to access a system remotely for administration.  Creating those functions in PHP, is more difficult to secure, plus the attack surface for PHP 5/6 is much larger than that of SSH. 
While you may want to experiment with creating such a program, doing so for a production system would be bad form. Generally something like that falls into the axiom, "just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should".

VPS's can be a good solution for building a node. I've run into a couple of places that monitor disk i/o to virtual guests and shut off the guest when it goes to high, usually related to restarts when the b-qt starts up.
I built some cheap nodes in the last year by buying used thin clients and storing the blockchain on inexpensive usb drives. Once in awhile, someone will sell a large lot of wired/wireless wyse or hp clients with 8gb of memory on eBay for $10-60 ea (no monitor), add a 128gb usb drive for $12 and you've got a full node with low power requirements for cheap. Some of them only have 2gb of memory, but some models you can open up and add more memory. I got one for $9 that had 2gb, replaced the onboard memory for 16gb for $10. You can also boot them up via usb or pxe and just load linux and not even use the onboard windows. If I have some time later, I'll make a guide.

Anyone can still mine (many still do!), but doing it for profit depends on one's ability to get cheap electricity. However, greed has driven the wrong behaviors, especially with the large farms in China. I got out of mining about a year ago, moved to proof of stake coins, then cash those in for Bitcoin.
Maybe the answers to disrupt the greed in mining rest somewhere in modifying the difficulty and perhaps some other type of multi-factor process to prevent an entity from bogarting the block rewards.

It also became too expensive for home miners to run equipment which were pointed at ghash.io as a mining pool for individuals. As the network mining difficulty rose, you needed more mining equipment to continue to mine and earn from the pool. However, as the price for btc went down, the cost of electricity stayed the same. It became too expensive in most countries (or states) to mine and make a profit. Mining farms moved or started in China or states like Washington where it costs less for electricity. As a result, individuals and smaller farms shutdown and Ghash lost it's ability to compete with the other pools.

The problem is that the wall street companies are making their own private blockchains and not using bitcoin or another popular alt-coin for a public ledger.

I struggled with this myself because I'm building a game (not using SoG assets) that will have game assets on counterparty. I went back and forth on your exact point, (database or blockchain?) and I decided to list the assets on the blockchain. I thought it would be interesting to allow players to trade/buy/sell assets outside of the game and perhaps establish a second economy outside of the game or have another strategy outside of the game. Ultimately though you're right, if the games that use assets die, they have limited to no value without a secondary purpose. With SoG, they realized this and are partnering with other developers to build games using the assets.  I chose not to use the SoG assets because the "theme" of them doesn't align with my game.

In short, they're conflicted internally because they're talking about making a coin, wait "blockchain" themselves. They were getting close last year to selling bitcoin directly, but then NY did it's license thing and they stopped.

An OS is just another tool in the box, you use what you need to when you need to. OS's come and go, if you emotionally attach yourself to just one way of doing something, you'll find yourself having a difficult time adapting to change in the future. I've found that over time, a zealot-like behavior towards a particular OS carries with it traits that makes individuals adverse to learning, collaboration, and open-mindedness. 
When it comes to cryptocurrency, you can easily build a false narrative that one OS is more secure than the other. A poorly configured linux system can be just as vulnerable as a windows system. I think we have all seen the posts on stackexchange where a user is trying to get something done and the first suggestion is to grant 755 or to stop firewalld.  User behavior drives the security model after the install is completed for whatever OS is being used.  I would suggest that a hardware wallet is the better option over both linux and windows for cryptocurrency.

I've been disappointed in shapeshift the last year or so. A dozen or more coins are "temporarily unavailable" where temporarily has been about a year. This was great for counterparty assets when they were alive on shapeshift. When you ask about the offline coins  in slack, you just get the same "oh it's maintenance" but it's not. I think they put the resources into prisim and just kind of gave up on shapeshift. I think Erik has a lot to offer, but I think he's distracted from shapeshift and left his toy in the yard where the weeds and mold are taking hold of it.
Glad to see that people have posted some alternatives here as well as in the article. I can say that the experience listed with Shapeshift in the article is right on point. I stopped using shapeshift because I can't get the coins/tokens that I need or want from them, so I moved on and went back to the exchanges.

Bitcoin would do to banking what the digital camera did to print photography (kodak, 24 hour printing, etc). By using bitcoin like cash, the efficacy of needing a bank to store your money and control the flow of it comes into question. There's a whole banking infrastructure setup to allow the banks to manipulate the system to make more and more money for themselves. A prime example would be lending money out that doesn't exist on their ledgers. Bitcoin can fundamentally change the banking platform and all the infrastructure that sits on top of it which banks have maximized for profits. Sitting at the top, are bank presidents. If Bitcoin reaches its potential, it would disrupt the entire banking industry and couple topple the system that sits on top of it. If you're heavily invested in that system (like banks are), Bitcoin is seen as a threat.

TLDR version: One developer is asking another developer for help. In the end, neither developer is satisfied as their points are unappreciated by one another.  
Machine_Ex98 has an application where he's hitting the limits of a web wallet api and Luke Jr chastises Machine_Ex98 for using a web wallet as a bad practice but doesn't explain to the other developer why it's a bad practice. The rest of the IRC participants try to offer advice or tell Machine_Ex98 he's in the wrong irc channel. In the end, both parties are frustrated while others are entertained.
Lessons learned: 
- Don't ask general questions in bitcoin-core-dev.
- If you use a web wallet, you likely don't control your private key and therefore don't have ownerships of your bitcoins. You may also open yourself up to increase risk of loss of bitcoins if you don't apply best practices for secure communication and key management.
- IRC continues to be a source of entertainment where technical savvy individuals hurl insults at each other in an effort to achieve glory and respect from others.

Get a trezor and use that. If you don't control your private keys, you don't control your bitcoins. Your coins aren't safe on the exchanges.
Here's a video to help you decide:
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:49:36
Both ledger and trezor have a two step confirmation process where the transaction isn't completed until you confirm on the device itself which shows the destination address on the hardware. This prevents you from sending coins to an injected address into a browser session. 
The attack vector you describe is valid for hardware wallets without a display and two-step confirmation process.  If you stick to the major hardware wallet manufacturers, you won't be susceptible to the attack you're talking about.

21 has not done a good job in showing a good example for this system. They allude to using it to sell digital works, like a screenplay or a business plan or rent time on a 3d printer.  It's like a screwdriver manufacturer telling you can use it to build a bicycle or fix a sign at an ice cream store and make quite a bit of money.
I know it's too soon to pass judgement without having one in hand and experimenting with it. However, I think they need to have a good working example of the intended use case. They're kind of saying it's a miner that won't mine very well, but hey, you can use it for all sorts of "cool" things.

I wonder how much Roger has actually deluded himself into his own scheme. You watch these shows like American Greed and you see the same kind of shenanigans. What's interesting is that they get carried away most of the times in their own delusions and forget about what the truth actually is. The echo chamber that surrounds him from the bcash supporters is beyond bizarre when he acts up. So take that kind of group cheer-leading with his ego and you can only imagine what that does. 
It's like that interview where he blows up and gives the middle finger,  it's like a window into his world where the truth and his internal view of the truth collide. I think that he see's what he says is the true reality of bitcoin and how his attacks are legitimate defenses in his head. I do think though at some point, either his inside circle and a small community of direct supporters will eventually turn on him, like what happened with GAW, or some government somewhere is going to take some action. The lawsuit might be the catalyst for this type of thing. You can sue Roger but you can't sue Satoshi (well, the real one anyway).

I think what would have been 10x better is if they made something useful and then pulled back the curtain and said, "Behold! this is all run by our new device!". However, instead, they've shown us a screwdriver and said, "Go build a scew factory and get rich!".

I like the game, but it has some challenges that it needs to overcome to make it appeal to more of a mass market not familiar with cryptocurrency. I've been showing the game to some card gamers as well as strategy gamers that I know to get more players involved. 
For some reason, they didn't find the game engaging or interesting enough to keep playing after about 10 minutes. I know for sure, they don't get the bitcoin-related topics in the game or artwork. Trying to explain it to non-crypto people is like that video where Bryant Gumbel is trying to understand what the @ is in email in the 90's.  
I think the game is too far of a leap to get people into Bitcoin. Maybe a future upgrade will make it less intimidating to the non-crypto public.

Sidechain - New buzzword for a mechanism/process to move a transaction/token/asset to a separate blockchain but still could potentially be moved back to the original chain if necessary. 
Shitchain - Someone who created their own blockchain in a closed source environment, a ponzi, sold out to the banks in an effort to retire early, or someone who created something exceptionally piss poor.

Even though there are a lot of tech savvy people behind these crypto services, a lot them don't really implement strong security models. I can't say for Gatecoin or not, who knows what measures they took.  I find that in general passwords get passed around in email or skype between staff, encryption for data at rest and in transit doesn't happen often, internal 2fa, separate privileged accounts, no change advisory board, etc. All it takes is a little malware on someone's workstation to keylog and it goes downhill fast. A lot of online processors would do well to implement PCI-based controls or NIST 800-171 controls to put in place some security best practices. In the end, nothing is hack-proof, but you at least make it as tough as possible to access the coins.

What? That's not true at all... I used to mine and would often give back to the community to help further bitcoin.  
Here's what I am saying:
Jane Doe buys a miner and wants to mine bitcoin so she can get bitcoins to buy some alpaca socks, donate some to tips, and support bitcoin. 
John Doe has 2000 miners doesn't give a shit about bitcoin and wants to mine them to get rich and retire in Spain before he turns 19. Uses his bitcoins to make scamcoins and run a ponzi.
John gets all the bitcoin block rewards and Jane gives up and switches to an altcoin. Mining has turned into an arms race that led to centralization in China because of ultra cheap power. Can anyone still solve a block? Yes, any miner (even a cpu) still has a remote chance in hell to solve a block, but because the difficulty is so high, it's near impossible.

Mining needs to change... The innovation of asic based mining with centralization to geographic locations where power is cheap has made the system go from altrustic to one of greed.

Even though bitaddress uses client-side javascript, it's probably still not a good idea to have a private key generated inside a browser due to plug-ins, malware, etc that could be watching for those things. I suppose you can disconnect from the internet before the key is generated.

I agree with you in that if the current solution works for most people, it's likely that will be the solution. There are efforts that I often read about where people are working on identity systems that would use the blockchain. In my opinion, identity is built upon a consensus of trust. Like it or not, trust is more often the appearance of something. More people are going to trust your passport and swisssign cert than a picture on bitfin with a handwritten note identifying a block in the blockchain. PKI doesn't always imply trust either, I can create my own PKI today, but that doesn't mean that anyone will trust it. Verisign has PKI, why do I trust verisign, because they're a company? Companies and governments can become corrupt, purchased, or fail. The blockchain is more resistant to those factors, but has other risks. I think it would be interesting to have an identity system based on a blockchain, but hardly anyone understands it to trust it yet. Likely anyone that creates an identity system on top of the blockchain would be centralized with a website and way to show/visualize the relationship, which has the same weaknesses as other systems. For now, I think these blockchain identity systems aren't very useful. Interesting, but not useful as of today.

Agreed :) All security has a trade off and the risk of using cloudflare is pretty minimal (imho). Cloudflare has a lot of basic security services to offer which help on the frontend, like a web application firewall that small startups couldn't normally afford. I would argue with OP that greater vulnerabilities likely exist internally at these companies or within the setup and configuration of systems and services. People always assume that companies are in their own datacenters that meet NIST 800-53 standards with dedicated teams of people. The reality is that many companies use cloud services or have a basic computer room with weak physical security and lack a balanced security architecture.  I empathize with OP's concern, but there are probably greater vulnerabilities just behind the curtain at said companies.

Like I said, nothing is hackproof. But the frameworks provide good guidance.  For example, I had a client that didn't encrypt backups and an employee made off with one of the backups, said client lost a large amount. Common sense to encrypt a backup? Yes, but a lot of IT departments need to be pressured into making changes that they often dismiss as "overreaching" or "too difficult". Like everything else, there's a balance to be struck. Believe it or not, some people have to be told to encrypt and change passwords.

The legality is being questioned now by the state that it's in. It doesn't matter if you're in the US or not.  Owners would be well advised to host the sites and live outside of the US. Players would be well advised to use a vpn then Tor, and use bitcoin. To avoid getting banned by an exchange like coinbase, just send your coins to a local wallet, then to a mixer, then to another wallet. Some casinos are using altcoins now, so you can go from coinbase to shapeshift.

My own horror story goes back to 2002 when I had a business that was featured in PC Gamer magazine. Orders went through the roof and my PayPal account was frozen for suspicious activity. So, I called them up and asked what the problem was and was told "you received too much money". My jaw hit the floor, I had to go through weeks and weeks of gathering documents and sending it in to them to prove who and what I was. In the end, they destroyed my business because they froze my account for so long it caused a ripple effect of being able to make and distribute product. Bitcoin is the ultimate revenge against PayPal and banking establishment. Long live math, long live Bitcoin.

I had been reading an article at lunch today about that. Is token voting a smart contract? I suppose... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I tell you what though, it was very interesting to read about!

I know for me, personally, this would be a game changer. Many times have I wanted to draw upon my bitcoins and use them for someone that won't directly take them.  While I agree that Bitcoin education is primary for retailers, this is a great launch pad over that "education hurdle".

I understand, there probably isn't enough here on this topic alone to warrant a story. However, I woke up this morning to see this topic on the front page of /Bitcoin and was surprised. I like how you said "as GAW goes", the fact that this is business as usual is interesting. Thanks for reading and replying though :)

That's true, I only meant there are best practices that apply. NIST and CCSS is probably the best of both worlds.

Who else is left besides Bitmain that actually ships a legitimate miner?
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:41:24
I built one about 6 months ago very cheap and stable for about $90. You can get a very inexpensive Windows-based thin client second hand on ebay for about $70, plug in a 64GB usb drive ($20) and store the block database on it. Power is under 65w, wireless. Download traffic is about 15gb and upload is about 180gb a month. About 20-35 avg. nodes were connected.

I'm wiling to take the loss, I understand. However, there are others out there still depositing. I'm just trying to get as far away and out as I can, weeks before this, people like me couldn't even login. The community is more important than my funds.

They had lots of plans to release many small miners, like putting them into light bulbs and things like that. I don't think they understood the mining difficulty well and how much it would rise over a year or two.  With mining at 6 exahashes per second now, the fantasy of lightbulb mining is no longer a reality. I think they're going to "pivot" soon into something else.

A hard lesson to learn. Never leave your coins on an exchange. Always remember, "Not your private keys, not your coins".

TBH... The video needs one more extreme close up on that serial number.

If your wallet.dat file is too old, it's going to be missing a bunch of change addresses and other key data. Hopefully you backed up your bitcoin data directory or made a more recent backup of your wallet.

Sounds like paypal 2.0... I don't like these centralized solutions that freeze funds, limit amounts, etc. Kind of in the opposite direction of what bitcoin was created for. I suppose people need this service though. Glad your hold was lifted though.

Hahahah..... and now for the gross sweat dance to ruin the rest of the party.

Ehhhh I don't know about this one... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Be very wary of the free scripts out there, there are some. You'll find them on Bitcointalk, however many of them from a couple of years ago had exploits/backdoors which led to thefts. 
Most run on html5, javascript, php, and mysql.  Consider security very seriously. 
Learn. Research. Repeat. I think that's the best advice I can give you.
Check the legality on where you live.
1. 
2. For instance, Bryan Micon was raided at gunpoint: 
3. AWS and Azure don't allow gambling. You need a host that allows gambling with a private virtual server that allows you to pick your own OS.
Basic Security:
Follow a standard: 
-Encrypt your whole disk (FIPS 140-2 or higher)
-Check your script for a backdoor, you're better off getting someone to code a new one for you from a trusted 
member in the community.
-Don't allow any-any rules for your firewall (inbound or outbound)
-Run Qualys scans on your server
-Implement multifactor auth for users and admin.
-Don't use weak ciphers or weak hashes for passwords (MD5, SHA1)
-Encrypt transit data to your encrypted wallet
-Use cold wallets with watch addresses where possible
-Make sure your domain and hosting registrar won't change data without verifying your identity.
-Use a web application firewall
-Prepare for DDoS
-Don't trust any general support staff you bring on to manage security

I'm sure it will be positive, but I think it will also be entertainment value based too. I expect to see an interview with a guy who's mining in his basement (at a loss no doubt, but that likely won't come up), the obligatory story on a guy who made a fortune, the person who lost a ton of money, and the "new" business people investing in it.  I'm sure we'll see a small blip on the altcoins as well, but probably mentioned in the context of trying to replicate the success of bitcoin. It will be interesting to watch, but sure half of us will cringe and disagree at the "mainstream" report of it.
