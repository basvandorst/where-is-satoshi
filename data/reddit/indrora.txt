Flash drives draw &lt;0.2A, so `0.2A*5 = 1W`
Reading the actual docs, running this guy hard is pretty cheap power-wise. According to DigiKey:




that's running Coremark, which stresses far beyond just SHA256 but doing hardware video and ethernet and friends.

How about I spend $0 and use what I have. I think [this]( will clarify my goals/intentions


I make bitcoins doing CPU mining. And, at my paltry rate, I'm doing uB$12.255/block and getting a block an hour.

Note, this is running with -O5 and lots of other little micro-optimizations.

I already *have* an IC. I have an ARM7 chip originally clocked at 8MHz, but which is perfectly happy running at 80.
Hell, I even have (thanks to new, updated versions of cpuminer) an optimized version of sha256 (was going to make gcc do my leg-work for me)
What I want to in the end do is build a board (open source, of course!) to drop one of these nasty-looking QFP144's on with the requisite USB hardware on each and make them daisy-chainable.

This is for fun.

GPUs can do massively parallel (thats their job) but FPGAs have their advantage in the fact that you can make them do things and not even have to consider what you're running elsewhere (they're essentially meat-grinders of the IC world, down there with all the Op-Amps and 555's of the world)
Given that, an FPGA can be very, very efficient at what it does. Sure you can have one part of the device dedicated to "handle my protocol" while the other is dedicated to "hash this data" with a few shared registers to share data, but it still comes down to "insert hash, receive nonce", which makes it all that more powerful. You line a bunch of these and you just feed them hashes, out come nonces.

I've seen the BFL boxes. Here's the thing -- if I wanted to do that kind of "big iron" kind of work, I'd throw $500 down as a student at one of the supercomputing clusters with the argument of "Cryptographic Studies" (which wouldn't be all that wrong) and eat 2 weeks of a few thousand CUDA processors on InfiniBand and churn out around 800GH/s.
If I'm not wrong, that'd be about the same scale as what DeepBit is running in its entirety, once you start summing OverClockers.ru and friends. I'd be doing it for much, much cheaper than any of them combined.
I'd be doing it for that cheap because I'm a "college student" and because the systems are there eating power and cooling either way. However, I don't want to do that because it would only prove to the entire world that I'm a massive dickhead. Sure, I'd hash ALL the data, but at the expense of probably eating all the coins being regularly found.
I want something that, in the end, costs me $20 or so that I can just stack one on the other and which uses maybe 5w of power. If I get 50KH/s out of it, I'll be happy.

My initial tests show me getting 1-2MH/s, so it wouldn't be unreasonable to say "Low-end, but efficient" considering this thing draws what a USB flash drive draws.

Great. /more/ protocols to handle.
Sounds like my best option, anyway.
