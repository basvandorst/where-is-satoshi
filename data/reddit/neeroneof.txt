Yeah, cash is a great choice, the two things I'd recommend you review first are the [cash guide]( and something on authenticating currency for wherever you live [this]( would be for the US, for example.  Also, you may want to make the ad visible only to high-volume, perfect rep people.

Probably the best option would be [LBC Mumbai]( particularly the "buy online."

Yeah, I think [p2p in Beijing]( would be the best bet.  Get the cash deposited in a couple hours.

I think that after you add money to the account it takes 3–5 business days to get it back.

You cannot buy bitcoins anonymously with a credit card since credit cards are linked to your name.  They have your name printed on them in raised lettering and you have to type it in when entering CC information online.

To get the money back into your bank account/onto your card takes 3–5 business days.

Yep, two best bets are [Coinbase]( (by linking a credit card) and [LocalBitcoins]( if you need them anonymously as well as instantly.

You're definitely not making enough trading then because good traders will be way ahead even if bitcoin goes to zero.  They practically don't care.  Hoping for a surge because you hold a lot is pointless.  The market doesn't care about you or what positions you have open.
