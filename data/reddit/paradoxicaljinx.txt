This is a soft grasp at the chance to centralize.

There's a deeper side to the dollar that actually has everything to do with gold and oil. It's true, we were, and still are the dominant currency of trade. But this was by design since we were loosing international currency domination to countries stockpiling gold. See, shortly after WWII the **Brenton Woods System** of international monetary policy was signed by 44 allied nations. And among many other monetary policies established then, it allowed for currencies to be pegged to gold prices for the intent of easing international trade. It worked, but France began to reduce its dollar holdings and started converting them to gold. Essentially stockpiling the real valuables and reducing US economic influence while building up its own. Nixon then put a halt to the US gold convertibility and turning our dollar into a fiat currency through what’s now referred to as **"Nixon Shock"** and the value of the dollar began to fall while other nations' currencies strengthened.  
  
Now here is where things get contentious by economists.  
  
Shortly after Nixon floated our dollar value, he chose to do something that has since secured US international economic domination. Nixon went to Saudi Arabia and negotiated a deal where the US would exchange military arms and protection if they would peg all of their future oil sales to the U.S. Dollar. This consequently lead to OPEC nations also adopting the US Dollar as base currency. Economists have since coined the term **Petrodollar**. And that was the economic check-mate, where the gold standard was thrown out for the oil standard and although currencies of today are considered fiat currencies, the US Dollar in essence is pegged to oil in perpetuity in a world addicted to oil in every way conceivable.  
  
**TL;DR:** The US dollar is evil and dominates the world economy through oil.
