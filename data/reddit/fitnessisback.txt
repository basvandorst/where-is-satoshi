Why ? When the pattern for ATH is always a few months after Btc halving, see you next year
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:53:45
Lol NAH, see you in 2020
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:07:19
3-7 months after halving we will see ATH

Wake me up next year 2 months after Bitcoin halving. Goodnight :))
@_date: 2019-07-15 08:19:23
This can go many different ways from here, 1 of them ways could be all the way down until a few months after Btc halving then ATH(late 2020)This could mean new lows that we should have seen already but we bounced hard from 3xxx (1800 overdue) . Other way could be we drop to 7xxx/5xxx and pick up in October and moon towards dec/jan
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:37:49
One more drop under 10k and we could sharply see 7xxx... If it can hold 9xxx-10xxx we will se moon october, otherwise i will stick to my opinion of moon after halving 2020.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:33:52
Get  all the Btc you can bellow 5k, we could see lower lows this year and ATH next year. Seen this rinse repeat form 2013. Normally ATH come after Btc halving 3-6 months  after. Good luck

I am Back to teach my Minions a thing or 2 :))) its been ages since i  posted  on Btc-e/wex happy to have created an account and speak with my people once again. Btc if you have noticed has performed excellent in times of a bear market for 8 months or so. I remember speaking about Btc in 2014 and what prices it will reach and how, same with Ltc from $3.50. I got called many names but look how far we have come ladies and gentlemen. Crypto is here to stay and those who listened to me become very RICH indeed. Dont listen to FUD be strong.  Hold and if anything keep buying. Personally i have been toping up for the last  2 months now. The next bull run we have you will see many many Noobs exiting the game because they bought december/jan at our highs and are feeling a little hard done by. My advise to the people is BUY more now prices are low instead of waiting to sell as soon as you see one spike lol . These people that sell on the first sign of a bull run will be holding there head in shame they will double miss the boat. HODL/BUY and by 2025 be your own status of Elite. well done to those who have achieved this already. Btc soon will be over 25k each and go for the 35-40k mark good luck Bitcoin world, if anyone has any question for Fitness feel free to ask I'm BACK

We are in re accumulation stage
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:07:37
I think on paper anything over 30k has to go through government officials for approval, but i doubt this system is working. I am seeing billions come to Cyprus from there. They buy themselves residency and that gives them access to Europe for business. Anyhow there is always a way to get around things i guess
@_date: 2019-10-20 04:40:38
Let the FUD kick in and lets see 5500 :) we have a long time until a new ATH. Kick back relax and keep accumulating

@_date: 2019-10-18 04:40:21
We are in re accumulation stage, we can still go to 5500 before halving and recover near it. It will be a slow and healthy climb all the way to a new ATH in 2022. Keep calm we have time
@_date: 2019-10-12 12:38:53

Bought  sold  Waiting for sub 6 now.  We will not see moon (ATH) until late 2021 early 2022. So pull up your pants and chill

I haven't been here that long, I've been trading Btc from 2103 on Btc-e anyway don't play poker is all i can [say.lol](
Price can go up from here to 9xxx or it can go down. More than likely in my OPINION we need to smash support 7800-7900 and test the next level support 5800. The question isn't if Btc can go 5800 or even 2500 its how will Alts survive Btc going 20% down from this level
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:31:55

we should see 5500 very soon, and then the clarity for 2019 will be apparent. My opinion no ATH until this time next year

@_date: 2019-10-03 15:31:14
Thats like saying do people think my house will be worth 5 mill one day?  Yes .  Btc will reach 100-140k by 2022. And over 1 mill by 2030. This question was asked a lot when Btc was 100, will it reach 1k . Will it reach 10k. Now its will it reach 100s . Firstly Don't ask people so you can invest. Do your own homework. And if its $ you want to make, you will make more bang for your buck if you buy alts this year when Btc hits say 5.5k alts will be oversold . so if you have say 35k to invest and wait 2.5 years this will equal to minimum 1 mill in alts . Easiest 30x you ever made. Goodnight and good luck

5500-5800 is the mark lets see. I am more interested in the next move already after we go to that level. The next 4-5 months is a cracking time to get it right Hoard and switch everything off until dec 2021 and watch the new ATH and exit nicely with a 30-50 x return in two years . Perfect right ?   it really is that simple . Good luck thats all my free advice and no more lol

On the way down people think its going to 0 on the way up people think its going to 100k lol reset levels always get reached and thats dropping to previous ATH, so for example 800-20k back to around the 800 mark would be normal before we go 30-40 x times again 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:46:38
Don't worry next year Btc will be 60k plus, Buy as much as you can from 1200-2500

You have the right idea, welcome to the Crypto world sir 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:34:58
Many ways to tell if you know the entire space and movement of money. And what's coming in the near future. Big boys will fly in soon they just want cheaper for now until next announcement of world adoption &lt; soon to come my guess is feb we will see the bull run start, i see market cap easily hitting 3 trill next round 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:35:19
And here comes Ravencoin, great news . 
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:02:25
My opinion to all ??? = 2018, These low prices might continue to be around up until mid to end of December. I think the lowest Btc can go is the range 1200-2000 big range but its close enough too reset Level. All coins are near or even dropped below reset level, reset level for me is reaching last round ATH. We are in a shake off period. All weak hands will announce themselves soon. Lower prices will attract all the Mainstream advancers due to Flood in 2019. This is there last chance to get on the train. New world will look like 90% electric, Artificial intelligence , and Blockchain Technology. &lt;---- This is what your investing in, its the future. The longer your in this game the richer you will become and the less likely you are to sell coins for fiat , but rather use your crypto in everyday life . Good luck all :)
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:27:02

@_date: 2018-11-29 07:49:37

@_date: 2018-11-25 11:27:42

You will never ever see $100 Btc lmao that shipped sailed m8, lowest we can go is 800 and even that's low. I think 1200-2500 is all in time

I guess your new to this space, TBH i have been dealing with peoples comments similar to yours from 2013 when Ltc was 1.60. we went through a crazy fast cycle to 48 and back down to $2 i was saying its too cheap buy for two years while accumulating myself.

Let me guess why 2020 so you can have time to buy more in 2019 ;) 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:20:44
Buy mid December, kick back and enjoy the ride to mars by March 
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:59:01
No m8 you are not hurting my feelings just my temper, i read through crap and see you love yourself to0 much and thrive on others with your sarcasm. So saying that your comments and opinions are invalid for me 100%
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:33:09
In simple terms been in this game for over 5 years and its in my blood now :)  Ask anyone on btc/wex who fitness is and they will answer you about my predictions. In the past 5 years probably been wrong twice this might be my third lol  Its all pretty much text book for now. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:39:44
Adoption is happening and don't try and be smart with me  m8 lol i am not your wife 
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:13:35
lol 
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:38:41
Personally i think its a Bull trap and we are going much lower soon 
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:29:01
Good luck buddy but be prepared for 1800-2500 then just buy another 2 :)
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:11:44
I can't really tell you what to do, but my opinion is that if you watched it go from say 18k to 3.5k its a little too close snd dangerous to selll now if your a noob on trading you could go into a spiral loss by feeling FUD and FOMO day to day and destroy your coin/coins. What i would suggest is leave it and if you see it go lower eg 1500-2500 buy more and wait 6 months to a year 
@_date: 2019-10-10 08:21:53
Great News
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:06:29
It will be the First Crypto bank that will have crypto reserves :) 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:42:20
All you need is one or two and you will be fine in the near future 
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:41:10
They all say the same thing lol  reddit has better fortune tellers :) 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:34:24
 Regardless what this guy says, we went to 8xx bill already. Next bull run will take us 3 x last high so say 2-3 bill and that wont even be mass adoption. If you have been in this game for a while or even have a good understanding on what the Crypto world is, and then compare it to the old systems you will soon realise that Crypto will be the Future. Mass adoption can easily take us 30T . And lets face it if we are going to Replace Fiat then this guy might be correct, because the planet does have 80T+ in circulation according to google :) 
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:17:23
I get your point, i think if we drop any further we will see btc dominance drop from here. Some Alts are close to being oversold so i think we will see btc going to usd and also some alts soon, this opinion is only form past experiences and might not occur. About when btc might Mo0on, well my opinion is wall street will take it on very soon this is a game they have been playing to get us to crash so they can finally come in HARD. This will allow TOM,DICK and HARRY to buy with no stress of wallets, trading sites and all Fud for these noobs. Also doors open legally for hedge funds. Once on wall street banks will also entertain it soon you will see the options on Btc in your Bank and ii mean really soon. Its about to get REAL
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:49:38
You have a lot to learn buddy, most if us have seen this 10 times over from 2010, Btc will be over 60k next year not 0 lmao 
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:48:25
Meh on this chart $700-$1000 looks very possible, scary but its another chance to get some if we go that low 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:38:55
No i don't see it as a problem, its healthy. People will only be happy when the banks and wall street adopt unfortunately. Its not losing value it was $70 in 2013 before pump lol so still in profit :) on a serious note when we get mass adoption it will be much more stable. At the moment its a free for all market and you can easily move it, soon tom dick and harry will have no influence and we will become stronger 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:15:55
They want it low to buy before ETF approved, another game incoming 
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:49:06
Great post, no paragraphs needed. 2019-2022 will be insane. My guess is Mid December will be the buy point, and next year we will see mass adoption starting. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:16:30
TBH because you asked so nicely i will not share my opinion to you or my knowledge. And i have only just come to Reddit, i have lived, breathed, ate and s**t Crypto for 6 years now i make my own judgements buddy. Good luck and i hope you do well. 
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:28:48
My opinion is that we will drop hard this year. I think we have seen the high for this year. Btc loves new ATH after Halving
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:24:04
called 7800 from 10k  look at Binance low 7801 :)  lines never lie
@_date: 2019-09-09 05:49:54
Not read the article but he beat Btc to falling new lows lol
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:01:25
Its called accumulation before its approved. My guess is one more huge drop before its approved . Next year is the year to approve it after they accumulate more in the next 5 months of Bearish market. Timing could not be better. Halving, insane amounts of hedge fund companies opening, L8 2020 is the time for a good recipe for new ATH.
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:47:11
Money will start flowing/moving more now, then we should see Btc take a huge drop followed by bleeding alts. I expect 10.5k-7.8k-and testing point 5.5k. Btc will moon after Halving and give  us a new ATH late 2020 or early 2021 . If i am wrong shoot me ;)
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:35:13
I tried for 6 years to get investors/mates to buy lolol they said some of the same shit in these comments, risky, bubble etc etc so they didn't buy  they didn't buy  they didn't even buy  they bought  lmao
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:49:20
Great Grab a mill or 2 and buy more Crypto
@_date: 2019-09-13 04:48:21
Great Question
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:22:33
Great idea.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:34:03
OK so now what are you saying ?
@_date: 2019-09-05 17:42:55
I bought @ 70-130 and still have them. It can never die in my eyes. But i do feel for those who buy the so called dip when it drops 800 bucks lol. Dips in my eyes are 50%-70%. not 5%, Btc is not like normal stocks, noobs will learn the hard way i guess.
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:40:41
Don't take her swimming, unless you want to divorce her. She will sink like the charts will soon .

@_date: 2019-09-09 05:53:14
Read my username then do your homework lmao give you a hint Btc-e. I do not have to prove myself to you i proved it to over 100k users from 2013 to 2017 :))  Anyway you sound very bitter i wonder why ? Sold al your btc @ 3.8k ? or you bought @ 18k ?
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:21:24
Not me, mines Red and it has a Bull on the front of the car... I only take it out on Bull runs :)
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:41:31
Who thinks this is the last Bull trap for 2019 ?
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:15:34
Lol , are you an old friend from Btc-e ?
@_date: 2019-09-26 04:17:40
When the real dip happens you need to have more pics, house, wife and kids
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:38:40
If it goes the way i ASSUME then you might have a good window from now to FEB 2020
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:29:39
Reported for what ? lol Altcoin ?  Are you retarded Btc-e was a trading platform. Now i know you are a noob
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:30:52
Good luck with that, Let the Games begin watch this space
@_date: 2018-11-29 07:50:01

@_date: 2019-09-24 19:35:34
Ok mate maybe you need to stop reading what your reading at least my crystal ball has been working for 6 years . And once again spot on .
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:13:31
Im not the one buying  at these levels I'm fine ty
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:54:11
Sounds good, nearly the same as mine although i see 100k-140k 2022 . New ATH generally is 500 days after halving
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:36:39
Better  late than never ;)
@_date: 2019-09-26 04:16:42
Lol see you down under
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:15:37
Sure Bitcoin is here to stay, its the best thing that ever happened for us, novice or not well said. Except for the fact that when Bitcoin is up people tend to forget that short term anything is possible. My opinion is that we will see some insane lows before we hit a new ATH. Late 2020 or 2021 will be the target for new ATH in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:43:32
Since 2013 until now GREAT!
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:33:42
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:34:33
All these city boy traders that told me Btc was a scam from 2013-2016 are now starting to get active. They will contact you on Insta and anyway possible for hedge funds Etc. Fk them off. 2020 you will see hedge funds for Btc and crypto spike  like no other year. Take control of your own money and crypto, Be smart and ruthless and we will all be just fine. Do not trust anyone but yourself when it comes to this fairly new Tech. Good luck everyone
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:29:44
Try and take your head out of your backside one day and see some light lol 
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:38:36
Probably 6 months after halving
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:43:35
Sell yes and buy back in Feb 2020, buy the parts this time next year
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:52:54
whats going to 0 ? Btc ? lmao ..... Btc in 2022 will be over 100k each mate so not one 0 but 100,000 &lt;5
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:50:27
When we halve it will be a new ATH 6-12 months after

Everything will close in Turkey soon, Turkey has no bearing in this world. Irrational government and people that want it all but will not compromise. Long live BTC, \*\*\*\* Turkey
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:46:21
lol This is when your a noob, holding is great but if you understand the cycle you would be trading to increase your portfolio, ALTS are great you can make a larger profit from alts than BTC, due to it getting oversold in a bear market gives you more x for your buck. And you only lose if you sell buddy. I have been in crypto form 2013 and never lost. Its near impossible to lose. I will see your holdings  :)
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:33:35
Oh yeah ? so was i right ? been in this game for 6 years now buddy i try and help when i can but people hate it oh well
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:16:28
First level 7800, if we don't bounce form that to 10k we will see 5500 within 2 months.
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:32:58
No guessing here buddy, calculated. The world hasn't even started with Btc yet. Put it this way invest ,35k form now to december in any of the top 20 alts and you will have 1 mill dollars in 2022. The easiest mill you can make. That my advice to you. Good luck
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:47:25
Im trying to help not insult but hey can't beat them join them GL

Although most are Depressed i personally think we are in the middle of Panic and anger and have a drop coming. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:02:48
Welcome to the Crypto world, well done for your purchase. What i am confused about is the point of entry for some. For example we saw it destroy the 5k support level and people are posting that they bought  , i mean once below 5k we know it will go much lower. My OPINION is the same with this level we are slightly above 100 bill do you not think its an easy drop to 85  bill Mcap? either way  its a blessing to have 10btc and well done. I hope you can do the same when its 1800-2500 and top up. Good luck all 
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:35:08
lol Great way to look at it that way it masks the loses 
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:25:51
Fasten your seatbelts and put your crash helmets on. Then if you survive BUY :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:37:24
Could be worse you could have had a portfolio worth 1 mill in Jan you didn't sell and now its worth 80k lol 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:22:19
Buy more hopefully 2500-1200
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:24:18
Its always good to think out of the box, well said 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:47:14
Rinse repeat 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:20:02
I am buying from 2500 down  to 1200, happy times ahead
