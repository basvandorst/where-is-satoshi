We sort of don't want that. It lends itself to the blacklist operator being able to fragment the network whenever they choose. At it's worst, it could be used to orchestrate massive finney-like attacks against the network.

No, they are, it's literally on the front of their website. 


@_date: 2015-03-13 09:52:20


Probably not. 


With this ongoing sybil attack, Chainalysis and whoever they sell their information to can. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:24:43
No, this is much more invasive. What blockchain.info is doing is incredibly antisocial, what Chainalysis is doing is abusing the network severely to satisfy their own ends. Their attack is causing real world damage to SPV clients.

Strawman? It's a simile. Describing one concept though another to ease understanding by an audience. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 02:57:55
There's risks to over eager banning. How do you know they're not saying anything because they're being malicious over there just not being anything to say? The attackers in this case will just "fix" it by saying junk back to the nodes, which isn't useful either. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:46:47
That's not really a solution to network scale attacks like this. All that will happen is that people set up malicious DarkWallet obelisk servers, if they haven't already. It's highly probable people already abuse the Electrum network to survey it's users too. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:08:06
That's harder than it sounds, straight blacklisting doesn't work because they are well funded enough to completely evade that sort of defense indefinitely. Actually determining a node is malicious or not is a very hard ask, if you accidentally ban too quickly you could end up causing a netsplit and consensus failure. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:46:17
There would be no point to their collection method if they weren't intending to discriminate based on IP address. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:42:36
Mycelium's custom node BQS flooded the network with invalid data not too long ago, the task isn't completely trivial. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 06:58:44
These fake nodes have been observed for quite a while now, around 5% of the total listening 'nodes' in the network are owned by this company. They do nothing but aggressively announce themselves to attract more people to connect to them and de-anonymise themselves. For all we know they own even more nodes than this, it's impossible to know how deeply they have sybil attacked the network. The main reason we know about this group is that they are particularly agressive and caused massive denial of service problems when Breadwallet and other SPV clients connected to them. 
After I became aware of them, I found that every node I owned had been ensnared at some point. It's unreasonable for most people to attempt to filter their connections on a large scale, as they are well funded they can easily rent large amounts of IP addresses to attack the network with. 


As they are targeting institutions, it's reasonable to assume people are buying the service and funding them further, but who? It's frankly quite scary that anyone thinks giving additional money to power wide scale attacks against the network is reasonable behavior. 
**EDIT**:[ Looks like the people behind this are from Mycelium and Kraken.com.]( 
**EDIT2**: If you are a system administrator or run a node, you can defend yourself for the moment by blocking:
* 5.9.115.0/24
* 46.105.210.0/24
* 2001:41d0:a:605c::/48
**EDIT3**: The 46.105.210.0/24 range is leased from OVH.net, who have an abuse reporting page available for people to voice complaints against people abusing their services. This is undeniably malicious, if you feel your node or wallet is being attacked by this group, this is another place where you could voice your concern. 
**EDIT5:** Looks like it's not directly related to Mycelium, they have blocked the service on their nodes and actively disapprove of it. Share a developer or adviser, but not ideals.

Monero is vulnerable to this sort of observation. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 11:49:25
Yes, it would be unwise to think that the p2p network is their only information source. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:54:36
Ah, right, not great with weasel words. Could take an even more uncharitable view and interpret "reveal" as "reveal publicly", in that they'll only sell them under the table rather than publish them.  
@_date: 2015-03-13 10:42:15
Elaborating a little, it's a type of attack against peer to peer networks where you pretend to be hundreds or thousands of people at once in order to gain massive leverage over the network. People in the network can't be proved to be unique or not unique, which is called the sybil problem. In this case, the company is pretending to be hundreds of nodes in order to be able to deanonymise as many people as possible. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:57:25
Being on multiple networks at once is totally possible, probably even desirable. You're right that there's a netsplit risk if nobody straddles both, though. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:56:02
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:32:20
You missed most of them, go full out and ban:
* 46.105.210.0/24
* 5.9.115.197/24
* 2001:41d0:a:605c::/48
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:20:17


That only blocks the nodes we are aware of due to their carelessness. I am aware of at least one more listening Bitcoin node owned by this company which nobody else has heard of yet, there's possibly tens or hundreds more given their funding. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 07:21:39
They use up 2000 listening sockets of the network. How is that not antisocial? 
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:40:40


It's a denial of service attack that successfully stopped Breadwallet from operating.

The people performing the sybil attack. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 07:27:06
Wonder if he knows that blockchain.infos nodes don't relay any transactions except for their own. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:59:32
It doesn't matter what's in the transactions, this sort of attack is designed to target those people who are making them. The attack is on a completely different level.
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:36:53
It's a company literally selling this information to other companies. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:24:06
See the link in the parent. They share ~~owners~~ developers, ~~or at least~~ and are in some way related to one another. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:17:49
Partially, it's only a strong defense if you are manually choosing all of your peers. Due to the way they are abusing address announcements any outgoing connection your node makes has a remarkably high chance of connecting to one of their sybil addresses. When you do, you potentially cause exposure of your transactions to them and they will attempt to gain as much information about you as possible. They're currently doing rather naive timing attacks against nodes, but there's every chance they will up their game and make them more agressive. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:55:42
If they were following the protocol they would be relaying transactions and not advertising an entire /24. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:43:26


They're using OVHs network to attack nodes in the Bitcoin network, it's absolutely their problem. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:59:05
The purpose of the company is to attempt to identify people and origins for the purposes of accepting their payment or not depending on who they are. This absolutely affects fungibility, as suddenly some bitcoin (the ones that can't be spent by people using this service) are worth less than others. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:53:59
Define sensitive.

Nope. That's why Sybil attacks are dangerous.

There is a single instance of a very minor altcoin related feature making it back to Bitcoin Core, and it had to be completely written before it make it there. They do not report bugs upstream, usually because they're using clones that are several years old. For example when DarkCoin "found" a upstream bug and triumphantly held it up against Bitcoin, they didn't realise that their fix was incomplete and was in Bitcoin Core months beforehand. 


Most altcoins do not patch even Bitcoin bugs (most are vulnerable to several severe bugs, not that anybody has noticed), so it's unlikely anybody will bother finding anything Bitcoin applicable. Even if they do find bugs it's probably more often the case that they are stale and already fixed upstream. 


That didn't need proving, it's quite obvious to anybody that it would happen. It's like shooting yourself in the foot and trying to justify that something valuable was gained by the experience beyond a bloody stump. More complicated proof of work systems just complicates development and adds NRE cost, it doesn't make it impossible or even undesirable. One can speculate that X11 was actually designed by someone with a shed full of 28nm FPGA as it's extremely suited for that task. 


Not really, just no altcoin has any scale worth mentioning where the ten fold increase in header size would actually be noticeable. Many altcoins are from such old forks that they don't support bloom filters for SPV clients, or they break SPV clients completely with their insane changes.  


There's no hostility in Bitcoin's changes towards altcoins, just nobody cares if the changes in Bitcoin Core will break any forks of it. They don't contribute at all, waste time with bugs that were fixed upstream years ago, and don't treat anybody with respect because they are being so edgy and innovative; it's a complete waste of valuable development time to find if your change breaks anything in one of hundreds of altcoins. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:59:26
I don't believe that. If they weren't there's no reason to do what they are doing otherwise. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:06:48


It's a very good indicator that you are incompetent. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 02:54:30
It's not considered a denial of service attack by the code, no. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:25:06
Yep, elaborating not arguing. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:26:33


It is designed exactly to be evil. Beyond being dragnet surveillance of the entire network, it's adversely affecting SPV clients like Breadwallet who were unable to sync when they hit these fake nodes. Anybody with knowledge to set up sybil nodes like this also knows exactly how it will adversely affect the network. Note that Bitcoin keeps working despite of this attack, but it's unbelievably shitty behavior to attack the network and sell it as a service.


Defending this is like swinging a bat at every bodies dogs as they go past and questioning why they weren't prepared for it. It's extremely difficult to defend against, it's not like we don't know that the dog will be injured if you smash it with a hunk of wood. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:03:36
For blockchain.info the two are essentially equivalent due to address reuse.
