Compare that to fiat currency, where 49% of all the worlds money is controlled by less than 0.7%. Mind = Blown

Do you know what its like to put your savings in a bank and have it lose 30% a year just on inflation? 
Do you know what its like to take a your local currency and meet a guy on the streets who has some USD and exchange with him at the black market rate then hold the cash under your bed?
Have you ever brought a backpack of USD to another country and sold them for a 30-40% premium?
Im going to guess NO to all of those.
Your argument looks at your happy world and says everything is fine.  It might not be bitcoin in the future, but cryptocurrency is the way 3rd world populations can start to have a fraction of control of their future. Its easy to compare a policesman's pension and waiting in line at Starbucks, because you have the luxury to those things. Clearly the tech is still developing, if you think that the first version of the internet is what we use today then you are crazy, if you think that the version of the dollar that we use today is the first version then you are crazy. The notion of a currency being backed doesnt matter at all, it is PURELY by public acceptance that makes a currency useable. A ~400 Billion USD Market Cap by the total Cryptomarket and its so easy to shoot down right? Lucky for you, you can short it instead of talk about it. Good luck!

I think you are confused about what coinbase does. They are a broker, brokers make money from trading regardless of the price.
