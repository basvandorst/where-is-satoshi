Quite frankly I would have to say ditto at this point.


Quality control in many (obviously not all) open source projects is superior. It has everything going for it, like transparency, inclusiveness, resilience, sustainability through dedication rather than being driven only by the incentive to come first to market. The list goes on.
Nobody said every project deserve to survive. That's how life is in the open source world and it strikes me as being very similar to what you would expect in a free market.
I know markets that no longer has this property intact.


Yep, that's basically how the Linux kernel and all the Linux distributions came to be. You contribute what you need, or what are are an expert on, and someone competent merges it if it stands the reviews and quality tests.
The opportunities are endless with this model.


That's not what happened to the OpenSSL stack if I remember correctly. A library used by pretty much everyone. You can't blame the open source community for not taking the front seat when it comes to security. I'm not convinced you have payed them anyway, so what are you complaining about?


My world is not only about you.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:19:39
Yeah, really.
Centralized solutions like circle and coinbase will leave bitcoin open to all kinds of attack and abuse by those who want's to control it above all else. The need for a trusted third party shows that they should go home and try again, and make it decentralized the next time.
Storing peoples keys is also a really bad idea, why would anyone even want that kind of responsibility? Because it's easier to implement?

I'm not sure what he doesn't understand, but you could argue that the very concept of laws requires some kind of higher power, or government.
I can easily see how a blockchain could be used to determine what the majority of people think should be a law, but what makes you follow those laws if you don't agree with them, or just don't want to?
Anarchy seems to make sense here. People will have to bargain for protection from their closest peers, and from other people they trust. On the other hand, greed, self-righteousness and ignorance is fundamental traits of the human nature, and those pulls us back towards centralization.
I doubt we will ever be able to avoid some kind of mix between centralization and decentralization, and there will probably always be friction between them.

Open Source doesn't mean not being paid. It does however mean that you are likely to receive a considerable amount of your income from funding and donations if you want to stay independent. A perfectly viable form of income in a free market.
That said, there is hundreds of thousands of developers out there, and the majority of them are unemployed (for some no good reason) or hold a job that doesn't suit their skills, so they spend time working for free now and then. Even the biggest companies in the industry takes advantage of this way to organize their projects.
Personally I do have some time to spend on open source projects.
Since I also have a job working on projects that isn't really important in the bigger picture, I also have money that I donate to projects that really matter.

Coinbase should have relocated from the start. Applying draconian regulations to bitcoin defeats its purpose. There is a reason why bitcoin requires a significant amount of computational power, bandwidth and confirmation delay. It is so that the currency can be run by its users based on consensus. Everything Coinbase is doing is working against those principles.

If you have to comply you did something wrong. Its as simple as that.
Bitcoin should never had been portrayed the way it has. People have been too eager and short sighted when promoting this thing.
Bitcoin is revolutionary, and asking for permission to start a revolution isn't going to work with the current corrupt establishment.
The only way bitcoin can get a fair foothold in my opinion is when people start using it small, all over the world.
People have the power, they just have to realize it.

I respect your attitude towards crypto-currencies, but I have to say I don't think governments is going to like them any more than Hollywood likes peer to peer file sharing, or China likes the internet. I do believe a war is coming, and I do believe crypto-currencies will grind its way towards victory.
Despite what many politicians and bureaucrats might think, people all over the world has not forgotten how they were butt f**** from two sides during the financial crisis, and in many ways, and places around the world, they still are.
In other words, I believe these currencies are that revolutionary, and nobody will get through this without a scratch.
That said, I'm not quite sure what you mean by intelligent regulation, could you elaborate on that?
Also, in order for a crypto-currency to be fully fungible, anonymization of coins is going to be necessary (see coinjoin),

I think the only good model for bitcoin is something similar to a crowdfunding platform.
There should be no central organization, only a dynamic, distributed rendezvous point accepting donations and votes for specific features and projects.
Something like Lighthouse that Mike Hearn is working on.
Trying to create a central organization to do the things you mention just doesn't scale, at least not world wide.
As an example, despite the fact that we pay Microsoft pretty massive amounts of money each year at work, support is non existent. Zip. Nada.
They show up once a year to count and collect licenses. That's it.
I would prefer to use a platform like Lighthouse to build a good set of tools and policies that local firms around the world can specialize in and use to provide services in their region. More akin to the Debian way.

As far as I can see nobody has "gotten it" yet. If bitcoin had to be backed by something else it wouldn't be very useful as a currency would it? 
I mean, it would certainly have all the same weaknesses that fiat has.
If bitcoin is backed up by something, it is consensus through a global distributed network of computers. A concept yet to be fully understood and appreciated by homo sapiens.
@_date: 2014-07-25 10:51:52
Bitcoins volatility is not an issue in the long run. The thing is that a national, isolated currency will be vulnerable in a global market where everyone else is using bitcoin.
There is a reason Ecuador is using US dollars as currency now. That way they avoid the hyper inflation that some other currencies has.
A separate currency could be stable, but I still don't see the point. Bitcoin is stronger if more countries use it. So what the heck are they thinking?

ATMs is just a buffer, they run out of money all the time.
In fact, I was going to withdraw something like $7000 the other day, the normal out-door ATMs in my country has a cap of $800 per week, so that was a no go. So I wen't to the closest bank and asked them to do it (this used to be possible) but they didn't do that any more. They did have a ATM inside the bank that had a cap of $4000 per week, so I managed to transfer money from my savings account to both my credit accounts (yes, I happen to have two) using their web based interface, and then use the inside ATM twice.
Stuff like this is just going to get harder and harder in the future

I have to disagree again.
Thinking big, in this case targeting governments and companies in emerging markets, doesn't capture the essence of what Bitcoin is all about. That's what everyone has been doing for the last milennium. Bitcoin on the other hand represents something new and different. In my opinion, we should expect Bitcoin to go much deeper than that, all the way down to the individual farmers and inventors of the world. That's where Bitcoin's potential is, among us, not above us.

The extreme nature of the NY BitLicense proposal is probably a good thing for bitcoin. Nobody is going to take it seriously, even in NY.

I hope Lighthouse comes along at some point. 
What I don't understand though is all the whining about lack of core developers for the bitcoin protocol. There is thousands of successful open source projects out there and now Bitcoin claims it can't find developers...
If there is one project that doesn't need to starve it must be Bitcoin.
I'm starting to believe the problem lies elsewhere, and the notion that new developers should be "professional" and "require payment" is ludicrous. I have never heard anything like that in a open source community, at least not from any successful ones.
We all knew the foundation and their secret handshaking was going to become a problem eventually (you don't need a degree to understand that) and my educated guess is we might be witnessing that right now.
With a situation like this, time is most likely working against us so the question becomes, are we better off moving to alternative full node implementations at this point?
Should funding and donations go to the other implementations as well?
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:34:16
I believe we have to start small and take our time. Trying to rush bitcoin into big money and an already existing establishment was a huge mistake.
Having a decentralized market map (like coinmap but decentralized) is the way to go.
Buying food directly from the farmer, selling used items on a decentralized online bazaar, etc.
Also, the US is not going to be the place where bitcoin will, or should, take off.
They have the world reserve currency and a reasonable high living standard. We should expect the US to be the last place to accept bitcoin, and not without their guns blazing trying to prevent it.

The idea that bitcoin has to "go big" and to be accepted by the few, already rich players in order to succeed is delutional.
What gives bitcoin potential is the exact opposite. Bitcoin can only really succeed if it grows from below. That was the whole point from the start, but it seems more and more people forget that, blinded by good old greed and an inherent submissive mentality towards authorities.
Getting anything close to reasonable conditions at the fiat/btc exchanges is already a lost cause, specially with US regulations in place. A flat tax at the excange is a lot better than those petty, archaic licenses.
Btw, we are all diehards, and now we are Samurai too.
@_date: 2014-10-04 07:21:46
Well said.
People who don't have any bitcoins, but wants to get started should get their hands dirty and start growing some food and selling it for bitcoin. Its the best way to get some coins and it's the best way to give bitcoin value.
Another good idea would be to get both coins and mining out of the cozy plutocracies and into the emerging markets and the third world countries, where it can continue to thrive.
And for goodness sake, don't undermine the whole thing by storing your coins somewhere else. Hold you own keys!

Its not you that commits money laundering crimes, its the banks, and governments has no other choice than to be part of it.

Decentralized systems has proven to be extremely robust. In fact, in a world that is already corrupt to the core, its the only way of sharing information that still holds up.
It won't solve corruption, or censorship, or economical growth (which is just a fancy word for inequality). But it has the ability to bypass all of those. Anyone who doesn't see that is either a moron or a fool dreaming of a world just like what the US used to be 50 years ago. If you haven't noticed, that train has already left.

It doesn't have any value. Its what you can trade it for that has value, or the markets it represents.
Why it is becoming a currency probably has to do with the lack of decent alternatives.
Fiat currencies has become so abused and manipulated that people are looking for better alternatives.

With 20+ years of programming, knowing 5+ languages, I would say start with C and math related to computing and cryptography.
Languages like Go and Python is perfectly fine too if you prefer those. They have everything you need.
The K&amp;R book (The C programming language) is free for download. The first half of that book is golden, the last half is outdated and not really worth the read anymore.
On the other hand, if you are more into the higher level of things, like making tools, mobile apps and browser addons, something like java and/or javascript might serve you better.
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:26:04
My two cents,
In general, for the most part the current protocol can not be changed without rendering every bitcoin invalid. If the developers of the software did such a change, miners and peers running full nodes would definitely refuse to upgrade, and someone would replace or remove that code change. 
Also note that there is already several alternative implementations for both mining and blockchain verification purposes, developed by independent developers.
There is however possible, theoretically, to do certain changes that will affect the valuation of coins, like increasing the max number of coins issued.
At the end of the day, if such changes was done on one of the implementations, it would be up to the miners and peers running full nodes to accept/reject the changes, and the choice made by the majority would win the race, so to speak.

Dud, this is the Bitcoin channel, I'm pretty sure nobody is going to suggest socialism around here :D
The reason I think decentralization is important is because politicians, regardless of where they come from, is all about accumulating power. If that wasn't the only thing they were interested in they wouldn't be in their positions in the first place. The amount of smearing and backroom dealing they have to go through makes sure of that.
Decentralization forces "power" back to the people, for better or for worse, and I think it is necessary in order to avoid communism, socialism, kleptocracies and what have you.

3. How the technology can be applied to other things, like voting, ownership etc.
4. How bitcoin, if globally accepted, could make funding of pointless wars much harder as governments would have to pledge ordinary people for funds.
5. What role bitcoin plays in countries that doesn't have a functional monetary system and currency, like Argentina, Cyprus, North Korea and a slew of others.

To me, the crooks that regulators and politicians should primarily focus on are those at Wall Street who orchestrated the finacial meltdown.
But, there is also small time crooks out there. People that has no other choice than to steal, or people who finds the current laws and regulations undigestable. In either case my answer is no, but if that is what it takes to keep Bitcoin a decentralized, non discriminant world currency, then yes.


Essentially yes. I see Bitcoin as a form of expression. The moment you have a coin, you are in business, so to speak. I consider it a free flowing medium like water or blood, and everyone has access to those.
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:21:04

As a side note, blockchain.info is trying to do something the other providers don't have the guts to even try. From a technical standpoint they insist on staying true to the vision we all came here for in the first place, but it is harder to do.

Ok fair enough.
Frankly, the best way to make money is to work hard and be smart, or to become a politician and get into shady deals and corruption.
Getting lucky with bitcoin is probably too late by now (I didn't get there in time either), but I can assure you that centralizing bitcoin and stifle it with draconian regulations is not going to work out in such a way that we all get rich in a hurry. in fact it will just undermine Bitcoin as a whole and make it into another enslaved vehicle for the already existing fiat currencies.
There is no reason currencies should not belong to the people. Governments should be happy to be relieved from such a burden, and they would be if they hadn't been involved in corruption and in securing the rigged markets.
That said, people have wasted their entire life trying to get rich on money. Don't go down that road, it's not worth it. The end goal is always to leave behind something better that what we had to begin with, wether we like it or not, and that is why we keep fighting.

Nobody ever said that bitcoin was ready for prime time. It has been said over and over that Bitcoin is a project under development. It has also been said that what happened at MtGox, blockchain, etc has nothing to do with the core bitcoin client.
The fault is in third party software solutions, trying to make bitcoin more user friendly.
Everyone who has been involved in software development knows how this works, and chances are that they have made sure that they have a backup of their private keys before transferring big amounts of coins.
Its a bitch, but that is where we are right now.
Personally I don't think blockchain has done anything on purpose (not so sure about MtGox), in the worst case they have an infiltrator among their developers trying to kill off projects that isn't BitLicense friendly.

@_date: 2014-06-30 01:11:29




A lot could be said about that, but my point here is that expecting work on Bitcoin to be paid and supported by a big Russian company or something is completely missing the concept. Bitcoin has a open source license for a reason. If some large company want's to support development that's fine, but it can't and should not be expected. Besides, there is other ways to fund projects these days. 
That said, I'm quite sure the reference implementation of Bitcoin won't make it very far if it doesn't deliver on transparency, availability and innovation for everyone, and the only model we know of that even takes that aspect into consideration is freedom source and open source licenses.
In essence, if Bitcoin needs companies to support it in order to survive, it has already failed.
The whole idea is just backwards. No offence but people who think that is going to solve anything should go spend their time on something else. Fortunately there is good alternatives so I'm not all that worried.
What I would like to know though is if the Bitcoin foundation are willing to support other bitcoin related projects as those I mentioned earlier for example.

I won't pretend to have any clever answers other than that my conclusions have been quite the opposite. Today, poor countries with broken currencies are desperately trying to get their hands on something more stable, typically dollars.
I also tend to think that there is no long term benefit in "kicking the can further down the road", quite the opposite, it can turn into a downward spiral, and I believe we have seen proof of exactly that lately.
Personally I'm pretty confident that society as a whole is better off taking its medicine as soon as possible.

The problem is that politicians, bankers, regulators, law enforcement and what have you are not up to the task. They are all incompetent, backstabbing liers. Thats exactly why they have those jobs in the first place.
Currencies should belong to the human race as a whole, and now we finally have one that works. Governments should be happy that they no longer need to baby sit their own fiat invention. They should also learn how to do their jobs without destroying privacy and stealing from other peoples pockets in the process.

I do care. Forget about the freedom of expression part and read the rest I said.
The whole point of bitcoin is decentralization. Its hard to really do anything with it without messing that up.
Someone stepping forward and saying that "Bitcoin is fine, I just have to take enough control over it to decide who gets to use it and who doesn't", is a excellent example of what will mess it up.
We don't need uncle Tom regulators to keep us safe. We really don't. If we look at the current world situation, poverty, war, inequality, dictatorships, fear, terror, etc. it is not peoples fault. Its the current elite establishment that created this situation, and they will do anything they can to keep it that way, or even make it worse.
So, don't invite these useless lying lackeys to seize control over Bitcoin, it won't end well.
@_date: 2014-08-05 01:47:14
No. They are as welcome as anyone else, but they are not particularly important compared to the millions of people bitcoin was made for. One thing I don't agree with is the notion that bitcoin needs big companies to survive.
Bitcoin is not a product and needs no funding, and no big company is going to make bitcoin suddenly happen. Anyone who thinks that has misunderstood the power and potential this technology has.
As far as I am concerned the emerging crony capitalism consisting of rigged markets, inflation based growth and dept issued by governments, central banks and their money printer, taken out of the pockets of our children, need not be involved. And the financial regulators' complete failure to do their job during and following the economic crisis tells me that they have nothing useful to add to our future.

Bitcoin does not have artificial inflation as we know how much there is of it, how much there will be and when.


That's kind of my point. If we use bitcoin as a reference (its a good one too since it is limited and transparent), it was the dollar that went up.
If we use the dollar as a reference, it was bitcoin that went down.
Basic math really, so it can be argued.

Actually, it can be argued that the valuation of a bitcoin can not fluctuate, so it has to be the dollar doing strange things.
Bitcoin doesn't have artificial inflation and we know how many there are in circulation any given time,  and how many there will be in the end.
I mean, who knows how much dollars are buried down in Mexico, or how many truckloads of dollars will be inserted into the economy tomorrow. Nobody has a clue, including Schiff.

You deleted your post, but I had some questions:
Finding a nonce gets harder when the required number of zero bytes at the start of the hash increases, right?
What determines the number of zeroes required has to do with how long it took before someone found a nonce the last time. &gt; 10 min, difficulty goes down. &lt; 10 min, difficulty goes up, right?
Where I get hazy is when it comes to the divide by 2 thing. Just hardcoding 4 years seems weak. It cant be right can it?
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:33:03
Its not really that far from what I meant. The difficulty (number of zeroes) will eventually deplete the number of "correct" answers. I guess you said it better.
By the way, if there is no limitation enforced by the algorithm, the hash size in particular, then I would say a lot of people have been fooled.
That pretty much makes bitcoin an inflationary currency where the inflation is controlled by the most hashing power, not majority. And steering towards centralization.
Kind of disappointing isn't it, or am I missing something?

You don't really own anything. The network may or may not allow you to pass bitcoins on to another address that may or may not be controlled by zero or more persons.

Actually I can understand their reaction. Just making a copy of their project and start manufacturing it cheap thanks to inhumanly low wages is a problem, not only for the open source community.
What it boils down to, in my opinion, is that in order to keep open source and open hardware going, we as consumers have to buy the original product even if it comes with a higher price.
That probably hurts anyone who actually thinks that competition is the answer to everything, but it actually makes some sense in a situation like this. As consumers we have to think about more than just the price when we buy a product. At least if we want open projects to survive.

The way I understand it, the governments we have today needs money and depth to be the same thing. Since there is no way to issue bitcoin as depth, governments can't use it. Not without letting their main source of power go, and the last time I checked, politicians doesn't do that. Ever.
Technically speaking, its perfectly possible for the Greek politicians to replace fiat with crypto, but they would probably end up as economically isolated as North Korea, trying to maintain their local market. Its not like they would be invited to any EU summits if they did that. Personally I would move there if they did, but in the bigger picture, it makes more sense to make the transfer from fiat to crypto slowly, without any assistance from those prowling for an opportunity to control and enslave the masses.

Its not that sneaky either. Its straight to the point really. If Greece, or any other country that isn't already burning on fumes adopts bitcoin over night, it will hurt, and probably continue to hurt until others do the same.
Bitcoin has no other way to grow than through peoples acceptance since it has no central point of control.
However, the Greek government, and other governments as well, should *invest* in crypto currencies, making sure they don't end up holding nothing on behalf of their population.
In all fairness, I think it makes more sense to talk about how bitcoin needs a nation, rather than a nation needing bitcoin.
Again because it has to start at the bottom. It can't be applied on top of centralized, fiat based systems.
