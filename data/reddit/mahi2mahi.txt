Is that really worth it or would one be better off simply buying BTC?

People are different. Some continuously make bad decisions, are lazy and undisciplined, don't plan far into the future, etc. Others develop opposite traits that will lead them to accumulate higher amounts of wealth like it happens with any other power resource.  
You can give a group people $1 million each, after a few years some of them will be in debt while others will have multiplied the initial sum.

Don't worry it'll get confirmed eventually.

I think it's difficult to determine because: 1. users can have multiple addresses 2. exchange addresses that actually hold the balance for many users.  
If someone well connected and resourceful were to get this data from all major exchanges, then you could get a real picture of the wealth distribution. It would certainly be interesting.

What I hate most is that they don't even show you a simple Bitcoin address on their pay invoice. So you need to have cell phone wallet to scan the QR or a wallet compatible with their payment url. I just want to have a simple BTC address, no fancy extras.

See it is confirmed already! In the future, best to wait for 1 confirmation just to be 100% safe
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:28:02
Perhaps because a lot of the volume is fake

This guy has been wrong about more or less everything.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:24:28
I have the same feeling, this is just too inorganic to be believable and sustainable.

It's a trick question. If 3 BTC equal  £10.80 then screw those lousy 7 BTC, it's time to go all in!

This is a snake. Run before it's too late, run!

They use blockchain analytics products that apparently have identified the gambling website you were using. Typically they check back a few transactions, so sending through a couple addresses as hops in between before depositing it to an exchange could already be enough, see for instance Samourai Wallet's ricochet function that makes this easy.
What you can further do is to use Wasabi Wallet to coinjoin your BTC with other people's BTC so there will be no way to say where your BTC came from.

It's the snow that was stuck under his shoes. Look at the shoe print next to it, it is also melted.

I knew it! After Finney that was obviously the most likely candidate.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:51:42
That's quite possible. Guess we'll find out soon.
@_date: 2019-01-12 21:32:09
This and wasabi wallet

His stash is worth A LOT more than $18 million

I had the exact same thoughts haha  
'Ok I checked, it's legit, but I am still not clicking on anything in this email'

It is a statistical process and the protocol adjusts to these deviations, aiming for 1 block every 10 minutes. So if during a certain timeframe not enough blocks are found then the difficulty will be lowered so that miners will find blocks faster again and vice versa.
Miners are all competing to generate the next block, but what they do is basically just blind guessing for a fitting solution. If one finds the solution he can publish the newest block. So sometimes multiple blocks will be found in short succession and other times they might not find a block for 1 hour.

Are they even operational yet? Crazy that they are already doing acquisitions, anyone know how well they are funded? They must have some serious backing

Yep this is the way. Don't make yourself a target. Money always makes people jealous and greedy, even those close to you who may not show it. So the best approach is to just never mention your holdings at all.
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:24:54
Sure buddy, we believe you.
@_date: 2019-01-19 15:45:46
We believe this to most likely be a Binance issue. In this case we would suggest you contact their support!
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:31:05
To really prevent these cases you would have to inform all potential criminals out here beforehand that your coins are timelocked. Otherwise they will simply believe you don't want to give them your coins and possibly harm you even more
