I am wary of government power. I am far more concerned with corporate power over which I hold no reins.

The bitcoins themselves are an asset. There is _also_ a liability for them to the creditors.
Unfortunately, (by definition) in a bankruptcy there are not enough assets to cover all liabilities.

It already exists. They are called Home Owner's Associations.
They're usually terrible. Who wants a fourth level of government?

Calling it Free Market is likely to cause far more problems, though, as that tends to be associated with far right wing politics. If it is intended to appeal more widely, that is a poor choice.

One could offer the counterpoint that many of the advocates of anarchy are unwilling to concede, even for a moment, that it never has.

Except that you aren't battered in any way. Feel free to start your own state, if that's what you want to do.

The majority certainly do care very much about their own comfort. They're simply not much willing to risk it for others.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:09:43
That's rather naïve.

Dark Market would be a slightly more neutral term for what it is: a black market.

That is rather trivial for the warlord to overcome. They need only pose a greater risk to the lives and property of those who refuse. Conscription is hardly a novel approach.


It costs more to create than to destroy. Any rival "protection" agency would need the ability to destroy the rogue outright. Remember that the rogue would not, necessarily, have to fight the other protection agencies. Simply killing their customers would do, _pour encourager les autres_.

The other layers would not allow you to replace them.
There's no reason HOAs could not be wider in scope, except that no one wants them to be.

It brings to mind a gaggle of Mormons in pressed white short sleeve dress shirts and ties bicycling about a neighbourhood asking if people have heard the good news about meth.

Is it, though? It seems more like the rational self-interest libertarians like to blather on about.

No right is absolute.

You seem to be missing the point of incorporating. If you could be held to unlimited liability, who would ever undertake a business venture of any significant risk?
Mt. Gox failed. Its principles are moving on with their lives. That is exactly how the system is supposed to work.

You're being a bit extreme to lay claim to setting "common ground." Especially when you label taxation that is part of a social contract you agreed to, and can escape at any time you like as "theft." If you don't like the price of citizenship in your current state, feel free to avail yourself of the free market and select another.

I'm not sure how you imagine said child wouldn't starve without alcoholic mommy or a replacement. Pull herself up by her bootstraps? Chimney sweepery?
@_date: 2014-07-05 01:22:52
If you really feel that way, then relinquish your citizenship. Libertarians claim to feel personal responsibility and contracts are of primary importance; put up or shut up.

There are no inalienable rights. Physics does not care one whit what you think you're entitled to. Many of those you list are logically impossible, as the contradict each other or even themselves.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:08:16
You agreed to pay your taxes, and to the enforcement mechanisms. If you no longer wish to do so, relinquish your citizenship.

It's still a closed circle; if none of those buyers or vendors are in your web of trust, none of that matters.

Which one of the Koch brothers would you be? I rather think they're able to buy too much influence right now.
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:47:44
So how do you propose to control corporate power, then?
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:02:51
I think you'd find otherwise if you actually tried.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:12:24
I did. Your mistake is that you are rather naïve about human behaviour. Governments are not at all necessary for economic conglomerates. Even ancaps take that as a given.
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:40:18
Precisely; _try_. I don't imagine you'll be much in favour of respecting the right to life of someone currently attempting to kill you, for example, nor the right to another's products of their labour if you are starving.

Fake users who do nothing but buy from one vender would be rather easy to prune automatically.
