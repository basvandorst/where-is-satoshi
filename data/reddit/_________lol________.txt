There is a LOT of money to be made providing bitcoin exchange services, however it is VERY expensive and time-consuming to set that up, due to the regulations. This keeps the merchant services immature. If it were just a matter of developing the technology, and not having to deal with the government, we would already have a much more robust business environment. Writing code is easy. If you want it done really fast and really well, you throw more money at it in the form of more and better programmers. You can't just throw more money at the government and get up and running fast, unless you have the MOST money and existing relationships with regulatory agencies and politicians.

You can encrypt the private key with BIP38. But you don't always want to do that, since the person most likely to find this might be your relative after you die (if it's stored in a safe deposit box, for example), and they might not be able to find your BIP38 password.

Everyone here thinks *what if?*
I first saw Bitcoin when it was at 40 cents. When Bitcoin was about $1, I bought about 50. Traded a few times and made a few USD off of the deal. Sold all of them at $12. Bought back in at $30. Sold since. Bought since. All in all, I've made about $250 in USD at the current price. But if I had kept my 50, and sold them today, I'd have $7,000. Doesn't bother me one bit.
You don't feel terrible that you didn't win the $100,000,000 MegaMillions lottery last time you bought a ticket. You didn't win the early-adopter lottery either; don't feel bad about that.
If you believe Bitcoin has promise, buy some now. If not, don't. Don't buy more than you can afford to lose, but don't buy so little you'll be mad at yourself again that you didn't buy when you had a chance.

And after it happened to a few people, others would realize how foolish it was not to subscribe to fire protection services or have some other way of preventing fires.


People die in fires under the current system. I'd wager that having multiple competing fire departments vying for customers' dollars would *reduce* the number of fatalities and fires. Why? Because they would compete to offer fastest response times, best firefighting equipment, and lowest prices. As it is, there's just one provider. While they certainly aren't going to purposely drive slower to get to a fire, what they *don't* have is the incentive to innovate new ways to protect clients. Also, the "free" public fire services we have today disincentivizes on-site fire suppression such as sprinkler systems: people don't get a discount on public fire protection services (because it's already $0) for having a sprinkler system or fireproof doors and walls.


There are some of us who believe that a stateless society (or a very minimal government) would have far fewer problems than our current system, which tends to institutionalize problems (poverty, poor education, drug abuse, expensive healthcare) rather than solve them. And for the few problems it does solve, there are typically plenty of unintended consequences that offset any perceived benefits.

But you need the cash to move it to back into the first exchange to benefit from the arbitrage, unless you want to do it just once.

Would you consider publishing some aggregated stats on how many of your account holders are above or below water?

Asking a merchant to keep all of their bitcoin receipts in bitcoin is retarded. In most (all?) cases, they can't buy their merchandise from their wholesalers in bitcoin, and even if they could, it would be stupid to keep a large portion of their assets in a young and volatile currency. For merchants, bitcoin is primarily a payment system, not a currency. As adoption grows, it will become a more proper currency.

Just because the new money is being offset by things that would naturally lower prices (such as improvements in efficiency, new resources being tapped, etc.) doesn't mean that the new money's inflationary effects aren't harmful. If the money supply is being expanded by 6% a year, but the economy is lowering prices in real terms by 4% a year, then inflation looks like it's only 2%. The new money goes to the government, the banks, and government contractors first, meaning they get to spend it before the prices have had a chance to rise in response.
Also, the banks are sitting on much of the new money, so even though the Fed is dumping it into the economy, it's not yet had much effect. Mostly it's just a way for the banks to get rid of their worthless assets.

Mining can also be done when electricity is cheapest. Turn the rigs on at night, and off during the day.

Price deflation is a symptom of either a decrease in the monetary supply or an increase in the demand for the existing monetary supply. Inflation or deflation isn't really a big deal as long as it's predictable.
Right now, during the adoption phase, bitcoin cannot be used as a unit of account because of its volatility. Eventually things will settle down and things can be reliably priced in bitcoins.

Yes. Long term, I think it's a sound investment, but a lot depends on how the world's governments and central banks start treating it once they realize that their monopoly on money is being threatened. Can they shut it down? No, but they can exert a huge downward pressure on the price by making it expensive or illegal to use.
As far as being a gamble, buying in that much when the price is at an all time high is definitely risky. Markets bounce up and down all the time.

In the "real world", you're used to using credit (or debit) cards and cash. Online, up to this point your only option has been credit cards (or bank transfers for some things). Bitcoin is internet-enabled cash. From your perspective, it's like any other foreign currency. If you want to buy some, you'll have to go to someone that's selling it (at a place called an exchange) for some of the money that you have. You trade your dollars for their pesos or bitcoins or yen.
With bitcoin, the vast majority of exchanges are online. Mt.Gox is the largest, but there's also bitfloor, bitinstant, bitstamp, and others. It takes a while to get your dollars into one of the exchanges (some longer than others) due to banking regulations and the general slowness of the old system, but once you have money in your account on the exchange, you can buy and sell bitcoins and other currencies as often as you wish, and instantly. Getting your money back out of the exchange in any currency but bitcoin will also take a while.

You're used to using credit cards when you buy something online, but there's obviously no way to send physical cash over the internet. Bitcoin is a digital version of physical cash, and because every transaction is publicly visible and publicly accounted for, it works without the involvement of any bank (including the high transaction fees they charge).

Those bulbs were also extremely dim. If we wanted extremely dim bulbs, we could also make one that would last for 100 years.
Durability is not something you want in many products. For example, many of the early computers were built like tanks: 50+ pounds, steel case, etc. They also cost a *lot*, in part due to this overengineering. You want something that will last you about 5 years, at which point you'll want to upgrade to some newer technology. And with many other products, it's cheaper to make (and buy) ten of something that will last 2 years each than one of something that will last 20 years. The main concern then is generation of waste material, but with advances in recycling technology (especially as the value of recyclable resources increases), this becomes less of a problem over time.

I just added mine over there. Copypaste:
**Bitcoin is functionally very similar to cash, but it's digital instead of paper. We obviously can't send paper over the internet, so instead we send the serial numbers.** (Note: not the serial numbers from actual dollars or euros, etc., but newly created serial numbers)
This raises the problem that we could just keep sending out the same serial number to everyone we wanted to buy from, effectively spending the same money more than once. To solve this problem, bitcoin takes the unique approach of recording every single transaction, no matter how small, in the cloud in a shared file that everyone can see. Now, when Harry pays Sally, everyone knows that that cash now belongs to Sally, so if Harry tries to send out that same serial number again you should ignore Harry and tell him he's an idiot. This shared file (a public ledger called the "blockchain") is the meat of the bitcoin network. Everyone who reads or writes to this file is part of the bitcoin network too.
There are also a lot of rules that every device connected to the bitcoin network agrees to follow. (If they don't, the rest of the network will assume that computer is cheating and ignore anything it tries to add to the shared file.) These rules include things like how (and how often) new serial numbers are created, and ways to prevent people from cheating the network. People who use bitcoins don't need to know any of these rules, just like you don't need to know how the credit card network actually works in order to use your credit card.
Bitcoin got much of its initial value by being a big FU to the existing financial system, which is controlled by governments and moneyed interests. Those who liked that message liked the independence from the financial system that Bitcoin could potentially offer. To others, it was just an interesting technology experiment.
Could it really work, both as real money that people were willing to trade real products and services for, and as an unhackable way to permanently pass a serial number from one person to another in plain sight? Lots of other attempts at a virtual currency have been made before and failed on one or both counts. So far, bitcoin has succeeded on both.

Same for people who live in the U.S. when they travel to almost any other country and have to deal with metric.

There are some others with pretty decent traffic, like and and of course I think it's important to grow these other subs so that people interested in certain aspects of bitcoin can find exactly the community they're looking for, and a multi-reddit is a great method for both subreddit discovery and content discovery in subs you wouldn't normally visit.

I don't think that your site specifically looks scammy, just amateurish. Color choices, fonts, button appearance, the amount of text on each page, ".html" in the URLs, etc. I'm guessing that the person in charge of your site is either you or someone related to you, or maybe someone in your company who has another job and does the site as a secondary duty.
Since bitcoin is more like cash than a credit card, I as a potential buyer have no protections against scammers that a credit card or Paypal buyer has. This raises the bar of trust and reputation required before people are willing to buy. Your site has to look like a modern ecommerce site instead of what's essentially a brochure. I can't tell you "specifically" or "exactly" because it's like we're looking at a 1972 El Camino and asking "what specifically don't you find modern and professional about this car?" Yes, it has wheels, windows, and doors, but everything about it is just old.

My favorite thing about bitcoin is the potential to destroy the global banking cartel's grip on real wealth, which could result in an unprecedented growth of the world economy.
Least favorite thing is that it relies heavily on technology to work, so (for the time being) it is a very difficult topic for many people to wrap their minds around, and it is unattainable for those without access to the necessary technology and internet connection.

You know, post and shipping companies could issue free stamps with unique bitcoin addresses on them in the form of a QR code. You use a single stamp, scan it and send the exact amount of bitcoin required for mailing your letter or package to that address. When the shipper receives the package, they scan the stamp and check that the address has sufficient funds. The shipper would then use their private key to transfer those funds to one of their main wallets.

Inflation increases the number of monetary units circulating in the economy. This decreases each unit's purchasing power. In other words, it lowers the value of each unit. We are arguing over definitions, which means that we will get nowhere.


Rather, it distorts the market's knowledge of savings and capital accumulation, so money tends to be spent wastefully. Inflation discourages savings, and savings are the basis for capital investments.

"Bitcoin is essentially cash on the internet. It's a way to conduct business without having the credit card companies and banks as an intermediary whenever you trade your money for someone else's goods or services. That reduces transaction fees by ten times or more, and it can be quite anonymous. Also, since no government has issued this currency, and there are unbreakable rules built into the creation and use of this currency, no government or other entity can change the rules of the game in the middle of the game."

They don't have to overthrow them. There's no reason to if there aren't enough profits in that sector, because the market dominators are already providing a sufficiently satisfactory good or service at such a low margin. Instead, investors come up with other things that people find worth paying for, since they can earn a better profit elsewhere. Also, eBay and Craigslist have only really been around for what, 15 years? For most of that time they've had plenty of competition but managed to rise above them.

Of course, but if they see that all suitable harbors are becoming too unfriendly, at that point they would begin to make it full-time seaworthy. It just depends whether it's cheaper to do that or submit to the local authority. But since they can move, the local authorities may compete with one another to be most friendly, since they would presumably benefit economically from having a large additional population as guests in their harbor. Seasteaders would come ashore and spend money on things.

Transaction fees are near zero with bitcoin, and no one can freeze your bitcoin account* as Paypal often does.
Bitcoin is a hybrid currency *and* payment network, whereas Paypal is just a payment network that deals in other currencies.
*edit: I should clarify that if you keep your bitcoins with an online service or exchange, they very well could freeze your account.

Yes, but at this point you have to be tech-savvy enough to know how to secure it and make backups, assuming you have a significant amount of money. You wouldn't carry around a wallet with $5,000 in it, and you shouldn't keep a wallet with $5,000 worth of bitcoins unsecured on your computer.

No, they sell right away. Your account on an exchange has a BTC balance and a USD balance. If you have 1 BTC and sell at $1000, your BTC balance goes from 1 to 0 and your USD balance goes from 0 to 1000. However, when you actually want that $1000 to show up in your bank account, instead of just as numbers on MtGox, THAT is when you have the long wait.

It wouldn't really be a problem anyway, because unless your mortgage is fully paid off, your bank probably isn't going to allow you to *not* have a subscription to a fire protection service (FPS), just as they require you to have homeowners insurance. As long as they have a stake in your asset, they're not going to want that asset destroyed. And after your mortgage is paid, you aren't going to be able to get (reasonably priced) homeowners insurance without FPS.


No, there won't be multiple FPS in every area, but under the current system, there's only one in almost every area. (Although neighboring fire districts will also respond to fires too, depending on the severity and distance.) So opening this service up to the market would be a net positive.


Since public FPS is paid for with tax dollars rather than market, there's  a good chance that we're getting low quality service for a high price. With private FPS, we could get the same quality service for less money.


A lot of them are volunteers already.


Keep in mind that we're already paying for these services, we just have virtually no say in what we get for our money. Also, "premium" FPS companies would have the capital to drive innovations, which would eventually trickle down to the cheaper FPS, just as luxury car options a decade ago are now available in much cheaper cars.


Health care was much cheaper before the government started getting heavily involved in it in the 1960s. In a free market, high profits are a signal flare that attract new investors and vendors; the more people selling the service, the faster prices come down. However, when the big players in an industry use the government's power to harm their competition (through regulations, special tax treatment, etc.), then the high profits get locked in for them.


And as I said above, the wealthy people paying for excellent health care are driving money into R&amp;D which helps the poor people down the road. Same thing with other industries, such as tech: people willing to pay $500 for a DVD player or new phone when it's first released are the ones making the $20 DVD player and phone a possibility today.


The current system is extremely far from a free market, and I believe that's what's destroying the middle class. Those with political clout are crushing those without it so that advancement by building a better, cheaper product is no longer possible for many people.


Well, since we're in BTC is one way to erode the state's stranglehold on power.
You see how hard it is to fix local government, now imagine state or federal government problems.

The article was saying that Bitcoin's original value (much less than 1¢ each) was derived from the desire to make a statement against The Man, but the quality of the bitcoin architecture (especially its ability to bypass the banking system and/or government-controlled currencies) has given it more value since that time.

But it really isn't possible. There just isn't enough profit potential in some sectors to justify investors' dollars being put into that sector. Why invest in something where the risks are high and the potential profit percentage is lower than everywhere else? There's not a big market for pinball machines right now. Do the remaining pinball companies around the world have a "monopoly" over their local markets? Sure they do, but that's not a bad thing, and it would be wasteful and economically harmful for the government to try to step in and make the sector "more competitive" in some way.

When the govt issues more currency, that's monetary inflation. The supply of currency in circulation increases. Agreed?
I say that monetary inflation causes existing currency to have lower purchasing power, which means that prices rise in nominal terms (price inflation). A thousand dollars before inflation buys me a thousand candy bars, and a thousand dollars after inflation buys me only 995 candy bars. As a result of the inflation, my thousand dollars have a lower value.
