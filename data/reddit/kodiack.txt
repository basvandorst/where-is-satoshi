It sure is. It's practically extortion to renounce as well, since you have to jump through hoops to ensure tax compliance and cough up $2350 USD.
I'm quite economically disadvantaged compared to my peers solely because of my cursed citizenship. The cost of compliance - both monetary and time - effectively works as a sizable enough pay cut.

I'm a US citizen that's a resident of New Zealand. Dealing with FATCA, FBARs, and general US tax compliance is literally the most stressful thing that I deal with in my life. It's painful and I feel abused as an American expat.
Several financial services want nothing to do with me either because of the absurd reporting requirements. I had to take a pretty massive cut by selling on LocalBitcoins in December since the local NZ exchanges accepted citizens of every country *except* for America.
I'm deeply considering renouncing my US citizenship in a few years once I become an NZ citizen. The opportunity cost of being an American abroad is far too much to bear.

There's a difference between "not being loyal" and spreading completely false information. There are several valid criticisms about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is very difficult for the average person to get into right now, and those familiar with stocks would be uncomfortable with the idea of needing to invest so much to get into the market not knowing that they can invest as much as they please. Bitcoin can also have fairly poor confirmation times and the network isn't currently capable of scaling as high as it needs to if growth continues. Ultimately, though, most (but not all) concerns can be addressed by people reading and learning more about the protocol.
The problem I have with some of the excerpts from the articles and several of the comments is that they overall felt quite hostile and were spreading complete misinformation. I had the impression that many of these people had a bone to pick.

I've been curious about Bitcoin since early-to-mid 2011 and wasn't quite sure where it would go. It was really exciting being able to use Gyft to get gift cards for various retailers, although they're more of a middleman than anything else.
I really got excited this last weekend, though, when I crawled out of my cave and finally purchased a (cheap-o) Samsung Y "smartphone" with a forward-facing camera. I've always been fairly generous with my Bitcoins and donated here and there, but being able to do it by simply scanning a QR code was amazing and oh-so-fast! For anyone that cares, [Media Hint]( is what I just recently donated to since it allows me to continue to easily watch Netflix after my move to New Zealand.

If we could get better ADSL (or VDSL!) service here, Slingshot wouldn't have been so bad. Once UFB (fibre-to-the-home) gets rolled out where I'm at, I'll probably switch back. I'm within reasonable walking distance to Wellington's CBD and should have UFB within a year or two.
Slingshot seems like a fairly decent ISP overall. They were one of the few ISPs to offer truly unlimited plans until competition grew fierce in that market over the last 3-6 months.

I personally block ads wherever possible, even on - especially on - mobile devices. Ads have way too many issues. To name a few, ads:
* Frequently link to malware or link to phishing sites
* Do not respect your privacy
* Suck up mobile device data
* Chew through mobile device battery
* Hinder performance, especially when auto-reloading
* Make pages ugly and distracting, especially when animated
* Waste time when they're forcefully shown prior to loading content
Blocking ads is crucial to ensuring a safe, fast, and enjoyable experience. The entire internet ad industry is a sham these days, and I only hope that an idea as novel as Bitcoin can come along to disrupt it.

I really, *really* regret my "purchase" back in very early February. I tossed just over 33 BTC towards a 30 GHash/s miner that I've yet to see, and I have no way to recuperate those costs. Even if BFL were to "refund" me, I'm sure I'd only get the ~$649 worth of BTC, which basically equates to a huge-ass, 0% loan to BFL for no services rendered.
Fuck BFL. Fuck me too for not doing more research. What I'd give to have those Bitcoins back. Some lessons are learned harder than others, and I've really bit it bad with this. 
@_date: 2013-03-10 09:52:49
Just remember that difficulty is going to continue to rise, especially once ASIC miners are widespread. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a near-exponential increase in difficulty after BFL and other ASIC manufacturers have everything pulled together.
The price/performance ratio on the BitForce Jalapeno miner is much worse than the other, more fully-fledged miners, but it is also a smaller investment. If something goes belly-up overnight, a person that just ordered the Jalapeno would be out less money.
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:12:13
On top of that, their refunds are in USD only. It's more than a loan - it's basically free money for them. I paid for a 30 Ghash/s miner back in January for more than thirty-three Bitcoins and would only get a few back if I were to get a refund now. It's downright scummy, and I wish I'd done at least a tad more research before investing.

I sure hope the OP did. I ordered from BFL on January 31st and coughed up 33.5170 Bitcoins ($683 then; ~$1,240 now). I'm beginning to somewhat regret that. My order number is just below 20,000. 
I'm hoping I can at least break even now. I could ask for a refund back, but they'd only pay out what the Bitcoins are worth now. That would basically be giving them all the money they wanted for no service or product rendered.

Factoring in hardware costs, yes. Assuming retail cost for the GPU, it would take over two months to break even at this current difficulty and market demand. I was fortunate to have obtained this graphics card for just over $300, but most people aren't going to find deals like that. Even if they did, difficulty is going to continue to rise. Market demand may keep up, but if someone's looking at GPUs solely for mining it's a risky investment, to say the least.
@_date: 2013-03-08 07:40:17
Both, really. There's no saying where things will go. Early adopters are likely to see a decent profit, but if there are significantly cheaper or considerably faster ASICs in the near future, the margins could easily slim or become non-existent. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:25:34
That's what I was told to do at $30. Glad I didn't!
I did, however, blow 33 Bitcoins when they were $20 a piece for an ASIC miner. The price increase is going to be great for when the mining hardware finally arrives, but man does it hurt knowing that those would have been worth nearly $5,000 now.
But alas, I saw $20 of value in Bitcoin at that time. No use regretting it. Bitcoin isn't going to go anywhere if people do nothing *but* hoard.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:20:20
If network difficulty remains even *remotely* close to where it is now and price remains stable, those investments are going to be recouped insanely fast. If I received the 30 Ghash/s ASIC I ordered right at this moment, I would make up my investment in about three days.
That said, difficulty will continue to rise unless the GPU miners start dropping out en masse and the ASIC miners don't have enough horsepower to make up the difference on their own. Of course, price may continue to rise as well...it may also drop like a rock.
The future is going to be interesting - for better or for worse. Bitcoin is the kind of excitement that helps keep some of us running on a daily basis. That, and a decentralized P2P cryptocurrency is just a flat-out awesome idea.

For almost all intents and purposes, GPU mining is already dead. I got into Bitcoin mining a couple years ago when I already owned a Radeon HD 5870+5970 Tri-Fire setup. My enthusiasm for technology actually garnered me money when I originally just wanted "lol moar FPS".
I'm now on a Radeon HD 7970, overclocked to my video BIOS' maximum clocks of 1125/1575 MHz. Even with this hardware, the payout is abysmal - barely enough to cover the electricity. I'm just mining to keep my room warm right now in this Minnesota winter. These cards put out some real heat!!

I ordered a 30 Ghash/s unit well before the price hike, but I did so with Bitcoins. I spent about 33 Bitcoins for the order. I would have earned considerably more by just holding instead of spending them on mining equipment. I know I may not recuperate those 33 Bitcoins in full with the exponentially increasing difficulty. I'm just looking to ensure that it's not a total bust.
Fortunately, I haven't put anything at risk. Everything I've ever spent with the idea of investment has been spent with the mentality that I've lost it all, right then and there. Bitcoin is one heck of a good financial teacher!

@_date: 2013-03-05 10:49:27
I may have exaggerated a bit, but the margins right now are *very* thin and only getting smaller.  I'm seeing about 650 Mhash/s on the 7970, which is ~฿0.15 per day. That's right below $6 per day. Not bad for what is essentially "free" money, but most people will want to use their GPUs for more than just Bitcoin mining now.
Anyone buying into GPU mining this late in the game is almost guaranteed to see a net loss unless they have free electricity and can purchase the hardware at a spectacularly low cost. FPGA miners are in the same boat as well, but at least you get a better performance/watt ratio with them.
@_date: 2013-06-11 10:56:55
I ordered a 30 Ghash/s miner for $649 back in January. I paid with Bitcoins, which for market value at that time was around 33 BTC. I still haven't received any product.
I'm not going to be recouping my losses in full now. I've accepted that and just had to unfortunately cut them. At this point in the game, I'm just hoping I receive product soon enough that it won't be a complete bust...

@_date: 2013-07-25 01:30:15
If it's any consolation, several months ago I sunk over 33 Bitcoins into a 30 Ghash/s miner.
I'd love to get a refund from BFL for what I paid in. Either way, they make profit. If I got a refund, I'd get $649 worth of Bitcoins today, which...isn't that much. It would be free money for BFL for *no services rendered*.
It's a shame I didn't do more research. BFL's screwed me hard. The least they could have done is used some lube.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:30:46
When it arrives, market difficulty is going to be significantly higher. I wouldn't be surprised if it increased ten-fold or one hundred-fold by the time my equipment arrives. Of course, if price continues to rise, it will still be relatively easy to recuperate costs.
Besides, I'm in Bitcoin for the long haul. Outside of a catastrophic market failure, I see myself investing and reinvesting in it for my entire life. It's a darned good idea that I want to see succeed. Even something like this could be all but a minor setback in the long run.

How much did you crank up the difficulty? ASIC miners are probably going to be far more disruptive than some people believe.

The enhanced network protection is an amazing thing, but it is going to cut pretty hard into profits for all but the earliest of adopters.

I started mining back in early-to-mid 2011 when I already had a Radeon HD 5870+5970 Tri-Fire setup primarily used for gaming. 1 Ghash/s at that time was largely unheard of, and there was no extra cost to me (outside of the first power supply I blew up)! I sold off several of those Bitcoins to pay rent and buy games (because, hey, graphics cards). I have less than a dozen Bitcoins on-hand at this very moment, but [I regret nothing](
Also, I have an ASIC on the way. Paid for it with close to three dozen Bitcoins, which would now be over $2,500. My sentiment is once again shared with the chicken.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:31:57
I don't know why it's so darned difficult for some people to hold onto money. If somebody is actively worried about the value of their Bitcoins going up or down too much, then they probably have more "invested" than they should. Also, all but the craftiest (which, if you're reading this, is unlikely to be you - it's definitely not me!) will end up cutting a loss if they try day-trading. Just buy Bitcoin with dollar cost averaging and call it a day.

Hello! Spent ~33 BTC back when that was worth ~$650. That's worth almost $2500 now. Do I regret the purchase? Nope, not really. As stated by numerous others in this thread, Bitcoin needs to actually be used for goods and services to gain any real traction. That ~$20/BTC price point was an area that made me feel as if my Bitcoins finally had some respectable spending power. 
Even if the Bitcoins that people spent on ASIC miners would have been worth considerably more today, they're still higher up on the shipping lists and will more than likely still come out well ahead barring an exponential difficulty increase or market crash.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:02:26

*Edit: Just read Rage_In_Peace's reply. Information in my comment may be highly inaccurate. Take with a large grain of salt.
They honor refunds, but only for what the current value is. I spent about 33 Bitcoins on their $649 miner back in February. Those Bitcoins are now worth ~$8,250. 
I could ask BFL for my money back, and I'm sure they'd happily oblige, but the deal is that they only give back what you paid in USD. A &gt;$7500 loan for nothing? Not bad.
Really hoping these things get shipping soon. The buyer's remorse is starting to kick in. I wouldn't feel bad if I sold those Bitcoins or just purchased goods with them, but the fact that I've spent them and have since received nothing isn't boding well.
Not to mention that I'm sure I'm pretty darned low in the queue...
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:57:21
I'm finding a surprising number of people that know about Bitcoin, and I'm currently living in a fairly rural area. Heck, I strike up conversations daily with a coworker about Bitcoin news, even though he doesn't current hold any.
My friends are also starting to bring it up without me even mentioning it. They'll state that they see it covered in the news or that they've read about it somewhere. 
Bitcoin is still well in its infancy, but I'm starting to see it catching some real mainstream attention. These last few weeks - this last week in particular - have been astronomical for Bitcoin. That's not to say that "this time is different", but I do expect Bitcoin to ultimately survive and thrive. I'm sure there will be several bubbles that get popped on the long ride there, so until then I shall just enjoy myself. I've held through a couple other "massive" bubbles, and I plan to hold tight through this one when/if a correction occurs.

As mentioned in the article, it would take over six months to recuperate the 1.99 BTC running 24/7 at current difficulty. Take into consideration power consumption (minimal though it may be) and that difficulty is pretty much rising exponentially and it becomes rather likely that these costs would never be recovered. I would recommend avoiding these, personally. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 13:59:39
UPDATE: My BFL miner has just shipped after months of waiting. This is...interesting timing. I'm never going to mine back the Bitcoins I spent, but at least it's something. I won't be making this mistake again.

I'm almost always staunchly against the bland, predictable memes we see everyday, but this one was actually rather clever and gave me a good chuckle.
If people aren't free to post general Bitcoin humor in then where can they comfortably submit it? There are other subreddits if you're looking strictly for discussion only, and even other submissions with quality discussion on this very subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:12:46
Good point. Overall, I'm thrilled for Bitcoin's future! I see myself constantly investing and reinvesting in it for my entire life, assuming nothing catastrophic happens to the market. I've learned more from a few months of Bitcoin enthusiasm than I have from any economics course.

Your best bet would be the [mining article]( over at the Bitcoin wiki. The most popular [Bitcoin forum]( is home to several great discussions as well and is a great place to check out if you're looking to keep up with the latest information.

Ah, this must have been a recent change. I responded to TheControlsFreak myself, but I may be wrong in this case.
If BFL isn't honoring refunds, they darned well better get something shipping soon or they're going to probably start running into some ugly issues with the law!

What kind of financial markets are you talking about? There are *very* few markets out there that ever get even close to $1 trillion. It's not until you're dealing with massive indexes like Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ that you're dealing with trillions of dollars. Investors are more interested in ROI than just putting their money in markets with big numbers. This is why some make a killing on penny stocks while others are fortunate to see a steady profit on well-established names.
That said, this $1 billion market capitalization is still a massive milestone! It's sure to generate some extra buzz and hopefully garner some publicity. 2013 has been a remarkable year for Bitcoin, and it doesn't show any signs of soon slowing.

I didn't sell.
I also never bought.
Owning a Radeon HD 5870+5970 Tri-Fire setup before Bitcoin mining became mainstream/popular was quite glorious! I don't even have one dozen coins anymore, but I'm here for the long haul. Bitcoin is one heck of a wild roller coaster on the ups and on the downs.
If anything, I'd say the downs are almost more enjoyable than the ups. I find quite a bit of humor in all the panic sellers out there. Quite shameful when people invest their entire life savings into something without long, hard thought, and then end up getting burnt. Those do tend to be the best lessons in life, though, I'm sure!

To add to this: We would need a market cap of $12.063 ***TRILLION*** for this to happen. And that's with the current Bitcoins in circulation. The cap would need to be even higher as more coins continue to be mined.
For comparison, our market cap is only $11.31 *billion* at the moment. Some of the more bullish estimates see Bitcoin going to ~$100-300 billion, which would put each Bitcoin around roughly $10,000-30,000 per.
Those gains aren't bad, but do remember that those numbers were extrapolated with some of the most liberal estimates out there. It's unlikely that we'll be anywhere near that point in the foreseeable future.
Of course, Bitcoin is the honey badger of currency, so take all of this with a huge grain of salt.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:22:20
Assuming BFL isn't a scam...
And before y'all jump on me for saying that, I actually do have an ASIC miner pre-ordered through them! The Bitcoins I paid for the Little Single 'SC' would now be worth over $6,000, so I may be rather bitter while I wait!

If you can live comfortably and aren't concerned about your fiat money supporting you, then by all means, invest as much as you like. If you want to withdraw some of your coins as fiat money, then that's your choice as well. Do whatever feels right, but always have a plan in place.
I'm in a similar position as you. I'll be holding Bitcoins for quite a while. I fully expect that we'll someday see another massive correction/crash, but I'm also fairly confident that we'll recover from it. 
I'm *extremely* bullish for the future of Bitcoin, especially after some transactions today, but I'd never put fiat money into it if it meant I'd be missing payments on bills or couldn't reliably make ends meet. 
View it as gambling with a bit of a calculated risk. None of us know where this crazy coaster will take us. Sit back and enjoy the ride!

Only a few months, so they'll still be backed up a good while. They do process refunds; however, they only refund for the current value of the Bitcoins. I'd still be out over $700 from their original value, which would basically be giving them all of the cash for no service rendered or equipment obtained. I'll be holding out. ASIC miners are still impressive, and their exclusivity may yet make them wonderfully profitable, especially early on.
As I've said in numerous other threads, even if I'm left in the hole on this particular investment, there are people that have been through *far* worse.
@_date: 2013-02-16 13:28:43
Have to spend it all? Well, that's about ฿950,000 more than I'd need for an excruciatingly long time. I'd spend ~฿50,000 to get over to New Zealand, purchase a nice home, get back into college to study computer science and eventually earn a PhD, then use the huge remainder to help others attain a solid education. My biggest dreams only require a comparatively small sum to get rolling; I'd much rather share the wealth with others that could make better use of it.

This is the case. I've thought long and hard about how both sides can be so profitable, and I've realized just how much of a net win gift cards are for stores.
Gift cards get people to buy stuff at a store that they otherwise may not have purchased, or may have purchased elsewhere. The gift card is unlikely to cover the *exact* amount of the transaction, so people are either going to pay extra beyond the gift card, or return later to spend the remaining balance. Both cases are great for stores. Returning customers are a huge part of being a successful business.
It makes sense that companies would be willing to offer discounts for bulk gift card purchases. The small percentage they lose there is more than made up by the markup in-store.
Gyft also gets to have a great rewards system for Bitcoin thanks to extraordinarily small fees. Likewise, people purchasing via PayPal also get more points than people paying with credit/debit cards, again thanks to smaller fees.
The point system is also a tremendous system for Gyft to have. People are happy because they get some money back for gift cards, and those points are used for repeat purchases at Gyft.
It's an awesome business model for everyone, really. The store gets business, Gyft makes some money, and people (especially Bitcoin users!) can now purchase stuff that they otherwise may have been unable to all while getting some points back for it. I would love to see just what kind of margins Gyft is operating on. I can't imagine it's ridiculously high-margin, but if enough people are using their service that wouldn't really matter.
Sorry for rambling, by the way. I just think it's cool how there are so many "winners" in Gyft's model.

Yes. I've been kind of open about it in previous posts. Someone could easily find my identity if they so desired to.
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:16:44
That is correct. I've ordered one myself, but as HTL2001 pointed out, they aren't shipping yet. ASIC mining is going to overcome pretty much any slim margin of hope for GPU mining, but this isn't a bad thing. That said, there's also likely going to be a rather sharp increase in difficulty unless the drop in GPU miners evens things a bit. There's no guarantee that an ASIC miner is going to be profitable by the time BFL has them shipping, although it is likely. 
Also, FWIW, the one I ordered was for 33-some odd Bitcoins a few months ago which then totaled up to the $649 asking price. Those Bitcoins would total to over $1,400 now. Really hoping that ASIC miner pays itself off at this rate... :D
