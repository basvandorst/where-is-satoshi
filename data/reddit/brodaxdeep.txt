I am with coinbase for years, and I never had a problem
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:15:43
Like almost 100% of exchanges , or apps, or everything installed in your smartphone, I don't care

It's just a game you don't get real Btc
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:52:23
You learn that BTC is real now? There are like a lot of years that it started to be real lmao
@_date: 2019-10-03 13:44:40
I live in granada lmao, where is it?
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:20:15
Ooh yes!
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:35:14
In a few months is going to be the Bitcoin Halving, so I would buy BTC now haha
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:53:35
Do u imagine that?
@_date: 2019-10-03 13:27:43
Probably not, bank can say it to get benefits too, but I don't think that Btc raise to that price

@_date: 2019-10-06 09:11:15
What is it used for? I can get money with my coinbase card in any ATM, don't need to look for a BTC ATM , so? What's the use of it?
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:13:26
Think the same

Of course you can do, via ATM, search on Google for sure it will be an BTC ATM in your town of near :)
There are other ways like online P2P selling, but it can take so long to find someone to buy BTC 
Fastest way is exchanges, if you don't want to, BTC ATM
