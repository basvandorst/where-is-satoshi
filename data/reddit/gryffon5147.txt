No.  Every crypto put together is worth 350 billion or so.  The global stock market is exponentially larger.

You don't tell people about your investments. Ever.  If it does poorly, you look like a fool.  If it does well, you look like someone who has money.  Either way, you lose.

Honest question, and feel free to downvote me, I don't mind.  But, why invest with such small sums?  What's the upside, a few dozen dollars?  Even if it doubles, a few hundred?  It seems like the brain power and stress used to worry about it, check prices constantly, is absolutely not worth it.

Co-mingling funds is the easiest way to destroy friendships and families, especially in a volatile investment instrument they have very little understanding of.  
Buy them their own ledger as a gift.

You will lose money with hardware depreciation and electricity costs.

Do you literally not see the costs involved in powering a computer 24/7, and utilizing the brand new graphics card at nearly full load almost constantly?

Don't tell family about investments generally, especially stuff like Bitcoin.  If it goes poorly, you look like a fool.  If it goes well, the typical problems associated with money come up.  These things destroy families and friendships.

Mining is literally not worth the price of burning through your expensive new hardware.

That's what I did :D

What are you going to do when it's time to file for taxes?  What if you get audited?  Are you going to tell the police you "photoshopped my id", when they arrest your parents?

Fair enough.  To answer your question, I'm waiting until tomorrow around this time to see if I should buy several thousand dollars more.

Honestly it's not worth the brain cells worrying about it or the fees with just 50 bucks.  
Study hard, go to HYPS, pick a major that's actually useful.

Go buy yourself something nice. It's not going up ten times.
