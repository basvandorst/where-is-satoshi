you still better transfer it to the new wallet, who knows where she lost it...
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:06:44
It is ponzi for them, because they did not invest in time. Ironically, there is still time to invest...
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:49:31
wouldn't it be more like 4$ and the rest went back to his wallet?
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:32:36
seems like the new version has both wallets enabled by default...someone got bi*chslapped by google, it seems
@_date: 2018-09-23 06:26:56
could have tried if he was brave enough, but instead attacked others, then whined about his bitcoin stash value...cmon man...he could have been a hero, and now in spite of his achievement, he will not be respected much.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:25:22
Ok,now they fixed it and both BCH and BTC wallets are active on default.
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:42:21
you should go on r/btc...those fools are drowning in tears...they realize their shitcoin will never be able to dent the original bitcoin value...every post is about devaluing btc, and it crapped all over them when in spite of the serious bug, the price rose ��
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:44:30
I stand corrected then.
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:43:43
it is, but never underestimate the panic button...
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:42:56
but, but...i thought that fake btc (read:bc(tras)h guys said the bitcoin core is broke, and that the price will go down...
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:45:23
Ok my fault then. I don't know why people are saying that you have to go to settings and enable BTC wallet.
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:20:58
in this case no adoption &gt; bch adoption

3000 is what I am thinking too...
@_date: 2018-09-23 08:02:12
this guy should be also given a 100k if those are the rules, just after he makes a normal article about the bug discovery...
@_date: 2018-09-27 08:08:30
man, for some reason, this describes bch perfectly :)
@_date: 2018-09-22 12:37:35

@_date: 2019-11-25 11:22:38
I have been saying it for years. Learn to customize fees, and stay away from opportunistic processors and wallets like bitpay or [bitcoin.com]( jack up the fees, so they can promote alts...
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:48:01
bunch of liars, and when you confronted, they mindlessly repeat "december, december"
@_date: 2019-11-26 10:22:38
Not in this decade..
@_date: 2018-10-27 05:05:46
getting tired of bch shillers mantra about high bitcoin fees...
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:04:06
just don't sell...or exchange into any of the alt/shitcoins
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:19:28
the one i got like this had about 1 btc in it, all the same sum transfers of around 800 usd in 2 day span...i wonder if that were  fake transfers so i would think it is for real, or did people really pay...
@_date: 2018-10-13 08:21:04
well, the ones that can think by themselves, will soon see through that site's bullshit...the mindless ones, we don't even need in the bitcoin system.
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:40:51
it is not really a problem, just a bunch of hot air...
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:26:48
Sadly, price is the only thing that will make people buy. People are not ready to work for the common good, otherwise the world would be much better place to live in. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:07:08
Hahahahahahahaha, you must have never driven sti, evolution or similar...probably think bmw or audi is better ������

lose :P and yes, that water looks dangerous for a drunk person...where tf is the rail???
@_date: 2018-10-07 09:26:52
i just sent 12$ transaction with 0.04$ fee...confirmed almost instantly
@_date: 2019-11-27 05:13:19
Of course you did, but not many people believe that. My old ATR was maybe not the fastest on the straight linr, but in the corners, much faster cars would stay behind :)
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:30:18
soon as i heard about it (march 2103), spent all i had in bank to buy gpu miners...the rest is history
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:29:12
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:37:41
of course
they will come crying soon, just leave them be...also, the weak mindset pushes them to rather have 1 full shitcoin than 0.071 bitcoin (per example �� )
by spreading out like that, even if one of the shitcoins gains value, they will lose out on others, but you did your best and told them the right thing...
@_date: 2018-10-04 04:34:50
and if you hold 0.28 BCH, you are poor...
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:40:46
nah, you good with the sti...
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:18:29
that would make BCH a scam
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:18:37
THIS!!! people do not understand that it was an actual attack on the BTC network, and that it passed that test...hopefully the dishonest miners that did it lost a shitload of money...something tells me by checking out the prices in the last year or two...they did :D
@_date: 2018-10-07 06:00:48
do you even know what year it is? now that there is no more successful attacks on bitcoin network, fees are low. also, no one is stupid enough to believe people will try to double spend 8$ transaction. so go away bch shill boy...
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:00:46
high fees they said on bitcoin.com ��������
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:49:20
LOL, apart for owning bitcoin, having a dream to not do anything in life is a wrong approach...  
btw, having your parents as a backup makes this zero risk...
@_date: 2019-11-07 05:13:13
I don't know about you, but I have been using BTC since 2013, and never had any trouble. Even with high fees period, I always used the wallets with customizable fee option, and although I waited a tad longer, the funds got there. To me BTC still works without a problem, and I know it is way more secure than any other alts.  
That said, yes I also use credit cards, wire transfer, cash...etc. Regular stuff...
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:49:01
haha, that is ridiculous
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:40:06
make sure you reset it when you get it
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:04:31
dumb luck :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:34:54
I agree, but just changing btc to usd, then buying ltc, or any other crypto is taxable? i am sure they have it worked out, but that is a little ridiculous...
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:08:04
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:03:54
i am all in btc, but this is dumb :(
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:37:35
not from any other coins...
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:30:11
Yes, well we are mostly talking about Desktops, aren't we?
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:21:08
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:39:10
there are far better ways to do it...
@_date: 2019-08-20 08:41:59
No offense, but this greedy approach, does not really seem all that healthy...  
You could save in BTC, and still enjoy life a little...
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:56:58
wirex kind of did a similar thing...charged like 4 bucks, yet the tx they sent the coin with was 3x less
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:30:30
We are not comparing it to USD, but to other crypto. Dominance nearing 70%
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:15:21

@_date: 2019-06-18 19:39:27
Ok that makes more sense, but still simplex fee is too high.  
The best I found was wirex so far
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:43:50
Lmao, literally the worst advice on so many levels...

Try to preview a buy for 100 euro and see how many btc they say you will get. Then go to preev and put 100 euro there...the difference is 25%...you get only 75% of what preev says...

yes, very lucky...you cant do squat without IRS knocking at your door...
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:55:56
haha check out their conversion rate for btc, they take 25% :) what a joke...

Yeah, no matter how much it goes up in the next year or so, it will go to ballistic heights in 3-4 years, so I am gonna keep on investing about 10% of the paycheck per month.

Average user uses windows...average users make about 90% at least...
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:41:04
Right :) if windows was free, no average user would ever look in linux direction. It's a money thing. I am not saying linux is bad, it is just that windows is more useful. Btw, what kind of computers does an average kid want, and what does he want to run on it? :)

@_date: 2019-06-05 19:37:26
Bitpay is a no-no
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:59:17
I understand, but then how do you know your VPN is not keeping logs? also if they go through https, who can read traffic? can mods see the IP's?
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:49:10
Ok, ok, maybe a bit more :) but he is young enough to live to see some high btc prices :)
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:01:10
Of course, I am using as much as possible, and re-buying every month from my salary. Only way to do it I think. The companies probably covert it right back to fiat, but that is on them :)
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:04:55

@_date: 2019-12-03 08:16:01
explain it to me then, since you are :)
@_date: 2019-12-20 13:06:39
All other cryptos are scam...
@_date: 2019-12-12 09:37:59
cardcoins have btc at 8600 usd...what a scam..
@_date: 2019-12-27 09:40:27
nah...don't fall under a psychological trap about owning a whole something...people who think like that, are in much worse position, than the ones that wanted any amount of btc...they are stuck with shitcoins who lose value as opposed to btc...
@_date: 2019-04-19 07:44:35
of course...people who think this will solve anything major, are kidding themselves :) the payment system might be a little better and cooler to use, because of the back-end, but that is about it...
@_date: 2019-04-30 08:52:56
you misspelled ancient
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:05:40
yeah, also fuck everyone that copied bitcoin, and created their own alts/shits...
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:55:19
don't sell yourself short, though...but that 4k computer man...
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:58:28
yeah, owning a motorbike, does not contribute to the longevity of life...
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:18:56
because I have bought it with USD? if I mined it, i would not care as much :)
@_date: 2018-11-02 05:27:04
Seems legit :)
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:10:49
nononono...65 btc is waaaaaay too much to keep...invest more in stocks, keep some cash, buy property...you will still have plenty to keep in btc...not more than half, like 40 btc max...what i would do
but absolutely treat yourself and your family with something you wanted and could not afford before, but was barely out of reach
good luck!
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:01:48
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:27:37
meanwhile, bch shills at rbtc are delusionaly repeating "nothing has changed, high fees, dec 17, slow confirms" rinse and repeat...
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:43:17
I am sure they are just looking out for their best interest, so they can dump BCH at high price. No one can be that stupid to think BTC will suddenly end, and everyone else will start using BCH all of the sudden.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:28:30
and that is why you invested your kids christmas money into something that can disappear overnight? very irresponsible parenting...

hmm...that is a bad title for sure, you should not ever use drugs, unless it is prescribed by your doctor
and yes you should most definitely spend btc.
i have been using btc daily in a way to pay something for lets say 0.05 btc, then i go and purchase 0.06 btc to replace. not a bad strategy if you are investing. i use mostly wirex...
