Technicals show probability, they don't predict. A few millionaires have been made so far, and there will be more too. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 11:51:27
It absolutely is. It's known as "smart money". There are people who are profiting from the price staying low.
@_date: 2015-06-05 10:16:45
Well, yeah if they have enough. Market is low volume, someone could have millions of dollars worth and hold price down rather easily while still holding a very large amount. Just chipping off small percentages.
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:46:41
Not if there is a bigger game at play, which is what we are discussing.

My friends that know I'm into it are starting to think that I'm crazy with some unquestionable devotion to this magic internet money, and no amount of FUD they inform me about will change my mind. 
I shrug off crashes because I've seen them before. I don't get excited when it rises in price quickly, because it is completely unpredictable and volatile. 
Some people will only ever follow what the news tells them, because to them it is all the proof they need.

As bubfranks has said, infinitely divisible. If all but 10 bitcoins were destroyed, we could still use them for their purpose, even if we all had 0.000000001 BTC each

The only reason why he knows anything about crypto in general is because of max Kaiser introducing him to it. And max is pushing his own "STARTcoin", he's got Russell to go along with it. 
I was listening to Russell's podcast he does with a friend and they briefly mentioned max and Bitcoin, Russell was quick to point out that Max's currency is STARTcoin not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-04 02:10:00
It means a big price movement is coming. Don't believe me? Look at a chart. Every large move is prefaced with lingering low volume sideways. It just requires a catalyst.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:34:10
yeah go download the .exe and run it. I'm sure that will work out brilliantly for you.

Good thing the market isn't all over the place, with prices wildly fluctuating by the hour.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:33:46
Back in April I was watching the charts rise, I didn't buy because I couldn't get hold of then quick enough, it crashes shortly after, and like many I'm kicking myself for not buying in the dip. But I'm buying slowly now, 0.1 here and there. Hell I already got a return and I won't be hurting if it drops to 0 tomorrow. This is one hell of a ride

Why don't you just pay a good designer 2BTC to redesign. Instead of making loads of others work for free &amp; then be let down.

Where you buying your BTC in UK? I used Bitstamp to get mine but it was months ago, not sure it still works.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:15:33
Basically, everything can go wrong. Tomorrow it could all just vanish, its incredibly high risk. Actual market traders wouldn't touch this with a barge pole. Only buy with money you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:06:57
Great news to wake up to!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:39:28
I'm talking if you are UK. You would go to bitstamp, request a deposit, and then go to transferwise, deposit £, they will change them to EUR, then you enter in the bank info that bitstamp gave you, wait a couple of days for bitstamp to receive the EUR, then it will change them to USD and then you can buy BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:25:46
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:41:34
Thats exactly what i thought around mid April. Then after the crash i was happy with myself for not getting involved. Now i regret it again. I plan to buy slowly, just build a little wallet.

I have an app called bitcoin bleep that does this, it also has a new all time high price alarm. Think it's set to gox

This is giving me an idea, i wonder if small local shops might see success as BTC eases its way into peoples lives. Hmmmm.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:25:19
There are a few ways to buy, you could check localbitcoins to see if someone close to you is selling them.
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:28:18
It displays the price on the icon so you dont have to open the app, and it goes off like an alarm when btc reaches a new high.
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:42:53
I'm gonna need some reassurance about this.

Have you read his post?  


@_date: 2013-07-02 11:08:13
Cheers! Just trying it now. There are two features in a BTC ticker that i would just throw money at;  
Notifications that i can control (price above xxBTC) &amp; tickers for btct.co markets etc. Not sure if these are things you could implement, great work so far.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:15:07
Would you mind explaining why MT.Gox coming back up will drop the price right down? I mean, i'm hoping it will so i can buy. But i'm not entirely sure why it will plummet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:22:40
Just been messing around with your code, but i can't get it to pull GBP. Will i need to use a different sites api?

Could i have one please? i'm desperate for a reliable app.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:17:11
Alt coins are coins are simply that, alternative coins. It is possible that one could overtake bitcoin in popularity some time in the future, or at least trail behind it. Some have certain advantages over bitcoin but may never take off.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:23:27
Hey, giving it a try now. I would love to be able to set up notifications from places such as coinflow too, an app that could do that would be cool.
@_date: 2013-09-06 09:01:22
You say "Based on nothing", i was under the impression that these speculations are at least based on signs pointing to it? However much of a circle jerk it may be, people are still fickle and non-news quickly dies out.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:18:00
Perfect, this makes much more sense than the arguing going on up there.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:38:53
For anyone else reading, i was initally put off BitBargain because of the slightly higher than trade price. But once i bought, saw how quick and easy it was to do a bank transfer through it, i've used it again since! I sound like a shill, but honestly.. its the easiest method i've found to buy with GBP. Back in the days around the April bubble the only way i could buy with GBP was through a couple of strange looking websites to acquire EUR, then those were sent to Bitstamp. Its much easier now, and i guess it will get even easier in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:37:58
Ah! I have a GtX 660, i tried solo mining last week just to see what its like, decided i didn't have a hash rate high enough to bother pursuing it more. Think i'll join the pool and chip in!.

I have an app called Bitcoin Bleep, i woke up this morning to it making noises because a new price never before reached had happened. Worked great as an alarm.

Me also, if you don't mind.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:23:13
do it via transferwise, then on to bitstamp.

I used to be a flash animator at an advertising company. The higher-ups sent us off on a training course to learn after effects, so that we can create higher quality material. Eventually i got made redundant from that job and i have been freelancing ever since. The key is to find a substantial project that you can really get your teeth into. I was lucky enough to know a guy who makes Facebook games for a living, and he asked me to create a few videos for one of his new games. Its been great fun! So yeah, there is potential for freelance work, but you might have to expand a little on the services (i offer graphic design too).
@_date: 2013-07-02 12:13:16
Yeah its great. Maybe some labeling on the live graph too, it doesn't make much sense to glance as cause there is no time period. Also (i'm sure you will implement it) can i choose which currencies shows? I'm only really interested in the GBP ticker. And yeah if you added support for btct that would be amazing, the site is difficult to navigate on iphone and an app would make it so much easier. Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:55:34
Every time i read about other peoples slight investment misses, it hurts. I've said this before on here, but i toyed with the idea of buying loads in £ back in May. I didn't, so i'm slowly building my BTC up now. Lets hope we can revisit these comments in a years time and laugh, friend.

I *tried* to buy BTC at around $210, when it was on its way up and i had been lurking in the shadows of this community for a few weeks. I live in the UK, and it turned out that it was really difficult at the time to get BTC. As luck would have it.. by the time i managed to get the funds and a sure-fire way of buying.. price had crashed and i picked them up at $90-ish.  
Then i got into various securities, and mainly enjoy playing around and seeing if i can make more by trading, with the occasional purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:36:44
You sound so excited! Go transfer them somewhere safe. Withdraw 10% and sit on the rest.
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:22:19
I'm counting on a minor bubble to buy more, last time i bought it was £66, of course it might never get back down to a price i feel is cheap enough, but still i wouldn't mind it.
@_date: 2013-06-27 08:10:21
No problem! Great work! I got confused because google searches about the site brought up nothing, then after some digging i found you!

@_date: 2013-04-23 22:50:18
Is there any other option? Ive seen bitbargain.. but we really need more options. With the transferwise thing it seems that acquiring and selling BTC in the UK is pretty tough now.  
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:02:57
And you could have put all that effort into something actually productive you moron.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:48:26
Are you kidding? Its currently only $4 for 1mBTC, thats ultra cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:28:22
