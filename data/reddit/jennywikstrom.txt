That's the beauty of using MediaWiki: The desktop version has these handy "edit" and "edit source" buttons everyone can play around with on the top of the page. Boomers can use those to fix small details and zoomers think it's a blog they can't edit because the mobile version has another skin with no edit buttons. :)

I see big problems with this "limited resources" argument to begin with.
First of all, it's up to the miners to set the block size limit - not those running nodes. These days there is no such thing as a "limited resources" mining operation. Either you can invest millions in ASICs or you can't. If you can then you can also afford a decent Internet connection.
Secondly, it's not 1996 or 2006 so node operators will be fine. Fiber connections are the norm in the Fascist Union and many parts of Asia. If you're in a third world country like the USA then your speeds may vary but for US and Japan and non-rural areas of China speed is not an issue. There is no way I would notice if blocks are 0.5MB or 32MB on my 100/100mbit connection which costs about $20/month. Harddrive space is also a non-issue, $100 for a 3TB drive is cheap enough. The full Bitcoin blockchain indexes sits at 110GB. That would be a lot in 1996 but we moved on since then.
The whole "limited resources" argument is flawed. If you are using a Pentium 2 and dial-up internet today then you can whine all you want about not being able to run a node, I do not care.
As for high value transactions.. I don't think BTC has much of a future for that either. Right now it doesn't have much of a future for any kind of transactions. At best it will be like gold. Right now BTC is at best useful for storing value in a paper wallet under your bed. This is really sad.

Yes, it's genius, really, it's like I rob you for $103 and then I kindly hand you $3 .. and now you're .. happy because you got $3 back.
The whaleclub interview where Phil from Bitfinex flat out admitted that they outright stole 10% extra from customers to have a slush-fund to fight off lawsuits and cover their own expenses is what made me sure that selling my BFX-tokens and leaving for good was the right choice.
