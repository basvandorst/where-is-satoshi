Does your shop actually accept bitcoin?

A long time ago, when I was 14 or 15 or something, I tried to make money online listening to the radio on some obscure website. They paid something like .01 cents an hour or something really ridiculous like that, and you had to have a $10 minimum to cash out. I did the math, I would have about $100 in a year! "Wow, that's like, that whole year's gas money!" I thought (I didn't even have a car). After a few months of leaving my computer on non-stop with online radios on multiple tabs, I reached the $10 mark.
Then the website went offline before I could cash out. I often wonder how much my mom had to pay for the electricity I was using during that period.

Thank you so much for this.

This is funny considering I hit hard times (moving has a lot of little hidden expenses) and had to cash out. But now I'm back in baby!

I had no idea there was a "D" in "Vegas". Must be silent.

Thanks for that.

I made the mistake of posting it before watching it in its entirety. I guess it's trying to sell some book. Sucks.

Can someone ELI5 this for me? I like bitcoin but just can't keep up with what's going on.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:18:37
Wow.. nuts. Thanks.

Great then maybe he can do a combination of eating only McDonalds and buying it with Bitcoin and he can die knowing he lived a rich, fulfilling life.

 I linked my back account.
edit; right now it's actually lower than when I bought. $680.72=1BTC

This is way out of hand. I check that site often because I find it humorous. The8thbit has told me a lot about Bitcoin (not all of which I retain) and the site posted some things that are contrary to what he told me. Since I don't know jack shit about Bitcoin, I decided to ask him about it so he could clear some things up for me. I have been following Drew Dee's sites for many years, I know his sense of humor, this is what he thinks of Bitcoin, it's not a satire. Based on his post on his website, he thinks it's fucking retarded. Feel like I had to spell that out for you. If you spent 5 fucking minutes looking at some of the other shit he posts on there, you would know that.
Sorry I left you in the dark for so fucking long about every little detail about this post. Maybe now you can fucking sleep at night knowing that I don't know a fucking thing about BTC and was honestly asking someone who does to clear some things up for me. I'm sorry this post has made life so hard for you in the last 13 hours.

What a crock of shit. Fuck that 'teacher'.

Glad I closed that account years ago. Fuck Chase.

Guess I'll just wait it out and see haha.

Walls of text tickle you, isn't that funny?
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:45:39
Well then!

Thanks I was watching it fluctuate like a hawk, just waiting to hit 700! Super excited to support something like this and see where it goes!
