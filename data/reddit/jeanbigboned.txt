Because reasons and fundamentals right?

A small part. Most of the stuff Ross got convincted for has nothing to do with these 2 FBI agents.

I understand what you are saying but it is the way it is. Entrapping Ross and "helping" him was part of the operation. 
And most importantly: All this time Ross had the option not to give the order to have people killed. Nobody put a gun to his head. 
Err why am i being downvoted?

What's the point? As he said it's been posted dozens of times in these kind of threads already. You and others will just reject or ignore it. Look how you're upvoted and the guy who mentioned it (and who was right) got downvoted to hell. 
And even if he gets convicted for it you will just call it a conspiracy or whatever.

You missed the whole point. Of course it's entrapment. It was part of the operation against Ross. Minus the theft of course. Which was wrong but at the same time he could use it for the entrapment. 
If the police set up bait cars in the hood to see if people steal them should they be convicted of car theft as well?
They tried to get Ross. This was part of it. 
Why your nonsense is upvoted 26 times is beyond me. 
Also you can't deny Ross tried to have people killed and at the same time blame the FBI agent for framing Ross. Which is what pretty much everyone in these threads is doing.

That's absolutely horrible.

He acted on his own when he did that. Not as a government agent. He wasn't stealing in name of the FBI.

Don't you people ever get tired of this shit?
Also Ross admitted the murders for hire. He (through his lawyer) called it roleplaying. Why do you simply ignore this? Because he is your ancap hero perhaps?
