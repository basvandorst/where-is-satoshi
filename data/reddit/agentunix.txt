There was about six months where you could still buy BTC and withdraw that to your wallet or another exchange though...

Indeed. That pretty much covers it all. Fiat withdrawals being disabled should have been the first and only deal-breaker/red flag/convert-to-BTC-and-get-the-hell-out-of-there. For those that really didn't realize what was happening until the last moment - when ALL withdrawals were halted, it is certainly unfortunate, though. It's good to see so many people taking the time to question exchange practices and demand more streamlined ways of securing their coins, however. Multisig/Timelock should be standard and easy features for people to use, in my opinion. If we want mass adoption - wallet security needs to be top priority. And I know the features are already there, but not everyone has the knowledge to understand them, or the time to implement. It'll have to be simple for the average person. Understanding the power you have over your own funds is a shining feature of Cryptocurrency, but people will need to know their rights - before they can exercise them.
Also - Arbitrage, if it seems to good to be true... it is.

Does anyone use/trust the code in "QtBitcoinTrader/Qt OpenTrader" ( ?
Seems legit, though just want to make sure that this would indeed be the software to use for this... There are a lot of similar apps that are unsavoury. Obviously this thread demonstrates one perfectly. Excellent work, OP.

Hah ;)
Can't move those coins though...Genesis block coins are locked due to some odd code. Though some have sent "donations" to that address, they could be moved. Just not the original 50 BTC.

"I don't even sell or buy Bitcoins. I create physical encapsuler for physical cryptocurrencies..."
Not surprising... RBC is the worst. :/
The HSBC/JPM of Canada, if you know what I mean...
