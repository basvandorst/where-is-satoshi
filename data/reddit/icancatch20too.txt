If you get a 'fuck no' with one guess, but just a 'nope' with another, does that mean you're getting closer?
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:23:11
I went through the entire script copying and pasting phrases including this one, but I didn't include the period at the end.
@_date: 2016-08-29 02:47:23
Did you get it? Someone moved the coins. I'm dying to know the answer.
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:32:07
This is exactly what I did: 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:04:41
Awesome, I've been waiting for this.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:00:02
Wow you're so superior. You're probably also wrong. In order to drop 5.5k on btce you'd have to price it that low. This whale wanted out fast. 
EDIT: In case you weren't intelligent enough to realize.

Just imagine this through the eyes of the people in the developing countries where the phones were made. Smashing a $600 phone because the company won't allow an app for our internet money.
@_date: 2014-02-11 09:39:35
This is going to look much worse for us than Apple.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:35:44
Put the virtex address you sent it to after the forward slash to see what's going on 
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:00:53
Well 23 confirmations is more than enough. If everything looks good on the blockchain then it's probably just a processing issue with Virtex. I've had bitcoins missing for 12 hours but they always seem to show up eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:48:28
I highly doubt they're lost forever. They will show up eventually.
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:43:12
I hope you're not actually making financial decisions based on predictions from the Alex Jones show.

Stop. hates two things: memes, and beggars.

Stats 101, to be more accurate is to be less confident. He/she chose to be 100% confident (and 100% useless).
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:09:52
No there were comments too but I deleted them since everyone seemed quite content with being delusional. Plus, even that chart still shows a negative count to me.
EDIT: Now it's positive.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:51:37
This is what turns people off of a subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:45:23
Yeah OP, we're all losing money these past couple days now fuck off.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:39:35
Someone asked about this on the MtGox FB page and they said that it isn't strong enough.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:43:24
Yes, they would be gone forever.
@_date: 2013-03-22 06:33:09
We all know it. The trick is determining where exactly we are right now. Greed? delusion? Or right on the tip...
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:47:48
Maybe, or maybe it will go even higher. The only thing I'm certain of is that this is not the natural price.
@_date: 2013-01-27 02:25:23
Didn't Apple just recently pull a similar app from iTunes? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:44:47
After all that's happened, the price it's at right now is my break even point. I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just watch and laugh.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:19:04
With the crash? They failed to scale appropriately and didn't account for HFT which caused huge lag, which caused panic, which caused the initial crash. That's where they fit into the equation. Then they halted trading, which caused more anxiety. Then when they finally opened they were attacked. Every single thing that occurred leading to the current price revolved around MtGox. They weren't always to blame but they still had everything to do with it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:15:39
It annoys me that this article is actually pointing out the challenges we face, but everyone here is just dismissing it as another ignorant naysayer.
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:36:10
Yes, but bitcoin will struggle to compete against instantaneous transactions. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:15:07
gave a good explanation below if you haven't seen it yet.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:09:03
I upvoted this, because I'm the bigger man.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:29:48
Honestly, you'll make more by taking one can into a recycling depot.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:27:40
[This helps](
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:02:23
Where did it go man?
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:50:12
The trick to betsofbitco.in is to avoid ambiguity and poorly worded statements. I think this particular example was pretty clear, but there are some really bad ones out there.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:06:11
I made a small donation to satoshidice and will never go back. I also have some locked in at betsofbitco.in

If he's smart he'll reject it outright until the price stabilizes. It just fluctuated by $19 in under 2 minutes. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:44:27
You should see the address you sent it from and the number of confirmations.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:44:04
That's actually a really good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:07:52
Shit could be worse.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:09:07
I mostly agree with your points here. But your question of what MtGox has to do with the crash was pretty self explanatory.
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:16:15
Finally found? [betsofbitco.in]( has been around for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:02:58
1 BTC = 1 BTC and yet 1 BTC yesterday=/= 1 BTC today. You don't seem to get that part.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:01:30
Not this again.
@_date: 2013-03-24 07:55:42
Holy. shit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:24:34
Several groups and individuals from option 2.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:44:00
5 down votes in 6 minutes, the delusion phase is even evident on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:03:43
I prefer this subreddit after a crash. Capitulation is a humbling experience.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:45:49
I can tell you how a groundbreaking idea is not suppose to grow. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:39:27
The wind will blow it back at them?
@_date: 2013-03-30 07:52:33
There was a point last weekend where the price of bitcoin was jumping between 55 and 65 in fractions of a second, then a week later was at 94. This is too volatile to convince someone like tims to accept it. It's just not the right time. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:58:25
I didn't know what to expect one way or the other but my guess as to what their rational was would be that there is still a large verification queue at MtGox, and bank wire transfers don't go through over the weekend so people thought that with the new low price and influx of money to the exchanges on Monday the price would continue to rise.
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:39:20
No I think there were actually people who thought it would just rise forever. I mentioned the word bubble when the price was still at 75 and got downvoted so hard it still hurts.
