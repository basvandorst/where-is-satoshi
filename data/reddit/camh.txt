There is a sell order for ~20000 bitcoin (was ~25000) on bitstamp at $US300. The price cannot rise above that until that order is cancelled or those bitcoins are bought.
There appears to be enough buying demand to keep the price there. When that demand goes away, the price can drop back below 300 where that sell order will sit there unfilled until demand pushes the price back there.

How is it that such transactions enter the blockchain? Wouldn't the miners reject the transaction as invalid? Wouldn't the network (peers) reject a block that contained an invalid transaction.
Does the bitcoin mining software need to be stricter about what transactions it accepts?

Be careful buying Bitcoin in Australia. The purchase attracts GST, so if you were to purchase from overseas suppliers, you may be liable to pay the GST if you buy more than $A1000 worth (just as with any other goods purchased overseas).
I have no direct confirmation that this is the case or whether anyone has actually been charged GST in this circumstance, but I can see no reason why it would be excluded.
That Bitcoin purchases attract GST is stupid and I hope the tax office changes its ruling, but until it does, I'd be wary.
If you have specific evidence that I am wrong, please post it (and downvote this comment).

Right, but if there was not enough buying demand at 300, the price would drop and the price would not have flat-lined. And the question was about the flat-line. The flat-line is there because there is enough buying demand at 300.

Just keep your powder dry. Looks like you'll be able to buy lower still. A new 8-month low today.

What if it was anonymous currency and you thought you could get away with it? That's just stealing regular cash.
No, many people would not do it. Thankfully.

I thought a 51% attack would allow the attacker to double-spend coins. If that is the case, one of the people receiving a doubly-spent coin would lose it. No existing coins would be lost though.
