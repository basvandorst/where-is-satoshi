Buying and selling on coinbase locks in the price at the moment of transfer. It only takes a week to clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:27:07
Hmmm. Now you got me thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:07
GDAX crashed on me, it won't let me photo-verify my account, thus, I am stuck using coinbase for now. I'm still learning also.

Not much for in depth discussion..as far as the posts go. Comments are where you can at least find a bit of back and forth on the subject matter.

Just cashout until you're bitcoin levels are at a reasonable amount.

Surely, there must be some algorithm to follow that will take the random guess a tad less random.

I am a little cactus. You can do the thing.

I feel most of it is automatic. Sure, multi-millions of small transactions left unreported to the IRS but.. It's all logged under your name. And the trading websites  must report it legally. Must they report every small transaction maybe not but the large figures for sure.

Coinbase legally has to report millions of accounts that contain multifigure transactions to the IRS. [Source.]( This article was written two days ago. Where that non-taxable sweet spot is, (if it exists) I'm not sure of yet. I just know at the rate that bitcoin is going. I'm going to need to pay attention to my records. Taxes are better than fines/jail.

K, I'll put that in my calendar bro.

Seems we have an equal amount of naysayers in the msm. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:58:18
Good to know thanks. I'll have to look into this further. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:20:31
They're too busy tracking down the tax evaders.

Anyone predicting with educated guesses any upcoming dips? I thought for sure that btc would dip below $12k once it hit $12.5k. Guess not right now.

Reminds me of a technique some police use to catch potgrowers in apt buildings. They just look at the roof, the one with melted snow it the grower.

I was told it was backed by gold. So, I was told. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:44:00
It's at 14k. edit: it was a minute ago. I've never seen the price fluctuate so much on gdax in the past 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:20
You're..not wrong
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:31
Interesting. This subreddit is quite the echo chamber regardless of which side of the debate you are on. "If it's too good to be true.. "
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:59:40
Sounds... like tax evasion. I'm good. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:34:21
Log in to GDAX using your coinbase login. GDAX won't let me submit a verification photo so I'm stuck on coinbase. Apparently GDAX doesn't charge for buying and selling. I'd research further before trusting this comment because gdax doesn't even work for me yet.

Just face it. Electricity is being used by drug dealers and human traffickers. We need to ban electricity and go back to candles and torches like normal law abiding citizens would.

Same here. I've been reading about bitcoin since my first purchase. It's kind of cool that our purchase is already profitable and is continuing to rise. But never invest more than you can lose, as they say.
