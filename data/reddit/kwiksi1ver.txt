Your app should be on your iTunes backup and/or iCloud backup. Just re-download it from iCloud or reinstall it using iTunes.

Isn't there some way for a third party to pay the transaction/miner fee for a transaction? I swear I saw a service for this at one point.

As a long time reader of Tested, I think I am done with their site. The site has been slowly going downhill in terms of grabbing my interest. They usually research their articles quite well, and give well rounded opinion pieces. This video showcased a clearly drunk Will Smith, and an ignorant Norm reporting on something they clearly had not done research on. 
Could the ATM experience have been better? Sure. The KYC/AML laws suck, but to run a legit BTM in the US you have to do it. The reason his transaction took so long is because he didn't include a transaction fee. The fee is extremely tiny, and the fact the he *chose* not to pay it isn't anyones fault but his own. Should Robocoin have said, "Make sure you pay this fee if you don't want to wait forever"? Yes! 
Or could have built the transaction fee into their own already high fees? YES, YES, YES!
Are Will and Norm, and therefore Tested reporting on something they don't understand? Yes again. For a site that usually does their homework I find this to be pretty sloppy on their part. Even the follow up piece was pretty crappy.
I miss the pre-"Jamie and Adam" days of Tested.

Backup your apps in itunes (not icloud) and you won't lose your apps. Right click the phone in itunes and choose "Transfer Purchases". It'll take a while but it will save all of the apps from your phone to your computer. 
Then update your phone. I still have coinbase, blockchain, and coinjar on my phone after updating to 7.0.6.

I *think* he's referencing vPRO which in conjunction with a TPM chip on your mobo allows for alot of remote control of the board at the hardware level.

You should find some places in Indiana to get on board with this!

If it was off-the-cuff and wasn't up to par, it should not be located in one of their primary channels of communication. Perhaps Will or Norm's youtube channel would be more appropriate.
