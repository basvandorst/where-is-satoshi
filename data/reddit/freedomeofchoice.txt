I wish.  Since 10k such a big mental number ,as well as being the 200 MA on the daily, as well at 10.2 being the 20ma on the weekly, it will more than likely hit all that resistance and go back down before retesting it again later.  I will be selling most of my stock then and buying back at the dip.  The good news is the weekly and daily are still in uptrends.  There is also a chance it has gotten close enough that it is already going down before retesting.  I have been slowly selling on way up in case, as well as day trading during the daily up and downs for small profits.

Well there is always Mapquest for those who like to suffer and print them out lol.  I hate google but waze is great, just wish they never bought them.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:46:34
F**k Google. Duckduckgo unless you like being watched 24/7 and censored on searches.
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:06:26
yea google is like one big fricking cockroach, its everywhere and scurries around whenever caught, I mean questioned.  We are here should be pumping of bitchute instead for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:13:44
Spot on, human psychology and group think.
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:09:35
was never sold.  just disappeared after about 10 min.  Used as a wall to scare people who are looking at the book.  I think they are just trying to slowly buy more without it going up too fast.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:52:11
I would not complain as i am not a hodler.  That would be a quick almost 20%, then buy again once the next bounce occurs, or short on Kraken as it goes down again, possible on margin if the techs looks good enough.

Just more on overall weekly chart, the fear is still strong tho.  Books are only short term so doesn't  mean too much to me tbh and alot of trading is based too much on those.  Many of the sharks use them to manipulate the market with walls as you probably know, but if you watch they are generally fluid walls.  It is all about Greed and fear, we are still in fear phase but it can change quickly with the greed of low buyers.

True, it is all about percentages.  Long term trends override shorter in most cases, but this weekly bar will not be confirmed until Sunday, but considering the oversold market , the larger volume on today's up move, it is a calculated risk I am willing to take. As mentioned, it probably will retest the 50 especially after hitting the 20 ma on Daily where it is now.  Just offering my observations as a technical trader.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:34:59
Not systems, all charts and the market  is human buying and selling.  in large groups they are extremely predictable.  Not 100%, but way over 50%.  Sometimes charts have multiple time ranges saying the same thing like 3 weeks ago.  The hard part on trading is not the TA, it is resisting the emotion to sell when it goes lower and the urge to buy instead of sell when it get higher.  Basic fear and greed, and is why most people cannot use TA as they cannot overcome it.  In that case long term holding can be best as long as the investment is fundamentally good and researched.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:50:11
amen, that plus the 10.4 MA will definitely slow things down, will sell all at that point and then wait for another dip.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:25:03
Just regular TA, called it yesterday.  Should bounce back up from 8600-8700 but then will retest 9800 again and will see.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:54:50
Definitely last post on any TA in this sub filled with non-traders and kids.  So much ignorance on hows TA works.  It is not magic, it is percentages.  Keep t downvotes coming, they are like mana...
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:16:40
All posts before were future calls.  But just in case you really are asking: bounce off 8600-8700, then retest of 9800.  If passes 10k round # resistance, and more resistance at 10.4k.
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:02:47
Great question, gives me hope for this sub.  As you are probably aware, charts are basically maps of past human transaction whether it is in politics, trading, or another activity that can be tracked.  Just like presidential charts, the market always corrects itself eventually.  That of course doers not mean there is any guarantee of going back to ATH or ATL.  But it does show humans are very predictable in groups (not individuals).
I mention all this because the most common MA's are 20, 50, and 200.  This is followed IMO by 100 and maybe 5 and 10 for short term.  Because if this is is important to see what other traders see to try to get a consensus on any moves.  When I was trading futures, which are also 24/7, I never noticed much difference there with my MA's for example.  But I am always looking for a new angle and your MA's are interesting to add to charts to follow along.  It cannot hurt and possible and also confirm trends.  
I also trade gbth on my 401k which matches stock hours, but since it follows bit I don't pay as much attention to that chart and make by purchases on that from bit charts.

Oh you make me feel so good, yum yum.  The hate feeds my ego more than anything.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:39:12
yum yum!!

Actually on blackjack with counting 103%,. 95 out of 100 on slots ��
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:27:02
6600 to 7900, sell some, back down to 7300, buy some,  then up again ideally.  But just as likely likely is it will probably consolidate for a few days where it is now before doing anything.
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:55:27
looks like 6k to 6300
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:50:35
Looks like the daily resistance bounce down occurred already, will see if the doji stays today.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:25:51
Yes it does for my portfolio, have not ever been all in until 3weeks ago.  What is it about Redditors  always trying to pick apart people , don't know why I bother.  Just because you cannot separate investments does not change my all in for crypto, without the damn quotes.  
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:25:11
Actually some jobs do, have seen a few people mention that.  And it is called supply and demand, limited fixed supply means alot, unlike printed money which is constantly being printed and no longer backed by gold, just a promise.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:49:08
lol so much pessimism on this sub.  I have already unloaded 1/3.  9800 will unload another 1/3 min.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:11:02
Calulated risk and all in only on my designated crypto portfolio percentage
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:05:46
yea good thing you know so much.
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:04:10
Thanks, yea not too many real traders here lol
  Should have posted a meme instead,...  Been waiting for this for weeks.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:17:59
Spoken like the Truest of naive, kettle meet thyself.  Just because you do NOT know how to use TA does not mean it does not work.  I have traded for years using it. mostly futures which are also 24/7.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:34:45
Of course it does, CS's are just history and people in large groups are predictable.  Nothing different for Crytpo except a little more manipulation, but manipulation on orders is short term, almost impossible to maintain long term.   the 24/7 is similar to Futures which are also very CS friendly.
Do what you want, I just am recording this so everyone can Reddit REEEEEEE complain later if I am wrong, lol.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:01:36
Next Stall around 9800, will sell 1/3 min then, probably a half.  This is daily 200 so a big Resistance.  Next after that around 10.4K.  Ideally will sell at 9800, but some on pullback, then see what happens again.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:31:50
Yes saw the same thing, that is why i try to ignore these days. Had one Sell order for 7000 units, disappeared after 5 minutes.
