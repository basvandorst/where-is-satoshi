Trezor uses 12/24 word seeds with 4 letter words as a standard - Nano uses words with &lt; 8 letters. On top with Trezor there were recent security issues like the following:

Anyway the fact that it was that easy to get access doesn't give me faith in TREZOR.

Seems this dude hasn't really took the time to examine the individual cases? The last one he is talking about was due to a fishing attack involving a fake URL.

Nano S - more coins that are supported, more secure (more secure chip, better seed etc.) and larger community!

True, but it doesn't help Bitcoin to provoke constantly. What Bitcoin needs now is adoption in stores, otherwise it is more gold than a currency.

You don't get the point, don't you?

Not a single post will cause fear but the constant propagation that Bitcoin may destroy central banks will. Especially if people create stupid pictures that are exhibited publicly.

Dafür ist es extrem teuer zu nutzen! Unattraktive Kurse und Fees.

The more you come up with shit like this and the more you make the FED and others fear you the more they will do to destroy/regulate Bitcoin. There is simply no need in posting stuff like this, support Bitcoin by increase its adoption instead.

Not true, while there is an increase in supply due to newly mined bitcoins, the number of incremental bitcoins that are effectively locked up forever is also increasing.

Market manipulation at its best! Wondering why nobody has triggered an investigation so far?

People always seem to forget that they are comparing two different things! You cannot compare a stocklisted company's market cap with soon-to-be Fiat!

Don't think we have a bubble yet, maybe in a year from now - but today the mainstream media coverage is scarce, professional investment vehicles aren't involved (ETFs, Hedgefonds, FX Traders), majority of people haven't heard of anything beyond Bitcoin.

Sure, DEX is always a good idea but there are already good ones out there! -&gt; BITSHARES

Have a look at NEO; they pay out Gas, which is equal to Ethereum and thus of value itself.

Better have a lesser share of something growing than of something than won't reach mainstream due to technical shortcomings!

Don't think we are in a bubble, I know hardly anyone who has invested in crypto. Large investment vehicles are nowhere and people mainly focus on Bitcoin or Ethereum lately, there is much room to grow. I understand and respect your reasons but I think the value will be higher in a few years from now.
