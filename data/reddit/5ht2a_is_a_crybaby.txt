I just sold my bitcoin yesterday and put it all into ethereum. Only to see today's BTC price!!!
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:18:42
I'm gonna go with a dip. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:32:22
I might sell when it hits 300 and make a few bucks. Hopefully BTC dips again and I can buy in. Or maybe buy BTC high.

I'm gonna be watching my live ticker for the rest of the night. I'm predicting it won't go above $3000 for a while.

Right. I've done quite a few transfers. But I've made enough profits to cover all of it. Haven't lost a dollar of my initial investment. I got in ETH at 150. I'm gonna stop that, though, because I have more money to hold now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:25:21
I know. Most of my profits were coming from my $10 stake in ETH. I actually didn't lose any money, even with all of the fees. So I'm not too worried. Just gonna watch the dip/not dip tonight and see where I should go. Haven't lost a dollar of my initial investment, yet.

Yeah, I'm actually like $7 up on a $75 investment in ETH over like a week or something. And that's with every fee. Gonna head over to the ETH subreddit now lol.

Thanks. I've made enough money in it that I've switched my money around so much between ETH and BTC but I still have the same amount I put in. So that was kind of fun. I only have $70 in but I just put it all back into bitcoin. 
To 4000!

Should I get all of my money out of ETH and put it all into BTC??? Help!!
