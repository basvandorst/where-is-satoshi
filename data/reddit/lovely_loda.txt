\&gt; Not a single one of those issues exists here  
High fees are an issue everywhere. If paypal is just using  to pay $ to merchants then fees aren't shown explicitly. Merchant will still be paying paypal, and guess where would that come from.
Currency conversion rate issues are again everywhere. US dollar is strong relative to other currencies, so it may not be noticeable.
Note that for handing credit cards like candy, makes US an exception.  some of your financial woes can be traced back to this. Also paypal being an american thing is naturally going to be US friendly, so it works with cards present there, does NOT share transaction info with other govts \(which is why my govt has banned people from using their paypal funds to transact online\)

1\) Requires specific debit/Credit cards: Paying via Paypal requires a specific type of credit card \(where I live, pretty sure debit card was not supported\) , which is HUGE bottleneck. many including, yours truly don't have a credit card. Bitcoin is literally the only option to pay for international websites \(domain/hosting\) 
2\) FEES: 4&amp; just to transfer from paypal to bank. Seller has to pay similar fees to send to my paypal.
3\) Local restrictions: Where I live, funds in paypal CANNOT be used to pay online.  funds received only go  the attached bank account.
4\) Credit card / banking penetration is SUPER LOW in most parts of the world. Making online payments via paypal like solution is out of reach. To 'transact' with Bitcoin,  a mobile phone is needed. That. is. it.
5\) Strange paypal currency conversion rate. Paypal/Other centrally controlled entity, can and has increased Fees for no apparent reason \(other than greed\)

We want positive people, not negative - classic tactic in bullshit cults .   
Heard a lot of it in reiki 'classes' . Don't listen to people with negative views. Reiki is all about positive.

Dude, maybe I didn't explain myself clearly, but you  completely missed the point.
All I am saying is that those who don't really understand bitcoin and all its complexities should not be part of the debate. I am not suggesting anything about any side.

From the same guy:


Speaking in the Lok Sabha (parliament) on the supplementary demands for grants, Somaiya said: “The prediction that Nostradamus made that a leader will emerge in the east, and will take India to new heights, Modi is that leader.”
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:48:05


Completely agreed for the 'global' part; and for large amounts.  
HOWEVER, most txs are not global and of low value (in terms of $)  
Example costs in India:   
- Cost for eating in a decent restaurant is about 
3$/person  
- A snack at the local subway = 0.5$  
- hair cut : 1.3$  
- private transport (taxi) for 20Km = 4-5$
People are already using mobile payment wallets instead of cash for making these payments. 
NOT taking any sides, Just a FYI
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:01:35
Good question (if this is indeed the case).
hobbist'ish guess:  Maybe this will make it easier for people to run nodes, helping making bitcoin more decentralized ?

NO. 
There is only 1 Bitcoin ; BTC for short.
'Bitcoin' name isn't under any copyright afaik.   
It is being abused to profit by confusing people  via creating these alternative scam cryptocurrencies.  
Example of these scam coins:   
'bitcoin cash' , 'bitcoin gold' 'bitconnect' 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:19:18


Bullshit. Both are NOT bitcoin.   
BTC is bitcoin.   
BCH is bitcoin cash - (separate from bitcoin)

Hiding behind 'legality' does not stop a fraud from being a fraud.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:56:13
NOPE. The site got the numbers and math wrong! 
    
     1 bitcoin = 100 000 000 satoshi
Thats 10 to the power of 8 [Source](
Since 1 BTC is apprx  5 00 000  INR  
1 satoshi is  INR 500000/100000000  
OR    
  .005 INR

Bitcoin is fantastic for international transfers:
- no banking hours  
- no approval needed for cards. No id required.
- insignificant fees  
 
Ensure coins are going to the intended recipients:  
Right now in India if  100 units are allocated for a project, say for providing food to the poorest. Only about 20 units actually reach them. The rest is gobbled by the corrupt. 
In addition many many rural people don't receive govt benefits because they don't even know their birthdate let alone have an ID! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:46:25
Read the wikipedia article about the word dollar before comparing it with bitcoin.


The point here is not of which is the 'real' bitcoin, but that bitcoin cash is deliberately trying to hijack the and ride the 'bitcoin' name.  
ffs stop living in fairy land 


Why stop there ? bitconnect, bitcoin dark, bitcoin dick super edition . should all be called bitcoin.

And have they given any measurements , from BCH to Bitcoin ? NO . USD is used as the measurement unit.

Depends on what is meant by 'password'. It could refer to:
1. Password of hidden(encrypted) wallet file.
2. password of unencrypted wallet.
3. The 'actual' private keys - A line of letters/numbers. Also known in Human readable form as 'SEED'.
The SEED CAN recover all bitcoins in case of deterministic wallets(many if not all wallets these days afaik).  
If only encrypted wallet file is backed up without the password and you don't have the SEED, the bitcoins are lost.
Never leave any wallet file unencrypted  (case 2).
TLDR: backup seed of bitcoins in a safe safe location.
