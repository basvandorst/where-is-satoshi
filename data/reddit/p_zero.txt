The article mentions 5 reasons, but only gives two real arguments: "Secure Element (SE) is not open-source" &amp; "because SE is widely used, it will increasingly attract the attention of hackers". 
Trezor also runs its own closed source microprocessor chip (and firmware?) and their hardware is used to protect hundreds of millions of dollars - placing them in the same position. Moreover, the bandwagen risk works both ways - it also increases security focus, not only attracts hackers.
Sidenote: the hack referred to at point 4 is a new form of ATM skimmer (called a shimmer), not a direct hack of SE itself. 
Then they close their article with "we at SatoshiLabs remain skeptical about the use of Secure Elements as a guarantee for security". They of all people should know there's no such thing as guaranteed security, the best security is focused on minimizing damages when inevitable breaches happen. 
Lastly with their statements "Granted, SE is widely used in the banking sector." &amp; "The added security may not really be that significant" they themselves shed much doubt on their entire point of view.

Unless I'm misunderstanding you, it's right under the "Markets" dropdown:  . 
I'm using the site daily and from my experience they update quickly, Coinbase was on there since day 1. Bitstamp removed right after the hack in January (guess the owner had some funds there), etc.

Ah, I see. There's a reference to this from Bitcoinwisdom on Bitcointalk from February, so I guess it's poorly updated indeed-  . 
(Un)fortunately I still prefer their UI / TA tools over others such as Tradeblock and Cryptowatch.
