If it we don't see much buy volumns in the next few days, we might see it dip down to the 6000s.

If it breaks the 10k support, it's possible that it'll go to 6-8k. But don't worry, we are here for the long run. These "crashes" happen so often now.

I just sold half of my btc. A part of it went to altcoins, and the rest is now in USD.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:58:59
The days when bitcoin was $10,869

I was literally debating if I should add guac on chipotle bowl today for that extra 1.50... when yesterday I dropped $4000 on Bitcoins.

I missed the last dip too. I had funding problems with the exchange I use :(  Yea it's crazy today! I think I'm gonna buy a portion now, and hope for a drop coming in the next few days.

Personally I don’t think it’ll dip any time soon. I pretty depressed cuz I didn’t buy any on the last dip. So I’m really hoping for a dip down to 6500 possibly soon...

Or just 2 months ago... It was half of what it is right now.

Please don’t.

Thanks, I will look into a secure wallet.

I use QuadrigaCX, funding is cheaper than Coinbase, withdraw is free. The only issue for me with QCX is that the bank wire option (no fees) is unavailable now, so I cannot fund a large amount without paying an absurd amount of fees.

Don’t have any experience with BTM, but i bought some with Gemini recently, and it was satisfied with the process. I’m in Surrey, I bank with RBC. I signed up to Gemini, it took 10 hours to get verified. Then I exchanged my CAD money to USD using KnightsBridgeFX, it took two days for the exchange to take place and I got my usd in my rbc usd chequing account. Then I went to the RBC to do a wire transfer of the USD to Gemini. Two hours after walking out the bank, my account was funded and I was able to buy bitcoins. Gemini charges 0.25% transaction fee, which is much lower than most other exchanges. Everything went smoothly, the whole process was under 3 days.

Definitely over 9000.

Roughly 15-30 minutes if you pay higher fees. If you choose to pay lower fees to the miners, it could take hours.

I think so too. It will likely go below the previous bottom at 5k. My guess is in the range of 4-5k. I’m pretty happy I sold at 9.6k two days ago. Planning to buy it back once it goes below 5k.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:05:11
20 minutes, $12 fee.
