I agree that quotes moving to µBTC would make it more palpable to the general public, it will be interesting to see how the huge surge in price has forced more mainstream coverage.

I completely understand that, but BTC seems to be hitting an inflection point of sorts where people that don't fully understand it want to dip their toes in the water.  It's probably safe to say for most people buying BTC would be unlike any other sort of investment or security purchase your average individual has experience with.

Yes but BRK.A had fundamentals you could derive implied value from and limited ownership to primarily institutions (granted BTC is much different in that it is a currency and can be bought fractionally).

I can understand that, but I guess my question is more in regard to those that are new to the currency.  If the price of 1 BTC shot to 10k, there would likely be some that don't feel comfortable buying what would feel like such a small amount of a currency. 
A better example would be BRK.A and BRK.B in the markets, one feels much more accessible to non institutional investors.

I think that's fair especially given the price volatility and would probably be for the best.

A couple things:
BRK is a stock that you can reasonably derive a fair price of using comps from the underlying fundamentals, BTC is a currency. 
My question is more about the psychological effect of it feeling better to own 10 of something than 1 of something.
