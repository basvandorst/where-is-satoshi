If the internet is a country, bitcoin would be its currency. 
In my opinion it makes more sense to market bitcoin that way.
Italy or any other country will never adopt bitcoin fully. In that case residents would not call them self any more italians nor there would be a state of italy... they would be already recognized as people from planet earth.

Nxt has the same feature since ages... its called token. You can verify that you have a account and also insert messages. You can use it the same as "sign in with facebook" for example. GPG does this also since 4ever, so its not really mind breaking.

Almost one year back i was happy to buy even something with bitcoin. So in this time i spend my bitcoins on goods and services. I was happy till the moment i realized you dont save anything. Anyone wants to charge you extra for using it. As a consumer you cant win at this moment in time. If a shop gives you even a high discount using bitcoin you can be sure they converting to FIAT. People that converting monthly a part of there wages to bitcoin are the losers, the pressure of miners, speculators, merchants is becoming incredible high. Bitcoin is the greatest invention since the internet, but the normal joe just cant benefit from it yet. When i go to the payment site i always think twice now... pay with FIAT or Bitcoin.

Doesn't matter free market will decide and it will not be bitcoin because the algorythm is to expensive. We will probably see mainstream using something similar to bitsharesx. Mix between centralisation and decentralisation. Proof of work failed at the moment when wallet, miner and node were seperated, before it was a fine thing. Now its just a broken system.

The market isnt just that big. Btce has always around 1500 users online and reddit 1000 or less. Bitcoin is like a small town and alt coins are like villages. Bitcoin is a online currency... so thats not a lot. Most poker sites have more traffic. Now you can say there are people owning bitcoin without using reddit. sure... Bitcointalk has around 375000 members and 70 % are probably socket puppets. So enough space for growing in the future.

That sometimes the problem in crypto... its wild west. The right step for bter would be to enforce the law to begin with. If the hacker wanted to check only a security loop he should get a bounty but he really tried to steal it and thats a crime. He still has a large amount bitcoin and nxt that customers owned. Who can be sure that bter not used customer bitcoin to pay him?

Fun fact is if a lot of people buy a trezor today. Trezor is converting to dollar with bitstamp. When your device is finally delivered your bitcoins are worth even less. No need to super secure them anymore.
Im a crypto hardliner but this is really getting nonsense, all coins are hot potatoes only useful as payment network not long time holding as long as no one truly accepts bitcoin etc...
Trezor can have my dollars but not my bitcoins they dont deserve them.

Good luck. From technical part speaking counterparty is way behind bitshares and Nxt. Just also have a look at nxt multigateway... What does make Storjcoin a more well known asset than Nem? We will see which one will outperform more. Counterparty is doomed to fail as a on top of bitcoin solution. 
They are all on there. 
Just vote me down but Nxt is the only coin out there decoupled from bitcoin. Bitcoin investors are stuck in 2009. Counterparty would be great as a standalone...

@_date: 2014-10-09 13:39:28
How are they moved offchain? Did i say something about bitfenix specific? I talk about all exchanges. Trading thin air is every buy and sell in a exchange because its most likely offchain. People here think they dont make the same mistakes than the generation before. The inventor of the credit card thought also he would change the world... he did... If bitcoin will become mainstream thin air trading will be becoming the average because there is only limited supply. In case of bitfenix do you think they do a useful service for bitcoin? They make bitcoin more interesting for speculators but not to the average user. They are one of the cause for large volatility(flash chrashes). Im not surprised about the down votes because the 1000 users online are mostly speculators.

Bitcoin the currency will only survive if they hard fork to a asic resistant or proof of stake algorithm. The model did stop working when the average geek could not mine any bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:45:54
Lol did one of you read the whitepaper. Step 1 you have to reinforce that everyone is a miner(node), litecoin and vertcoin wasnt asic resistant. With the first step you solve already most of the problem. Did anyone see the mining difficulty chart? The price bubble is a joke against this. If this thing will be over no one wants to hear the word mining anymore. Who do you think bought asics in the first place and profit on it(early adapters)? Dont forget this is technology not gold.

Thats just a total waste of resources... they should focus to enable distributed computing with the mining power.

The problem is china doesnt contribute anything to the bitcoin ecosystem expect of fake volume and fake trezors.
I met in my holiday a real chinese guy(not hong kong), he said to me how can you like china we steal everything from you. Worked for you pretty good i told him.

The act of sitting on substantial wealth reserves with no intention and/or ready method by which to exchange it for goods and services. A reference to the dragon named "Smaug" from J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit" who acquires and obsesses over vast treasure reserves yet has no way or desire to spend or trade them.
Used to refer to members of the Bitcoin community who have acquired large stores of bitcoins yet few outlets by which to spend them for things that they might want. Sam says he is totally smauging on his Bitcoin stash until he can buy a new house with it.

Did run a bitcoin node and several different altcoin nodes. Stopped the bitcoin node because people in became to hostile against other open source projects.
Would be no problem to host a bitcoin node on one machine with several other projects such as nxt and ethereum, everyone would be happy.
@_date: 2015-10-28 14:47:22
centralisation! xD it would be better to have 100 people setting up 1 node each!

Altcoins exist for one reason diversity. Im happy that i dont have to wear the same shoes as everyone else. Mostly everything in the world is a pyramid scheme, you stop calling them like this when they get big enough. Just think about your company you work for... 
The way treats other opensource projects like ethereum and Nxt disgusts me, i sometimes even think about to shutdown my bitcoin node. Most people in Bitcoin think they are open minded, they are not!

Satoshi already had a solution, client =&gt; full node &amp; miner =&gt; reward. Bitcoin core devs destroyed satoshis work when they separated them. No wonder he left. The joke is one of the smartest guys around crypto is doing it again with ethereum. They become one again.... only greed was splitting them...

To be fair ethereum will be for smart contracts what bootstrap is in web development. Cunterparty devs have no long term goals they jump from one project into the next one to make a quick bug. A parasite on top of bitcoin with ethereum repo.

You must be on the wrong comment or topic? Every user(client) used to be a miner and a node at the same time and took a reward for that service. Is this the case in bitcoin anymore? Did you ever read the whitepaper? There is no reward running a full node anymore. Did you ever run bitcoin client in 2010?
