Is running a node part of keeping Bitcoin safe? I thought it was just part of the transactions process .

just looking for opinions, stay calm
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:59:45
Thanks for the response. I have looked up futures and I'm still confused about what they are, and what Bitcoin futures means for Bitcoin core. Can you do a quick eli5? It'd be really appreciated
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:50:16
But it's so satisfying 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:52:43
I'm looking to put in more money, I hope this comes crashing down for a bit 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:33
If it goes as high up as some people are speculating, the few thousand you lose on the dip really won't mean all that much I don't think. That's the dream anyway 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:47:41
Look into commodity trading. Im not 100% what it means and my explanation will be confusing I'm sure.

Mind explaining the deflationary concept a wee bit?

Etherium sounds like it'll be the first to use the block chain technology outside of just transferring currency, or will be the first for "smart transactions", with the writing code with contracts, that is etherium, right?  What is it about eth you don't like? That sounds like it'll be groundbreaking to me

And say litecoin does take over, is there a place for Bitcoin? Or is it like Walmart putting Kmart out if business?

Does that exchange lock in a price for you when you go to sell? I tried selling and lost money cause I couldn't input the sell price and click accept fast enough, so frustrating. How do you get around that ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:50
So still wonky?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:05:35
It uses gas, which I'm really not sure what it is, I guess like Satoshis to the btc. And its supposed to be a good way to make some money, but I could never get a second transaction through to breed my first cat. So I'm sitting on a 25 dollar crapily drawn cartoon cat.... I'll be trying to play it again tomorrow though
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:14
You really think it'll get back that low though?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:26:07
It will fall, when people decide Bitcoin is worth more. In the end, it's humans that gave gold it's worth, and so it is with Bitcoin.

I've spent 20ish bucks on a cat, wanted to play the game, make some money... But every time I went to get another cat, the transaction failed or just kept pending. Very frustrating. Are the servers still clogged up?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:25
That sounds reasonable. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:17
I'm not sure. What happened today was definitely the whales coming in,  but it didn't come back down too hard for too long, it got back to 17 pretty quick. I think (I hope) the new investors see not to sell, someone had to have told them there will be dips, some bigger than others. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:49:21
If you take out, you have less Satoshi to make you money in the future. Hodl unless you really need that money, or you see another smart investment.

It's clearly the index finger pointing to the moon 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:23:40
You heard anything good about litecoin? I was hearing that should be the next coin to blow up, or is that what all alt coin people think about "their" coin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:25:06
Even 1k in lite?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:19:38
Perfect 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:20:21
So litecoin all the way?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:18:09
500k - 1millionish?
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:27:32
Until you lose it or get it stolen. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:31:34
Until it gets cheap enough people start mining again and the cycle starts again 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:40:29
If you were a miner with common sense, you'd shut down when you were taking losses, not wait 5 years. And you'd start up again when it became profitable. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:42:14
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:34:54
Anyone who owns a miner will inevitably start it up when the price is right. What that is I have no idea, but if you owned one or two or a hundred, would you call it quits? Or just wait till the time is right?
