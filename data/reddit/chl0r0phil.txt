Your response only makes sense if adoption remains the same, but falls apart if adoption continues to increase until Bitcoin becomes the global reserve currency, in which case, my arguments are all valid...

Hey Captain Boufles! It seems like China is attacking Bitcoin mining on all fronts at the moment:  
Great! Let renewables compete fairly with coal (they're now cheaper than coal). Additionally, I clearly stated in the article that I was talking about non-subsidized electricity when comparing the costs. Reading comprehension can be pretty tough though! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:23:15
TL;DR - Bitcoin is good for the environment for these reasons (in order of importance IMO) 
1. Bitcoin makes consumerism too expensive by being deflationary
2. Bitcoin has an orders of magnitude smaller environmental footprint than printed money and banking
3. Bitcoin mining encourages the switch to cheaper electricity, which at the moment is renewable energy
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:59:06
Here you go:  
For your future research, I was able to find it by typing "cheapest energy source" into Google. Oh, hey! The article mentions that storing the excess electricity is a problem for renewables. I wonder if mining Bitcoin could help with that issue and drive the price of renewables even lower?

Short-term pain for long-term gain? How much do you care about the environment?

Fiat currencies \- easily inflatable by central banks/governments and out of your control.
"Cryptocurrencies \-" Even easier than fiat to "print" a new altcoin network thanks to Bitcoin's innovation. Nobody can force you to use a new alt coin, but nobody can prevent their creation. It is your choice to reject the new networks because funding them is giving them value, perpetuating the idea that money creation is valuable \(I think it's unnecessary now that we have Bitcoin\).
Bitcoin \- Nearly impossible to inflate, and doing so would require your explicit permission.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:13:25
What I'm arguing is that accepting another coin is just perpetuating the idea of monetary inflation, because there can be an infinite number of newly created alt coin networks while there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins.

I don't think it's possible to "manipulate" Bitcoin in a traditional sense. Anyone can buy and sell Bitcoin, changing the overall price of it in reference to other currencies, but nobody can manipulate Bitcoin itself by printing more of them or counterfeiting them. Everyone participates with the exact same rules. Nobody can force you to spend your Bitcoin and it has 0 inflation, so HODLing is the best way to beat whales buying and selling large amounts of Bitcoin. Each Satoshi you own is one fewer satoshi anyone else can possibly have.

My second assumption in the article is that a country is NOT its government. Patriotism is not allegiance to your government, it's allegiance to the land and people in your culture.

Agreed! I drafted this article on Monday, then heard him on Tales from the Crypt yesterday and had to reach out. He was kind enough to provide me with some feedback about the article.

The whole point of the article is that **ignoring Bitcoin** **is giving other people around the world the opportunity to make you poorer,** an opportunity that they have been jumping on for 10 years. Skip boozing for a week, put $20-$100 into BTC, forget about it and continue paying rent in whichever other currency you want, and you're protected.

We're currently seeing the opposite of what you're saying with both forms of centralization. Right now, less than .5% of the world's population has *any* amount of Bitcoin. When a new person gets some, it is decreasing the centralization and hodlings of older users. What we're more likely to see with mining is that it becomes a standard part of renewable energy production to offset the cost of surplus energy. We're already seeing it start to trend that direction with Bitmain getting completely slapped by the market for attempting to centralize mining.

You're making the arguments I responded to in the article. Please give at least argument 2 a read for your own good.

Yeah, this is what I'm saying. You're making argument 2 of the article, that I'm an unstable piece of shit who clearly has no idea what I'm talking about. Read the response, bruh.

Bitcoin's issuance schedule is different than inflation in my opinion. At any given time, the market has a completely accurate view of the supply of Bitcoin, and everyone can operate under the assumption that there will never be more than 21 million. With true inflation, it is very difficult to impossible to get an accurate view of exactly how much supply is available. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:03:57
Haha, Exactly! The Black hole is tiny, but it's slowly growing in size and gravitational pull. The larger it gets, the more gravity it has. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:23:00
So, you're saying what we know for certain is a hopelessly optimistic view of supply and that it is likely more scarce than we can predict?
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:07:11
The markets in Colombia don't seem to think it's a problem, and this article assumes that miners are producing Bitcoin, when it's the opposite. All Bitcoins have been created, and they are released to miners as a reward for securing the network. When the subsidy ends, securing the network is likely to become defensive and not necessarily remain a specific industry. It'll likely just be a part of renewable energy production to offset the cost of surplus energy as chips get less expensive and incurring electricity costs becomes unprofitable for mining.

You're making argument 2 in the article. I recommend you read my response. It may end up saving you from yourself and your dumbass opinions.

I appreciate the thoughtful, well argued critique of 2 sentences of my thousand word article, anonymous internet user. Luckily for both of us, our intentions, thoughts and opinions don't mean shit! 
Were you able to make it to the objective data part of the article, or were your sensibilities too offended to make it past this point? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:28:04
There are pros and cons to claiming your forked coins. For me, I view them as occasional paychecks, and an additional 1-3% BTC is worth it for me to rework my security system. For newer folks, 1-3% might not be worth the risk. Once you know how to do it and get comfortable with the process, it's really only about 30 minutes worth of actual work, and then possibly a few hours of waiting for altcoin blocks to be confirmed.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:31:37
Only if the exchange grants you access to the coins. If you don't control your private keys, it's not really your bitcoin. Get Samourai wallet and take your coins off of the exchanges unless you're day trading. My Bitcoin never touches exchanges. I exclusively use exchanges for altcoin dumping.

Yeah, I have the 12 word private key stored safely. I am more curious about the digital vulnerabilities of keeping it on a USB drive running TAILS. How can it get hacked? Some of the answers below mention hardware keyloggers. Anything else that could be insecure about TAILS?

I think it was Gandhi who once said "write the article you want to see in the world."  You should write something on the topic! The point of my article was to address the concerns about inflating the supply of Bitcoin via consensus, which seems supremely unlikely for the reasons I outlined.

@_date: 2018-12-28 20:01:40
Thank you! I don't necessarily think it's unlikely that a future inflation bug will be found, but I think that it is unlikely that the bug would gain enough consensus to permanently inflate the supply.  It's more likely to spawn another fork - "Bitcoin Inflation," or "Bitcoin Crappy Hard-currency" (BCH for short) 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:48:02
Part of the genius of this invention is that Bitcoin hacks human greed to enact an immense amount of positive change for the world. In Bitcoin, the best thing you can do is look out for yourself by HODLing and introducing new people to Bitcoin. ~~Giving nothing is completely wrong. HODLing requires incredible patience. For example, I am giving you an opportunity to learn something for free, and you are misleading people and wasting my time. The amount of effort I'm inputting into Bitcoin's growth is exponentially higher than the amount of effort required for you to trash it.~~
Edit: My knowledge of 300 quotes is lacking, and my Troll radar is too sensitive. HODL strong my friends
