I was doing some analysis of BTC and the pricing in Venezuela until I came across this post. I am American, so please excuse my ignorance. Based on the image you provided, 1 BTC is going for roughly 97,000 VEF (Bolivar)? If that's the case, then my assumption of the Venezuelan black market rate was way off. I assumed that 1 USD would get 200 VEF in the black market; at that rate, 1 BTC would go for roughly 50,000 VEF. So that means the black market rate (USD/VEF) is more along the lines of 400 VEF.

But btcparaleo.com ONLY gives the official rate for BTC/USD, but gives the black market rate for the BTC/VEF. I think that is being somewhat  disingenuous. It should either provide the official rates or the black market rates for all conversions. But I know how crazy it is

I like your point in how we have the opportunity to gain a piece of this great network and all of the progress it endures just by owning bitcoin. I think people fail to see this.
One thing I would add: think of being able to buy a piece of Email in 1993 (1/21 millionth of the network). Now think of the value that share of ownership would be today. I TRULY believe bitcoin will surpass that valuation. I circle-jerk you not.

"Bernanke, meanwhile, said the potential for bitcoin to be used to fund illegal activities means it would probably result in regulators shutting it down if its use became widespread."

With regard to your point on Ledger, it might make sense to use it strictly as a long-term cold storage option where you won't be sending Bitcoin out any time soon.

Bitcoin is probably one of the most interesting innovations of our time (in my opinion). If you would like to learn about bitcoin, go to YouTube and watch every single video you can find. To invest, I would suggest going to Coinbase.com and setting up an account - you will be able to connect your bank account with them and exchange money for bitcoin. Coinbase is a very simple service to use. As for mining, don't even waste your time thinking about it, and I'm serious when I say that. It is too specialized for individuals at this time. Also, keep following the Bitcoin subreddit! 
We will all be learning each and every day together. Cheers!

I think once you get a solid understanding of cold storage versus warm storage, then the concept will be clear. I think paper cold storage is a good idea for storage. My suggestion is to laminate the paper wallet because paper might deteriorate over time. To buy Bitcoin, go to Coinbase (dot) com and set up an account. Think of Coinbase as a bitcoin bank - you will be able to purchase bitcoin from them and store them in your account. You will have to have a bank account to connect with Coinbase in order to purchase bitcoin from them. Coinbase can also be thought of as a "warm wallet". Once you purchase bitcoin from Coinbase, you can send it to a "cold" wallet (i.e. paper wallet) for safe keeping. However keep in mind, if you are going to spend those Bitcoin soon, then you would probably want to keep it in Coinbase. (I will get hammered here for tell you to keep your coins with Coinbase, but they are a pretty good service  for when you are starting out). Also, you can generate paper wallets in Coinbase, but I would use bitaddress.org instead for generating paper wallets. 
I hope the weather isn't too bad in the GB. Cheers!

I have been doing the same calculations, and I arrive at a similar conclusion. In order to gauge the value of BTC in VEF and USD, I track both the official and black market rates of these currencies. The way I track the black market rate is  and Localbitcoins Venezuela. The going rate for 1 BTC right now is roughly 124,000 VEF.
