Include live price in the home page with charts and break downs. Price is a important factor and how most people reference bitcoin with. 
With so many coins starting with bitcoin ( bitcoin cash , bitcoin gold etc) , we want the home page to give people this is the original bitcoin feeling.(referencing satoshi, his white paper, history of forks...etc) 
Also all 3 designs give a ‘cute’ feeling but I don’t consider bitcoin cute in anyway. When i think of bitcoin , i think of ‘innovated, violated, decentralized, technology driven’. These designs are nice but have no soul of bitcoin. 
Its easier to say than to be done, but this is how i feel about the designs.

Every country does have different means of oppressing their citizens, however China is different. 
They brainwash starting in elementary school which they even have a subject called 'Thinking and Morality' that teaches you the 'right' way to think. 
They can make you disappear. Friend disappeared for 6 days locked and questioned in a small room since she had conflicts with the locals(didn't bribe enough) and was back stabbed. No one knew where she was or where she went during that 6 days.
They will take the business if it grows too big (Alipay)
Giving 'use bitcoin to illegally move their funds' as the banning reason is like saying ' banning cars because it helps criminal escape.'  There is always people using bitcoin or any currency illegally in every country but that is just the small portion. 
Talking about corrupt, Chinese government is also pretty corrupt itself.
