Damn. He would have walked away easily if he had that now. Would have just been a fine. Poor guy

I hope you implement more payment options. But congratulations on your new bar. I wish you all the success in the world!

I used to buy and SELL at least 70 BTC a month back in 2013. Wish I could go back in time and tell myself to HODL. But hindsight is 20/20 I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:05:10
I know right. Before ASICs became the norm. And banks started highjacking what crypto was supposed to be,  fuck it.  might as well cash up as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:50:41
My wife seems to be okay with me using our tax return this coming year on crypto. She knows that I've been trading crypto since 2012 and she looks at me every time she sees the news. I fucked up too my friend. Lol. Good luck on your investment buddy. I wanna get a boat :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:37:59
Ahahahah. Looks like Turkey is gonna be pist at me for mining. I'm like a drug peddler to them now I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:33:35
Pretty Cool OP. I'm looking at getting one, I just started mining Ethereum myself, once I get to a few hundred in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:45:42
That's what I'm talking about!
I think Ether is gonna gain alot more then the BTC jump that happened this year.

Remeber. Any freedom is illegal 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:50:31
I was talking about the fiat conversion price of value. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:34:03
Hmmm. Well I'm using 4 wallets right now. But I should look into a paper one. Maybe once I can figure out how to memorize what I need to know, I wouldn't mind throwing most of them in it and keeping one of my exchange wallets 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:20:18
Haha. I found an email for around 2012 that had an old wallet. I looked at it and just shook my head. I do plan on buying a ledger wallet soon, so I'm less tempted to wanna fuck with it. Out of sight, out of mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:32:38
I know. Still shooting myself in the foot every time I see the price on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:14:48
I was looking at just one of my many many BTC wallets. I think one of them had 14 transactions with over 350 BTC. If only I held. Lol. But I always say, it wouldn't have gotten as big as it is now if it was just us playing with it. I've made my angry regretful peace with it. Lol. But I'm not gonna make that mistake again. HODL til my account looks like a phone number :)!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:27:05
To be honest, I don't trust paper wallets for some reason. I plan on having maybe 2 or more separate wallets just in case of a hacking or something. I've gotten more paranoid about crypto hacks since it started becoming more known and the prices started skyrocketing. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:43:41
What are the buying limits on this. And the percentages. For example if I need $3200 in bit coin, how much would it cost?
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:19:17
Up voting for exposure.. This needs to go to the front page as I'm sure most redditors have somewhat of an idea of what bitcoins are.. As well as many buyers such as myself. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:25:22
As an economist. The pile is never too big. It's not about having a lot of money. It's about making more money. I could have a trillion dollars and my mission would be how to make the next one. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:35:41
I hope they can buy/sell ethereum. I like to diversify.
Edit: Seems their website is glitch. Keeps asking what state I live in after I've imputed it multiple times. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:45:02
I just made a post on Ethereum subreddit asking if there is another that I can buy BTC and Ethereum like Coinbase. But you know, not them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:35:08
God I hope so. Fuck coinbase. They have a damn monopoly on btc. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 08:39:26
Just use SnapCard or Circle. Coin base are assholes when it comes to customer service. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:08:06
"Is our children, mining?" 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:54:01
Fined 369M? Jeez. They laundered billions I'm guessing. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:36:08
I prefer my assets not being monitored to be honest with you. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:19:41
This would help for non interest bearing loans as Muslim law dictates. So if this catches on. It'll be huge. As an Arab myself I'm slowly teaching my family about it as well. I've been using bitcoins for a few years now myself and will continue to do so. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:15:39
So how do I download this. I'm on iOS. But jailbroken as well if that helps..
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:53:40
Any timeline on an iOS app?
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:47:14
Hopefully the next few updates can fix that. Or a jailbreak tweak. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:35:47
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:42:59
I see. I use my iPhone mostly to be honest. Thanks for the info
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:49:45
Point well taken. I think I'm just gonna say F it and do it tomorrow before bank closing time. What's the worse that can happen? 
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:32:54
Not unless it's resolved over seas as such. Not that I'm aware of atleast. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:47:29
I just wanna buy watches and stuff like that for resale. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:56:00
Thank you. I'll take a look
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:56:21
That fixed it.. Havent used it in a while so I didnt even notice it..Thanks for the help
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:00:40
Is it something bad I should worry about? Either way I signed up for Snapcard.io and Circle. I'm pretty much done with Coinbase at this point. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:36:44
I'll give them a look. Are they well reputable? 
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:36:23
I've heard they have been having issues as well. I'll give them a try. Thank you
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:27:12
Hopefully this isn't a dumb question. Does this go off of your own market prices or other markets as well?
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:27:56
Yeah unless you put them in a wallet like electrum and remember your passcode. They're gone in space
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:49:26
Thanks. I'll check it out 
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:56:09
I'll find a way to flash it on a USB and install it at every Apple store ��
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:50:05
Why would I be. I got a very high specs rig. Might as well use it as much as possible
