Dear user of reddit.com,
first we want to apologize the late answer.
We did not realize that a topic on reddit.com 
has been opened until the administrator of
bitcoinforum.com suggest it.
It is right, our domain has been registered on
the 23th march, like "distortednet" mentioned it.
But it has absolutly nothing to do with our foundation.
The webpage is accessable since february under a static IP
for choosen persons. In march we decided to public our webpage,
so everyone can visit it.
Our main reason why we waited such a long time to promote the
CT-80 is because we needed to ensure that we are able to ship on time.
Bitcoins are our only accepted payment method, because we want to
support this currency, after all the CT-80 is developed to mine
Bitcoins. We can not take refunds because we build by order and need
accurate calculations to prepare the shipment, which is soon.
All these details can be read before the order is made.
Like we have announced on  we will publish
in a few days pictures of the hardware as a proof.
One last thing to say is, if you find any mistakes please contact us
via the support form on our webpage, we will correct it as fast as possible.
Also we apologize that our webpage created this impression to you.
Your CedarTec Team.
