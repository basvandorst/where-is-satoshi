Depends on your income level. You’ll be taxed at whatever bracket you fall into should you be actively trading not just holding long term. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:39:13
Nah I think a big boom is upon us
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:54:09
Mining bitcoin now requires ASIC chips. Nothing else will make any impact at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:12:55
Be patient my friend. Korea ban news and China mining news delaying it. I think this will be the last weekend of a bull altcoin market before Bitcoin makes a run again. If I’m wrong, then I concede to say I don’t know what’s going on anymore. Of course, in such a dynamic market our opinions and beliefs adapt according to new developments.

Didn’t read your post but came here to say I hate that slow garbage pile of shit website they call an exchange
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:19:50
Well hopefully your time comes soon, but there’s plenty you missed. VEN, QTUM, NEO, XLM, MCO, ADT... list goes on and on. Even shitcoins like RDD ran up a ridiculous amount and are holding. 
But this is with a trading approach and not a hodl approach. From a hodl standpoint, I always stick with BTC, ETH, and LTC. 
Edit - Some coins listed are worth holding as well, not just trading. Not investment advice and alt coin trading is not the focus of this thread. Go BTC! Runup soon

Aside from this bounce, the daily chart shows a down trend for the past week... every candle has been red. we must interpret charts differently. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:48:15
So if one were to make a significant investment in multiple ASICs.. is there a way to tell how competitive it will be? What if the hardware becomes obsolete before it pays for itself?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:45:59
Look for a wallet.dat file

Could you touch on your stance once again? Are you saying that you’re anticipating a drop like the one from 1000 to 150? And that you bought at 150? Not sure if I understood that correctly. But i do see your points! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:18:55
There was well over 200K unconfirmed transactions at one point. This is the scaling issue you’ve probably heard about. It is because the block size is capped, and can only process a certain amount of transactions at a time. 
However, Bitcoin will be implementing the Lightning Network soon, which will alleviate the scaling issue by cheapening fees and make transactions happen much faster. 
Whereas Bitcoin Cash just increased the block size, which isn’t future proof. They only kicked the can down the road and will run into the same issue if it scales up. 
—Edit— basically, DYOR on Lightning Network and Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:30:23
They all are developing private blockchain ecosystems. They completely understand the underlying technology. They just don’t agree with bitcoin itself, as it is “backed by nothing and decentralized.” They are all for private Blockchains and USD Crypto, backed and regulated by governments and/or centralized banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:43:51
Curious.. if bitcoin mining difficulty keeps increasing, then how do we know how much mining will produce throughout a year? Can you factor in difficulty changes? Super curious. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:31:40
Hasn’t he been saying it’s not a bubble...
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:49
Miners are incentivized to do so by the potential to achieve the block reward of 12.5 BTC. If solo mining, which is extremely difficult, you’d get the entire 12.5 BTC. If mining in a mining pool like most do, you get your share of the block reward. The transaction fees are separate and added rewards to miners. So per block they may receive 15 BTC total or so when factoring all the transactions fees.

There’s too much infrastructure already surrounding bitcoin. It’s the base pair on every exchange as well. Some points to think about. It’s also the only one gaining credibility in traditional marketplaces. Been around the longest as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:42:53
Bitcoin looks weak to be honest. I wouldn’t be surprised if we have another few days of downside. Likely will hit 10-11.5K again. This is a dead cat bounce. Daily chart gives you more perspective on it clearly being in a downtrend that hasn’t reversed quite yet. But then again, who knows, its bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:10:59
Coinbase is super touchy with this stuff. They might close both accounts because the same bank is linked to two accounts, and they might cite their rule of not having multiple accounts. There’s a chance of this, so just a heads up. 
What I would do personally is keep the bank linked to his account only, purchase the bitcoin, then send it to your wallet. If you’re more intermediate, setup a GDAX account so you can send it for free. If you’re a beginner, you can just have your brother hold it for you and mark how much bitcoin is yours. Then he can send it over when fees go back to normal.

Kraken is the worst. I got hit with the withdraw limits hard. Verification took forever, ended up not even happening and I missed out on a lot of action because my bitcoin was stuck for way longer than it should have been. Needless to say I don’t use Kraken at all anymore. Gemini &amp; Bittrex are the kings.

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:49:16
Nobody actually knows, people just make their best guesses using a variety of fundamental and technical tools. Even so, you’ll hear different answers. At the end of the day nobody actually knows. Anything can happen with bitcoin. It can go a lot lower or it can rebound easily. No straight answer here. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:29
We shall see. Consider that the financial market veterans make the typical bitcoin whales/dinosaurs amateur small-timers. My speculation is that big bankers and investment firms are accumulating as much as they can right now. There’s so much incentive to do this, as they can then short with futures to then sell their load to bring BTC down, to only finalize the futures contracts and then buy back their bitcoin with their profits to get more BTC than they ever had before. Futures can add a lot of pressure to the downside. Bears can make a lot of money now. Of course, this is pure speculation and I am only making a case for the bearish incentives. BTC could always continue this bullish trend. Who knows? Just seems way overextended to me. But BTC never plays by the rules...
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:25:53
You mean the massive head and shoulders completing the right shoulder? Yeah I see that. Prob will see downside for a couple more days.

@_date: 2017-12-10 08:26:18
Red = Sellers/Sells
Green = Buyers/Buys
When there’s more red (sellers), it’ll drive the price down. When there’s more green (buyers), it’ll drive the price up. 
It’s a constant battle between buyers and sellers, and the price will move up or down depending on which side has more force. 
Added bonus tip since you seem new, someone who is betting on bitcoin rising in price is referred to as a “bull” or being “bullish.” Whereas someone who is betting on bitcoin falling in price is referred to as a “bear” or being “bearish.” 
You can be a bull or a bear and switch between them in response to what’s going on in the Crypto world or any news.

That’s incredible. Thank you for bringing this up. I’m going to look into extensively. I want to build my own! If you want to as well it’d be cool to figure it out together. Let me know your thoughts or if there’s any good resources where I can start. Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:12:19
Solid answer ! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:48:31
Well, if the first round would prove profitable - more funding to bring on more resources wouldn’t be an issue. My calculations show significant profit per month using a combo of L3s and S9s. 
I know that people refute mining because of difficulty increases and such, but it seems like the gear will pay for themselves and turn a profit well before upgrades are needed. 
Trying to hear everyone’s perspectives, very interesting. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:51:19
So what I’m getting is that had you bought miners, you would have profited more? Sorry, that was the longest sentence in the world, lol, not sure if I read it right!
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:24:06
That’s badass. I’m an open book. I like other people’s perspectives. Didn’t even know you could build your own ASIC. Incredible. Do you have any sources on it? I’ll look it up in the meantime. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:29:20
The market cap is now ~$250 Billion. 5 months is relative. In the crypto space, that’s a lot of time. Especially with the influx of hundreds of billions of dollars. You’re 100% right though. It’s quite a gamble to say bitcoin will continue growing at this rate. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:16:30
Yeah, I got you. That’s crazy! Good luck with future endeavors. You have a lot of experience under your belt now. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:11:30
Lol! Oh come on. There wouldn’t be miners if it wasn’t profitable. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:12:58
Interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:31:35
Very interested to see the new products coming. I guess it’s akin to building a pc. New cpu and gpus are coming out faster than ever. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:52:35
Yes.. go ahead and calculate it yourself on whattomine.com .. it factors in energy costs as well 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:12:01
Why would people mine at all if this were the case? Genuinely curious
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:06:12
Oh, I see what you mean now! Wow, I’m surprised you haven’t recovered the $10K yet? How many miners did you get and what type?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:07:04
those numbers are from ages ago.. smart to use a conservative number, maybe a little more liberal would be more realistic? Nonetheless, great point to make. I may take a run at it. Still considering everything, so your input helps out a lot. Thanks!

@_date: 2017-11-24 00:18:00
whattomine.com shows really good profitability.. less than 3 months ROI with the S9 and one of them can make you $400-600 a month at current rates. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:17:33
For using leverage, yeah I’d agree. Otherwise what are you saying?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:39:04
:( 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:52:25
Thanks for the advice. I’ll be more careful next time when it comes to chasing a loss. Gambling isn’t an issue I’ve ever had but it was here when I tried to time the long trades. I should have held my short. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:18:36
I’ll have to look into it. I never cashed out so something to speak with my CPA about. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:52:00
I agree that timing the long trades was a gamble. It was a bad mistake and I went against my trading plan of holding a short. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:43:02
Thanks, you’re absolutely right. I went against my own principles during this. Can’t believe I went long. THREE opportunities wasted. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:59:18
Solid advice. I just had to write all this out to get my thoughts out and vent. I’m going to go strategize and I will be back. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:39:09
There’s nothing wrong with calling it exactly what it is. It’s fiat currency. More specifically USD. There’s no issue with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:13:50
Thanks. I’ll be back soon. Wish me luck! And I’ll share with you before i take my break... my thoughts are that our best support is 7500 ever since we broke 10,800. God I wish I held my initial short. 
I have to let it go and take some time to get back to myself. But yeah, as long as 7500 holds we are golden and will head back toward 20k soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:44:35
It’s the worst feeling. I feel sick. I’ll recover. I have faith. I don’t know how. But I will hopefully do it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:26:24
Yeah I was for using leverage 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:56:16
TP and SL? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:34:05
Expand on your thoughts? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:12:35
You have fair points but you don’t know the context and my story. I traded from 1.3 to 15 BTC making money in bull and bear markets. It wasn’t by luck. It was from lots of research and watching news and charts daily. I never touched leverage once. I jumped into something new like a kid in a candy shop and fucked myself over. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:46:39
The long side of it yeah... fuck man I need to step away and restrategize how I’m going to do this 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:40:39
Expensive ass lesson. 15 BTC down the drain and my holdings should be upper 30 BTC had I held my short. I can’t believe I did this to myself. I’ll try to come back but it’s going to take some time to get Capital..
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:47:09
Thank your for typing this up. I appreciate it and will stick to trading strategies. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:49:07
If I get to the point where 15 BTC isn’t so bad anymore, I will be so grateful. I believe it’s possible. But I am essentially starting over and have to recover my initial investments. Wish me luck...
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:13:59
If I leveraged traded up to 15 BTC I’d agree. But I didn’t. I took calculated risks and traded up to 15 BTC in bull and bear markets without leverage. Leverage was my wrong move. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:43:36
Lmao 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:50:58
I know it was. It was such a bad decision to time the Long trades when my trading plan was to hold a short. I didn’t gamble my future away, I only set myself back. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:31:36
Ok bud
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:58:47
Yeah I’ve read it which is ironic. Difference is, I’m not giving up. I’ve learned too much to leave. Wish me luck lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:53:52
Yeah it’s a good opportunity to risk wisely with a long after consolidation. A month from now will look very different. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:36:29
This is the reality in any market. Those who stay believe in the value. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:04:08
Oh I should have put that together lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:45:58
You’re right. I went against a lot of my trading principles during this and could have handled it much better. As soon as I recovered I should have pulled out and walked away. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:25:41
Thanks for the perspective. I do think luck is involved, but it’s not all luck. I’ll give you additional context: I’ve been trading traditional markets since 2009. I got serious about crypto 8 months ago. I took some hits along the way to 14+ BTC, it wasn’t all a smooth road. 
There’s a lot I can speak to, but first let’s see if I can prove myself and get back to where I was. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:38:13
It wasn’t a gamble. I was confident we were heading to 8K before this even happened. 
My problem was going long after getting cocky.
