Until a transfer between an exchange and a wallet over lightning can happen without the end user having to run Ubuntu or use code, no, it's not here......

Screw them....just restore your backups !

Got it.  Thank you very much indeed Vidarino.  If ever you require assistance with anything that's in my skill set, I'd be happy to reciprocate.  
The ratio of c*nts to helpful people on here is very sad.  5 to 1 maybe.  It's maths, so I stand corrected if I'm wrong......

Ah, I was rather hoping for help, not criticism....oh well....

Brighton Peak say to email ID docs to them.  Seems insecure to me.  I emailed them about an alternative (password protected email or zip), or even suggested an https submission page on their website, but after a week it seems they can't even be bothered to respond.

You see ?  All this fictional sky fairy shit is even causing arguments in here. FFS.  There will never be peace as long as the gullible continue to fall for this control crap....
Take your religious debate out of here please and keep it behind closed doors.

Can't stop checking.  Totally obsessed.  Pouring over spreadsheets....

thank you kindly for the help.  I will have a go at that later.  Much appreciated

sorry - didn't know about the sending a letter thing....I did it a good while ago, and it was done with online submissions.

Expert....ya think ?  Any familiarity with traditional fiat performance is irrelevant.  The world has never seen anything like this, so there are no such thing as 'experts'.

It's easy to bag things/people - I just thought I'd share something positive....

In the early days when you had to manually deposit cash into a bank account at the bank, in person, the cashier asked me what Bitcoin was - I replied "It's what's going to put you lot out of business one day....".  The blank stare was priceless......

OK, understood - I agree, you can't use bitcoin in place of fiat.....yet.  And yes, I'm sure we are a few years away from it being so (if ever!).  It may even be a generation or 2 before that possibility becomes so because such a huge percentage of the population are not tech-savvy enough.  
Some countries may have banned it, but crypto is borderless.  I'm sure there are still plenty of those citizens still using it.  
If Bitcoin is not the one - which one then ?  Or has it not been invented yet ?

And he's an expert ?  He's a f*cking ignorant establishment retard who doesn't understand technology, can't see the future and that his days are numbered.  Silly c*nt.

I tell you what serves no socially useful function - economists !
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:56:44
Economists don't know shit.  "No socially useful function" he said.  Pah !  Except to put the Rothschilds banks out of business.....silly c*nt.

The establishment realise they can't ban it.  They banned alcohol - what happened.  They banned drugs - what happened ?  The best they can do is tell us it's bad and we shouldn't do it.  
How is Bitcoin not putting power in the hands of the people.  I'm not trying to be facetious - I'm genuinely interested in why you think that's the case...
