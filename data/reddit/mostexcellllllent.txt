Nope, just found it scrolling through the sub. Great work though, really succinct and easy to digest.
Your post is a breath of fresh air in all of this speculative muck. We're here to right a wrong, and make the world a better place. That's more exciting than any amount of money would ever be.

You want your btc to loose value ever year? 
Inflation comes from the fed printing more money. That’s what we’re trying to get away from. Not saying a totally fixed supply is a good thing, like btc, but it is interesting

smart contracts though no? Isn't that essentially what you are describing, but just hold it in escrow until the bill accumulates and all parties agree?
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:46:35
There's a limited supply (21,000,000 coins). With that capped, if demand increases, price increases to meet demand. Once demand is met (people no longer want it bc it's too expensive), the price levels off.

This is stupid- forks are the beauty of bitcoin. Different groups express what they want, make it happen, and the public decides which currency is given value. No one central authority can come in and take over- pretending they "know what's best for everyone." You know, because the federal reserve is just sooooooo good at that.
When a fork happens you now own 2 coins- it is of no detriment to you...

Oyyyy vey bubbi- 5% inflation every year for a joke coin, I just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:23:16
agreed- anyone actively interested in investing their time learning about crypto is making your holdings more valuable. 
If you own crypto as a speculative endeavor it is your job to make the "normies" feel comfortable in investing. Price only increases as demand increases. Don't insult the demand.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:41:45
hodl to the moon! 
But seriously- yes, if you are speculating that the price will increase hold them. The idea is that eventually you should not even need to convert to fiat. You can just use your coin to buy what you need. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:54:12
Welp- I suppose it would also take a lot of time/effort to chip a chunk off of your gold bar to pay for a coffee. So if you equate btc to gold, then things seem more reasonable.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:29:47
Because it's insightful and absolutely relevant to this post.

Fair point- we need amazon to start accepting BTC. That would be a game changer.

This for sure. It takes a lot of grit to stick with a dog of an investment. People who held on from the early days didn't necessarily get rich 'easily'. There was probably a good deal of pain and stress along the way. Nothing's easy.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:05:22
Idk with some solid tech upgrades and improved UX it could at least become a good store of value. It doesn't need to be a currency to be valuable. You can't really go to the deli and throw some gold on the table for a pack of gum.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:13:46
I beg to differ. Limited supply forever- it's a scarce resource with first movers advantage. I think it's here to stay. Just hodl.

Will the split involve uploading my ledger private key into a sketchy wallet (like the bcc split)? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:22:55
Fantastic write up. Thanks for this.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:15:10
Get a ledger- trezors have had security bugs that can expose private keys and I’m pretty sure ledger still allows you to hold more types of coins- it did when I got one.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:22:35
Those address with a ton of coin are likely exchange address’- so that’s coin that they owe people.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:23:19
10 - 4. And yeah I was under the assumption it would be best to move my coin off ledger bc my ledger key also holds everything else. No way I’m moving everything to a new key just to unlock this segwit token.

The Chinese government is heavily invested in bitcoin mining from my understanding. Its not going anywhere, they just want to have more control over the trading...

@_date: 2017-10-21 15:10:35
No- my crystal ball says people are piling in to get their fork coins. Once the splits happen they will reassume their alt positions and bail out of btc and we will be in for a small crash as the market redistributes. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:06:05
Idk regardless of his post history i think that there is something extremely valuable about zero fee transactions. When the memepool was backed up 200k tx my IOTA was flowing fast and free. Meanwhile is was getting hit with $40 tx fees for BTC. Real usability cant wait for BTC, and from my understanding lightning has not been going too well.   
I haven't been following lightning for a while though, so i may be missing something. Happy to hear any counters.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:18:35
Except it charges a fee of 0 to process transactions... and can do a lot more than visa, like transmit data from IOT sensors. And I believe once the network grows substantially enough (thru partnerships with major projects using iota hardware) then the coordinator can potentially be turned off bc a Monte Carlo walk would  be much more reliable from a larger dataset.
Iota may not be all the way there yet, but that’s where investing turns into educated gambling imo.
I think they can get this done.

@_date: 2017-07-23 17:34:19
Awesome- thought so just needed someone else to say it. In the event of the hard fork what happens to the coins? Do they double in my wallet?
Also, i'm a little scared in the event that for some reason my cpu up and dies on me. Are my coins safe as long as i have my wallet seed? Can i just re-download the wallet software on a new cpu, input my old seed, and get the $ back?
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:41:58
Thanks for the reply.
Is there a concern about wallets that don't do their own validation? I heard that could be an issue.
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:08:54
Pending just went through so i went ahead and sent the rest. When i did there was a pop up on Coinbase saying they were working thru a backlog. You're safe. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:43:55
Yes- this. 
Sorry I am a total noob but don't understand what happens to my BTC in my wallet.  Is it that i can choose to sell it as one of two currencies? One being much higher valued than the other?
Is there an action that i have to take once the fork happens, or can i just hold my coins for now in my wallet and wait for all the dust to settle, then proceed as normal?
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:33:47
Mainstream is definitley juming on the bandwagon- its not btc but the fed is annoucing support for XRP!

:D well put. Thanks for the insight. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:39:27
So I have a wallet and my own private keys, but do I need a wallet that also does it's own validation? Currently using Electrum.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:29:25
Just attempted to move a small amt off of coinbase- transaction is still pending but it showed up as unconfirmed in Electrum, will update when i have something.
