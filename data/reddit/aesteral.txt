It may be legal under the BVI Insolvency act and Insolvency rules. If 75% of creditors accross all assets class approve of the haircut (in which case it becomes resturcturing debt) it will go into force and will be obligatory even to dissenting creditors (those who want to sue) and their lawsuits will be denied by courts. See "Creditors arrangements" provisions of BVI law. 
If the BFX can achieve 75% of onboarding what they are doing is legal (outside of the possible exit scam fraud etc -- obviously criminal actions).

Deposit wallet is with Bitfinex. Bitfinex is BVI, therefore Deposit wallets are not FDIC insured since the FDIC does not have the jurisdiction over deposit wallets. I am surprised this has to be clarified.
Most users outside of US report that Finex uses banks outside of US  a lot (in Taiwan, for example).

This is no more secure than a self-signed certificate. You generate a keypair and publish it as keys of your website either via HTTPS or via Blockchain.
X.509 also ensures that the party who asked to sign the cerificate is actually the company behind it (Google is asking to sign a google.com cert).
In this case if you lose your Namecoin private key (lose access to your domain name) but keep your SSL keys safe a malicious party can just issue a new keypair and register it on the blockchain.

Sure, I know about the glorious free market which will make everything right once and for all but we are living in sad reality here where:
1. I just LOVE these airline promotions! I've seen a lot of places for a price far lower than the regular price for the route so I would not like these to go.
2. Yeah, sometimes resellers fail to sell tickets and get left with excess inventory. However, I can not buy these tickets through airline/train company booking system and have to go to some shady place like Craigslist to buy those which I usually don't.
3. Real world example - we here did not have personalized train tickets before and it was a quite common occurence for many years that you would ride in an almost empty train car on a 'completely booked' train. Last year we have introduced personalized ticketing and the same trains run completely full now.
4. Train companies here sell tickets for loss and are subsidized by the state to make the economy run better due to better population mobility. When there was no personalized ticketing system the only way for low-income people to get somewhere was to camp near the ticket office and waiting for tickets to become initially available. Did not help population mobility at all.

From what I can see right now there are two documents that display signs of being digitally signed, they are:
Ver Published - [Bitcoin.com_v7 \(final\) (Signed).pdf]( - has verifiable digital signature of Roger Ver made on Dec 15. PDF has a trusted timestamp embedded.
Ver Published "Bitcoin.com_v7 (final) (counter-signed).pdf" which is signed by someone who holds a public key published by Roger Ver who may be or may not be CZ.
All other documents are published without any signatures including documents published by OKCoin, that means that all your documents were either never digitally signed or were altered before publication.
Your "paper copy" has a printed signature and not one made by hand. The printed signature matches a 'signature image' present in all PDFs. That means that your 'paper copy' was printed out from a PDF and not signed with ink.
Edit: my opinion - v7 was signed by Ver and someone else, no proof no other contract was signed by Ver and okc later.

I am not sure that my local cinema even had tens or hundreds of millions of dollars at any point. Ticketing systems are amazingly easy, Passwallet and Passbook are already developed and available, gate operators use amazing high-tech devices called "low-cost android smartphones with cameras".
I suppose I could get a tech demo of a cinema ticketing system within a couple of days all with the QR codes and whatnot. But I am just an ideas guy.
Hell, even our local hipster movie cinema offers tickets bookable online and presentable on a phone. They use this incredible tech called "sending your ticket number by SMS".
Train companies and airlines ticketing systems cost more but faaar below 1 million USD mark.


Sure, airlines do, train companies not. 


Ok, here is the block chain, I can save 100 sha256 hashes in it, how does it help me to store inventory (free seats), run promotions, specify different fare rules for booking in advance, run gate information systems in airports where gate attendants see booked and non-booked seats, send SMS flight reminders to those holding tickets, etc? That's the value you get when subscribing with Amadeus or other providers. When you don't - you have the Block-Chain which stores hashes, nothing more. And you can store hashes in a PostgreSQL database accessible globally via TCP/IP. How does it lower the barriers?

In case of a movie theater the entire security system is a MySQL database with a read-only access for the gate operator and a write access for the ticketing system. When you operate a centralized system building security is easy.


QR-code is an unique string named 'code'. The secure system is:
SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE code = $qr_code;
Here, it is that simple. 
For train tickets it even easier since the train company uploads list of valid tickets with passenger names to conductor's terminals (they don't even have internet en route on those)! So the conductor scans your QR code and validate it against a pre-loaded list.
And after all:


No, they are just a "key". No cryptography involved.
The best thing about the ticketing is that it is by design not trustless and does not need advanced crypto.

If someone uses Android apps to store their bitcoins they are the only ones to blame. You are being your own bank, accept the goddamn responsibility for once in your life and don't opt-in for an 'easy' way of doing things!
Can you imagine if Wells Fargo stored all your money on some executive's Android phone? No, they use safes, distributed storage, alert systems and **so should you**.
Bitcoin is incredibly easy to keep safe once you stop trying to take it for granted - distribute your holdings over a couple of trezors, a ledger wallet (to keep you safe from future trezor/ledger exploits), laminated paper wallets and offline Armory. Use those wallets as co-sign keys for your multisig wallets and you are _completely_ _safe_.

Secondary markets for say airline tickets and train tickets are awful. Since you have put that much thought in your reply I'll give you an example:
A plane (train) has 100 seats. I buy 100 tickets in my name immediately they are available for 100 USD each and then open a Second market store where they are available for only 300 USD. Airlines and train companies do they best to combat the existence of the second market (including personalized tickets) for that very reason.
Same thing about concerts and plays. Second market is mostly speculators buying tickets to resell those for profit.

1. Every max block size adjustment requires a hard fork. 
2. Hard forks are extremely bad for the network. 
3. So, the block size problem has to be solved once. 
4. If we rise block size to 2MB - we'll have to hard fork over and over again. 
5. If we rise it to 1000MB (or remove the limit) a network can be ddosed by a malicious party having access to a lot of miners by making nodes run out of space and bandwidth today, not in some imaginary 30 years. 
Thus, both 4 and 5 are not solutions.

I have a Xapo card, it is a bank-issued Visa card with bank name written on it. Guess what? I even had to call the bank to get it activated. 
It debits my BTC account by selling me EUR for my BTC (for a sweet 3% fee!). Then Xapo gives that EUR to the issuing bank. The bank is West Crest in Gibraltar. If you have some issues with your Xapo card guess who you call? West Crest bank. 
And about Bitwage - yeah, the give you exactly that - bank account. With a bank. 
So your method is wiring EUR to a Bitwage bank account, buying BTC from them and then selling BTC to Xapo for EUR. 
The fact that Xapo sells you EUR on demand instead of pre-selling it does not change anything.

You are wrong. Let's analyze some scenarios. So, Gox fails and:
* I have BTC on Gox - I lose everything I have
* I have fiat on Gox - I lose everything I have
* I have BTC in my wallet - I lose 0 BTC or some fiat depending on how well I handle the price drop.
* I have fiat on some exchange - I lose absolutely nothing and gain some BTC due to the price drop.
* I have fiat in my wallet - I lose nothing and grin.
So, if Gox goes down and I have my funds elsewhere - I'm fine, if I have them on Gox - I'm screwed.

No-no, I've meant that if I'm going with MtGox's "priority withdraw" I must give them a 5% fee.
But if move my fiat to another exchange I lose the amount of spread (which was close to 5% when I did that) and trading fees. So I've a lost a bit more than 5%, mostly on trading fees. Now the spread is slightly wider so the loss would be greater too.

Fine. So how do I exactly retrieve my abstract 100 USD of investements currently in MtGox and spend them on some pizzas? And if I can't do it now when I will be able to?
Edit: and the ones who move their funds from Gox now do not take loss because they can move the same amount of BTC to Gox back and buy the same amount of Goxbucks any time they want.

Not exactly, the market says that they are willing to wait indefinitely for Mt.Gox to sort things out while understanding that they may never sort things out. And it's not a few weeks because their so called "hiatus" is now close to 15 weeks now.
You should always remember that Mt.Gox operates on trust. They can file for bankrupcy any day and put all their obligations on hold. Would you ever deposit your money to a Belarus bank which is notorious for not returning them? Why would you deposit it to Mt.Gox who does not even have a banking license? See, trust.
There is no finance business in the world that can withhold payments on its obligations for a quarter and still have the privilege of trust. And I don't think that Mt.Gox should have it.
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:46:40
Totally agree. I've asked them for a priority withdrawal but then cancelled it and moved my BTC out. I've waited for a market swing to make the spread more narrow and've lost just a bit more than 5%, mostly on trading fees.
@_date: 2013-09-19 08:55:15

Ok, lets do some math.
On Gox we have  (in BTC):
* USD - 8865
* EUR - 874
* JPY - 713
* CAD - 52
* GBP - 203
* CHF - 15
* AUD - 243
* PLN - 100
* Other - less then 10 BTC each
* Total - 11065
And on Bitstamp: 12480 BTC
So, the takeaway is - Bitstamp currently moves more BTC than Mt.Gox.

You can also try and request a "priority withdrawal" for a 5% fee via MtGox support. It is currently less than a mtgox trading fee + spread + bitstamp trading fee so it's worth a shot.
