Pfft. I won't get excited until 2020

Absolutely. I still can't believe they got away with as much as they did.

Well legally, I mean it borders on financial fraud in my opinion

Remember like a few years ago you had 5,6 major exchanges with differences of like 10%?

I still have a wallet I can't access from back when it was like 30$.
I don't fret about it though, I know myself and would have likely sold long before it hit a 1000 if I could have

Future earning potential. A lot of synergies with their current suit of products and most likely more companies who already use GitHub moving to a 100% Microsoft solution for their non open source in-house projects.
Also keep in mind nowadays most software is subscription based. And Enterprise cost of those subscriptions are significant.
The possibilities are endless, I dont thinjk you have to worry about them making it back.
It's more a question of well they implement integration and how fast.
Edit: want to add. I am by no means an insider and there is probably more. This is just what came to mind

I was overly paranoid at the time. Still am and save keys and passwords on physical paper. Sometimes on encrypted notepads and I scatter them.
More often than not I don't remember where I put things.
Only got Bitcoin to buy stuff back then and often made new wallets.
Edit: too much info, may have misremembered something. Such a long time ago

sourceforge did a whole lot of shit that Microsoft never would.
And I agree, lots of Microsoft bashing throughout all the subs today. Some are ammusing but I don't think much will change.
I think we may see some better integration in ms developer suit maybe like git kraken to give developers an incentive to move to Microsoft tools.
And if it's better it's still a win for all of us.
I actually am kinda upbeat about it. VS does some things really well.

F** that. I regret not remembering where I stored this f***g wallet.

I see your point, but I respectfully disagree. The exchange rate is what gives a currency it's value. This one is just currency to currency. 
And the most convenient exchange rate to compare bitcoin to get a reference for it's value at the moment are Fiat currencies.
This will change as it receives wider adoption.
it's very inconvenient right now to compare the value of btc to say gold. How much is an oz? can you tell me without looking it up and doing some calculations? (i.e. exchanging Bitcoin for dollars and multiplying by the dollar/oz gold exchange)
I bought bitcoin the first time many years ago, and many times, not as an investment. 
To buy things on Agora and similar markets (more groups, and no not drugs but data mostly) anonymously. And to buy things that others would only share anonymously.
BTC was less than a few dollars back then. I never anticipated it to be worth more than 3,4 maybe 5 Dollars.
But I saw the value in using bitcoin. Anonymity, no transfer costs (miners do the verification and get rewarded by this itself in btc), and safety (I know, mgox, agora... but all those shut and run scams will end with wider adoption I believe)
Remember the biggest problem, 5 or 6 years ago? 
Every damn exchange had a different exchange rate. Not 1% difference, 5-10%
If you can't readily exchange BTC, where would it's value be? How would you know what it's value was?
 
I think China's RMB and it's slowly loosening dollar Peg are a good example of the benefits to the valuation of the currency itself (not speaking of the economy of course) by letting the market value it in dollars.
Wherever you see btc going, 2008 is over. It's not going to replace FIAT in our lifetimes. So for it to hold any value and gain value is more people valuing it in other currencies. Higher adoption and ease to exchange will eventually lead us to one day, being able to tell you the BTC/OZ of Gold Exchange rate of the top of our heads.
my 2 cents. 
excuse the english and typos, no native, and dog pulling my trousers wanting to go out the whole time i'm typing up this

Probably a f-about question. But anyway... if there was only 0.000001 Bitcoin left in circulation yet it's still regularely used as a currency people would have to split it down further. Imagine 1 million people using it daily to buy things.
When there were millions of Bitcoin an apple was 1 BTC. 
Now there is fewer BTC but you still want that apple. 
From millions to 0.00001 you can take that ratio and the 1 BTC apple would then be 0.00000000001
But yeah. It's not like it will come to that point. However it's the basic reasoning why over the long term as long as you have adoption the value has to go up.
