I don't know who or how to report him though. I have nothing but a temp email and he does all the things a clever thieve does in covering his tracks (e.g. masking IPs). 
Also, I simply meant he was well mannered. But you're right, what he is doing is inexcusable and wrong.

No, they basically said it's for me to chase up with the buyer. I figure this may be one of two things: 1) he's the account owner trying to reverse the transaction and get free btc's or 2) it's not his account and he's just noticed £2k missing. 
The mentioned data protection policy as the reason as to why they couldn't reveal the details.

He indicated they won't be reversing anything at this point, but it does sound like a lot is down to the judgement of whoever picks up the case.

No, there's various online services where you can send an SMS and set the from number/name. He obviously knew what the message should contain and the number/name PingIt use to send messages.

It wasn't the branch, I got a call from the Barclays fraud team. The guy seemed like he couldn't really be bothered. Might be best if I ring back the fraud team and let them know other people have reported fraudulent transactions against this user. My concern is that I might have to drop the "bitcoin" word at some point. I know Barclays are particularly funny about sending money to btc exchanges.
