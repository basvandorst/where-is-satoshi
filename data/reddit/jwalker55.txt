Have they considered improving their software, processes, and execution so they don't have to manage so much bad PR?

The thing is, they run in Amazon AWS, so they have practically no excuse in regards to server scaling. Amazon even wrote a friggin article about them and how they're using AWS. One would have to assume that the software they wrote on top of AWS must suck balls.

It is working very intermittently. I got a purchase to go through, but took several tries. Coinbase is having service issues right now. 
GDAX is also having issues.
This is also a friendly reminder that it's always a good idea to transfer your money off the exchange and into your own wallet (hardware wallet, etc) for safe storage. If you hold all your money in an exchange, you're at risk of not being able to access your funds in times like this. With that said, Coinbase has been pretty reliable from my experience, overall.

The reason the panel in the OP is so expensive is because it's a low latency IPS panel with high refresh rate. Has very little to do with resolution. You can get other 1440p (or higher) IPS panels dirt cheap, but they'll be the 60hz variety.
