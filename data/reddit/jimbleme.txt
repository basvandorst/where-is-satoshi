September 29th, no responses or ticket updates received from CEX anymore. BTC balance still pending.

 * Sep 19, 18:01 CEX response: The transactions on your account can not be completed as our Risk department **has temporarily suspended** an option to make any deposits/withdrawals on your account until the AML/KYC procedure is completed.
Long story short, CEX froze the 3 BTC deposit without any notification. After days of exchanging useless emails, CEX reveals that the account has temporally been suspended pending completing KYC/AML procedure, which was completed 4 months ago.
There is no indication on my customer profile about any restriction on the account, which is validated with 10K per day fiat deposit/withdrawal limits and infinite crypto deposit/withdrawal limit. The 3 BTCs I transferred to my account on Sep17th,  are not just fronzen, but the full 3BTC balance has been spent (Blockchain link above)
All support emails from CEX, seem to be automatic based on templates, with no humans involved.

No change after 48 hours. No answer from CEX why the funds are not credited.

The saga ended today, and it ended well. I finally got the 3 BTC credited to my account and managed to withdraw them successfully from CEX.

 So I thought, after trading for several months. I heard about some delays for withdrawals, but one cannot necessarily point the finger at anyone for them. However this is different. With the blockchain explorer you can see the BTC movements.  So when you make a transfer in but cannot get credited and then you see the same address being spent. What can this mean except miss-using the funds of the customers?
