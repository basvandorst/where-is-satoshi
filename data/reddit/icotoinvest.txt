in the digital space, using the words "could be" has become as common as breathing. Nothing is ever entirely sure. It seems they run out of bs to feed the world.

I look forward to this day tbh. But i believe it will happen sooner than later.
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:58:36
Brenda can afford to do that. Nice shades btw :)

Saying you can forecast the price of bitcoin is like saying you know its gonna rain in 10mins without watching the weather channel.

It's unfortunate that $13mil was stolen, It's good news that the thieves didn't take anymore. But i think the main point here is, will this ever come to an end? This is peoples investments we are talking about. Alot of time and efforts has been put into all this, then someone else comes along and takes it all. If only there was some kind of insurance for situations like this.

In the UK, i've seen shops in malls that accept Crypto, but never seen Cafes or Restaurants. Mostly central London use crypto currencies as methods of payment.
@_date: 2018-07-09 07:05:06
If the price went as low as 3.9k, il make sure to buy then, without a doubt.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:07:14
How far will it go though? That's the big question.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:42:03
I think the Steering wheel gave it away right? :)  I'm a fan of Beemers having one myself, but a 325 convertible. And my dream car happens to be a Lambo. But if Lambos never existed, id definitely stick to M3's or M4's ! Thanks for being informative :)
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:43:49
Bank and Money are two different things, but i get your point.
@_date: 2018-07-09 09:00:06
It was only a matter of time since they accepted this form of payment. More and more cars will be paid with cryptocurrencies.  I'm sure they are talking about very expensive cars though, like the i8 or M series. Other manufacturers are accepting forms of crypto anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:24:49
That's in the UK, never imagine i'd ever see that lol
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:28:06
I hope so my dear friend!  Some of us have been in the game for a while now, others got in a bit late.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:17:39
Bitcoin over 8.2K, where's it going lads?  Any predictions?
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:42:19
I think your prediction is the correct prediction!
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:26:28
Wright as in Ian Wright? :D
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:05:22
I expected this guy to have more knowledge, but clearly he doesn't know crypto very well.
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:10:04
On a serious note, I always think about rich people buying a Lambo because Lambo's are extreme supercars, i believe there is more awe about a Lambo than there is about a Ferrari. Ferrari's has become to mainstream and people - especially the rich folk - want to be different.
@_date: 2018-07-12 06:15:30
haha fine, il do just that!
@_date: 2018-07-09 12:01:45
...and you spelt right wrong. So you're wrong too :)  
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:56:58
A guy driving an M3 that dreams of a Lambo... Not too far off tbh. Only 100K away.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:19:39
guys literally only want one thing and its no more posts like this maybe.
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:58:50
I've seen Lambo's being bought with BTC before. They are bought cheaper too. Look up YouTube video "the BTC lambo" you will see its true.  :)
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:22:25
pretty weird that Everything is down apart from BTC.. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:54:15
Indeed it could be a party if it carries on the way it is. I honestly believe it will hit close to 8K, that's what experience says. I guess we will have to see.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:08:00
I believe we are on a good path, we've crossed the junction.  /hoping
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:36:01
Well truth be said, i doubt very much a restaurant or cafe would accept any form of cryptocurrency. Sounds abit abnormal. :P
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:20:04
I believe we will see the 9000 mark one last time 
@_date: 2018-07-04 12:14:33
Just wanted to know your thoughts regarding this article. There is a point that was mentioned that, Bitcoin is the best type of currency around due to it being Decentralised. Do you agree?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:28:57
most predictions are wrong. its all theoretical anyway
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:14:19
The future is here. I'm surprised this is the only picture, i expected more ATM pictures from Hollywood.
@_date: 2018-07-09 09:01:11
Satoshis car for sure!
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:38:33
if crypto ATMs have fees also, they could be more than international fees. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:35:40
Something like that yea, what to do. Everything is theoretical, can't know for sure.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:28:37
Expansion and integration of Bitcoin happening around the world. So good to see.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:45:06
I like the last part of your comment, which is in fact true - Chinese regulations can do damage - it's also true and we must realise that most bitcoin investors are actually Asian so they have a big say in what the attitude of Bitcoin will be.
@_date: 2018-07-09 11:40:34
Even if someone said they lost it, would you really return 7K worth of Bitcoin to its user? ;)
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:39:54
I read another article that mentioned another amount stolen - $23.5mill worth. What is the real amount stolen then? This is confusing.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:20:13
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:07:33
Well that's true, but why would you do that, that's still downgrading :P
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:38:10
truer words have never been spoken \^.\^
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:32:47
Isn't this amazing, we are all BMW owners :) what a wonderful community this is.
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:22:51
Funny video, but that's pretty much how most Bitcoin holders feel like. It will come soon though - hoping.
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:13:15
Deserves some karma for that poem.
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:47:07
Ah nevermind friend :)  I got it in the end.
@_date: 2018-07-06 09:43:36
If he Hodl'd since 20k, he will Hodl until 20k again.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:27:55
Bitcoin won't die, and whoever said so has got his facts all mixed up. Bitcoin will reach ATH soon.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:03:32
Satoshi is no where to be found, no one knows who or what he is, and Bitcoin runs fine. Can't see why Vitalik will be a problem if he's out of the picture. Same with Steve Jobs or all other master minds behind massive projects.
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:40:27
Most of us want to see that happen. but WHEN??? I hate that the market is volatile and unpredictable.
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:35:42
When that day happens and Bitcoin goes 20K again, it will be the most exciting day for most Investors. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:11:57
This is true, but for many reasons, some of which are valid. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:32:40
It's unpredictable, you cannot take risks. That's why so many investors buy BTC and Hodl. People that had BTC from $500 are the fortunate ones imho.
