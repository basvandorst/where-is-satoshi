All or nothing? What kind of horrible investing advice is that? You are saying greed above all, no matter how much you can get if you cash out, you can always get more. That's a losing mentality

You can't look into a crystal ball. Nobody can predict the future. Bitcoin is very volatile which means it can go up a lot and it can go down a lot, that is the nature of investing / speculating: the higher the potential gains, the higher the risk. Everybody who is predicting the future, whether it will go up or down, is lying: there is no way to know. So I suggest to calm down, no longer invest in bitcoin and make peace with the fact that you could potentially lose everything you invested in it. That is why people suggest to only 'play' with money you can afford to lose.

You made the best decision you could with the information you had available. Nobody has a crystall ball, and btc is more or less gambling anyway.

You know how lang that takes? When in Europe the national currencies switched to euro, there were special calculators for people to make the transition, because everyone still thought about value in the old national currency! In Belgium for example, a bread costed 1.5 euro... And everybody was calculating: 1 euro = 40 francs, so that's 60 francs for a bread. Okay. And even today, in 2018, family sometimes talks about big amounts in francs! 
Now this is what happened with the switch from national currency to euro, which was supported by the government, they issued special calculators, posters, campaigns etc etc. This is never going to happen with a switch to bitcoin. If such a switch were to happen, it would take so many decades...

Belgians are more conservative/risk-averse, especially in fiscal matters. Funny that you mention the Dutch, because they got fucked by the tulips too.
