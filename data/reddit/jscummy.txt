Seriously, what the fuck does that even mean? They would have to have bought it somewhere to start.

Am I missing something, or do people actually consider this a benefit of bitcoin? For average people most other ways to move money are free, or at least they are in my experience.

Cash and check transactions are free, and credit card fees usually come on the seller side (I know that its passed on, but bitcoin users don't usually get a discount). Theres tons of p2p services for small transfers (Venmo, Chase Quickpay, etc). ACH transfers don't cost anything. The only time I can think of where bitcoin is definitely the cheapest is for international transfers.
I'm not trying to bash Bitcoin, I just don't think the current transaction fees are really a selling feature. In most situations you pay a small premium for decentralization and not relying on a bank.

Can I verify my identity by uploading an id for coinbase only though?

"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, and dangerous animals and you know it."
Even the stock market is super volatile right now because of flighty, irrational buying and selling. And the cast majority of people have a lot more trust in that than bitcoin.

This is good for bitcoin
