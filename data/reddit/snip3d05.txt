@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:38
depends on what happens with the CME
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:33:51
CME Futures
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:45:39
is it confirmed? havent seen any confirmation as yet.. i just know i had to swap where i mine last night because of idle time..
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:31
whales jumping out is good potentially, it will rebalance crypto overall, it could then be up for challenge against other cryptos or allow all of us to buy back in, at a much lower price.
short term drop (yeh a big one).. for long term gain.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:41:08
its still pending on my receiving end.. so it may be a while..
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:39:23
its all these sell orders. they'll clear. patience.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:19
mine took 45 mins, transaction finally showing as pending on receiving end.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:45:19
I'll give you $5.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:25
That's still ahead of eating your left ball imho..
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:20
I'm on my way to Andromeda, I've got escape velocity here..
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:42:20
so annoying was about to migrate last nights purchase...  look at the price drop already.. coinbase going down reflects on price almost immediately...
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:33:11
I should throw money at you to buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:38:09
you can refresh coinbase? wow you're ahead of me!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:03:32
more money to be made in futures by letting bitcoin keep climbing and then short it when everyone goes 'Ha, so much for shorting bitcoin' as its approaching 40/100/1000k
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:19:23
Crypto could die next month with regulation or a market crash etc. 
Keep the job until you have enough to retire on.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:08:09
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:10
damn.. was about to reach payout too..
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:12:35
doing the same thing.. for ages. i dont want this loop hole closed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:05:32
shutup before they fix it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:51:33
it is unlikely that that could happen, but china had a temporary ban which caused BTC to drop 50%. imagine the damage it would do if the US and/or Korea did it.
If you're swimming in cash, congrats, set yourself up for life. If you've got an 80k bonus and you believe in crypto, you could invest it. (i'd struggle to dump that kind of money in myself)
watch your portfolio grow, diversify, take some cash and put it in savings or property. spend moderately for majority of your life living off the interest.
Wish you all the best.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:24
the price is what it is when you hit buy. just takes a while to get to you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:09
"i hope so"
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:11:51

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:48:39
Zoom out for the year, look at the trend, spike, crash, level out.
We're just starting to level out. Just keep Hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:17:38
What happens if you both win?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:00:33
I'd still hold off buying just yet. we're still going down currently.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:34
11k could be possible in hours.. just touched 10,400..
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:15:03
Sold high ($7400).. now waiting for it to flatten out before i buy back in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:26
or coinbase being down...
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:59:47
Please everyone, sell so it crashes. then we can all buy back low :P
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:57:56
watch the graph and macd, pick a point you're happy with, generally go for a 5%+ and go from there... or thats what i do :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:52:47
Glad we're done messing around. Back to Bull!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:05:05

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:39
nah he said he'd eat it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:10:25
perfect. I'm in Sydney! :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:11:53
i was thinking that, but now its holding at 99** for so long.. i think it will bust throught to 12+ VERY quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:58:19
what kind of card is this bitcoin debit card? where can i get one?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:04
THERE WE GO!!!
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:05:35
please bitcoin im trying to sleep
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:50:12
Thanks for reminder, i missed out on the $5500. trend now looks like its going back down still anyway. Ill probably pick up a bit later today. Probably ~$5800-6k. Lower if I'm super lucky
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:58:21
I'm in the same boat. :(
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:19:52
So like 2024?
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:42:09
I have a 10Kw solar system for the home and although its free throughout the day. Should I mine at night, I lose money even at good electricity prices.
Should I not mine through the night, my ROI for the miner is more than triple due to the difficulty level going up.
