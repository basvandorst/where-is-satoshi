You're dilusional in believing that by convincing a fraction of Reddit Bitcoin users will somehow save the entire Bitcoin market from crashing.  You're being played for a fool with memes.  You're on a sinking cruise ship and you believe the ship can be saved by convencing the guests in your suite to drown with it.

Is he not correct?

You're right, investing in anything is a gamble.  The difference is the reasoning you equate to justify an investment.  Is playing the slot machine an investment?  Not typically, because you have no reasoning to expect those cards to line up based on anything other than luck.  Traditionally an investment in stock is based on companies performance, sales, business practice, shareholders, and market.  Gambling sure, but farther away from a slot machine because you hold reasoning to expect that investment to pay off.
But for BitCoin, what reasoning is there other than previous performance and the hope that it will exponentially increase forever?  BitCoin can be categorized in the high risk, high reward category of investing.  Put a lot of money in, in hopes of getting a lot out, but you could easily just lose it all.  There's no historical trend of BitCoin as a sound and secure investment, the market share is still extremely small and value is based tremendously on hopeful user expectations.  This in my opinion puts it more towards the side of gambling than investing.

Biggest correction by percentage?  Well no that's a half ass way of looking at it. Biggest drop in value? Yes, by wide margins.

You had 40k in an unregulated market?

If this is how you pay your bills and feed your kids, then you're in worse shape than I thought.

Bitcoin doesn't follow traditional currency trends, it has issues.  Transaction fees and wait times will rise to a point at which it will drop again and never recover.  Mining will also reach a point at which it is no longer profitable.  Bitcoin will rise and crash dramatically, causing people to loose thousands if not millions, and people on Reddit are spouting memes like it's a big game.  Those who hold, who already have significant returns, will lose.

That's what its been since day one.  This is a gambling subreddit, not investing.

As an outsider myself, you won't get rational insight here.  Bitcoin is nothing but high risk gambling fueld by internet culture and memes meant to pursuade people into believing that they're the wolf of the online Wall Street.  There's nothing wrong with that in moderation, but people here have invested entire life savings like it's a get rich quick scheme and they will inevitably lose it all.  Putting life savings into an unregulated, unstable currency with little value beyond it's holders is financially insane.

It's gambling, nothing more nothing less.  There's only so much Bitcoin can inflate until it settles or crashes.

What's wtf about it? You're in an unregulated and unstable market.

I see what you're saying, but the Bitcoin market is far larger than when it was before. It's like saying a penny stock correcting is equivalent to Facebook correcting as long as they corrected the same percentage.  Bitcoin dipping so strongly at this size is bad and my prediction is that it will get worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:36:02
This number will slowly rise and Bitcoin will crumble.
