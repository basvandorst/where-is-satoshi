Hey guess what...I hold both.

Yes. Unless something the price of the Bitcoin you bought when you bought it is the exact same when you recieve it (unlikely). So for example you bought 0.01 of Bitcoin when it was $9700. When it arrives you will have 0.01 Bitcoin but maybe for example it is $12000. So you would make whatever the fluctuation is between your waiting time.

Lower fees if you do bank transfers. But it takes up to 10 days to arrive in your account.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:47:21
No it isnt, because you can't get interest on top of interest that way.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:44:05
Yes to this as well.

Right now, both are taking super long so you might as well do the bank transfer. I usually go for the bank transfer for larger amounts and the debit for tiny ones.

It also helped me save some of my money and gave me the power of patience instead of blowing it like I usually did.

My dad just told me that it's cool and that I shouldn't day trade and just leave it in my balance and let it sit and accumulate. Also he said "make sure to study first and other priorities first before this." Lmao

Want me to circle the coinbase widget the next time? People seem to love that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:25
I got in exactly 31 days ago at $5779 this has been a crazy month. Been buying once a week.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:50:13
Same thing happened to me I even set it on the only remind once and it did this lmao.

8.7% here.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:42:12
I do! I'm 14 right now and started high school this year. Totally go for it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:14:07
Oh no roasted in the comments.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:54:18
Yeah looks like it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:43:11
I pay my pocket money as well as whenever I get any other money. Or when I get money from my (tiny) reselling business.

What exactly is dollar cost averaging? I only have a basic grasp on it. Currently I buy once a week and the amount fluctuates depending on how much fiat I have at disposal.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:44
I'm about to say it. Please don't expose me as a shill...the one in the picture I believe is a ledger nano s and the other popular one seems to be the trezor.

I would rather the flight doesn't go off course.

You got MINES in the mail! YIKES!

Thank you!!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:40:34
I have to thank you all for being such an inviting community. Without this reddit I wouldn't have been too interested in Bitcoin until I did a but of research. In the past month since I got into Bitcoin, I bought and learned to hodl and have already made profits and plan to keep on hodling, I expanded my knowledge on how these systems work and what value crypto has. I'm 14 right now and plan too keep hodling!!! (Currently have 0.05 btc)

It's an exchange, you can pull it up on your browser.
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:57:58
Wow that's wild bro, I had no idea we are in a descending wedge. Well fucking shit of course it will swing in a channel.

Its an exchange
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:44:11
You aren't making any sense right now. I just read number one on CMC and it says "Bitcoin" (BTC)  number 4 says "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH)
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:09:17
Oh sorry bro but that's incorrect.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:36:24
Close in market cap? Wtf you can't seriously be coamparing a 25 bil market cap coin to a 175 bil coin (roughly things change but as of now at least) 
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:28:56
I had 0.18 btc now I have 0 RIP

I got my friend into it when he asked me how do I make money like you do. Mind you we are just kids so making money isn't really the number one thing on our minds since we live life being supported by our parents. So since it has been established that we only put in what we can lose (that can be anything since we are kids) he says he wants to buy $200 of BTC. Since he is a minor he doesn't have a coinbase. I have one somehow it didn't ask for my SSN but regardless if I want to use GDAX I can use my father's empty account. So he brings me $200 in cash and I buy it in front of him (in front of ATM I put the cash in first) and I send it to his address while we are waiting in Starbucks since they got the wifi. I made him a BitMex account and have been teaching his some basic TA (I know "TA isn't worth shit") and so far this week he has gone from about 0.021 to 0.0235 which I'd some solid progress. When he wants to sell it I just buy it from him slightly below market price (I have to pay the coinbase fees) and either sell it myself or keep it.
