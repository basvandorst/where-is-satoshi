\^ delicious, properly cooked reformism
spitballing a bit now in parallel, with a distributed blockchain-based currency/financial system, the central fiat bank actually becomes far more effective, policy-wise, but interestingly because it lets them effectively set a global tax rate modifier (instead of increasing/decreasing debt leverage)
since the gov't has to be paid in its own fiat, issuing cash to buy crypto directly inflates crypto, reducing the real burden of fiat taxation, boosting the economy
using crypto to buy fiat deflates fiat, increasing the real burden of fiat taxation, damping the economy
this could be macroecon 101 stuff for the next generation

not a fud bot, just talking about fiat fiscal policy and pointing out how nobody in charge actually knows what the hell they are doing, which leaves private banks to fill out the middle and inevitably fuck everything up via leverage
on the other hand, currently crypto has a hardcoded deflation problem (arguable) and a single chain transaction volume problem (this one is clear), but there is plenty of spaces for the algorithms to improve and solutions to various problems are already scattered throughout the big coins and the shitcoins
IMO, crypto tech development is racing MMT to fix money, crypto from outside the sovereigns and MMT from within the sovereigns.

A terrible oversimplification of proper fiscal policy: GDP growth rate plus target inflation rate plus trade deficit as a % of GDP is the proper size for the gov't deficit (essentially, the printing rate because bonds are so liquid they still operate as money).
A bigger economy with higher prices and lots of imports is going to need more base money in circulation to keep things operating smoothly and keep private debts from overaccumulating and crashing the system. 
US growth is about 3%, target inflation is 2%, trade deficit is about  2.5%, so the US deficit should be about 7.5% of GDP. Currently we are at about $1T, which is only 5%; we are actually about $500B of spending short of target. 
Deficit hawks will crash the economy.

Greenspan has a better quote when Paul Ryan asked him about privatizing Social Security and he said, paraphrasing, "making the payments isn't the issue. The issue is how do we ensure the real resources (food, medicine, housing, etc) that those checks will ultimately buy are available in the future when retirees need them"~
@_date: 2018-10-29 01:06:04
Rate of inflation depends on nominal demand (how many dollars most people actually have to buy things with) and on productivity growth.
If the government printed a trillion dollars to dig holes and fill them back in again, that would be pretty inflationary, because the monetary base would grow in the pockets of workers without increasing real output.
But if the government printed a trillion dollars and developed a mass-producible Star Trek replicator, that would be extremely DEFLATIONARY, because the real output would ultimately expand by much ~~much~~ *more* than the monetary base. Imagine having debt from a pre-replicator society and now hav*ing* to pay for that with post-replicator dollars. You'd be fucked. Even though the replicator is obviously an enormously positive development overall.
When the predictable inflation of bitcoin is below real growth rate, it will act as more as an asset and not as much as a currency, effectively taking money out of supply, forcing deflation which increase the real value of debts. Deflation socializes the returns to productive investments in the economy.
@_date: 2018-10-29 04:23:07
We need a money supply that expands in lockstep with the real economy +2% (low stable inflation prevents keeps money moving).
Dogecoin has +5B units per year in perpetuity, for example, and that, IMO, is barely sufficient to naively operate in the real growth realm I just described in 90% of given years. Bitcoin inflation is far too low to act as money and not an asset.
Non-real monies as a store of value is a poorly considered concept in the long term for the group. All nominal savings in the past are fundamentally paid for with real output in the future. If the real economic output isn't there to fulfill that obligation, sorry, your store of value is not one, if its issuer is not "responsive". A monetary policy cannot effectively exist in a vacuum away from real resource constraints.

the irony is that fiat money production under a democratic regime arguably gives that power to the people
it just seems that capital tends to dominate the regime because the commons of the politic are too poorly defended to resist.

Selling Teslas for BTC would actually anchor the price of BTC in a really big way.
So here's what you do as Tesla. You buy a bunch of BTC. Like, 100k BTC. Over a long enough time that it doesn't rattle markets.
Then you announce that you are going to price the Model S at 1BTC.  The price of BTC will instantly go to like $100k. Massive capital gains on the BTC to offset the loss from reduced converted \*fiat\* prices on your cars.
Then you go to jail for securities fraud.

Deflation is a socialization of the returns of others' risky productive investments. Except this redistribution mostly goes to the wealthy who have most of the money in the first place.
Inflation is a transfer from *cash* savers to equity owners, most of whom, again, are wealthy. 
Two different sides of the coin. But one makes productive investment generate lower real returns than doing nothing and the other makes productive investment generate higher real returns than doing nothing.

Currently lightning network requires you to use a transaction to open a channel. In order to scale and avoid society getting trapped inside Banks 2.0., the L1 needs to have at least 1 transaction per person per month in order to periodically settle channels. Gonna need a hard fork to increase L1 enough to make L2 viable.
The idea of "malinvestment" is too hand wavey. It is a nebulous blob which portends to be "all those inputs which could have been used better", but you can't construct this class of things in practice. The concept is a ghost.
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:38:07
You can have deflation with both intensive and extensive growth.
The intensive growth self-limiting aspect you describe is interesting, but "sound money" falls to the extensive growth problem unless a mechanism exists to offset it.
The problem is that you have people who have productivity enhancing investments they can make, but because population pressure is increasing demand for money, say 5% extensive growth push deflation, you now have to exceed 5% real return in order to invest your money.
In this case, the money issues have limited intensive growth, which is the opposite of your ideal case. Financial incentives are shackling at times, aren't they?
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:41:55
You assert without evidence that velocity will increase to account for extensive growth. I find that claim extremely dubious.
Bitcoin has a hard limit on velocity anyway (same for all crypto, really).

I think we're talking past each other.
I'm not saying that the ideal level of cash balances is zero. I'm saying that *increasing* net cash balances at the price of anything greater than paper and ink is pure waste. Nothing to do with omniscience or opportunity costs.

There is an obvious example at the extreme that doesn't depend on subjective utility at all. If everyone held 100% of their market income at the end of period T back as cash in hand, output in T+1, and thus income, would be zero. If in T+2 everyone went back to working and spending fully, then the group is worse off than if they had just decided to print an amount of money equal to what was saved and put it under their mattresses instead of foregoing all the consumption in T+1. 
If instead of holding cash, saved money is used to pay down bank debt or is deposited into a bank that can lend, then the bank needs profitable lending opportunities to offset the reduction in spending or total output will fall. If the debt was held individually and not by a bank, then all of the money must be spent on or ultimately invested in real output in order to not reduce total output.

Their constraints are all fucked up.
Garrison thinks he is clever. His chuckling is like getting punched in the throat by smug.
An agonizing waste of 27 minutes at 1.5x speed.  When he "blows up" the demand constraint on the PPF around 40m, some people in the room laughed, and he calls it a "gateway to growth", I lost at least 1% of my brain cells.
I thought we were friends. ***BETRAYAL***

only via Segwit, legacy remains 1M
strictly speaking, 100MB blocks are already viable on a subset of nodes, using the equivalent of potatoes to what we'll have by the time we actually need 100MB worth of mostly L2 channel transactions on L1 in one block.
Eventually it is not possible to run a full node on that future's performance relative of a TI-83 and bandwidth relative of telegraph. That's not a major problem. The tech curve is far ahead of the protocol update curve, I assure you. Decentralization is not at risk, imo.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:05:23
Bitcoin as designed only has enough transaction capacity to do 1 settlement per person every 22 years.
Even assuming velocity magically increases 1:1, if each person has equal "cash" savings desire as before, the total share of the money supply held out of active circulation will increase. So really, you need the velocity of money to increase faster than 1:1 if you want to avoid deflation in a purely extensive growth economy, which is even more dubious. Velocity is used as a fudge factor. The whole concept is basically hand waving bullshit.
Even if population expansion is ultimately the result intensive growth, the tech that allows it was developed long ago (chemical fertilizers and vaccines) and the impact occurs over time long after the productivity growth has occurred and manifested in production rates. It is economically pathological to not invest in any productivity enhancing changes under 3% real return just because population is growing at 3% because food is cheaper now.
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:55:01
The idea of financial savings is perfectly sensible from the perspective of an individual. You get money and save it so you can consume later instead. 
But from the perspective of the society as a whole, uninvested savings represent an undershoot in productive capacity utilization in the current period with no corresponding increase in productive capacity in future periods.

L1 layer can currently only handle one channel open/close per person per  22 years at full global scale. That's super obviously not going to work if we really want to remain trustless and not just become banking 1.1
Max block size should increase in steps as needed. Miners want revenue, not high fees. If at some point doubling the block size cuts fees by 40% but the number of transactions doubles, then miners will be in favor of increasing block size, and it will inevitably happen. 
We just aren't there yet.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:22:20
I don't think a switch to 2MB blocks in a few years is going to cause much of a centralization pressure. The commodity prices of computer hardware and storage as well as bandwidth are diminishing faster than the Bitcoin network is growing. By the time we actually need 100MB blocks, we'll have had consumer CPUs with that much L2 cache for years. Storage will be less than a penny a GB. I am 100% not worried about centralization due to hardware.

If there is 5% deflation and I have a 4% real return project, I am not going to do that project. I will just hoard my money.
That is pathological and reduces real growth. In inflationary economies I will still do that project and raise total output, regardless of the inflation rate.

Why the hell would you loan someone a deflationary currency when you could hold it instead?
Unfortunately, lending is a critical behavior of productive economies. The agents with the money (representing control over real resources) don't necessarily have the most productive ideas and if they don't invest it in the ideas that are, then we are wasting real resources relative to the best possible future. 
The problem with deflation is fundamental:
Rewarding mere holders of a numeraire with more real resources over time is a pathological incentive that ultimately reduces real investment. Why acquire productive capital at all when you are better off hoarding? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:40:16
All that matters in an economy is how much real stuff it can produce. 
The unit currency which tracks the relative pricing between things, [known as a numéraire]( has no value of itself. 
Currency deflation is a self-limiting phenomenon because the more you have, the higher real interest rates are and the less productive investment you get to actually cause deflation.

Net population gain in the US is about 4000 per day from births vs deaths, plus about 2500 per day from net immigration.
They are only printing an extra $86000 per additional person. With a reserve rate of just 3%, that is about $2.5M of bank money per person. Which is about what you need to fully financialize each person's lifetime output.
