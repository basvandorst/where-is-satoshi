He has said many times it's paid with a VAT consumption tax, not income tax.  Pretty much every libertarian agrees we should move towards consumption taxes and away from income taxes.  That is what he is proposing.

Well this guy is not a politician, that's why his campaign is fundamentally different.  I'm not saying he's perfect, but look at his policies this is the best we have.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:52:43
Okay sure - no one is addressing existing income taxes, I hear ya.  I suppose I meant he is proposing adding a VAT tax as opposed to adding more income tax.
There's nothing libertarian about anyone running for president for 2020, so this is the closest there is to it.

I'm just addressing what xbox said

I'm not saying it's justified.  But it is a significant difference.  Facebook allowed users to be irresponsible with their data and users were irresponsible with their data.
That's very different than Facebook straight up selling data.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:28:57
Yes!  That is exactly what I am saying

alright take it easy buddy we're on the internet

With the Cambridge Analytica thing users opted in to giving their data to CA.

I'm not sure what your concerns are
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:02:50
I don't understand.  The government would pay for it (with their stolen tax money), not him.

So here is his written policy on crypto: 
Here's the important part:


















@_date: 2019-07-25 17:36:00
yeah, government steals your money.  Then it's the government's money.  now we're just talking semantics
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:41:03
this is completely short sighted!  What matters is how many people are employed and how large the bureaucracy is!
There are currently 52 million people on welfare.  If 80% opt in to the Freedom Dividend then you can pretty much cut down the bureaucracy by 80% as well!!!!
Change the numbers however you want but there's no denying UBI would drive down government bureaucracy.  52 million is not the same as 10.4 million.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:01:06
Interestingly Yang often talks about how UBI would drive down government bureaucracy because there's no means testing - the government is terrible at many things but it is excellent at sending large numbers of checks to large numbers of people promptly and reliably. - 
The approach I get from him is that he's a capitalist who understands there's a good amount of problems the market and private sector will not solve (such as shifting towards independent contractors as to not offer healthcare)

Do you even know what small talk is?

So appropriate bitcoin rips past 9K and 10K on internationalclimatechangeday.com!  What a way to celebrate the earth

Can someone explain to me `why` genesis mining is a scam?

Simply 'withdraw' in Coinbase and deposit it into the address of your gemini account
