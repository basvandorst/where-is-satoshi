Wouldn't he have regret at not selling if it drops back down to $6200? 50% chance either way.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:15:50
How is it *inevitable*?
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:24:08
By "steady" you mean steady for the last 12 hours? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:18:30
5000 would be great for me because it would allow me to buy back in and meet my goal, and then just hold and not have to worry about these price swings any more. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:53:58
No, never heard of that. I'll look it up. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:39:55
Yeah I was sweating for a bit there. I almost always sell low and buy high. This might cover 10% of my earlier losses from this year. We'll see since I havent bought back in yet!
@_date: 2018-09-01 21:06:02
Yep, if this works out going to move all to cold storage and not try to day trade again. Too nerve-wracking. Going to give it 3 days to drop but if it goes up to 8.2 before then I'll likely buy back in and accept my loss. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:06:03
If it's going to drop to 5.8, why wouldn't I just set my buy order there?
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:22:43

We went to 8k last month and then down to almost 6k, so anything is possible. I distinctly remember, because I bought at 8k. If it goes up to $8700 before dropping to 6.2 I'll cut my losses and buy back in and call it a learning lesson. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:09:39
Lol. Most of us here have bought at 10k, 15k,even 19k.  You have nothing to complain about. Did you even purchase more than 1 bitcoin? You will likely be fine. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:06:15
I would love to sell right now at $7025 and buy back in at $6200 and make a quick $800. I know if I try though it will probably go up and I'll end up buying back in at 10k. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:27:53
Done at $7029. Wish me luck. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:12:03
My call is $3850 by the same date. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:08:31
We will see in about 9 days. BTW I am basing this off of nothing but a hunch and what I have been doing the last six months to make money off this market. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:10:15
If it goes to 5000 next week I will immediately FOMO in at a significant loss. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:10:42
I don't have inside knowledge. This is a complete guess based on what it has been doing the last 8 months. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 19:54:24
Mark my words: Sell now (3/27/19) at $4007 and then buy back in at $3700 within the next week if you want to make an easy few hundred bucks. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:42:53
That would be even more impressive than what it did in 2017.
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:54:04
Trying to 'expect" something to happen in bitcoin based on past behavior is a fool's strategy. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:31:33
I stopped making calls awhile back because I realized how pointless it was. None of the calls in these threads ever amount to anything if made on past behavior of bitcoin. You would do better to flip a coin. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:22:57
I predict the exact opposite of everything you just said.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:56:34
The same Goldman Sachs that paid a 5 billion dollar settlement because they lacked the foresight to understand the subprime crisis? You're putting faith in their foresight? Lol.

People believe it is valuable because it is, for all of the reasons the person you replied to mentioned.
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:32:08
I thought so too, and then I read the sentencing guidelines and the judge issued exactly what was required under the minimum requirements. The main reason it is so large is because of the Kingpin Statute. Despite Ulbricht being young and initially having good intentions, he absolutely was running a Continuing Criminal Enterprise and was a "super kingpin." Many people argue that he never actually killed anyone and wasn't charged with that, so it should not have been used for his sentencing. But under the statute, it was absolutely appropriate to factor in his intent with his sentence. He definitely intended to have people murdered to protect his empire. 
It would make more sense to say that the CCE Statute needs to be revised.

When is the last time a petition has done anything beyond getting a TV show renewed for a year? What is the point of this?
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:23:46
Let's hope it doesn't repeat the previous trend in a couple months and drop to 4k, and then people tell you "What a great time to buy." (especially since I also just bought at $5600).
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:01:21
Please explain to me how is it going to be a standard as a currency if you are holding it and not spending it? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:15:34
People said that about 8k a couple months ago. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:43:57


I can tell you with 100% certainty that it won't. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:57:44
All you have to do is skip the Daily Discussion threads. That is where 90% of price discussion is, and 90% of Daily Discussion is price discussion. So just skip that one thread for six months and you're fine. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:14:15
Did you not notice the 40% drop in three weeks?
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:57:23
Would you care to revise your prediction?
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:56:21
11k DENIED

"Your trustee?" It's pretty clear you have no idea how bankruptcy court works so maybe look into it before replying?
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:54:52
It is pretty well known within the Bitcoin community that this is MArk's reddit account. It's been verified in the past. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:02:23


Literally no one is saying that. I see lots of speculation but I don't ever recall seeing anyone saying it will *definitely* go up a certain amount. 
Nevermind, I see you're a "redditor for 3 days" troll.
