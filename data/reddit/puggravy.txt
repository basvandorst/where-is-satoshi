Cryptocurrencies are fungible so diversifying doesn't make much sense from an investment perspective (Ethereum might be an exception but in practice it's not noticeable).
HOWEVER! From the viewpoint of supporting crypto currency investing in altcoins is definitely important! Too much Homogeneity in the market means a single point of failure for the whole market.

on top of that check out the [litecoin repo]( and tell me what you notice.

74 commits ahead of bitcoin core.
not even triple digits. 
What has he done in the space? I'm seriously curious. I only ever see his name when these stupid BTC BCH pissing matches come up or when he is being accused of something.

This alt-coin bashing is idiotic. A heterogeneous crptyo-market is a healthy crypto-market, why are you imbeciles begging to have a single point of failure?! If this is all about your nest egg, either diversify or suck it up and deal.

Charlie Lee used his status at coinbase to get his copy-paste crypto litecoin listed on the exchange, as soon as it hit it's all time peak he immediately sold all his coins because of 'conflicts of interest' (LMAO).

I believe every company you named there is a private institution. While I'm not unaware that one can have a bias even without a direct link to a government, RT is *directly* funded by the Russian government.
It is the height of Irony that any bitcoin enthusiasts would defend one of the most egregious examples of state attempting to control information.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:03:34
And the number of those Charlie Lee himself committed are even more pitiful than that!

None on the scale of Coinbase, none who have as much to lose as Coinbase with a bad implementation.

Don't even want to read that tweet, who cares what that con-artist thinks?

Heard there was a dip and picked up some BCH just for shits and giggles. I usually miss my oppurtunity to buy the dip because I try to avoid looking at the prices, but luckily some panicky coworkers alerted me. :)

Staying relatively stable with a decent long term growth is what would be best however.

I think congress threatening to defund NPR, ostensibly as a punishment for their views, couldn't be a better example of why state controlled media is a bad thing. So I agree with you there.

Unpopular opinion, but they are both actual solutions. Albeit with different trade offs. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:02
You only believe in the long term success of bitcoins as a speculation tool. The idea that cryptocurrencies can exist as crazy investments and as a useful medium for exchanging goods and services is absurd, lol.

TL;DR it's only down about 7% on the **year** and 'historic' is actually 'since **2007**'.

Only comment in this thread with an ounce of information. Thanks for being a beacon of hope in this sea of arm-chair economists.

My phrasing may have been awkward. The price of bitcoin and the cost of producing bitcoin converge on each other.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:50:41
Bitcoin has also historically had prices converge at or under the cost of producing bitcoin. Which is a much more deterministic metric than 'bitcoin has always had bull markets'.

You guys are acting like investment bankers aren't super pumped about having an unregulated market where pump and dumps aren't illegal and you can manipulate the entire market with barely any overhead
edit: I didn't even get into insider trading, which um yeah that shit is rampant as hell.
