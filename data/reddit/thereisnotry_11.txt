Yeah that’s what I️ was thinking..Bruce Fenton came off as a total tool in a Net Neutrality argument with Richard Heart on YouTube. 
Edit: He’s against Net Neutrality. He even praised Ajit Pai during that video.

"...HODL, HODL against the dipping of the bitcoin!
Those wise men at their end know BTC is right..
...They do not go gentle into that good night."

HODL. It will be over $17k in no time.

True, but it's also ignorant to assume to know when it will go down.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:20:43
Oh man hahaha that made my night!

You forgot the golden rule: HODL.

Oh god please don't let that hideous clownstick von toadface in this sub too...

LMAO!! I swear this is stuck in my head on a loop!!

Wait, doesn't this just show that 10k BTC are waiting to be purchased at about $2800/BTC?...and that theres about 4,000 BTC waiting to be sold at $10,000/BTC?
How do you figure this means it will skyrocket? I feel like Im missing something here.

Am I️ missing something? I️ thought Coinbase allowed you to lock in the price at the time of your order. I️ bought at 5800, so then when my payment clears and my btc shows up on my account it’ll be for the 5800 price am I️ right?

nope.
