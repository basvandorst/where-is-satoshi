Keep waiting for doomsday then, make sure to get in your bunker at the first sign of turmoil as well.

This is an ignorant presumption for 2 reasons. 
1. It's certainly arguable that the drop from ATH is 'blood in the streets.'
2. Most times a rally slowly builds up from a period of relatively low volatility, which is generally what BTC has been doing.
That being said I could def see BTC dropping lower, and I doubt a strong rally will come in the next few months, but it's still a good buying opportunity as the bottom is close enough.

A thing a lot of people are misinterpreting with this is that high volume does not equate to high profits for square or Jack. 
Seen a lot of people saying that Jack is a Bitcoin bull because of his own buisiness. This actually preferable since then the interest is not all in the money of it, but rather in the product.

Nothing I said is in agreement. I could see Bitcoin *potentially* falling to a low of 4k. Even in that case, most of the blood has already bled out. Leading to my main point:
There doesn't have to be a big sell off to immediately trigger a bull run as you implied. In fact, such a thing is a true anomaly.
Market cycles are real. We ate shit from January to now. Saying "waiting for blood" at this points pretty comical cause we are basically there.

Exactly who you said, Bitcoin cash supporters. Regardless, when anyone mentions it they certainly are not referring to some random microcap shitfork.

Using clean forms of energy doesn't make it free. Also, if mining was actually free, the value would likely plummet. Boneheaded article.

If you'd like to make things more appealing to the 'normies', using a bunch of cartoons only the most involved in the space will know or care about is not the way.

BTC is commonly refered to as Bitcoin Core since the fork, that coin you linked is just some nonsense scam that should be disregarded.

Super misleading title. 
First off, youre cherry picking a datapoint of somewhere around $0.15, when its obvious it fluxuates. 0.15 x 5 = 0.60(edit it's actually 0.75, duh lmao) the chart does not even show a $0.75 fee, so not even with the cherry picked data is 5x correct. 
Secondly, this is all pointless information to anyone who cares. Wow, a whole SIXTY CENTS to quickly transfer hundreds (Thousands) of dollars in value. Who even cares. The volume on network is doing well, and if you remember, December17 was hellish in terms of tx fees. Comparatively we are doing great. Not even mentioning Lightning network.
Bad clickbait nonsense journalism.

You got me there!
@_date: 2019-02-23 23:01:11
I would say it's a negligible argument, nobody in a practical sense cares about the tx fee in sats. The article makes it seem as though fees are skyrocketing.  Again, compared to the december17 highs, wouldn't you agree we are moving in the right direction?

You're missing the verb in your title.

Just like it stops at the end of the other 3 cycles, but it's not charted beyond the 4th cycle. 
And the rate obviously decreases on a log scale. Do you really expect parabolic growth forever? Get real.

Kind of scary that 12 hours later theres still no response to this other than the github.

If you think they are going to exclusively tax BTC at something outrageous like 80% you have no conception of how finance works.

Stop shilling your twitter with rehashed quotes

That's a mostly true statement but doesn't dismiss the benefits gained from responsible use. Playing the credit score game can save you many thousands on mortgages and other loans, and the ability to borrow can provide powerful leverage in business. Cashback and points programs can give you hundreds in value over the year if you just use their plastic instead of the paper you are spending anyway. Its a no-brainer.  If you dismiss credit cards merely because of the incompetent, perhaps you're in the group of incompetent.

First off 60% isn't 80%, secondly it seems like it's not even 60% in France, but 30-40% (still high).
If you're coming back to old comments to 'gotcha' me, you probably should be more on point.

You're unreasonably scared of debt. Many great businesses can only take off with the privilege of lent money. Basing financial knowledge on the lowest rung of society and not those who are successful is foolish. Debt is completely fine in responsible hands.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:14:34
Thanks for the info. Definitely intriguing stuff. I would say the guy on Twitter is too stuck on bearish ideas, though if he's correct kudos to him.

Credit cards are only as stupid as the people using them. If you have the responsibility to pay them off every month its a purely beneficial product.
