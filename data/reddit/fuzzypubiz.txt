r/Bitcoin is not the place to have a conversation about basic economics.   The majority of people in these threads think getting off the gold standard was a horrible mistake.

Try and think of it like the United States as a whole being a publicly traded company.  We have a shit ton of value and potential future growth, and people and countries verify it by investing in us.  That type of growth isn't possible without being able to "print" money.

It's useless to look at by itself and make broad assumptions.   Amazon operated on a loss for 6 years before turning a profit.  
If you were unemployed and lived in a million dollar house that's paid off, you wouldn't be losing your shit over having $50,000 credit card that's maxed out.

- The United States government has a net worth of $125 trillion dollars.
- 580 billion (65%) of US bills are used outside the country.  
- 40% of the world's debt is issued in USD
- More than 1/3 of the world's GDP comes from countries that peg their currency to the dollar.  
I get that Bitcoin is fun to gamble on and people like it, but to not acknowledge the strength and reach of the dollar is fanboy shit and you deserve to lose your money when it tanks.

"Tell me what's going to cause people to decide they want to move out of bitcoin back into dollars again?"
When you need to make a purchase in the real world.

Even if we did, the whole world economy would also tank including bitcoin.
