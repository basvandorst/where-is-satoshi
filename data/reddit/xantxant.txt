Authy is only vulnerable to this attack if you have multi-device enabled. Their official recommendation is to enable it, add another device, and disable it. I've done this several times to add devices. You can get codes texted to you if you have multi-device on, otherwise you cannot. (I've also tested that you cannot get codes texted to you unless you've turned it on.)

"Multi device" is putting your account into a mode where you can add other decvices.
If you turn it off, every device you've enabled is still enabled, you just can't add any more.
If your device is lost, you're not locked out, just use another device that you've previously enabled.

Masturbatory wish-fulfillment shitposting.
- This is cherry-picking. As many have already pointed out, 2019 isn't going to fit your optimistic growth curve (and you knew that, since you posted this on Dec 31). And if you looked at "monthly" or "weekly" or "daily" lows you'd get.. whoa.. a chart of the fluctuations of the market, you know, that chart you need to see when you actually sell it.
- "Won't sell at any price"? Huh. Then why'd you buy it? It's not a car you can drive or a house you can live in. It's a currency. If you don't plan to eventually exchange it for something, I don't think I need to be taking economics advice from you.

Well, more to the point ALL systems are limited by legacy code and secondary systems in some way. It's just a question of how high the load has to get before you hit THAT particular niche bottleneck.
You make all your systems as scalable as possible, but they'll all be limited by something, it's just something you haven't seen yet.
