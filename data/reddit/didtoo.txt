I did not get a reply on the possible PIN retry weakness.
[PIN delay increase may be at risk](
Is it feasible? If so, will it be fixed in the coming version (should be a small change)?

So fee was calculated correctly? So this was bad luck? No miner hit the jackpot for over an hour I understand.
I can see on  the times between the blocks, good to know next time.

Just now it jumped to 2 confirmations. Still very strange it should take so long.

The coming core release will have a more dynamic fee system, which replaces the current rigid miners fee. It will give the transaction parties more choice about confirmation speed and will take into account the transaction size (which will reflect miners chances/block size risk more).
See: [floating fee](
When the time comes, the fee height can be adjusted to keep mining profitable when the reward is not sufficient anymore.

The words itself in BIP39 are not used for hashing at all. Every word (in any of the available language sets (currently English, Japanese, Spanish)) represents an 11-bit number (0-2047). So upper or lowercase has no effect at all, as long as the word is recognized (first 4 letters is enough/unique) it can be translated to the number that represents the word (how you can enter/select the words is dependent on the wallet/seed recovery software). The word list is solely created for human readability. You can have the same seed in any of the language sets as long as the underlying numbers are the same.

I am using mytrezor.com, it is automatically added to the transaction and cannot be set by the user. I understand it should be calculated instead of fixed? I will take it up with the developers.

'your house' is not 'different locations'
When stored in redundant parts it is also safe from theft (without the burglar getting your entire seed, stealing your coins), which this is not. So the 'safest place to store your cryptocurrency seed' as mentioned on the website is just plain wrong. Or do you need to place it in a high-end anchored burglar proof safe?? Which is even more expensive than a fire-proof safe!!

Has nothing to do with multisig, this is not handy for everyday use of a hardware wallet. Redundant means you can loose one or more (depending on the used method) of your pieces of information while you can still recover the complete seed. And you need multiple parts to construct the complete seed, so a simple theft does not expose your seed (where ColdTi does).

Just use a hardware wallet (like TREZOR) and never store your seed/key digitally outside the wallet, only manually written down on paper and stored in a safe for backup.
