No, moving to a segwit address from a normal one still pays the normal fee. I would suggest waiting until the next time you want to make a transaction, and moving everything to a segwit address then.

Wait a few days, if you're lucky it could confirm. What fee did you set it at?

If a transaction sits long enough, it gets dropped from the queue.

It can act as a bandaid on the transaction volume problem until LN is implemented.

They don't want to. There reason is that smaller blocks make it easier for anyone to process the whole block chain (since you only need to handle 1mb every 10 minutes) and that making blocks larger would lead to increased centralization.
I personally disagree with that line of thinking, feeling that making sure transactions are handled is more important.
Ninja edit: other cripto currencies have tried larger blocks, and it's worked fine.  Blocks as large as 1 GB have been tried, and can work. However, the Bitcoin community doesn't want to charge.

Exchanges make money off of trades, so it's in their interest for there to be as many trades/minute as possible. They won't ban bots because the bots make them money.

The more inputs go into a transactions, the larger the fee. Most transactions only have a few inputs, but sometimes your wallet needs to combine lots of transactions to get enough. That transaction will take up much more space in the blockchain, so it has a much larger fee.

Bitcoin is limited to 1mb of transactions per 10 minutes. This works out to be about 7 transactions per second. If more than 7 transactions are generated in a second, the 7 that payed the highest fees go through.
Also, the 7/sec applys to normal transactions with few inputs. The way the blockchain works, when you send bitcoin, your transaction includes where you got the bitcoin. Most transactions only have bitcoin from one or two sources. If you have a transaction that has many sources, it has to take up a larger part of that 1 mb block. Now you need to pay enough to cover the several transactions that could take place.
If you didn't pay enough for your transaction to get included, it waits in the mempool until there are fewer transactions, and it gets included. Eventually, if it doesn't get included in a block, it drops and the bitcoin is returned to your wallet.

The limit was intended to be temporary measure until the coin matured enough. But it was never increased, leading to the problem we have now.

What would be your less simplified answer?

Because our debt is in US dollars, and we control the printing of US dollars, there is no chance of the US government not being able to pay. Printing that much money would cause a lot of inflation, which would cause its own problems, but we cannot default on our debt unless we choose to.
Also, most of that debt is owed to US citizens. There is no way any foreign country could try to leverage the US over debt owed to them.

I agree, it's deflationary nature is one of the main obstetrical to widespread use. Hyperinflation is a threat with fiat, but slow inflation is a better solution than deflation.

The high fees make unhappy customers, which creates a customer service issue that is Valve's problem. They've decided that the customer service problems are not worth whatever they make for using bitcoin.

One of the key points is you don't need to trust anyone. With your dollars, you either have to use cash, or trust a bank. The bank could stop you from accessing your money, or prevent you from sending it.
You also need to trust the government issuing the dollars. They use an inflationary monetary policy, which means that over time, dollars become worth less.
Bitcoin avoids both of those problems. There is no one agency verifying transactions, so no one agency can stop any transaction from taking place. The rate of bitcoin creation is defined, with a hard limit on how many can exist. This makes bitcoin deflationary, meaning it will increase in value over time.
There are plans in place to solve the current limit problem, but until they are complete, I agree that bitcoin is not ready to replace dollars in everyday use.

Back in either '08 or '09, it was set there to limit the number of transactions. Bitcoin was basically worthless then, so a malicious actor could attack the blockchain by spamming a huge amount of transactions. The 1 mb limit was put in place to prevent that.

How does that work? Your saying:
Some people hodl B
Some people hodl A and B
Some people hodl A
No one hodl A and B
