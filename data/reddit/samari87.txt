76% aren't familiar with bitcoin and 79% won't consider using it. 
Conclusion: the people who know the least about bitcoin hate it the most.

Give Satoshi Nakamoto a call and inform him about this bug in Bitcoin

I know the content of the video is horrible, but it's nothing but facts built on hard arguments. 
The current monetary system is designed to mislead. Dollars are created on a massive scale out of thin air daily, this debt based system never worked and never is going to work and i'm quite sure we will see (and currently are seeing) what 'good' it will bring us.
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:34:38
After you watch this your current opinion against banks Will change 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:14:57

Every idiot would triplecheck if the filled in key is the right one. 
I'm an idiot who checks it at least 5 times by comparing the first 5, couple in the middle and the last 5 numbers/letters. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:56:46
Thanks for the info, Will take a look at it. 
I just saw i have a confirmation, this is a serious issue. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:19:09
I've browsed a little on the internet, but I only stumble on paper wallets whereby its neccesary to have a second offline pc or to boot linux via an usb.
Is there another possibility I'm missing?
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:56:47
This is great.
@_date: 2014-05-21 09:14:47
It could be a good plan, if it turns out well. Otherwise it wouldn't be a good plan. Nobody knows, the crystal balls aren't invented yet.
Never invest more than you are willing to lose.

I'm thinking to buy too but i'ill wait for THE 20 dollar drop 
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:35:57
This is actually good news
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:43:07
The thing is that malware/key-loggers usually don't pop up on your screen saying they are there, so I'm not comfortable using bitaddress.org on a pc that ever was connected to the internet.
I bought 3 usb yesterday to boot via linux to store my btc offline, but I know this isn't something the everydayuser will/can do.
My concerns are more for the masses who aren't able to do this.
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:16:05
Because bitcoin isn't a debt-base fiat currency. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 17:42:01
Finally a free market that can not be shut down, I think this is going to be big if it works.

 This is how the current money system works.
Now tell me how bitcoin works....

Gambling (except poker) is always -EV longterm, so my advice would be to stay far away from it as they always have an edge on you.
