Just wait. Either it goes through, or you get it back. The wallet can't really change anything at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:00:43
I'm not counting on it, but if the disadvantages of increasing the block sizes are related to disk space and network throughput/latency, it seems reasonable to do it at some point.

I'm guessing either that, or that he is in fact a pseudonym for some US agency hodling a 10% stack of the new world economy.

That's true. The address he sent the coins to was generated by ShapeShifts private key, on the Bcash chain, but that doesn't mean they have generated the same key on the bitcoin chain, where the coins are.
I guess ShapeShift could try to generate the same address on the bitcoin chain and get to the coins that way.
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:17:21
Well said. Some very good book references there.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:32:27
Not really, someone suggested earlier to contact the authorities that took it down, but doing so while the investigation is ongoing will probably take forever.
Hopefully the coins will be made available at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:18:47
Yes, it has been taken down a few weeks ago

A few points:
Electrum never sends your private key, or seed, to anyone. It shouldn't do that, and it doesn't have to. Creating the private key (seed) offline is not a problem.
Electrum have to be online in order to get information about your address, and show you the ballance.
Electrum servers are running the standard bitcoin daemon, so if all of them went down you could still start up your own and connect to that.
The format of the seed Electrum gives you are standardized and supported by some other wallets as well. As long as you have the seed, and any wallet that supports that format, you should be able to restore your account.

It won't be unconfirmed forever. If it doesn't get included in a block within a few days, it disappears from the memory pool. At that point it is as if it was never broadcasted, and the senders address still has the coins.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:16:51
Do not try and buy the dip, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth... there is no dip.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:48:00
Electrum doesn't support BCC at all, it will only send Bitcoin.
If you sent from Electrum to a Bitcoin Cash address on ShapeShift, the coins are probably gone. Nobody has them anymore.

I think it will wear off eventually.
In my opinion, second layers will have to take care of most small, daily transactions when privacy and security is not a concern, but it should be possible to do on-chain transactions for no more than a few dollars. Preferably less of course.
Also, there are companies out there specializing on analyzing the blockchain and reporting back to big brother, so privacy could easily end up being worse on-chain if we don't come up with a solution.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:48:52
Could be. He may have been trying to educate us for some time already
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:53:17
They are on the address you sent it to, but on the Bitcoin blockchain not on the BCash blockchain.
ShapeShift has the private key for that address on the BCash blockchain, but not for the Bitcoin blockchain.
So, it exists, but it is on a address nobody has the private key for :(
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:31:55
The 2x part is pathetic. It has no technical reasoning what so ever, and means nothing in terms of scaling. All it does is to rush a HF that doesn't contain anything from the HF wishlist. Pleasing the miners this way may work once, but we can't afford this kind of childs play in the long run. Chances are that many of the relevant people today will be gone in a year or two, we really need to reach for a higher standard here.
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:54:05
I'm pretty sure there will be block size increases in addition to several second layer solutions. If lightning doesn't serve a speciffic market or demand, someone will create something that does.
The block size should be as big as possible without leading to mining or node centralization and I don't think there is anyone disagreeing with that. However, we need to be conservative about this, and most people seems to think SegWit was the next step.
Personally, I also think we should forget about making bitcoin do everything for everyone. This challenge is hard enough as it is just trying to make it work as electronic cash.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:31:01
We are not talking about a scam. It's just how the bitcoin network works. Don't worry.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:03:10
There is a way to reduce the number of transactions stored in the blocks, basically by rearranging inputs and outputs in the payment network before it is stored in the blockchain, kind of like refactoring an equation. 
The core team have more interesting stuff incoming, like MimbleWimble.
Leaving it to the users and investors to decide on things like this is a really bad idea.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:12:36


Your right, it doesn't make any sense at all, it should have been "try to import".
How rude of me to make that mistake!
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:30:28
It is possible to envision bad scenarios, but the truth is that the cat is already out of the bag. Anyone who doesn't deliver what the market wants will find themself on the wrong side of history sooner or later.

@_date: 2017-08-30 05:02:17
Yeah, you should talk to them, they would know if there is anything that can be done.
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:12:36
This is all wrong. The core team spent a lot of time on researching, implemeting and testing SegWit, a solution they presented to the public right away. They had no reason to believe it would be blocked two years later, and there is no reason to think anyone has been trying to delay anything.
This kind of work takes huge amounts of time and energy. Any decent person would try to contribute instead of running around making up conspiracy theories and using all kinds of dirty tricks to push for another quick fix.
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:52:32
I'm not sure they want it to fail through. It could be that they have already accepted the demize of fiat and want the thing to grow right into the hands of players they already control, or are aligned with, like Microsoft and the Chinese communist party.

As I see it, UBI, and socialism for that matter, is tied to a model that doesn't scale. There is a reason free markets have existed for centuries, the more actors and transactions you add to the mix, the better and more efficient they get. This is not the case for any kind of centrally planned economy.
There is a need for governments, but we need them to do pretty much the opposite of what they are currently doing.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:54:24
I didn't say that. What I am getting at is that there is no alternative to free and open markets when it comes to creating a system that can scale indefinitely, and that can determine the correct price for goods and services.
Of course, agreements like TTIP and what not has nothing to do with free and open markets. Those are all about special interest groups being handed guarantees and benefits behind closed doors.
When it comes to UBI, where does the money come from?
How are those monies evaluated correctly?
Who decides who gets what when, and what will that cost in man hours and resources, and how are those resources payed for?
I can't see how this would be any different than projects like the Soviet Union and Eastern Germany, and we all know how that ended. They went bankrupt, even if they refuse to admit it.
Basically, I support the idea of providing a safety net for people, but I don't see how UBI will solve any problems. Isn't it just another food-stamp system? And if so, where does the food come from, who produced it, why, and at what cost?

Hey, you removed the video!
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:14:05
I respected him back in 2012, now I don't understand why. 
My impression of him lately is that he doesn't care at all about decentralization or censorship resistance, every time anyone mentions that he comes up with some twisted argument about how lower fees will automatically solve all that. If money is all he cares about, he should be happy that competent people takes care of things and leave the community alone. He can't have scaling in a hurry, regardless how many coins he has.
Investors should leave development of complex systems to those who has spent 20+ years and a PhD learning how to do it. Most investors knows this, but not Roger.
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:58:55
Sounds to me you didn't even watch the video
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:28:31
What a complete moron. He doesn't even understand what he has invested in.
Bitcoin investors has invested in the concept of self sovereign money, and the developers ability to continue to deliver that. That is what Roger Ver invested in, nothing else.

1. The core software is only version 0.15, and far from ready for main stream adoption.
2. Surrounding infrastructure is not ready for the average user.
3. Marketing in general tends to give people high expectations, or even wrong expectations in the case of cryptocurrencies, leading to confusion followed by misguided regulations.
4. Marketing a currency sounds weird and implies someone is profiting from you buying into it, which again leads to wrong expectations. I think education is a better way to go about it.

Regulation has made it close to impossible for average Joe to participate, and introduces a long sequence of old-style insecure hurdles that can be abused by anyone snooping for personal, compromising information.

I don't have the link to it right now, but basically, after EU made some of the Swedish surveillance methods illegal, they have been working on replacing those methods, including going after VPNs
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:52:11
You still have them, if you import your private key into a BCash wallet. 
The BCash blockchain has never sent your coin on to someone else, so the BCash network still consider it to be yours, and will allow you to spend it again, basically.

This would not be a problem if smaller miners could pick them up, but the way things work now that is not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:26:43
You can export/import your private keys between most wallets, but don't try to move your private keys to an exchange. You have to send the coins the regular way.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:05:01
Maybe, but the regulation we get now only makes easy things hard, without providing security for average Joe.
