I've had the same problem just now.
I received my first order of 10 BTC about 2 weeks ago, did instant verification and they logged into my bank account.  (Pretty much broke even on my buying price at the time).
Now, last Wednesday I put in an order for 10BTC, and then another 10BTC on Thursday when my BTC limit reached 10.
Fast forward to today, it's supposed to clear at 6:00PM and I get an e-mail at 5:51PM or so saying that it was "high-risk" and that they're refunding my money in 3-5 days.
I e-mailed them asking why and what they're willing to do to make things right.  Didn't say what, but it'd be nice if like others had said, they'd let me place an order for 10BTC at the price I locked in last week when they've verified me after 30 days or refund me my money plus the difference in BTC gain that I'm losing cause of them (ie. ~$30 USD).
I then started looking things up and see that pretty much Reddit is the only place where people have posted similar experience (and I don't use Reddit so I'm sure people will accuse me of trolling as well).
Now I'm concerned that they'll cancel my other order that's going to clear tomorrow with the exact same explanation costing me another ~$30+ USD since prices are slowly climbing daily.
That on top of having spent a week waiting for the coins to end up with no coins and then having to place another order, wait 3-5 more days, and hope they don't cancel that on me is a bit annoying.

Update: Woke up this morning and saw that they had responded to my e-mail and apologized and pushed the canceled transaction through.
They also said that I should have no issues with my 2nd transaction that should be clearing today so I assume they changed my risk profile like they did for another user.
