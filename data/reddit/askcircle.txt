Hey OP,
Thanks for bringing this up. That's definitely not the experience we want you to have. Could you please direct message us your email so I can have account services take a look and get this taken care of for you?
Looking forward to getting this resolved!

Hey OP,
Happy to help you! Please DM us your email address associated with Circle so that a member of our team can conduct a manual review of your account and get you up and running.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:58:11
Hey, thanks for getting in touch!
Sounds like everything is running normally. It typically takes 3 - 5 business days for the funds to be deposited from your bank account and arrive at Circle. 
Some customers have reported that their bank statement shows the transaction has completed before the fiat transfer has actually finished on Circle's side. This does not mean that the transfer of funds has actually completed. 
If the 3-5 business day window has passed and you still don't see the deposit reflected in your Circle account balance, please feel free to reach back out and we will look into it!

Hi cryptotraveler,
Your balance is held in BTC. As the BTC/USD exchange rate fluctuates, your fiat balance will also fluctuate. Your BTC balance will always remain the same.  A full discussion with pictures can be seen here:

Hi Folks,
Circle's insurance policy applies to both U.S. and international customers ( Section 11). 
Additionally our CEO explains a bit more here: 
Insurance Clarity
Back in May, we were excited to announce that we were offering customers insurance from theft on 100 percent of their bitcoin account balances. Since May, we’ve continued to build out our insurance program, acquiring more underwriters for both our online and cold storage / offline assets. Today we offer this unprecedented insurance coverage to every Circle customer. Circle customers will have 100 percent coverage of their full deposit value. Our insurance broker is Marsh, one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. The underwriters for this insurance are all highly-rated. Insurance on Bitcoin is a new market, and we’re proud to be a market maker in establishing this valuable service to users of digital assets. And this 100 percent insurance covers deposits for any user in the world holding bitcoin with Circle. (
We're excited to have a global customer base and hope you enjoy the service!
Team Circle
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:52:15
Hi pancakeman316,
Valid concern - customers on the platform can review the documentation; our insurance policy is written by Marsh. Hope that helps ease your concerns!

Hi LogitechG27,
Sorry to hear about the duplicate charge. We will certainly work with you to rectify the situation. Please drop us an email (support and we'll look right into it.
Team Circle
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:13:33
Hi Folks, thanks for the concern. Please be aware that Circle, from the day we began accepting customer deposits, has fully insured those deposits. We cover 100% of customer assets under management, so long as any loss does not occur from obvious customer negligence leading to account compromise. Our policy is written by a world leading insurance broker - Marsh. We understand the confusion around some of the terms of service - we will clarify those today but be advised all customer deposits have been fully insured from day one.
@_date: 2014-07-23 21:06:16
Hey dangero,
We are insured through Marsh Insurance. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:23:50
Hi Folks,
Thanks for the information - we'll work to incorporate this on our support site. As each card issuing bank treats purchases differently, having a broad customer base reporting their experiences is extremely helpful. Please be aware that certain banks will impose a foreign transaction fee for USD purchases. Keep in mind linking bank accounts works for US customers only.

Hey MikeD209!
So excited to have you onboard! You can send BTC to your wallet instantly without fees, just make sure you are in the "Send" tab. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:47:02
We've become aware that some credit card issuing banks are erroneously processing settlements as cash advances. It is not our intent to process charges as cash advances whatsoever, and we're investigating the issue. We understand the frustration. Since this issue does not occur across all issuing banks, and since we are not notified when it occurs, it would be helpful for any affected customers to let us know by way of email to support
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:22:28
Thanks for pointing that out - that's definitely not the experience we want you to have. We're fixing it right now and it will be corrected in our next app update.
@_date: 2014-09-03 22:11:23
Hey lllO_Olll,
You don't have to link a bank account first. You can link either a credit card or bank account in whatever order you choose.
It is true too that linking a bank account can take 3 days to verify. We send two small deposits which need to be confirmed in your Settings &gt; Linked Accounts.
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:05:43
Hey austinb303,
To clarify here, when you input 1 BTC there is an amount in fiat that must be paid. This is the price a customer is agreeing to pay. Since the fiat amount price is locked into a relationship with Circle's conversion price, when the conversion price changes, instead of changing the fiat value, the BTC value adjusts.
Also note the amount of BTC might vary slightly between your buy and settlement of BTC into your account.
If there are any questions, please get in touch with us at support[at]circle[dot]com.

Glad to hear about your interest in Circle.
Since you are under 18, you will need parental consent in order to link an account with Circle.  Please email us from the email associated with your Circle account and we will send one over to you.  If you could have a parent fill out and sign the document and submit it to us along with a scan or photo of their valid government-issued photo ID through a secure link that we provide, we'd be happy to help you set up an account.
Now, regarding your follow up comments on this thread, Circle -- in no way, shape, or form -- sanctions the use of our service to purchase fake IDs.  Any usage of our service to such ends will result in immediate suspension of your account.  I urge you to consult sections 16 and 17 of your user agreement for more information.
Other than that, hope you enjoy the product.  Let us know if you have any questions or concerns moving forward.

@_date: 2015-05-28 01:52:09
Great question! No charges are made by Circle but your credit card issuer will charge a processing fee and may charge a cash advance fee. The processing fee is 2.9% but not all card deposits are subject to a cash advance fee. Check out this [help article]( if you would like to know more.
@_date: 2015-05-28 01:57:42
Thanks for asking! We are increasing deposit limits based on an individual customer's transactional history and account age. Shoot us an email to support to see if your Circle account is eligible.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:09:48
Hey OP,
Thanks for asking. 
Moving funds into your Circle account comes at no cost to you and you can securely store, send, and receive your funds entirely for free.
Furthermore, I just want to make you feel comfortable that your funds are safe with us. At Circle we take the security of our customer’s accounts very, very seriously.
Allow me to point out some of our features:
Offline Storage:
Most funds are stored offline in physically-protected (cold storage) vaults geographically distributed around the world, and all offline funds are managed as multi-signature transactions.
Account Policies:
For customer accounts, Circle enforces strict password, account lockout, session token, password reset, and secret question policies. Additionally, accounts are required to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.
Online Storage:
Customer personal information (including address and phone number) and bank account information is stored in encrypted format, using multiple layers of encryption, and is never decrypted in any archive or other data format. Circle does not store customer credit card information at all, but rather stores a card reference in the form of a cryptographic hash that is useless by itself. Circle's live systems are protected according to the best practices currently available to software and systems engineering, and Circle's systems are periodically audited and tested by external security experts certified to provide such testing.
Money in your Circle account is insured at no cost to you. We take every precaution to keep your money safe, but in the event that something unfortunate happens, we've got you covered. Our insurance policy is provided by Marsh and underwritten by leading underwriters who thoroughly review and audit our security procedures. **Additionally, we do have provisions for returning our customers’ funds back to them in the case of insolvency.**
As a company, Circle is regulated by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s FinCEN and is registered as a Money Services Business. Circle’s finances are publicly audited annually. Circle’s online and offline funds are independently audited. All Circle employees have passed stringent background checks, are required to use encrypted laptops among other IT protections, and follow the principles of least privilege.
Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions about our procedures. We will be happy to talk to you and quell any insecurities you may have in holding funds with us. We believe our customers deserve the best and we want to deliver that to them.
If you have any feedback or suggestions about how we can make our systems even more secure, please let us know. We value what our customers have to say.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:36:44

Hey there! The app simply accesses your account but Circle never stores bitcoin directly in the app so your Circle account would be safe if anything were to happen to the phone. Thanks for checking!
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:09:49
You will not be able to add a credit card, as we no longer support the linking of credit cards on Circle. Our goal as a company is to make moving money fast, easy and free. Between the 2.9% processing fee that comes with credit card transactions, and the possibility of a cash advance fee applied by your card issuer, credit cards do not align with our above goals.
You are still able to link standard debit cards from the United States, United Kingdom, and some European countries.
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:55:16
But actually. We know more ;)
You can find your account's BTC address in the dropdown menu at the top right hand corner. Here's a how-to [gif](

Hey OP,
Shoot us a DM with your email and we will look into your account for you!
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:01:10
Hey OP,
Happy to answer your questions.
1) Yes, there are weekly limits that reset on a rolling basis. As a new customer you can deposit up to $100 per week with a credit card and $2500 from a bank account -- $100 of which is instantly available. As you develop greater transactional history with us over time, we will be happy to reevaluate your limit and see if you qualify for an increase.
2) At Circle, we determine a single competitive buy/sell price for our customers with no bid/ask spread. We arrive at this price by aggregating data from a range of leading exchanges. There are absolutely no fees charged by Circle, but credit card deposits and withdrawals are subject to a 2.9% processing fee.
3) Circle does not support pre-paid cards, gift cards, or non-US cards. In the meantime, all US issued VISA and MasterCard credit or debit cards and most bank checking accounts are fully supported. Many of our international customers have had success when linking cards through VISA and Mastercard, however there is no guarantee that it will be successful.
Please let us know if you have any follow up questions and we will be more than happy to answer them. Also, feel free to get in touch with us via our support center. Our phone lines are currently open and so is our live chat option. Additionally, you can always email us at support
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:44:24
Hey OP,
Looks like some of the other responders were on the right track, but allow us to further clarify.
Yes, you can withdraw funds (sell your BTC) back to a linked credit/debit card. All customers start with a $1,000 weekly withdrawal limit and there is a 2.9% processing fee. After you confirm your transaction, it will take 1 - 3 business days for the funds to arrive.
You may also withdraw funds to a linked bank account. All customers start with a $5,000 weekly withdrawal limit and there is no processing fee. After you confirm your transaction, it will take 3 - 5 business days for the funds to arrive and reflect in your balance.
Please let us know if that clears things up for you or if you, or anyone else, have any further questions for us.
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:23:06
Hey OP,
Thanks for pointing that out. Do you mind DMing us your device specs (iOS or Android) and your Circle associated email address so we can take a closer look?
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:18:16
Hey OP,
Just wanted to clarify further on this subject!
We are not averse to that type of arbitrage or trading activity and our TOS is not referring to that. It is only referring to buying and selling activity that would require an MSB registration.
Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Hey OP,
Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
It takes 3-5 business days for the funds from your bank account to reach Circle, at which point you will see the deposit reflected in your Circle account balance. Some customers have reported that their bank statement shows the transaction has completed before the fiat transfer has actually finished on Circle's side. This does not mean that the transfer of funds has actually completed.
Regarding your instant access, we would be happy to see why you are no longer receiving it. Please DM us your email so that we may take a look.

Hey there! Since we are a federally regulated company we need to verify the identity of all of our users. If we're unable to do so by the information you've provided we are required to ask for further verification (ie. ID + selfie). If you don't wish to send them in simply email support and we can refund and close the account for you!
@_date: 2015-11-17 22:09:03
Hey OP,
Sounds like your account balance is currently denominated in USD.
What you can do is convert your account balance to bitcoin via your account settings in the "currency" tab.
Alternatively, you can send that $100 to any bitcoin address as though it were bitcoin but without your balance being impacted by bitcoin price volatility.
The choice is yours. If you have any other questions shoot us an email to support
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:36:13
Hey OP,
Yes, you would have $110 in your account. When switching your account balance, we will provide you with an exchange rate for the conversion and the amount of funds in dollars or bitcoin that you will receive if you convert.
Please keep in mind that this is considered a taxable event, and that you will be unable to convert your balance if you have any pending transactions.

Hey OP,
We are happy to assist you with your issue, but first allow us to explain what happened with that charge on your statement.
Circle registers credit card charges immediately when you submit the transaction request. At this point, the money is taken and held by your bank in escrow for a few days before they send it to us (called a 'pre-authorization' charge). When that escrow time has passed and your bank or card issuer sees that the transaction was cancelled, instead of sending the money to us, your bank or card issuer will send the money back into your account. This means that it often takes  3 - 5 business days for the money that you attempted to deposit to appear back in your account.
As for why this transaction was cancelled to begin with, please shoot us an email to support so that we may take a closer look, determine what went wrong, and help you get this resolved.
Cheers! 
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:19:56

Hey OP,
Thanks for asking.  The funds that you received are due to the instant access that Circle credits you when you initiate a bank deposit.  Your checking account will be charged when the banks reopen and your purchase is processed.
After that, it will take 3 - 5 business days for the funds to reach your Circle account and become reflected in your balance.
If you have any other questions, please feel free to direct them towards us at any time.
Additionally, do you mind messaging us the email associated with your Circle account so that we can close out your support request?

Hey OP,
You can hold however many funds you like in your Circle account.
Additionally, weekly limits reset on a rolling 7 day period -- doesn't matter what day of the week. For example, if you make a deposit at 7pm, your limit will reset at 7pm 7 days later.
Also, we will increase a customer's limits on an individual basis as they build greater transactional history and trust with our service.

Hey OP,
Happy to help you.
As many commenters on this thread have suggested, selling bitcoin on Circle is as easy as withdrawing funds from your Circle account to one of the payment methods (credit/debit cards or bank accounts) you have linked to your account.

Hey OP,
Thanks for asking.  
It is possible to link a debit card to Circle, but at this time, our system only supports the linking of US issued payment methods. We are working hard to incorporate international partnerships and some of our international customers have reported success linking their credit/debit cards, but the majority are unsupported.
Let us know if you have any follow up questions.

Hey OP,
Not all card issuers charge them so we cannot predict how a particular one will view your transaction with Circle.  
If you’d like to know ahead of time if your issuer will charge you a fee, you can call the number on the back of your credit card and ask how they will classify charges from Circle Internet Financial (Merchant Category Code 6051). Some customers have retroactively called their issuer and successfully explained that their deposit with Circle was not a cash advance.
Let us know if there is anything else we can do to help.

It appears as though you are getting this error because your debit card may not be supported by our system.  Typically, customers with international cards receive this error.  Does your card happen to fall within this category?

Hey OP and everyone,
We rolled out some changes last week that affected limits. Our team wrote a [blog post]( and sent out an email describing these updates. Limits for adding money, cashing out and sending funds are now the same. This means current limits for newer customers are set to $300 per week and a request can be made to increase this limit.
OP's situation sounds a bit unique, but regularly, to request a limit increase, please follow these steps:
 - In your account, go to Settings
 - Then the "limits" tab (where you will see your current limits and the usage of each)
 - Click on Request Increase. This will take you to a form where we ask for a few more details.
 - After you submit your information, we will conduct a review and see if you qualify for an increase.
In your case, OP, since you were unaware of the new limits and have sent more funds in then you can send out, please get in touch with us. It's not our intention to "lock" your funds, and we are happy to adjust spend limits to make your account work for you.
If there are more general questions, feel free to tweet at us. Our support team is

Hey OP,
Happy to answer your question.
We will be increasing customer deposit limits on an individual basis as they develop greater transaction history with us.  
Also, to answer your question regarding cash advance fees, the fees incurred are a determination of our Merchant Category Code (MCC) made by your card issuer that is out of our control. Cash advance fees cannot be prevented by Circle.  The way to prevent these fees moving forward is to use a bank account for deposits and withdrawals.
If you feel strongly about this circumstance, the best person to get in touch with is your card issuer to see what they can do. You will need to know our MCC 6051.
Additionally, if you have any follow up questions, please shoot us an email at support visit our help center at  or follow us on Twitter 
Best regards.
