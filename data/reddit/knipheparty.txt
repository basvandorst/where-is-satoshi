but there has to be somewhere to invest a frivolous amount of bitcoin?

if im working on a project, i charge. i tax big. but if a project is too challenging or i cant find motivation, I will outsource it, for literally, close to nothing. unless he sourced this kid from beheance there is no way i can imagine paying that much. i mean, if he is making like a 12 minute long animation,  i guess i see where you're coming from.

i looked up the site on bitcoin forums a lot. they received very high marks for security and they have a large amount of start up money.
apply at mcdonalds, wait a week for a call back, interview, go to orientation and training, get hired. took you 3 weeks and you made nothing so far. 
i made 500,000 satoshi with faucets which was more than enough to get me started up in investments. if it fails and goes to shit i wasted about as much time as i would have spent playing league of legends all night and i invested $0 real dollars. 
so ...maybe...2/10?
any other recommendations for the same sort of investment option for small amounts of satoshi that has more reliability?

protip video! what does this mean though? what is the risk if there is no investment?

I guess I just kind of assumed it was like a wallstreet type deal where they just used several small amounts of other people's money to invest in a more profitable investment, which is lower than the return we would receive. presuming if I'm making .15% return, then they must me making 7.9% return. i don't see how .15% return (their roi) is outsized. It's actually quite small isn't it? as opposed to say a COD? 
on a side note, how much for the bridge and where does it go?

I can't imagine either. I literally pay like $5-$15 for work done on Fiverr.

how would you correlate that to say something like, renting/leasing/buying a share of cloud mining? which also offers a marginally insignificant return.
