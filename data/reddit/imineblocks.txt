You can use the exact same argument the day before BCC collapses. I think you are missing the point entirely.

Hey were you the guy saying BCC was not a scam as well? I see you have moved on to tether now. Referral link?
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:12:03
That guy could not audit the inside of an empty shoe box
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:25:09
rumor has it this guy: 
is heading up the Audit of Tether
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:55:08
so are they a crypto friendly bank? I see a lot of banks closing accounts if they are related to crypto in any way
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:09:47
why would you leave your life savings on an exchange? If you dont own your private key you have no control.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:36:15
It is all related, if not directly buying/selling hash power using BTC etc.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:47:42
Yep, that is exactly what happens. They are not dumb.
They can have inventory working for them until somebody buys it at a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:36:52
The bitcoin bubble is held to the ground by tether, if the tether breaks the bubble raises until the FUD pressure of the surroundings drops while the bitcoin FUD inside expands and the bubble breaks.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:51:37
agreed Tether will take down more accounts than BCC though.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:19:47
Same guy probably thought BCC was legit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:27:54
enough said ;)
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:00:21
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:07:38
What you just described is what happens when it collapses.
Your argument is basically: It has not collapsed so it must be ok.
Exact same argument BCC people are no doubt used to.

@_date: 2018-01-25 07:12:25
who writes this crap?
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:55:52
My point with BCC is that everybody thought it was fine, except those who said it was a scam.
Same thing with Tether, people are saying it is fine without any evidence it is, you know, actually legit. Lots of red flags.
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:10:11
lolz no way it is that quiet. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:46:03

ask Jean Louis about tether?
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:53:35
BCC stayed up until it collapsed. Even though everybody knew it was a scam. Tether will stay at $1 until it goes to $0. If you want to keep a dead seagull as a pet thats your call. Don't care.

wass wass wass up?  
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:05:52
Tether needs the audit, not the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:04:38
1) Check parking lot
2) Check for lambos
3) Watch who gets into lambo
4) bust..
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:44:20
and diamonds right?
Sorry about your simplistic world outlook. Do some research and come back k?
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:45:19
well thought out response, you forgot to include your referral code though.

What could possibly go wrong?

Then invest time into not buying a car and walking/bus, wait and buy a lambo which is faster and will save you time. In fact you wont even need to be anywhere if you have enough for a lambo so you stay home and watch cat videos at 2X speed saving even more time. Profit.

but what if nobody wants a BTC then what?
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:06:24
Trade a potentially appreciating asset in a new class (crypto) for something that will not only fall in value but cost money to maintain.  That is some sound fiscal reasoning. Buy a bus pass, buy crypto. This is not financial advice. lolz

also CC is insured/charge back. If you are having trouble using a CC life is going to be hard.
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:42:41
being reversible is critical for a lot of transactions. Buying drugs/cash purchases sure BTC is great. Buying a new fridge and it does not show up, call CC dont pay. If you pay your CC during grace period it is free interest. CC has a ton of advantages. Love BTC but we have a ways to go
