I and many others are all for the SegWit rollout and Lightning, but your response doesn't answer the fundamental question: why is Core so reluctant to raise the blocksize limit in the interim?
I have not read a single logical reason beyond conspiracy theories. *What is so horrible about raising the blocksize to 2MB (or even 1.5MB) before rolling out SegWit?* Anything to reduce congestion a bit. Once you do that, then you introduce SegWit in the spring, and Lightning at some point in the future, and everyone would be firmly behind Core.
People gravitate towards conspiracy theories because of Core's refusal to give an inch on this single issue. Even if it has nothing to do with Blockstream, it comes off like they're closing ranks for some secretive reason.

Is there any coherent reason that you removed StarMaged from the mod list?
Should I even bother asking?

Why the Core team didn't go for a blocksize increase in the interim is beyond me. "*Because SegWit in April*" is not an answer, as that will take many, many months to be fully adopted by everyone, and even when its effects have propagated through the whole system, does not allow more transactions per block than a regular block size increase.
That simple block size increase to 2MB, or even 1.5MB for the truly paranoid, would have rendered most of this infighting moot. If there are actual reasons other than the conspiracy theories why they won't budge, I have not heard them.
"But we're firing the core devs~~!!!" seems to be the latest FUD. With demand, Bitcoin could hypothetically fork back *into* whatever Core's improvements are in the future.
