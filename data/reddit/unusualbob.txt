Probably the reason they are doing this is to fight the 'bitcoin is just for drugs other illegal thing' argument. Keeping the early merchants restricted to vanilla companies means they can start to promote an image of bitcoin that is quite a step away from silk road.
It's also possible there are additional regulations that apply if they accept payment for these kind of things that they want to avoid.

You have to realize that for most businesses BTC is a neat potential revenue stream, but scary because they don't want to get ripped off. They will go to someone like Bitpay because of the perceived reduced risk by converting directly to a currency they are more familiar with and less afraid of (such as USD) as well as getting merchant tools which allow them to track revenue. As they warm up to the idea that BTC isn't so scary, they can change their settlement settings to give them a portion or all of their income in BTC.

Bitpay allows merchants to accept fiat, btc, or a combination of both. The big issue is that most merchants have bills that need to be paid in fiat, so as long as that is the case they will take most if not all of their settlements in fiat. As btc becomes more viable for use by merchants, such as landlords accepting btc for rent, the percentage of btc not converted to fiat will increase. Some merchants already take a large percentage of their sales in btc but still use bitpay as it gives them POS tools than just a pc with a wallet.

Every single service in the entire world that was using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL was at risk. Every single one. Any and all data transmitted or stored while heartbleed was unpatched should theoretically be considered compromised.
You have to realize that bitcoin is not going to be seen as the highest priority for the media in an event like this. Banks were affected, big email providers were affected, millions and millions of servers. Bitcoin is low on the totem pole when it comes to the media and this security hole.
If you are worried, transfer all coins from backed-up wallets to new wallets. Also, encrypt your backups, that way even if another bug like this exists there's a second layer of protection.
The big thing you should know about this attack is that the data people were able to get back from the server was mostly random, as in the attacker did not have the ability to ask for specific files, etc. They would send a specially crafted request and get a random chunk of 64KB of memory back from the server. They would then pour over that data and check it for useful information. It was somewhat a game of luck what they got back, but due to the unknown nature of what attackers got, everything is considered compromised. The chances your data was actually captured is very low, but its always safer to assume it was.

No, basically Bitcore is designed to be a nice tool to let developers who don't understand the low-level bitcoin stuff very well to still be able to create cool things for bitcoin. 
Bitcore does things like letting you generate keypairs, create transactions and broadcast them, monitor transactions, etc all without knowing about ECDSA secp256k1 or how to build messages which comply with the bitcoin protocol spec. Its basically taking a lot of common bitcoin functionality and making them more accessible to the average developer.

Money laundering will always happen, the only question is to what degree. Physical fiat is the simplest and most common way right now. Bitcoin is just the first digital form of cash and with it comes a lot of discussion on how it will behave like cash. 
There are some checks in place in certain countries for cash exchanges, like when buying gift cards at some places with cash you have to give a valid photo ID. The real question is at what point to those checks become so burdensome that they hamper an innovation like bitcoin.
Governments and tech companies that bitcoin competes with (credit cards, banks, etc) will try to regulate and get as much information as possible. Governments will do it because they want that information, they would love to have information about every possible financial transaction. If you follow the money you know who is doing what. Companies like Mastercard will just lobby for regulation, since things like overzealous [KYC]( makes using bitcoin a pain in the ass for companies and removes one of the great features of bitcoin, in that it doesn't require the business to know anything about the person in order to process the payment.
Eventually a middle ground will be found, hopefully only some purchases from some companies will require KYC. KYC does a good job in cases like this, if Karples has to prove identities for all of his customers he can't really launder the money as easily as he'd like. If he's audited and half his customers don't really exist he's screwed. At the same time most of us don't want the government or Karples to have any of our personal information (because he might steal that too :P), so we wouldn't want KYC in that case. 
Its seen as a double standard because the average bitcoiner isn't doing anything wrong, so we feel as if we're being treated as criminals when someone wants to track all the information about our cash purchases. I would be really pissed if every time I bought a soda at the gas station I had to give them a photo ID. At the same time we see Mr. Karples, in some minds a bitcoin thief and asshole, potentially laundering money in an obvious way and that really sucks. People call for regulation of his practices not really realizing that the same practices that would be used to wrangle him are the same ones that piss them off. People idealize that there is some better middle ground, but as far as I'm aware there really isn't much of one, unless someone comes up with a cool decentralized proof of identity without revealing information :P.
Whatever the case may be, I'm sure the tax and other authorities that be are VERY interested in Mr. Karples. If they aren't they are idiots (very plausible seeing as they are govt).

Afaik there is no way to make the phone act like a passive NFC tag. It can act like an NFC smartcard, wherein it has methods which another device can call, but it can't act like a dumb passive tag. This means if you want to use NFC card emulation the other device must have be in card reader mode and call the specified method in order to read, which is far more complicated (and unlikely since the bitcoin ecosystem is diverse) than just sticking the device in P2P mode.
If there's an example of NFC tag emulation you're aware of I'd love to see it.

This might be a minority opinion, but this is still open source. It has a different license which doesn't allow for commercial use, but its still open source. You can read every line and compile it yourself. They simply changed the terms to prevent other companies from making a profit from their development time.
The point of open source in a product like this is to allow the community to see that the software on the device is trustworthy and potentially to help find security issues to make everyone safer.

The only way that doubling can happen at that rate is if more than 50% of the 6480 blocks are the max size every single time. The only way that many blocks will be that size is if there is a 51% attack, and then there are bigger problems.
Seeing as so many miners like SPV mining, a whole chunk of blocks will be the smallest possible size without anyone even trying to pull down the block size. Plus some people will want the size to be smaller and so will intentionally mine SPV.
You need to remember that this is median, not average. Lets take a look at a realistic scenario. Let's say there are 10 blocks in the lookback, one miner controls a whopping 40% of hashpower and wants bigger blocks, the others just mine normal blocks according to demand. What will each round look like?
round| blocks|median|average|new size
1 | 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.5, 0.9, 0.7, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 | 0.85 | 0.74 | 1.7
Ok, looks like the one miner has managed to push the size up to 1.7MB. Wowl thats some movement, I wonder how this will play out next block size check?
round| blocks|median|average|new size
2 | 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.5, 0.9, 0.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7 | 0.85 | 1.02 | 1.7
Wait it didn't change at all, how is that possible? He mined blocks almost twice as large this time!
Even with the attacker now making blocks at 1.7MB instead of 1MB they don't really affect the block size because this is a median. Only when a majority of miners are creating larger blocks does the size actually go up.

It isn't immediately compulsory for wallets, but as time goes on it becomes less and less usable. Just like it isn't compulsory to use P2SH, but I can't think of a single wallet in use right now that doesn't support it because they realized not updating would cause usability problems for users.










And so on
Blockchain explorers on the other hand have absolutely have no choice in the matter, just like if they didn't support P2SH then they would be effectively broken today. Since bitpay's copay and insight are built on the same library, bitcore, and they have to update insight or it stops working, it makes sense to go ahead and update copay.
@_date: 2016-03-24 21:57:39
Despite being called a soft fork, updating to support segwit is required otherwise the wallet will no longer really work correctly.
All blockchain viewers will require updates to support segwit or when it goes live they will be missing a good portion of transactions.

Assuming you can get into a block. The reality is a lot of wallets get fees wrong and if the blocks are even minorly congested then they get delayed. Sometimes this is more than 24 hours, a great example of this happening is here: 
You can try to blame the user here, but the average user does not and will not take the time to learn about fees. You'll see at the end of that video they basically think they've been scammed all because they didn't understand that fees mattered. These aren't dumb guys either.


I'd love to see a source on this, because it's complete bullshit. Zero confirmation payments are completely based on trust. With RBF being added its even more so, there are even open source tools to do it: 
As it stands, bitcoin cannot compete with credit cards in terms of simplicity of point of sale transactions. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It can compete online where goods need to be shipped and so waiting for confirmations isn't a big deal and chargebacks are far more common.

I hear a lot of people saying that, but what will people do if miners do stick to the NYA? Suddenly 90%+ of hash power would no longer be protecting the core chain. It seems like the only thing that could be done would be a proof of work modification by core, otherwise the core chain would be too vulnerable to a 51% attack.

Currently coin.dance/blocks shows 92% of last 1000 blocks to be signaling segwit2x. Unless I'm missing something, that means that unless the miners change their behavior again, the amount of hashing power dedicated to the 'core' network will be approximately 8% of what it is now, leaving bitcoin in a state where a 51% attack would be quite viable. I get that core doesn't like 2x but it just seems dangerous to isolate the core chain like this.

You can probably email bitpay about it to ask for info. They usually want to know your txid or invoice id, but without asking them [a quick look at tradeblock shows that the mempool is *very* full]( right now (62,000 txs waiting to confirm), so thats probably the real issue here. When it does confirm if the invoice doesnt update just email them for a refund.
I dont know that paying a second time will help unless you include a fee large enough to bypass the large pile of txs currently in the pool.
@_date: 2019-02-23 14:37:05
The reason they started using bip70 for all txs is because a huge number of people sent the wrong amount when paying. They basically said it was such a support burden that it was better to have decreased payment volumes due to users not being able to pay than to deal with having to refund so many payments. They handled $1 billion last year and the error rate they said before turning it on was like 8-9% which would be refunding a $80-90 million dollars worth of invoices. After it was 0.2 percent, or $200k worth of invoices. If the majority of those payments are under $100 that is a fuck ton of support avoided due to preventing user error. 
Also worth mentioning that bip70 is supported by several wallets including bitcoin core. I think core was the first one as bitpay didn't even have a wallet back when that bip  made

It's only not profitable because you have to pay for electricity. If it's other people's electricity then there isn't a cost. It's not going to net you a lot of hash power, but it's free, so any shares they generate in a pool would be pure profit. Sure there may be a cost for the malware, but  you don't need the best as there are a lot of old people out there.

In that case Blockstream, and the developers working for them, have a direct incentive not to increase the block size.
