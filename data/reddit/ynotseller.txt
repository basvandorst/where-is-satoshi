No it's nothing like that, they approved of that app and BitPay has publicly stated that this app has nothing to do with them and are trying to take it down.
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:13:42
Please feel free to share as we want to get the message of all of our different options out to merchants.

He's an awesome guy who knows a surprising amount about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:16:28
Nope, knowing a modest amount about bitcoin at this point puts you ahead of 99% of people.

Are you seeing what's happening in China right now?
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:33:24
As a Warren kid born and raised you have no idea how happy this makes me to see!!!

Trolls be trolling.

I am moving out of state for a position in 2 weeks....big change but a big move up for me. Very hopeful toward the future.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:47:02
I hope "fuckkkkkkkkkkk yeahhhhh!!!!! Bitcoin" is the new "To The Moon!"
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:43:41
This is very true but there is a difference between paying close attention to the price and paying close attention to the development of the network and increasing ease of use. If it's about the technology then price is irrelevant in comparison to other innovations happening.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:57:58
I heard yes....
@_date: 2014-06-10 19:45:32
Murs is the best, has been for 10+ years and I hope they make a video as fun as Risky Business was for this
@_date: 2014-05-05 07:01:49
What could be even cooler is including a QR code in addition to the bitcoin "logo" so fans could send tips while watching from home.
I never post on but I hope someone posts this there so a fighter can see it and contact us, it's a good easy way to get money for a fighter as long as UFC approves it.
@_date: 2014-05-05 08:38:49
Doge sponsored a sport where 65 people have died in car crashes, it's 2014 and UFC have an $80 million dollar TV deal with Fox. If this was 1996 I would agree with you but it's mostly accepted now.
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:14:43
I haven't got into tipping until recently either, it's pretty fun!
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:03:09
Always would love some!!
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:11:57
Same here, HR departments have no idea what they are doing and think that the piece of paper means that the person is smart and hard-working which is never the case.
Glad others have the same opinion, I wish corporate America would widen up.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:25:34
I wish Steam would finally decide to accept this, why is the gaming industry so slow on these things? People are saying TAKE MY MONEY!
@_date: 2014-09-07 20:36:54
Hey this is Tony S. from BitPay. Thanks for bringing this to our attention, I am forwarding it to the support team. Please also make a [support ticket request]( as well
@_date: 2014-05-05 09:12:10
Nike is a big difference from a crowdfunded grassroots campaign. We just need a high enough profile fighter to be interested and then we can work out the rest. Getting Joe Rogan's help could also clear hurdles if we can get his attention, which even if we don't would cause plenty of positive talk.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:00:04
No it's gone and I have no idea why.....
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:38:27
Can't speak on who it is, but notice I said performer and not wrestler....
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:29:50
More people need to request that they accept bitcoin first, believe me paying with bitcoin on Steam would be AMAZING
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:53:19
Crowdsource? I bet we could raise it if we find a fighter interested....
@_date: 2014-05-05 08:52:54
You would be surprised at how good press and a vocal audience would cause a company to bend the rules for something if they find it beneficial. If Joe Rogan sees this thread it could be a huge help in getting this to happen.
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:21:29
Please feel free to ask questions :-) We want to make sure CFB gets that this is a big deal.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:29:56
BitPay actually has 35,000 merchants not 20,000....
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:17:11
It's by far the best wallet out there and I have converted many to use it.
I have used other mobile ones and nothing comes close, I wish the bitcoin community would wake up to this.
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:37:56
Yes it's Bo Dallas, I also made a  one for Bad News Barrett!
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:45:08
Partially because there isn't many times someone can scoop up 30,000 BTC in one transaction
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:44:09
If I could pay with bitcoin in Atlanta I would use Uber exclusively.
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:34:56
How is everyone so positive it's not Banksy? Please school me because I don't know where to look to authenticate this.
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:39:49
I did!
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:36:50
Yes, but they also have sponsorships on their trunks and on those signs they use behind the fighters while they are being introduced.
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:00:19
Don't forget Pheeva for iOS users! Love their app and I'm surprised it isn't mentioned more as it doesn't require a jailbreak, just need to go to pheeva.com on Safari!
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:19:07
I'm fairly certain bitcoin helped, talent is the primary reason but bitcoin is definitely a supplemental reason.
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:01:03
Because they are, the lack of support I have seen for the Pheeva project is depressing when they have created the best wallet possible to use.
@_date: 2014-08-26 15:14:08
This idea sounds fantastic! If you need payment processing BitPay can definitely help :-)
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:10:44
This made me laugh out loud, I couldn't upvote it higher!
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:51:37
Why do you call it recharge?
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:48:32
I'm still trying to get  trending on Twitter, please contact fighters and help so one will get on here.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:45:16
Make sure you post a negative yelp review.
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:33:59
Glad to see this take off so much, and shocked more artists aren't using bitcoin. It's punk as fuck.
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:49:11
Was this from Andiamos? That is a place in Detroit I used to go to when I lived there and they have pretty great food. I wish the restaurant in Detroit accepted BTC too.
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:35:25
Hey Tony S from BitPay here.
When talking to skeptical merchants or media I always recommend the video on [weusecoins.com]( as it's short and explains a lot.
If it turns out he's interested in more, we created [this short video]( to explain our options to reduce the volatility risk for the merchant, the 0% processing fees and a bunch more info in about 90 seconds.
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:44:05
I don't disagree with what you say, but I think that the smartest bankers have realized that this is a great opportunity for their business and are trying to find ways to capitalize on that.
Also it's important to remember the bitcoin generation gap which definitely exists. The people in control of our financial system did not grow up in a world where bitcoin makes any sense at all so they laugh at it...until it threatens their business model.
Look at the music industry for the past 20 years, it's the best case study for ignoring consumer attitude changes continually until it's too late.

Millions of dollars in venture capital funding and big announcements. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:16:27
This site is insane, thanks for ensuring I get zero sleep
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:18:23
When hundreds of millions of dollars go into an industry, the followers come! I for one welcome our new members and hope they spread the word.
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:02:21
And he hasn't been very cool about this at all.
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:32:13
Well if you go to the respective sites you can see mentions of every other wallet but not Pheeva 
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:36:54
If your meetup needs any press from BitPay please let me know, we want to help get the word out!
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:13:43
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-07 05:07:56
I'm sure it is region locked but there are probably ways to get around that. I do agree it's very annoying though, it's like they are stealing business from themselves? This was a major issue when I was import gaming in the late 90s and early 00s and it still hasn't changed much.
The Ouya is a step in the right direction, but it needs software bad.
@_date: 2014-09-05 21:45:42
I would list your title as something like Cryptocurrency Manager and list mining as one of your responsibilities and also add things like wallet generation, the type of storage you use as staffing companies love to pick up words like manager so it would help greatly.
Before I worked for a Bitcoin company I actually did a lot of work at a college helping people find jobs so I learned a lot of little tricks like this.
@_date: 2014-05-06 18:10:16
UFC is global and has immense followings in markets that could be very hospitable to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:19:12
As I created the other post I'm definitely in.
@_date: 2014-05-06 14:19:00
Well it's huge globally which NASCAR isn't so there is that. Doesn't have the same US audience but does hit audiences that NASCAR never sees.
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:04:47
We here at BitPay would love to make this happen...if anyone has a great contact please let me know. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 18:54:30
One of my favorite rap groups ever. I wish I could buy their stuff with bitcoin for real.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:39:52
I don't agree with everything you stand for, but I sure as hell respect that you care enough to know where to go to ask this question and that you asked it in the first place. We need more of this from the entire Senate.
