If the "interested" media outlets publish his dirt, will they credit him as two bit idiot?

Oh lord, AOL keywords. I guess they were for people who grew up with little orphan annie society codes?

Guys, this is actually news.

Naturally we're talking grains of sand compared to Mastercard or Visa's budget, but I have to say that calling bitcoiners stingy seems like a reach. Per capita bitcoiners and altcoiners donate a respectable chunk to things they care about.

I agree, and it's encouraging that the protocol itself is sturdy and appealing enough for even financial experts to overlook the chaos and immaturity of the market (and often the community around it, let's be honest)
This technology was designed for us, we hold most of the cards, and unless we actually want it to remain a niche curiosity... we gotta engage with The Big Boys. We're at an advantage, and could bring this thing onto the world stage in a long term way. But we could also blow it by acting exactly how they accuse us of acting

You guys made me look it up. 
* A millibit (mBTC) is 0.001 BTC, or one thousandth of 1 BTC. 
* A microbit (μBTC) is 0.000001, or one millionth of 1 BTC. 
Like tacklethetree said, $0.02 equals around 0.0000236 BTC, which is 23.6 μBTC

Thanks... I think?

Chinese internet is a mysterious world. I can only guess that when conversations about things that (we bitcoin investors reckon) are "controversial" are allowed uninhibited in a high-profile way, well that's probably SOMEHOW significant. Assuming the hao123 page provides unbiased bitcoin news?
Anyway, thanks for the links! And the inevitable three hours of wikipedia bingeing that follows

That does seem like a problem: the people/organizations who already have the most capital (in any accepted currency) will no doubt have the ability to jump into any game and corner it. And even if someone doesn't do it from the outside, the extremely prosperous early adopters will be equally likely to end up doing the same thing, whether out of greed or economic inevitability.

The more I learn about it, the more I get suspicious that bitcoin planned for the inevitability of inflation, but is left open to a lot of the hazards of deflation. I'm sure people have discussed this, but I really haven't heard any of the explanations for how bitcoin plans to handle the deflation hot potato

Potentially... significant?
Major sale to... investors?
Hmm... speculation!

Of course! That's why gold has value. Weight per ounce!

That's right, he said he's bought things with btc, but has never sold them for dollars.

And a lot of folks don't know a gram of gold is 1/31.1th of an ounce, rather than 1/28th. But even if you are educated on the value of your currency or commodity, it helps actual real-time buying and selling if you measure in a user-friendly unit size. Old gold-backed US dollars were worth 1.67 grams of gold, but people didn't have to remember the spot price of gold and calculate how many 1.67 gram-sized units they needed when they used their dollars to go buy a horse, because the unit had been calibrated for the purpose of easy exchange.
