Currency is supposed to be stable, not deflationary or inflationary. But there will be deflationary assets such as Bitshares which will likely overtake Bitcoin precisely for the same reason that Bitcoin overtakes the US dollar.
Deflation is a feature which promotes long term store of value while inflation promotes short term spending.

Only he doesn't know. He thinks of Bitcoin as a product instead of as a protocol. You can ban a product, you cannot ban a protocol. No protocol has ever been banned. Anonymous remailers have never been banned and neither has file sharing protocols like Bittorrent and these did not have the sort of legitimate uses and life changing properties.
Bitcoin is a life changing technology similar to the Internet. People are willing to go to prison over it. Trying to stop Bitcoin would be like trying to ban the Internet in 1995.
Yes they could have tried to ban it in 1995 and it would have failed. Not only would it have failed but a lot of people's lives would have been negatively effected and the economy would have taken a hit rather than go through a period of growth.
It's never really a good idea to go against technological trends as an investor or a regulator. Innovation is more important than regulation because without innovation you can't improve regulation. 
Regulators who take the "regulate at any cost" attitude are part of the problem. Sometimes regulation today makes it harder to regulate 10 or 20 years from now.

I don't think you understand. These governments both want control and it has nothing to do with Bitcoin at all really. Bitcoin is insignificant in the military context.

And you're wrong about biometrics in general. Different biometric schemes are easier or harder to compromise. Some schemes have never been compromised and have resisted all attempts. Others are really cheap to compromise with enough effort.
Security is all about the cost and effort an attacker must make to defeat it. No security with humans involved is undefeatable. All you can do is make it as expensive for the attacker as possible.
This $80 device will raise expenses for attacks x1000 so it's a good investment. Trezor is good and I recommend that too but one of the errors the Trezor team made is the fact that they didn't add any biometric capabilities to it and the fact that the coins are actually stored inside the Trezor is a problem too if you don't back it up.
Biometrics are better than pins. A pin can be guessed or you can slip up and leak the pin by accident a lot easier than your ECG. Of course if the attacker has unlimited resources they could probably steal your ECG and simulate it but that's too expensive to do to thousands of people at a time.
So the point is to make it so hackers have to target individuals specifically and make yourself the most expensive and difficult target.
@_date: 2014-02-05 07:53:39
Passwords are worse than biometrics. Anyone can crack a password. Cracking biometrics takes a lot more time and effort and someone would have to specifically target you to do it.
Biometrics combined with cold storage is probably as secure as you can get. Passwords aren't very good for security because most people can't remember them, don't choose very strong passwords, and then you have to find some place to store a backup of the password which defeats the whole point.
Biometrics is about protecting something you have. If you're using a strong password then you're protecting something you know. It's easier to protect something you have than something you know.

The US government isn't a single thing, it's many parts which don't communicate, and it's more decentralized than people realize. 
Counter terrorism investigators don't communicate with the State Dept, CIA or whatever part of the government that funds terrorism overseas. They have completely different missions and while they do share information once in a while it's not like they all have the same mission and same operations.
So the purpose of counter terrorism is to prevent you and I from being attacked by drones from Iranian spies. Without counter terrorism then the same thing that happens overseas would happen to the United States citizens.
You have nutcases who if they could would create biological weapons to exterminate entire races of people. There are actual threats who have to be investigated one way or another. So whether you hate the US government or not doesn't change the fact that someone somewhere should be researching and investigating these possibilities.

You're not going to have critical mass if thieves can get away with stealing millions of Bitcoins. It's a problem in some ways and if it were taken too far it could be a threat to fungability but I don't see the harm in asking people questions during an investigation. If you didn't steal the coins what problem do you have answering the questions?
You got verified just to buy Bitcoins but now you cannot answer where you bought them when you know millions of Bitcoins are stolen and floating around? They should give you your Bitcoins but they do have a right to ask and if you try to cash out to FIAT then they have legal authority to confiscate.

It's not "infinitely" easier. It's not even easy. How many people know enough about technology to effectively outsmart the FBI, the NSA, all foreign intelligence and effectively launder money?
It's easy to launder cash. It's hard to do anything on the Internet without leaving a trace. If you download the client you leave a trace. If you purchase a coin from someone you can't trust they could tell the government. If you mine your own coins then it might show up in analysis of your electricity usage. 
There is no way to hide what you're doing from the government when it's electronic. There is no way to hide from the government when it involves putting it on the Internet. When it's not using the Internet then all the technological advantages of the US government cannot be put to use.
Cash isn't on the internet. There is no easy way to track all the cash on earth. You can track every Bitcoin on earth on the blockchain and even when people try to hide it will leave evidence that they are hiding and allow the government to get a warrant to look closer.

In about a year Bitcoin will be a 1 trillion dollar economy and will definitely be a big deal.
But it will also create a lot of jobs for a lot of people. So they want to destroy the economy because they worry about a few criminals? And when I say a few criminals it's literally just a few. The majority of Bitcoin users are trying to get rich, trying to make a living, or are just computer nerds who find the technology fascinating. 
The criminals? Very few have been violent. Most of the time it's scams, theft, fraud, money laundering or drugs. So these sorts of crimes don't even scare most of America enough to ban Bitcoin or even to talk about Bitcoin as if it's something which is dangerous.
When Bitcoin is used in a terrorist attack or by organized crime that is when we will have a change of opinion. That could happen sometime down the road when you have tens of millions of hundreds of millions using it because it's just a matter of statistics but just like terrorists use Facebook and we don't ban Facebook or terrorists use twitter and we don't ban twitter, why bully Bitcoin?

Since we are civilians, we don't benefit from terrorism. Some government somewhere probably would benefit from it, but you and I do not.

The context was World War 2. That situation isn't anything like what is going on now. Bitcoin isn't going to be the currency used in a World War.
In a World War there will be cryptocurrencies designed to be completely stealth while Bitcoin is designed to be transparent. You can see every Bitcoin transaction on the ledger and that is a good thing. In a war there wouldn't be any way to trace a transaction and we might not even be able to see it because it would be totally dark.
Gold and cash were far more anonymous than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the benefit of being an international currency which can transmit value at the speed of the Internet. I can't send gold packets unless I send Bitcoins.

Assume for a moment that every government in the world abuses human rights, wouldn't you think an anonymous cryptocurrency would make it much easier for them to do it?
So I'm not disputing the fact that governments sponsor terrorism, or that governments abuse human rights. I'm making the case that governments are not monolithic. You can have agencies within a government which investigate other agencies within the same government. You can have moles and terrorists within a government. You can have corruption within a government.
Anonymous cryptocurrency can empower the forces in and outside of government who do not respect human rights. It can empower terrorist groups and allow governments to sponsor those groups.
Why shouldn't these possibilities be investigated and studied by the agencies which exist to investigate these things? Do you think if these agencies stay ignorant that somehow the bad guys will not be investigating it? Do you think it's enough to have civilians investigating it if it's not investigated by counter terrorism or counter intelligence as well?
Increasing the funding for terrorism will only create more victims such as yourself. It will only make the problem much worse if no one in any other agency understands how Bitcoin works except for the agencies which want to use it to fund terrorism.

It's not inferior. And it's not security by obscurity either. Biometrics will allow it to only open if its you. That requires you to open it. That is not absolute security but it's probably the best you're going to get because a password doesn't even require you to do it.
Someone can crack your password over the Internet. You can't crack your biometrics over the Internet. That person would have to burglarize your home and rob you at gun point.
So if you have so much in Bitcoin that you're worried about physical danger you shouldn't keep it in your house to begin with. Cold storage shouldn't mean putting it all in the same location.

As technology becomes more sophisticated then genocide, torture, and other inhumane activities become easier. Terrorist groups will gain more power and that isn't something I want to see happen.

It's not always easy or cheap to compromise it. What you do is you make it so expensive to compromise that no one will invest the effort.
If it costs more to compromise than the worth of the Bitcoins it protects then it's not going to be targeted but if you have 10 million dollars in a wallet then they don't have to compromise the wallet they will just compromise you and make you empty the wallet whether you have a password, wear a biometric or not.

This false flag threat might be true. I actually think that could happen. This is why we should take terrorism more seriously and try to do what we can to prevent it because certain countries don't like Bitcoin and might take drastic measures if it does become too popular or the price gets too high.
Additionally, what makes you think Bitcoin even matters? I'm sure they'd develop their own cryptocurrencies which work much better, truly anonymous, and use those.
I don't think they would use cash USD because cash isn't as untraceable as people think. There are some dangers to having digital currencies and everyone has to be aware of that.

But FDR could physically confiscate gold. This isn't anything like that. This is like banning cursing on the Internet. You can ban it on TV because you have enough control over who can transmit. You don't control what people say on the Internet.
Since you can't control what people can say you cannot stop a Bitcoin transaction. All you would do is make people hide it and make the problem much worse. It's better to have people using Bitcoins out in the open than to be using it in a way which is almost impossible to monitor. 
At this point in time the FBI and NSA can see every transaction and knows who is buying Bitcoins. They can look at your bank account and know you purchased and when you cash out.
If they crack down they lose all that information. They wont know who is doing what anymore but the protocol will still exist and will primarily be exploited by organized criminals and terrorists.

Exactly, but the idea that people aren't moving Bitcoins around is not true. Look at the amount of transactions, most of the Bitcoins are moving.
I suppose Satoshi isn't spending his but that is not the majority. Also people never spend all their stash this soon when there is no investments to make yet. When the ability to buy hard assets increases you'll see it get spent.
I guarantee you if a Bitcoin is worth $10,000 people will be buying cars, paying off college loans, buying boats, going on vacations, but they'll also be buying property and starting businesses. Those businesses will probably accept dollars and Bitcoins too and boost the economy.

A decentralized fiat-crypto exchange could work but the fiat portion would have to be centralized. If you were to buy Mastercoins through Coinbase for example that would be with a verified account. If you buy Mastercoins in person or on something like Localmastercoins then you'd be able to buy it directly from other people if you wire them the cash.
It's a problem and I don't know how it can be done decentralized but Bitcoin isn't decentralized in that area either. Perhaps one way to do it would be to adapt the Bitcoin ATM machines into Mastercoin ATM machines and then sell Mastercoins to those Mastercoin ATM machines in a decentralized manner.
Then when people want to exchange cash for Mastercoins they could go to their ATM. Who wants to make the first Mastercoin ATM? Right now there isn't enough demand for Mastercoins to bother but the moment there is demand then the Bitcoin ATM can easily be adapted to support Mastercoin.

All you think about is the price. The value of cryptocurrencies is based on the utility, not just the buying power. The buying power of all cryptocurrencies will go up but there wont be any technological innovation without competition.
The value of Bitcoin wont go up as quickly? So what? It will ultimately go up much higher long term if there are alternatives out there than if it were the only coin. The more people get rich from Litecoin and whatever comes after it, the more demand will build for cryptocurrencies in general including Bitcoin. You think people who get rich from Litecoin wont support Bitcoin or use Bitcoins? They'll be trading in Bitcoins too and will be using Bitcoins too which means a larger market cap for Bitcoin too.

"Due to the limited monetary units of Bitcoin"
Bitcoins can be broken down into many parts. There is no effective monetary limit, it's an illusion. What that means is while the largest denomination is limited to 21 million the actual amount of satoshi per individual is practically unlimited.
Unlike fiat currencies which are physical and which cannot be broken down into fractions of a penny and 1 millionths of a penny, Bitcoin can be broken down to smaller and smaller levels into infinite. This means there will be no reason to ever inflate the currency, and the fear that there wont be enough for everyone is also a myth.
There will be hundreds of thousands of satoshi for everyone right now and potentially millions of satoshi for everyone in the future. There wont be enough so that everyone can own a whole Bitcoin but not everyone is a billionaire now and we don't talk about them being hoarders do we?
I do think a whole Bitcoin will be worth $5000-1000 within 10 years but people will always have enough to do what they need to do because everything will be priced in satoshis.

Instead of going to mBTC and all that crap just ask them how much money they would like to spend to buy Bitcoin, they enter in an amount and the Bitcoin amount appears in their wallet. There is no reason to even tell people about mBTC or whatever. Just let people buy $1 worth if that is what they have and give it to them without them having to keep track of what that is.

Mining will always be profitable though because difficulty is rising not because mining isnt profitable but because it's becoming more efficient. As it becomes more energy efficient the cost of mining will decrease and profitability goes up but at the same time difficulty does go up as well.

Cash never was anonymous. It's a myth. If cash is anonymous why don't we just give anonymous cash to politicians overseas to get them to do what we want them to do?

Something to consider long term, while dividends may go up and down in cycles the demand for ASICminer shares will not. We are at 2.8 BTC a share which means we are really really early adopters. Over the course of 5 years each of these shares could be worth 50 BTC or even 100BTC.
The reason this could happen is because miners will reinvest mining revenue into purchasing these shares making these shares the most valuable crypto commodity. People will say ASICMINER-PT shares will reach a cost that only few can afford? Then the majority will be buying TAT.ASICMINER instead but demand will essentially go up forever because there is nothing to stop it from going up forever along with hash rate.
Getting in when it was under 3 BTC a share is equal to having bought Bitcoins when they were $3 a Bitcoin. People lucky enough to get ASICminer-PT shares for under a Bitcoin are potentially going to become millionaires if they play their cards right. If it were a lottery the winners are anyone who bought less than 1 BTC, if they have enough shares of course. Anyone with 100 shares or more will be a millionaire almost for certain, and anyone with 10 shares or more will be making thousands of dollars a week someday. Anyone with thousands of shares will probably be a billionaire someday.
All you can do is get as many shares as you can because there are only 400,000 going around which means it's going to grow up exponentially just like Bitcoin. Someone did their math.

You're absolutely correct on all 3. Scalability will be fixed with off-chain transactions. The price per unit can be fixed if we go to the coinbase route and just price it in USD entirely and let them enter in how much USD they would like to spend and then give them that amount in Bitcoin. If you don't ask them how much Bitcoin they want to buy then you remove the problem. 
The third problem is the most difficult to solve. You cannot solve the third problem except by web wallet and eventually a Bitcoin Credit Union.

If you are a student my advice to you is take out a college loan and invest around $3000 into Bitcoin. If it is a success you'll have a retirement fund for the rest of your life and if it fails you tried your best which is more than you can say for most.
You have already taken the risk by taking out loans to go to college. Why not take another risk?

I think you're wrong. Let's say Bitcoin ends up being $5000 in the future, that would mean even people getting in right now could be people with tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars 10 years from now.
This is still the early adopter phase. $100 is nothing. Bitcoins could be going for $5000, $10,000 or $20,000. Right now less than 5 million people are using Bitcoins so it's only a billion dollar market cap. It will be a trillion dollar market cap within 5 years which will make $5000 easily possible.

Discuss the potentials of new forms of governance such as virtual governance to provide self regulation for the Internet community.
It does not have to be the wild west. There is a community, and there will be a democracy or democracies. Important to note is that the virtual community and traditional nation states should be able to work together provided that the Internet is treated as something not owned by anyone. 
This means Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies cannot be owned by anyone and are sovereign private virtual currencies. It would mean virtual states can be sovereign entities. If there is to be regulation it should come from the Internet community and not people who do not understand the new forms of governance. It should not be hard for the representatives of US/EU or any other to join the virtual community and participate on the virtual level so that their interests can be represented.

Not every liberal/social justice type has a high IQ, is well informed, is well read, is open minded. The other problem is a lot of liberal/social justice types aren't technologically savvy. 
But if they are, they'll come around to using Bitcoins. Also there is left-libertarianism so the libertarians are oppressive meme doesn't even fit all libertarians. Left-libertarians like Noam Chomsky are their allies but many liberal types are too stupid to realize that and think of all libertarians are being the right wing Rand Paul type.
To understand what libertarianism is about they would have to read the actual philosophy. The philosophy is more connected to the left than the right, and is more associated with anarchists and even with socialists.
The point here is that Bitcoin isn't a left-right thing any more than the Internet, Email, or Instant Message is left or right wing. The technology is designed to free all people depending on how you choose to use it, and the fact that social justice types would rather rely on someone else to produce social justice than to directly create it for themselves is the reason why their activities aren't effective.
The best line of attack/debate is to show them in ineffective their strategy and tactics have been. If they still think the best form of social justice can come from making the government print money to pay for everything then let them try getting the government to do that and eventually when they discover they aren't able to make the government do it because they don't control the government they'll understand why Bitcoin is important.

Let's be realistic, we want to have these sorts of discussions. But we should be having these discussions in public, with input from the community. Bitcoin community should start hosting it's own conference to discuss issues such as how to curb violent abuse of the technology, how to make sure the technology protects the most defenseless in society, I think 99% of the community agrees with these principles.
But what the community does not want are victimless crimes. Victimless criminals are political prisoners. Victimless criminals are victims of the law itself. If you look at Silk Road you will notice that services such as assassinations and the like are not supported. These sorts of services don't receive popular support even amongst the underground part of the community. Child abuse also is not popular, and neither is violence in general.
So the area where both communities (law enforcement) and libertarians Bitcoiners can come together is in protecting the community from violence. The way the current law enforcement establishment wants to do things goes against the wishes of the community they are assigned to protect. I agree that law enforcement has to go after the producers, and I think in order to do this the community is going to have to self police so that it's not socially acceptable to create and distribute child porn. If it's going to happen then it will have to be in the darkest part of the darknet.
But what isn't wanted is dragnet surveillance, undercover sting operations to bother drug users or drug dealers, arresting escorts, this sort of activity by law enforcement is entirely political and extremely unpopular because the community knows it's political. It's political because the outcomes from these arrests aren't actually achieving any end beyond making one group of people feel emotionally content at the expense of another group of people.

Saving is necessary for investing. Investing is good but you can't invest if you don't save first. So hoarding is just another word for saving.
It would be a problem if new Bitcoins weren't being generated every day but it's not that situation and probably never will be.

Bitcoin is high risk high reward. If you're already well off and have more to lose than to gain then perhaps you should not take the risk. If you're struggling and have more to gain than to lose then why not take the risk?
The government probably wont ban Bitcoins but even if it does it wont happen overnight and it wont be banned everywhere. It could take more than 5 years before that happens in the USA if it happens at all and by then Bitcoins could be worth thousands.  High fees and regulation is the likely course of action because the US government would benefit from taxing it rather than banning it. If its worth thousands that means you have new tax payers to help pay down the deficit or pay for the government so I don't think government will mind.
The Internet was not banned and it was just as disruptive as Bitcoin. The government did not rush to tax the Internet. It took years before the Internet faced any regulation, and taxes are just now coming after almost 20 years later.

It's real. Just do the math for $1000 per Bitcoin with the amount of shares you currently have and consider that 1 share could be worth 100 Bitcoins a year from now or close to it. $100,000 a share is reasonable for the PT, and for TAT it's going to rise too but I think they will appeal to different kinds of investors.
Imagine Bitcoin goes mainstream like people predict it will and ASICminer maintains around 20% of the mining profit as many think they will, then imagine Bitcoin price goes up to $1000 like many people say it will, and that the shares go up along with it. Where will the institutional investment money go? Probably to buy these shares because the dividends and ROI will be so high annually that any investmnet fund which starts will probably buy these shares in bulk.
The problem is no one is going to sell these shares for cheap. So the big investment funds can afford to spend $100,000 a share, that is nothing for them. But for you, if you have 50 shares worth $100,000 each then you're a millionaire. Even if none of this happens, you'll still be getting plenty in dividends.

That is because no one really knows a precise number just like no one really knows a precise price for BTC. We know BTC is worth between $100-150 at this time. We know it could reasonably be worth up to $1000 in 2014. That is about all we know, some say it could be worth $10,000-100,000 but these estimates are less reasonable because the Bitcoin network and source code isn't ready for that kind of growth yet.
But with ASICminer shares you have something different. There is no Max Block Size issue, no DDOS, no way to suppress demand once it takes off and it eventually will. If even a small percentage of miners start putting their profits into buying these shares the price will get to over 10BTC a share and I believe that will happen in a matter of weeks to months.
Any estimates over 10 BTC a share would depend on too many variables so 10 BTC a share is a conservative estimate which most people would consider reasonable. 100 BTC a share isn't reasonable in 2013, but in 2014 it might become reasonable because nothing stops a corporation from forming to buy these shares as part of a long term investment fund and setting up a Bitcoin retirement fund based on these shares. The institutional investment money could easily push these shares to over 100 BTC a share. 
But all that depends on the performance of ASICminer.

Side channel attacks like differential power analysis can get the private key off smart cards. There is no perfect security except to use cold storage and even that is not perfect.
But for something like identities you need something secure as hell but not something which is in cold storage. When I communicate with someone I want to know without a doubt I'm communicating with them, not someone who has their private key pretending to be them. Finger vein recognition in my opinion is both easy and would make it nearly 100% certain to be them.
The only other way to have that certainty is for them to go on camera or talk on the phone or both. But that removes the pseudo-anonymous nature of it all which is why biometrics provide a way to have a secure consistent authentication method.
If you just use encryption without an authentication method how do I know who is really behind the computer? All I ask is that the developers add in the capability for us to develop biometric systems and create an industry to supply to the demand. The demand for biometrics will be there whether you think so or not and it's better we do this than let the federal government try to push some kind of federal ID smart card which none of us want.
At least if we do it then we can maintain privacy and pseudo-anonymity, keep it all open source, try to develop a form of biometric security which works well, and yes some forms are not easy to counterfeit. No one has successfully fooled finger vein recognition and for grandma who cannot remember long passwords and can't find her security token she will know where her finger is.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:56:30
This reaction is exactly what we don't need. Divide and conquer benefits only federal entities who want to divide the Bitcoin community up.
The strategy should be to put better regulators in place and to change the legal regulations so that better regulations can be followed. You cannot avoid all regulation because that is not possible in the modern world but there is no reason to erode privacy due to regulations. Regulations need to be changed so that privacy is important. 
That means Bitcoiners will have to become regulators and get involved in politics. Both sides presented in the news are extreme where on one hand you want to validate every coin and track every transaction so that there is no privacy or on the other hand you want absolute anonymity for everyone. Neither of these approaches can work realistically.
If law enforcement has a warrant they should be able to uncover the identity and if not then they shouldn't. They did not have to do it like this. Nothing stops the US government from relying on it's global network of government allies to provide them with information or tips when investigating crime. 
You do not need surveillance to investigate crime. If it were really bad they could go to the owner of the exchange and work with them on a case by case basis. There is a need for providing tools and software to allow for information sharing but to call it coinvalidation and to do it in the wrong way is worse than doing nothing at all.
When I give Bitcoin to pay for my porn I do not expect it to be traced to my identity unless there is a warrant for a serious crime I committed. If I'm gay and it's a crime in my part of town I don't expect to be persecuted by law enforcement using this technology.

They are full of shit. Yes sex trafficking is a problem and there are a lot of very violent cruel activities which go on in these unregulated markets, but that is not the vast majority of the activities and really saying it cannot be investigated at all is false.
The number of child sex or adult sex traffickers and individuals involved in the white slavery industry is low. This problem is similar to the problem with terrorism where theres a very small amount of actors doing a very large amount of damage to society. The solution is not to hinder technological progress or to put everyone under surveillance. The answer is to put only suspects under surveillance and if there are drones, wiretaps, the NSA, and all that, then if human lives are at stake or if it's a crime against the defenseless whether they are children or elderly then I'm sure the same way this anonymity can facilitate it, the same mechanisms can be leveraged to investigate it.
Community policing can benefit greatly from it and if there were human trafficking or child exploitation going on then it could be reported anonymously by the community to investigators. It also means that if investigators are corrupt that can be reported by the community to the media.

You did not look at the kind of biometric technology I presented. I'm not talking about fingerprint, I'm talking about finger vein. It only works if the user is alive, and blood must be flowing or it does not work so if you remove a finger it will not fool it.

And something you are = biometrics. I say use all three.
Not every bioidentifier can be duplicated is the point easily or cheaply. No known method is available for finger vein recognition. You chop the finger off and the blood is gone and no veins. The person basically has to be alive and have his or her finger in the device.
No one has found a way to duplicate finger vein recognition. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's probably very expensive and no hacker targeting the masses is going to be able to afford to do it. Most importantly it's simple 
Nothing to remember, nothing which can be lost.
To get someones finger print is cheap to copy. To get someones password is even cheaper. To get someones token is cheap as well, but finger vein recognition costs more than all of them combined at this point and that is what makes it more secure for certain things.
Honestly the point is to make it as expensive as possible for mallory. It will never be impossible if mallory is willing to spend unlimited resources.

And what is to secure that wallet? A password wont be good enough anymore. A yubikey wont be good enough anymore even with a OTP.
You lose the Yubikey and you lose your identity and everything you own.
You lose your password and you lose your identity and everything you own.
You can't lose what you are, so it is time to move onto biometric security for something like this. It's not in the category of toy or experiment anymore.
Something like this could allow a hacker, identity thief or burglar to completely destroy a person if it is not properly secured using the state of the art. Yubikey wont be good enough.
When you talk into a bank the bankers can see your face and identify you by your physical features which cannot easily be faked. When we are talking about this anonymous or pseudo-anonymous online communication then there is no way to know who you're communicating with,  so what I would want is a way to know that if 
I'm Bob that my biology is my digital signature and it cannot be duplicated, and that Alice is biologically on the other end and that her biology cannot be duplicated.
There are many different kinds of biometrics and we probably need to move in that direction starting right now. It's not a lot of money right now in Bitcoin land so criminals aren't focused on it, but if Bitshares really is going to become a distributed finance project then eventually there could be billions or trillions of dollars in that system and the level of security as it is in 2013 is comical to any serious cyber criminal.
A password even with a Yubikey is not going to protect you from a highly motivated and organized Mallory. If you use the wrong technology you merely move the attack vector rather than reducing the risk of attack. This isn't sharing music, the RIAA wont be coming for you, it will be sophisticated cybercriminals. The single greatest threat would be if people start somehow losing their money.

It's not an easy problem to solve but it is possible. Finger vein recognition is not possible to counterfeit for example.
Would you trust your life savings with a security token that anyone can take from you and empty your bank account with it? I wouldn't.
The free market should offer choices. Some people would prefer biometric identification such as finger vein recognition in addition to a security token. Some people just want a security token, some people don't mind passwords and some people think passwords should be phased out.
I think passwords should be phased out. Biometrics with a security token are better than just a security token. I wont be putting my life savings into any password or token. Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies are like cash, irreversible transactions. 
It's not like when someone steals your car and you have insurance and it's not like where if someone steals money from your bank account or robs the bank where you can get your life savings back. At this point in time I would not trust my life savings to this system because I don't think private key security is sufficient.
The way around it is to use cold storage or resort to having to cash out into a bank. If you have to use a bank then how exactly is this replacing the functions of the banking system? Let's be honest here, it's a lot harder to hack into the bank than it will be to hack into the masses and I just don't see anyone except hackers having the knowledge to secure their private key and feeling safe with their life savings being stored on some private key.
PGP has been around for a while and there is a reason no one uses it. It's incredibly difficult to use properly. You have to be careful how you generate the private key, what computer you generate it on does matter, whether the random number generator works properly is critical, and most people aren't going to memorize long random passwords or remember where their security token is. 
So if they forget their password or lose their token then what? If they lose their cellphone then what happens?

Bitcoin in my opinion will grow more powerful as more smart people can't find work, as more college graduates can't find a job.

I think any community has a responsibility to police itself. If the community does not police itself then outsiders who don't understand or care about the community may take on that role instead. Bitcoin should police itself as much as possible and avoid giving outside authorities an excuse to try and come in and tell everyone what they can and can't do.
This means either the Bitcoin community will need some back channel to law enforcement so that if there is an act of terrorism or child exploitation going on that the community can work with law enforcement to combat it, or the community should do everything it can to make these activities uncool and not socially acceptable.
The fact is there will be instances where an investigation has to take place and where the majority of the community agrees that something has to be done. It might not be child porn, or terrorism, but it might be a hacker who stole millions or billions of dollars in coins and in that instance the community will want to work with law enforcement. To take on the attitude that there is never an instance where the community will have to help an investigation is just plain wrong, the community will have to develop the capacity to investigate and help with investigations sooner or later.

If a user of a cryptocurrency is a virtual citizen of a virtual sovereign state such as Wirtland then it would be up to Wirtland to tax it's virtual citizens. Nation states have no right or authority to tax virtual currencies. Virtual sovereignty should be as respected as traditional sovereignty. If a virtual citizen chooses to pay taxes to one virtual state or another then that is just fine.
But nation states should not have the right to tax virtual currencies. If the users of virtual currencies cash out into the nation state currencies then the nation state has the right to tax their own currency, but just as the US cannot tax a European using the Euro in Europe, the EU shouldn't be able to tax a Bitcoin user in a virtual community.
The virtual community exists in our minds, it has no land which has to be protected by the government. It exists as 1s and 0s and for this reason the government does not have any authority to interfere with the freedom of association and free speech of individuals. The exception can be made for violence and for fraud because these problems cannot be solved yet by the virtual community but when fraud can be solved, or if the community has some mechanism of insurance against it, then the nation state will only have to focus protecting us from violence and from being hacked.

Under inflation no one has any buying power and everyone is in debt. What money?
If inflation gave us all life savings then why aren't we all investors already?
Deflation encourages saving and you can only invest if you save. How do you invest when you never have any savings? Inflation means credit, not higher salaries. Credit means debt, which means a lower standard of living, less savings, and less money for investment.
Imagine for a moment that some people do save their Bitcoins and become millionaires, are you telling me they wont diversify and buy stock or buy property, a boat, or anything? People who become millionaires typically have to put their money somewhere else to diversify and spread risk.
For that reason even the savers in Bitcoin will eventually be investors in the stock market, or own companies, or real estate. To think a person would rather just exclusively own coins worth millions of dollars when they can own real estate, stocks, even US Treasury Bonds if they like, then you're not thinking very big. 
Right now the reason people aren't spending their Bitcoins is because the  regulation environment isn't allowing people to buy stocks with Bitcoins, or real estate. When it becomes easy to buy stock, people wont settle for a few million in Bitcoin when they can become billionaires. For that reason people will continue to spend in the form of investment. It's already happening in fact.
Also don't forget donations, people will donate too. Give it time for Bitcoin infrastructure to be built.
@_date: 2013-08-21 22:44:46
It's the opposite. A deflationary currency encourages investment. Inflationary currency does not. If the currency is inflationary you are encouraged to put it into some store of value or another currency which is less inflationary.
If it's deflationary then if you invest it wisely then you're not just a little bit better off in the future but you could be filthy rich. If you already are filthy rich then if you want to get richer you can buy corporations, stocks, etc.

Encryption is fine but what about access control? What if I want some people to be able to access the information but not others and I want to list exactly that group of people by their biometric and digital signature?
Biometric authentication is necessary because Alice does not know whether or not she is talking to Bob or Mallory unless something biological proves it is Bob. Man in the Middle attacks are very easy, just steal someones laptop or wait for them to not attend to it and then you can read everything? Unacceptable.
If this technology relies on a password and username I recommend anyone interested in privacy not to use this technology until it offers true multi-factor authentication. That means something you are, something you have or own, and something you know. This could be as simple as a fingerprint, a yubikey, and a pin number. Any system which deals with identities which interface with money in any form should at least have this built in.
This is constructive criticism, please take it into account developers.

It doesn't have to reach even 1% of the global economy for the price to hit 100k. 100k is actually a low figure. If Bitcoin is mainstream then it's more like 300k and if you're talking about 50% adoption that's probably almost a million or perhaps over a million. I don't think 50% adoption is going to happen. 
I do see pension funds and institutional investors. I do see it replacing Paypal and credit cards for online purchases. For online purchases nothing is really better than Bitcoin. For offline purchases I do see Bitcoin taking the place of cash for people who don't want to carry cash. All it would take is a Bitcoin debit card and a Bitcoin ATM and Bitcoin will go mainstream but not at 50% adoption.

So are smart cards, passwords and security tokens. But we don't say no one should use them even though they are just as insecure.
Finger vein recognition is a secure form of biometric. There are insecure smart cards which are vulnerable to side channels and insecure tokens as well, but we all recommend people use tokens why? Cellphones are extremely insecure, someone steals that and if its not encrypted it's worthless but people use that. Passwords are the most insecure if the password isn't completely random and long but people use that.
It's not that biometrics are more insecure than tokens and passwords, it's in the implementation. Poorly implemented private key security is the standard no matter what you use, but there are secure implementations of biometrics, of tokens, and of passwords. I think biometrics are easiest to get right for people who are not computer experts or who don't want to worry about protecting some dongle, smart card, cellphone, or remembering some long password.

It's not about reporting, but about taint being used for political purposes. And of course if you can comply its better but some laws cannot be complied and then almost every coin can become "tainted".

Maybe I'm making the flaw of assuming they will. I don't assume Bitcoin will be the only cryptocurrency which they could sell their ASIC equipment for or mine. If I were running ASICminer and another coin were competitive with Bitcoin I don't see why I wouldn't mine them both at 20% of each of their network. 
If you have an ASICminer company, yes certainly people will pay 100BTC a share if they could get a nice ROI. The only limit would be the 21 million Bitcoin limit but that limit has nothing to do with ASICminer as a company. If there are no more Bitcoins there will be other coins to mine and pay dividends in and this would make 100 BTC a share begin to make sense.
Any coin which uses Proof of Work and SHA256 will be capable of being mined by ASICminer today. They'll be able to sell equipment for all of them as well, and we have no way to predict how big it could get.

Even if nothing at all happens, Bitcoin will be $10k due to the upcoming block halvings. Every 4 years the reward halves and with the high difficulty and hard cap of 21 million it is a near certainty that it will be worth $10,000 within the next 5-10 years or it will be made illegal prior to reaching that point.
That means all you have to do is hold onto your coins for 5 years.

You're assuming ASICminer will only generate profit from mining Bitcoins? ASICs will mine any altcoin which supports SHA256.

You are correct. A fiat exchange will be critical to the success of Mastercoin because Mastercoin should only be priced in national currencies and not unstable virtual currencies.

How many shares do we have to buy? Each share is 2.5 Bitcoins at least so give us a number. Also the amount of dividends you get is actually something like $3 a share and while that is fine it's not necessarily fantastic or equal to mining with the GPU even.

Would you have thought to get into Bitcoin when it was $20 or so? Asicminer shares are going to be over 10BTC a share in a few months and will pass 5 BTC a share in weeks. Unlike Bitcoin there is nothing to slow it down, no DDOS, no hacks. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 09:23:16
Even if you don't, it's share value is growing so if you put money into it now you'll get x5 or x10 back and that isn't counting dividends but just the ability to sell the shares you purchased at 2.6 for 5 or even 10BTC a share a month from now.

It should be two way. If we don't have transparency what is to stop a government from launching a covert operation using Bitcoin to bribe politicians with money they print up and use to buy Bitcoins to bribe politicians with? 
Don't you guys think about this stuff? Anonymous isn't necessarily better long term. In the short term it might seem good  as a reaction to the overreach of government but it provides an opening for government to gain unlimited power in the future.
A government which gains control of Bitcoin and the anonymous cash system would literally take over the entire world and all politics by simply bribing everyone. If money mysteriously appeared in your Bitcoin wallet when you did something some rich person liked, you'd be much more likely to keep doing that. This would be fine if everyone had a similar amount of money but we have totally ultra rich 1% individuals who don't know what Bitcoin is yet but when they find out nothing stops them from buying the majority of them, or from mining the majority of them.
What about Satoshi Nakamoto? He has a million Bitcoins. So now he can anonymously spend them on what exactly?
There are some issues to work out and transparency vs secrecy is a real philosophical divide. Anonymity does not necessarily make the Bitcoin network more secure, it can help corrupt it as well depending on how its used or abused.

In order for cryptocurrencies to evolve, competition is necessary. It's not just about Bitcoin anymore it's about cryptocurrencies in general.
Also have a closer look at Mincoin, PPcoin, Namecoin, these coins are not exact clones of Litecoin or Bitcoin. Mincoin is unique because it's more scarce than Bitcoin (Litecoin cannot say this), yet it's faster at transactions than Litecoin. PPcoin is the first Proof of Stake coin. Namecoin is an abstract currency based name distribution coin.
Feathercoin, Chinacoin, BBQcoin and some of the others are pump and dump coins. You can identify a pump and dump coin by how scarce it is and how quickly they generate. Feathercoin's only advantage was that it was easy to mine and that theres so many. These coins are designed to help miners make profits so that miners can upgrade equipment.

People have no idea how valuable these shares are. So to put it all into perspective we have people talking about Bitcoin going to $1000, so how much will your dividends be worth then? What about if Bitcoin reaches $10,000, how much then? What about if it reaches $50,000 or $100,000 like some people say Bitcoins could someday reach, how much will the dividends be worth then?
And even if the dividends don't grow the share value will. So how much will the shares be worth when Bitcoins are at $1000 and each share costs 100BTC? Just do the math.

Typical. Someone who was an early investor with thousands of Bitcoins preaching about commerce. The reason there isn't much commerce is because mining isn't profitable anymore (for anyone right now).
When mining isn't profitable the only thing people can do is mine and dump (which is what we see people doing right now).  
When people mine and dump the price has to fall even if difficulty is going up due to Asics (which is what we are seeing now).
The only solution is to wait it out while offering opportunities for people to make long term investments. Commerce doesn't make sense. First you have to turn the big Bitcoin holders with thousands of Bitcoins into investors and keep them from cashing out. Then you make the people with hundreds of Bitcoins into investors. Then you make people with tens of Bitcoins into investors.
When enough people are investing then they'll profit along with the companies they invest in. This allows them to use their dividends as spending money for commerce. This is the only way to have a sound economy where you have savers, investors and plenty of commerce.
The way it is happening right now everyone is relying on VCs. VCs are funding startups with fiats using money from central banks. That money never circulates back into the community so it's a one way spend where anyone who gives to those companies wont get it back as dividends. That cannot work.
So the solution is, if you want more commerce to take place then we need more stakeholders. When everyone who is buying Bitcoins now is buying to invest in companies and become a stakeholder then you'll see money being spent. But if you're expecting people to keep buying Bitcoins just to throw it into a black hole pit called commerce then you're crazy. People want to see their Bitcoin stashes grow over time like anything else and as long as their stash keeps growing people are more likely to spend.
Right now their stash isn't growing.

Definitely a good idea but depending only on Bitcoin means you're depending on a code base which wasn't designed to reward in this way.
An altcoin could set it up so miners only solve research problems and then people can just trade those coins for Bitcoins and you'd have the same results only researchers wouldn't have to pay for it because it would pay for itself if enough people decide to use the altcoin like this

But there are cameras in the store. The problem here is that it's a commercial centralized database company doing it rather than a decentralized way of doing it.
Self regulation decentralized is better than a central authority Bitcoin taint counsel. No one knows where their money came from and no one should have to care. If there are bad actors there has to be a way to put their addresses on a watch list without watching everyone.
Anyway I'm on the fence here. I think it may be necessary to have the capability to track money but I don't think it should be centralized and done for political reasons and I expect that this will be a political weapon used by people who want to control the economy for their personal benefit.

The more lines of code and more complex it is the more bugs there are. It's written in C++ so that leaves room for error as well.

It's irrational to associate banking as a concept with evil centralized banks. If there were many banks everywhere it could be just as decentralized as Bitcoin mining is if not more decentralized. So should we say mining exists only to centralize the problem of upping the hashrate? No. Centralization happened because of mining monopolies, not because mining itself somehow was designed to centralize. 
It wont be long before there are many Bitcoin backed banks which also mine and I think that could be good and bad depending on how many different banks there are. Neo Bee needs competition from credit unions and cooperatives.

That is not true. Do research into Mincoin. It's easier to mine and faster than Bitcoin, more scarce than Litecoin. It's basically better than Litecoin long term.
Litecoin is a very well marketed coin which was originally supposed to be a pump and dump coin but which became a legit contender. To determine whether a coin was or is designed for pump and dump just look at the total amount that is to be created and if that total amount is more than the total amount of Bitcoins (21 million) then you know it's just designed for pump and dump as it can never trade 1:1 with Bitcoin by design and so it's not designed to actually compete.

Why would they have to do that? Why would they want to? When something isn't directly owned by a corporation or government but collectively owned by a decentralized crowd then you don't have a government held responsible, or a corporation.

At the same time you're unrealistic if you think you wont have to pay some kind of tax. Transaction fees are a tax for instance. If you cash out into dollars you pay another tax. If you withdraw from an exchange you pay another tax. All the US government wants here is the right to tax us when we withdraw into USD. What is the problem with just paying that tax like everyone else who holds a foreign currency,  stocks, bonds?
Don't Bitcoin holders want to be treated like everyone else? Start acting like everyone else.

CONSUMING/SPENDING DOES NOT CREATE JOBS. SAVING AND INVESTING CREATES JOBS. 
Stop spreading that banker driven meme that the only thing a consumer can do is spend money. Banks hoard money and invest it and this is how jobs are created, but if you try to do it then it's hoarding and it's bad? That is how it has always been done, until its your turn and then it's a change of rules.

Approved of yes, created by no. Satoshi is not and was not an American citizen. He is believed to have been from the UK. If any government created it, it would have to be MI6 not the CIA.

It's not artificial. Bitcoins are worth whatever we want it to be worth. Artificial would be creating laws and rules to force people to not sell it and make it worth something. The point here is that if you just wait a year Bitcoin will be at least double the price it is now because new people keep coming in and old people aren't just going to leave it because Bitcoins are useful.
If you cannot figure it out, don't invest until it's in the thousands like gold is.

Isn't this what we wanted? The government to actually collect information and be careful about how to regulate cryptocurrencies?

But after each bubble the floor is a bit higher and there is a bit more infrastructure. The buying power has to be high enough (which $50,000 a coin and up) because that is the typical salary someone makes in a year and anyone can live off one Bitcoin so you have stability that way.
The other way is when people can live off of it and pay all bills etc. When you have that then its stable.

Cash isn't anonymous. Unless someone drops cash on the ground in the desert and you go pick it up, it's not anywhere near anonymous.
You go to an ATM and they have your face. You accept cash from another person and the person will tell the government they gave you cash. Cash just seems anonymous but if you send cash via snail mail then your finger prints can connect you to the cash.
The problem with anonymous cash is, if you can send cash anonymously then what happens to democracy? What happens when all politicians are anonymously bribed? Whoever has the most money can corrupt anybody with a big enough bribe.
