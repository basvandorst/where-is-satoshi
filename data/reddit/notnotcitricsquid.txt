Dogecoin is successful because they solved both problems that Bitcoin has for new users: bitcoin is years old and people joining now feel that they're "late" adopters (which is absurd) and people are scared of small numbers. A single bitcoin has been worth over $1000, sending someone 0.001 feels like you're sending them nothing, sending someone 100,000 DOGE feels like you're sending something (which is again absurd, but human behaviour is absurd!). 
Having a million doge feels good, having one BTC feels meh.
That said, Dogecoin has no longevity because although there's all this talk of fun and the tipping currency and yadda yadda yadda, there's an undercurrent of get rich quick that will inevitably be the downfall. However any cryptocurrency success (short term or long term) is good because it generates more interest, more interest = more development = more chance of cryptocurrency evolving enough and becoming a potential serious financial instrument. Right now the individual coins don't matter much, just the concept.

I was involved in running a popular site a while back (&gt;1.5 million uniques/m, &gt;30m page views) and we tried donations (usd, not bitcoin) as an alternative to advertisements. Donations are great short term if you have a donation drive type deal, but they are not maintainable long term, we found that while yes we could drum up serious financial support from our users one month (enough to cover costs) the amount of donations dropped off rapidly and even at peak the income didn't compare to what advertisements made. 1% of users might be happy to donate $20 towards a site they love *this* month, but they're not going to do it next. This is a cool experiment -- and if you can afford to do it, go for it -- but my experience leads me to believe it's not going to be a viable advertising replacement.
There are ways you can work towards making donations viable if you have the right audience (for example gamifying them, like reddit has done) but I don't believe that at this point in mind donations are a viable alternative to advertising, for almost every website.

They have 33 million subscribers. Assuming they have high volume so low payment processing rates would put it at probably 1%. If they charge $8/m that means they're probably spending $0.10? per transaction. 33 * 12 = ~400 million transactions per year. So that's $40m saved if they had *no* transaction fees.

How is it a courtesy to your readers? 99% of the *world* doesn't use double spacing, pick up any magazine or newspaper or pick any article on the internet and you'll find single spacing, I rarely if ever encounter double spacing on the internet but when I do it's annoying. Hell, most websites *actively remove* double spacing, you can't double space with HTML. Studies have shown that double spacing is not easier to read than single spacing.
You might like double spacing and if you want to do it, go for it, but the majority of the world doesn't use it and for most people single spacing is nicest because that's what they're used to. For me Double Spacing Is As Annoying To Read As Sentences With All Capital Letters.

Bitcoin is great, but you cannot deny (unless you are delusional) that for the majority of people Bitcoin is ass and PayPal is good. Bitcoin has the long term *potential* to become good for normal people and exceed the value that PayPal provides through companies like Coinbase, but *right now* you could not convert your mother or father to Bitcoin if they are a common PayPal user...
Just think of any scenario that would require PayPal for a normal person right now and see how well Bitcoin fits into the picture.
Scenario: Your mother wants to send your sister $500 so she can buy school books, she is currently in France on a student exchange program and only has a PayPal account, your mother is broke and wants to use her credit card. Your mother logs into PayPal, clicks send money, the payment is charged to her credit card and $500 arrives in your sisters PayPal account, which she can then withdraw / spend with her PayPal debit card. Yay, now she's got lots of ~~alcohol~~ school books.
Let's try that with Bitcoin. Your mother logs into coinbase and orders $500 worth of Bitcoins with her cred- wait, damnit, she can't do that. She goes to localbitcoins and- wait, no credit cards there either. Okay so she goes to withdraw cash from an ATM to buy bitcoins with cash, wait credit cards have huge penalties for cash advances and the limits don't allow her to withdraw $500... no bitcoins for mom!
Bitcoin is great and has the potential to be *the future* but right now it is not compatible with the current banking system and the way people treat money, which means it's not compatible for most normal people and claiming otherwise (and implying those that know this are morons) is just insulting yourself.

I won't reproduce the article but here's what it says in part:
* Founder Cedric Dahl 
* Buttercoin will compete with MtGox and a range of other money transmitting businesses (eg: Paypal)
* Buttercoin is operated by "Digital Currencies FinTech Co."
* Buttercoin is looking to partner with financial service companies
* Buttercoin has not struck any partnerships with banks but has inked several deals with remittance companies in India, Canada, Brazil and Hong Kong
* "Seed investor Mr. Ohanian said that Buttercoin eliminates foreign exchange risk for financial services firms. Based on this feature alone, he says, Buttercoin has the potential to massively disrupt the international remittance industry."
* "The benefit to a financial service company that becomes our partner is that [Buttercoin] gives them access to fee-free, bitcoin buying and selling," he said, adding that the company charges the end-user a 0.1% fee per transaction to use the service and splits that fee with its partner.
Article also mentions about bitcoin itself, coinbase has been funded by USV etc. but no mention if this is the reddit Buttercoin project. AFAIK it isn't.
Edit: the lead buttercoin (reddit) guy tweeted a few days ago:


No mention of funding or whatever, so I'm 99.99% sure they're not the same.
**edit edit** I think actually it is the same project!
The CEOs LinkedIn page mentions "NinjaTribe", the Twitter profile of Bennett Hoffman (lead mod) also mentions "NinjaTribe". I revise my statement: this is almost certainly the same project!

You don't invest in Bitcoin, you gamble.


Yes, it's possible, as is Bitcoin hitting £1000 a coin or £1 a coin. Nobody has a damn clue. Right now the price is on the up and up and confidence is very high, however this is exactly where confidence was in April and we remember what happened then, it dropped from ~£200 to £50 over night. 
If you want to try and make money:
1. Pick an amount of money you're okay with losing
2. Pick an amount of money you want to make
3. Buy BTC with the money you're willing to lose and then sell the moment it hits your sell target
Repeat until you're rich.
Don't get caught up in panic buying / selling. Don't get caught up in "to the moon" and don't ask people what is going to happen, you need to make your own decisions and for the love of god: only spend what you can afford to lose. If this is money that you need or matters to you a lot you'd be crazy to buy in.

I don't hate Bitcoin, I think cryptocurrency is fascinating and would love to see it succeed. 
The problem is that Bitcoin is like a pyramid scheme, the people that got in early get rich if they can convince later people to spend money and push up the value, this gives those that have invested a financial incentive to push Bitcoin on everyone and talk about how great it is, when they may not genuinely believe this. There is nothing to stop Bitcoin dropping to $0 tomorrow and everyone losing vast sums of money. 
Every positive post about Bitcoin is lining the pockets of early adopters, at the expense of new adopters, **unless** Bitcoin succeeds, which is not guaranteed.
Unlike investments in companies, Bitcoin has no tangible value, the value is entirely derived from the faith people have in Bitcoin... just like a pyramid scheme. I don't think Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme because it *could* have serious value (and impact) down the line, but at present the behaviour of the Bitcoin supporters is very much like those that support a pyramid scheme, people without knowledge of Bitcoin are right to be very sceptical.

Coinbase is a VC backed company, they've got investors who have put millions in (chicken feed to big investors) based on the gamble that maybe Bitcoin has huge potential and Coinbase is positioned to become the Paypal of Bitcoin.

I'm from England and have the opportunity to leave to one of the countries you listed but I'm choosing to remain. Taxes aren't *that* high, the government have big incentives on retirement saving (I get a significant tax cut for every payment made into my pension) and the amount of taxes I pay on my salary is less than what I'd pay in somewhere like New York. The high unemployment is just because we have so many unskilled workers, there's ample opportunity for skilled people. Dismal outlook... I guess out government sucks but no more so than America or Canada or Australia.
The UK isn't in great shape but you're exaggerating the problems we're facing at the moment. Perhaps long term it will go to shit, but right now we're no worse off than any of the countries you listed, and in some regards we're better off. Free (at the point of service) healthcare means that my taxes are helping people, much better personal safety... personally I value individual support far more than I value individual freedom which is why England is better for me.

I don't know what people you're interacting with on a day to day basis but in my experience the majority of people would happily pay no taxes and use no money on investing in their countries future by donating towards educational institutes and other things that benefit everyone. If someone takes home $20,000 they have to spend $20,000, if someone takes home $30,000 they have to spend $30,000, even if taxation was reduced the only thing that would change is the amount people spend on themselves, they wouldn't suddenly become generous... that's just first world culture, it's how we are. 
Maybe it's the case that people are taxed so much that they have no opportunity to put money towards charity and supporting causes but you clearly demonstrate that there are many ways to help charity that doesn't require money: why aren't charities overflowing with volunteers? It costs nothing to volunteer some time at a weekend but there isn't a surplus of charity workers, is there?
I donated money to charity (albeit a very small amount) when I was a broke teenager with almost nothing and now that I earn a lot more I donate more. I know people that made more than me as teenagers and didn't donate anything and now make good money and still don't donate anything, it isn't something people just suddenly do when they have a bunch of money, it's something someone either does or doesn't do as part of their life. I donate relative to my earnings, so yes if I had more money I would donate more but it would not be a nothing -&gt; something, it would be something -&gt; something. 
I guess I might just be jaded but I honestly believe that without enforced taxation very few people would put money towards a lot of things taken for granted. Also I'm not saying this as some college kid living off of taxes, I pay more tax per year than the average adult earns in my country and it would be great if I didn't have to pay taxes but I don't see how we could function... 
I absolutely agree that most first world governments are very inefficient and do a lot of things wrong and it would be fantastic if the government waste that occurs didn't but I do not see wiping out taxes as a solution to that, people are selfish and I think America proves that: America has a huge healthcare problem and the voting majority is against universal healthcare; sure there's government waste and it might not be efficient but it would be best for the citizens welfare, yet people instead vote based on their individual finances.
My country has *free* healthcare and it's an important part of this country, yet there are a significant number of people (thankfully not the majority) that vote against it, that want to see an American style system, because it would save them money... that sort of behaviour adequately demonstrates to me that people don't give a single fuck about what is best for everyone, they care about themselves.

@_date: 2013-09-05 20:31:20
No jesus christ no, putting all of your money into Bitcoin is crazy because Bitcoin is **not** an investment, it's a gamble. You're gambling on Bitcoin becoming successful: it's entirely possible that the price will drop to $60 tomorrow, it's also entirely possible the price will rocket to $200 tomorrow, but you can't know what will happen and if you put in money you need then you are being an absolutely, complete and utter, moron. Only put in what you can afford to lose.
There are people that bought in at $250 and then the next day it was worth half that, they lost 50% in a day and they've still not been able to make that money back and there is no guarantee they ever will. You're fundamentally right, if the price hits $150 tomorrow and you bought in at $75 then you'd get 100% returns, the problem is that is not guaranteed. The price is not stable.
@_date: 2013-09-05 20:42:04
Don't try and apply any sort of logic to what is happening with Bitcoin. The price is **not** linked to the amount mined, it is **not** linked to the amount of people spending, it is **entirely** linked to the amount of confidence individuals have in Bitcoin (which changes every second) and the behaviours of those manipulating the market to make short term gains. 
Long term Bitcoin will either succeed (in which case each individual coin is going to become worth a significant amount of money) or it will fade away and become something that a few people use (like now) because they enjoy the concept. If Bitcoin succeeds then yes, those that have bought in now are going to make serious money but that is very very unlikely.

oh absolutely, there's a lot of places Bitcoin can do much better than the current banking system, however it is the case that in some countries (eg: America) their banking system is actually further behind a lot of the other first world countries, so it's worth remembering that.

What matters is vested interest, you stand to gain from the company you work being successful, if that company takes off and becomes the next mt.gox (eg: it has a significant market share) your employer will pay you more and you'll be in a better position. Your comment here is money in your pocket, it's advertising.
McDonalds is a reasonable example but the bottom line impact of an employee convincing someone to purchase a Big Mac instead of going to KFC is negligible, however even in that situation the right thing to do is be honest: I work for McDonalds and suggest you have a Big Mac, it's much better than KFC, *I know* and here's why: we use the best meat...
People assume by default that someone is impartial, if you read a review on yelp or see someone talking about how great the latest iPhone is you assume that they are a consumer with experience and are talking about the product just because they *care*, now imagine if the reviews were from Apple employees, an Apple employee is certainly not going to mention that there are some concerns about the security of finger print scanning, or that some people are not happy with the direction the app ecosystem is taking, but a customer might.
The company you work for could be terrible, when you comment "it works very smoothly" that isn't from experience, that's from an understanding of how the system works, but how systems work is not always the reality of how they work for consumers and when someone reads "it works very smoothly" they think: "this guy has used it and knows how it works and doesn't have anything bad to say! I'll check them out" but that isn't strictly true, is it?
Personally I'm always responsible with disclosing any vested interest in anything, you'll often find that it works to your advantage because in a world full of scummy business practices and shady characters, honesty and openness are very much valued by consumers. Saying "Hey, I work for ibwt a new UK exchange, we've got features x y and z and you'll be verified on Monday! Do you have any questions about how we work?" will pay off for you, because the person reading will think "cool! They care about me enough to post? That's great!".
It's fine that you didn't think about it that way this time, but long term you should absolutely keep it in mind. *Personally* I don't care if you do or don't, it's not going to impact my life in any way, but in my experience it's best for customers and it's best for you to be responsible with your disclosure. Regulated industries mandate responsible disclosure so it only makes sense to carry that over to Bitcoin so that people take BTC seriously, otherwise we'll end up the wild west.
Good luck with the launch of ibwt, I'm also from the UK so I'll check it out at launch, looks interesting.

For exchanges they don't really trade Bitcoins. When you buy 10 BTC on MtGox or Bitstamp, all you're doing is updating an entry in their database, the exchange retains access to the coins and nothing is moved. The most secure way to manage an exchange would be to keep the amount you expect people to need to withdraw over a period of time (say 10%) in an accessible wallet and then securely store the rest offline. If an exchange is hacked there will be losses, but they can still return coins to people.

I'm almost 100% sure we know who Satoshi is. There was a group of 3 people who, 1 day before the Bitcoin whitepaper was released, patented something very much related to Bitcoin that contains similar wording. Satoshi is Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry.
With regards to hoarding btc: the blockchain is a public ledger, bitcoins only exist if they're recorded by the blockchain so you can go back and look at the first transactions and see where the bitcoins went.

For reference I administrate the Minecraft Forum and spend a portion of my time working with Minecraft Server Hosts (well, "working with", dealing with their shit) so I have some familiarity with the market.
Your site doesn't sell the service. I land on your site and it feels like a sort of thing a friend might send to say "hey can you quickly sign up to my beta and test it out?", it doesn't feel like a site that I might visit from an advert / recommendation and have confidence in. There's no website like structure and what is there is confusing. I'm a customer that wants a service, so I just want to pick and click "buy", but instead I have to register an account first? There's a reason most checkout processes don't do that: it doesn't convert well. After registering and playing around with the UI it feels like the sort of UI a developer makes, it's not *bad* but it's not intuitive and there are "gotchas", like after spawning a server I'm taken to a page with options ("Refund") so I figure "huh, do I need to refund, did something go wrong?", then I notice at the top of the page (outside of where I was focused) "Your server request is being processed, please wait." but there's no feedback. The moment you have a lack of feedback on what is happening people start to panic and get confused. If I was a customer I'd be sending a ticket now asking why my time is counting down (which is spending my money) if my server isn't online!
Secondly, the unfortunate reality is your business model doesn't fit the server hosting landscape. There was a company that launched about 18 months ago called Minefold that used the same model as you and they discovered that it doesn't really scale, because people will only play for a few hours a week and there's no real way to turn that into good revenue. A "normal" server company charges anywhere from $10 to $50 for a "normal" Minecraft server, so when they're running 1000 customer servers they have at least $10,000 coming in. You could be running 1000 customer servers and pulling in only $100... how do you support staff, infrastructure (although I assume you're just using EC2 based on the naming structure) and general running costs on no tangible revenue? The real killer when running a business is people. Meat is expensive.
There's a lot of potential to do some really cool stuff in the server hosting market, but I don't think that the hourly billing model is compatible with the way that people play on servers. How many hours of play time do you need to make enough money to just pay your salary? There's a cost to acquire each individual customer (through marketing etc.) and the amount you'll make per customer isn't going to cover that. Say hypothetically a person plays 2 hours every single day on every day of every month on one of your servers, which is a pretty hardcore player and you stand to make the grand total of... $3 per month from them **before costs**. That's abysmal and just will not provide enough revenue to support your company. Do you have projections of what you need to secure with regards to customer base?
Your technology is really cool but it won't fit well here. I highly recommend that you contact the people behind Minefold because they were a VC funded company who tried a variety of different models (per server billing, per person billing, credits) all around the usage based billing model and ultimately it never seemed to work for them. They'll probably be able to give you some pointers (eg: let you know if it's a fools errand or not). Here is their "we're shutting down" blog post that summarises:  The Minefold site was really nice, they had some awesome features (interactive maps, inviting friends) and it just wasn't enough to rescue the model, and now you're competing with Minecraft Realms, which will pretty much cannibalize the "simple servers" market.
The fortunate thing is that starting a standard hosting company is pretty much the same technology as what you have now and the barrier to entry is just being technology capable and having a few hundred dollars, just transfer what you have over to running on dedicated servers and you could turn this into a good business making more than enough to pay your salary and a couple of support staff, then you could perhaps branch out and try and learn about how to make the hourly model work, but I can tell you for an unfortunate fact that the hourly model is not good enough to sustain you.
To summarise: your model won't work, but fortunately you have the skills to do normal server hosting, which is easy to get into, build a small self sustaining company and then once you're covering costs you can take it from there and branch out into the creative ideas you have (like hourly billing). That will give you the tolerance for bad ideas and teach you a lot about what customers *really* want.
If you are committed to this model, you should come over to minecraftforum.net and advertise :) Many successful hosting companies used us to launch.

What web server does bitcointalk.org use? This seems too blindingly obvious to be the problem but it's fairly common to be able to upload and execute files through file uploading (in this case avatars) when using nginx in a lot of open source forum packages (they all seem to do it wrong...) [if nginx is configured improperly]( Happened to me once, I can't imagine you could have lasted this long though as it's like, the first thing anyone malicious would try, but might be worth expanding on your stack so people know more about the possible attack vectors. What version of SMF are/were you using? That would help narrow it down. 
For now you could maybe bring a new server online with a backup and have every POST request blocked, so although people could read the forum they won't be able to post and exploit anything... seems like a reasonable solution as bitcointalk.org has a lot of posts that people reference to, or maybe even throw something together that generates a flat file version of the site and route people to that, although probably time better spent working out what happened.

I'm convinced that **IF** Bitcoin succeeds (note: not crypto-currency, specifically Bitcoin) it will be because a company (like Paypal) comes in and uses Bitcoin as a *protocol* and builds out their own banking layer on top of it, which is what will get widespread adoption. The protocol will be used for passing money between merchants (similar to how banks work now) but consumer x won't be spending actual bitcoins.
When you walk into Walmart and buy $50 of groceries on your card you're not spending $50, you're "spending" "$50". Bitcoin is like giving customers access to a banks actual *funds*, it's like creating a literal box that has the customers money in it, it would be nonsensical, it completely undermines how money works and how money has worked for centuries. Consumer protections are just one facet of that.

You're mistaken about how pensions work.
You **cannot** withdraw money from your pension before you are at the pension age (currently 55). There is no tax on doing it because it is categorically impossible, any attempt to do so is illegal and subject to heavy heavy fines. They would never allow you to put the money outside of a regulated pension provider, BTC will never be a direct option. Saying "tax me if I spend it" doesn't fit the pension model.  
The only option to get money back that you've paid into a pension before retirement age is if you cancel the pension *within 2 years of it starting* and you will be refunded your contributions, less the government and employer contributions. This will be taxed at your standard rate.
You could have your pension invested in BTC if there was a BTC backed fund available through your provider. For example I can invest my pension (through Aviva) in anything they have available, a BTC fund could theoretically become available... 
Also your support for BTC is nice but I hope you understand that *if* GBP becomes worthless there are going to be so many problems bigger than losing your pension. We will be so completely fucked, having a few hundred bitcoins will not save you.

If it WAS Cyprus that caused the bubble... 
according to news articles the cyprus bank government theft thing was 37.5% for $150,000 (as in, if you had 150k in bank government took 37.5%). If someone bought $150,000 of bitcoin at the peak ($250) they would have 600 BTC which is now worth $52,800, if they had left the money in their bank account and let the government take the 37.5% they would have $93,750 in the bank.
So if cyprus people did move their money to Bitcoin, they've lost money thus far and won't break even until BTC hits $156.25.

Ahh I didn't mean to do that. You've demonstrated a lot of skill to build this, it's just the case that it's an idea that *probably* isn't compatible with the market based on what I know -- although I don't know everything so maybe I'm very very wrong. The good thing is the skills you've gained are very transferable, so no matter what happens you can always recover. If you want to try this then go for it, *personally* if I was in your situation I'd use your skills to build a "traditional" hosting company, run it to profitability and then use the security of that to try lots of crazy ideas, but then I'm cautious and nobody ever achieved much being cautious haha.

Yeah, UI is one of those things that is just so difficult to do right. I spend more time trying to design a good interface when building sites than I do actually writing code.


I don't think it necessarily needs to be done that way, I think a better onboarding process would be easier. For example imagine if a user could click "get a server now" and go through the picking process (size, set the properties) and then on the last page it'll say "okay, to create this server please register", that way they're invested in the product already (they've put their time into configuring!) so you just make them register and take that data and create a new server. Depending on the structure of your site that will be fairly easy, just store their server config options in a temporary table while they register, no re-architecturing required. The idea is that you want to get your users to get to the point where they're not willing to give up, before they have to do something difficult or not *fun*. If I land on a site and the first thing I see is "register" I think, "eh it's probably not worth it", if I land on a site and see "click here to get a server" -&gt; "enter server name" -&gt; "pick server size" -&gt; "register", by the time I'm at the register page I've already entered all that info, I don't want to have wasted my time! That sort of thing has a huge positive impact on conversion.


The problem is that you need that to work at scale to be a business and you're not just making a website, you're providing a service and service **requires** support. The worst thing you can do is not provide users support, because that will kill your reputation so fast. Think about the amount of servers you need to sell to hit certain milestones. Let's take your example of $10 with $7 costs. For someone to pay you $10 they'll need to either use 200 hours of a spot request server or 50 hours of an on demand server. Most people are going to think "fuck it" and go for the spot request because it's cheap (people will be using your service for the price first, ease of use second (see Minefolds blog post)). How many people do you think are going to spend 200 hours on your service *ever*, let alone with any regularity? The sort of people that would use your service are casual players not willing to pay for monthly but willing to pay hourly aren't going to be the sort of players that play 10 hours a day, because for those people it'd be more economical to buy a full server.
You can see where it's going here right, the amount of revenue per user is going to be very low because they must: 
* Be willing to spend money online
* Not be willing to spend money monthly
* Not play enough for a monthly server to be better value
* Not be using the Minecraft Realms service
* Not be playing on a pre-existing server
The market shrinks with every bullet point. Then on top of that consider the amount of money you'll make: I'll make up an "average" person: an average person plays 20 hours per month, that's $1.08 revenue for you if they're on a medium spot request, but you're paying $0.86 to Amazon just for the server, so already you're down to $0.22 to cover everything outside of your server costs.
1,000 "average" customers: $220
10,000 "average" customers: $2,200
100,000 "average" customers: $22,000
That's before the cost of operating a business, before the cost of hiring anyone to manage support tickets, that's before dealing with payment fees, that's before dealing with refunds. The cost of supporting 10,000 customers is going to far exceed $2,200 per month, $2200 won't even be a livable salary for one person! The cost of supporting 100,000 customers is going to far exceed $22,000 per month... so on and so forth.
The only way you could make this work financially would be if you have customers deposit say $20 up front (which they'll never spend all of) and then use the new deposits to fund the services ongoing costs, but that isn't sustainable long term.


That will reduce your attractiveness, mods are one of the driving forces behind Minecraft. 


I've thought about this a lot, something I want to do (and almost did do many years ago) is start my own Minecraft server hosting company doing something *innovative*, unfortunately hourly billing just isn't it. There isn't a market for it, the tiny little market there was for "easy" servers is being eaten up by Realms the moment Mojang launch it and **even if** it was possible to pull in 10,000 customers... the financials of it are unsustainable.
Then there's the other games like Counter Strike and TF2. Why would someone pay you to set up their own server just to play on for a few hours when they can click "Join friends" in game -- Valve identified that easy playing with friends was an issue and have built out this stuff to solve that problem. Your servers would only be attractive to those that want long term servers with specific configurations, but your billing is prohibitive to that sort of usage because it'd cost $100 / month with you for a server they could get for $20 / month elsewhere.
I highly highly recommend that you reconsider focusing on the hourly model. I don't know about your financial situation so perhaps you have the runway to try this for many years to come, but if you don't you should definitely consider starting up a traditional company, bootstrap it to profitability and then use that experience, those connections and that money to support cool ideas like this, ideas that probably won't work but are worth a try.
Anyway, good luck regardless, I don't mean to be so negative but this is a tough market to try and conquer and I've been thinking about it a lot recently so this is a good of a time as any to dump my thoughts. If you do push forward with it, I hope you succeed and I'll owe you a drink for doubting :)

I don't have time to rewrite it and send a pull request right now but the easiest way to improve it would be to switch to some form of templating, which would also mean you could remove the jQuery dependency. Manually constructing HTML the way you have done it is very cumbersome and slower than it could be, but the code isn't *horrible*, I guess that guy is just upset he isn't capable of shipping something :D

If you have no idea what you're doing **don't risk it** and try filing yourself instead find an accountant, pay them a few hundred dollars and have them deal with it for you.
Filing taxes should be easy but when you're confused you can do yourself a lot of damage. The good news for you is if your taxes are filed properly you won't owe any money, you don't pay tax on losses.

Do you live outside of major cities? 2000 square feet is HUGE for a lot of the world, for example I just moved into a ~2100 square feet house, it's the biggest house I've ever been in... my parents house (where I grew up) is ~1000 square feet max (that 5 people lived in) and my apartments that I rented for the last few years have all been 500 - 700 square feet. How much rent do you pay?
I'm in England btw.

Maybe he realised that living like a millionaire with no apparent job was not a good idea, so he decided that the most sensible thing to do would be to save all the money until he had the chance to move on from SR, either through moving to another country or something else? His strategy was apparently very good, except for the few dumb mistakes he made. Maybe he just doesn't care about money, after all he seemed to talk often about his intentions being to change the world.

This lends weight to the speculation[1] that Paypal were going to get involved with BTC (as Paypal own ebay). Interesting!

You need to understand that the majority of Bitcoin supporters are people with money in Bitcoin: they stand to make financial gains from more people buying in and so they have a **financial incentive** to convince every shmuck to buy in. People made a lot of money off of the people that bought into Bitcoin in April without really thinking about what they were doing. 
Anyone telling you that it's more likely for Bitcoin to succeed than fail is delusional. Yes, it has huge potential (and I personally would love to see it succeed) but it is not a sure thing that it will succeed. Spend some time thinking about what exactly needs to happen for Bitcoin to be something everyone uses and you'll realise just what Bitcoin is up against. Reddit is a site full of technology literate people and yet it's frequent to see complaints about people having their wallets stolen: if a technology literate person can't manage their bitcoins, what hope is there for your parents? 
Almost everything new fails, look at the success rate of your average restaurant or startup, Bitcoin isn't immune to those problems.
Long term with companies like Coinbase getting involved there is a chance, but it's going to take many many years and some serious investments from companies to get Bitcoin ready for normal people consumption. There's a big question of whether or not that will happen. Convincing yourself Bitcoin can't fail is a sure fire way to make some really awful financial decisions.

This is the reaction that needs to happen if you all want to make money from Bitcoin. People need to think it's bat shit crazy at first and then as the presence grows they'll start to think more and more about it and start to put money into Bitcoin.
Surely everyone here, when they first heard of Bitcoin, thought "that's... strange?" and then they heard of it a few more times, started to investigate, learned that actually it does seem like an interesting idea and then started to look at it seriously: they would be just as "stupid" if they thought this was genius based on the description they were given as they are "stupid" for thinking it is utterly bizarre. 
Bitcoin IS utterly bizzare, the future IS bizzare. They're not morons or whatever you think they are, they're just people. This is how everyone reacts to new things they've not really looked into.

I'd be inclined to believe it's a scam too, however the email was addressed to his name *and* the amount matches what he claims he magically found in his Coinbase account:


Seems fairly clear this is genuine, I'd argue it's almost impossible for the following to happen:
* Coinbase "accidentally" credit him with &gt;4 BTC
* Scammer finds out / guesses that he was mistakenly credited with &gt;4 BTC
* Emails claiming he stole &gt;4 BTC and he must "restore his account"
I'll put a dollar on this being genuine, although this is poor quality email from Coinbase... they should never encourage a user to click on a link to do anything, it should always be "Visit coinbase.com" which is not hyperlinked.

Don't worry, although there are a lot of vocal fuckwits like this guy, the majority are just people that spend all day posting dumb reddit comments and have literally no impact on the reality of BTC.

You don't have to be talking on behalf of the company to be responsible in your disclosure. If you don't want anyone to think you're representing the company when you comment just say, "I work for x but these are my personal comments".

The world is changing / evolving so rapidly that 21 trillion dollars market cap on a global currency isn't implausible. If Bitcoin were to reach the levels of ubiquity that would make it *the* currency it's possible. I can't imagine it happening but maybe in 10 years? Who knows...

It's a great feature that will absolutely destroy your business. What happens if your service has high levels of usage (let's say 100 BTC per day of transactions) and the price of BTC is at $1k/coin, then it drops 90% overnight? You're going to be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars, which will end your business...

The way some web servers work with default configuration allows it to happen. You tell the web server (through configs) that any request ending in .php should be assumed to be a PHP file and executed as such, so if software running on the server allows people to upload a file and allows it to be accessed via an http request ending in ".php" the web server may execute it.
This is common with some basic php nginx configurations, caught myself out with it about 18 months ago, fortunately nobody abused it and I was able to rectify it. Here's a good summary:

Do you use gmail? A common thing a couple of years ago was to login to someone's gmail account and set up a filter (eg: when an email from btc-e arrives, forward to x and delete). Verify that your email address hasn't been compromised, if you're using gmail it provides a login history showing who logged in and when and from where. If they got into your BTC-E account they probably got into your email account too (same password?).

Nobody sane has ever said that. **Never trust a web wallet** because what is legal prosecution if it doesn't get your money back? If someone wants to steal millions of dollars then the law is not going to stop them doing so.
You would never let some unregulated institution hold your fiat, why would you let an unregulated institution hold your Bitcoins? Any money kept in web wallets or exchanges *is* vulnerable.

Please be a bit more ethical. If you have a conflict of interest disclose it at the earliest opportunity, advertising a company that you're involved with as "they" (implying you are not part of them) is very misleading and not at all what a genuine business should be doing. Be open and honest.

Bitcoin won't compete with PayPal, Bitcoin will become an underlying protocol for the financial system, which PayPal will run on top of. Does PayPal compete with BoA? No, they're *different*. Bitcoin does not threaten PayPal in any meaningful way.
If Bitcoin succeeds the average joe isn't going to be opening Bitcoin QT to send their mom money for her birthday, they're going to be using a service (either an online wallet, or insured Bitcoin "bank") because an individual user cannot safely manage their own bitcoins. Sure, the power user *can* if they want manage and control their own bitcoins (which is awesome, and the group that most of this subreddit fits into) but the average person won't, and PayPal is so perfectly positioned to be that online wallet that can run on top of Bitcoin.
PayPal charges high fees and has problems with holding peoples balances, in part, because of the highly regulated banking systems around the world. If you send someone $100 via PayPal through your credit card and that person withdraws the money, and then you do a chargeback it's PayPal that loses *a lot* of money ($100 + $25). PayPal don't want to do half of the shit they do, but they don't have a choice because it's part and parcel of the fiat banking system.

However if Bitcoin is valuable and reaches the users goals of becoming a currency in its own right that people can use exclusively won't there be problems buying small things?
Let's say I'm ordering Pizza that would cost $15, right now I would say "This pizza costs 0.09 BTC". If the value of a BTC rose to $1300 each then it would be 0.009 BTC for a pizza. Who wants to be working in such weird values? They're awkward and not at all friendly.
Alternatively if everyone is using mBTC it's just "oh that pizza is 9 mBTC" which is so much easier to deal with. Most people make lots of small purchases, a currency should be most usable in that situation. That doesn't even consider that a lot of people find math difficult, small numbers are easy but the psychological barrier when it comes to &lt;1 can be confusing. 
buying an awesome TV? 2 BTC! Buying a pizza 9 mBTC! Simple. 
You're asking people to use a new currency and change how they think about money, introduces a much bigger problem to overcome instead of being relatively simple.
