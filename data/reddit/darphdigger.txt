If you only have an extra $1000, you should absolutely not buy any high-risk investments. No offense meant but that's very little savings to have. Be proud of the extra money you built up, and save it in a high-yield savings account, while building upon it.

It's because, as pointed out to you, you are the one not being realistic. If someone discovers a critical flaw in the security of btc and its network, it will be $100 or less in a heartbeat. 
In addition, saying "guaranteed" it will double if held for a while is especially egregious, hence the downvotes.

Couple of points: 
The fed *may* be raising rates soon. Looks likely. We'll know at 2pm today. 
There is reason to believe that bitcoin will go up with the raise of rates, not down. And as a matter of fact, part of this recent bull movement is likely a pricing-in of the predicted rate hike.

@_date: 2015-12-16 15:45:26
That's actually what I'm saying. The fed rate hike will likely devalue the yuan, which is why there's a pricing-in from the Chinese. The lack of relation to the USA is exactly why the BTC/USD would go UP after a rate hike, not down as one might expect.

Disclaimer: I'm not an entrepreneur myself, but I have a doctoral minor in Entrepreneurship. 
Quick note: "Seek equity from an angel..." - I think you mean seek financing. Equity is what you would be giving the angel in return. 
Also, you mentioned that you might be better off doing product development rather than solidifying your business plan (if I understood you correctly): I strongly recommend that you don't over-develop until you fully understand your market and have validated your customers to the extent that you can write a solid, fully defensible business plan (I realize in the world of Bitcoin things move fast, but still...). Take a look at the Customer Development philosophies of famed start-upper Steve Blank, as it contrasts to the more typical (and very common for new entrepreneurs) way of looking at things, which is product development centric. 
The first chapter of the book Blank wrote called "Four Steps to the Epiphany" is available free online. Here you go:  Strongly recommended read. 
Good luck, it's a really cool idea!

I'm somewhat disappointed to see that short of two-thirds of people (many coming from this sub) have bought something with Bitcoin before. If you are a holder and haven't bought something yet...do it! Just buy back immediately before or after, depending no your preference.

The reason why there are so many metaphors is because all things have come from only a small set of fundamental truths.
I spent years trying figure those truths out, but the closer I got to narrowing them down, the more language broke down and made everything seem paradoxical. Besides, it is an overly existential endeavor, one finds. So I stopped doing that and now I just play trombone.

My friend, I did your survey but just wanted to make a note about the education choices...your "other" category would include both people without a high school diploma as well as people with professional doctorates and other post-masters degrees. As someone who has such a doctorate, I didn't really want to choose "other" so I chose PhD, which is technically not accurate, but I'm guessing gets at your intention.
Edit: In addition, I have three accurate possibilities for the relationship with bitcoin question (heard of it, invested in it, and purchased goods with it). I think this option should be available for multi-select.

It's not that scanning a QR code and/or copying and pasting is inherently "hard"...in fact, not many things are *truly* difficult to achieve. Things are either more or less familiar to the person, which affects perceived difficulty. Complicated and complex philosophical discussion to be had there, but suffice it to say that the problem is that many potential users aren't familiar with the protocols for bitcoin, and making them seem more familiar and user-friendly is a good thing.

Excellent post. Thanks for showing the respect that normal humans should get, regulators or not. It was explicitly obvious that something of this order was going to happen, and it doesn't need to be a bad thing (as the price changes today reflect). Rapport is important, as Lawsky and other regulators are a heck of a lot more powerful than most of the people on reddit. If we want to ensure a powerful future for bitcoin, we need to be able to effectively communicate concerns, not shout like children. Have a beer at happy hour @_date: 2014-07-21 23:59:32
That's true, I understand that, but I don't necessarily think that purchasing a product necessarily means you are an "investor." Anyway, just my opinion.

Was here in October when I came up from Tennessee for Game 2 of the ALDS. Specifically came for the novelty of paying in bitcoin, but it turned out to be an amazing bar. Huge "encyclopedia" of cocktails, seemingly endless selection and combinations thereof, good food, and very knowledgeable barkeeps. Awesome place, even better with a BTM now.

You can buy bitcoin at any division all the way down to the single "Satoshi," which is one one - hundred - millionth of a full coin. 
If you're interested in buying some, head on over to coinbase.com and see how it works.

I'm not a newbie, per se, but I do have a very basic question:
There have been two scenarios where I wanted to use bitcoin, but wasn't able to due to certain restrictions. I realized in these moments that they seemed extremely important to overcome in order for bitcoin to be viable as a method of transacting money, especially as the touted international currency. 
In one scenario my phone was dying in a bar that accepted bitcoin, which was a critical part of my ability to pay. The other scenario I was in a foreign country and did not have data access on my phone. 
I have heard about the transmission of transactions via radio wave possibility, but are there any other outstanding efforts being made to solve these problems?

Okay I didn't win but for some reason that was really fun to watch. 
You might consider lowering the entry price while you get started to something like $1-$2 worth of BTC, to attract more people who just think "well it's only $1 dollar let's see what happens."

That's a very big discount. Like, strangely big.
I'm not normally the conspiracy guy, but 9/1 is the GABI launch date, and in the case that the higher ups have some inside knowledge of the amount of the initial buys/investment, it might be Newegg that is taking money from you, not the other way around. In fact, that's what businesses are supposed to do. Honestly, more power to them if that's the case. I'll be watching carefully though, that would certainly be an interesting strategy.

Yes, we are in that stage of the tech adoption life cycle. The 2014 (and likely 2015) Gartner Hype Cycle also supports this, when overlaid with the TALC. However, you chose a graph that doesn't show "the chasm." 
The Chasm is important because it is by a long shot the place that most technologies fail. So for the person that said "we might be in the laggards stage now," you have to realize that not every technology actually makes it around the entire curve. The great majority of  innovative technologies fall right into the chasm, which is, to me, exactly what we are testing now. We probably have until the middle of 2016 to leap it successfully. [](
Here's the Gartner Hype Cycle for 2014, in case you haven't seen it. [](

Nice post. Didn't manually check numbers, so currently trusting that side...
I think the bank&gt;cash side is the more desirable route, re: many families not having a bank account and many third-world vendors not accepting anything but cash. Going straight to cash seems to just cut out another step that many of the people using Rebit and like services would have undergone anyway.
It would be nice to see Rebit and others be competitive with the bank&gt;bank side as well, but I think the larger battle is the one which they are already winning.

To give an honest opinion, as someone who studied business/branding, I'm not really fond of the name. "Money packet" basically describes what it literally is, or is literally analogous to, and in some ways I think it's a bit too direct and needs more hook. Just one man's opinion of course.

I think you're misunderstanding. The candle on August 10th was the last one of the line, when, yes, the price was already in consistent decline. This candle is the first candle, more akin to the first green of that cycle, which began in May. All it shows at this point is that we've finally had enough extended upswing to turn the MACD green, therefore hopefully (for a holder or long positions) signaling the end of a downward trend.

I agree that of course there is not anything inherently special with the 1W, but it is the retrospective significance that makes the moment unique, and hopefully telling. There is something to said for the fact that we have failed to have any extended growth since last summer, a fact that of course we would expect with the full-on bear market that has been present, and the changing of which might therefore tell us that we are in fact not in a bear market any longer. Whether that is short, medium, or long-term remains to be seen.

My biggest problem is that Bitcoin is not actually faster or more convenient for in-store, physical purchases. It is incredible for transferring large and/or exact sums to anyone, anywhere, but buying stuff, say, at target, would be cumbersome. Meanwhile, the community spent much of 2014 focused on improving merchant adoption, with a special focus on local brick-and-mortar businesses. This is something that bitcoin isn't really ready for, in terms of the average Joe. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:54:00
If bitcoin purchases would be treated like goods and not cash advance then I would say yes, but as of now it's useless and dangerous.

We flirted with it a couple times, but never confirmed, and today we finally had the first confirmed green candle since the end of the May run-up to the $600s. That bull-run was also the only one in the green after the Mt. Gox spike and crash.

That's a big ol' sample size of 1, my man. 
Reality: if bitcoin was a market based simply and fully on supply and demand, we'd probably have a lower price, not a higher one. Speculation drives bitcoin price at this point in the evolution of the coin, and that is the case now. 
The speculation effect in advance of the halvening is, IMO, certainly much greater than the actual effect of the lessening of supply. This is what we are seeing now as the "rumor" becomes "news."
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:01:23
