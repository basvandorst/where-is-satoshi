How does this not damage the electronics.. I've never seen anything like this in my life this is insane

Exactly how I feel though.. when it hit 8000 and only dipped to 7800 I waited and waited.. then 9000 and I still waiting for the dip to 8500 or 8000.... now it's almost 10k and I'm very bittersweet about it

I think I understand what you are saying, I appreciate the help! I'll download electrum and see what I can figure out from there.. my primary use for bitcoin was a: to hold it as an investment currency and b: some online purchases seem to actually prefer bitcoins so I get certain privileges/ benefits to paying with them.. I seem to be having a harder time understanding due to trying to use it as a traditional currency such as PayPal with the added use of investing via fluctuating prices

So forking gives you additional coins (small amounts)? Thanks for the info I understand how coin base works now!

Thanks for the response. I had some concerns I addressed in my other response but if you have the time and want to quickie explain, the only knowledge I have is from the official bitcoin site which I thought I read everything... and I have no clue what blockchains and forking have to do with owning bought coins... I thought that stuff only had to do with mining.. does that mean my value could randomly half?

Understood! Thanks

Is there an official place to buy it? I think this is what I was told to get... it's a hardware piece that holds my private key and makes the only real risk plugging into a pc with a virus or losing the physical device, correct?

Okay now I'm confused a little bit again. How do you gain access to the forked coins if it's in a hardware wallet? How do you even know if you got any extra coins? From plugging it in and checking every once in a while?

So I guess a follow up question would be... should I even attempt to invest and use bitcoins with only phone access..? I don't have a computer currently due to my line of work keeping me away from home for months at a time. Also apparently I haven't researched this enough... as I have no clue what difference chosing my own blockchain would have.. and what "forking"is.. but from how it's worded it makes me believe my value could randomly half on me which isn't what I'm interested in

That makes a lot of sense, thank you

Is a hardware wallet just one of those usb sticks that you can essentially plug in to a computer and have access to? So the only real risk is losing the physical device?
