Great post, and this is important. The day that BTC becomes **easy to purchase** and **easy to use** is the day it spikes in value. Economies are becoming increasingly global, and there's certainly value in a universal currency - not having to pay currency conversion fees, for instance. Of course, that has its own economic implications with the banks, but I digress...
Right now, it's almost a conceptual prototype, since it's not easily accessible to a wider audience. Whatever cryptocurrency becomes _easily accessible_ (bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, the ICO Floyd Mayweather invested in, etc.) is the one that will go big, and the others will flounder. 
It really does feel like a crapshoot as to which one takes off at this stage. It's like choosing which automobile engineer's company should be invested in before there was ever an assembly line. Lord knows Henry Ford wasn't the only one working on automobiles before 1908.
