Only if you sell.

Tax season is upon us and many folks will be forced to sell to settle taxes.  This is why we could see strong selling pressure through April or even May (I read South Korea's last tax date is May 31).
Keep this in mind and HODL on tight! The Summer will be a rip. Avoid the FUD in the meantime and stop checking cryptomarketcap daily. Only check 1 day a week. Get a hobby or go outdoors. Your anxiety will thank you.
ON THE FLIP SIDE. All the FOMO folks may use tax returns to buy crypto...should be an interesting few months. Don't look too deep into things.

And from what I can gather stock is NOT qualified property for LKEs.

Yes, actually. That is INCOME. Read the IRS definition. It is anything you can imagine.

1) Initially invested
2) Spread out into potfolio of cryptos, weighted for cap size to some degree.
3) Slowly divesting over time
4) Either keeping divested funds in stock market in case new opportunities arise or shoving into tax advantaged account - traditional ira...also helps with current taxes a bit.
5) Will always keep some in cryptos, keep liquid funds to act quickly when opportunities arise.
Edit: may change some funds into money market account for better liquidity. I acted fast as possible when "big banks investing in Eth" story hit the news earlier this year. By the time I sold stock, transferred to bank, then coinbase, it had already gone from $11 to $20 and I ended up with far fewer eth.

Except no one knows what is high and often times low. I bet a shtt ton of people sold at 10k for instance. Market timing is notoriously black magic. Hell, market schiller p/e has been over 20 a couple years now. Thus why HODL is not just coin advice, but general investment advice. Buffett is biggest HODLer ever.

Currency gains taxed as income. Gains are currently taxed as property, much better. Doubt they will ever recognize as official currency.

I think you may have a reasonable point though. To those that gained and sold 5k+ may owe the irs. Those that sold 10, 20k+ will surely.

The worst part of all this will be tracking basis. Doubt exchanges will have automated reports. Coinbase apparently has some functionality.

Whats the point then?  Take 90% loss and go back to t-bills and short term bonds? No thanks. Ride it out and never panic.

There is always a difference. But cant arbitrage as a non-Korean.

Did you read he held for years? He only mooned in Dec and had 30 days before it crashed. The timeframe for the peak was so short and we had risen for so long, many folks didnt take their moon right away. Why would if you saw moon 2x or 4x or 10x coming up?  Moons are relative and can quickly multiply when btc skyrocketed. Who the hell thought they would buy lambos is 2013?

Lol giving up your entire life for 1m? Maybe 800k after tax? Stupidity. 
It's just tax, maybe 18% plus state. How snobby can you be to think poor working folks pay their damn taxes and you, a hodler making insane PASSIVE gains, as part of the investor class, shouldn't pay tax?!  Sounds like some elitist banker BS.

Which is why we need a real fund backed by real btc for the common folks on vanguard and fidelity. Not this illusion.

I'm not sure how many states do. NC taxes it the same as all other income at 5.5%.
