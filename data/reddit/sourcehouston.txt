I think keeping a bit on exchanges is smart to get in and out of things quickly. Obviously its better to keep everything off but that can make it more difficult to trade (if you just hodl then cold storage is obviously the best thing to do)

the only reason bch currently has low fees is because no one uses the damn thing. grab a clue

Well if you buy direct from CB you get fucked in fees, deposit, move to GDAX, buy there is the way to go.

It's great to know when to get it, and clearly getting in last night would be worse than this morning, but still frustrating waiting for funds to clear
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:10:10
Yes because they set an arbitrary spot price there. You could have set a stop order below it 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:25

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:23
It's about decentralization, does the higher fees in the current environment suck, yes, will it get fixed, yes.
SegWit and LN will fix a lot of issues
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:46
either way the majority of people who want to take adv of that will sell before the end of the year
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:29
That makes no sense, why would they do that? and if they did do that them getting the BTC for the alt would increase the price slightly and selling would decrease it, coming back to the original price and not making it go down. The only way for it to go down is to trade in btc for alt or usd, 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:19
to add, there was little downward movement post announcement, if people actually cared there would be a big correction. I think the recent moves in price are more towards year end taxes and getting a little more $ together before the holidays
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:32:07
haha, its common sense that the only reason Ver calls it bitcoin cash and now wants to call it bitcoin is because of the massive success that the true bitcoin has had and he wants to take advantage of that. 
If your coin is so great you should rename it Forked Coin and go head to head with BTC instead of relying on BTC marketing to do the heavy lifting for you
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:52:22
You are way overthinking this
My original point is that they are dumping everythhing right now and thats why everything is down, you are going on some roundabout way of doing that dump. Whether or not you pair it with btc or eth or ltc it still backks into a usd price. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:25:15
Because it goes against their plan, they love having all of their FIAT currencies being controlled from the top, but once a decentralized coin is involved and is not part of the "plan" they all freak out
It's a leap i know
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:38
Can you explain this for a layman
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:34:48
Correct, my point is that its more about decentralization than fees at the moment. Also the level of adoption makes the decentralization even stronger for BTC vs other coins which are help by fewer individuals
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:57
when does the tax year end? they have to lock in before end fo 2018 i thought
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:39
Im just selling an avoiding the whole thing, not risking huge losses for a min gain
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:32:03
Oh. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:45:58
fair enough
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:53:01
Yes but that doesn't explain waiting 6 hours between trades, just make the two trades within 5 minuntes and then go to bed and not worry about it
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:55:12
Decentralization, at least to me, is probably the most important part about bitcoin. The scaling will come with time, at it really has already, but BCH isn't decentralized like BTC is
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:51:31
Coinbase can call it whatever they want on their website, most people I talk to call it BCASH but it would be pretty shitty for coinbase to call it bitcoin cash because it would confuse those that are misinformed. 
You can't force anyone to call a coin anything, I am just hoping that coinbase calls it BCash.


Correct, I'm not saying that, I'm saying call it BCash on coinbase, people who want to hold bcash can call it whatever they like
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:38:02
My comment is that it just sucks to wait for funds to get deposited in general, i'd rather buy even yesterday afternoon and now especially this morning, its too tough to time the market in this environment that I would rather get in while I can
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:40
i honestly don't understand how you don't understand this. 
Arbitrage is the reasoning
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:28:34
people are cancelling their limit orders that gdax arbitrarily set
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:53
because when they trade in their alts for btc that lifts the btc price, thats how a market place works. Then when they sell their btc it lowers the price, but if you have people increasing the demand for btc by selling alts and increasing supply by selling btc it lowers the price, therefore btc won't go down as much as the olds
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:29:52
Coinbase better call it BCash instead of Bitcoin Cash
A lot of people are going to be confused and then either make the mistake of sending BCH to the wrong address or purchasing BCH by mistake. 
I understand Ver's point that he wants to return Bitcoin to the original white-paper, but things change and adapt and ignoring the progress of the developers and the market is asinine 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:26:33
LTC has pretty fast transactions so I wouldn't worry 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:33
they weren't allowing market orders, only limit orders
they have screwed up this whole thing
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:47
Isn't trading technically a withdrawal 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:25:22
because of arbitrage, people see a wider gap between currencies and coins they move money around to take advantage of that via different exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:54:37
Supposed or assumed?

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:46
Given all the operational issues they have and withdrawal limits, paying a fee is worth it, IMO.
Does is suck to pay a fee? Of course. But would you rather that or coinbase steal your coins

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:47:38
seems like people are exiting all cryptos, maybe for tax reasons i'm not sure. BCH is getting rekt today so at least thats a positive. Wish I had some more $ to buy this dip, but Hodling for now
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:33:45
If you don't see any confusion there I don't know what to tell you, thats like calling it the euro and the euro cash but they have nothing to do with each other
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:58:11
I am suggesting something, call it bcash, that clearly has been my suggestion all along
Yes the same thing applies to bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond, call it something else like Bgold or Bdiamond. 
It's your coin trying to take advantage of the bitcoin brand that has already been developed. 
Yes so if you don't care which one is the real bitcoin why do you want to defend the bitcoin cash name when it only causes confusion? Bcash would eliminate all confusion. The only reason to call it bitcoin anything is to take advantage of the marketing done by bitcoin and the news. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:49
I set a limit order there so I don't know what you're talking about. I saw the sell wall go from 5MM to 25MM over the course of that hour
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:27:35
It's a meme 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:11:05
how many transactions? all during that period
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:33
thats not true, if that were true then only the alts would go down and the new money created by selling alts would go to btc and support the price
When everything goes down in a day thats people cashing out
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:50:34


So you want people to make mistakes with how they invest their money? Instead of just simply changing the name to Bcash why insist on Bitcoin Cash? It's ridiculous. It so clearly could be fixed, if Bitcoin Cash'ers want to prove that their system is the best they should try and seperate themselves from bitcoin as much as possible 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:12:08
My point is that it will confuse people who intend to buy bitcoin. BCASH is simply an alt-coin just like ripple, or iota, or litecoin. It is very easy to see how someone could be confused and buy BCH when they intend to buy bitcoin. There is a reason Bitfinex has changed the name on their exchange to Bcash. 
People can call it whatever they want, call it 0xkubocash for all i care, but when it could create confusion in the marketplace there should be a distinction. 
Why is Roger afraid of changing the name? Why is he scared of calling it BCash? Who cares what its called if it fundamentaly does what Satoshi wanted? Right? He should want ot call it something else to distance himself from Bitcoin, if he believes that BCash is the best coin out there, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:09:22
wouldnt work
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:15:34
If he is so proud of Bcash why isn't he calling it a different name than Bitcoin cash, isn't that confusing for people? He should want to differentiate if he truly thinks it's better than Bitcoin.
Also Bitcoin didn't fork into two equal blockchains, BCH forked off of BTC to create a new alt coin, the chains aren't equal which Ver tries to say 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:51
ummm expand the graph and see that there are 30 million sell orders at 4330, which is where gdax artificially set the market at
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:11:09
if they sell their alts for BTC, whether or not they use usd as an intermediary, that would support the btc price. Since btc is down 7+% in the last 24 hours that is not the case.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:07:37
Im guessing there are a lot of people who haven't cancelled their fill orders at 4330
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:54:33
I know, but there does need to be a distinction between total investment and 1 transactions
people will now start transaction inh &lt;10,000 usd levels IMO
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:19:36
no sell orders are going through
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:13:09
I'm fine with Charlie's decision and others should be too.  He's not leaving, it his creation, he's has incentive to make it the best possible coin out there, I don't think Charlie is someone who is obsessed with money like roger ver, maybe he's pulling a keyser soze though

Well technically I do own some BCH, I own some USD too does that give me the right to name it whatever I want? No if I called a $1 bill a stanley nickel people would say what thef uck are you talking about. The name of the currency is as much the social contract as anything else. 
Clearly you do care becasue you're getting all bent out of shape on a name change that is meant to differentiate between two distinctly different things. 
Tell me who owns BCH and has the right to rename it? It's so god damn dumb to not see how there could be any confusion. 
Just change the name to BCash and we'll see what coin is standing in 5 years, maybe BCH is the superior coin, maybe it is true to the vision of Satoshi, or maybe its just another alt coin that is trying to take advantage of the Bitcoin name 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:33:19
 Yeah but watching a video of it would be a lot cooler IMO
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:46:55
Ver did that so he could take advantage of the Bitcoin name in marketing, it should be called BCASH so people understand it is not bitcoin that is talked about in the news

GDAX if you're selling a smaller amount, because you get the better price. Problem with gdax is withdrawel limits. It's been a big issue for some, not me but there have been posts here about it
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:08
correct, i'm just giving a reason why people are exiting all right now, every crypto is down so its not just alts going to btc or btc to alts, its alts and btc into fiat, why that is, i dont know. My guess is end of year tax plus all this FUD that has happened because of BCH. 
I'm not saying I'm worried, clearly I wish I had more usd to buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:09:44
Correct but people will do what it takes to avoid taxes. I don't even have that much in crypto to have to worry, just stating what people could do
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:26:48
HAHA no kidding its not trademarked but the brand has clearly developed around the chain. It's not moaning its common sense and people who complain about the bcash name are scared that the their shit alt coin would have no meaning besides the name
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:31:48
plus it reduces the volatility, which in crypto is a good thing
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:44:43
The way I interpreted it was transaction size 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:03
won't allow me to even put on a limit order
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:27
the amount of sell orders compared to buy is about 4-1 so im expecting it to go down. If my sell order doesn't get filled I'll be a tad disappointed, hopefully I can get a market price quick enough

Why would you wait 6 hours between trades? LTC took less than 5 minutes the last time i moved some and BTC orders get filled instantaneously
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:42
Get your coins off GDAX and COINBASE ASAP. There is some really shady shit going on over there. You may get stuck with the withdrawal limits. Crypto is truly the wild west
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:31
BUY BTC wherever, or just Buy LTC instead of BTC,  send LTC to Bittrex, convert to BTC
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:35:15
Use a supply and demand chart from economics, that will help you better understand what is going on and why this move is clearly people just exiting all cryptos. 
BTC is falling
Alt holders don't need to sell in btc but for your example say they do, that would lift the btc price. That is not happening so clearly that is not what is going on
There is no point in dumping alt coins for btc when you can just sell them for usd

@_date: 2018-06-04 18:01:22
thats why its just a theory
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:29:28
My theory is coinbase doesn't actually have the coins that people are holding on their exchange and would have a huge issue if people moved their coins to wallets or trezor/ledger
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:14:41
They aren't mutually exclusive. They are trying to make their platform stable but that means they have to do maintenance to scale. And not any instability, the retail investor who is on coinbase is not going to move their coins because the app isn;t working for a bit. It will take regulation of an exchange like this to prove they are actually holding the deposits

Also there is a withdrawal limit for most people

Because user probably has bought a lot more along the way, and the average price is probably up

While I agree with your first point your second really doesn’t speak to the argument.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:01:16
well there has to be buyers to match those sell orders, I think it won't go down quickly, it really depends on how much demand there is on the buy side

10,000 on gdax, about 15MM usd available for sale at that level
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:29:02
Oh, i mean its constantly buying and selling right, so say i sell you 1 btc for 10k I will take that money and put it in to other coins or I'll just take it and put it into my bank account. There are transaction fees that going to the miners that confirm those transactions, at least that's what I've read. Now those fees are in terms of coins, so they can take that to a marketplace and exchange it for fiat (usd for example) nor they can get the usd then exchange taht for another coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:41:40
well ideally it dips further than current levels, just trying to get a good deal
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:45:03
Really hoping coinbase takes this approach (won't make the mistake of holding coins on an exchange again) so I can just load up on more BTC instead of this pump and dump crap. It's going to be a race Jan 1 for people to sell if coinbase stays true to their current plans
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:46:49
yeah, i like eth and ltc since they are easy to buy on coinbase, i think from here ltc has the biggest upside outside of bitcoin from a transaction standpoinbt. eth is great because different coins are going to be using the ethereum platform to build other coins or applications off of 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:25:16
I'm not talking about bch or ltc or btc, i'm saying there are a lot of instituions like endowment funds, pension funds, etc that have a lot of money and are constantly chasing returns, they care about their today returns, they can add a little risk by investing in funds that take postions in crypto currencies. They will minize their risk by investing in other "safe" investments because they care about the overall return of their pension fund or whatever it is. 
In that regard there is a lot of money on the sidelines
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:07:32
I'll gladly be wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:14

to dump their BCH. I believe that people will be trying to take their gains as soon as possible since they've been locked up for so long and moving that to other cryptos, whether that be btc, eth, or ltc
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:09:27
so the software wallet could be on blockchain.com for example?
Then once it's there and I sold should I generate a new paper wallet for future cold storage?
What level should one invest in a trezor wallet?

it's all relative, are institutions really in the space right now? That i think is the real question

If everyone is holding and not realizing gains then they don't have to report it, that being said I double 799,100 people on coinbase are only holding

Buy orders on the left, sell on the right, basically the amount being transacted on either side, when they matchup up in the middle a transaction gets done. That's how I interpret it anyway

given the struggles of the model 3 1BTC will be worth more than a Tesla by the time Roadsters are available
For reference the roadster should be available sometime 2020 although Tesla was supposed to produce 1500 cars in 3q, only did 260. They have pushed back their 5k cars per week target 3 months, which I think is a little optimistic given their history of over-promising. The cash burn is impressive, and by that I mean I am shocked at how little they get for the money they are currently spending

essentially you can move it without the tax implications because the irs doesn't know whats going on, im just trying to hold, hell i have less than a btc so you would only have to pay taxes on dividends (aren't any) or gains when you sell
They maintain the value based on a few things, cheap transations, finite amount etc.

This is key, everyone is going to be dumpiong BCH when available, at least everyone I've talked with. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:23:52
Why? because people don't like BCH? I would rather deal with ETH or LTC than BCH for cheap transactions. Maybe **you're** the one in the echo chamber

Everybody what to what moneytary expense? And will they even know when or how to sell if they want to. Who said anything about being a contrarian? I'm just saying there is a lot of money on the sidelines. 
Say everyone you know is in for $100 each, well if different insitutions get involved that total amount of money is going to skyrocket.  
We aren't in 2014 levels but I would hardly call it a crowded trade.

Yes, then why is he calling it the true bitcoin instead of Bcash? Its disingenuous. He is attempting to take advantage of the brand of bitcoin, if he was so confident he would've just created his own coin and not named it anything to do with bitcoin. 
I'm not going to argue about this all day, those are my views
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:28:37
Bch supporters and ver especially are trying to say that bch is bitcoin, which it obviously is not. That's the whole argument

How many bitcoin nodes are there currently? How is that auditable ?

Listen to the conf call/presentation. Ignore the disorganization and focus on the products they are creating. Then make a judgement call. Easy to disparage his actions from the sidelines
Also this isn’t new news, they announced this on the conf call

I saw that, to be frank I'm surprised the number isn't a lot higher...

what price is that at? a lot of those sell walls are spoofed by either the exchange or whales, the sell wall will go away before the sale is hit

Of course you're right but get downvoted to hell

buy a shit-ton of BTC, people get liquidated, sell that BTC. You net the same on the trade but you make the money on liquidating the bigger whale who was trading on margin

This is such a overused quote. You know in the movie the internship with owen wilson and vince vaughn there is a dickhead guy on the other team. There is also a fat guy on that team. The dickhead says "so fat, so fat" to the fat guy with so much disdain which can only be replicated by my hatred for this dumb fucking quote
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:07:42
yes but that is almost a bullish sign to me, that won't be able to last in the long term. Who cares what the short term price is, i'd rather a lower price to give me more opportunity to buy low
