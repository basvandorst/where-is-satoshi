I posted it on but they don't seem to be interested. And I can't post it here because it's technically an altcoin. (Even though it's a shitpost that revolves around missing bitcoins)

Thanks for the inspiration to make this idea!
Shitcoin is a virtual currency issued by Shitcoin. Inc. It has no value in itself but early Shitcoin investors may earn up to 4x their initial investment. Allow me to explain. Shitcoin.Inc has purchased the Landfill site where a wallet worth approximately $24 million in Bitcoin is located. With the help of James Howell (The man who lost his bitcoins in his landfill) and ShitCoin investors, we will attempt to find the wallet. Once the wallet is found, a snapshot of the Shitcoin network will be taken. The bitcoins recovered will be distributed among Shitcoin holders at a rate of 1 BTC/ 10,000 SHIT. (Yes, that is the ticker symbol for ShitCoin.) 
There will be a total of 75,000,000 Shitcoins created. This is to reflect the number of Bitcoins in the lost wallet. The Shitcoins will be distributed as stated below:
10,000,000 Shitcoins to the original owner. He will **not** own the private key to his Shitcoins to prevent him from cashing out early. According to our contract, he will receive 1,000 bitcoins after the hard drive is recovered and decrypted. 
20,000,000 Shitcoins for the ICO. Buying a landfill is surprisingly expensive. We also have to buy the equipment to search through the massive amount of waste.  Shitcoins will be issued at a rate of 40,000 SHIT/1 BTC during this ICO, so stock up on those early Shitcoins. This will be the cheapest they’ll ever be. 
40,000,000 Shitcoins for Shitcoin Miners. This will be explained below in the Shitcoin mining section.
5,000,000 Shitcoins for Shitcoin Inc. Like the Shitcoins allocated to the original owner, these will **NOT** be moved. As the company who is taking the biggest risk in this, we would like to hold these tokens for ourselves and once the wallet is recovered, we will take a 500 BTC cut. (Less than a 7% cut)
 Mining
Unlike cryptocurrencies, Shitcoin is not mined. It is a virtual asset but **NOT** a cryptocurrency. But yet it can still be mined. How?
There will only be one Shitcoin mining pool, the Shitcoin Inc. mining pool. In the Shitcoin network, there will only be 1 block to be mined: The hard drive containing the wallet. So how will the miners get paid?
Cryptocurrencies often use hashpower to mine their currency. We use trashpower. Shitcoin miners will be contributing to the Shitcoin network by investing their own money, and will be receiving Shitcoin at a rate of 15,000 SHIT / BTC. The BTC they invest will be used to pay for our “miners”, the people who are working through the landfill to try and retrieve the hard drive. There will be no difficulty increase, and the 15,000 SHIT / BTC invested will remain constant.  But why would people invest their bitcoin for a meager 1.5x ROI (in terms of btc) in potentially several years?
1.	Forced Hodl: This will prevent people who jump at every opportunity from losing their money.
2.	Shitcoin Miners will also be paid in whatever other valuables are found for the day in USD. 
For example: The Shitcoin mining network has a trash rate of 100,000 SHIT / Day. We find a diamond necklace valued at $100,000 while searching for the hard drive. Every miner is eligible to claim 1 USD for every Shitcoin they bought that day. 
 the Wallet
According to our experts, the chances that the hard drive was destroyed was under 0.5%. This makes Shitcoin a low risk investment, although it might be slow. We will have a website where you can view the current trashpower of Shitcoin for that day and our progress on searching through the whole landfill. Due to information that was generously provided by the original owner as to where he lost the hard drive, we think that it is highly probable that we will find the missing Bitcoins within the first 10% of the landfill. If the Shitcoin mission ends early, we reserve the right to claim the remaining Bitcoins for ourselves. However, all investors will receive at least 1.5X their initial investment, so it’s a win-win situation for everyone.
 of Shitcoin
There is no guarantee that Shitcoin will be worth anything now or in the future. Once the missing bitcoins are found and distributed, it is expected that their value will plummet to 0 as they are worth nothing anymore. If the hard drive is not found, nobody who invested in Shitcoins will receive anything. Please acknowledge the risks that come with investing in Shitcoin before purchasing. 
 obtained from the wallet.
Bitcoin Cash will **NOT** be distributed to holders of Shitcoin. This decision is not political, it is simply based off of the fact that we want to keep the bitcoin cash for ourselves.
By the way, this idea isn't real, just a shitpost. (In case you couldn't tell, never know with those ICOs)

I'm going to ignore my previous statement since your comment is completely neutral. As much as I wish that can happen, I sense that it wouldn't. It feels like the rivalry already erupted to a place of no return, sadly as it may be.

As a fellow New Yorker, I agree. The worst part is that one of the only companies to be granted a Bitlicense and the one I used to use (Circle) doesn't even support Bitcoin anymore.

I actually created the subreddit a day or so ago impulsively. As a subscriber of both subreddits, I'm tired of the insults and jabs being thrown at each other. I plan to hodl my miniscule .1 btc on both chains.
