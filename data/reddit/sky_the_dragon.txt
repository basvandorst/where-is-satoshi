I know this post is a joke, but my local gold/silver shop actually sells bullion with the bitcoin logo on it. Looks really similar to this.

Oh god, don’t do that... On the weekly charts it’s way over-bought on the RSI. It’s gonna move alright, but probably not the way you want it to.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m bullish on BTC in the long term, but it needs a healthy pullback to sustain this growth.

The BTC.com hot wallet supports segwit. And ironically their wallet also supports Bitcoin Cash.

A lot of exchanges don’t recognize bc1 addresses as valid for withdrawals. Cash App being one of them. That’s the main reason I mostly use 3 addresses right now.

But it doesn’t suck. And my only other option for a quick fiat gateway is Coinbase.
Plus my favorite wallets don’t even use bc1 addresses yet.

I know right... I have that awkward conversation with people on an almost daily basis.
Which brings me to my next point...
If a colorblind crypto enthusiast can’t tell the difference between logos, it’s time to rebrand.
Mass adoption wont come until dumb, colorblind, average Joe in a hurry can tell the difference. We all think the tech and financial sovereignty alone  will bring that, but there’s far more to it.

Crypto enthusiasts: “Why is Ethereum on there? That’s not even considered an altcoin anymore.”
Everyone else; “Wtf is etha-rum? And why is he buying those weird stickers with his bitcoins?”

Shut up, I’m colorblind... seriously. Lol

Technically, no.
But before crypto came along, no one ever had to create a law that specifically addressed something like this (as far as I’m aware). So I think it’s officially a legal grey area.
I mean how is the IRS supposed to know the difference between you sending to a private wallet that you own or a wallet owned by someone you’re purchasing goods from? They can make educated guesses by examining the blockchain, but that still doesn’t tell them who owns what 100% of the time. It just shows them the flow of satoshis from one address to another.
Also, another complicated legal matter that varies by location is trading directly from crypto to crypto, with no fiat involved. There isn’t an equivalent in the traditional stock markets for which the laws were written. For example if you have Apple stock and want to trade it for Microsoft stock, you’d actually sell the Apple stock for fiat (a taxable event), then buy Microsoft stock with that fiat. In crypto, you can go straight from BTC to ETH without touching fiat at all and the USD-equivalent price for both can fluctuate wildly mid-transaction on top of that.
So yeah, crypto taxes are a clusterf*ck.

They probably use an app to generate payment requests for each customer, and this framed QR is mostly for show and/or tips. Also if they take the payment right when they order, it would most likely be confirmed at least once by the time they’re done eating. At least for now while the mempool isn’t jam packed like it was a year ago...
