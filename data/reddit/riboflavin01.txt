If mixed properly, yes, the coins themselves would be difficult to tie back to you. Keep in mind that there are other layers involved such as the security and privacy of the mobile wallet, how the coins are spent (or more specifically how change addresses will be generated and used), address reuse, the receivers ability to tie you back to the coins etc.

It will come, give it time. Fee is a little low, and a block hasn't been found in almost an hour: 
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:50:24
Who says they didn’t?
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:57:59
BRD, until Green supports receiving to native Segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:02:46
This should give you a good indicator of current fees vs transaction backlog:  keep in mind this changes a good amount during the course of the day based on transaction volume and blocks found etc.
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:50:43
Coinbase does a pretty good job of this: 
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:12:26
0.624 sat/B
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:57:14
I believe they improved the automatic fee generation in one of the more recent releases. Apparently its a somewhat complicated thing to get right.
That fee is pretty low, but you might have some luck if you run it through the transaction accelerator (when it isn't full): 
@_date: 2017-04-24 23:32:26
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:18:04
It isn't open source.
It is and it isn't important. As he says, the key generation is done on the front end.
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:06:35
He is implying it’s okay to sell some now, but set a stop loss ahead of time so that if the price climbs to a certain point you buy back in. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 04:58:20
I’m not sure I fully understand your question, but in general miners choose to confirm higher fee transactions first. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:55:46
Apparently its this: 
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:09:01


Why? That is theft. If you don't want to return the BTC then you should speak to your bank as luke-jr mentioned. If you don't want to pay for them then you should contact Coinbase about the error and give them back the BTC you never paid for.

I believe you can choose between both of those options. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:56:28
How many confirmations does your BTC transaction have?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:10:41
Essentially they try to jam your transaction into the next possible block. Its not guaranteed but I've had some luck with it speeding up slow transactions in the past.
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:20:40
@_date: 2019-04-04 04:55:01
Probably just a bait post, but if you are serious then yes there is a lot of traffic on the main chain right now. If you’d like to push your transaction through faster I’d recommend RBF. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:14:07
The two outputs you are referring to are called [change addresses](
I'm not familiar with their site so I don't know if they takes fees, I'm sure you could find out somewhere in their TOS or by contacting them. Keep in mind there are also Bitcoin network fees. Can you link to your transaction? How much did you get vs what you were expecting to get?
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:15:04
You do what you'd like, but that is still theft. If a bank accidentally deposits money into your account would you keep it?
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:31:12
Probably Coinbase with a credit card.

No, wallet B-&gt;wallet C has nothing to do with wallet A at that point.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:16:56
Thanks for the response. I think the best solution would be to default to bech32 with the option to generate non-native Segwit addresses if desired rather than wait for the entire ecosystem to be compatible. This is the solution BRD and others have used. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:05:08
BRD wallet is 1%
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:48:45
Don't blame Electrum, you get to choose the fee.
Post your transaction ID.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:42:27
No, are you going to read through every commit in some open source repo before using the site?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:59:22
The average time should be 60 minutes, 1 block every 10 minutes. He just got unlucky.
99% of the time you see an empty block like that it is because there was another block found seconds before. In the case of OP's screenshot he cut off the block found 16 seconds before the one he highlighted.

Implementing SegWit would have no effect on transaction volume.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:06:55
How is that?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:12:54
10 minute blocks are intentional, a compromise between security and convenience. Short block time can cause all sorts of issues, some of the biggest being wasted hashpower, unintentional forks and longer reorg times.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:35:06
I don't see it as a difficulty issue, short block times cause more orphaned blocks. It is more of a networking issue than anything else. When I mentioned wasted hash power I meant being wasted on invalid chains from orphaned blocks.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:40:50
I doubt anyone running on mainnet would be surprised if they lost funds, it is stated in many places along the way of setting up a node that it is a possibility.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:23:09
You don't need to do anything, segwit won't affect your coins.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:32:51
Correct, it is a phrase (series of words) that will allow you (or anyone that got access to it) to restore your wallet and all the addresses ever used inside it from scratch giving full spending access to your BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:59:21
More network capacity would hopefully help with the massive transaction backlog. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:18:26
Did you implement yourself or is that a library?
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:27:14
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:54:49
There are lots of safe and convenient ways to store your BTC. If you'd like to go the paper wallet route that is one option. If you generate the wallet in a secure environment (live CD, offline, etc) this is probably one of the safest ways to store BTC, but also slightly inconvenient. You read correctly that if done improperly, a paper wallet can result in 'lost coins' due to the way change addresses are handled. To prevent this, when importing your paper wallet you should use a wallet that can 'sweep' the entire balance at once - most modern wallets have this ability.
In my personal opinion, which isn't worth much, I'd recommend you use something like [Copay]( for a balance of security and ease of use. Copay will let you generate a seed/backup phrase that can be used to regenerate/restore you wallet at any time. So you can install Copay on your computer, phone, etc using this phrase and have access to all your BTC anywhere. Your private keys are only stored on your devices not Copay servers so its much safer than using a web wallet. If you are storing large amounts of BTC and are worried about keeping them on your computer, phone, etc then I would recommend a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:48:47
Could be spam, could be legitimate.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:17:48
I believe the transaction will clear the mempool 72 hours after it was created if still unconfirmed (and then return to your wallet).
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:51:56
But you can buy one right here for .05btc 
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:36:19
Less than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:26:55
Do a little more reading on bitcoin before you purchase. Also keep in mind its not like a dollar bill, you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin you can but a tiny fraction of one.
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:04:31
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:15:55
Oh then I'm not really sure, my account is older than that.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:27:39
Not really, just write down your backup phrase when you create the wallet and keep it somewhere safe (or multiple places). If something ever happens you can use that to generate the wallet again and get access to your BTC. As you mentioned earlier the biggest risk would be something user-security related like malware.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:25:10
Who knows, you would have to ask them. If I took a guess, it would be for tax purposes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:03:29
Thought I was on for a second
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:09:25
Correct, Copay is just a wallet to store your coins in. You could purchase coins using an exchange like Gemini, Coinbase, Localbitcoins etc. and then send them to an address generated by your Copay wallet for safe keeping.
In your example, you would send USD from your bank to the exchange and then buy BTC on the exchange with your USD.
edit: Don't forget to write down your seed/recovery phrase from Copay and keep it somewhere safe.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:19:31
Exactly, they have wallet functionality built in but I wouldn't use that for long term storage since if the website disappears overnight so would your coins. The web wallet should really just be used while you are buying/selling/trading online, transfer to something like Copay for holding purposes. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:02:15

LocalBitcoins? Or get your Coinbase limit increased
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:44:08
They aren't reading live from the blockchain each time you request a page. The relevant info is scanned from the chain once and then stored in a local database on the web server, and cached for fast viewing.
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:56:30
Fee wise it will be much cheaper to do it all at once, then you are only paying one fee. In terms of safety, I'm guessing you mean privacy, and that was pretty much gone when the coins touched Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:28:12

Yeah, then he might lose his btc...
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:32:00
I'm pretty sure Coinbase consolidates transactions to avoid that. Just because you have 100 inputs on your Coinbase account doesn't necessarily mean you will have 100 inputs on a transaction clearing out your Coinbase account to another wallet. Or at least that has been my experience.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:18:43
