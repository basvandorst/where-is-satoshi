Awesome, thank you for doing that! I've only entered myself into the CoinMap database and hadn't researched others yet.

I ship USPS Priority and I haven't had any problem shipping in 100 degree whether for the two days it takes for me to ship to Texas. East coast is 3 days, but I think with the weather a bit cooler now you will be fine. I ship with insulation and several ice packs. Last thing I want is for you to receive a product of mine that I wouldn't be happy with, so this is my honest opinion. I ferment my sauerkraut for about 6 weeks so I don't think 3 days is going to be problem. Other experts please feel free to chime in!

Working on fixing this ASAP. Thanks for the patience–I sent you a PM if you want to pay directly to the address provided to keep your order moving along but I will notify you once the website functionality is working as it should.
Edit: Bitcoin checkout is fixed. I just had to update the plugin I was using. Thanks...

To anyone interested, we accept bitcoin on the website as well, it's just not currently apparent until you go to check out. Let me know if you have any questions.

The sauerkraut I make undergoes the same style of fermentation as kimchi, yes.
