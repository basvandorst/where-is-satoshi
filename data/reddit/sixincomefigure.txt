Well, that's how I'd describe everyone who buys bitcoins, but I'm trying to give the people who lost their money the benefit of the doubt.

Bitcoin was still worth a couple of hundred bucks tops in November 2013. In December 2013 it skyrocketed to $1200. To quote a guy in the linked article:


Assuming this guy had about 60 coins, he went from having $12k to $70k worth of BTC in just a couple of weeks. $12k is still a lot of money, sure, but imagine that he bought it when it was just a couple of bucks a coin and didn't pay a lot of attention to the week-to-week movements after that. He attempted to withdraw it as soon as it became worth a *lot* of money, but by December Gox was already refusing withdrawals.
You do a lot of people a disservice to imply that they consciously and deliberately kept "hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin" in an exchange. By the time they became worth that vast sum, it was already almost impossible to withdraw them.

Seeing there's just about nothing you can do with BTC except exchange them for USD at fortuitous times to try and make a profit, I think people leaving them on an exchange is entirely understandable. People don't uplift their entire investment portfolio from their broker every time they make a transaction.
Was it dumb? Certainly. But no dumber than buying BTC in the first place.

Shame he has zero understanding of science.

Buying and spending some bitcoins "to test whether a kid can do it" is about as far away from science as it's possible to get. What he's done is some very basic investigative journalism that would be appropriate for an economics or journalism class. It's not a science experiment or project in any meaning of the word.
Is this your kid? Don't take it personally, I'm sure he worked very hard on this and was very excited by it. Good for him but that doesn't magically make it something it's not.

You can't live in a bitcoin timmy
