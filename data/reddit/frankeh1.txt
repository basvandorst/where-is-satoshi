I scheduled the skype and they flaked out on that too. Even tough I selected daylight savings time they called an hour late and i missed it.
I tried calling calling back 5 times in 15 mins with no answer. In the end i left a video message flashing the BPAY receipt, license and bank card.
About an hour later by BTC was sent.
So I did get my money in the end but i will never recommend them as the week and a half surprise hold ups cost me a lot in exchange rates and non of this was made clear until it happened. 
I've seen reports IGOT got hacked so I'm guessing there running a ponzi scheme paying out withdrawals with new deposits. thats why there so deceptive about it.

I live in semi rural Australia, finding local bitcoins is impossible. 
Igots practices are down right deceptive.

Might be best to pull out 0.05 BTC a day to fly under the radar and not get all your coins frozen like me until you hand over your soul.

If they are concerned the deposit is fraudulent why isn't it held as it comes in? before you use the funds to buy btc off someone else.
If it was a fraudulent deposit how do they expect to get it back after i've already bought BTC off someone else and they have ran off with the cash?

It won't.
even after getting a level 2 verification you will be greeted with this when you try and withdraw any BTC or cash.
Option 1:
1. You will need to ask your bank to verify your recent BPAY payment to us. They will need to give a letter stating the amount, date, and other details of this BPAY.
2. Get your Government issued Photo ID and Bank Statement (from where you sent us BPAY) attested by your Bank or Justice of Peace as 'True Copy'.
Once you do that, you will need to mail it to us at:
13th Pty Ltd,
P.O BOX 628, Oaklands Park
SA 5046
Once we receive the stamped true copy, we will lift the restrictions on your account for completely.
This is strictly to protect igot from Banking, BPAY and Direct Debit frauds and cannot be waived.
Option 2:
Schedule a video call with us.
We will require you to verify the following during the call:
    Your photo id
    BPAY payment receipt
    Front and Back of your Debit or Credit card where the BPAY was sent from
**THE FRONT AND BACK OF YOUR CREDIT CARD. FULL NUMBER AND PPIN** sounds like fraud/identity theft waiting to happen.

just stay away from igot altogether

It's a bait and switch scam
They change the rules after they have your money making it harder to withdraw in the hope you give up.

Read my other replys. Account was level 2 (the highest) verified before any deposits were made.
Would you be happy if your bank kept all your money because one line in a 100,000 page contract said they could if they felt like it?
 
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:29:21
All the complaints are the same. Surprise verifications.
If Igot just made a level 3 verification and explained the process before taking peoples money you might have a half decent exchange.  
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:41:07
You keep saying Igot has prevented millions of dollars in fraud. Is this all the money people have abandoned after you surprise them with the extra verification?
@_date: 2015-03-27 06:41:32
That really sucks dude. Unfortunately I don't know how i could help as it looks like you have tried everything except for knock on there door. 
Maybe start a new discussion on this and other bitcoin subreddits for more exposure. As you can see this topic is 3 months old and has 0 upvotes despite all the discussion here.
It's almost like some one/group is trying to hide it.

thats the guy who's attention you need to get. 
you're not the only one having problems
