Well , the times are changing . The next crisis will be certainly debt based and will affect the sovereignty of the States even. How many options asset managers have , to protect the cash against the crash ? I don't see too many options for the current situation .
- Tresors / gov. bonds - only valid option if the government are not falling apart . 
- real estate ? Not really , no no 
- defensive stocks - good option to cover part of the funds 
- gold : good only if we still trade the paper gold which now is under heavy criticism and may not be on the table for too long 
- maybe you know where they can put it other than in crypto ?

No I agree but the media outlet is that Korea and regulations drive the ccryptos down. But I don't see for now anything bad in those regulations that are even good as they will bring some institutional investors but yet the market is down.

I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending," Buffett told CNBC .
Mr Buffett your B.H. business will come to a bad ending if you do not invest a portion in cryptos (unless already done) . The reason being is that you have no way to escape the next market crash . It's coming . Having dozens of billions in stocks now in 2018 it's a suicide mission . The markets are all time high , the future is uncertain especially for the USD. If there is no exposure to BTC and other leading cryptos , it's almost certain you take a huge risk with the stock investment alone  . When the time will come to cut losses and sell them, against what you gonna trade your stocks ? The USD ? Well what if the USD start to drop too ? The gold ?  Bitcoin and similar can really insure you protection against USD's devaluation which will drag other currencies also down. To be of the level of Buffett and make such a statement it's not conceivable for me .

This is what I'd call optimistic waves . This is the confidence in the market that million of people/millionaires now have, nothing can stop them to buy more and the best part of it that you know it , haha ). We talk about cheap market now when BTC is at 10k and one Ether almost at 1k and even some alts that jumped already 100x are seen as a bargain, crazy no ?

Guys this has nothing to do with any corruption . If you want to understand better the Russian situation you need to learn what means SWIFT for Russia and the BRICs countries in general. Don't get it straight that any of those countries including China and Russia are against the cryptos . All the opposite believe me. They are hostages of the US led SWIFT system and the cryptos are one of the few options at this stage to escape it but they are not ready for gov and corporate investment and many countries are doing politics to play it safe not to destroy the balance/partnerships with the SWIFT countries . They all now sooner or later the digital age will prevail but this will be smooth transition, in my view the years of the fiat are really numbered. I personally forecast another credit-crunch like crisis . I think it will happen in the next couple of years before Trump's end of mandate and this will break once and for all the faith in the fiat money. Then the digital age will fully begin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:53:45

From what I understood the lightning is not coming without any cost . There will be third parties to manage the lightning and many issue regarding the implementation as it is not that easy to setup the system. The other point is the monopoly of the fees. Why to say "no" to billion of $$$ taken for BTC payments ?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:28:09
I don't get why the market goes down ? I mean it was time to bring some regulations in this market indeed but no one said will be ban the cryptos , yet the market goes down ? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:09:14
The technology is here but who wants to implement it ? The gov ? I don't think they will let it happen . A trillion $ market  cap will be still OK but to see trillions of $£E dumped for BTC just because it works better for the consumers, there is no how the G8 let this happen . Also, one major roadblock are the BTC fees . While for us they are a pain for others they a gold mine . So in this drama the people in power do not probably want to see the lightning network On . I expect to see this market growing on the way it was growing till now for another 4-5 years and at some point in the future hopefully something will move but not now. Meanwhile altcoins with better features will probably continue to animate the scene and make some new millionaires .
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:36:33
Well we have some that been here for while but right now are very low. I don't want to advertise any but today it's really the time to say don't trust the pricing of the alts. 3 things :
- ICOs, especially the ones after the first altseason in 2017 and the nextbitcoin dreamer projects - all crap. Nothing or little will survive there, let alone growth 
- cryptocurrency , peer to peer coins especially those that were created before 2017 altseason.
For me after the March-May 2017 surge, many came to make some money and scam out the investors. The serious projects were those that didn't see 100x surge and were raised mainly before June 2017. When I check them, even though some are at 5 mln cap, there is tech-support, development, community , basically it's not a scam for sure and they are fully operational after 3,4 years of existence right Today. They will survive everything, the ICOs wont. 
-  With payment systems live Visa integration, many old and trustful projects will become very useful. Imagine now on coinbase you can buy plenty of coins and make a payment with all of them through a visa card. From that perspective  BTC=ALT. How to expect based on such developments for Bitcoin to get to 80% dominance and keep that position for at least 1 year? I am telling you mate, as soon as we get closer to 25-35k for BTC the inversion will start to accelerate from BTC to alts. If not then, this will be a big miss out for the traders and hedge funds. Be ready to be everywhere but BTC naturally should be the favourite for all of us .
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:45:19
Well done ! This is how everybody should be doing . Unfortunately some take crazy risks plus they put all theirs eggs in one basket. You should invest in a way that even if the market goes to 0$ the next day you are still fresh and able to go back to normal otherwise it's not even fun to be in this boat even when it goes up. this is at least my view. 
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:40:28
it may be that we are witnessing the next mega crash. 
First ATH 20k and boom down to 3k
Second ATH 13.5k and boom down to maybe 1,2 k
In this case this would have been the biggest bulltrap ever, but also possible. We never know. Guess what I lot of the surge was due as well to Tether. You remove that one plenty of money will go away . So yes, is it possible , absolutely.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:20:32
You are wrong , you can't predict what Facebook or Google will do in the future with the alts. It may well be that they don't integrate Bitcoin into anything but they do so with other coins from top 100. Look at Samsung 10, like Ether but Not BTC. You don't decide the utility . The delusion that people will decide that  is a total delusion. If a big bank or company like Amazon integrate  another coin, or even Facebook, your Bitcoin will have hard times ahead. So no, the past does not indicate the future in this case.
Sorry if I break you american dream but BTC Dominance: 100% in all logic should never happen!
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:57:56
I think you slightly misunderstood . To have mainstream adoption the government needs  to endorse that somehow. Even if you bring the best technology which makes BTC +10000 transactions per second and free, you cannot expect for now this to be adopted . The States won't allow that to happen because it will threaten the entire financial system / control and powers they have. Also who gets paid with those BTC transactions fees ? Those guys won't be happy with BTC a 0.1$/per transaction  let alone cheaper .

No. Literally 1000s of houses and flats in US were abandoned and are still derelict since the credit crunch of 2008-2010. Where is the intrinsic value of those flats to save out the owners? Many of those real estates assets with so called intrinsic value were built literally couple before the crunch, and left empty in 2010. Those areas are not empty, nobody wants to live there, so **the real estate Has  No intrinsic value** either from that perspective or , or all asset has some in one shape or form, which i believe is a better explanation.

Guess how many bought when it was 3.5k? Not many otherwise the prices would have surged, instead we assisted for weeks to a price range of btw 3k-4k
It's very difficult to go against the stream. When the marking is crashing the usual reaction is to stay away, when it goes up, the buyers buy and the sellers buy and the hodlers buy. So nope, 1k Bitcoin, I am not sure if I will buy one, why , because 1k Bitcoin it's shit lots of buts and ifs.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:07:54
You keep going to the same point. Why do you think it's impossible to see alongside of Libra anther coin? Yesterday i was reading an excited guy who was saying BTC will be an option on Facebook. Well yes but what about another coin. The way I am seeing now, Bitcoin will be integrated into Facebook sooner than Libra. Have you seen what's going on in Europe and China - total allergy to Libra. Worse case they can even integrate xrp to insure there is a company behind. Anyways I don't see the way you see it. Bitcoin can well become 2nd. Just remember in the history how many times the humanity witness the impossible. For me to see BTC 2nd won't be a big deal.

I just found this old article, another prediction to the rise of the crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:26:29
they are not really missing scarcity, yes and no i would say. It's just at some point somewhere that asset lost value, simple as that. There is plenty of homeless people in US but what happened, is that there was some areas where 100% were built and sold as part of the credit crunch scheme. When crisis hit and entire neighbourhood of   100 houses was affected. The few that wanted to stay and live there had to live because of became a gang hub. So at first there was plenty of scarcity for that area, but then it's gone. It's like in your state BTC is banned in Malta it's thriving. Scarcity when and how. There is plenty if buts and if, my position still stand - the intrinsic value is there in one way or another. That one is not the right problem around BTC.

We need free and speedy transfer but the BTC guys don't need that. They are very happy of the way the things go up and none will change something that works for them regardless of how much it does not work for you. So the lightning is not for tomorrow folks

Another bullshit post ready to downgrade. In your world we should believe what the dogs say right? The truth does not hurt especially when it's coming from a bark first. It's Bitcoin season now like back in July-Oct 2017 and I am totally advocate of Bitcoin but at some point Bitcoin will weight too priced and the most under-valuated assets there will be the alts. Guess what will happen and it will happen when everybody are confident about Bitcoin and fearful about altcoins.  You can't predict the market anyways so enjoy your moment of happiness but it's almost certain that we should assist to the altcoin surge when Bitcoin reaches the top again .

Guys, the new story about the lighting network is that it will make the Altcoins worthless as BTC will become faster and the fee will drop . What are your thoughts about it ? Do you really believe it will happen ? Should we expect BTC to gain back like 90% dominance ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:28:44
We should also consider that around 10% are lost //sent to wrong addressee, lost wallet, etc... hence the number in circulation should be around 15 mln maybe
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:26:13
Ok, read you comment but why exactly should people keep all in BTC ? What tells you that for sure BTC will stay on top and I am not talking about any speculation but factual is that excluding BTC we have now 155 bln with Altcoin . The entire globe diversify the assets to avoid risks . All the schools teach diversification in the long term investment , you are saying "intelligent approach" keep it all in BTC ? I still don't see why not to have a bit of everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:52:52
We never know the future. This is maybe the right time to diversify? I am just asking myself the question what's the benefits of putting all eggs in one basket ? Now Iota is on+25% , NEM +100% , LTC at 165 USD and more that can be purchased with the BTC at 16k . Isn't it the right time ?

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:49:11
This  can be due to some big players who don't put theirs BTC on the market while the retails wealthy individuals/buyers are growing in panic rising the price. Yes the volume is very high but we have now Asia America , the globe basically trying to buy BTC. You can do it much easier than for any other coin and hence the huge retail buying force drive the numbers up and because there is no enough coins to keep the market stable and  good news/futures, lightning etc coming soon it goes to the moon but no panic , on the moment the big ones drop theirs BTC you will see the correction and billions flying in the hands of maybe new billionaires / we'll hear about them later.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:02:25
I got your point . I wouldn't go that far to say worthless though as many made millions with the some coins are delivering value (master-nodes, regular grow or simply quicker and cheaper transaction .

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:10
OK, I got your point but imagine the situation where for instance Iota or another player sign an agreement with a big name. We should also consider the possibility of another maybe not BTC but Ether like coin. Lisk are working with Google . Do you imagine what will happen tomorrow if you suddenly sport the logo Lisk on you google search ? BTC stand there no chance hence I have to disagree with you that is all or nothing and we saw already BTC dropping to 37% dominance . How you can say after that the diversification is not diversification when many made millions from that. Many altcoins raised by x50 or even x100 time since Feb this year while BTC got just x15. So my question still stand firm . How wise is to let the top 100 aside and run after one BTC and all the readers here including myself happy to take on-board a valid feedback but to say all or nothing? , we already saw BTC loosing market share and this can happen again. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:42:21
I'd suggest not to look what happened in the past too much cos each time has its rules. Now it will be very difficult for BTC to rally 50x like it did btw 2015 - 2018. Few reasons for that :
1.	Much more cash needs to be injected into BTC. I am not mathematical but 50x 5k = 250k / BTC x 17mln coins = 4.250 bln $ of the BTC cap.
2.	BTC Is limited but plenty of other coins that do the same are not. You’ll see some projects growing to the next 100 bln cap in 1-2 years as well
There is this saying even a Baobab stops growing . While I do agree that BTC has the potential to grow yet 10-20 times , I find it unlikely to see BTC at 250k for the reasons above. Apple’s share won’t got to 10 trillion cap, the same way the real estate is in stagnation state in Europe since around 2000. I can think of 1 case scenario only when BTC can quick go to even 1mln. It’s the dollar and EUR collapse . In that case I see little choice left except BTC and crypto in general and we may see injection of 100bln $ into crypto. Then yes as people will have no other choice. Is not going to be buy for 1$ to sell 10$ but buy not to lose your 1$, but I don’t see another scenario .

Yet another indication that dollar backed stable-coins have little future . Things that have a decided price have little value in the crypto world. The organic price is what people would accept to pay based on the offer and demand. There will be volatility yes but not that much as soon as BTC hits +100k. The higher the price of the BTC the lower would be the volatility to the point we assist to stable coin that's backed by an organic price not a dollar fund hold in the Bank.

What makes me laugh is that most of the people here came and bought Bitcoin thinking that they were super smart and they found the gold mine while the 35mln millionaires we count globally were stupid  as they didn't buy it. If it was that easy, every millionaire would have bought now at least 1 BTC and there wouldn't be enough BTC to cover 35mln people even . What you are seeing is that nobody gives a damn about Bitcoin this is why the prices are sliding , there is no enough demand. At least for now! Does it make Bitcoin a bad investment.  Just recall the trust crisis from 2002, the credit crunch from 2009. Everyone who bought back then are now the golden boys, everyone who bought before were crying for few years.

Ok, I am happy to play the kind teacher for a minute. The problem is that when you follow the prices on coinmarketcap you find just around the corner this trend which says don't discuss prices, my answer to the organisers, I see no valid logic whatsoever in this decision! If it was another type of website, I would agree, but you don't integrate  r/Bitcoin  with coinmarketcap and then say, go Daily Discussion thread, the chatroom, or r/BitcoinMarkets = nonsense!
Every single trading platform that comes with news, allow discussions around pricing, not only allow but encourage, here you see the world in the opposite, not the users but r/Bitcoin **needs to get out of this integration with coinmarketcap.** I hope you know what means coinmarketcap or you don't have clue? **Coin market cap = reference to the prices**. So what are you saying now?
If you want to do something rational just make sure when we click next time on social, we don't find r/Bitcoin **or remove your post and change your rules to connect with the reality ))**

No probs, by the way , it's the entire system now that run or more quantitative that qualitative . Same for the companies. It will be much easier for them to find someone who speaks both perfect, the English and another key language.  But no, instead they will find someone like me who speaks few languages with a bit lesser quality but can do the job.  Then they will overload him with plenty of work and save money . This is even more pronounced strangely in big companies where the budget normally should be a bit less of a hassle and yet in my experience this is where we have less focus on the quality . Anyways, everyone try to cope the way they can ))

Haha, I don't want to share a lot about me here but I am fluent in 5 languages and I am using them every day. I am exec for a multinational and what you are saying, well you are not the only one \[true\] but I can't improve my English Now. 1st no much time for that given my job, 2nd what about my other languages . I need to have good level in all of them as I have customers partners and colleagues with whom I need to use those languages but I will never be perfect in all of them. What you are saying will be very difficult to achieve for someone that speak over 2 languages. Now, if one day we get to the "moon, lambo" then yes, I won't be buying lambo but I will go to one of the top MBA schools and I will definitely improve my English .

You just depicted the harsh reality. For many to by decent flat it's an impossible dream. The worse is the mortgage market. Asking people to buy a flat for 30 years it's like asking them to keep the same job for 30 years. This won't happen in 90% of cases. And on top of it you don't have any insurance against the next crash. So where is the golden rule - don't put all your eggs in one basket? The mortgage is the most risky basket ever.

What we are living now is the phase of BTC collections . This is where there is no rush to buy all now but you can spread the purchase over few months . According to a theory , the whales or whoever control the price of BTC has been accumulating BTC over the past months and will do so for the next year. This means they can buy little by little and at the end will own most of the BTC. That's where the supply will start to drop as they will hodl most of the coins. At that moment you will assist to extreme low supply of BTC in the market and hence sudden increase in price which may go to 100k in just couple of months. No financial advise here but just a theory that to me makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:21:03
Well this is another core issue - years down the line - but crypto is not a traditional investment like the stocks. The landscape is changing so quickly, every week there is new stuff popping up and investing in Bitcoin now to hodl 5 years, doesn't seem to be a good deal, let alone 10 or 20. It's like investing in Telsa for 30 years thinking that only Telsa will cover the majority of the electric car market by 2050. 
In the same time you should know that the more volatile is an asset, the longer you should keep it when you invest. Stocks for instance we don't advise them to old people because they can'd hodl the for 20 years but they are more for young people - this is the banking standard. Nowadays both with stocks and cryptos it become super difficult to invest in something for 20 years. Hence the money is not staying here but going away to some other investment areas. For BTC to grow, rich people should see only and only short term grow potential and for that you need price pump, the organic grow is very difficult to implement. The fundamentals are stronger than ever   but again, no money are coming in and that's concerning!

The issue is not people buying cheap \[bless them\] but the young generations condemned to live for the rest of theirs lives in shared flats like in URSS in 1950s. 
Unless you live in small cities or 2h away from the city centre, you are almost forced to spend you live single. This system is not acceptable, I think one study was suggesting that a fair price for a flat needs to be not higher than 3 years of country's average annual salaries. Today in most of the big cities in US , Europe or Asia, we are seeing people earning 25k/year but an average flat cost like 0.5-1 mln$. This is not normal and Bitcoin may be on track to redress that a little bit. Some experts believe that during the upcoming financial crisis the current middle classes may simply disappear or be displaced by a new class of successful people \[including the hodlers\] that no one heard off before. I don't think it's totally stupid to believe masses of wealth may shift towards new emerging assets like BTC.

From the purple line you see the trend s descending. Every-time BTC reaches high dominance and wave of sell-off BTC vs buy in alts starts. I expect to see BTC somewhere btw 75%-80% before the trend reverse back to only 50% or lower dominance. I don't believe in a stable 90% BTC dominance.

But don't worry, 10k most of the guys are ready to invest &amp; loose. If you think the rich guys are afraid to loose 10k you are wrong. The privacy, this is the real problem and ETF will resolve it. You will have genuine conventional way to buy BTC which is not a dangerous asset such as some of the stocks of those huge "safe" companies we saw vaporising in 2003 then in 2008  . Tomorrow the same may happen with Apple or Facebook and the volume of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the fact that Bitcoin is the digital gold and has nothing to do with a scam or fraud [the way you try to depict it]

Remember this baby is said to be worth 1 mln per coin, where are those smart guys with $millions$ , why they do buy it then if that's so obviously nice deal? Sorry to break your american dream but 14% today means almost nothing to me. We are nowhere near the psychological 10k. We should be seeing like an average of 5% daily growth. With the current pace, do expect to see soon  5k rather than 15k.

Are you saying that the price of Bitcoin has no influence on the ETF approval? The information I am having is that many of those 35mln millionaire never invested anything in Bitcoin. Most of the rich actual stay away from crypto and let me tell you as why. They don't trust partners like Binance or Bittrex with regard of KYC and similar stuff. Did you ask yourself where Bitcoin would have been right now if 1/3 of all the millionaire were to have 1 BTC? Well , you can now they don't have it and this has a lot to do with the fact that BTC is still not even close to a proper institutional endorsement. Ok what's the link with SEC &amp; pressure? Well a huge amount of buyers are waiting for that ETF to jump in through theirs banks and if BTC growd to 100k that's not good from the $ perspective neither for the banking business, nor from credibility point for SEC.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:14:06
I am super bull but do expect to see drops in the growth rate of BTC. Basically you need to consider that 100x from now or at 1mln per BTC, = 20 trillions$$$ cap would somehow in BTC. 20 trillions that's a fair amount of money even for a global currency. Another factor , to sell at 1mln a coin, you need to convince   the buyer that it goes next to 10 mln and ultimately to 100mln. I do not believe to see that happening. There will be always bulls on BTC as long as 10x gain is realistic but don't expect excitements as soon as BTC reaches 100k. To me 200-300k / coin would be the limit and the price can be kept at that range based on believes it goes to 1mln but it will never get there i thing. BTC at 100k it's a fair amount to move on and find another entertainment.

Let's wait and see as we say, but for now the majority of HNWI don't care about Bitcoin and I won't believe a sec you if you tell me they are stupid. 
To add, one of the reasons as why we have no rush today is because as well Bitcoin failed to seduce the appetite of many investors. After I am believer [don't get me wrong] but something definitely does not work out the way it should. The price of Bitcoin should have been now in the range of 200k-300k with all the available cash we have in the hands of few million of people, but you see, they don't buy anything now and I can say that by applying a simple counting model [available cash vs Bitcoin price] .
right now we are at 7.6k -2.5%

The odd thing about Bitcoin is that we have 35 mln millionaires and guess how much coins are available for purchase? Remove the hodling wallets and consider what's already lost, I believe from the few articles I read, max 5 mln coins are genuinely in the market. So now  if 1/3 of the millionaire where to have 1BTC average, there would not be enough Bitcoins to buy. Add to that the guys with only 100k in savings, there is 10s of million of them. If they decide to buy 0.1% BTC per person, now how you will find enough coins.
So , question - where are the buyers?

I don't have much of them on cryptopia except few startup tokens that seem to be not even affected but I don't get one point. Why cryptopia does not let the users to connect to the account and withdraw what they have. This is a criminal decision by itself especially if you know that the hacker may strike again and other coins.
I don't think it's done by fear that any will empty its wallets and claim that was stolen cos the hack went through a different way (not like when you withdraw)
So if someone has any clue as why cryptopia is blocking the website, I'd like to hear other theories .
As to the question as why I left them , well cos I had no time for few bucks to play with few more wallets . I would agree that big amount should not be left .

For now we are assisting to buying and selling . Perfectly balanced currency exchange that keeps the price stable .
It won't be the same when people enter into BTC dumping fiat - spend BTC - the seller then takes BTC and use it to buy own stuff in BTC. Basically a closed circle where now one exchange BTC for something else. This will be the BTC adoption and will skyrocket the price but we are still faraway from that. Probably only 1% of all BTC users do that, not even you not even most of the guys here who use fiat.

Did you face the fact that any coin, yes any type of coin that's on coinbase can be integrated into a visa payment and end of story.

For me everything would be equal and when we know for a fact that some other coins jump like 10x higher than BTC that's also a fact.

Total waist of time and money. Why to create another stupid coin when you have 10s of good projects out  including stablecoins.
All they had to do is to build a platform supporting BTC payment alongside potentially of other coins and that's it. Spending 100 of millions $ for Libra only proves that they are not looking to make money or support the users with crypto payment. All they want is more control and power over our lives. Facebook could well make money out of BTC payments but no, they want to own the coin , to own you lives. Don't be stupid to buy that trash.

That's totally fanatic approach. Not selling for what, Bitcoin it's not your kidney. This sort of philosophies are phasing out and fast. I can tell you most of the hodlers that didn't sell at 15k back in 2018 regret a lot \[in the back of theirs minds at least\].  I don't believe you give a good peace of example here either. 
Look, a parabolic rise is only a temporary event \[Bitcoin or not\]. If something went beyond the logical explanation maybe it's time to reverse. Don't be fool, sell and swap with fiat, gold, houses etc \[if you have that much\]. Lee the founder of LTC sold all his coins back in December, and many other prominent hodlers did the same. I don't think you understand more the value of BTC that Lee but the market don't give a crap about that. 
  So on the next bull run when you see something is going up and up, don't be stupid! I don't give you any price range, I leave that bit to you to forecast what means ATH.

Once and for all, good People , don't put in those market something that you don't accept to loose. 500, 1000, 5000$, why you should be sad if you bought at 20k or 15 or 5k. I mean you should not even thing about it, if you do then you do the wrong thing for yourselves.  This market is not for strong buy but for those that don't bet theirs cars on it.

Guys when I see all those comments that BTC goes to 100k or it will never drop or will drop to 6k - nobody really knows what will happen right. I buy to loose 100%. It's just a game for me and then how much I am ready to loose and only then I buy. People here put half of theirs savings . Here some of the reasons why I believe we have to be extra cautious .
1. BTC moved to 10k partly because of the free cash/fork strategy . People get money for free hence only BTC matters at this moment. At some people the forks will stop so what will happen then ?
2. The Altcoins represent the real danger for BTC. Iota for instance now is working with the top companies and the team is made of very powerful people.  Some other cryptos overperform BTC by features and price growth. 
3. Many other cryptos I believe will join the official investment products/futures, and is not going just stay with BTC yet the latter lead the way
4. New payment systems/debit cards soon will open doors to any crypto that can be used to pay in any shop and the shop would not be even aware which crypto was used.
5. More and more people know now about the top 20 cryptos and that BTC is not the only one 
6. What if the big whales switch to another coin ?
7. Don'r you find that there is a bit too much of publicity around BTC
8. If it was a safe long term why all those smart billionaire are staying away from it ? We have 200 trillions in the financial market and only 300 bln in the cryptos
I am not advising you guys what to do but just sharing what are the questions that I ask myself and feel free to share your thoughts here.  For me it's just obvious, BTC grown so much but nothing is guarantied hence I will go for it moderate .

@_date: 2019-12-27 07:27:48
NY traders, world's bankers, the richest landlords and basically the smartest and the richest guys on the planet are investing in all the rubbish because they don't know what you know ? Ok with the principle of cycles but the next one may be in 5 years time and before that another tech breakthrough may happen that sent crypto straight to the grave .
It's not that easy , it's not that straightforward. If people are not buying it, there is a reason as why!!!

little pump before the next big dump . it does that everything, i rather expect to see it in the 5k range by Jan
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:23:15
spot on. there is plenty or conspiracists out there that would always believe that the planet if flat, the man never walked on the moon and the world's richest don't sleep and think on how to stop bitcoin. hahaha

I am also more for 60k given what happened in the past. I expect the market reversal to happen at around 25k-35k where BTC will pick-up and drive up the rest of the market like it happened in April and Nov 2017, then for a couple of month we may assist to a drop in dominance. While Bitcoin will be still growing, the pace will be slowing down then again this should pick up sharp for another new pick that should be 50k+ .  My believe is that after reaching like max 60k+, it will go back to 10k-20k.
Hi everyone, just to be on safe side, don't take the above as a financial advice, it's just my personal believe based on my own calculations, i have no clue what will happen.

When we know what happen in US back in 2010 with "safe" real estate investment,  it says everything about every asset. Whole areas became derelict after being built just few years before the crash. On the point of intrinsic value, agreed that nothing is stable. The Real Estate even has no supporting value and can go to 0.
Now what you explained with regards of the Bolivar, or i can add the soviet rouble and other currency crash examples, the guy above is right that the the drop in value of fiat may not matter in US or EU now but only because everything seems stable . Basically this is the basic reasoning people have. Don't buy when nobody buys and buy when everybody does. Don't worry, now most of the people are sleeping believing everything is going to be fine with Eur, Usd, yean etc. Same reasoning as in 2015 for instance. Many didn't buy a Bitcoin for 300$ and they bought later it at 5k, 10k or even 20k
u/Stevie_wonders88 I am not sure if you are a hodlers but I saw many of those guys on reddit that have no coin and try to give wisdom to others to follow them. Unless the States somehow manage to Ban Bitcoin, everyone, like everyone almost will go back to the exchanges when the crisis hit the core to buy Bitcoin no matter what i say not matter what you say. But at that FOMO moment nobody will find Bitcoin at 10k. The only question for me is WHEN this will happen!
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:20:15
another 6k resistance for another few months, very likely, but this time no more drops to 3k , I hope not, I can't imagine this scenario as we are normally at the end of the downtrend cycle.
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:20:10
This spreading of info was not at all helpful to drive the price though. Basically people pretty much forgot about crypto. There is nothing to suppress here. If it was to happen in Jan 2018 then big YES. But now there is literally reasons to suppress something that not many consider to buy.
Just think:
\- 35mln millionaires on the planet for only 15mln BTC
\- institutional investment platforms like Coinbase
\- i don't know how much more qualified doors to crypto now in comparaison to 2017
And still we are at the levels of October 2017. Open your eyes. There is no gold rush on BTC to censor anything and things are not looking good right now for 2020. Even with the halving we are not secured to reach 20k even.
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:47:06
I can say the same literally for everything that's pending something : eventually the ice in the north pole will melt, the man will fly to Mars , eventually the man will built 1 mile high skyscraper and so on.
I think SEC proved to be unreliable and nontransparent because of the numerous delays with the ETF . This to me wrong and not less damageable to the industry than those who manipulate through misinformation. They failed to the high standards we should expect to from an institution like SEC .

I'd say something must change ti drive the next 10x. Something bigger than Bakkt or Samsung . Etf is one of them, but alongside  of that we don't see much of government endorsements. Would be great to see for instance a bank like HSBC having a crypto account offering for instance. For now wall of silence .

Guys I removed the post not for the content but the form itself which was not well shaped meaning few mistakes here and there. I will re-post when I will have time to re-edit . Feedback taken on-board.
Regarding the 35 mln,  I mean the supposed number of millionaires , not how many people on Earth .
Now for those that went 100% against my English, I'd advise to go a read those post of 2 words like "this is how I hodl "etc... with some funny gifs attached and enjoy your lives. A bit of complexity would not help you hence stay away from long texts . The content while not perfect, It's written in understandable English , you just need to spend time to understand the point which I agree could have been put in a more simple way.

Yes but what is a  **shitcoins** ? If you mean that everything below Bitcoin is  **shitcoins** then you have it all wrong. If it's about those ICO projects that now sink, then I am with you .
Bitcoin is the leader but we should not forget that couple of year ago \[end 2016- beginning 2017\] when some alts were jumping 10x per week Bitcoin was struggling to grow. Same even for the jump in 2017. Yes we saw Bitcoin growing from 5k-20k but then we saw as well other coins growing by 100x. Bitcoin is not the only boat whether you like or not and very soon with the visa / coinbase and other players anything would be converted into fiat instantaneously and ready for any sort of purchase online in store or even direct debits.

For now the only history we are repeating is the downtrend, now you assist to another mini-rise \[today+1.5%\] before the next deep-dive as it's been happening for the past few months. The next support is at 6k+. I hope we don't break it. Since the ATH we are still in the Downtrend my friend, this is the now the story line unless we sharply reverse the trend above 14k
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:01:06
LOL, what's your occupation? 
Bitcoin like any other asset should be just one portion of your investments and be a secondary hope to succeed financially. The primary hope should always be your education, job, career or other source of revenues. For instance I know a guy who is renting 3 studios and living out of the rents and a basic office job. Someone else would be running his own business and hoping to grow one the monthly incomes up to a 5 digit number. I have my job and I am trying to learn new skills.  
Basically have a normal life as if there was no Bitcoin then the prices would be checked less often )

From what i read . sp,e BTC platforms experiences issues today with the the high level of volume , it looks like the wires gets burned if too much. My concern is , if this is the case how BTC look to handle Nasdaq future and coin at 30k for instance ??? 
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:25:59
there is many of nasty situations where people ended up with frozen assets, wrong payments or lost investments without having anyone at all out there to support them. For instance in the derivative market plenty of products sold by the banks are at the edge of legality. Basically they are so risky that you can loose 100x the money you invested and the chanced to win are so slime, rather buy a lottery.   For instance many warrants, you need to be lucky enough to have the price you forecaster and then you need to sell them at the right moment otherwise +/- 1 day they get lost and last but not the least, when you are ready to sell them you cannot leave the market and you end up stuck with your warrants that loose value within hours. Haha, and this is the sort of market that flourish today and nobody do anything about it allegedly because those products are offered to an aware audience - bullshit !

The paper wallet is maybe the best, just store the private key somewhere else as well for back up, Then forget about it for a couple of years . If BTC hit 100k you will see that in the news, so you won't miss the big news even if you forget about it

The next rally will definitively be called BTC. But I believe like in 2016-2017 first we will see BTC jumping maybe to 20k while the alts are watching sadly, then the alts will follow partly thanks to those who made money out of BTC and then will decide to diversify . Yes I know it does not apply much to BTC but some still believe even in crypto you have to diversify with other alts.
@_date: 2019-04-24 02:58:12

Well as of yet I don't see any accumulation except that everyone stay away. Everyone meaning the institutional buyers, Rotchilds and those 75 million of millionaires that are desperate to have at least 1 BTC.
What you have to understand is that in the past only few whales were controlling the market with the exception of few lucksters that did what you describe they did whet dip. Now the whole planet Earth is aware about BTC and they trust BTC . The ELite knows that BTC is not a scam nor money from drug buying etc . They are not that stupid but yet, BTC shows no value to them today. I bet now 99% of rich people stay away from buying the so called dip while in the past we had a different scenario . Rich were not buying cos either were not really aware or had fear of the ban , of prosecutions etc... Now none of the concerns from 2015-16 are here and with the level of awareness we have , it is really concerning what is happening . It's not buying the dip but buying a crashing plan , really gamble which can also grow fast (not saying not possible).
Bottom line, let's not compare the past And what is happening now . Different triggers, contexts, players. All is way more different. Not the same case at all, ok!

Bitcoinization of the Britain 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:04:05
I am not saying BTC is dead nor many of the pro-crypto analysts would say that, but you should not be ignorant either. 1 points that you should not forget for instance is that most of the buyers already bought and lost money . No more money to pour in and to find new buyers good luck. If you check the popularity of BTC , it's falling hard like a rock . The Elite classes (I hope you see it) are not stupid either. 99.99% of rich are staying outside of this trend .
I am saying , this will fall even more then we'll have a period of stagnation or slow growth that will last for maybe 10-20 months . No more jumps by +30%/day . Many will have the memories fresh and won't risks easily any money , especially institutional investors .
Basically to cover this whole , you need to give yourself another 1 year or 2. I'd be optimistic to see  BTC at 50k end 2019 , meanwhile many smaller coins will die , many will loose interest and who knows , maybe something bigger will be invented by JP Morgan or USB that will replace BTC altogether. BTC is not riskless just because it recovered in the past !
The history may  not repeat itself until 2020 or 2025. Look what happened also with the crude Oil or the DotCom prices. Some never recovered , the French CAC40 is at 70% of where it was in 2000.
So no, we can't count in this statement anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:24:28
Well, right now BTC is down -6.55% which is more than the next 9 coins from the top. Let's not be ostriches , this is concerning .
Meanwhile more and more voices come up in support of other crytocurrencies . Anyways , the past performance does not guaranty the future ones, have you heard that statement before ? Well this is what you'll sign before putting money in most of the financial banking products. I think this applies also to BTC. I am not saying at all sell, buy or hodl you BTC . Perso I'd say, to have a bit of everything is the best. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:49:48
He made so much billions and bullions that people will believe in every bullshit he gonna say and sell. Yes he is right but I DO NOT SEE ROTHSCHILDS BUYING NOW ANYTHING HERE  (nor I see those 75 millionaires dreaming to have at least 1 BTC. Nobody now gives a f\*\*\*\*) !
And bytheway where this statement of Hodling come from ? It's a true b\*\*fu\*\*\*sh\*\* culture. Sell when is high , buy when it's low  - this is the art you have to master and not the inaction or ignorance and hodl the cr\*\*\* . This area is made of bunch of pijama traders and saying - yeah , we are hodling yeah, moon , lambos , F\*\*\*k now !!! You are still going back tomorrow to your bricklayer job .
Bottom line - BTC can well succeed and the entire crypto market can soar to 3 trillions , I still believe it's possible , but the culture of moons, lambos , hodl and I donno what is not compatible with this high risk space. The simple consumers needs to be driven by serious indicators not by any empty of sense statement.
I Forgot to add. When something is drooping in price, it's not automatically that this will go back or overpower. Maybe there is a reason for it to drop in price. Like the stockmarket in Europe. After the dot-com crash many said, in few years all stock Indexes across Europe will skyrocket  . But look , the french CAC 40 never went back to 7000 points. Many leading stocks never reached half of the price they reached in 2000. So no, it's not 90% or 50% sure that we go back to BTC at 20k in 1 or even 5 years time and maybe never!

The answer is G20. To understand the current trend you have to know how the professional traders work. There is no hodler outhere . Most of the time they will empty the position as soon as some bad news come in. They prefer to sell low and buy high but safe and won't take further risks before all is clarified . Starting by the fuds back in Jan and now with  today G20 meeting, only few hodl any position except maybe for bitcoin . Hodling means no insurance for you and this is where the hedge funds and ventures are strong . Depends if G20 comes with bad or good news, you will see how things will start to change : either it will crash or it will grow again!

I am not sure you understood the point. Fractional banking is what you see written above. The fact that banks don't hold the money in the same office it's crystal clear for me and most of us. All our money is elsewhere.
The fact that the money from the account are affected to other instrument is known and clear . Are you saying the Stablecoins don't have  deposit in a bank  Or what do you mean by  Stable coins aren't using the same system.  cos the fractional banking is for all of us , not just  Stable coins.

Nice one but we have still a long way to go. 0.5% of the population used at some point a concurrency. Globally not many use BTC regularly and still 3min waiting .

Guys don't be  Ostriches or whatever in trying to hide from the facts. I know those posts are funny and I love to read them and If you ask me, I'd say what you will gain to sell now ? Maybe nothing really , so I am not advising anyone to sell, buy or panic but I don't think is good to see this type of articles here and there or smth like we've been there before (see charts from the past) , or shaking weak hands and all the stuff to hint - we are smart and we know it's going to the moon next month .
Let's face it :
\- the thread for every technology is the time
\- the rule 1 in the investment is that the past performance don't prove the future ones
Basically what people didn't fully realised was that all the price growth was due mainly to the whales. The retailers cannot do anything big to grow the prices by themselves . If the big boys sell out and go in waiting room for the next 2-3 years , there is no how we grow to 10k / per BTC with just bunch of millionaires here and there.
What I am saying is that maybe the sell of is justified . What if we don't expect any big moves for the next 12 -20 months . And obviously nobody knows what will be the tech state with BTC aand others in 2020. Maybe something bigger will come out ? Can BTC survive the long term bear market ? And this is what many are afraid of I believe seeing what is happening with Bcash .
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:50:01
Mate, some leading cryptos are down by 97% since. Agreed that it wasn't really a bubble in light what we saw with dot com for the simple reason, the inflation was not first caused by the retailers . This was some sort of game from the ventures , hedge funds etc... which is ever worse but quite normal for non-regulated markets.
Anyways , it collapsed .

Yeah, you may buy a house and sign for a mortgage for 25 years and next year Hurricane or terrorist attach or war or earthquake credit crunch and none of it is covered by any insurance policy . How likely is that to happen in the next 10 years ? . Not only you'll loose your house but also you will be paying for the rest of your life your empty mortgage. Guess how many people now have long term mortgages . So yeah, everything is possible but does it means something to us ?
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:02:52
Guys it's not just about hodling ;
The guys that now drink champagne and drive lambos are the ones that sell when it's high and buy when it's low - this the art you have to master and not ignorant holding.
**Remember - Bitcoin it's not a human being.** You can actually sell it as well ! It's not a crime if you sell when it's ATH and then you won't chase here comments few months later when it's falling .
Now , with regards of today's situation the biggest mystery for me is who is selling actually at this price ? And why our world's 75 million millionaires are not buying at least 1 BTC for collection, fun or catch up with  the technology or other stupid reasons. - in which case you'd guess , there would not be enough offer to satisfy the demand . So the puzzle stays unsolved .

@_date: 2019-01-11 23:01:58
All the rush is about new institutional money coming in. All the exchanges, bakkt and coinbase corporate accounts are giving the hope that one day big companies like Google , or JP or HP will purchase Bitcoin for use or other financial strategies . Ex. Turkey is looking to avoid currency crisis and invest in gold . What if they decide to move 1% of what they have into BTC as a hedge ? 
This sort of moves will grow the price to 100k and you may be the one to sell what you bought at 7k. The criticism says that JP or a State will never buy BTC especially at that price which means BTC stand no chance to grow to 10x . The ETF as well, if approved, will open up doors to all investor including the State and companies.  
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:28:33
Yes but why ? Imagine you have 2 mln in savings , and few companies bringing like 30 000 $ per month, what's the point of not buying like 10 BTC to have a bit more security ? I mean after all you have a network of 5000 ATMs + LN + a lot of hopes behinds BTC , why not to risk a bit of your money for smth that looks promising even though it may fail as well ?
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:13:50

@_date: 2019-01-12 02:25:32
But it looks like it is . According to some stats we have globally 35mln - 50 mln millionaires and yet. We have no much cash coming from there. See , if half of them decide to invest 0.5 BTC, the price will skyrocket because that would mean 8-12 mln of Bitcoins would be needed to feed that need, but you see , nothing is happening now .
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:05:17
I don't think we'll see 70% dominance. To be at 50% it's already very high  . There is so many coins targeting successfully niche markets . Without going into altcoin analysis here, many don't want to miss the next rdd,verge or nano and hence there will be still plenty of new positions invested/held in those coins/tokens even when BTC start to run on full LN
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:18:43
But those 4 000 you don't spend on holidays or restaurants but you get 1 BTC in return . When I am saying it's nothing , it's with regards of the investment opportunity . Yes, 4 000 is nothing as you have only one type of asset like Bitcoin. I don't think there is plenty of them. This is why to see those rich guys hiding some 4k it's just ridiculous to me. 0.4 This is what they have to spend on one birthday party but maybe you too you have a point. Let's wait and see if the buy now or cry later will apply to my friend.

@_date: 2019-01-13 10:08:36
Yes I fully agree with the last sentence but I can only assume that the wealthy guys are the ones to have more means to invest and way more awareness about crypto . Should we compare  the bus driver with a sales exec that gets let's say 2k from rented flats here and there and has a job paid 80k/year with someone that rent and earn 30k per year. I think normally the first one would be more aware about BTC. Yes we don't need the rich to invest but here the fact, they should be first to invest and I simply don't see it happening . In the same time I don't think most of them know less that you and me about crypto. 
Anyways, we'll see what this year will bring . 
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:12:08
You make reference to the hedge funds or asset management firms doing trading on behalf of the rich guys ? Yes , surely they are also here but I specifically raise my concern regarding the guys having surely 4k to risk and to hodl but they don't do it. Like just put in papaer wallet or forget or get an app and have there stored 1BTC. The hodling is not happening .

@_date: 2018-03-06 23:03:39
I agree but we say don't put more that you can afford to loose. I read a story about a guy from Amsterdam selling his family house to buy BTC when it was at 3-4k , plus wife and kids. Although he might have made a nice profit by now (don't know what happen after) this sort of moves are always wrong no matter how much you are sure it will rise. Now a guy who has 10k in saving and invest 2k, what he is really loosing here ? Will those 2k make him reach or help him to achieve an important goal ? If the answer is no , then the chances of seeing your 2000$ down to 100$ become irrelevant . You won't even check where you put your money and may well buy a lost cause but the loosing state of mind is always stronger.

You call it just comfort, yea , has couple nice cars in his garage on top of a new BMW he is driving , few flats here and there one big house used just for holidays and more importantly run his own profitable business . 
Anyways, I partly understand why he does not care. By this amount of comfort you would not worry about the dollar collapse . For him buying one bitcoin is pointless to the point he is not bothering to invest just 4k in it. I engaged him to the question of the BTC to see how a guys like that would feel and now I know more about the state of mind of the wealthy guys and why BTC does not go up. They just don't worry about tomorrow nor care due the overconfidence they have.

Good and bad news but the main message is that the cryptos are the future which means this market is just a sleeping volcano .
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:37:19
The topic here is BTC being a scam . Which means those are involved are potential criminals . My point was that's nonsense because there is nothing to scam here + You have to call things with the right names not what comes in first in mind. . If you create ICO, take money and disappear that's a scam but with BTC , it's not because you bought it from a random guy 1000$ of BTC today and tomorrow it drops to 10$ then someone scammed you or even worse , BTC itself it's a scam. Scam it's a criminal offence that you need to know clearly the definition. That can apply to some ICO but I don't see how it can apply to BTC or to any established coin out there.
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:46:23
Well as I explained above  35mln - 50 mln people are considered as millionaires . Do the mathematics. You have in total around 15 mln Bitcoin that are tradable . The rest is supposed to be lost . Now tell me how many BTC would be left if 15 mln people decide to buy average 0.5 BTC ? Now think what will happen with the market if it's circa 1 BTC. Are you having or could you possible have enough BTC to satify the demand ? But even if they go and buy 0.5 BTC, I believe the prices will jump like 20x  .
I am not saying nobody from the rich community is buying BTC, but the market shows like 90% don't get involved and if they do, they don't buy a lot of coins..
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:29:49
Yes but look, most of the rich guys seems to be away from BTC. I juat don't get it , 35mln - 50 mln millionaires and yet. We have no much cash coming from there. See , if half of them decide to invest 0.5 BTC, the price will skyrocket because that would mean 8-12 mln of Bitcoins would be needed to feed that need, but you see , nothing is happening now .

stocks means you are optimistic that the economy will grow over the next 15 years . Stocks should be typically a long term investment but can you really believe today that by 2040 you will have enough oil and gaz to feed the economy for instance . The world of today is not the world of tomorrow nor the world of 1970s. Things now are changing, and fast. Be ready for the shock and this means the stocks are maybe not the best place to be now.  Now should you have a bit of everything , yes  why not if you have enough funds. Don't put all the eggs in one basket .
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:40:37
Mate we talk about at least 15 mln people that have available 5k to put in BTC. This would mean no more BTC to buy in the exchanges . Don't tell me that they are all in because this is not truth . No matter how you spread it we are not having now those guys hodling even 1 BTC. What you are saying the rich guys are buying and selling 1 BTC back and forth . For what ? They don't even have time to read out posts here. I don't believe they are buying especially after the chat I had with that guy . They don't give a damn about bitcoin . the reality is harsh I know but you have to accept it - the rich guys don't buy it or at least they don't buy to hodl but rather to convert quickly in something else and move on.
Regarding the variables, yes you cannot know but here it's clear math . 15 mln tradable BTC BUT where are those 15 mln millionaires that want to buy AND hold them let's say for over 1 year ??? This is fact that they are not here. In fact my mate said that he prefer to buy it at 20k and will avoid to buy if this drops to 1000$ . For him only the validation of the BTC as global currency would raise the alarm bell to buy it . This is what I understood .
I appreciate your feedback though . 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:11:00
That's a nice strategy, now I hope we'll see BTC's "came back" . You know in this world nothing is eternal , even for bitcoin . You can't rule out that possibility no matter how optimistic I am (and you can check my previous comments) but I still have concerns because of the G20. I hope it will be positive but we don't know with that they can come up. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:12:32
I don't think that guy is stupid but if I wanted to invest in BTC, I'll have a look on my savings, think how much I can loose and still sleep well and be happy , then add a bit more to the point where I won't sleep well for few days but in the long run I will still be happy in live and this is the sum I can invest.
* don't invest more of what you can afford to loose as BTC may go down again and don't listen and follow anyone not even me, as only a financial adviser can give you an advice , what I wrote was what I would do I have savings to invest it now but it's not a financial advice .
Plenty of other factors may play like , your age, you family situation etc, so think well before any move but don't just listen to a youtuber.
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:17:42

Sure, and I'd recommend to read my previous post about it. No self-marketing but I had a great example of someone wealthy who explain to me why BTC was not in his list of priority 
Now I am on something else. Another factor seems to keep away the rich guys from crypto and this time it's around KYC. I am making some research around and guys, KYC from the exchanges has a lot to do with the avoidance from many wealthy guys to go after BTC. 
Simply it's too much for them. I know someone who told me as well that couple of his friends a bit less wealthy but still, never signed up for any exchange because they found this ID verification process to be a joke . 
What do you expect from those that are not in the boat to say about the boat - well , that's the wrong boat !
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:41:29
Aren't they ? There is around 70 million people that are millionaires and even if half wanted to have at least 1 BTC, there wouldn't be enough BTC for them alone . Yes,  I don't see any interest to BTC now. The only ones that are buying are probably the next moon &amp; lambo dreamers )))
Let's face it, now with the global level awareness we have on BTC, no one from the wealthy community seems to give a damn . The prices speak .
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:30:36
Great point as well, no doubt .
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:37:35
I recalled a story I read about a guy who sold his family house for BTC and went with wife and kids to live in a camping expecting for it to grow to 1mln$ - this was in Holland and when BTC was around the same 4-5k . I hope he is still alive but if he is then hiding somewhere from his wife not to get killed . That's why - do not invest more of what you can afford to loose !
@_date: 2018-03-24 11:03:44
Exciting times for your but 99% of people globally don't have any Bitcoin let alone any altcoin . The day the foundations of the fiat shake and the gold reserves put in doubt all the cash won't have many places to go: the stocks will be fragile , the gov bonds will be affected the real estate may offer some advantage but the cryptoconcurrency will then stand outside of crowd . Btw I rule out that any governmental coin can offer alternative when the country faces bankruptcy.

If I follow your logic then we have to put half of the planet in prison starting by those that campaign for the next President who almost never keeps any of the promises. I still don't see who scammed me if I sell now a BTC at 11k or who did I scam ? To understand what means scam and what means fraud and what means corruption to push some to the media in order to spread nonsense, I'd suggest to google a bit . Most of the people here are honest and they are investing hard-worked money.
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:32:27
because you may end up like now , at minus 85% from ATH which means if you don't sell it at 100k , then it may well go to 25 k . I mean, no guaranty , it mat also go to 300k , I don't know but you take a risk by holding after a huge price increase .

Exactly, technology wise noo doubt BTC is well behind some altcoins but it's still the old very reliable and trustful machine unlike of some altcoins that many never even heard of. Now the LN will save out a bit the situation but they have to resolve the security issues and even now I heard sth about the "fake bitcoin" risk.  I believe each coin will find a buyer and a small place in this market. I don't believe anmore that 90% of the altcoins will go and only the top one will stay. This market and the mining is booming and there will be always some demand. You can see even now after 30 years some people in europe are buying the old russian Niva cars for X or Y reasons . I don't see BTC going away cause low performer or altcoins going away due to the LN.

I just don't get this fear of risking 4k that most of the rich have now. Normally they should all say , ok, bullshit or not, i want to have 1,5 or 10 BTC stored in paper wallet etc and have the peace of mind if ever the dollar drops and BTC rises .

Definitely yes and now I am just thinking who cashed out from the stockmarket bullions of $$$ and where they will be invested next ? It's not a stupid scenario to see big players shortening the crypto market while they cash out 5-10% from the stock to put all that into cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:29:50
Guys let's not forget either that in case if the dollar or euro collapse or any Big crisis strikes like in 2008 , people will rush to theirs banks again and won't be able to withdraw any money. That's where your crypto will be in your wallet. The cash crisis is maybe closer than you think. We don't know really what is going on, maybe yes , Warren is fuding too. Do you think if crisis, Warrent will be able to invest 1 billion dollars in gold and pay with as easy as one click ? Or store tonnes of physical gold in his house or pay with Tresor bonds ? Not really . It's not excluded that he create even it's own Warrenccoin backed by his fortune . Haha,w will be fun. 
Or don't you think that world's Elite wasn't jealous enough to find out they missed the boat while the barista of around the corners got into BTC at 200$ and now will dump it on them at 20000$. Unless, yes yes, unless they crash it again and again until they jump on that boat while other miss it, and the ticket for them will be cheaper.

It's the biggest nonsense because a scam means a scheme to extract fraudulently money in a way that the victim cannot understand the fraud . If I now go to an exchange and buy 1 BTC from you who is the offender ? Imagine if you bought BTC at 15k and now selling at 11k who is the victim ? BTC maybe a bad investment but the times for it to be called scam are over . Basically the medias now are full of illiterate that have no clue what is what.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:27:19
Come on guys , stop to panic, when I read some comments I feel the fear and I see 2 explanations. Either you bet your house on it and for sure you'll be afraid to loose in which case your move was no wise . You really should keep a bit of money here and there but not 90% of all you have or even worse , borrowed money . Or you put the right amount at risk but you are afraid to loose . In both cases you have to learn and change .  Invest only what you can loose and learn to loose in glory )) After all the money is not our life there things more important to loose and for them be more concerned . Did you know for instance 1mln of people are dying per week .
@_date: 2018-11-30 13:07:15
We don't know yet the timeline for the next ATH. While agreed on the short term but , nobody wants to wait 3 years before BTC goes back to 20k. Many cash out to invest elsewhere, other opportunities are also out there .
Important to note till now more than 99% of the rich people got to the moon without crypto and BTC .
Also there is no guaranty on what will happened tomorrow while the cryptos are seen as very risky assets . 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:18:24
Do you really expect for BTC to go down to 1k now when 1 bln people want to invest in it ? For this to take place you have to find sellers while the biggest part is already sold . At the bottom you find the hodlers and paper wallets .  I don't think people will sell it just like that. You need of more seller but you'll find only few to sell it at 1k. I personally expect to have a drop to around 5k before a full recover and then back on green but it won't be 1k. Have you seen the number of ATMs selling BTC ? No way , I don't believe in that unless the States ban fully the cryptocurrencies 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:50:33
Guys let's face it, BTC was a bit of an artificial hype . Why ? Well if you remember the rally started with the free cash from the forks . All the altoins were down and only BTC was up. Not bad, 1 BTC gives you for free bunch of nice and lovey coins while many others were offering nothing big. Now the free cash party a bit over (which also damaged slightly the image of BTC ) and Wall Street involved and more and more games in place that I have no clue about but where all the parties are looking to dive the price down . I believe it will drop quite a bit but then there will be more of an organic long term growth that for me would make more sense . 10K for 1 BTC was a bit too much to digest for some who missed the boat. Haha. But we have to stay optimistic. At some point the buyers should come back. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:04:25
We already saw that 5x growth is nothing in the cryptowonderland . In my view 1 trillion is nothing . Why ? Simple - no institutional investors and very few billionaires in this game and we were already almost at 1 trillion in total. Look 200 bln market cap does not mean every singe bitcoin there worth the price. If ever like 1 trillion $ is invested into this market, expect to see 10-15 trillion market cap. For now the crypto market is just a mini world compared to the US stocks alone . If 1 trillion $ join the market and it will happen sooner or later with the institutional investors , fasten you sit-belt and count to 0 basically.

OK,  Why did Charlie Lee sold all of his Litecoins back in Dec 2017 you think? Him and other prominent investors sold it all during the hype + 100x more anonymous people sold everything to move to fiat, houses, stocks, gold and other nice stuff. I am not negative but realistic. The truth is you look like those indoctrinated guys here in the the trend \[don't sell ever\]. The smart guys like Lee new this crap of today is going to happen then they dumped theirs coins on others and now enjoy the nice time \[hence we are here, they are not\] . The point is not to have Bitcoin, the point is to live a happy live my friend. We are not fanatics of Bitcoin right, we need to face the true, if many sold theirs portfolios there was a reason for that and the reason was not to feel what you feel today. I hope you will understand, this has nothing to do with the greed or weak hands bullshit etc...
Going back to my trend, I only wanted to share my opinion in where we may see Bitcoin in the near future . I am not afraid of the long term but my 2020 forecast is gone for now. I think we will see a consolidation at around 6k yet again and the halving will cause actually more damage than anything. 
Do you know what will happen if BTC keeps a price of 6k after Mai 21 next year? Who will mine BTC at that price? Read a little bit and you may even come back to tell me thank you one day. No miners = no network security my friend. Don't invest more than you can afford to loose basically cos cautiousness applies to every type of assest, gold, real estate, commodities , including Bitcoin. 
And last thing, don't get angry if your American dream is in danger, maybe you will find other stuff to make even more money . 
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:32:30
It's not repetitive, with all the awareness about Bitcoin we have globally, we should have been now easily at 100k per coin. The stupidity of many is this trend is to think they are the only ones to understand what means Bitcoin. Wrong! most of the rich people on this planet have a great understanding of what Bitcoin is but Alas, there is like 100 mln wealthy people on this planet and at least 10% know enough goodies about Bitcoin. But they would have invested buying at least 1 BTC. Do you see that happening ? No! So the end of the story, Bitcoin is not attractive to the all if not most of the investor community , end of line, seat and enjoy posting pics and gifs but in the near future don't expect to see much of miracles I'd say.

To be fair I believe most of the visitors here are already sick of reading the same bullshit messages over and over, where is that Bitcoin going to 1 mln? I am not saying it can't go but there is great examples were things didn't repeat history. Right now btw we are going to 9k and maybe even back to 4k. Nobody knows really!!!
The golden rule of each investor is to say don't invest more from what you cannot afford to loose. Everything is to be taken with extra caution especially now. We don't know if tomorrow Libra will come-in, how it will impact Bitcoin or even what if instead Facebook sign a partnership with another key semi-decentralised coin/player. Not excludes but if happens Bitcoin is gone my friend. You see the market ? It's called cautiousness. There 35 mln millionaire on this planned and not even 1/5 of them have Bitcoin on theirs portfolio. It's not because they are all stupid and you are smart, just for record!
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:24:15
Hey people are tired of reading this sort of bullshit post. Most of the experts agree that a drop below 9k means another long bear process that can last up to 5 years even. We are away from any bullish chart, from all those nice predictions, yes BTC is now 2x from the previous 4k but you can find plenty of shares with the same performance. Basically unless we recover to 10k in the next few hours I feel you will need to re-post your post again every week.

I don't rely fully on those experts either. What I am concerned by is exactly what you just wrote - we don't know ... Btc defied and exceeded any expectations back in 2017. Even it went above McCafee 1mln trend line, but what I am seeing now is that we are assisting to the same now but sadly in the opposite direction. Everyone bought and buys Btc thinking about the halving of Mai and how the prices with jump but maybe that's where the trap is , maybe it's not happening guys. If the main buyers already bought little by little over the past few months without driving the prices upwards , the smalls buyers won't be able to influence the prices and without ETF or new big buyers coming in, people's impact won't help. I am still expecting for the prices to go up but   my nice forecast for 2020 took a strong hit.
@_date: 2018-04-21 08:03:34
You had to imagine what would have happened if BTC was now at 100$ . Would you loose from that you house, job or all the savings you have ? If the answer is no , then you should have kept them but if the answer is yes then you were right to sell it at 6.7k . But if you sold at 6.7 just because of the fear to loose couple of holidays and new ford mondeo , then you were wrong to sell it because the couple of pleasures have no value at the end but your dreams about BTC at 100k  do have ) 
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:20:16
There will be more coins and gov*backed coins by then that will take much of the fund on them, yet BTC at 2-3 trillion cap or Neo at 2-3k per coin,  i still believe it is possible over the next 2-3 years )
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:56:11
I don't care about zooming mate in this case cos I am checking the evaluation for the past 3 years - the trend is descending and don't tell me that since the inception btc grown 10000x. Nobody cares about that anymore cos those that bought BTC at 20$ are long gone - sold and spent that money on cars and houses while you are still here.  So yes, it's not that much fun to me to be honest cos we are now barely at 2x from the crash price. Not promising really and the trend seems to go back to 5-6k , so I expect crash-back rather than moon.

True , if we count , only maybe 30% are really active capable people, not retired or children or sick , etc... We are looking at 2.5bln out of which half have no sufficient access to the media , internet or knowledge about crypto. I thing to say 1 bln are possible customers for BTC is already very optimistic and it will be fair to say maybe only 200-300 mln people on Earth out of those 1bln will be open to risk and will have some money to invest into BTC. This will be our mass adoption - max 200mln

That' the trap. If the State ask you for something then this something is very important . If they do that to BTC the first thoughts for me would be that they expect to make from BTC a global currency or smth.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:44:59

Yes , seen but when? They were selling last year but not anymore , no?
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:54:04
It was a big lie to say BTC and the stocks run hands in hands. This was specifically aiming to hit the price growth of BTC. One of the selling points of Bitcoin was and will always be , the hedge against a financial crisis but last year some managed to convince the crowds that BTC is no much different from stock - lie !
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:43:10
I think many overestimate the importance of Bitcoin being accepted by the retailers . Novograts said it and many agree including myself that *Bitcoin accepted here* should not be important in terms of the value add it has to the world economy and investors. Bitcoin proved to be reliable store of value, digital gold, this is it. No need to argue on that one.
Are you paying in gold to your retailers , are you paying in gold your bills? Well the payment with BTC is way more easier , I agree, and it will be stupid to say that integration of BTC payments in shop like amazon or ebay won't be important but after all the race is won in terms of being an investment class of major importance.
Imagine China dumping the dollar and US bonds in one day . crazy but possible. By the time your plane land in Sidney, your dollar may be -30% down but your BTC likely will jump up. We can always speculate but BTC needs for sure more institutional recognition, Yes, but this should not happen necessarily through *BTC Accepted here  .* BTC can well reach 100k and not being accepted by ebay or amazon but yes it has to get to ETF one day if we want to see it at 100k.

Guys, 9 out of 10 don't know what means bitcoin. no we are still at very beginning ...
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:51:42
But then I can only assume BTC should cost way higher than now no ? Otherwise imagine a superefficent ring that spend time to mine it then you go to the market and it's 4k. It's not profitable 
The danger that I am seeing is that if the coins is not mined due to lack of profit, the network will be non secured no ? Which is bad for BTC .
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:36:24
Unfortunately you can't treat both aspect separately. And this is why we are trading at 3.5k . When most of us get that to have at least 0.1 in BTC can be a great hedge for tomorrow's crisis . When they start believing that the banks may collapse leaving them with little or the stocks may sink like titanic , the BTC prices will follow. 
If 100 mln people understand BTC and decide to invest each 0.1 into BTC , 10 mln coins will go out of circulation and the price will go like 30x maybe in no time , but look . They are all in the illusion that the bad stuff happen only to Africa ,  Russia or others . The day it happens here ,   I guaranty you won't buy BTC at 3.5k

Definitively some people here are out of work but well done in building this . The only thing is that normally none should be killed because of investing here or there . If you are that scared or you worry too much you put some cash that you are not ready to loose . This is not the right approach folks . It's bad to loose but it should not affect you beyond a moderated concern on not seeing your let's say 20% of your saving . The other pain is that your american dream may never see the day but that's all.
Do not invest more of what you can afford to loose .

The price of Bitcoin 10 years ago vs now it's in great similarity with the price of the unknown coin of the Kingdom of Heaven \[I don't know the name\]. They are everywhere and you can get them almost for free. It's almost worthless here and now, yet nobody want them! Everyday we have some opportunities to earn them, and we don't act. But a day will come when they will skyrocket 1mlnX, yet only few lucksters will have them.
Jesus explain truly the financial reward system of the Kingdom of Heaven. Buy now cheap and hodl or cry later. And it does not apply only to Bitcoin. Think always further in the future!!!

Haha, fortunately you can check here people's profile or see if they spammed  others in the past. Anyways if you are looking to get in , in the right (to touch the bottom) time, my thoughts were , we never know . Just as best practice , who cares if it will grow or crash, the essential but is not to put any money that you are not ready to loose .
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:15:32
Correct, except that there will be only around 14 mln bitcoins , the rest lost forever, which means if 14 millionaires decided to buy 1 BTC there would not be enough  .
But you see, the only little trick that bothers me right now is that not even 1/4 (or 8 millions) of all the millionaires seems to be looking to own 1 BTC . Many rich don't give any credit to it.  
The 1% of rich that are supposed to be, after all, smarter than us , do not invest in crypto .
Any theories as why ?
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:29:09
As Bakkt kicks off in Feb , I believe this is when they will approve it. In my view this may be postponed couple times but no more. Otherwise SEC will loose credibility and this will start to look too much like purposely causing harm. 
If SEC expect 20y or even 10, they have to stop this clownism of postponement now and set the right expectations  !

I don't think investing 10% of you monthly pay is catching falling knifes . This is at least what people should be doing at the max from my point of view . No big moves like investing your house or borrowing money for it but just a minimum here and there, little by little over time . Normally you should not give a damn about loosing 10-20% of theirs wages or bonus into a speculative asset class if you are looking to be in the boat . Who give a f\*\*\* if it is right or wrong ?
Invest what you can afford to loose and don't worry about the rest .

You may not have time cos 3 years even for sceptics it's long . Many say the bear should be here for another few months but not many say for few reasons .
For instance to wait 3 years for an ETF on BTC seems to be too long . Banks and customers are in rush to get into the space via the formal products .
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:16:37
Then nobody gives a damn about that so-called believe . The total amount of BTC is not even sufficient to split among a 1/3 of the world's millionaire , but look who is buying it now ? Not many.
20% of all the BTC are said to be lost forever which means there should be tradable max 14 mln but how many people are looking today to own 1 BTC ? We should have at least 500 mln people capable to spend 4k USD on BTC, with access to the web and aware about BTC and  yet not even 1% are looking to own 1 BTC . 
I have to say that I am very disappointed to see after all those bulish news , so little care about BTC, the future finance and the fiat risks. I don't think most of the guys are stupid or illiterate  or BTC is really a trash . This price drop needs a lot of social studies besides the market manips. The market manip would not bring the prices so low if most of the aware people started to buy BTC

Finally a good tweet. Great share . To put it simple and short : don't hodl like and idiot. Buy when low, sell when High . And also, those stupid stop orders in your exchange account are made for something . Use them !
I often read posts about the culture of hodling blabla . Guys don't forget , if you want to get to a destination , take the train sometimes and don't forget to get out, ok . You are not going to a train station because the train station looks nice and you are not jumping in a train because the train looks cool. You do all that because you want to jump in the train and get out when arrived , otherwise either your train will take you back where you jumped in or even worse .
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:55:46
I have to answer by 2 questions .
* How much are you ready to loose ? How much you can delete from your wage or savings without feeling any major impact to your life or future .
* Take the amount you want to throw , then see what you can add extra . Ask yourself the question , how much should I loose to feel down for few days but without this lose changes my life.
The idea for your is to invest what you are ready to loose .
Basically you find the limits of what you can loose tomorrow and still sleep well + how much extra you should loose not to sleep the next few nights well and this should give you the idea on how much to invest .
Now to your question  whether or not you should buy now forget about getting the right answer . Nobody knows , do not try to predict nobody can . Yes, there is % of chances here and there but it's not even 50/50 that you are buying now low . It may well go to 500$ by Jan - Nobody knows.
Last but not the least - THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND I AM NOT QUALIFIED ADVISER . Do your own research and make your decisions if you should buy or not.
Good luck )
 
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:45:04
Well, make sense when you think first, why not a year of stability in 2019 ?
You never know . ETF may be approved in Feb and this can skyrocket at least BTC to new level. Hence folks , nothing is certain  . I disagree with the confident price prediction bit of this post . You don't know as 2019 may be the year of the new ATH to 50k while 2020 may become the year of stability around (just saying random) 30k-50k. In conclusion you never know, be careful of bear traps , meaning tomorrow everything can change and you'll never ever see your BTC at 3.5k
I perso expect rapid ascension to 50k by the middle or end of 2019. Why I don't believe in another year of bear, this is mainly because :
\- BTC is already crashed and already is seen as to be at the good price for those that want to diversify risky stock portfolios . I don't believe many believe Bitcoin will go back to 1k while the 2k as ATL is not a super big risk considering that you can add more to hedge the price drop effect.
\- ETF should be approved soon! Do you really imagine SEC postponing ETF every 2 months . This won't look professional nor credible if keeps repeating over and over. This is bad for SEC and will raise further negative conspiracy rumour to the next level.
\- Bakkt and institutional products already  kicks is like the next hot trend
\- The stocks are not doing great which drive interest towards cryptos
\*After this is not a financial advise, do you own research and make decision to buy,sell or do nothing .
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:43:05
You have to say it goes to 1 mln so the fools buy it at 20k and then you say it goes to 1k for fools to sell it at 4k

@_date: 2018-12-21 13:32:34
Make sense but now the situation is very different. I don't see Bitcoin in half-bear market for another year simply because too many institutional channels will exist in 2019 meanings if a State or company decide to invest or use crypto for x or y , 1st there will be plenty tool for that , 2 the market is so low value that any move from big investors will cause rapidly a rise to ATH , maybe within few weeks. There is plenty of other stuff that will exist in 2019 and were not here back in 2016 which may move the prices well higher .
Who knows, maybe the year of correction will be the year of the actual  **halving** while ATH is hit by 2020. 
No exact science here, let's wait and see .
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:56:32

Long story short, either we are all wrong here or they are all wrong there. Only the time will show, but to let down BTC at 3.5k , it does not sound to me like a wise decision for people that have millions . What is for them to invest 20k now ? Nothing really and yet they do not do it. I can't get it , something is really wrong here.
For instance since last year the BTC users quadruplet and the price lost 82% . No connection to the real economy . Anyways, let's wait and see.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:01:28
Now the question is , do you want to swap you bitcoin to gold your want to hodl?
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:44:41
Agreed .
To expect the total market cap of all the cryptos on the planet Earth at around 200 - 500 bln  , in my very personal view is totally unrealistic . Let's not forget that 70 bln cap for BTC is circa 1% of the gold market cap.  A cap that's based a lot on paper gold, which actually do not even exist .
I hardly see where rich and midclasses should invest a portion of theirs money if not in BTC , in time of debt crisis, stock crash and BTC network expansion (LN). More than happy to see them going to gold and real estate but the smartest people should know that in US plenty of flats were left derelitct after the credit-crunch and that gold is already too high to go even 3x let alone to be stored at home.
The only credible alternative stays crypto . BTC will soar in my view and it may well go beyond 100k in a matter of weeks. Believe it or not I don't carem but if every millionaire decide to buy 1 BTC there will be 2 times shortage of BTC. How in that case BTC will cost just 3k ?
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:56:37
There is no loss in something that you already lost and forgot . Do you for instance lose money by buying yourself some socks ? No, because you feel there is value that the pair of socks deliver to you.
If for someone feels that a regular investment delivers value, and let it be BTC, then who cares about the loss of the few grands you accepted to loose ? It has not even any signs of trading , we talk about investment in speculative assets which can also be investing in shares. Imagine you love Microsoft and you buy its share. Well many love crypto and buy crypto.  
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:40:15
Short answer , No !
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:44:15
There is 3 points this chart don't take into account though .
\- the retail adoption and
\- involvement of institutional players, both growing consistently
The market is not the same guys . We have futures and the market is not regulated , we have Bakkt that will do everything possible to insure theirs customers see 50$ this month and 100$  next month  on theirs wallets . The ETF may catch us by surprise , the world is on track for the next financial cirise , etc. To believe that for the next 12 months no fresh money will go to BTC it's a bit foolish no ? How do you imagine SEC postponing ETF every 3 months ?
There is too much factors very different from what we saw in the past. 2 important investment laws :
\- past performance does not guaranties future ones (for gains or loses )
\- do get caught in a bull trap but same goes for the bear trap . Remember when BTC was at 20k many were saying - still few month growth to follow - or - this will drop but unlikely we see another  long bear market, etc . Now many are relaxing and waiting for BTC to go down to 1k by next summer but the truth is that all those technical analysis depend a lot from the fundamentals . You may well live the last days of BTC at 3k as well, hence be mindful , nobody can predict the market .

I don't see how it can go further down  . Maybe another 1k or smt but never to 0 , or , if it goes to 0 then this world is not made just of stupid people but of true donkeys .
1. Plenty of big companies every week get involved or announce plans to get involved with BTC in 2019
2. Everyday we have more ATM and LN  here and there
3. The number of users only grow
4. The trust in the economy and fiat decreases .
5. more..
Only donkeys will do all the hard work for nothing . So mate , I kind don't see the smoke of a burning house to expect BTC at 0 or even 1000$ in all fairness . If there is no smoke there is no fire . I see only a flourishing new payment system led by Bitcoin .

- Coinbase Revamps PayPal Withdrawals for US Crypto Users
- Sephora Shoppers Are Getting Their First Bitcoin Using Crypto
- Venezuela Starts Converting Pensioners' Payments to Crypto
- German Stock Exchange Giant to Launch Crypto Trading
I mean for a sector that worth 100 bln we have a lot of progress every week. The number of users grow , the adoption grow , the projects develop . I am not sure how you compare a technology in movement with a stupid house you are hoping to re-seller for more.
Here there is a motion that goes in one direction - growth and development . So what is that you don't understand with BTC ?

Basically he is saying guys  no more 1 mln $ to BTC . The time of the euphoria is over . When I am thinking that many relied on this statement to buy BTC at 10-15-20k I understand why the market crashed .
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:13:30
In order to be able to sell BTC at 20k you have to convince others , they are buying an asset that goes to 100k or 1mln . Otherwise you will never sell it to anyone at 20k. Now for some in panic , the story line should be BTC goes to 2 or even 1 k . Sell quick while it's at 3-4k .
Basically another way of explaining Fomo, hype and stuff like that. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:21:33


Yes I agree that you don't see what you should see from a global monetary system but this is why as well 1 BTC is at 3k today .   
Regarding the lack of stability , cryptocurrencies are now like an emerging volcanic island. Imagine one of those Islands are Hawaii 5 mln years ago and the land cost there really really cheap. No one buys it because exactly for the reasons you described . But well , this is why you should consider that the day it become a great place to be and part of the USA, you won't see this piece of land at that cheap price . 
Basically you are right and wrong .
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:48:09
Great share mate. Come on guys we need more of those success stories to show that in crypto it's not just hodling but also selling . 
I know some big players that sold everything back in Dec. Yes, everything . No moaning anymore or praising the hodling . It's just this is the way it is - you have to buy low and sell high (BLASH) not hodl.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:21:35
Normally this is the whether you will have in the next financial crisis and it will be very cold :
\- no more cash injections possible like in 2010 (we are already at the bottom financially)
\- the paper gold is less trusted than even
\- the physical metals cannot be stored by big private buyers at least not by billions 
\- payment system other that the fiat to leverage the crisis, does not exist - unless you consider to buy BTC
\- the stocks are crashing = need to get out from NYSE
\- real estate already overpriced and will not be safe is crisis 
\- the State bonds &amp; tresors are not safe because of the debt crisis 
\- the fiat price won't have stable grounds for the reasons above 
\- many will panic and try to get the cash out of the accounts but won't succeed 
  
Guys, tell me where you want or you can invest in the scenario above if not in BTC ?

@_date: 2018-12-11 21:00:54
Well for the property market the value is to give shelter to someone . If you have 5 building, for you the value of each building is what it can bring back as revenue :
- crisis means less return as there will be less jobs and hence tenants
- the rent will drop and hence the real estate value 
- only top locations will survive like now BTC survives but many alts dies out . Example many residential areas in US did not recover after 2009 and the investors never managed to sell those houses for even 10% of the paid price . Now those areas are derelict .
BTC going down ?
While we have to be careful of the bull-trap, the same goes for the bear-trap . Guys do not assume BTC will go down from here. You may never ever see BTC at this price again . It can go so quick that you won't even have time to write a post here. BTC now has low liquidity and every 10 billion $ invested in BTC over a short time (12h) can grow the price even by +50%. There is no much sellers left.
Another great example is Ethereum. Was at 8$ in Feb 2017 and many were saying there is plenty of issues with Ether and there much room to go down. Go and check the comments written back in Feb 2018. Then within 3 weeks Ether went to 70$. Some said , let's wait it will go back to 8$ and they are still waiting . And I feel that they will never see it at 8$ again no matter how bear is the market. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:58:40
Yes, agreed but like 300$-500$ is not either a big amount . In countries like Russia, India and China this is well affordable sum to have in savings . Many have over 10k in $ in savings and already great exposure to internet and technology . I remember having watched a documentary about Chukchas in Siberia and they had internet, laptop and mobile in theirs wooden houses. I believe 100 mln is well doable in the current level of awareness as many will rather buy via coinbase that go to meet a banker especially in those poor countries . Ok, let's see where we go with this pump of today .

Yes  Institutional  customers are buying but we are still far away from FOMO, the prove is in the price and volume.. If they start really investing like 10%into BTC , we go immediately to the moon. 100k would be at reach within weeks but, no. I believe this trend will be very gradual. Like in Russia we had further delays around crypto maybe till the end of this year and the banks don't care if they miss the FOMO cause it's not theirs money , haha. Same for China and India.
On the positive note we should expect involvement from some institutional investors at the begning in the range of 0.1-1% then next year btw 1-5% then by 2022 maybe like 15-20% exposure hence McAfee's prediction is not that stupid.
Bottom line no Fomo for the companies but yes to gradual involvement .

I agree on the last stand . Those that say - pay salary in crypto , BTC better that visa, hodl till you die  are likely driven by ideological views : reject the SWIFT , current system, the State, etc and indeed when I check myself , most of the money transfer now via the bank don't cost much, if not international,or are simply free and fast enough . However the use case of crossborder transfer and especially for big amounts is very strong for crypto.
Now if it goes to invest as store value , the chance you get with BTC is that unlike of the Apple stocks , here you will be able to hold them in you Samsung mobile (soon to come) and imagine if you travel from LA to KL - if by the time you land there a military coup hit US, you dollars will likely take a hit as well but you will always be able to spend your BTC and rent a hotel or buy pizza . Maybe even your portfolio will grow by x5 by that time. 
If you have money , let's say 500k, should you put in BTC 250k ? Perso I think if you are getting ready for the next fiat crisis and you know BTC has a potential to go fast 10x, why not to invest like  50k or even just 5k, just to make sure you are not completely missing the boat. No need to get too greedy - balancing act is the key word .
The  concerning point that is bothering me now is the fact that only 15 million BTC are tradable and we have like 30 mln millionaires on this planet . It's very weird to me that at 3.5k nobody is rushing to buy just 1 BTC. Imagine if half of the millionares do that investing not even 1% of theirs money, there won't be enough BTC to feed the hunger . And yet, we observe now a wall of silence . Very odd to see the level of disinterest . Why someone with 1 mln won't invest just 3.5k ?
