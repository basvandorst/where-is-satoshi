Coinbase will deploy segwit when market dynamics force them to, not because people complain about it online. If they lose business to companies doing things right, then they’ll change. But so far people are on the one hand complaining about Coinbase congestion, but on the other continuing to use the service and pay the fees.

Hey there. I’ve been in since 2011, so I’ve had a front row seat to the community since basically the beginning. There has been a war over this topic for about 3 years. There’s a huge amount of work being done to upgrade. The currently known upgrades are a block size increase, segwit, lightning network, Schnorr signatures, and MAST. Do your own googling on each one, but that’s the current landscape. It’s an extremely contentious topic that a lot of smart people are working on. 
Keep the faith my friend. We’re gonna make it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:32:11
Imo it’s not going to pump the price until it’s actually actively allowing for a ton more transactions. 
Posting ideas is great. Proof of concept is great. But people need to see it work for a long while before they start joining in. I mean, think about bitcoin itself. It was technically proven to work in 2009, but it still took years to build people around it. The same thing will happen with lightning. We need to see it work for months before it starts effecting price permanently. 
Obviously hype can pump, but that’s not permanent. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:01:25
You can't just declare by fiat and dictate that there's no niche value being filled by it. The world ***as it actually exists*** provides a mountain of evidence contradicting you.
If LN, SW, and Schnorr deliver as promised, I'm 100% back on the BTC train, but in the meantime, this graph fucking explodes the argument that there's no legitimate contrasting value being offered here.

Oh shoot I have no idea. I believe it’s still unknown what the network will look like, or it’s topology as the experts call it. Theory is there will be hubs that handle lots of payments. So like a paypal on lightning, but consumers are way more empowered because of extremely low barrier to entry.
In general, this is a network that will grow organically, and we have to wait and see what it’s going to look like.

Ppl are giving them shit now but it makes a lot of sense. Coinbase has arguably done more to spread Bitcoin then any other single company in history, and they are human beings responding to a worldwide explosion of interest in Bitcoin. People need to zoom out and chill out.

Bitcoin has a 1mb blocksize. Bitcoin c.ash has an 8mb blocksize. Fees are lower on the second one because of that. Core fears that increasing the blocksize will result in centralization because fewer people will run full nodes. 
That’s basically it. The two bitcoin subs are dug in and fighting over that. Welcome to the fucking show. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:11:59
You misunderstand me. I am literally talking about the bitcoin core software. They haven’t added a UI support for Segwit transactions. Coming in the next update. I say all that to say, people get mad at exchanges for not enabling segwit as soon as humanly possible, but Core itself has taken their time pushing it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:44

Mining is income at the time it's received, at the value at the time. So he'd owe back taxes at his income tax rate based on the 2010 value (which is basically nothing).
Then, he'd owe capital gains tax now (long term rate) on the gain that has occurred. So in practice, nearly all of the tax owed would be in the form of long term capital gains (which is good because those rates are much lower than income).
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:58:15

@_date: 2017-12-14 13:34:40
That’s not verifiably true. Even without attacks, demand for transactions could rise and fall for a whole host of reasons. Anything creating additional drama in markets, big markets like China going to sleep (if you’re looking at hourly timescales), big price movements, exchange hacks, big legal news, all of those things could cause big spikes in demand. 
I’m not saying you’re 100 wrong, but this is really just circumstantial evidence at best.

Look, I’m not going deep with this because at the end of the day i don’t view it as a very important topic, but this link has a bunch of SUPER dubious logic. This is not evidence in any technological sense, it is political conjecture. 
Example: “Greg Maxwell opposes bip148, therefore core developers didn’t have consensus on it, yet it still happened.”
Problem 1: Segwit being adopted does not equal bip148 being a decisive influence. They supported segwit before 148, and advocated for segwit, and segwit was adopted.
Problem 2: “...yet it still happened”. Again, what is “it”? Broad signaling for the UASF? Or segwit being adopted period? How are we defining success of UASF? It being politically influential? Popular among nodes? Or segwit was activated?
The bottom line is that attributing the UASF to segwit adoption requires a kind of vague political thinking that I find very annoying. It was a disruptive tactic that our history should not encourage in the future. Over exaggerating the degree to which it “succeeded” by conflating a purportedly decisive role with mere concurrence with segwit doesn’t serve us well. 
Bottom line: it’s political conjecture. Unproven. Subject only to anecdote. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:55:07
It's more than reasonable to think the UASF had close to zero impact on Segwit being adopted. I remember the adoption rate of it being in the mid to low single digits of %. Saying it was a success, just because Segwit was ultimately adopted, is disingenuous.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:59:37


I know that YOU know this, but I have to call you out for this. There is no definitive evidence that the UASF had a determinant role in achieving the adoption of Segwit. It occurred concurrently, but intimating that it was primarily caused by the UASF is not settled history -- it is a claim without evidence. UASF adoption was very very low leading up to August 1.
I'm happy we have Segwit, but we shouldn't distort history and diminish the voluntary collaboration of multiple parties that made adoption possible.
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:45:21
War has two parties. One shows an obvious and overwhelming capacity to win, the other surrenders. Pretty obvious why people would find that skepticism silly. 
Bitcoin has at least 6 major factions. Reducing a major protocol change to being primarily caused by a SF that a small number of users had committed to, in the absence of broad miner support, broad business support, broad developer support, broad user support, and broad node support, is silly historical revisionism.
Insinuating that it was a decisive factor undercuts the actual work that was done to coordinate the upgrade.

I'm asking this question in good faith (and to be fair to you I'll tell you up front that I am a BU supporter). In what way are you considering mining to be centralized? 
To me the mining world seems like one of the most decentralized parts of the Bitcoin community. Anyone can buy asics and run them, and put their hashing into any (or most) pools.
To me "mining is centralized" seems like an "up-is-down" statement and I don't see any way that it's true. But I'm deferring to your knowledge and open to you changing my view.

What do you mean by this? That it doesn't matter whether Adam signed with his title or not? My understanding was Adam supported and Blockstream does not, and if there's a divide then his title matters quite a lot.


He's still responsible for what he agrees to, and what his title represents. If he was out and out coerced into misrepresenting the company's position, that's something worth claiming openly and loudly, but this in between stuff doesn't jibe.


Frankly I'm not really sure what you mean by this. So the meeting was branded as not-involving-agreements, and then when people got there they were forced to come up with one? 
I'm getting the sense that there isn't even agreement on what this agreement is or compels people to do  . . . 
@_date: 2017-02-07 09:35:14
My sense is a blocksize increase, even a very small one, is a broadly popular proposal, so proposing that, then quickly shelving it as I guess Luke did, while we have a year long campaign for Segwit, seems unaligned with the desires of the broader community. But hey that's my two cents.

Global warming is actually a great example of a problem that has some controversial solutions and clear trade offs, and consensus is near impossible. There is no consensus on the CONSEQUENCES (in terms of degree along a spectrum), only it's existence. We lifted 1.1 billion people out of poverty in the last 15 years, and burning fossil fuels was a key part of that process, maybe THE single biggest part. So it's more than a lack of an informed public -- it's about trade offs at the highest level, and we don't even know the trade off because the science isn't there (and may never be because of the vastness of the system). 
@_date: 2017-02-04 05:24:48
Gotcha, thank you so much for the explanation!!
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:24:18
Thank you for your response. I want you to know I'm proceeding through this in good faith and am giving you and everyone else the benefit of the doubt in a tough situation.


Per this link  it was signed "Adam Back, President, Blockstream", was it not? I know he was not the CEO -- but I didn't say CEO, I said President. And again, we need to view these things through the lens of "how does every signatory view the document and the authority of other signatories".
So you have three choices: either, 
1) This February 20, 2016 Medium article is inaccurate in printing Adam's title as President.
2) Adam agreed to the HKA, while Blockstream as an Org disagreed. This would be a pretty rough act by a company president for many obvious reasons.
3) Adam and Blockstream agreed to the HKA, but want to distance themselves from it today.
You seem to be moving toward option  And while I won't finger wag and claim some moral outrage, it's really worth looking at that and seeing the amount of confusion that could cause. If he was "President of Blockstream", regardless of what YOU say that title means, he should sign a document that Blockstream officially and unanimously endorses, period. If there isn't agreement within Blockstream, he should not have signed.
And for the record, when I say big communication problems, THIS is what I'm talking about Greg (by Core team I meant Blockstream, as well as the active dev team for Core). People are confused because there are significant differences between the HKA and SWSF proposal we see today. And since SWSF depends on miner approval, strong communication with miners is vital.


I acknowledge it wasn't a binding document, but we went from SW as HF and 1mb to 2mb as HF, to SWSF. The plain language is very different from Core's current plan.
When people play games (recreational games, or games like politics) with each other, things go well when trustworthiness and predictability are established. If someone is suspected of cheating the rules, whether true or not, the ability for people to cooperate breaks down. This stuff isn't engineering anymore, it's politics (and I hate to say that). And in the realm of politics appearances matter, and consistency matters. And in my view there are some serious communication challenges between devs and miners that need to be addressed.
Again, thank you for taking the time to write back. Don't take this as moralizing or finger pointing at you. I've been in the space since 2011 and what I've seen the last year is heartbreaking.
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:16:41
I can honestly understand how this could have been an honest mistake -- you guys are all engineers and scientists, not business/political type people. But I sincerely hope that, at least privately, some of you acknowledge the severity of this blunder, and work to correct it in the future (ie never do something like it again). Bitcoin is in a crucible right now, and all parties need to grow up and take responsibility for their actions for the good of the protocol.
The HK agreement was meant, in part, as a public document, meant to be seen by the public, to influence and unify the public toward a common roadmap. There is no "Adam Back, President of Blockstream" who is an individual. We all know him as the President of Blockstream, and he signed as the President. His signature represents Blockstream's approval to any reasonable person, and if Blockstream didn't want to overtly support the HK agreement, Adam Back shouldn't have signed. And if Blockstream opposed the agreement and Adam signed anyway in violation of the broader views of Blockstream, then frankly that's an abdication of his responsibilities as the leader of the company.
This controversy isn't random, it's not unforeseeable, and it isn't merely the product of a Roger conspiracy. It's frankly just a PR blunder, and continuing to deny it impugns your credibility.
I'm not asking you to overtly confess "you're RIGHT you're RIGHT we're SOOO SORRY". But I would hope that, if even privately, Blockstream's core team acknowledges that they have a big communication problem, and it may quite literally tear this protocol asunder.

Your argument just straight up makes no sense in real world application, and your condescension has basically poisoned the well for further discussion. I never said there is no censorship in China, that's a ridiculous straw man argument. I said that regulation/censorship will be ineffective and the protocol's antifragility will route around it. 
The US regulates and prohibits certain internet activity, not to the degree of the GFW obviously, but it is conceivable for there to be regulation re: mining in the US as well. No one worries about it because such regulation would likely have little impact. As they would in the PRC as well. 
Carry on Keyboard Warrior!
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:41:58
Individual people in China running mining equipment does not equal "one state censoring communistic government in control of the network resources". It's not the government, it's people who own and make asics just like you or I could. The majority of mining being done in China does not equal centralization. And if PBOC drops the hammer, others will fill the vacuum because the PROTOCOL allows for that. Which leads me to my still unanswered question. 
I am asking Luke, at the protocol level, what does mining centralization mean? So far I haven't seen a satisfactory answer.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:51:24
Yeah could someone please just explain what the utility/purpose/use case is? I read through 8 minutes of the slides in the video and I have absolutely no idea what the purpose of this is.
 You're only going to find interest if you 1) make the value proposition very clear or 2) the audience is interested in the technical framework that the protocol is being made within. About 95% of the readers here fall into category  I don't mean to be obtuse but I'm curious how this idea distinguishes itself from others.
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:58:56
Respectfully, I of course agree there is wealth inequality in the world, but that hasn't answered the question. The fact is CURRENTLY the mining ecosystem is extremely decentralized. The largest pool only has 14.8% of the hashing power. And the cost for one nefarious actor to buy up a majority of hashing power and do bad things would be astronomical, in the 100's of millions or maybe billions of dollars. Of course it costs money to mine, but it costs money to run a node, to hold bitcoins, etc. It ALREADY costs money to have a say in the bitcoin ecosystem.
So the question still stands: what does Luke mean when he says mining is currently centralized, or that it would get worse in a BU environment? I see that argument thrown around and if it's a FOUNDATIONAL part of the argument against blocksize increases, or BU, it needs to be fleshed out a little better to become convincing to those open to being convinced, as I still am.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:26:16
I'm embarrassed for you, for thinking that this is true.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:57:15
I just really can't get behind this argument, and TBH I think it's one that just depends on xenophobia/fear of the unknown to work.
Bottom line  Mining pools are made up of many individuals, who can move their hashrate wherever they want. They aren't being forced to do anything. Jihan doesn't "control 17% of the hashrate". He provides a service which 17% of the miners have chosen to patronize.
Bottom line  If the PRC cracked down on miners (which has not happened once historically), then the network would route around the censorship -- mining would flow elsewhere.
The notion of full nationalization of Bitcoin mining in China, to put it bluntly, is fucking insane and improbable. And even if it happened, the fix would be quite easy.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:12:28
He admits in his own twitter comment that it's not real.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:39:48
You can play that game in any direction you want though. Would you still be as suspicious if it were "the American miners trying to establish control"? Or if there was a particular company that employed the vast majority of the most active devs, would you say that that one company was an interest group trying to establish control of the dev process?
Miners in China are mostly just individuals with equipment, hashing with whatever pool they like. And if they pay close enough attention to the Segwit/BU battle, they signal their support for that too. Generally I think conspiracies of takeovers are more complicated than meets the eye, or just non-existent.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:56:44
Alright thanks for the response. I'll take some time to chew on this, thanks again.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:03:58
Uh what? Are you saying the plan for scaling bitcoin all along was to somehow phase out miner's fees? What are you talking about?
edit: the point in question is that Jihan WOULD VERY OBVIOUSLY make more money if the price of BTC was 1500 or 2000. There is an absolute rock solid correlation between total transactions occurring on the network, and price. If BTC price were higher, that would almost certainly occur with a higher number of on chain transactions, which means higher mining fees.
It's hard to sell people elaborate conspiracies when there are much simpler alternative explanations.

And buying an ASIC is also open and voluntary. Just because there are economies of scale leading to a few leading manufacturers of ASICS, doesn't mean there is centralization in mining behavior. Someone can buy an ASIC from Bitmain and configure it however they want.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:08:17
A pool owner provides a service for his customers, who are the miners. If all of Wu's customers opposed BU, they would be free to leave his pool. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:14:51
It's a free market. ASIC's work better than GPU/CPU, period. The only solution is to either invent your own that works better, or change the protocol (which would be a moral travesty, imo).
And just because Chinese manufacturers dominate the market doesn't mean that "China the nation" controls mining. The Chinese govt has taken a nearly hands off approach. If they were to crackdown or try to exert some control, I am certain that mining would go to some other area in response. I get what you're saying about points of attack, but this isn't one of them. The only reason the ecosystem hasn't "solved" this is because it hasn't presented itself as any kind of problem yet.
At the end of the day these are mostly Chinese individuals just trying to make money, just like any one else.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:05:52
At this point I think a lot of the miners are mining exactly where they mean to, in terms of BU vs SW. I'd bet a lot of Antpool miners are there precisely to support BU. But by all means, keep up the public appeals and keep it in miner's minds: they should contribute their hashrate only to pools that they support, so we all can see where the support really lies.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:03:24
What's funny to me is that changing difficulty via hard fork got the least votes, but IMO, if there was a fork and BU went off with ~75% of hashrate, hard forking the minority chain to reduce difficulty would be ESSENTIAL. The alternative for the minority chain would be far more dangerous in my view, but seems that people here don't fully grasp the danger.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:02:18
This entire post is conjecture lol. Jihan "controls" the hashrate? He can't tell his customers what to do anymore than any other business. He can extort miners with equipment he sold them?

Financial speculation gets an unfairly bad wrap. You are making a bet on the future value of an asset by buying it. In so doing, you are taking a risk that others in our society don't want to take. All of the people speculating on the price of Bitcoin are providing an ESSENTIAL service to the broader economy: they are aggregating their knowledge to come up with the PRICE of bitcoin.
This is how all speculation works. People take risks that no one else is willing to take, so that markets might arrive at efficient prices for assets. You are contributing in a very real way to the market by doing that.

It's still not even applied fairly. Using the language on the sidebar, promotion of Segwit should not even be allowed, because there has been no demonstration as of yet that Segwit has overwhelming consensus.

That attitude is a great way to lose a ton of money. There's no way to predict the top of the peak. And what if the price crashes say $50, you think it's gonna crash, sell your position, then the price rockets back up $100? It's happened before, and can happen in super volatile times.
Trading around massive market events is very, very, very difficult to do profitably. Be careful!

God I'm so glad you explained this so I didn't have to. A guy like Jihan, who has invested an absolute fortune into the infrastructure of Bitcoin, isn't going to piss it all away for short term gain. He's doing this because he thinks it's the best way forward. Now he could certainly be WRONG, but accepting his sincerity is not only reasonable, Occam's razor kind of demands it.
Secondly, I don't understand why people think if you founded/maintain a mining pool, that all of the hashrate is "under your control". The miners at Antpool are individuals for the most part, like you or me. If a miner disagrees with Jihan, they can leave the pool. And pool hashrates fluctuate all the time.
 The idea that Jihan controls all the hashrate of his pool is bunk, made to appeal to the lowest common denominator of people engaging in this debate.

Can you give me say, ONE example of the Chinese government doing absolutely anything related to Bitcoin mining? Anything to suggest that they plan on "governing Bitcoin mining"? People are conflating the government with the citizens, and it just doesn't make sense. And I see this fallacy all the time.
No one is arguing that the Chinese government is not censorious or overbearing. But as I said, mining is a very bottom up process, and one that would easily route around censorship. If any type of crackdown were to occur in China, I'm sure that most of that mining opportunity would flow to other countries within weeks and months. 
The odds of the Chinese government disrupting Bitcoin mining in any type of meaningful, durable, and permanent way is practically zero. And I can't think of a single convincing reason why that isn't the case. I honestly think this is just irrational fear of a foreign country.

As I said above, if BTC price goes up, that will almost certainly go along with a corresponding increase tx/s, and thus, aggregate fees.

@_date: 2017-03-25 14:49:06
He makes more money from transaction growth, which on chain scaling will provide in a linear way.
Why are you even talking about offsetting block reward? That isn't part of this discussion. The choice is between increasing tx throughput on chain, which gets Jihan more fees AND would almost definitely increase the trading price of BTC, or increasing tx throughput off chain, which would produce revenue streams out of Jihan's reach.

Jeff Garzik has been against them for a long time, and many of the older more libertarian minded devs are as well, because they are not opt in, i.e. It's a tyranny of the majority. 
Not exactly the case with this segwit proposal because of the 95% rule but there are serious and legitimate concerns about a precedent for soft works moving forward. There's a video I'm looking for of Garzik discussing this earlier than that article, I'll link it if I can find it.
Source: I support segwit (and algorithmic or emergent block size) and generally oppose soft forks. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 17:09:01
Because it's still only a temporary fix assuming regular growth in transactions per second. We need a permanent fix to the block size question and some feel the devs are more focused on off chain scaling, which may be primarily to the benefit of those who run/maintain/control side chain solutions, rather than on chain scaling.
To me it's clear that we need an algorithmic approach to the block size, or something that is a result of an emergent economic signaling process. I hope it comes to be. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:38:15
What about blockchain.info? You own the private keys there right?
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:34:15
Not all of them are in favor of its implementation as proposed. Jeff Garzik, for example, is pretty opposed to implementing via a soft fork. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:09:15
I mean if devs are writing code that the miners don't want that's kind of on them too. There's no point having devs writing code that the community doesn't adopt.
There's a serious communication issue that needs addressed and both sides need to come together and compromise to get things done for the whole community. If Segwit isn't adopted that should be a big signal that the approach isn't working. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 17:02:48
Thanks for the kind response, I appreciate it. I found the Garzik video, he may have had other concerns about soft forks that I can't remember. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:12:12
The block reward is public knowledge, and attacking the rules to change it would be impossible to do covertly.
Too many think that miners are dummies only interested in short term profit. At the end of the day they want the price to be as high as possible long term, and messing with the coin cap would violate one of the fundamental promises of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:47:26
There's a perception among miners that the negotiation has not proceeded in good faith. A lot of miners and users place a higher priority on flat increasing block size, and if that isn't included in proposals I don't see segwit being adopted either. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:07:54
For the record that was my impression 100% as well. You were deliberately misinterpreting the discussion as it related to ASICBOOST disabling. Since you have a great deal of credibility when it comes to other issues, if I were you I wouldn't impugn my own credibility by doing silly stuff like that. Just looks bad.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:49:28
It does not afaik. It increases transaction capacity but it does not increase block size. If I'm wrong I'm open to hearing that but that's been my reading of the proposal. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:56:00
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:02:58
Also, generally, my sense is some in the miner community are concerned by a lack of action on the block size issue (notwithstanding capacity increases from segwit). Core is prioritizing segwit over long term solutions to the block size, and there are bound to be people who disagree with that. 
Also, it's worth mentioning Andresen's tweet about segwit was accompanied by a tweet expressing happiness that B.U is gaining support as well. It's been an acrimonious debate but segwit and algorithmic/emergent blocksize may not be mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:06:41
It doesn't really mean anything. ViaBTC has hashrate directed both at BTC and BCC, and AFAIK their customers can choose what they want to mine. It stands to reason they could find blocks on either chain.
This is just Peter Todd talking shit as usual.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:54:15
Just so you are aware, Segwit is part of a very large and very contentious political debate taking place in the Bitcoin world right now. The debate is generally between those who believe we should largely scale off chain through side chains and lightning network, etc., and those who believe we should implement a system of emergent economic action/signaling that controls the block size, which would basically amount to on chain scaling.
It's been a very rough debate and IMO is the single largest threat to bitcoins growth at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:03:38
ViaBTC has 127 peta-hashes on it, and there is more from bitcoin.com I believe. AFAIK they have about 3% hashrate right now. source 
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:20:02
In the future it will be higher. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:36:03
Yeah but bottom line the best way to increase miner profits is to increase transaction capacity on chain. And fees scaling up with Bitcoin is not feasible because it will retard user growth. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:50:19
Why do you think miners are leaving pools that support Segwit? Are they misinformed?
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:08:09
Pools are mining on both chains right now. So they are finding BTC blocks. The first BCC block is being mined right now, and will take around 90 minutes to mine.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:05:09

As others have said, the economics of holding are supportive for the price. Some think the only way to help is by spending it, but that isn't the case. Money serves many functions, and spending isn't the end all be all. Using it as a store of value helps the ecosystem too.

Miners are people just like you and me, and are just as capable of making decisions achieving a long term positive result. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:46:27
I think many people oppose SegWit because it elevates other issues above the simple scaling/capacity increase issue in terms of importance. There is a massive consensus that we need to increase the capacity of the network, but instead of making a one-off change to do just that, the community has been offered this fix that is large and complex and does 10 things other than increase capacity, and the community is extremely conservative in nature and needs certainty that any changes will be positive.
There is a strong correlation between Bitcoin price and average number of transactions, and so miners and holders prioritize increasing capacity. Now, I'm not ruling out the other changes from Segwit could be very positive (and let that debate happen!), but all of this, ALL OF THIS, needs to be viewed through the lens that the main thing the community wants is a damned capacity increase! So being offered that, but with strings attached, maybe rubs people the wrong way.
Finally, at some point we will need to have a grown up discussion about the philosophy of the block size. I personally think a market based solution determining the block size is both economically ideal, and in the spirit of bitcoin's original promise, rather than off-chain scaling solutions that will inevitably be permissioned and involve counter-party risk. But that debate will continue for years.

Many of the polls were bunk though, by oversampling Democrats, and having turnout models that presumed democrats would beat their 2008 turnout edge by 50-100 percent. There was an Arizona poll that adjusted their turnout model to D+25, and showed Hillary up 4 points. The turnout model was obviously trash, but that didn't stop headlines of "Hillary up 4 in AZ" from getting printed. 
In 2008 turnout was D+8
In 2016 it was somewhere between D+1 and R+1, I forget TBH. But most polls modeled a turnout of D+12 to +16. Garbage in, garbage out (why Nate Silver was wrong, his models used flawed polling). Idk why pollsters did this just this year, but they did. 
Long story short, I was NOT surprised by the result, and that was based on looking at the polling data and extrapolating from their bs turnout models.

To be fair though, there is no store of value money in existence that doesn't crash. Gold crashes, albeit a smaller percentage because it's market cap dwarves bitcoins. But if you're gonna get real money, that means exposure to the free market, which means uncertainty.

By holding a coin and not selling it, you are increasing its scarcity, which pushes the price up. You don't HAVE to transact with it to provide value to the ecosystem, although transacting is also valuable. But you don't have to go out of your way and do things you wouldn't ordinarily do to help Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:16:01
Think about how markets work: the market believed that there would be a fork, and some value would go onto the B2X chain, and some would stay on the BTC chain. So we can think of the BTC price BEFORE the NO2X announcement as being the COMBINED perceived value of BTC and B2X.
Now that B2X is cancelled, all of the value that would have gone onto the new chain is likely going into BCH*.
*How do I know this? It's hard to pin exact causation within markets, but consider that both BTC and BCH have had the exact same USD volume over the last 24 hours, and that the price movements of each are roughly the same (ie, BTC is down roughly $400 and BCH is up roughly $400). Source

@_date: 2017-11-11 16:29:57
It's really really obvious if you look at the numbers. A fair amount of the price of BTC had been people who supported Segwit2X. Now that Segwit 2X is cancelled, those people are selling their BTC for BCH. Both coins have nearly identical volume in USD terms, and the price movements of each are basically the same, in inverse directions. It's rare to see something so plainly pinned on one single cause.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:32:22
It’s fairly obvious to me. The price of BTC the last few weeks contained the combined perceived value of BTC and B2X. Now that there is no B2X, the comparative advantage of BCH has grown significantly, as it’s the only alternative for people who oppose BTC. 
All the money that would have gone to the B2X chain is now going, in part, to BCH. Go to coinmarketcap.com and look at the volume and price movement numbers. Both BTC and BCH have THE EXACT SAME VOLUME in the last 24 hours (around 5.3 billion USD) and the price movement in both are roughly the same in dollar terms. It’s fairly obvious to me that SOME people are selling BTC for BCH, since they had been banking on B2X. That trade, BTC-&gt;BCH, likely accounts for this entire price movement.
I’m chillin since I’m not blinded by ideology and just HODL both. There’s obviously use for both coins, let the market speak its piece.

The thing that you have to realize is that Bitcoin is an embodiment of a particular economic philosophy (libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism, laissez-faire, etc) that is *the absolute antithesis of the economic philosophy of Paul Krugman*. Paul Krugman will march to his grave fighting against bitcoin, because if bitcoin is true, then his entire economic worldview that he has spent his entire career defending is false.
The guy is probably the most famous Keynesian economist in the world, in the sense that he believes that central banks and governments have a vital **irreplaceable role** in economies. That role is to stimulate spending and boost aggregate demand through manipulation of the interest rate and the creation of moderate inflation.
Bitcoin is completely decentralized, is basically deflationary, and puts all of the anti-Keynesian theories about money to test. If the Bitcoin experiment works, Krugman is wrong. He will NEVER be a fan.
One last point 


That's something I suspect the market will solve very soon. The fee structure for bitcoin is order's of magnitude smaller, and though Bitcoin is tougher to use for Amazon or whatever compared to credit cards, I'm assuming that some of hte $400 million in VC money in the Bitcoin space is working to solve this very problem right now.
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:20:58
The reason for the animosity between most bitcoiners and PK is that the two are really on opposite sides of the spectrum when it comes to things like central banking, the role of the govt in the economy, if inflation is a good or bad thing, etc.
From my own reading of Krugman, libertarians are probably the people he has the greatest hatred for, and bitcoin is at its core an experiment in libertarian economic theory.

AFAIK the blocksize increase from Segwit is not a "backwards compatible" increase, ie it's only increased because of the way Segwit counts data and for Segwit transactions. There isn't a transaction capacity increase for non-Segwit transactions. I could be wrong, but it seems like there's some semantic shenanigans afoot on this question.
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:58:08

As a layman, I'll try helping guide you along on the things you'd be well served to explain:

Hoarding bitcoin is a perfectly rational thing to do, because unlike dollars, bitcoin has an absolute scarcity built into its issuance. Which is why many people think of it more like a commodity than as a currency.
There's the means of exchange aspect of currency, sure, but the store of value aspect is important too. Bitcoin is really good, probably like best in the world good, at the store of value aspect. It hasn't been amazing at the currency aspect, though new tech like LN may credibly change that.
To be clear, I strongly disagree with the sentiment of the comment you're replying too, which is basically neo-Keynesianism. Couldn't disagree more. And many OG bitcoiners probably feel the same way.

The point is that Bitcoin fundamentally alters the ruleset of our society. Or could at the very least.
The technology undoes the government monopoly over the money supply, and provides good financial privacy. These are all very good things to a libertarian.

The idea is that hodling increases the scarcity of Bitcoin, thus if demand is gradually increasing over time, its price goes up.

Thanks. This has long been a belief of mine, that technology changes the rules of the game, and it's why I'm so excited about Bitcoin. I don't believe, as many people do, that society progresses because we become more just or virtuous people over time. I think technology enables us to do that.
I think that Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general will provide us more liberty than we had before, but in 50 years or so, people will just assume things were always like that and take it for granted. But it's broad speculation, I know, and I have friends who have honest disagreements.

Rothbard's "For a New Liberty" is a good source for describing a libertarian approach to public infrastructure, social safety nets, etc. 
I'm not saying he's right or wrong, and your concerns are very common ones, but if you want to hear the argument from the source, there's your starting point.
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:56:55
One of the primary use cases of Bitcoin is it's hard cap of issuance. That's why all the libertarians/gold bugs/Ron Paul nutters/Federal Reserve haters were so into it in the first place. Sure you might convert to fiat at some point to buy something you need, but in the meantime it's used as a store of value.
Read this 
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:43:21
You probably didn’t mean this, but you know fiat doesn’t literally mean faith right? It means “let it be done”. 
That aside these are all excellent points. One that I would add is the obvious intrinsic utility of bitcoin. Censorship resistant payments. And it has all the characteristics of money (other than value stability). 
But the utility piece of censorship resistance is not talked about enough. That’s the core value of bitcoin that will probably never change.

Mike may disagree or not want to say this explicitly, but as a friendly public service announcement: PLEASE DO NOT USE AUTO-RENEW. It just takes your money and re-offers it at the rate you got last. One of two bad things will happen, either:
1) The rate you're asking is too high, in which case your money goes unborrowed and you aren't earning interest. Or
2) The rate you're asking is too low, in which case you are cheating yourself out of money, distorting the market pressure downward, and adding liquidity that gets in the way of other people earning interest at the correct rate. Bad Bad Bad.
Those are literally the only possibilities. So there is no good scenario that comes from auto-renew. If you don't have the time to manually manage, use cryptolend bot, poloniex lending bot, polobot, mikhadily bot. Personally I use cryptolend but to each their own.
You wouldn't "auto-sell" bitcoin for $200 less than the spot price, would you? Don't use auto-renew, it's equally irrational behavior.

@_date: 2017-05-31 02:43:58
There is no confusion, this IS answered in this roadmap.


The idea is for this to be impossible. Once again...
"To be specific, the plan is for there to be a single signal (80%) for both segwit and the base block size limit increase to 2mb"
I just don't see a possible outcome where we get 2mb and not Segwit, given the wording of the agreement. The idea is for it to be impossible to signal for one but not the other. Now I don't know if that's technically possible, but at the very least, the INTENT of the agreement is indisputable.

And then what? HF 2MB with 20% hash? You're not answering the basic question of what Jihan's long term strat is.


There is literally no hard evidence that this is true.


Jihan ***IS LITERALLY SAYING HE SUPPORTS 2MB SEGWIT COINS.*** Even if he is lying, what's his play? Seriously, what's his game plan? He has no other play than to support the NY agreement.

Look I don't know if this Silbert agreement is even real. But if you want to go straight to believing it's a conspiracy to head off BIP148 since the evidence of BIP148's inevitable success is SO OVERWHELMING, that's your prerogative.
We don't have a lot of facts to gauge support for BIP148, but the ones we do have are ones I'm going to pay attention to. If you're bothered by people linking to them that's on you.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:56:54
Yeah I need to read the COOP to see the details. The NY roadmap said no feature creep, so IDK if that means it'll get resistance (I don't even know what's different about the COOP vs any other SW 2MB HF approach at this point).
And I'm not sure I follow on the "momentum of the UASF idea" -- what's the benefit here, if we're guaranteed 83% mining hashrate? I thought the only point of the UASF was getting SW without hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:39:01
It doesn't say SW now. It says SW at 80%. Jihan is saying both lock in at the same time. This is all getting blown out of proportion by people who don't like the agreement.

Ok if you actually want to communicate with a human being, please square these two contradictory statements. What *exactly* are you suggesting Jihan is going to do? HF 2mb right now? Can't without causing a chain split. Wait for SW to activate then HF 2mb? Can't without causing a chain split (and hopefully impossible given the technical parameters of the new BIP).

Speaking as someone who's been with bitcoin since it was around $5, I've seen this movie before. You are right, the bull run won't last forever. What **YOU** may not be acknowledging, however, is that there's no way to predict the top. From your post it sounds like you're predicting $2k as the top, and it'll crash below that. I think that's your gut talking, and your gut may be wrong. In crazy bull runs it's impossible to predict the top.
I've seen bitcoin rally to $25, then crash to $2,
then rally to $100, then crash to $20,
then rally to $1100ish, then crash to $200,
Now we're rallying again and who knows the top. If it did another similar move as before, the top could be as high as $10k, then a crash to $2000. That COULD happen. But this time COULD also be different.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:45:10

Yeah that is pretty mind boggling to me. I know a guy who has made literally thousands of loans on polo, and that's just one guy, so we could be talking millions of loans opened and closed, with zero defaults. Pretty cool.
Although, with the outages lately, it's pretty disconcerting tbh. If there's an outage and some rando altcoin tanks 40% (like what happened a week ago), a default becomes more possible. I know you state no assumption of liability in this but I could see that getting messy (if there's an appearance of fault for instigating the price crash). Hopefully that's a situation that never arises -- big fan of the site.

I believe that your withdrawals will process faster/automatically if you have 2FA enabled. They also might go faster if you verify. But if you really don't want to go that route, you don't have to.
Maybe just withdraw 1% of your stash to see how it goes. I've done many withdrawals with them and they have always shown up on the blockchain as a transaction within 3-4 minutes. When you get past the wait and talk to a person, their customer service is very good.
They've had an insane influx of new users which has bottlenecked them, but as of now my opinion of them is very good. The counterparty risk (risk of them being hacked, vanishing into the night, etc) is never going to get all the way down to 0%, but they are the biggest exchange for a reason, and so far have earned my trust.

You can signal whatever you want, but if there's an overwhelming majority that agrees to a big change, it is what it is. The curious thing to see is if there's any kind of miner or node revolt in the works once all the mining pools signal support for the agreement. That's how you know if there's real disagreement, versus a tiny but vocal minority of dissenters. I don't know which it is, but I'll wait and see.

@_date: 2017-05-31 02:37:39
Who is the "we" you're referring to??? The 11% of nodes supporting UASF? The 30% of miners currently supporting Segwit?
You're speaking as if there's 90% support for Segwit-Softfork as a standalone. There is not, and attempting to do one will split the chain, and at the moment it appears you would be on the minority chain. We're all free as you said, but that's the current reality of the support.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:19:45
First of all, if this is implemented as intended, Asic boost no longer exists. Segwit = no ASICBoost. Everything else is FUD.
It's called a compromise. Segwit simply doesn't have the support necessary for a smooth rollout. 70% of the hashrate of the network is not signalling support for Segwit. Maybe the UASF would work, maybe not -- I haven't seen any meaningful metric that suggests the economic &amp; mining majority is going to join the UASF.
There are a lot of big blockers who don't want Segwit, btw, but will accept it in exchange for a 2mb HF. And as far as false flag danger/signalling in bad faith, the 2mb supporters are taking on way more risk than the SW supporters.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:21:47
This is the crucial technical question, and AFAIK, it looks like a real bitch of a problem to solve. Test time is needed for the 2mb HF because it's combined with Segwit, making it different from a solo 2mb HF (it's not just "2 lines of code" or whatever like some ppl say).
It has to be done in a totally trust-less way, and I hope they figure out a way. For what it's worth, Jeff Garzik understands the issue pretty well it seems, based on his comments in this github thread 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:08:34
I can't tell if you're responding in good faith or not, but it's a serious question.
We agree in bitcoin the coin supply limit ***should*** remain fixed for a variety of economic/political reasons. There's basically 100% agreement around that feature, for most of us it's a selling feature that got us into BTC in the first place.
The same question for blocksize remains unanswered, and it's one that's just as fraught with economic and political effects as the coin supply question. So I'm curious on Greg's view, if he's ever discussed in a ***comprehensive*** way how that question should be approached.

Roger has owned that domain since before 95% of the subs here we’re reading this subreddit. Because he’s been in the Bitcoin world longer than 95% of the people here. People talk like he’s some outsider trying to attack the thing. He’s one of the earliest adopters who has a different view on progress. Which, by the way, is how all this shit is supposed to work anyway. Competing protocols, fair game. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:44:47
It all comes down to how many people signal the UASF. If it's basically anywhere under like 80%, a chain split is almost inevitable.
The risk of a chain split has been severely minimized by supporters of the UASF, which is something I find to be both dishonest and morally reprehensible. It could be argued that *the entire point* of the UASF is to force a chain split.
Now I personally think a chain split may be in the best interest of Bitcoin, if the big blockers and small blockers can never make peace. Competing protocols and a healthy dose of free market competition may be exactly what the space needs. But who knows. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:08:24

@_date: 2017-05-08 00:20:17
To piggy back on my prior comment on auto-renew, this is actually another reason why it's good to go manual or use a bot. For the longest time I thought when someone opened a margin position, they were seeing the order book of loans (and could thus see the rates on offer).
That's NOT how it works, it's basically a market order (they take the lowest possible rate), and the default max rate that a margin trader will take is 2.000% (which is absurdly high).
So bottom line, don't adjust your rate downward by a lot to "beat the market" or whatever. Just go 0.0001 lower than the lowest if you want it filled ASAP. Or, often times there will be a ton of low volume offers at lower rates, than a sort of "Sell wall" of 10 btc or so at a higher rate. Place your offer just below the big wall.
This site is good for seeing the depth 
edit: lemme know if this makes sense or not, I'm happy to explain it further. Plus there's a LOT of irrational pricing in lending cuz ppl don't understand this stuff, so the more ppl get it and make offers tightly bound to the prevailing rate, the better off all lenders will be (until the irrationality is solved of course).
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:46:03
You should read this 
and this 
If you are lending BTC on poloniex (and maybe other exchanges) at the moment the chain splits into two currencies, you may only receive one back at the conclusion of the loan. Be careful!

Honest question, what metric, other than Reddit and twitter, makes you think UASF will succeed? There's a dearth of business and miner support. Node support is at like 12%. What am I missing? If this is free money, what makes you think so?
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:33:04
"UASF ensures there is no chain split" is Orwellian double-speak. I'm sorry, I just can't let stuff like this get said without pushing back on it. UASF nearly guarantees a chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:42:31
So it's at roughly 8% right now?
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:27:13
1. Segwit = no ASICBoost
2. From the attached link "To be specific, the plan is for there to be a single signal (80%) for both segwit and the base block size limit increase to 2mb. Segwit will start being enforced shortly after lock in, whereas 2mb blocks will be a bit farther out to ensure people have plenty of time to upgrade their nodes."
To a normal person that seems pretty clear on the intent. Now we don't have a BIP to look at yet, but I think it's pretty obvious what the plan is - Segwit activates and 2MB HF happens 6 months later.
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:59:53

Yes, most day traders lose money, that's just a fact. I was thinking about this more, and I think the best way to think about it is you're shorting BTC *against any other specific altcoin*. So not just shorting BTC against USD. If you think eth or str or doge or clam is going to go up relative to bitcoin, you can make that bet this way.

Some people just don't understand that even in a completely free system/market, there will be groups/persons/orgs that obtain a natural concentration of power, as a result of their business value, expertise, etc.
They don't understand the difference between freedom and equality. I have precisely zero problem with the NY agreement being done the way it was. People will disagree, but they are in the minority, and that's the point. The people in the NY agreement are literally the greatest stakeholders in the entire bitcoin space -- they have the most to gain from a successful compromise. And it happens to be a compromise I can live with, so win-win.
All this stuff about "muh back-room dealings" is nonsense. SW + 2MB as a compromise solution has support, and probably has for a year now.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:12:48
Read the second page of this 
"To be specific, the plan is for there to be a single signal (80%) for both segwit and the base block size limit increase to 2mb. Segwit will start being enforced shortly after lock in, whereas 2mb blocks will be a bit farther out to ensure people have plenty of time to upgrade their nodes."
If anything, the people who want the 2mb HF seem to be taking a ***FAR*** greater risk from false flagging/reneging. Any other possible conspiracy seems completely impossible given the plan laid out.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:59:51
Meh. I'd bet everything I own that it would produce a minority chain on August 1st. There's an ocean of evidence outside of this subreddit that there's not a lot of support, and some outright opposition, even from die-hard Segwit supporters.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:42:03
To be frank, I think the narrative that the NY agreement has anything to do with UASF is nonsense. The conference that the NY agreement occurred at was known about months before BIP 148 was even released, and the odds of a successful UASF, by any reasonable measure, are approaching zero.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:39:38
Oh yeah I agree with you completely. My only point was to say that because the base blocksize increase is being combined with SW, that increases the complexity and thus the testing required. I understand that a 2mb HF would require testing as well, but it's an idea that's been being developed for literally years (classic etc).

The rate given is a daily rate. You don't get any compounding effect unless you are closing out loans (and re-loaning out the new money you've made). So while a loan is open, interest accumulates at a constant rate.

For me the key phrase of the OP link is this:


I read some of how they want to achieve this with blockheight, but I'm still skeptical. But if they found a way to do it, then God bless 'em, let's do it.
Unfortunately the people doing the dev work have to contend with the fact that this is a ***political*** compromise, whether they like it or not. Hopefully the COOP can do what it claims to do. I'm remaining cautiously optimistic.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:43:54
Wtf? Can we just communicate in plain english?
The guy said "we're on our way to one (a solution)". How does he know that? There's literally no meaningful indicator to suggest sufficient support for UASF, no exchange support, no miner support, small node support. I'm not precluding it from happening in the future, but saying "we're on our way to activating BIP148" is speculative.
That's not concern trolling it's accurately describing where we are.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:48:37
I honestly don't even know what ppl are talking about when they say centralization of mining. There are tons of mining companies, each with different politics and views. If it was centralized you'd think they would overwhelmingly support one approach, instead of being split 40/30 between EC and SW.
It's a boogieman and fortunately a lot of ppl see through it. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:00:57
It's understandable to be confused by this issue. One of the selling points of soft forks is their backwards compatibility, and thus no chain split. But as others have said this UASF would cause a split if the miners and some users don't go along (which at the moment seems likely). It comes down to semantics -- they soft fork, and if everyone else soft forks too, then no chain split, WOOHOO! A silly way of putting it.
The bottom line is any contentious change to the network, no matter how it is deployed, has the potential to split the network. And the other bottom line that some find difficult to accept, is that Segwit is a contentious change, and some groups would prefer a blocksize increase.

As far as 2mb HF is concerned with effect to full nodes, that's essentially a political question, and there's obviously broad consensus to make that tradeoff.

Jumping in cuz I'm curious on your view:
How do you answer the following question, in a general sense: 
What ***should*** the blocksize be? Not today, or next week. But at any given time. Like a unified theory of blocksize.
I'm unsure if you've ever written/published a comprehensive view on that. And outside the context of today's debates, this is a question that will never go away. Perhaps L2 really is the answer, but while it still looks like vaporware to most people, it's an unsatisfactory answer, even if true.

This is so so sooooo dishonest. Did you even read the roadmap? It says one signal for both SW and 2mb HF, and the HF happens 6 months after 80% is reached. All of the big blockers are bitching, thinking that SW could happen and then nodes renege and no 2mb HF.
You should read the roadmap email, because I'm hoping you're not spreading FUD on purpose, you're just misinformed. If you STILL say this is a grand conspiracy after reading that, you're view isn't credible.

If you actually believe that, just be careful with your money. Doing a chain split from BIP148 with less than 50% support could cause loss of funds. The risks have been hidden by bad actors.

How it makes the borrower money? Yes, it is used to short Bitcoin or to buy other altcoins. BTC is the primary currency on Poloniex, so if you want to margin trade you're going to be borrowing BTC. I'm not sure what else ppl can do other than short BTC, I don't really do margin trading, just lending.

Exactly, talk of oligarchy is nonsense. This represents a critical mass, 83% of hashrate, all the largest businesses (except Blockstream).

For the record, Greg Maxwell has serious problems with BIP 148, and the tyrannical mindset that Luke uses to justify it. For further reading, 
Choice excerpt from Greg (fyi he isn't talking about BIP148 here overall except where noted, he's discussing orphaning), "It's one thing to argue that some disruption is strictly needed for
the sake of advancement, it's another to see yourself fit as judge,
jury, and executioner to any that does not jump at your command.
(which is exactly the tone I and at least some others extract from
your advocacy of these changes and similar activity around BIP148).
I for one oppose those changes strongly."

Your post is really just driving home the point that you don't understand how open source software development works. If Segwit2X is broadly adopted, Core can just merge it, and then be in the exact same position then as they are now. BTC1 isn't "taking it away and not giving it back". Just because they might complete one successful software addition does not mean that they then have control of bitcoin development in perpetuity. Relax mate.

There's something amiss here.
This comment seems to be suggesting that UASF would somehow **prevent** a split from occurring. The result of a UASF would be **precisely** that a split occurs. I don't know how that impacts things with exchanges or whatever, but keep things straight, a UASF has a near 100% chance of splitting bitcoin into two currencies, similar to ETH and ETH classic.

Hmmm thanks for the response.
1. I hope LN gets here ASAP, because the longer it doesn't exist, the more we will get either a) bigger blocks or b) decreasing market share/use in btc relative to alts. It's just simple economics, alts will eat our lunch so long as fees are high.
2. I read the github thread on compatibility, and while I get the technical argument for bit 1, it's right there in the WG charter to do bit 4. My understanding is that some want to do it this way: if a node wants to upgrade to activate Segwit, they need to make an upgrade that will make them signal for the future HF ***by default***. So even though you can't control future bad actors who renege, at the very least the default for nodes who just set and forget will be to follow the HF. If any of that's wrong feel free to let me know.
The political aspect cannot be separated here. Segwit2x is very clearly the fastest way to activate Segwit, without a chain split, without all the risks, baggage, and economic damage of the UASF. But the 2mb ppl need to be sufficiently confident in Segwit 2x to activate. That's how I'm seeing it at the moment.
Btw, agreed on possibly more time needed for the 2mb HF. I just don't want to see a chain split.

Let's use proof of Reddit comments instead.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:44:40
What Jeff wrote was already clear enough IMO. He shouldn't have even needed the clarification, but when people are accusing you of something as awful as ***secretly preserving ASICBOOST***, you kinda need to spell it out for them. It really takes a ***purposeful misinterpretation of what he wrote*** to go from "we are doing segwit first, other stuff later" to "I'm magically writing a new version Segwit that doesn't effect ASICBOOST in any way, something that has never existed before, but I will now create out of thin air."
Greg's own comment in the thread: "The agreement as stands already bans segwit incompatible covert asicboost: It says the signers will immediate deploy segwit. And segwit breaks the sqrt optimization for covert asicboost." Which is funny, because that comment kind of makes his starting concern a moot point.
The real issue here is bad blood, zero trust, and assumption of bad faith. I obviously can't address all the bad blood of all the devs in one reddit thread, but it's a big problem moving forward. You have to be able to [assume good faith]( 
If every move that you're making is being twisted into some horrible thing, that vastly slows down the collaborative process. So in this case, I would not call this an example of Greg being productive.

Thank you. 100% of the discussion from Maxwell, Adam Back, and Luke JR has felt like intentional sabotage to me. I really just can't fathom what their motives are to disparage an agreement that ***so obviously is what the community wants, and has the most support of any agreement, ever***.
To be frank, it impugns their motives.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:41:01
One of the biggest untold benefits of Segwit2X is that by the time of the HF, it will lock in Segwit on 100% of the network, guaranteed, via hard fork. This means we will get 100% of the capacity increase available via Segwit, rather than an unknown amount, which is the result of a soft fork deployment.
Jeff discusses in detail the pros and cons of soft forks and hard forks in the talk, and if you support Segwit, having it eventually deployed via hard fork is a big benefit.

There are a few, and the debate over what to do has basically caused a civil war in the Bitcoin community. The most likely is Segwit + a 2MB Hard fork. Both would solve the fee problem at least in the medium term. But it's an extremely contentious issue.

Sure thing. On mobile so it'll be shorter. Gives more data than any other bot I know of. You have a dashboard with average Kent, usage rate, average interest rate, total earned. The guy running it is on the slack channel and he has added a lot of features we asked for, including max duration of loans for high interest rates (so nobody is lending on August 1 in case of a chain split).
I'd just say try it out. The server time to poloniex has been slow lately but that's on Polos end afaik. Been using for two months and am very satisfied.

Do you have 2 factor authentication enabled? Anecdotally, that makes withdrawals go through much faster. When it isn't enabled, there's a higher chance that a human has to look at the withdrawal and approve it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:52:31
Is there even a version of Segwit in existence that **does not** disable Covert ASICBOOST? Or are you referring to theoretical code that doesn't exist? I'm not aware of any, which is why Garzik's meaning was clear to me from the start -- ASICBOOST fixes from Segwit remain, as they are part of the charter, and extra fixes above and beyond should be discussed, but will be done later.
My biggest takeaway from this is the astonishingly low amount of trust between devs, in general. I understand your negative feelings about Jeff and won't judge them since I am not in a position to, but I hope the people making this future BIP happen can [assume good faith]( moving forward.

Do you know how crazy it sounds to think that you know better than the 99% of the network hashrate that IS NOT supporting bip 148 at this time?
The libertarian mindset built bitcoin. The idea that you live and let live, and let other people conduct their affairs how they see fit, and do what's best for them. Goddamn the mental gymnastics people go through to think BIP 148 is both a good idea AND best for miners, in spite of an OVERWHELMING amount of evidence that they don't want it, is just breathtaking. August 2nd can't come soon enough.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:48:36
A more apt metaphor is "how many 787's should Boeing build next year?" 
It's at least partially an economic question, not just a technical one. At what point do nodes become "centralized"? I oppose the outcome to be clear, but there's by no means an objective answer to "node count is decentralized" and "node count is centralized". These are tradeoffs and preferences. It's not like there's an agreed upon blocksize that would "break" Bitcoin. So appeals to technical authority have their place, but knowing your domain matters too. 
Hopefully LN obviates the whole issue but man am I sick of saying that....

Precisely. Even the very pro-Segwit Greg Maxwell said "if UASF had 10x more support than it does now, I'd consider supporting it". They know it's totally pie in the sky. There's a bunch of wood-roaming LARPers around here who think they're Yankee Doodle fighting for freedom or something, and have no idea how hard it would be to do something like this.
That's why meetings of business and miners are precisely what can happen to push a change. They may not represent enough support to push it through, but it's the best shot we've got. And it sure as shit beats a rag-tag bunch of Redditors.

I know it's frustrating, but you came in at a period of exponential growth for them, and they are on ramping a shit load of people to handle the demand.

@_date: 2017-06-27 19:43:20
I don't know the politics/details/possible downsides on B, and C is pretty broad/undefined, but you and I both know that doing A is a pretty difficult sell and against the "no-feature-creep" rule. I know there's a lot of great stuff that could be added to a hard fork, but getting consensus for Segwit and 2MB base size was hard enough. Maybe you are in a different position from me as an *actual* github contributor, and maybe valuable stuff can get added in. But there's a real danger that if we add too much then the signatories will look at it and see the changes as a violation of the agreement.
It's too bad but we both know we're operating in a zero trust environment, everything has to be trust but verify.


You'd have to ask the signers, but it seems like they are. I just want the network to be valuable and used.
This whole episode has revealed a lot of tension between the business community and the dev community. And the VERY interesting dynamic at play here is that neither side is fixed -- businesses can vanish due to competition, and devs can be routed around if they aren't producing code that the bitcoin network/users want. I've got my own views but we just have to wait and see what happens.

@_date: 2017-06-21 20:17:57
Yes, July activation is a soft fork. But AFAIK, when the HF for block size increase occurs, Segwit will be active on the blockchain post-hard-fork. In the video it discusses the downside of soft forks (one of the biggest being that the economic impact of Segwit as SF is hard to predict, because we can't predict it's adoption rate), and so these downsides are obviated.
The video was filmed in April so he does not directly make this point, as Segwit2X did not exist yet, but he does repeatedly state that he believes Segwit as HF is a better approach for governance reasons.
I am not certain about the HF activation logic, so if an expert wants to chime in feel free.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:02:33
I can't give you an exact number, but yes, in my observation. I used to watch the Segwit and BU hash every day and you would see fluctuates like this as big as 8% on a specific pool.
The effect could play itself out as you're describing, but this does not yet rise to the level of data. Need to wait 1-2 more days to be sure.
No worries if this post was made in good faith, it's all good.

What Adam is saying is incoherent. No one is advocating Segwit in 4-6-9 months. Jeff Garzik is working on the NY agreement which plans to bring at least 80% hashrate support for Segwit on July 21, in like 45 days. 
I don't see this as helpful or productive.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:36:28
Has anyone even come close to proposing such a thing? How does the BIP you listed do it?
The missing piece of the puzzle for me is what force would push the blocksize lower? I was pro BU until I started thinking about that -- what would prevent the blocksize from rapidly increasing? I guess nodes vote for it to be lower, miners vote higher, I guess? That remains a big question for me. 
In general I agree with the principle that this needs to be decided in a decentralized or "free market" manner, but I haven't a clue how to do it on a technical level.

The bottom line is that the working group for Segwit+2MB is focused on accomplishing Segwit and a 2mb HF. They are trying to avoid feature creep. So Jeff was attempting to clarify what, if anything, needs to be done beyond Segwit to disable ASICBOOST, because that would be prioritized.
It's an invitation for discussion, not a declaration of policy. These threads are rife with concern trolls trying to cast shade on literally any progress that doesn't perfectly conform to their preferred solution, so the mere discussion of the topic gets blown out of proportion.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:21:03
Yep the no access to withdrawals and trades is standard with any bot. Make sure you set up the API on your poloniex account when setting it up to NOT ALLOW that stuff, that's how you ensure you're good to go. Hope it goes well for you!
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:12:45
Working totally fine for me. Do you have 2FA enabled on your account? If 2FA is not enabled, that increases the odds of human approval being required for the withdrawal, slowing things down.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:17:53
Even beyond miners, the OP is still extremely misleading -- that graph counts up BTC companies and assigns each one a "1" value, so Coinbase and "Bitbond.com" each are valued equally.
Much more accurate to use "enable weighting", which aligns with most predictions of support: Segwit 84%, EC 23%, UASF/BIP148 5%.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:28:48
Just for the record I've only had good experiences with them, never had a single issue with a withdrawal, got verified fast, and support was good. And I think polo has ppl on here talking to ppl, so it's not like there's no forum to talk to them. I'm not grieving over losing the trollbox.

@_date: 2017-06-21 16:44:02


You have just as much of an epistemological burden to show, with reason, why a 1MB block is optimal. This article does not do so in any way shape or form. Obviously the overwhelming advantage goes to the status quo policy due to how difficult it is to achieve consensus, but from a purely rational perspective, there is just as much of a burden on you to explain why 1MB is a good blocksize. Why not 100KB? Why not 2MB?


The word "hastily" is used subjectively. Your argument for a 1MB blocksize is undefined.
I understand your argument fully, that Bitcoin can function as a settlement protocol, and it's low value transactions can be fulfilled by altcoins, which leads to a happy equilibrium in the mempool. But the bigger question still remains: Bitcoin is a settlement protocol for how many? For the population of Lichtenstein? For the population of Detroit? The whole USA? 
Right now the 1MB is a purely arbitrary answer to that question, because we have not, as of yet, fully solved the question of the optimal tradeoff between blocksize, and burden on nodes. It is an artificial limit, which, though useful, is certainly not optimal.
I want us to discover the blocksize that would create the most valuable Bitcoin network possible. I have no idea what that number is, and to be honest I don't think anyone does.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:57:20
Great interview and helped me get a clearer bird's-eye view of the whole situation. His biggest idea is that there are 5 key groups in the bitcoin world: miners, exchanges, payment service businesses, developers, and wallet holders/users. And if anyone can get a proposal that gets support from 3, and hopefully 4 out of 5, then it's game on. Everyone claims absolute power, when in reality no one has it.
Skip to 38:00 if you want a kind of summary: he says "we're going to get all of the above, we're going to get an activation of Segwit, we're going to get an increase to the base blocksize in addition to Segwit's blockweight increase, we're going to see a reformatting of the blockheader in order to introduce new features like extra nonces for miners, we might see new tx format, Schnorr signatures, UTXO sets"
Struck a pretty hopeful tone which is nice to see. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:38:45
The idea that blocksize should never change is a total farce, and I honestly view anyone who claims that with suspicion. I'm not saying that to get personal, I'm saying that to convey the ridiculousness of the idea. Satoshi knew it would change, the question is how much, and by what mechanism do we decide?
You shouldn't centrally dictate the supply of everything. Supply and demand can both dynamically move. The whole reason San Francisco is unaffordable is because of government restricting supply of housing.
I'm not advocating unlimited blocksize to be clear. The bottom line is that unless we get 2nd layer VERY SOON, Bitcoin will lose an enormous amount of utility from high fees. If a transaction costs $10, the use cases become narrower and narrower.
If LN makes small blocks optimal then great, but it has to actually happen first.

I think it was thought out well enough, it's just extremely complicated technically.

@_date: 2017-06-07 02:04:16
Honest question -- what blocksize is unacceptable to you? At what blocksize does bitcoin become broken and full nodes become centralized?
Because I'm guessing that number is way higher than 2mb, and if all we need for infinite scaling is LN, and all we need for LN is Segwit, then this is an acceptable compromise.

If anything at this point I think the Segwit part of it has a 95% of happening. It's the 2mb HF 6 months later that feels uncertain. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:20:20
Yeah I hate that.
Kinda like how I hate when people propose a soft fork and present it as being safe, without pointing out that it could cause a catastrophic chain split by activating without hardly any miner support.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:51:55
It is not Segwit that 95% of the hashrate is supporting. 95% is supporting Segwit2X. Some are stomaching a blocksize increase in order to get Segwit. Some are stomaching Segwit to get a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:37:21


I agree with this. In the absence of layer 2 though, surely you see a big problem with fees tripling in a month right? So if we can leverage the NY agreement, which has achieved the highest amount of hash support and presumably node support ***by far*** when compared to other proposals, surely it's a tradeoff worth making to get Lightning rolling right?
Asking because I know who you are and respect your knowledge of the issue. I used to be pro-EC but have learned more about the risks and would now describe myself as pro-Segwit2X-and-let's-see-what-happens. Maybe you aren't, and if not, I'm interested in hearing your perspective (absent populist "but muh closed doors" type stuff, the overwhelming business consensus is a crucial constituency to consider).
Certainly Bitcoin's uniqueness derives from the structure of the full node network, but it's utility is derived from it's ability to be moved around.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:49:12


Could you clarify what you mean by this?
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:21:49
Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:19:05
Agreed. In a way this is extremely exciting, because of it's excellent use as a store of value, but also extremely worrying, because it's use case as a means of exchange/remittance/micro-transactions, have evaporated before our eyes.
Speaking as someone who got involved in 2012, I think there was a ton of optimism and idealism back then, and we didn't realize that not all use cases of Bitcoin were going to be equally feasible. I would love BTC to be useable by the poor, in small transactions, etc, but the hurdles are very real. Here's hoping by the Fall fees are low again.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:50:37
This is all true and has always been true, but a consensus change is becoming more and more likely due to rising fees. Just look at a two year graph of miner fees and you can see that a change looks more plausible. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:46:30
I didn't hear a precise answer but I think it's either 1) Bitcoin was here first and has a network effect or 2) it's decentralized, immutable, secure, old, etc. Or of course a combination of the two.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:28:37
Interesting, thanks for the info and insight.
What's the problem with just letting nodes and miners vote against each other? Most nodes would vote for it to stay low so they aren't cut out by tech costs. I guess maybe that's gameable . . .
Anywho, gonna go read BIP105 thx.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:50:47
Oh cool, I may actually learn something here. I'm not sure yet if I agree or not, but your argument makes some sense and I'm definitely interested in the topic so I'm down to keep discussing.
So I'm trying to view charts on blockchain.info to make sense of this right now. I know that [average block size]( and [average # of transactions]( has been steadily increasing over time, in a pretty smooth line.
If what you're saying were true, that miner revenue is basically static with non-full blocks, then data would support that. But the [cost per transaction]( and more importantly, the [miner revenue]( aren't static. Now the spikes obviously correspond to the price variance, but even then, there's a clear uptrend between 2013 and 2017, higher highs and higher lows.
So it's not a binary thing, where if blocks are less than full, suddenly net miner revenue tanks. It seems to keep going up as we have more total transactions (though it's very hard to separate the effects of price movements in 2013, etc)
Of course with a 2mb HF fees would likely crash short term, but long term it seem clear miner revenue would increase. Feel free to change my view, I'm enjoying the discussion.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:01:21
I think Garzik deserves some serious credit too, for focusing on code and not giving a shit about ppls egos or any of that bullshit. He sees this is what's best for Bitcoin, so he's gonna reach out and make it work. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:31:40
I post on r/btc a fair bit and I'm extremely satisfied with Segwit2X. You could make the exact same accusation of this sub, that it hates Segwit2x. It's just a vocal minority.
I think the vast majority of people are perfectly fine with the compromise, and then there's a minority on either side who think the other side will destroy bitcoin, and then there are straight up astroturfers on both sides who are actively working to drum up FUD against this proposal. That's the way I see it at least.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:40:44
Right, what I mean by the above comment is that assuming we get the HF after the SF, the HF would make Segwit on the entire chain, completely ending ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:57:54
So wait a second . . . if people transact in their "UASF coins" between August 1 and November 15, and UASF doesn't get 51% of the hashrate, their coins disappear and the UASF chain gets re-orged by the legacy chain?

Good to know. Makes me much less sympathetic to BU/EC (and I used to be an ardent supporter). The overall goal, of a self-correcting system that achieves equilibrium WRT blocksize, I would hope could achieve a large degree of community support. It's the technical barriers that are tough to solve.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:54:55
This is really an incomplete argument. The author does clearly explain that the basic tradeoff is between overall network capacity, and the security and decentralization of the network, but he is begging this simple question, which remains unanswered by his article:
**What** ***should*** **the capacity of the network itself be? By what means shall we decide?**
At what point does the network become "centralized" and "insecure"? Surely the author would agree that the network would be EVEN MORE secure if the blocksize limit were 500kb, right? What about 100kb? Would the network's "value" be even greater at that point, due to it's increasing security and decentralization?
So the tradeoff remains, and the means by which we determine the optimal space within that tradeoff remains elusive.
He makes a good point that users would use altcoins as a relief valve or alternative when fees are too high, thus creating an equilibrium in the fee market, but his argument that this somehow validates the value of the BTC network, leading to a higher price, is not fully fleshed out. Is the network dramatically more valuable if blocksize is 100kb, and only tx's with $100 fees are viable? The logic escapes me.
Deciding the optimal capacity of the network is ultimately an economic question, but until we have really REALLY convincing data on the relationship between blocksize and security of the network, and can quantify that in an economically intelligible way, solving this tradeoff will continue to be an elusive task.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:29:10
Care to clarify? At what point are full nodes "no longer being used to verify incoming transactions"? Where's the line?

When people compromise shit gets done. I know you might be one of those people in La La land who thinks the UASF is going to work and won't cause a ton of damage to the network, but it's nowhere near the support required to work in the near or medium term. If you want Segwit, the NYA is the only feasible option. That's why politics matter.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:29:14
Wow this is legitimately big news. This question has been mentioned many types on the github repo and this is the first affirmative statement from Garzik on the matter. Really really really good news. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:08:42
Agree. People will see, for 10 days prior, that BIP91 is going to trigger. It would be insane for 1-10% of nodes to fork off and abandon the main chain when their goals are already going to be achieved. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:18:34
He literally just answered your question.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:59:09
This isn't just discussing a potential problem. If it was only that I'd have more patience for it. This is accusing a person, who is asking for collaboration, coordination, and cooperation, of very serious wrongdoing and less than honorable intentions. And the accusation just doesn't make sense from the original post. 
I'm glad you have some optimism, I do too, even amidst the infighting. I hope we can all come together and make something happen for the good of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:20:04
Oh sure, but this gets into the question of "what is Bitcoin"? Is it a store of value or a means of exchange? So far in terms of observable real world history, it's behaved WAY WAY WAY better as a store of value, and may continue to do so. But nobody really knows, it's the type of thing where the market decides, and we all have to wait and see what happens.

He seems to have a holistic view, and knows that both segwit and base blocksize increase are going to happen. The main thing he seemed to emphasize was the importance of doing both safely, without splitting the network.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:30:13
I think we are approaching a change. I'd be surprised if we didn't have segwit in 6 months. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:03:04


No, but there are plenty of things to do to nudge lazy miners and nodes in a preferred direction, which is exactly what is happening. We can like it or not like it, but that's the agreement that was made.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:01:51


If you want to determine the network capacity that would lead to the Bitcoin network being as valuable as possible, then yes you do share that burden. 
If you don't care about the future value of Bitcoin and view increased altcoin replacement usage as de facto "scaling" (as you imply in the untrue statement "Bitcoin as a settlement system scales indefinitely"), then you do not share that burden.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:38:20
Segwit by itself will result in a price increase, but short to medium term if there's a supermajority of hashrate against BIP148 (80% or more) it's a near certainty that we'll see a big market disruption and a lower price. The UASF chain will be very difficult to use, on top of the fact there's been a chain split.
Again, long term Segwit definitely means +$$$, but if miners are united or nearly united against it, things will be bumpy for a while. To suggest otherwise is doing a disservice to newbies who don't understand the risks and dynamics at play. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:14:38

@_date: 2017-06-06 20:56:25
For the record, it's closer to 50% support for bigger blocks, since 7% or so is signaling for BIP 100.

@_date: 2017-06-18 04:11:18
Right it's just a network change supported by 90% of the miners and an overwhelming majority of Bitcoin related businesses.

What about it is unclear to you? I'm mostly in the camp that it's pretty goddamn clear, and the confusion is either from ppl lacking understanding, or wanting to intentionally sow doubt. 
For example, the big hullabaloo over ASICBOOST was 100% fud, in my opinion. The accusation that Garzik was somehow advocating or paving the way for Segwit without disabling ASICBOOST, was incoherent even within the accusation's own logic, out of character from public statements made prior, obviously politically impossible, and disproved by the original issue thread. But that didn't stop thousands of redditors from reading the posts about it and at least some of them being misinformed by it.
Read the source documents. The technical details may be a shit show, but the intent of the NYA is pretty crystal clear. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:02:15
Source on hashrate for UASF?
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:43:32
God I hope this is true (about LN). And I say that as a big blocker. I'm not a big blocker first, I just want bitcoin to fucking work again, so whatever makes micro payments/remittances/ possibly again, I support. 
And agreed on a dynamic blocksize up or down. A crucial question I believe is, how do we architect a structure that pressures the size downward, as well as upward? We need competing pressures to find an equilibrium for blocksize, and the economic solution is evasive.

@_date: 2017-06-02 20:20:14
Thanks, good point. I wish there were a site that tracked average satoshi per byte over time. Because that's how we can look at this on an apples to apples basis.
I'm ending this way more confused than I started haha. I mean, transactions are rising linearly, and so things that increase transactions increase revenue, right? I'm still just unsure if, for example, miner revenue is the same whether blocks are 30% full or 80% full (which is your argument, correct?)
I'm honestly curious what would happen to net miner revenue if there were full blocks another year. Disastrous for Bitcoin, but would give us more data on the economics. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:03:54
His post contributes precisely 0 to the conversation, and worsens it in several ways. He's misrepresenting Garzik's goals and intent, and blaming him for the effect of 148, even though he has nothing to do with it. If anything, a successfully coded proposal for Segwit2X may be precisely the thing that prevents a BIP148 fuelled messy chain split.
If Adam should be venerated he should act and speak venerably.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:51:21
Exactly right. Miners generally support 2mb HF because it means more net revenue for them, relative to Segwit, because of the tx discount. The incentives are really easy to understand, no conspiracies required.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:40:56




Who makes money off the Lightning network? Is it just another permissioned network with a centralized group controlling its access? Asking because I don't really know. I certainly hope it works, because without it, this problem seems a lot more unsolvable.
My hope then is we get Segwit2X, since it's political the easiest to accomplish, and if it's true that Lightning will solve the fee and decentralization issue, then Segwit is basically all we need to obviate the need for more blocksize HF's in the future, right?
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:14:58
Came here to basically say this. Hodling increases the scarcity of Bitcoin and drives the price up.

@_date: 2017-06-05 03:53:11
I can't upvote this enough. This is the attitude that's going to save Bitcoin and keep it moving forward.
A few weeks ago I was basically just pro-BU/EC, but at this point I've been so inspired by the positive movement by Segwit2X, that I'm 100% in favor of that agreement (even if it means no Emergent Consensus down the road). Segwit and a safe HF down the road will solve the problem and give us time for more complete scaling solutions.
Cheers, thanks for approaching this whole thing with an open mind, as I am also trying to do.
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:33:10


WHAT?? Have you not read anything that I've written? You haven't even come close to showing that there's no valid argument to scale.
Here, I'll go first.
Argument for scaling: If the Bitcoin blocksize is 2MB instead of 1MB, more transactions can be settled onchain, leading to more transactions, leading to more users, leading to increased adoption, leading to a more valuable network, leading to a higher Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:09:47

Indeed indeed. I think that EVERYONE, no matter their bias/interest/angle, underestimates the power of inertia when it comes to bitcoin. It's something that's just very very very hard to fuck with.
I've been bullish before and I'm just as bullish as I've ever been.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:56:56
It's literally a 51% attack, but some people cheerlead it because it's a change they want. And there's now a guaranteed way to get Segwit, and ban any form of ASICBOOST (as publicly stated by Jihan), if people can accept a 2mb HF as a compromise. But even still some would rather force a chain split and hope for a 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:44:30
Indeed I did see that. I just did a quick count of the last 50 blocks myself and I think that I came to 74%. Plus BTCC is on record supporting SW2X. I'll just check again in a day and see what bubbles up. Cheers.

@_date: 2017-06-05 00:22:29
Agree -- the only change I am looking for is for big brand companies (Coinbase, Bitpay, pools, etc) to come out and say they'll support it. Absent that, it's totally ignorable.
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:23:07


I did say **full** 2mb blocks. I get that revenue would collapse in the short term, but we'd approach full again. And surely full 2mb blocks will provide double-ish revenue, relative to full 1mb blocks, no? In other words, fee per transaction is same, but volume of transactions is doubled.
I'm approaching this with an open mind and appreciate the discussion because I see the underlying ***strangeness*** of the economics, but I am very wholly unconvinced that a fee market is something desirable for Bitcoin. If a good is prohibitively expensive, people will just use any number of substitutes to meet their needs.
Perhaps I can move things forward with a question I asked Greg Maxwell and haven't yet gotten a response: what, in a very general and abstract sense, ***should*** the blocksize be, from a purely economic standpoint? In other words, if we are going to declare a finite supply of blockspace, by what means shall we determine the optimal amount, economically? Because even if we don't solve that question with Segwit2X, we'll need to soon.
Appreciate the discussion, thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:21:58
It's a reasonable point of view, but I really do think this time is different with the NY agreement. It's the only proposed protocol upgrade that has not just a majority of hash rate, but a shitload more than a majority (83%). And those businesses probably control a ton of validating nodes as well.
If the working group can actually craft code that complies with the spirit of the agreement, I really think that that's the once that's gonna happen.

@_date: 2017-06-03 23:26:44
So I generally have fallen into the big block camp historically, but if we get Segwit2x, and then we get lightning, and tx throughput issues are decisively solved, then yes, EC will be as good as dead. EC/BU survives as long as lightning remains just an abstraction to most people (no matter how meritorious it is in reality).
If the scaling roadmap of small blockers is actually doable, then making Segwit2x is the best way to prove it once and for all. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:11:14
I think this stems from a misconception of fees with regard to the blocksize. Back when fees were 5 cents, a tiny fraction of the 1mb blocksize limit was being used, so you could think of it as a 100kb block, etc. In that context it isn't accurate to think of it as "1mb blocks". And as we've gradually moved to full blocks, the fee revenue has increased. But now that blocks are full, we've hit a limit, both to tx throughput and miner revenue.
So long story short, yes, a 2mb full block will provide roughly double the fee revenue to miners compared to now. If we had full 2mb blocks today, that means fees would be the exact same to us users, but the total volume of tx's would be double.
That's why we were never going to get only Segwit or only 2mb HF, there are competing financial interests here, and so the only solution is a political compromise.
The other thing is the price of Bitcoin seems to grow with a growing transaction rate, so any self-interested long term thinking miner will support tx rate growth.
