I took a critical thinking class once and the first thing they taught was that reciting the name of a fallacy is not an argument. Though that's a bit different than the fallacy fallacy (which is truly a fallacy- an assumption that a conclusion is false because one argument claiming it rests on an untrue assumption).

Right, and then whatever they do with their block size, Core will know to do the opposite.

The last post on was 17 hours ago, has a response from Kraken support (though I now see that was posted 3 minutes ago), and all the "chaos" posts were from one disgruntled dude, while the site was offline and before anybody knew what the issue was. Kraken has been fine been fine for me since it came back online.
Honestly there isn't enough activity on that sub to ever constitute "commotion."

I haven't done any much work in cybercrime law, but what I've done with cyberbullying laws for a client convinced me that any time you do something unexpected with a computer, you've violated the letter of some law.
If you cost enough people enough money in the process to attract the attention of a prosector, then that perception becomes reality.

You probably *do* violate some T&amp;C, but I'm talking particularly about harassment statutes that have been specifically extended to cover electronic communications. No private agreements involved.
I presume, but am too lazy to do the five minutes of Googling required, that similar extensions have been made to mail/telephone fraud statutes that would practically make it a crime to sneeze while emailing.

In substance, you don't, because in order to enforce that patent against someone who you need to reduce the innovation to practice, a/k/a invent it. Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g), but even post-AIA it's first-*inventor*-to-file. I suppose we could argue about whether the white-paper constitutes full disclosure or prior art (it doesn't) for AIA purposes.

This follows my theory that the quality of a residence is inversely proportional to how fancy of a name it has. E.g. "Belmont Estates" is probably a shitty trailer park, and "The Crick" is a subdivision with $500K homes in a great school district.

I actually think most folks are *under*-estimating how soon this will come. Human beings are the worst obstacle for driverless cars... All it takes is a few Senators getting repeatedly cut off by us sacks of spinal fluid before we get a big compromise "ban drivers, pay to replace their cars with self-drivers" bill.
First you'll see impeding enforced harsher against human drivers working self-driving cars. Then you'll see "no overtaking unless automated." Fleshies are going to be demonized the same way smokers have been. It's only a matter of time. Inb4 "self-driving cars are a human right!"

The "angle" of increase is half dependent on the length of the horizontal axis, and you have to max it out, plus 1.5 years of almost 0 transactions, to get that 45-degree angle...
I mean yeah it's been increasing, but the 1 year chart is *maybe* 5 degrees?

He put two spaces between the sentences (right click-&gt; View Source). HTML automatically disregards the second space.
That monster.
He also ~~renamed the HTML page's extension ".jpg"~~ (see below) which is like a magic trick for 13-year-olds.

Property lawyer here. While a government imprimatur would be nice, there can be off-record transfers of property. They just aren't valid again third-party purchasers without notice.
The simplest circumstance where this occurs is in corporate mergers/separations where the recording of transfers of all real property of the corporation is determined (by the corporation) to be cost-prohibitive. That's usually considered sloppy (by me, anyway). 
A more analogous example would be how MERS handles off-record mortgage assignments and bundling. They have a shit reputation, but the concept itself is sound: record a gatekeeping mortgage that adds a security interest to your off-record electronic system, then trade it off-record with people who all agree to re-convey the interest of necessary (e.g., for foreclosure in a state that requires the foreclosing entity to hold the mortgage). 
So tl;dr, in most US jurisdictions no law change is needed (my opinion, anyway). But express sanction would make everybody a lot more comfortable.

I don't think colored coins alone could capture the terms of a property conveyance, but I suppose I don't know much about them and I could be convinced otherwise. 
A smart contact us partway there because it can capture some forms of non-performance. It could revert on nonpayment of a lease or mortgage, for example. However, there are other forms of interest transfers (remainers, reversionary interests, etc.) that have one foot in documentation, and another in reality. A smart contact can't know about all conditions to an interest, so for the time being there has to be a "dumb" contact between all successor holders of the property interest, agreeing to honor those transfer rules; or, as the case may be, agreeing not to.

MERS is a nominee for the lender, meaning they are the mortgagee (they own and trade the security) while the lender services the note. 
In your example, a DAO would manage the fee, while a landlord manages the lease. If the landlord requires ownership of the fee to evict (which I doubt in my jurisdiction) then a mechanism would have to be written into the gatekeeper deed, and every off-record transfer, to reconvey the fee when the lease is violated. So it's actually the on-record owner (the gatekeeper) getting the off-record owner to re-convey him the fee.
