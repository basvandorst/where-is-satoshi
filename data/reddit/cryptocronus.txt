It's not too late if you can still afford 1 bitcoin.  There are only at most 21M bitcoins and 7 billion people on earth.  If everyone was thinking of buying 1 bitcoin just like you, they couldn't.
There's only enough bitcoin for on average 0.003BTC per person.  A lot less if you consider how many millions of bitcoin are lost and will be lost due to key loss.

I bet a good chunk of it is coming from MMM.  I joined to see how it worked in relation to bitcoin and they provide guides on how to buy bitcoin using localbitcoin and bitquick.

well for one the dwave computer only solves very specific optimization problems.  they'd have to somehow transform computing a sha256 hash into a problem the dwave computer could solve.
regardless, even if a computer could mine 100 million times faster than a normal miner it does not affect bitcoin negatively.  It would mostly impact the current miners profitability and that's about it.
What would happen is they would mine most of the bitcoins until the next difficulty adjustment (which would adjust faster than usual).  Difficulty would skyrocket making it nearly impossible for other miners to mine any bitcoins until they had access to similarly powered hardware.
 
After the difficulty adjustment bitcoin would continue on just fine... releasing 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes as scheduled.

Sure, but transaction fees are still very small.  If they are using it as a settlement layer that likely means they will not be performing every single transaction on the blockchain.  They will settle large groups of them (maybe once a day? hour? I don't know..) at a time.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:06:18
Sure.  The companies using the blockchain could help support the network by mining it themselves, if it came to that.  
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:16:08
Because the "good news" is simply around people using the blockchain to issue assets and record settlements using colored coins.  This will not drive demand for bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:10:04
That remains to be seen, but I'm still hopeful for it's use as a store of value.
I was just explaining the argument that IF it was ONLY used as a settlement layer then the demand and price should drop significantly.
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:29:49
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:58:21
If bitcoin becomes used primarily as a settlement layer where everything is built on top using technologies like colored coins (open assets) then they will only require a few satoshis to work.
If everyone can get by with only needing a few thousand satoshis here and there then the demand for bitcoin will never show up.
Price is determined by supply and demand.  If bitcoin is never used as a store of value or a transactional currency then the demand and hence the price will remain low.
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:05:00
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:04:23
I kind of agree but you talk like someone would have to make a decision to "hand them empires" when really it couldn't be stopped if the demand for bitcoin was great enough to warrant those prices.
Also, if it happened slowly enough (over the course of several decades) the early adopters might slowly distribute their wealth as they cash out / spend the coins.
Lastly, even if a couple people have 6 figure coin balances (I don't think there's really that many of them) their wealth would still be within the same magnitude of the current wealthiest people alive today.

Will there be some distribution based on the amount you purchased during the crowdsale? Doesn't seem fair someone buying 1 satoshi worth should get same privileges as someone who bought 1btc?

Eventually they will allow consumers to buy and sell bitcoin directly and compete with coinbase/circe (if they don't purchase them first). This way they can take a fee for the transaction.
They could also build other financial services around bitcoin and try to profit from that.
They could also build enterprise services similar to bitpay and charge businesses for those.

The best way to invest is:
1. take out a second mortgage
2. sell one kidney (and your soul)
3. market buy as many bitcoins as you can with that cash 
4. transfer all of those bitcoins to btc.sx 
5. go 10:1 margin long
6. profit!
No ??? needed, sure fire way to success.  My bitcoin investing book comes out on October.  I'll be here doing a signing shortly after.

This is the problem bitcoin/blockchain solve at a high level, he seems to be asking what does a miner do when he is "mining".  
A miner is simply shoving a random number into a hash function (sha256) until the output matches the current target hash.  It is basically random and not really a mathematical problem at all.

well, lets face it. Anyone who bought in at even $5 (suggesting that the entire bitcoin ecosystem represents a value of almost 50 million USD) was naive and deserve to lose their money.
Bitcoin is a really bad investment (as long as the economy it covers isnt growing rapidly), but i guess people started thinking the opposite because back when the bubble was inflating everyone was talking about how "bitcoin is in a deflationary spiral yadda yadda" I guess the idea that at some point in time generation will stop got people thinking that prices literally could not go down."

It's not calculating anything.  Mining is just guessing the input to sha256 that is less than some goal output.  They just keep randomly guessing until they find one.

I see it as a great way to get bitcoin in front of the masses.  People will always be able to move their coin out of these 3rd party monoliths if they would like. 
They would not have that option if they never knew about it.  Paypal is a name people know (and maybe hate but at least they know it) and they have lots of money to spend on marketing efforts.

@_date: 2015-09-22 21:34:55
Four main reasons that could be summed up into one point.  It's not always easy to buy $360 worth of bitcoin.  If
1) Not all countries can buy bitcoins easily
2) Not all people want to give their identity to coinbase/circle/etc to buy bitcoins.
3) Not all people have access to a bank account that let's them buy $360 worth of bitcoins from the previously mentioned companies.
4) You are a robot or another computer who can't buy $360 worth of bitcoins on your own.
The whole point of mining satoshis is because you can get them without having to buy bitcoin.  Once you have a few satoshis you can perform transactions on the blockchain.  Whether it be for small micro transactions or for transferring assets via colored coins, all you need is some dust.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:06:09
I think there is one pro everyone is ignoring.  It could allow someone to participate in the bitcoin network (writing data / managing assets via colored coins) without having to hand over your identity to a company like coinbase/circle to get a few bits.
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:36:26
You might follow up and ask why doesn't 21inc just load it with $360 worth of bitcoin.  Maybe they could do this? I assume it has to do with regulatory issues that would either make it impossible or extremely difficult to do this.  Essentially you'd be back to square one where you are basically just buying the bitcoin from 21inc if they went this route.
