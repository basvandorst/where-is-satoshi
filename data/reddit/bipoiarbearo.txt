Can you talk about what Blockstream is and elaborate on what you meant? I've never heard of it.

And even if he's right, the alternative with dollars is the guy goes to jail and has no money on the outside. 
At least with btc, he either has monies waiting for him when he is released from being held hostage or he can "pass on" the monies to someone on the outside.

Bahahaha! As if someone in the government is worried whether bitcoin can police itself or not lol 
Not to mention, if BTC can't survive without this subreddit or this "community" then its worthless.

I fully support this 100%.  I know there are some people in the foundation that have contributed a lot to the code, etc, but that is irrelevant of the uselessness and danger of such an institution.

Regardless of any of its usefulness, if any, the US fed gov is the most prolifically fraudulent and corrupt institution. This article is a clear example of the governments constant harassment of innocent people. 
And here you are talking about how bitcoin is legitimate and how you don't want to talk about defrauding the government. 
The best thing about bitcoin is being able to avoid much of the government interaction associated with fiat. This has benefits for everyone, including criminals. The government drove people to this because of its ineptitude. 
Avoiding criminal, primitive, broken, corrupt, and often terrorist institutions like the federal government is an honorable pursuit which by its very definition can't imply criminality as the main goal is to restore our freedoms to begin with. What you do with said freedom is your freedom to decide.

Furthermore, even if they "try to force" you, you could simply refuse and not tell them the key or its hard whereabouts (if any).  The feds would most probably send this person to jail for refusing, but the law recognizes that not everyone may be coerced by jail time and so this time could be limited. If the bitcoin are necessary to prove the crime charged with, then the charges simply can't stick because you won't divulge the bitcoin location and they can't actually physically force you to tell the truth, so they would just have to let it go, as I see it. 
Finally, even if I am wrong about them eventually just having to drop the issue, at least you still have the money and can either "pass it on" to someone you know or use it once you get out.

Maybe buy USD. There are better options but that'll do the trick.
