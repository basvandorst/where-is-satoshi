This is only true after the difficulty is adjusted down unless the miner is not acting economically rational.

Just get Neo to hook you into the matrix then you can interact with bitcoin and in the inter web physically.

F2Pool is not a mining farm/factory.  It's a pool, shutting it down (without just shifting hash to another pool) is a lot easier said than done.
Even if you did, this is only ~23% of hash so it's not going to take too much longer to find blocks.
2016 blocks is a fortnight.  The purpose of the difficulty adjustment is set the average expected block time to 10 minutes.  Note that that actual block times are random.  Sampling and resetting the difficulty more often would create more volatility/wider distribution in both the difficulty and the actual block discovery time.
Using time as a measure instead of block height is not ideal as the blockchain does not truly know or validate time accurately.

I disagree.   
Bitcoins niche and true value is the inflection point of a Permissionless, Provable, Programmable, Replicated, Shared Publishing platform.  The non-speculative value that is now attributed to the native Bitcoin token is a result of the access this token provides to publish to the network.
Thinking of Bitcoin purely in terms of a money transmitter is a disservice to a truly novel creation.

Do you also want to investigate exchanges/timeframes where no meaningful price movement occurs in "seemingly coordinated actions". Have you looked at much more mature commodity/equity markets to see if there are "seemingly" coordinated movements?

For all but store of value you also have to figure out the velocity which will likely be quite high, reducing your value calculation significantly.  In the end this would be a series of guesses, why not just guess your intrinsic value too?

@_date: 2015-05-05 22:39:09
I think the closest thing to an intrinsic valuation for bitcoin would be the marginal cost of producing new bitcoins... this is a somewhat circular argument though as the market value and cost of production has a strong (though somewhat lagged) correlation for the most part.
Reality is closer to what you don't want to hear.  Different people will see different intrinsic values based on what matters to them.

@_date: 2015-05-05 22:50:19
I can't argue with your reasoning.  :)
I think perhaps it's the definition of intrinsic that I would quibble with.  Though you've absolutely used the word appropriately, I think from an investment perspective it's meant to measure the difference between the market value and the *true* value as determined by the beholder..  and therein lies the problem; objective investment intrinsic value does not exist.
Just to play devils advocate, using your intrinsic value logic all stocks, bonds, etfs etc would have no intrinsic value as they are all mostly worthless if no one else wants them.

if your concern is about privacy/anonymity, this will not really help at all.
if your concern is more security/opsec related then reusing from a receiving standpoint is not an issue, it's reusing from a spend perspective that is potentially dangerous.  The reason being that once you have signed a transaction for any unspent output that was sent to that address then you have published your public key to the blockchain, prior to transaction only the Base58 encoded RIPEMD hash of it was publicly known (aka the address).

Have a look at the blockchain API call pubkeyaddr.  This will only work for addresses that have spent transactions on the blockchain though.  
Otherwise it is likely impossible (but not provably so) to compute the public key of an address, as the address is computed from the hash of the public key which by very definition is a one way function.

Banks pay the premiums on FDIC insurance. Though it's a government agency it is fully funded by its premiums.  The 2008/09 crisis had virtually nothing to do with FDIC insurable securities as it only applies to checking, savings, money market and CDs. Stocks, bonds, mortgages, derivatives and other fancy things are simply not directly related to FDIC coverage.
Bottom line is speculating with money on crypto will be far more risky in many ways over a bank deposit for quite some time. If you believe otherwise you are ill informed and/or delusional.

You can submit transactions without a fee, they will take a bloody long time to confirm though or possibly never.

Plenty of ways to trade both Long and short with Bitcoin on leverage and with futures. Bitmex is my favourite, or is 100x leverage not enough for you?

How would this be better than existing cash or cheque? How would the currency to bitcoin peg be maintained? Why would anyone in their right mind take on this risk and volatility when there are way better and established means of exchange?

Nothing. Nada. None.

You mean the scenario where difficulty is adjusted down and/or mining efficiency increases? Much like how the system was envisioned to function?

Your facts and logic are surely infallible... wait, you have neither, never mind.

Sorry, but this is a bad idea.
@_date: 2016-10-16 23:54:37
Sure, go ahead, you are free to set your own fee and compete for space in the upcoming blocks.  Under your scheme though you won't have a consistent confirmation time and nor should you.

No. Plus, your version of reform sounds like tax evasion to me.

So funny how people make mindless fantastical projections based on a myopic and misguided perception of reality.

Currencies do need "marketing".  Good money should drive out the bad if that's truly the case.

How do you know in advance how many BTC will be transacted in a given block?
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:06:15
If you exclude fiat from consideration then you do not have s volatility problem as 1 bitcoin is equal to 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-19 01:09:33
The vast majority of people do not understand how traditional currencies actually work but they use them extensively.  I do however agree that the software ecosystem for Bitcoin is still comparatively immature but is rapidly developing.
The timeliness of fiat transactions is illusory, in reality most of these transactions take at least a couple days, that you can "see" them before hand is not much different than seeing them as unconfirmed in the mempool.
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:42:18
I don't think you know of what you speak.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:38:52
What would be the point. Plus no gov/central bank in their right mind would give up control over monetary policy. Inflation is not inherently bad...

Why do you use so many words?  Your language bemuddles your intent.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:15:42
Glad you took my constructive criticism for what it was and that you will work bemuddled into your vernacular.
My origins are neither poker or Bitcoin based.  I consider language, code, music and expression in general to be one of this highest forms of art.  To be able to eloquently and efficiently convey ones thoughts and feelings is no easy task.
I have read several of your posts and there is usually, in my opinion, a nugget of worthiness buried within a cacophony of unwarranted  analogies, metaphors and adjectives.  To each their own though I guess.  Cheers.

BTC is much closer to a bearer instrument than fiduciary money imho.
A bearer instrument is a document that entitles the holder of the document rights of ownership or title to the underlying property, such as shares or bonds. Bearer instruments differ from normal registered instruments, in that no record is kept of who owns the underlying property, or of the transactions involving transfer of ownership. Whoever physically holds the bearer document is assumed to be the owner of the property.

For two years of "interest" you don't seem to know much.

Yes lots of people do, in fact anyone who can use Google can learn this magical skill.

BTC would be one of the worst choices to hedge against USD and associated forex volatility.  You will only be introducing more volatility.  Better choice would be a basket of commodities.
Diversification and speculation yes, hedging no.
@_date: 2016-10-25 23:30:49
Not even close.  The "spam" transactions last summer hit ~90,000.

@_date: 2015-10-30 01:13:44
Yes, hedging is not "betting" on greater fools to come along.  This speculation at best, gambling at worst.
I'm bullish on Bitcoin and it's possibilities, but it's pure fantasy to talk about anyone opting out of the fiat world at this point or even the foreseeable future.

So where is the inside info?
@_date: 2016-05-17 23:21:42
With a Block each 10 minutes on average there are 144 blocks in a day and 2016 in a fortnight.
The blocks are found randomly with a poisson distribution. This means in an period there may be more or less blocks found than expected. The standard deviation varies as the square root of the number of blocks.
Over a day the deviation would be around sqrt(144) or 12 blocks. This is about 8% so if a new difference was found each day the difference would be more than 8% in error 30% of the time. It would really fluctuate. This is why daily adjustments would be a problem.
With 14 days the deviation is around the sqrt(2016) blocks or 44 blocks or 2%. So the fortnightly deviation is only in error by about 2%.
Even if the actually network hashing rate never changed we would frequently see difficulty changes as wide as 2% each fortnight and larger swings every now and again. Difficulty changes are only accurate to about 2%.

I don't think you understand stock splits or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-15 23:26:26
I think you are talking about an algorithm to reverse the SHA-256 hashing function.  While likely quite exceedingly difficult to do (especially with today's hardware) it's also not provably impossible.
@_date: 2016-05-18 03:04:29
True, I missed the part about the rolling period and daily adjustments.  This would create a smoother distribution over events like the halving even keeping the 2016 block sample size.  Not sure all the implications though and there was no such issue during the last halving so why would this happen this time?

what's wrong with BIP38?   If you really want kludge biometric stuff then homebrew it into your BIP38 passphrase... but deriving an actually private key out of these is not likely advisable from an entropy perspective.

Given the choice I bet 99.9% choose the candy.  It's not like they can easily buy candy or anything for that matter with only 1$ worth of BTC.

Stuff like this is fodder for ridicule and is a disservice to the real progress of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
