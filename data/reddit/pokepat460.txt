That was his point. That being unvaccinated is not detetcable at first glance, just like being gay or having HIV, and that it would be difficult or impossible to actually refuse to service unvaccinated people because, just like those who are gay or have HIV, you can't tell without knowing the person. 
He isn't saying being gay or hiv positive is like being unvaccinated in any other way that the detectability issue. Perhaps a better anaolgy would have been trying to not serve people with currently living grandparents. How would you know that without knowing the person? You couldn't, just like an unvaccinated person.

Its a little of both. If you are going to be driving home soon it directly impacts your safety. But yeah, its mostly outrage, but I think it is justified outrage if the person really is completely drunk and not just a beer or two in.

Shipping for batteries on Fasttech takes like 2 months or more. I love fasttech, but for batteries, there are better sites considering the dramatic shipping times.
