Bitcoin was first touted as a currency with the store of value being a secondary property dependent upon it's use as a currency. As it began to fail as a currency people started to promote it as a store of value whilst ignoring that is dependent upon it being a good currency (high volume to reduce volatility). 
If another coin replaces it as a currency and secures the bulk of the mining network, then bitcoin's value as a store of value disappears.   
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:01:43
The Bitcoin network is theoretically more secure only because there are more miners securing the network. It has nothing to do with how old it is or how much drama there has been in the community. If the bulk of the mining power switched to another coin then that would have more network security.

It's not just a personal problem. Have a look over at r/coinbase. People need to be aware of the risks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:29:38
And no doubt these noobs would look no further than the totally unbiased echo chamber that is r/bitcoin for information about how to invest their money in a high risk speculative market. Personally I'm just here to shit posts and lols. I'll probably get bored of it and leave again before my account has sufficiently aged to be considered worthy of participation in this upstanding community of kiddie-fiddler-coin shills.

@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:51
Don't mean to be pedantic, but price and adoption aren't the same thing. The price was high because everyone was buying it, but adoption was low because nobody was using it.
Issues that hinder adoption need to be fixed before it has any chance of recovery back to the ludicrous prices of December. 
The congestion of the blockchain and the insane tx fees are the first things that need to be addressed. Personally I'm not confident the proposed solutions will be effective. 
If these issues are remedied then people need to start using it as a currency rather than a speculative instrument to get rich quick. If it  proves useful as a currency then it should grow in a relatively healthy and sustainable fashion, rather than going hyperbolic in a speculative frenzies followed by blood baths.
But yeah, this could be the beginning of the end.

Yeah, but cryptos are more recent and criminals have been adopting them from the early days. If they held some of their proceeds in cypto during the bull runs they would have profited very nicely. It is not inconceivable that many criminals have large holdings in crypto. 
The OP cares, that's why he asked. If you don't care then why did you reply?

If fiat is a better currency for criminals then why would they start using bitcoin?

I no longer wish to continue giving you a platform by engaging any further.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:57:05
It is relevant for psychological reasons, so still very relevant. After all, it is largely these reasons why bitcoin has been so successful. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:53:48
IANAL but I doubt that a warrant could be obtained on blockchain alone. If it was only a handful of small orders you probably have nothing to worry about (especially if you aren't in possession of illegal goods). If you are a big player its possible that any identifying information could be used to start building a case.

A meme that is strongly associated with the alt right. By posting it I can only assume that the OP supports the alt right, or he is a useful idiot who naively spreads alt right memes.

You should be able to speed up the transaction with 'replace by fee' or 'child pays for parent'. Look into these if you need the tx to confirm sooner and to to see which option if any would work best in your situation.

It is a falsifiable statement. Governments and/or banks can try their best and either prove the statement to be right or wrong. My only intent in making was to call bs on the parent comment. It's cool though, I cbf trying to prove a point.

Sure, I believe them. They say they have the money in an undisclosed bank, why would they lie? Besides, nobody in crypto is corrupt. Crypto was designed to rescue us from the corruption of fiat enslavement. Only a statist shill would try to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Tether.

You don't believe governments could ban bitcoin within their jurisdiction or that banks could refuse to do business with exchanges ? Whilst these scenarios wouldn't* kill cryptos, either would severely limit their ability to be useful outside of a small fringe group (even smaller and fringier than currently).

@_date: 2018-01-22 12:50:51
All else being equal the number of coins in supply shouldn't make a difference regarding a change in market cap of x%. It just means that more lower value coins need to be purchased. 
The volume of trades (say, measured in fiat) does matter though. It is easier to move a market with low volume than it is a higher volume market.

All of the coins fluctuate at different rates at different times. It's a crap shoot for the most part. However bitcoin is the main coin as it is the easiest to buy with fiat and then you can buy/sell other coins with bitcoin. Generally if bitcoin is going up then many of the alt coins will to. Conversely if bitcoin goes down the alts will usually lose more value. Of course there are always exceptions to this rule of thumb. Hence people can make more money gambling with alt coins. And they can also lose more.

Neither of those events had anything to do with corruption. Those was merely expressions of the natural forces of trustless decentralised free market. The funds of people who weren't capable of securing their wealth were transferred to others who were adept to operating in a liberated economy and are therefore more deserving. The same will likely happen with Tether. No corruption at all.
