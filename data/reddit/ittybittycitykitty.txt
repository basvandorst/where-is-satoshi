I like this: "the world's most strongly protected ledger." Very much the point of the time-stamp proof-of-publication type transaction. 
But if OP_RETURN gets to be seen as a burden by miners, they will simply drop those tx. Seen already (though maybe just by accident as many haven't got up to 0.9) in the recent double spend exploits. 
Nodes likewise, though they get less of a vote, but if full nodes just do not propagate OP_RETURN tx in protest at 'bloat', it hardly matters if it is 'in the protocol spec' or not.
So, OP_RETURN fans (and I am one), be civil. Don't abuse it, or it will go away.

I keep thinking how -valuable- good meta-data is. Just try to buy some new thingamabob from the thingy store, or even mention it on a FB post. Within seconds, adverts everywhere you go are targeting your thingamabob needs. It seems pretty clear gmail, yahoo and all read at least your email headers (with subject line) and sell the results. 
Just how valuable is a metric like 'new authenticated users' from coinbase? How hard would it be to get it from a smart Gmail ~~spy~~ adwords program? For all you know, coinbase (peace be on their house) keeps this metric, and it is leaking.

I've built a coin spectrum analyser, that gives the percent contribution from each coinbase mined coin any particular coin (transaction) has. 
Almost useless if there is mixing in a coin's history, but interesting too. I have found some coins with 'metal' (percent contribution) back as far as block 74000, just in random testing.
If y'all want to try it before the interface is up, PM part of your IP to me, I will open the RPC for you.

The Mad box gets filled by both partys. Each have 1BTC at stake.
Then, each party exchanges their stuff. I send you money, you send me the painting.
You are right on problem number 1. In order to be trusted with something of a given worth, I have to be exposed for as much or more of its worth. Basic. But hidden behind a police force and big daddy shopping centers in conventional world.
Now, if you send me a painting that I don't like, but you totally value at 1BTC, what happens? Well, you have the money (worth, we presume 1BTC), but you are out the ransom (1BTC), because I don't want to unlock the ransom box.
So because you sold me a painting I dont like, you are at zero sum.
I am out the money, and the ransom (2BTC total value), but have a painting.
So, because I bought a painting I didn't like, I am out 2BTC and have to look at the darn thing.
I would have every incentive to work it out somehow.
Now, if your painting was actually worth 2BTC and you sold it to me for $500, why, things would be different.

How about a node Union? You join the node union, and agree to run your node in a certain way. The union, once powerful enough, can extort fees from miners and merchants, (call it selling advertising if you want) and pay nodes to run.
For instance, unionized nodes will delay relaying empty blocks, and expensive transactions. Alternatively, expedite relaying certain other transactions.
A member of a node union can collude with other members. For instance by tracking entry points, and obscuring entry points. Even selling entry point data to the highest bidder, or promising not to (for a fee, of course).
Just some thread hijaacking thoughts.

The format *must* be open, or the service becomes too dependent on proofofexistence.com. I want my proof of publication to last and be verifiable for 50 years or more. 
Proofofexistence.com does a nice service packaging all the sha digest and op_return publishing though, and being able to send a client to their site to look up proof is a big plus.
I like data that can speak for itself, just my 2c, but finding

I have bitcoind, slightly modified to create transactions with op_return data in them.
I want my friend to send me a little bitcoin, using a transaction that 1.) refers to a specific output of a specific transaction (that was me, sending them a little bitcoin), and 2.) has op_return data in it.
Rather than ask them to get a client that can put in the op_return data and be sure of the setup, I would construct the rawtransaction for them, and send that to the friend.
Then my friend signs the transaction and sends it. They can sign it, 'cause it refers to a tx that sends them coin.
And of course, they are savy enough to examine the raw tx to be sure I am not sending them a hertz-doughnut or something.

Maybe I would divide the problem into chunks in nonce-space, and allocate a chunk to each of my pool participants. The faster they are, the bigger a chunk they get.

Have good actor provide proof of their identity. A photo of them holding their ID or something. 
Now have them sign that proof of identity document with their bitcoin address. If the proof document is a jpeg file, digest that with sha or whatever and have the good actor sign the digest.
Now, payments from that address are arguably under the control of your good actor. 
Sure, they could have the bad actor sign their id photos, but that sort of begs the question as to what you mean by good or bad.

In regard to it being more financially responsible to take the loss, that would be a decision operating in a vacuume. Knowing the scammer has something to lose gives you a reason to believe it is worth trying to settle the issue.
Of course the scammer, knowing you have a lot more to lose, has reason to believe you will just curse them and unlock the ransom, as you say.
It comes back to reputation, then, which I was trying to avoid. The scammer needs to escape their bad reputation to profit. (Not that -I- am trying to escape a bad reputation or something..)

A person running a full node that expects a visit from the tooth fairy needs to implement some way of presenting a bitcoin address. 
I am sure it could be a lot more light-wieght than a full web server, but I am not clever enought to build that, so for the example I would have a web server running on the same IP as the node, and that web server would return the bitcoin address. Was the command wget? 
curl ' ip}/pillow.txt' ?
It could also be put into an RPC option (the rest of the RPC, of course, severely limited), offhand:  ip}:8332?'{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "method": "getTooth", "params": [] }'
Full nodes can offer other services to the tooth fairy, too. For instance, looking up transactions, or computing taint. That could be done over RPC also.

It shows when the document was signed and submitted. 
Sorta like, I can go down to Bloomberg's and get a boilerplate contract. That document is really quite old. I can even mostly fill it all out. All that can be weeks, years ahead of time.
But when it comes time to sign it, then the block hash time stamp comes to help fix it it time.
Way in the future, the weasel lawyer pulls out a fake contract and tries to shake me down, but ha ha, I say, show me your rmd160.
The scum! Weasel has made a fake contract, and registered it with their own rmd160 a week before I signed. "Arrr matey, there ye be, all hashed and proper. Pieces of eight it is from you, now".
"Tis a fake and you know it, Weasel Dan." I say. "See and I can show, my rmd160 has been signed by my own coin.".
"Aye, that may be. But can ye show 'twas not your coin that signed this, as well?".
"Ah ha! Be you knowin that all my contracts must have my signature on the rmd160 of the prior? Show me this, you cannot. Be off with you".

I am saying the miners are getting paid $31 per transaction. How you account for it is not the issue. They get $31 per transaction. They are not dumb, they've got really expensive equipment they have to pay for. They probably will not do it for less.
Actually, your descriptions of value loss or inflaton or tax are all interesting, there ought to be an accounting method that would get that $31/tr to ballance. But as I said, that is a side issue.
That is how much it costs (plus a bit of profit) to process transactions right now, is what the guys are getting paid.

Commissions seem a good direction. 
Because you have to establish a dialogue with your buyer, it is not as risky as an outright sale. You chat, discuss the project, take a small deposit for materials, start work, show progress, ask for, say, half the total. And so on.
Competition for custom stained glass work is not negligible. Just google it, to see what options your buyer will have, and figure out why they should buy from your dad and not some other guy. Taking bitcoin might be that reason. Being way up in AK might be another.
I just browsed your reddit. GOLD! Put some raw gold dust into those stained glass works somehow. Maybe melt it onto the glass or something.

Bitcoin stats page: [stats](
last 24 hours, there were apx 70000 transactions, and 3500 BTC 'rewarded'. That comes to $31 per transaction 'rewarded' to the miners for processing those 70000 transactions into blocks.
Who paid that 3500 BTC? Actually, who paid it is beside the point, the point is, it was paid (call it rewarded if you want. Same thing), and the miners valued it to the tune of 3500BTC * current market price.
That is the real price for running the system. That should be obvious, I don't want to belabor it.
What is not clear is what the final price should be. The answer lies in an abstraction of the entire blockchain concept, in the cost of the difficulty of hashing a block of transactions. If the cost is too low, the difficulty too low, the blockchain falls apart, is too fragile to attack. 
This is why I do not see a future where cheap plug in mining dongles are possible.

You are right. I should say price. That is the price being paid to miners at the moment. As you say, their revenue. The price they are getting is an estimate of what the cost is, to them, of doing what they do, and hence the cost that must be anticipated, by the bitcoin network, of continuing.
The invented metric is (total-given-to-miners-in-24-hrs)/(total-transactions-in-24hrs).
You may be right, that cost per transaction is the wrong metric. Yes, cost. It might be better to worry about cost per transaction*dollars. At least that is dimensionless.

Thats where I get a bit fuzzy. Doesn't it take more effort to hash 500 transactions into a block than 80?
As for the 'what is' vs 'what is necessary', well, here is a little story.
I took a cab from the airport. The guy said 'The fare is $0.50, plus a $31 tip (his reward)'. Ok, so we agree it cost $31.50 to take the cab (though my passengers insist it is only $.50). Next time I have to get from the airport, should I have $32 on hand?  I am kinda naive, I expect it actually does cost some $30 per trip to run a cab from the airport.
Maybe the figure is way off. After all, back a year ago, it was about $10 per transaction, and the miners didn't seem to be starving.

Connectivity would fragment as it came back in spots.
Blockchain forks would be a problem, there would be as many as there were islands in the fragmented network.
Though disconnected, miners, if they had power, would continue to build on their chains, even with zero transactions.
When connectivity is restored, there will be a battle over whether the longest chain, worth a few hundred thousand dollars, would be allowed, or the whole thing rolled back to the last transaction.

Your second case is more likely, especially as I image quite a few folk would be inclined to think of the ransom as the payment. So I think the usual 'product shipped when payment (not ransom, that is already set up) confirmed' would still be typical. 
If the MAD escrow were truely effective, it wouldn't matter who went first. I could ship before getting payment, confident you would pay.

How about mining zero tx blocks into the attacked chain?
But in a hostile environment, the attacked chain miners can reject submissions from the attacker. 
Note to space kid:
Look up 'Distributed systems evolvolution and osmotic independence'. 
re space kid. That would be my inner geek-child. I see the roles of miners, nodes, merchants and users in this distributed system as an evolving thing, similar to life evolving in the ocean. A critical point in life evolution is when cell walls form; barriers between the primordial soup and the new living entity. Nodes, or miners, likely will self organise, and put up barriers between themselves, asserting themselves as independent from other, similar entities. Kinda spacy.

nope. Cost per Thash. Not Thash. It is the cost that counts. Say I could get a 50pHash/sec machine for, oh, $50. That could be a serious problem to the blockchain security. But of course if -everyone- could get 1PHash/sec per dollar, the blockchain hashrate would go to, oh, I dont know, doesn't matter. But it would be no more secure than now. 
But indeed I am wrong to say it is the cost per hash/sec. It is the distribution of hashing power that secures the blockchain. If there were only one miner, running at 50PH/s, that would not be secure at all.

Sure. Don't know of  tool offhand, but you could just step back and back on blockchain.info. Of course, it will quickly turn into a sort of family tree, as each of the bitcoin transactions that got you your 'coin has multiple inputs, and each of those can have multiple inputs, all the way back to probably quite a few different genesis blocks.
Kinda like colored coins. As if your particular 'coins' had a bit of color from each genesis block in its ancestory. It would be kinda fun to see. Once.
Edit: OK, I tried that by hand. You soon find transactions with 20 or 50 inputs, and quite a few like that. Say there were 10 of those of size 20. Be prepared to handle 20^10 queries into the block chain to get through that mess back to the genesis transactions.

Just traces back transaction history till it hits a coinbase.
Sorta like each block creates a colored coin, and each transaction mixes the colors of it's inputs in proportion to their amounts.
I haven't found a 'pure' coin yet, that I can trace all tx before going into dust. 
Hadn't really thought of days destroyed information as emerging from the spectrum, not sure exactly what that is or what it implies. I was just curious about any particular coin's history, similar to holding a badly worn mercury dime and wondering who all had held on to it, spent it, and why.

Thanks. The raw transaction isn't just proof, it is verificatioin (sp courtesy of Milwaukee's Best), as it is actor C (the OP in this case) who inspects it and finally sends it to the network.
If, for instance, gasmycar were to send me a signed raw transaction for, say, 0.1 BTC, I would look at the taint of the transaction it referred to, and judge it with my [numismatic]( appraisal in regards to its closeness to coinbase transactions. Of course, I would probably accept it, and send it to the network regardless.
The question of provenance is on my mind. I think the signed id photo manages that, as Scurvy Dan can only create imitations that are post-dated.
The question of proof of sale is more diffiicult. What is to stop our turncoat, some time in the future, from claiming that Scurvy Dan has stolen their ID (from the Mt Gox leak or wherever) and was the one who bought the contraband, honest.
Your video chat solution settles that, but may be a problem admitting to court.
 
But the value of untainted 'coin is, I think, not yet appreciated.

Pretty hasty chart from excel. It would look nicer with lines and not little x marks. Maybe next chart. 
This is a spectrum of the 'coin Oliver  Janssens is offering for his 'replace bitcoin foundation with AI or something' challenge. I only show about 15% of the spectrum, the rest is way back somewhere.
Y axis is log(10) of fraction contributed from the particular block height to the total in the 'coin. So a point at -2 would represent 1% of the value of the 'coin. Points at -8 represent 0.000001%.
X axis (marked along the top, thanks excel) is the blockheight. So, for instance, somewhere a bit before block 230000, 50BTC (was the reward 50 back then?) was mined. That 50BTC was split, and split, lots of times. A very tiny portion of that reward made its way into the 'coin Oliver Jaansens is offering, and that portion makes up 0.001% of the reward 'coin.

For this to happen, laws would have to be passed or legal precedent established relating to bitcoin taint.  So, 'coin tainted with, say 1% bad would be ok, but more than 1% bad would be illegal? Imagine trying to pass a law like that! What would the limits be? Who would measure them? How is the black-list maintained? Who pays for maintaining it? - All just too messy and imprecise.

Probbly one of the first rules of an AML policy is to not reveal the details of the policy. For instance, if the bad guys *knew* cash deposits less than $5000 or ($10000 or whatever) will not trigger AML, they would keep their cash deposits below that.
Way back, the subject came up when opening an account. I asked the banker what the threshold was for AML, and he said he could not tell me that.
Probably the best bitStamp and others can and should do is have a clear policy on what they do when AML KYC is triggered. If I just tried to sell 50BTC at $550, and their policy says 'Whoa!', do I still get the $27500, eventually? Or do I only get $17600 cause the price tanked by the time they were satisfied? That, at least, should be clearly stated if it isn't already.

I toyed with the idea of a sort of 'precious token' added to the escrow, that could be awarded to a third party arbitrator should the need arise.

I read your last point with alarm. 'Wow, that would realy happen!' I think. 
There really are consumers that will not believe the vendor actually has money in the MAD, and there really are vendors who will bank on that, and sell shoddy stuff. 
So for me to open my MAD shop, I need a clientele educated to the ways of MAD. The presence of the NashX store helps that. This reddit helps that. Actually having transaction signing set up in the user interface of bitcoind-qt is almost critical to that.
The problem of the unscrupulous vendor or the unruly customer are part of doing business, though. I myself leveraged 4 extra $35 parts from a vendor selling used ones as new on ebay, knowing conflict resolution would result in an expensive deal breaker. 
It would have been the same with MAD, I think. Both of us had 'skin in the game', in the form of a flawless reputation, and neither wanted to risk loosing it. To be honest, if instead I had $500 at stake, and only the two of us to decide what was fair, I do not know how it would have turned out. I think I would have been a bit more cautious in complaining; I came out ahead in the ebay version, probably would have come out even, more fair, in a MAD version.
I think, in my MAD store, MAD would be an option, an alternative to 'trust us, we have a flawless reputation going back a whole 2 months'. The MAD funds would not have to cover total inventory, of course, only sales in progress. For my puny store, that would be just the most expensive item.

In short term, increasing hash rate does not increase either number of transactions (and hence total mining income from fees) or total number of blocks mined, so does not increase total income to miners. That is the fixed size. 
Even long term, increasing hash rate does not result in more transaction volume, though they may be correlated and even related psycologicallly (sp) by the false (ok, hit me) perception that higher hash rate means higher security.
The only incentive, and it is a powerful one, for increasing hash rate is to get more of the pie.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:51:54
Seems to me, once the thing stabilizes, transacton fees will meet the cost to process transactions. I think some forward thinking mining concerns are getting a pretty good handle on what it costs to process transactions, but hold their figures pretty close to the chest. A good estimate is a valuable thing.
I was hoping the article would have some further analysis of the transaction costs, but it did not, just simply stated baldly 'gonna be too high'.

That's pretty clever. I don't quite get the second scenario though. You broadcast the 'lock til 290000' transaction. It propagates, but stays unconfirmed til 290000.

You can insist on only accepting 0conf tx that the majority of the mining pools will take. So you have to evaluate the tx, and if it looks dodgy (likely to not get mined right away) the customer has to wait, or show id or something.

Yes, interesting.
I used to be worried about that, envisioning a sort of 'peak hash' effect that would lead to a self fullfilling downward spiral. But now I think it will just sort of ooze down to level.
It *should* stabilize, as the rate of return (for pools with a significant fraction of the total hash) per killowat is not linear, it bows down. Twice as much effort and twice as much hash rate does not give twice as much return.
When the difficulty flat-lines stable, cost to mine will equal reward from mining. Probably less than optimum hashing engines will be switched out and back in as the market dictates, and even over-clocking could be backed away from.
There *should* be an evolving market for demand priced power, running at a speed of a few seconds, the time it takes the wind generators to spin up from a gust. Hash pools, being quite agile in their power use, can easily compete in a one second power market.

Valuation? For me, the only value of bitcoin (which could be huge) is its ability to mediate transactions. Hence the focus on what the cost per transaction will turn out to be. The huge build-out of fantastic hash rate machines seems a good area to consider in more detail.

How can mining be made more evenly competitive?
I see that pool of low priority transactions, the ones that miners take their own sweet time in getting around to, as an opportunity for a bottom feeding miner. If there were some way to grab a block of transactions that all the big miners just leave lying around, solve it, and get it back into the 'chain, that would push every miner to fairly evaluate the transactions they process. And also give a bit of use to otherwise useless hashing power.
Otherwise, mining guilds will begin to pick and choose what transactions they will not process.

CEO's answer, as he said, still does not protect you from the turncoat actor.
It really doesn't matter if it is A (once trusted) or B (tainted) who sends you the coin if it is under the direction of A, so I simplify this to just A (the possible turncoat) and C (you).
CEO's solution is good for proving to yourself it is your turncoat who is sending, but not what they actually send.
Better would be for the tempted-turncoat to first move the funds into an address they own, and tell you that address. You can then inspect that address for any taint with the best tools you have, at the least with blockchain.info. 
Then have them create the transaction and send that to you. You can inspect the transaction, and if it meets your criteria, you send it to the network (incidentally foiling any node-ip tracking snoops). 
    A: 
    bitcoin-cli listunspent
    bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction
    bitcoin-cli signrawtransaction
    Email result to C
    C:
    bitcoin-cli decoderawtransaction
    bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction
You must, of course, be able to spot in the transaction whatever it is about a transaction from a tainted source it is you are worried about. I am guessing you do not want coins that some outside agent, law enforcement or whatever, would hold you accountable for. 
You may also want to be able to prove at some time in the future, and against A's will at that time, that the transaction indeed came from A. A proof of sale. CEO's solution for that is close. But you must record the video chat, and the thwarted-turncoat must show, say, a screen shot of the completed transaction.
Now a person viewing that recording in the future, when A has turned and denys sending the coin ("'twern't me that sent that. Scurvy Dan musta done it."), has proof that A actually did send the coin.
That is a nice solution that does not require a third party, say, a notary public, to verify the identity of A.
Thank you for an interesting question.

I may do that. There seems the danger that, as value gets attached to harvesting this kind of information, the 'just hand me your node list' bots will escalate the way the search engine bots have, both in number and in agressive tactics, until the majority of traffic is from harvesters like bitnodes.io, and not from legitimate nodes.
For instance, and maybe I have it wrong here, there is a different reason for the multiple port numbers, but maybe the multiple port numbers are a way for bitnodes to appear to my node as unique inquiries, to which my node would deliver new random selections of my node list.

That is an interesting critique. 
Miners are paid for processing transactions. Colored coin transaction fees would be the same as bitcoin fees. In fact, if they are below threshold (10mBTC), they pay a premium.
The fee is not based on value, but transaction size. Though I imagine it is human nature to adjust the fee (by whatever means) based on the amount of cash changing hands.
For instance, the mining blocks are powerfull enough now to simply start changing their fee structure. Perhaps charge more for annoying (to some) op_return transactions, or making deals like expiditing high value high fee transactions.

I've been thinking about nodes, and folk saying full nodes are not incentivized for their bandwidth and storage. 
There is nothing to stop a node from censoring traffic, refusing to transmit transactions it does not like, big fat op_return spam for instance. So nodes will start to form unions, and find some way to charge toll on transactions. Maybe mining pool kickbacks. Maybe mining and nodes will merge.
Just rambling.

I do not quite understand your question.
There are two seperate things: the MAD box, and the sale.
The sale consists of the buyer sending payment and receiving the item, and conversely the seller sending the item and receiving the payment. 
The sale exchange could be -anything-. It could be a trade of paintings, trade of services (mow my lawn, I will give you duck eggs), or typical sale, dollars for goods.
It is probably wrong to call MAD an escrow. It does not become a payment. Everyone gets their money back out of the MAD box once everyone is happy. If someone gets, ahem, mad, the ransom money stays in the box.

Classic microeconomics can describe typical supply-demand behavior.
But the hashrate economy is different. Not only is it zero-sum (a fixed size of the total prize {at least at any given instant}), but improving my cut of the pie by increasing hashrate decreases everyone elses.

Hashrate has very little to do with securing the blockchain. What secures the blockchain is the cost to aquire 51% of the total hashrate.
