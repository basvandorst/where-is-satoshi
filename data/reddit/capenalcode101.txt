If you short the future you will also want to sell btc to support your position.   This could then overwhelm the buy side.

A guy I used to work with did 30k on Localbitcoin. He was super sketched out but everything went smoothly. I think you can start small (maybe 5-10k) and feel the buyer out before going big on Localbitcoin. Just my two cents.
