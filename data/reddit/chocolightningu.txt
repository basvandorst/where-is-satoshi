Haha that's what they want you to think. That they are keeping you safe. Real money laundering is going through major banks or cash not crypto. See HSBC. Trafficking people? You think that's the small time players in crypto? Nope. It's the people in power. Government officials and the filthy rich.

Decentralization is a MUST! Need to keep the block limit small. Segwit is a block size increase. People just need to start using it. Switched to segwit and the fees are super low if you aren't in a hurry.

To the moon! That pure gold shirt is nuts.

Get more bitcoin memorabilia and open a bitcoin museum!
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:28:30
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:32:38
Damn right it's better than gold and USD!
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:27:20
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:27:00
Must be nice...
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:10:19
They are business so they do what profits them most but letting them know we demand it is good. Signed!
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:36:00
Don't try to spam the blockchain with these small amounts. I doubt anyone will tip a big enough amount to not spam the network when they withdraw. Just keep bitcoin as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:02:46
That's too bad. People probably stopped spending because the price was going up so fast everyone was HODLING.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:02:52
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:00:07
BTC is for decentralization and store of value aka digital gold. I'm surprised you're still holding btrash. SELL IT ALREADY. Don't go to the other sub they will just tell you lies.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:53:20
Next stop 20k??
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:38:28
Being debt free is great but future you might resent present you for doing that. Maybe. Who am I kidding, of course future you will!
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:37:59
How did that happen? You'd have to be pretty dense to confuse the two... Wait is your "friend" actually you?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:29:59
Yes, Adam is okay with $100 fees so that's fine by me.
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:38:13
amen to that!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:40:32
I'll be using LN so it won't matter.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:15
Everyone dump their bcash when they can!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:28:26
Yes, LN will be like our trains, buses, carpooling etc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:27:11
Lol sorry, did you actually check out their site? There nothing on there. Some no name site taking pot shots at one of the biggest bitcoin businesses in the US. Well, it got you to post about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:26:19
Exactly, everyone listen to this guy, he know what he talking about! HODL! When LN comes out we will get cheap fees. The price will be moon when you can use LN.
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:21:45
Twiddling my thumbs until moon.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:04:09
Try not to send your coins. It's meant to be HODL'd! If you must, make sure to use segwit!
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:24:34
hnnng can we start the bull run?
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:22:19
Is this the beginning of the next run up? You bet it is! I'm going to be right one of these days.
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:52:03
Shady af. Let them know you're not going away!
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:29:29
It's a store of value. You won't be transacting on chain often. Lightning network will take care of the bulk of transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:50:45
Some people are just too naive, trusting, greedy, or just plain dumb.
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:23:06
Great work!
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:40:55
I totally missed the menu. That's how it would have to work right? Since you're not hosting your own node and using them as a service? I get you, they're just another paypal or visa...
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:09:42
That's a really good point. I always just said bitcoin uses way less electricity than the financial sector.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:17:29
At least they learned their lesson. Most people don't learn until they get burned.
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:46:42
SFYL. Bitcoin is a store of value. You should hold it unless you can spend it using the lightning network. Then you can close the channel if they are being shady.
Definitely be more persistent with bitflyer since they said they got your payment.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:05:34
I think this is a borderline spam transaction. Get them to accept Lightning payments!
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:06:31
Awesome work!
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:36:33
When moon lambo?
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:39:58
Into the pockets of the rich. Certainly not mine...
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:35:33
Difference is the 1% of control the money supply while 1% of bitcoiners can't. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:37:20
HODL!!! Hope we get another ATH soon.
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:31:45
Where did you see that? I couldn't find anything remotely useful on the site.
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:55:29
Nope, then there could be contentious hard forks. Bitcoin Core is the reference client for a reason.
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:43:44
Sooner rather than later please!
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:59:36
$100k in 5 years! I wish that was today! I don't want to be 5 years older I just want the price.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:35:32
Please when market up go?
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:51:23
Still HODLing! Maybe I'll buy more when price is under comment count.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:31:34
Oh cool posts from 2012! 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:53:59
I hope they continue with it. Buying more as the price goes down.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:48:14
Approaching a good time to accumulate.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:50:09
I'll take a coke, see if there are any bitcoin articles in the newspaper, check out ATM price. I'll have to pass on the LTC. More BTC for me.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:32:31
I think you're supposed get money back by using credit cards?
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:30:39
One of us! One of us!
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:28:39
Have you looked at the balance of your public key? I know people monitor addresses of well know phrases to sweep the amounts deposited.
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:29:30
I'm maxed out hodling so I can't spend...
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:35:39
I'm pretty sure it's relatively less volatile now than in the past.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:16:33
Seems fishy... not posting for 1 year and then all of a sudden this post? If real SFYL.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:30:09
I'd be pretty happy with that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:09:33
Greeeeeeed. Greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed. Greeeeeeeeeeeedeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:07:53
Good thing is that you only have to deal with it once, if you're a holder. If you bought in at $32 years ago and held through $2 and back, you're still up by a lot.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:52:10
Wow, I don't even know where to begin. With sound money, you shouldn't have to borrow. You should be able to save and not have your savings erode every year. Credit only benefits the rich as they have the assets and low risk creditors want. Sound money gives more power to the laborer as the employer must negotiate to reduce pay instead of every laborer fighting to increase it. There's a reason why it's the norm to job hop than to ask for a raise.
Creditors still can make money by investing in sound businesses that are projected to grow faster than the sound money appreciates.
Bitcoin is capped for a reason.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:31:32
almost.... there....
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:20:12
HODL is a thing for a reason people!
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:22:50
Hahaha are any millennials even in the position to consider investing in real estate?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:43:51
Would be nice but going to need more proof...
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:27:28
What are the benefits of that?
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:58:49
I'd be happy with the price at either of those numbers.
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:34:33
Stupid reddit disabled gold purchases. Maybe they will use lightning haha. Reddit has become a giant, slow moving, corporation.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:44:36
What does the inside look like?
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:59:55
What store is that in? Coffee shop with western union?
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:32:28
The next bubble pop will crash to $100k!!!! OH NOOOO!!!
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:28:58
Would have been nice to see pics of the merchants he has converted.
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:51:12
Perfect example of why blocks have to stay at 1MB!
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:11:33
Up, up, up you go bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:30:47
Buy da dip!
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:21:50
wooo adoption!
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:21:44
BTMFD!!! Question is when? All the time!
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:32:12
Wow indeed.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:46:08
Buy over a period of time. A bit every week over the span of a few months.
@_date: 2018-07-27 14:23:58
I'm one of the butterflies trying to lift that red bar up.
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:57:46
C'monnnnnn bull run!
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:36:24
damn right it is
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:23:10
We can dream! Might as well be a big dream.
