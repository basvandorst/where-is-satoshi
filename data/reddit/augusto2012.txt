No, thanks

That name though, it doesn't sound appealing now days
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:43:42
I honestly think is a good idea, but security is my main concern, if you ever get hacked they can steal all of your cryptocoins, I guess my advice is not to use the "MulticoinWallet" as your main wealth storage.

Have you had any luck with this? the code seems legit but do I zync it to my cex.io account?

Mean while, the creators of the 2008 financial crisis are still free
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:43:47
but then a sort of a troll renaissance occurred, it probably started on a youtube video comments.
@_date: 2015-03-22 07:01:40
Another misleading tittle
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:13:59
That's the joke, he's not joking.

Good lord, this guy has no shame, he should not be speaking.

Another victime of the war on drugs
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:28:46
And they still NOT telling us who the 3rd party auditor is.

$ 828.98 USD each lol, really? and if you wanna use it on exchange mode, you still gotta have a money transmitter license in the USA, in Florida you need a 100k networth to get licensed.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:38:13
beware of this link, RED FLAG.
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:12:44
Sarcastic much? lol

@_date: 2014-12-14 10:53:35
wow, guilty until proven innocent
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:03:47
Please, make it available for the US, I'd buy it in a second.

I bet Pablo Escobar would've loved Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:56:16
What bitcoin? what wallet?
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:23:32
This is China, I don't think payroll is such a burden though
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:16:15
Yes, you can schedule automate buying on coinbase, down side is that it buys it at whatever the price is at that time.

The irony of life
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:55:01
For real, that bitch needs to shut up, BTC haters everywhere lol
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:20:48
There was no "bail out" for them
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:57:11
I bet she's not even a girl, this is nothing but a spammer trying to sell mining contracts.
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:55:59
And we're suppose to trust you because... &lt;fill the blank&gt; 
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:24:08
ooh 1PH, watch out big baller
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:00:27
I'm guilty of this by being part of CEX, i guess BTC can't scape the human greed.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:21:45
If they dont give a fvck, let's DDoS the shit out of them, I bet they'd care after that.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:25:31
But back to the topic, so the state of Virginia shut down your business model, so I'm guessing all the states would take the same action, and to obtain a money transmission license is so difficult and expensive.
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:34:17
That was a close one, I'm glad to see the community being alert on the lookout, and small miners taking action.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:52:33
I feel bad for GodofredoSinicoCaspa, he's probably more confused now lol inanimate soda lol, Fizzy? really? wtf

Question: How is the IRS going to reinforce this new bitcoin taxation? I'd love to see IRS agents tracking the blockchain, every single wallet, every single block. lol
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:40:05
Auditing means sh!t if we don't know who's doing the audit, Bitstamp still not telling us who audited them, "An investor" yeah right. Nigg@ please!
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:58:49
I mean, what do you expect, Weed still illegal according to federal laws.
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:41:31
TD Bank is where  you need to go to do business with Coinbase, been doing it for a year and a half, so far so good.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:57:59
huh? the price is not dropping?? it's fucking diving, what are you smoking?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:38:33
The AUDITOR was Stefan Thomas, who is this guy and why should we believe him??, he claims he did not receive any compensation for the audit. sure thang! yeah right!
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:40:21
You just hit the Argentinian's ego by calling them a 2nd or 3rd world country lol the article even calls the exchange "the first Hispanic Exchange", Argentinians dont think they're even hispanics, they swear they're from another world.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:02:14
You're naive, FDIC doesnt have all that money either, to back up all deposits at once, what it is? insured up to $250,000, pssss yeah right
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:33:37
I think this is great NEWS, the exchanger will be able to accept: credit card reward points, hotel loyalty points, retail loyalty points), virtual currency, cash, BITCOINS, Facebook credits, eBay bucks, cash-equivalent currency.
@_date: 2014-09-07 04:01:17
It's not, not anymore, it used to be worth it when they had no trading fees, and lower hash maintenance fee, the only thing I recommend is their referrals plan

Not sure if you suffer from dogephobia or you just don't like Nascar.

Is that a toilet in the background? cause that's where that key belongs
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:06:31
That's exactly what I thought, I would've preferred Brasil, Colombia, Chile or even Peru over Argentina 
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:54:14
I've been looking everywhere, so far they always say "a 3rd party company" but never disclose who did the audit. 
In accounting, trust me dude, it matters a lot who does the auditing, it could be a fake auditing for all we know.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:05:44
I wonder how the Ecuadorian authorities are going to enforce this law
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:03:33
You're right, there's no basements in Florida, the building code doesnt allowe it 
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:21:17
It was the invalid security certificate that made me feel suspicious about your site.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:50:33
You're damn right, fck the feds

No debit cards allowed on Coinbase, only Credit Cards and it has to be VISA "God knows why"
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:52:54
How is the owner going to pay for property tax?
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:42:40
I never said I was buying from GOX, the GOX problem is dragging the price down on every exchange, that's how I'm buying cheap BTC from Coinbase
