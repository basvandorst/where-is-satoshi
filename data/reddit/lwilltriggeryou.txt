In my opinion no.  According to technical indicators Bitcoin is significantly over-bought. But that is just my opinion...that's the thing with investing/trading, there are two people that have the opposite viewpoint for every transaction that there is.

Look up how futures work. It's too tough to explain.

Taxes would be 35% if he held it less than a year...15% if held for more than a year.  If he really thinks he stands to lose 80% of his bitcoin value he'd be net positive by selling and then repurchasing.

Damn they need to come out with on before it crashes.  I think bitcoin will go up in the long term but it's bound to go down pretty significantly within the next 3 months.  Looking to make a pretty penny off of it.

Futures have unlimited risk so I'm trying to stay away from them.

My opinion is that they are running up the price as steeply as possible, then they will short it with futures, sell their massive stake, chasing out their coins for a quick profit but more importantly starting the crash of bitcoin.  Fear will lead to more sellers and they'll make massive money with their futures.

I don't care if it's fake or not...I only care what I can buy with it.

I'd love to get in bitcoin but I'm terrified of buying right now I really don't see how it won't crash soon.  When you have random people like me interested I think it's a bad sign.

If you believe it's going to crash, why not sell all of your coins, and then buy back in at a lower price so you could have more coins?
