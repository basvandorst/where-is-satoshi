Volatility never stopped banks. Just look at penny stocks, and bull/bear options. Or take a look at .  
And besides, bitcoin is as volatile as it gets in crypto, and yet that didn't stop the banks. If everyone praises eth for being more stable, there's only more reason for the banks to get in, not get away from.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:01:32
My theory is that greed is the biggest motivator behind big banks, does that make sense?  
So if there's money in it, the big banks will do it. Note these are the guys that have divisions to trade in wine and cigars.  
If outsiders like us can think of ways to get into crypto and make money, there's no reason to presume that the big banks haven't already figured that out. Remember, it's their job to be greedy.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:02:09
Now that just reads like wishful thinking, my friend.  
Do you really think all the ivy league grads that the big banks hired would not think of something so simple?   
If they can do it for bitcoin, yeah, they are doing for other cryptos too.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:25:27
Implying eth isn't also run by big banks.

He could have just "no comment", or simply "I don't know enough to express my opinion on it", or you know, "I cannot comment on it."  
But nooooo. He decided to take a stance. I respect him for the his knowledge and work ethics, and his humbleness when it comes to wealth. But other than that, he's just another overlord.

I'm not aware of any btc exchanges, "local" or overseas, being protected by any sort of regulation. Did I miss something?
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:03:34
And yet btc price still doesn't increase much...  
Edit: not saying btc is bad, it's just a objective description of what is happening. A few weeks ago we see high at $600+, now it's back to $500. Genuinely curious of what is happening.

yes, Oil is sold in US dollar, but still not officially pegged. EURO was adopted as an alternative oil payment currency for awhile a few years back... and then they stopped. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:18:21


Same for most fiat currency, but at least most of them are pegged against some other currencies or commodities.  
Unlike the US Dollar, which isn't pegged to anything and is thus literally "in God We Trust." And yet, there's an economic that worths trillions built onto of it.

A bunch of people overreacting.  
The rumor says the chinese gov is looking for ways to control/replace bitcoin exchange platforms, not controlling/replacing bitcoin. Basically to regulate money laundering and tighten up currency inflow/outflow.  
If it's true, that's good for bitcoin because then it'll be officially legit in China.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:04:52
If there's any shitty "closing sell," that'd be the exchanges themselves (for liquidity to handle users cashing out), because the users can just pay transaction fee and move their coins elsewhere.

They're already part of the game. It's a free market, and hence the richest groups dominate. That's what free market means - anyone with the most money will get what they want. They can make bullshit pseudo crashes like the JP Morgan FUD, and people will believe them everytime. Same with China.

Where do you find $220 btc? The Chinese market is trading at &gt;$300 (at least what chbtc is showing).
@_date: 2015-10-30 19:06:09
I don't think that's how price works... consider that there are people somewhere still holding millions of btc that they mined back at &lt;$1. Will the market crash to &lt;$1 if they do a whale dump then? Maybe, if they also sale at same the price point. But most sensible people won't, so they will be selling at market price... whatever that is.
