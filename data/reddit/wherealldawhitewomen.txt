I'll sum this up.  "I don't understand it.   The value shot up like crazy.  It's a bubble."
I think the Nobel team that awards the prize in economics needs to be composed of more non-traditionalists.  Basically what we have is a bunch of guys CONVINCED that the Sun revolves around the Earth because that's what they were taught.

Bitcoin is sent to Ebay owned address.  Ebay holds bitcoin until customer is satisfied.  If satisfied, Ebay sends bitcoin to merchant.  If unsatisfied, Ebay holds bitcoin until merchant receives shipment back. 
Everything else is just a policy change.  Heck it would work out better for everyone.

My argument still stands.  Your point is that as price rises, volume will go down in total btc.  That's a given.  Problem is, the price is not rising AND volume is going down--not good.

Hmm..so for instance is there a way for someone to sign something on blockchain.info proving an address belongs to them.

Have 10 or so people call restaurants around the area and ask if they accept bitcoin yet like the nearby competition plans to.  Have them tell each restaurant that others in the area said in a few weeks and then just say thanks and hang up.
Heck...a lot of folks should be organized in doing this here.

What if someone else just has a bitcoin client and I need to verify they own an address, can they send me a message verifying it?

Thanks guys..thanks everyone!

The Nobel Prize in Economics is certainly a bubble.  It seems to award an overabundance of idiots with very little clarity in the process.
"Best economic minds on the planet claim math and open source code is unclear."
In their defense perhaps they are idiot savants?
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:37:26
Actually bitcoiners could unite in doing this and then having people nearby actually go to those places and ask.
If the perception is everyone is asking AND the competition is doing it, it will happen.

Who the hell would buy a non-decentralized currency at this point?  You do know what that means right?

You guys need to STOP complaining and START doing.  This will only happen if folks DO.  
Here's what to do.  Have 5-10 of your Bitcoin buddies start calling local businesses around you that you'd like to spend bitcoin at.  Ask them WHEN they are accepting bitcoin like the other nearby businesses are going to.  If they say they aren't just say...Hmmm....Ok...thanks...like they will be missing out and hang up.  You basically build buzz and fear of lost revenue this way.  The same place should be called at least 3 times by different people preferably a few days to a week apart.
Another guerrilla tactic would be to slyly stick a "Bitcoin coming soon" sticker at local businesses next to their Visa,Mastercard signs, etc. Now this is REALLY pushing it but it will get folks asking them about it.

This needs to be upvoted to the top guys!!

I'm looking at weekly volume.  If volume dies too much, BitPay won't work and Tigerdirect will not accept Bitcoin.  Volume is EXTREMELY important.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:16:53
Yes, because logic is idiotic.

GoldCoin already has a 51% protection they created.  Just copy that--geesh.
