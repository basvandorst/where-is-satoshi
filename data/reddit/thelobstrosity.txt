I have yet to finish the series. This summer, I probably will.  
Such an amazing story.

That's true. It'd take a good deal of unnecessary paperwork.  
Perhaps Prypto cards or the equivalent would be a better candidate.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:04:29
Oh hell yes.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:14:23
That's actually rather classy.

I cracked up at "Meta double-ironically guilty"

Any chance there could be a "Bitcoin back" option alongside cash back?

Thank you kindly.

The BTC car is cool too.

Gotta curl that pinky, bro.
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:23:44
You know it! :)
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:13:57
Such cool bro  
Having any crypto on a car would be beneficial to all cryptos.  
And they are fellow redditors, after all.

Thanks for helping me rack up the SATs. :)

He's also anti-big banks, so that kinda ties in with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:27:00
Enjoy!  
Some of the books can get a little slow, but it's part of the experience.

For the record, you can get this design on [6 dollar shirts](
@_date: 2016-06-02 00:58:52
Positive. Yes! Bitcoin. Push!
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:05:39
I'd be willing to commission a personalized design if you're looking for something specific.

I'm moving out to LA in 2 days. I'll have to stop by!

This makes me incredibly happy. Last time I got an e-mail about a new special being available on his site, I wrote back asking if they'd consider accepting bitcoin and/or dogecoin. Didn't expect an answer or anything, but wanted to float it out there.  
You bet I'll be supporting with bitcoin this time.

It's great that a lot of vape shops seem to harbor Bitcoin ATMs. They're two markets facing fundamentally similar laws, rooted in public and federal uncertainty, with die-hard supporters to match.  
I kicked cigarettes and got into vaping around the same I got into crypto, and noticed parallels from the get-go.

I've been getting into Joe Rogan's podcast and listened to one of the Andreas episodes today, where this was brought up.

Meanwhile, I'm banned from paypal for unknowingly redeeming a stolen paypal code, purchased on lbc by an acquaintance.

There was once a time when I asked Alex Green if I could buy a Moolah shirt.

A bitcoin proponent with the funding to do so.

My phone has a failing battery, so I was trying to conserve it the best I could to send people tips. Photographers took several pictures of us though, and I believe might have some shots.  
I'll be sure to post them if I find any.  
  
Edit: Happy cakeday! 1000 bits.

They want dumps.

There are probably planets largely composed of gold, or used to be, before they were mined out by aliens.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:50:46
You're welcome. Time flies, huh?  
I'm not sure if it read the tip since it was an edit. just in case, here: 1000 bits

I saw a car in Los Angeles with the license plate "SATOSHI"
