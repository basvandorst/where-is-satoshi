I'm not 'trying to say' something, I'm straight up saying that male domination of space is a stand alone serious issue for society. There may also be other social issues that aren't gender based, but they don't have to be part of the same conversation.
It's really creepy when men try to pick this kind of stuff apart, then all agree with each other, cos it feels quite a lot like they're trying to keep more male dominated spaces. That is creepy as fuck because you wonder what people are planning once they've silenced any kind of scrutiny.
Even if that's just sitting around, wearing fedoras and being wankers.

Your question contains the premise that I'm saying something I'm not. I am a man and have very much been threatened myself. These were in different contexts though, so I don't see why they need to be part of the same discussion.
I was once persistently, if ineffectively attacked by a bare chested french graffiti artist who'd taken hallucinogens. If there were hints that bitcoin meetups were facilitating the kind of environment that might recreate this experience I'd be highlighting to everyone the importance of tackling the underlying causes.
In the experiences of the OP there is a very clear pattern which people will recognise. It's an issue society knows well and knows how to deal with.
It's not the only issue, but how is that even a point?
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:30:38
It's definitely possible to use bitcoin without going to meetups, but surely we're better off as users if these do take place, even if we don't go to them ourselves.
And surely it's easier to tackle the issue of creepy behaviour than to try to continue the project having given up on meatspace.

I have a young daughter and live in the UK where there are a number of free or cheap daytime activities where we can go. When I take my daughter to these places I'm invariably the only man and it's hard to know how to navigate the situation. It's generally regarded as pretty difficult for men to socialise in these places and other men have discussed it as a barrier to them visiting these places, and potentially as the determining factor if whether they or their partners will work, regardless of who has the better employment option.
This is something very different to having your personal space invaded though. The problem of male dominated spaces is not just women feeling excluded, but often also feeling unsafe. I've got very little time for men who don't see this is a serious issue.
I've never been to a Bitcoin meetup, but this doesn't strike me as particularly surprising. If this is representative it's a serious deal for likely adoption. If women don't feel comfortable in bitcoin space then that's half the population alienated straight away. And my instinct would be that other huge sections of society might have similar experiences, be it because of their race, sexuality, age, disability, or any other possible characteristic.
If so the whole thing's pretty screwed as an idea, because the majority of the world's population isn't looking for an alternative protocol to move value more efficiently, they're more likely hoping for a world where they're not subject to this degrading experience. So they're not going to be interested.
And the tiny proportion of the population that are able bodied heterosexual white adult middle class men aren't worth bothering with if it's to the exclusion of all others

I clicked on some things and got the price listed in bitcoin, but I think it might be set up wrong because it listed each pair as 0.99 bitcoin, which is about £600 at the moment here in the UK!

In truth the guy distributing it was a bit under confident so it would be more accurate to say I saw his stall and went over and told him I wanted to give him my details and could he give me one of his nice fliers.

By ancap I mean anarcho-capitalist. Here I just mean it in relation to your statement that you imagine the future will be anarcho-capitalist, regardless of whether you think that's a good thing.
I don't think anarcho-capitalism is at all believable, because without the state I don't see why the vast majority would consider adhering to the rules of capitalism (because they're barbaric and illogical). The state is the mechanism which the capitalist uses to keep the system functioning.
The only futures I see are fascism or an end to capitalism.
Socialism or barbarism if you will
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:58:42
The thing I don't get about anarcho-capitalists is why they think people will respect private property once the state is removed as the force that protects it. Most ancaps seem to think the fact they are willing to arm themselves somehow outweighs the willingness of those on the losing end of capitalist relationships to arm themselves.
I'm a proletarian and work in a car factory to feed myself and my family. There are billions of us globally and in comparison the number of people with significant capital assets is tiny. If it wasn't for the state to protect your wealth we'd overrun you in days
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:07:36
Mate, you aren't going to convince anyone whose actually used the NHS that it isn't a good thing. The only debate we have here is how to fund it. You sound like an American, because that debate literally doesn't happen here
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:06:59
And you just went full ideology. You know what, you're scared of anything that has even the whiff of socialism or communism in it because you swallowed a whole heap of propaganda. The fact is our health system has worked for years while many of the ones more market driven ones, and especially the US one, are vastly less efficient. Unless of course you're some kind of eugenicist and want to kill off people with worse genes or something (again, total ideology).
Sometimes I can't wait for the American empire to finally collapse and at least global political discussion will get a little bit more intelligent.

The BBC is running a live blog which they reserve for big developing news. Here is the latest update:
"I'm a general med doctor in the emergency acute dept.  Phones and PCs down at West Middlesex Hospital."

You're not from round here are you?! You don't get far in many conversations dissing the NHS or calling the sick parasites in the UK. Our health service is a mutual benefit to all and increases the health of everyone collectively. And it is widely supported by the most productive members of society, the workers that do fricking everything

Please, don't visit.
Anyway, I have met anti-statists, but what we don't have much of is pro-market anti-statists. I'm personally anti-state, but I'm more fundamentally anti-market. I'd like to see the end of capitalism and luckily it looks like it's on the way out. What right wing anti-statists (I mean jeez you have literally the biggest state in the history of the world) don't get is that if it wasn't for the state there/their/they're could be no market. The state creates the space where the market operates and smoothes out all its/it's contradictions.
So you new breed of evangelical capitalists are going around preaching is about having "smaller states" while you have the biggest military the world has ever seen. I'm sure on the inside that all makes sense, but from outside it looks totally bonkers

The NHS is massively better than the privatised alternatives and was better before they started to introduce market structures into it

We are a massively densely populated country. We need the most efficient health service possible, which we have.

I'm struggling as a Brit on the bitcoin subs the past 24 hours. There's been a lot of anti-NHS comments from market fundamentalists. I can only assume their Americans (they won't say) because I've never met a British person who doesn't think the NHS is great. Even the people who want to privatise it have to pretend they don't and tell us stories of how it looked after their sick kids...
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:00:11
Just to clarify this is a terrible story with other features (such as an already controversial massive digitisation project) that will probably grab most of the coverage, but I suspect there'll be a bit of "what's bitcoin" going along with it.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:33:15
It's bad news because people will probably die. And who cares whether or not this increases the value of your bitcoin you freaking weirdo!

You also sound like a total Nazi calling the sick parasites.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:00:56
I wrote the headline between juggling (not literally) kids and viewing a house. Bitcoin was on the front page of the BBC website as it appeared in the image that was being circulated. With my skewed perspective I suspected that bitcoin would be made part of the story, but perhaps that didn't happen, which is frankly probably a good thing for bitcoiners as this isn't something we want to be associated with. I made some comments to this effect straight after posting but they'll be down the bottom cos they were quite dull!
(So I don't think it's fair to say I made shit up)

How are you going to earn money in the UK without relying on the labour of workers who are kept alive by the health service?
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:00:44
That's why the state not only a) arms itself to the teeth to enforce it's laws of private property, but also b) provides us with welfare as a political concession to diffuse our anger at our exploitation
@_date: 2013-08-22 12:57:23
That's a fair point! It would also prove the principle, so I guess I should give it a go.

Just a quick thought on the pricing of USB miners. Is it not possible a lot of the retail sales are in fiat. In which case thinking about the price we need to consider the difficulty of turning fiat into bitcoin. Buyers may consider this a reliable way to get some bitcoin, the price of which they expect to rise.
I live in the UK where buying bitcoin is a bit of a chore.

I should really have done the sums before sending it, but I just checked and I think the standard transaction fee is about 40p (£0.40)

I guess also her point is about regulation. With bitcoin there will be less, so won't this mean more criminality. My opinion is that the 'regulation' in finance is pretty ineffective at anything other than protecting financial institutions from competition. Due to the power of financial institutions they can commit crime with impunity, so remove their artificial advantage and society could hold them to account.
Or more simply: governments love crime!
But I guess I'm saying the same thing.

@_date: 2013-08-10 21:12:03
The likelihood of this is reduced in part at least because bitcoin has developers who work on improvements. Also bitcoin users would benefit in many ways from an improved alternative currency, as they would be able to use it, so it's only a risk to the extent that bitcoin holdings could lose their value. But bitcoin isn't really something to hold on to, it's something to use. Any speculation has to be pretty short term because of what you describe and similar.
