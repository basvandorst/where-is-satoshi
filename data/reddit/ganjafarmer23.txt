No one knows if helicopter-money = inflation. It's just one more tool, it may fail and do nothing. One quote in the article from an economist that hints at helicopter money and people assume that's what every CB is going to do now. 
Only think that's actually a bit interesting about the article is that they partially admit that central bankers are not the demi-gods of the economy anymore.

Keep your "lesson" to yourself. You want to hold in your own wallet, fine, but traders is the sole reason your bitcoins is worth anything.
How about HODL AND STFU??
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:54:05
You know, there's quite a few people around who aren't just limited to BUY AND HODL strategy with their coins. People can have funds for margin lending, active trading or simple hedging. We know the risk, and for that reason a lot keep their funds diversified across exchanges to limit the risk of an exchange fucking up.
Please don't assume people are just retarded. For many, BUY AND HOLD in your hardware wallet or whatever wallet is just not viable.

Could you guys maybe delay legal action until withdrawals are enabled again? Just so everyone who understand that the money is gone, can get their remaining funds out of bfx.
I should say i'm in exact same position as you. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:19:26
Probably because most who had funds on finex understand that the money is lost no matter what, and just want to get what they can and never come back..
But sure, let's go all "this is unacceptable" and maybe in 5 years we get the satisfaction of being right. Probably ending up with less of our money that we could. 
The market should punish them anyway for their fuckup, so hopefully they'll be completely irrelevant or out of business soon enough

So, you guys want okcoin to lock every account that had a big short position or what? Price action before the hack suggested the most obv short opportunity you can get.

inflation in money supply isn't even remotely correlated with price inflation
@_date: 2016-04-29 08:12:24
I think what you say about fraud etc, is a product of oligarchy not the idea of a bank. The solution to government debt is pretty simple, just eliminate it, because politicians can't control it, and they've always fucked it up. Limit the cost of government to  something like 5% of GDP and fund it by increase in money supply. The idea that x increase in money supply means x increase in inflation is just dead wrong. Check the correlation yourself, because there isn't any.
You could probably do this with blockchain-based money.
Even if Bitcoin succeeds, most people will buy it for the same reason they buy gold, and that's not to spend it. Who else than highly ideological people will buy their coffee with Bitcoin? It's much better as an asset to park capital in when everything turns to shit.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:02:38
That's not true, hyperinflation has only occurred in instances of extreme political instability and/or war. 
You think helicopter money will magically reverse this chart?? 
Money velocity is the only useful indicator on inflation/deflation. You'll find that the chart you linked to my other comment, money velocity tracked the money supply until early 2000s. People are clearly hoarding money rather than spending them. Helicopter money won't stop people hoarding. You'd just give them more to hoard.

It's derivaties contracts, so the value of the contract is denominated in Bitcoin regardless if you buy or sell it. It's probably the same model as 1broker and simplefx where the owners act as market makers, i don't see how they can guarantee order execution at fixed spreads at any time without being market makers.
You obviously need quite a lot of bitcoin in margin to do that, but it's a safe business model, considering the average performance of retail traders.
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:38:03
You can't see you just stated your opinion of what money is? Money  can be pretty much anything as long as it's an agreed medium of exchange. Japan used ricebags for 600 years, because there was zero trust in the emperors money. Tea in China, cattle before gold was used, it doesn't matter.
You guys think you can equate everything to the "evil fiat money", because you think it inherently inflates, but the culprit has always been governments who mismanage everything because they build the structure of society with bigger piles of debt all the time. If you think a symptom is the cause, you don't know what you're talking about.
Even with a Bitcoin standard, if governments are still building the society with debt, eventually the standard would just break after some time, like all other pegs before it.
You're just using the same arguments as apocalyptic goldbugs do. It's always the same. There's nothing wrong with banks or fiat money, but there's something very wrong with decades of corrupt politicians, which has developed the financial world into the oligarchy we have today.
A lender of last resort for the private sector is a good thing, because there will always be financial panics regardless of what is money. Even if Bitcoin became the world currency, it will not beat the business cycle
@_date: 2016-04-25 04:24:00
If you have no idea how to trade, do yourself a favor and invest small like 2-5% of your savings. You might feel bummed out over not investing more way down the line, but that's nothing compared to the feelings you'll experience if you're dead wrong about this.
If you really want to invest more, then learn how to trade. Bitcoin is actually one of the easiest markets to trade.

That's pretty retarded to say. Hopefully central banks will revert to their original purpose, a lender of last resort and nothing else. Instead of having an impossible task of managing the economy through monetary policies and also keep unemployment low. It's just not possible with those tools in the long run. Adding the fact that the world is dominated by complete fiscal mismanagement by politicians, it's even more impossible.
It's not like the world was an economic fairy tale before central banks came along. Read some fucking history.

@_date: 2014-04-03 08:51:47
The reason for drop in value is the news from PBOC in china. Which isn't really news, it's just them enforcing what they said early december. OKCoin, Bter and btc38 is affected AFAIK. So to me it looks like a lot of panic and some opportunists with a lot of liquidity taking advantage. 
The event on 14 april( i read 15th i think, but irrelevant) is supposed to be the PBOC banning banks from working with exchanges. But it's more than likely only to be concerned third-party payment processers. It will no doubt make the life of exchanges more difficult, but by no means impossible.

I think the middle ground is the most likely scenario as well. I dont see the worldwide adoption as a scenario unless the entire financial system melts down. Who knows, the US, EU and China are well on the way.
Even then, it would be as a store of value, not everyday currency. I would say a digital currency that adopts some of the fiat currencies traits is needed for that. A national deflationary currency would have a negative impact on that nation's output. The inverse relationsship between inflation and unemployment must be thought of as well.

This whole debate is just retarded by now. Both sides look like fucking idiots. 
Incumbents always fail. Maybe it's time Core realizes not all users share their ultra-libertarian views, and most certainly future users wont if Bitcoin is ever to go mainstream. 
Bitcoin has a unique opportunity in the current economic climate. It would be sad to see Bitcoin fail to take advantage of that because of Core's complete unwillingness to accept other views on Bitcoin than their own. 
It would be nice to have devs that just work to make Bitcoin the best it can be in the real world.

It would be nice to have someone in charge who understands what role bitcoin can and cannot have in an economy. And i don't need any technical capabilities to understand what it can do.

Well yes, i understand that, and the debate should continue until we know whether it's going to happen or not.

If Core would just compromise and do a 2 mb hard fork, there wouldn't be so much support for Classic would there. There are too many different actors in Bitcoin now to get their "perfect" vision of what they think Bitcoin should be.
Already so much mining support for Classic. So it looks like now, it's just a matter of time, unless of course Core just does it themselves. Even if they highly disagree.

Not like this is even remotely different with the Bitcoin-services that exist today. Not until there's actual peer-to-peer payments. That is still so far away, i don't know why anyone would accept the volatility risk in their business model. 
I used Xapo for the first time to pay for some Airbnb accommodation recently and got fucked over on the exchange rate by 20 USD. So a little less than 5% actual fee for using Bitcoin through them. If i didn't pay in euros i would have another 3% added. But at least i understand their business model now.

I suspect the reality of what Bitcoin actually is, is quite different from the official narrative. If retail investors ever gets into Bitcoin in big numbers, it will be because of the same reasons as why retail investors buy gold, with zero intention of actually spending the Bitcoins.

My problem lies with Core having an apparent total disregard to the wishes of a big chunk of the private sector, mining community and normal users on the basis that "they know better". Even if they do know what's best, their management of this entire debate has been terrible. And with the support Classic has already achieved, it looks like the hard fork will happen regardless of what SegWit can do.

Why don't you just hedge your holdings in times like these? why just HODL and take a 20-25%(or whereever this ends up) hit. You can learn all you need in less than a day, and a save yourself from feeling like shit if you're way in red now.

This sums it up very nice. I already hate politics in normal life, to see it in Bitcoin is nasty. But this is like watching two religious groups arguing about which god is the right one. They will never agree. I think one group has to win before this is over.
I'm not that technical, but it seems to me that one group is very idealistic about Bitcoins future and the other more realistic. I'd prefer the latter.
Bitcoin is not going to change the entire world. Just because you yourself see a potential for Bitcoin, doesn't mean other people will. This vision of an incredibly diverse and decentralized Bitcoin is just utopia IMO. In time, what kind of individual is going to run a full node that takes up TBs of space?? The answer to that would be businesses IMO. So maybe they are more important than Core would like them to be.
Developers are not economists. The potential for a much bigger demand for Bitcoin is huge in the next five years. The safe haven of government debt won't be a thing anymore. Capital doesn't evaporate, it just concentrates in other sectors. It will be a massive shift from public to private. The similarities between now and the late 1920s are incredible. Europe will fail again(as it did in 1932 or 33) because of flawed politicians who think they can manage the business cycle into perpetuity. For anyone that follows news abit, it should be clear to anyone they are loosing control. Already many countries are paying 5-10% of government revenue in interest payment on past debt, and this is with rates at zero. Rates WILL start to rise, the ECB are powerless to prevent a sell-off in longterm debt, so interest payment will skyrocket for governments.
If Bitcoin is not there to be an attractive asset to park capital for individuals, then why would it ever be in the future?? Why would Bitcoin be a thing in 20 years when economies are no longer in a decline?
Scale now, or GTFO. These conditions will be perfect for Bitcoin to thrive and to be an actual thing for common people. So it should be the best it can be ASAP.

the chart already suggested downside was imminent.
It's just a perfect excuse to dump in a market that was already heading down. The situation with Core is the exact same as during the pump. Bitcoin traders are so emotional + very thin orderbooks so this just happens sometimes. Not like it's the first time Bitcoin has taken a giant shit.
It's not like people just woke up and took a rational decision to sell because of Core. It's just fear and any market can experience that.
@_date: 2016-01-18 11:13:36
Forgive me, but if a hard fork is going to happen anyway, why isn't it better having Core get onboard with it? I don't give a fuck about anyones vision now, if Bitcoin's going to hard fork better have it as smooth as possible.

if u just bothered doing simple correlation analysis.

I think you should check out what happened during the last sovereign debt crisis, ~1850 and late 1920s/early 1930s.

You have zero idea how many will turn to Bitcoin for this. If it's only about preserving capital, probably not that many will choose an asset as risky as Bitcoin.

What you are saying is human nature is bad. How are you going to prevent human nature? It's a fool's game. The majority will always be wrong in this, that's just how markets work. If people lose a shitload of money in a speculative frenzy, that's just life IMO. People could also have a sense of responsibility, but most don't and that is entirely their own problem to work on. Whenever a big top is in, so many blame everyone but themselves for their mistake. That's also human nature, you're not going to change that.
If Bitcoin is going to change the world in any way, it'll be way past the bubble. Stuff like this just doesn't happen linearly.

Of course it was a bubble, just like railroad companies were once in a huge bubble. They will always happen in new technologies that can change the world. Why do people think bubbles are so bad? You can't prevent basic human nature.

@_date: 2017-11-21 16:32:31
I'm saying that history has shown that bubbles are inevitable in new technologies with the potential to change the world. Trying to prevent bubbles is the same line of thinking economists have had for decades, trying to prevent the business cycle by assuming linear growth is possible. I wouldn't say that has turned out so well with the shit we see today. Small interventions now always create huge changes in the long run that humans cannot possibly forecast.
I don't see a problem with bubbles if the end result in the long run is much better. Without the bubble we would never see the amount of capital and talent pouring in to crypto right now. This lays the foundation for the actual use cases in the long run.

Your point is very simple to understand, it's just hopelessly naive. "Fixing it", good luck, talk to Vinny Lingham about how he fared back in Januray trying to "prevent the bubble". The railroad bubble or the dot-com bubble did not implode their respective industries, it's not even remotely true. Both laid the foundation for future growth, the one where the actual use cases are realised. 
Seriously what do you expect? That if we just sat down and made some rules, we could have linear growth and everyone would win? No one should be allowed to lose money?
Unwillingness to accept some short term pain for a collective greater in the long run is selfish.

How they will achieve it with so many dollars in circulation outside the US, i have no idea. I don't know if they are just naive or completely retarded, any sane person will just park their capital in private assets. anything should be better than 1-2-3 % in negative rate.

If this fee market develops without another workable solution(i guess that would be LN, but it don't really understand it), Bitcoin will enter whats commonly known in business administration as a death spiral. Low fees are a significant product for many parts of the ecosystem, whether they like that or not. Until they can replace that product with something else, i don't see how a fee market wont cause significant damage to Bitcoin, at least in the short term.
Maybe they should hire some economic advisers. I'd like to see if they can find just a few economists, who would say rising product costs will have no consequences.

@_date: 2017-04-19 12:51:43
That doesn't prove speculation is dead in Bitcoin at all. Only thing you can say is that speculation has a smaller impact on price than in altcoins. Which is pretty much stating the obvious. Is price action from dec '16 to now all non-speculative demand in your minds or what? 
I hope one day you will learn that value isn't strictly deterministic
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:58:17
i know it's not really the same, since the market decides the fees, but the reasoning behind is the same. They see fees needing to rise to maintain same level of security, so they want a higher price of the product(transactions). That kind of thinking has meant the death of many companies since forever really.

No, they added tether as a market, you can TRADE for USD. If you think all is OK, then you can buy 1$ bills at 91 cents right now, that seems like a bargain, no?

Nothing has ever proven to be store of value long-term, and no asset will as long as people are involved. This whole idea of perpetual appreciation of bitcoin in the long-term is nothing but utopia.
Bitcoin is under the same rules as any other market, and nothing goes up or down forever.

In this case, a short covering rally. People betting against a price increase being forced to close positions. This results in buying pressure. You can see on the liquidations on OKcoin futures yourself. It's a graveyard. 
I dont follow you assessment that this doesn't happen in other assets. In bitcoin and other crypto it seems the market is on cocaine some times. If you zoom out on the timeframe on other assets, you'll see the same pattern.
Bitcoin is manipulated for sure, but not perpetually. So many traders are retail here and use high leverage for their positions, so all they need is a little push and they panic. In a illiquid market, this results in big moves.
No one can tell you exactly why this happens. No single reason IMO, i think three reasons with bitcoin makes sense, a little push, forced liquidations and herd mentality in the market.
@_date: 2016-09-19 09:13:56
I think of Bitcoin as a far-right/far-left small political party. That can't really explain how it's going to convince the rest of the world why their views is the truth. 
Everyone knows the technology is here to stay, but i think it's stupid to just assume Bitcoin's properties are "just right". 
The weakest link for me is developers. The way they handled the blocksize debate should be concern for all. I don't have faith in their rational decisionmaking when inevitably the pressure in future situations might be much greater.
Bitcoin is good for a hail-mary investment opportunity but that's it. I think it's really bad advice to bet everything on bitcoin.

I don't follow you.. When i did my purchases on steam a few days ago, you just need to make the transactions within 15 min, you don't need to wait for confirmation. As soon as transaction is registered on network, they should credit your account. That's what happened for me when i used it. I was actually shown the same page you linked, but my account was credited anyway.
So maybe they did fuck something up. Or BitPay did. Or you did.

This is the one of the most bearish bullmarkets in history. Everyone says this will end so badly, but they all end up buying higher each time.
No way stocks are looking at a major 50% crash. Look at the bond market, there's no room to move here.
If you want a crash look at the bond market, it's the biggest bubble in history. And that would actually be properly bullish for bitcoin.

Probably a lot here now who have never experienced what real China FUD can do to price. It can be completely meaningless FUD and price can still tank 30% or more.

But this has already been tried before as he said, and it's not a story of success. It's an incredibly poor system to absorb financial shocks. What's to stop banks from issuing more currency than it's reserves? 
I have hard time seeing how you can control banks in every way. Otherwise, if you get a financial crisis, you'd just end up with a wave of banking defaults. Imagine the effect on people after a couple decades with banking defaults. There would be bank runs all the time. 
This is from a description of the events of the financial panic in 1830s-40s. 


I think it was this event where states ended up issuing IOU's to bail out the banks. 9 states defaulted on their debt in 1841-42. 
The issues faced back then would arguably be of much smaller magnitude today as banking transparency would be in high demand. Still doesn't leave much room for error, a proper black swan event could easily trigger a cascade of defaults, where even the most honest and transparent banks would be at risk.

You could ask 20 different people and they'd give 20 different reasons for the recent rise in price. And there is probably more reasons to the rise than that. It's not so simple as a single cause and effect.
In the end, way too many people use fundamentals to fit a predetermined conclusion that Bitcoin is bullish and call it analysis.
Markets trade in anticipation of events, it's the reason you say "buy the rumor, sell the news", so this could just as easily be speculators anticipating a Chinese buying spree. It doesn't have to materialize.
If enough people think something will happen markets can move a lot. Look at gold the rally into 2011 was largely due to people anticipating bank failures, it never materialized and the rally ended.

Just bots buying and selling into their own orders do ramp up volume. Bitfinex seems like the only major exchange where you can somewhat trust the volume.
It's incredibly obivious, but somehow most traders always think they are going to outsmart everyone. They just end up being free pressure for whatever direction the market/whales will take. A long and boring consolidation after last drop with bearish sentiment, meant the path of least resistance would clearly be up. Take it as a gift, when you see it for no apperent reason, it's just the whales singing that they are about to do something. Bitcoin traders are so emotional compared to other markets, all they need is a little push.

That millennial argument doesn't really stack up with Core advocating for strict meritocracy in protocol development. Their opinion is more valid that yours because they have continuously shown to have MERIT to have that opinion.

Most altcoin whales are bitcoin whales, and they STILL just want more bitcoin. Bitcoin could fall to 10-15 % market share, and the game would still be the same thing. The only people who thinks otherwise are small-time investors and developers.

Just because indicators turn bullish in theory, you think it means price has to follow? There's nothing out of the ordinary here, big moves followed by prolonged chop is the norm in Bitcoin. Also, the spread on Bitstamp has been huge for ages.
You really ask why indicators doesn't give the result it should every time? It's kinda in the name.. an INDICATOR. If you religiously follow indicator strategies, i guarantee you're going to have a bad time in the long run. It's simply not that easy mate.

Best plot twist if title is true, not that i think price will skyrocket or something, but large amounts of coin getting off the market is somewhat bullish, not something to be bearish about. If government ends up with large amounts of coin, it'll be auctioned off. I don't see why they would abandon that practice.
I don't think it's true, most likely they just have some close ties to the guy that was arrested. Wouldn't be surprised to see btc-e back online soon with no explanation, because it's btc-e(they tweeted 5-10 days). Would also be short-term bullish if they did as everyone has to buy crypto to get out
If dumps are coming soon, they will happen regardless of this.

Transaction cost, if you give a shit about that. And a lower price. Bitcoiners look at other coins and perceive their gains has been at bitcoins cost.
