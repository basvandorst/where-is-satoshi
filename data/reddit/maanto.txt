Yeah, at first I automatically thought of myself as "poorer" since I only have a few micro bitcoins. 
But after I thought about it for a while, I was like...wait I didn't lose any BTCs (well maybe slightly considering electricity spent, and being out-hashed by people who can afford hardware). 
Still, I'm fine with people getting BTC in exchange for their money spent on hardware. I certainly will not refuse BTC, but I don't think it's the wave of the future everyone is saying it is.

Yes, a major rule of hyping a new technology is to assume your audience has a 3rd grade education. 
One of the problems I still see whenever watching anyone's introduction to bitcoin video, is that they always go straight to the physical coin comparison. 
I wish there was a part 2, that would go into a little detail about how there are no physical coins. I find when explaining the tech to people, the hardest thing to explain, and for new users to comprehend is the digital aspect. 
Anyway, good video. I'm intrigued.

How feasible would it be for the US government to seize Bitcoins, seize the instance of the exchange, or intercept information on clients in a particular jurisdiction?
 I don't think feasibility matters to the IRS. They will seize/freeze whatever they want, whenever they want. Or did you mean how likely is it that they would intercept the money/BTC on a per-transaction basis? As long as this company (Buttercoin) is registered with FinCEN, it might be less likely to incur their ire. 
See these articles for more information. I probably am 50% talking out my ass.

I think offline paper wallets would replace the fiat bills in this instance, so not much difference. I don't know if I'd call that cold storage, though.

I was thinking the exact same thing. He has a quite righteous beard too.

I understand where HuggableBear is coming from on this; don't say anything that may hurt the cause/don't speak if it's not going to be constructive or you know it will have a positive impact. 
However, it's that same fear to ask questions and address serious problems that has caused the US to decline in greatness. 
I am by no means a super patriot/nationalist, but I do think we should give each politician an equal chance to present their arguments, and assess them on equal grounds. 
Just because other politicians and pundits mock one of their colleagues does not mean we should immediately respond in kind.
