It’s not an acronym BUT it is a backronym. Also, Idk why you had to make the distinction between “deer” and “dear”; one is an animal. I’m guessing you didn’t know which one wasn’t the animal so you were covering your bases.

I don't think so either. Curious to what he means lol

Do you think this is the beginning of the overdue 30-50% correction?

Are you saying you can trust the government?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:24
what are you thinking is happening?

I don't know if I share the same feelings, but that's okay =)

more people and the fear of missing out.

In your opinion, does the value of 2x coins apply to people with relatively small investments in BTC? I don't see the value for smaller fish. If so, could you explain? Thanks!

coinbase.com is the easiest

Assuming long term, that bit coin stands the test of time and continues to go up then you would say invest before. Can you explain why? Is it because of the free coins from the split?
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:07:40
Would you mind sharing your own insight as to why. Also, do you mean both as in buy now and after the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:32:44
why do you think that? the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:26:16
Do you see any type of substantial dip prior to the fork? So far it's been pretty solidly rising.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:44:42
I'm ready to invest in bitcoin, but not sure if I should now, or after the fork? Any opinions on this?
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:44:51
See this is what my gut instinct is telling me. There is no true "free" especially for small fish with very aggressive experienced traders.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:21:05
new to bitcoin. i want to invest. should i invest now or after the fork? and why?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:51:07
Okay. So there is substantial value in the extra forked coins. Got it. Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:43:39
i'm talking about a more substantial investment than $20, but thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:44:03
So you don't see any value in the free coins for the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:36:34
Who is an expert? lol It sure looks like that's whats going. Thanks man.
