HELL YES I would! I'd tell everyone I know about it!
Thanks for that!

This has the info I want but it doesn't have a widget. :-(

Actually, if you could share that spreadsheet, that'd be extremely helpful! Is it pulling the value from BitStamp or another exchange in real time? I can work from there.

6% is a little high. 3-3 1/2% is more average.
If you wanna PM me, that'd be cool. If not, I understand as well. :-)

I know one of their employees and know for a fact that HD wallets are in the plans. I know [CoinJoin]( is also something they are really looking at.

You seem like a cool, hungry guy. Here's a burger. @_date: 2014-05-18 23:04:09
Right!? I bought my first bitcoins at or below $10. It seems crazy that its sitting around $450 now.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:55:16
No, that's probably safe as it's associated with an Amazon account.
That being said, it's little information leaks like that that people always tend to figure out the most clever "uses" for.
Everything in this video should have been JUST for this video. Using a blockchain.info account with 9BTC in it probably wasn't ideal.

Man.... you are quite the double-speaker. I wasn't saying its fixing problems or advancing cash. In fact.... it was you who said, an I quote, "Bitcoin is *evolutionary* and not *revolutionary*."
This whole thread is about how they aren't the same and YOU have been the one saying it was all the same and just a different protocol. We've been saying that's not the case.
I don't even know what you're arguing anymore because it's not at all in line with what the discussion started with.
@_date: 2014-04-14 04:06:52
That's awesome to hear (!) but I can't seem to find it. Is it in the Play Store?
If not, could you shoot me a link to an apk so I can sideload it?
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:54:52
I've used it 3 times.

Well you are being extremely unhelpful. If I'm wrong, tell me why I'm wrong and be helpful instead of just being a jerk about it.
These are two chrome extensions I have. I have put public addresses into the right one and it has determined that those addresses have a grand total of 0.91 BTC (value ***x*** in my above comment). The number on the left is the current value of BTC according to Bitstamp at the time of the screenshot (value ***y***). Tell me how multiplying these two numbers together doesn't equal the current market value of the total amount of coins being tracked by the extension on the right?
If I'm doing something wrong here... then it's DRASTICALLY wrong because it means I have misunderstood bitcoin for the last 3+ years.
So please, tell me how I'm doing it wrong instead of just making a blanket statement with nothing to back it up.

I have done in person trades of Bitcoin and also had the beta of local trader (which was somewhat useless as there were like 8 of us in the world).
The key is meeting in a public place. A Barnes &amp; Noble. A Burger King. Somewhere where there is people. You aren't doing anything illegal so you shouldn't feel like it's a shady act. You can do it in a mall food court if you want. 
Just do it somewhere you feel safe. If you're still worried, stick with the exchanges. Mycelium by design doesn't want to be in the escrow business (they don't store your private keys or any of your money) so I don't foresee them adding this to their system. The goal of this service is Cash for Bitcoin. That's always going to involve meeting someone in person. 
There is the high possibility that store owners will get in on this too though. That might quell your nervousness.

I'm all about skepticism, but this is just hyperbole. The implications of a backdoor in BitLocker across ALL releases would have major implications to Microsoft both financially and legally.
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:57:20
I'm a beta tester for Mycelium and love it. Unfortunately though, it doesn't have a widget. There are plenty of in-app ways to do this but I'm looking for something real time that's always in sight. I have pretty much all of the data there. All I'm missing is something to do the multiplication in real-time as it changes.

How close? I'm in Maryland and I haven't seen a fee that low. What's your username?
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:24:17
I'm letting it load up my info now. It looks promising! Is there an extension associated with it?
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:01:49
Another great way to spend Cold Storage is with Mycelium (for Android). It has a specific Cold Storage spending feature. You scan your private key, give it a destination address, and put in the amount. After you send it, the key is wiped from memory (it never touches disk) and can't be used again without rescanning the private key.
For security sake, it's probably best to do this as a one time thing, but it's intended to be a way to safely spend from a cold wallet multiple times while maintaining security.
I personally have a wallet I like to call a "warm" wallet. I keep more in it than a hot wallet but it's not the amount I keep in an untouched cold wallet. I use it as a means to require me to actually go home and "get money out of the safe" to send a higher amount of coins instead of just having the keys available on my phone or computer. I try to keep less than $200 worth of BTC actually on me.

DEAR GOD. 
PLEASE GO CHANGE YOUR BLOCKCHAIN.INFO PASSWORD TO SOMETHING LONGER! 
And turn on 2FA.
I won't go into details here, but there is enough information in your video to get back to the ability to give a run at that password.
Also, the gift code is visible in the video. I can PM it to you if you don't believe me.
Jeeze la weeze. Please just go secure everything involved in making this video.

I'd love to hear Dave Chappelle's opinion on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-12 03:09:50
Yes. It's just like any other investment portfolio. Knowing the value of your assets at a glance is extremely important.
There are tons of apps who do all of these things individually. In fact, here's a screenshot of [an example of something I have in chrome right now]( The left is the current BTC value and the right is the amount of BTC in the wallets it's looking at. It's silly that there are extensions from the same devs that output these but all I really want is something that multiplies these two numbers together.
There are lots of things online we don't NEED. It's for convenience. I'd like to see how much real assets I have in a glance that I can watch go up and down with a market as volatile the BTC market is.

Lets say I hacked into one of your systems. If I went into the account and adjusted a cash amount by, lets say, +$0.02, what would happen? Would that $0.02 disappear from somewhere else? How long before someone would notice? Would it even be noticeable? If it was, would people even care? How would you fix it way down the line without just adjusting a discrepancy eventually?
Now, with bitcoin... I can't do that. The ledger is the ledger. It's not just my ledger or your ledger..... everyone has the SAME LEDGER. It's not just numbers on a screen..... It's the UNDENIABLE AMOUNT. It's not changeable. Somebody like the fed can't just come along and say "today there are 2M more bitcoin in circulation" either. What's in circulation is all that's there. The bitcoins that are mined are predictable and will arrive pretty much as scheduled. Nothing can change that.
So it's not a different protocol because there is no CASH "protocol". If you hacked into my bank and added $60 to my account, I could spend it for a long time before someone would notice (unless the hacking itself was caught). You can't do that with bitcoin.
Cash to you is numbers on a screen but it's not some monetary protocol that says when you drop a number on one part of your screen, it 100% without a doubt no matter what will add somewhere else. There is just code written to associate those numbers with dollars, but its all made up and it's not something just anyone can write to be compatible with.
If you have $500 in your bank account right now, I couldn't write an application on my desktop right now to receive $100 of that from you leaving you with $400. If it were 500BTC, I could actually do that. There is no way anything your saying can hold up to that.

I had an issue with them about a week ago and they got back to me in a few hours. :-/ It was about two-factor authentication as well.

It's not places I want to monitor....  I want a widget that I can feed public addresses, it totals them up to a total BTC amount, and then shows me that amount with the current value in USD (based in BitStamp).
I have a widget on my phone that shows the current price, and a separate widget that tells me how much BTC I have. It would be trivial for the latter app to make the api call to BitStamp and add the totals together to get the USD value. It just doesn't exist anywhere.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:43:07
I already have the app but didn't get an update. Did you increment the version so Google Play knows to re-install it?
I even just uninstalled and re-installed and there still isn't a widget. Am I looking in the wrong place?

I'm just curious how you would propose that they would have stopped the Boston bombers.
The Boston bombers were US citizens who planned everything inside the US. You can't possibly knock the government for not being able to stop a completely homegrown terrorist plot and then lambast them for "spying on Americans".
Are you implying that it would be ok for them to spy on Americans if they could have done something like stop the Boston bombers? Or are you saying they suck at spying on Americans?
There is a huge logical fallacy when someone complains about civil liberty violations and complains about the government not being able the Boston bombings in the same argument.

What? I don't think you get what I'm saying or are confused with what you're saying. The value of a single BTC is not based on the number held... it's based on what it's being traded for at any given time.
Addresses hold amounts of Bitcoins. I have coins in several addresses. I have apps that I can input public addresses into and it will output how many coins are in all of them. I also have apps that can check various exchanges for the current trading value of Bitcoin. I'm asking for an application that I can feed arbitrary public addresses (mine or anyone elses), it will total the amount of Bitcoin held in them (lets call that value ***x***), find out the current trading value from an arbitrary exchange (lets call that ***y***), and then do ***x***x***y***=***output***.
