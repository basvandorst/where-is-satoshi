then if you've done that, you are not seeing clear in the chaos.
you've helped by a very tiny little part in the problem which already is in motion. Arriving finally to the 55 million BTC in debt example mentioned earlier.
in side event: Wow that is big interest you got from frient of your's 20% per month!

you see!.. if the government ( central bank) stops printing new papers (money). in few trading / salaries payments cycles  what happens is the big corporations got all the money in circulation as profits then government has no money to pay it's employees neither her army. and voila! you get a civil war.
this was happening in europe before central banks were created, and now it is still happening in some african countries.

Have you forgotten that the idea of BTC is to achieving almost free transactions fees, so no central bank no lending no inflation arriving finally to no government at all !

" 55 million BTC in debt "!!
you have an ERROR in your sequence 
if all the 21 million BTC were all borrowed, you can't borrow anymore until you get some part of them back, waiting for other portions+ interest, you can start borrowing from that part that you've just got and wit for it's return + interest
OH MY GOD!!!
You can't borrow BTC with interest, and you can't borrow with interest without inflation
Thank you very much for the free economics course yao Professor.

it is not fair loan proposal
if you lend at the moment of price was 7000, then that amount was worth 3.5USD at that moment, after one month considering price volatility, it could go to 17k, then loan of 3.5USD worth + it's interest expected to be returned 10.2USD equivalent of btc. that is capital + 191%

That transaction will stay there in the block-chain, &amp; in a few years from now you can look at it when BTC worth £ one million, you says damn it!, I've eaten a dish worth £ 3 689.89 lol
