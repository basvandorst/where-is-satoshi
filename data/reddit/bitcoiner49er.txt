* 1:Install bitcoin-qt
* 2: Rename wallet.dat created by bitcoin-qt
* 3: Copy "found" wallet.dat to same location as renamed file above
* 4: Run bitcoin-qt
* 5: Look for balance
* 6: See if wallet is encrypted
* 7: Yes = small chance of using BTC ----- No = Your BTC to do what you wish with

That's why you buy ---&gt; Transfer to your private wallet.
Or transfer to CB wallet ----&gt; Sell.

What I read:
"We hope to have bought enough BTC at low prices to avoid having to default for our stupidity by Thursday. Thank you for allowing us to lower the price of BTC worldwide. We love our sheeple."

I hate this argument. The physical network (computers, miners, nodes) has a value. It's not based on speculation. Is the price of bitcoin higher/lower than the value of the network? That's for you to decide.

Inexperienced miners may think that they will mine moar BTC at CEX/Ghash because of the number of blocks found.

Been with Slush since 2011. Rock. Solid.

Does anyone see the beauty of bitcoin now? The network can be trusted. It is ONLY in the cases of jag-offs like Mt. Gox, or SR, or Yufi, or whatever third party you want to name, that things go bad. The greed/incompetence/arrogance of these bad third parties is what hurts bitcoin. It has NOTHING to do with bitcoin itself. The fact is the network hums along honey-badger-like and continues to show it's worth. If users would start putting their faith in the math/code instead of Mt. Latte or whatever exchange flavor of the month, there would be stability.
But it's growing pains and necessary for growth and the re-distribution of coins. Just consider bitcoin more than what third party hacks make it.

It won't cost them anything. Just moving a percentage of their mining equipment to an "unknown" pool keeps their incoming BTC flowing. It's not like they are turning their miners off.  
If you truly own 51% then it does not make sense to attack the network. You get more income than an attack would bring.

If you order from BFL or BFLL you deserve to lose your investment. Not really, well yeah pretty much.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:24:09
No it hasn't. Running with funds you "control" is not hax0r.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:30:59
No they didn't.

The "owner" of SR 2.0 took off with them.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:59:37
I didn't say they were still contributing to their "attack". All I said was that if they move a % to unknown they still are mining and receiving proportionate BTC income. So if you have 20% of your mining on pool A, 50% on pool B, 20% on pool X and 10% on pool unknown, you are still receiving the same amount of BTC versus 100% on pool A.
(Yes there may be some variance, but read this:

Coinbase is an easy entry to get BTC. You can then send BTC to any exchange (CampBX, BTC-e, Kraken, etc) and trade for USD which will stay in your account. (Or alt-currency)
Just remember that any exchange is a 3rd party and your funds are subject to their security and integrity.

They only have 51% because miners CHOOSE to use them. Here's a little secret ... the law of averages favors no one. It doesn't matter what pool you are a part of, you will receive mining proceeds according to your hashrate. Obviously having a minimum pool hashrate helps with consistency. I've been with Slush for 4 years now and I have no problems.
Make the choice to support the network and not just your wallet. Very simple. Ghash most likely does not OWN enough miners to keep 51% by itself.

You can create receive addresses to help you keep track of where/who BTC came from. Or to keep your anonymity; sort of...

It's Tiger Direct selling through Walmart. Old news.

Will ebay then refund, unlock and apologize to all the bitcoin auctions it's closed?

Great site! Everything was smooth and easy. Thanks GC Zen!!

Saw your shop last week in the French Quarter. Kudos bro!
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:32:25
So where do you think this continued 20% increase is coming from?
@_date: 2013-08-07 15:23:30
We recently went from 187,281,159 MH/s to 223,746,040 the past difficulty increase from 26M to 31M .That is a 36,464,881 MH/s increase.
Which means if you spread that equally among the 3 ASIC producers, ASICminer, Avalon and BFL; they would need to sell 36,139 USB erupters (blades are not shipping currently); 240 Avalon units (40,476 chips) AND 1500 Jalas (13,036 chips) to make that 20%.
Do any of those number jive with what seems to be reported as sold? No. MAYBE Avalon Batch 3, but that does not account for 20% increases the past 6 out of 7 adjustments.
ASICminer does make their own mining equipment, so they could be adding to their pool; but these numbers are still higher than what is publicly being reported. Someone, somewhere is adding hash power.
@_date: 2013-08-08 13:34:22
Yeah I read that back in June when it was posted. The problem is, this 20% increase is happening EVERY 10-14 days. So if BFL is contributing ONLY 33.3%, that means 1500 Jallys, or 300 25GH rigs, or 150 50GH rigs or 15 Mini-rigs (500GH) every 10-14 days?! Not happening, at least not to customers. PLUS, that means Avalon is shipping ~170 units EVERY 10-14 days; AND ASICminer is shipping 36K USB miners. This is not happening. Yes there is product being shipping, but not regularly enough to account for the increases. All the delays IMHO, are due to companies building their own mining farms. Why wouldn't you?

I'd buy them for .02BTC per
