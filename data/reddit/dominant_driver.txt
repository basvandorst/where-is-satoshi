Other way around.  AC is more dangerous than DC.

Probably paid for by Edison / General Electric.  In the early years of the battle between AC and DC, DC proponent Edison attempted to vilify AC by stressing the point that his DC wouldn't kill someone, but Westinghouse's AC would.  He even went so far as to stage demonstrations using AC to kill small animals, IIRC.

If he's not a specialist in trading/crypto etc., then he should not have been named trustee for this.  THAT is my point.  Personal gain has no bearing here.  It's his JOB to get the most value for those who put him in the trustee position.  That's what he's paid to do, and he did not earn his salary.  He needs to be fired.

I'm pretty sure he just placed the equivalent of a market sell order for the entire block.  If he did, then that's not in the best interest of those who he is serving as trustee for, and he should be held accountable and / or removed as trustee.

do tell?

Yes, when you're selling a large amount of something and you want to get the max value for it, you need to sell it slowly.  If you don't, then you flood the market.  All the buyers become satisfied, and the price drops like a rock.
Bitcoin isn't a perishable commodity, so there's no harm in selling it slowly.

Apparently that alleged strategy didn't work out well for him?
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:44:03
Yes, but the trustee should have sold them at max value.  Which means not driving the price down by flooding the market.  Dumping them all at once like he did was fiscally irresponsible.

It's not a matter of convincing people.  It's a matter of supply and demand.  If there are 5 people who want to buy something for $500, but there are 300 more offering $300 for it, then you can only sell 5 at $500.  If you stand up and say you have 1000 for sale to the highest bidder, then you're going to sell 5 for $500, then 300 for $300 each, then the rest will go for whatever less people are willing to buy for.
But, if you say that you have 1000 for sale at $500 each, then it will take a bit longer to sell them all - but you WILL eventually sell them all at $500 each.

They didn't all sell instantly for the price at the time he clicked sell.
