I am sorry, but I have a very limited traffic atm, so I couldn't read it.
Could someone tell what he is talking about? Bitcoing growth or dollar fall? /s

Why do you think it is impossible to makebthis huge city 400% larger in short term? Isn't it just a question of amount of money to invest? Same thing is going on right now with BTC.

The way you put Bcash supporters in one line with rapists and murderers making me laugh.
Truly believe they are not that bad.

Probably you are thinking about wrong financial freedom. BTC community standing for avoiding banks, not for Lambos.

Yeah, but worse than M2 bank, right?

Heh, USD and EUR are fine way to avoid hryvna inflation as well ;)
Now I am buying some small portions from time to time. Also using my GTX 1080ti for selling hashpower which is enough to cover apartments electricity cost.
My tough bitcoin education started on May 2017, when Coinbase blocked withdrawals. On the same day I've downloaded Core client and started synchronisation.

Strange, but not so long ago I've made a transaction (bitcoin core client) with "Enable Replace-By-Fee" checkbox checked.
Few hours later I've decided to increase the fee, but when I've tried to do it (via right click on transaction and choosing "Increase transction fee") I was returned with error stating something about it is impossible to do it with the transaction with only \_one output\_. Maybe I get it wrong?
edit: I've digged some information on the web and found the YouTube vid (in russian) where ti is told that RBF work only if there is an output with the "change" from your address and balance of this spare change output is going to be used to increase fee.

Вut there is one small edit to your message. Replace by fee is available only if there is a change address in transaction where from the fee can be adjusted. 
In case if you decided to clear some of your addresses and paid transaction fee from the amount (cleared the addresses completely by amount+fee) you won't be able to increase the fee, because it can be increased only from change address, which is absent.

"I am in crypto since very beginning"
Holding 1200 BTC on exchange
Give us another crypto pioneer, this one is broken.

Yesterday I accidentally found this address 
I am really wondering is it a person, or exchange
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:11:19
It is and it is the reason of 2nd layer solutions. Yes, the fee will high, but 20$ for sending 50000 is cheaper than bank transfers.
Regarding the lower fees:
Few days ago I saw fees comparison in r/btc, where it was stated that bch fee is 0.002$ per transaction and btc is over 3$. It was during the time when btc mempool was cleared and even 1 sat/byte transactions went thru. So I've asked if the btc fee will be 20 times bigger because of the initial coin price (8k vs 0,4k) and got some downvotes and no answer.
I am not about promoting or FUDing on any crypto. If it has it's use case - I am all in for more people to get more into crypto.
