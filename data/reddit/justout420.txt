How will these instructions differ for the main net? Also, how much BTC will I need to load in order for it to help the network.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:00
Exactly this. Waiting it out to see how high bch gets before I can trade it for BTC at a low. Perfect combination.

Or three days like my cheap ass had to wait last week.

Exactly this. Value is subjective.

Once lightning is active for Bitcoin will this be the app to run?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:29:28
Well technically it hit 19.6k already. If only for a moment.

Fees: 0.99 BTC

Is this the place to to now? I really like the simplicity of coinbase but I'm taking my business elsewhere.

I'm definitely the Bitcoin guy as well. However, I teach high school students and have had a lot of students asking me about Bitcoin. I simply hand them a copy of the white paper and tell them to read it. There's no way I'm giving financial advise to one of my students.

I've always felt that TL;DR should be TL;WR (too long; won't read) and placed at the beginning.
Mostly because I almost always read the while thing and then find there's a great synopsis that explains everything at the bottom.

How can I set up a full lightning network node?

Are you still waiting? I've been waiting since the 20th.

That's the point. They buy low and the "free coins on our new chain" fever hits. Then the price rises as the fork is approached. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:11:03
My thoughts exactly. I thought that the value of BCH and BTC combined would be approximately the value of BTC coming into the fork. But right now we're coming up on +3000$ for the combined rates. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:07:37
And now it's taken. Good job.

Kraken has a fixed 0.001 BTC fee. 10$ to withdraw to a wallet. I've got a little BCH I've been looking to offload but I'm not sure the cheapest method to do so.

Ordered one last week. Arrived at my house but had to have  my mother-in-law pick it up for me. Haven't had a chance to activate it or use it yet. Look forward to trying it. My only concern is whether or not bitpay is a nice and safe place to keep my coins when August 1st rolls around.
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:56:24
Gotcha. I was wondering though if the actual bitpay wallet would be a good place to hold my coins with bitpay not supporting BIP148. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:51:22
If I can extract my keys, can you point me to a how to for how to use those keys with another wallet? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:28:18
After I import the private keys, what happens to my old wallet, the addresses, the wallet itself, and any funds that are in it? Will everything associated transfer to the new wallet?

Does the Android Bitpay app count as my own custody? I currently have about 50 USD in my bitpay wallet and would like to know if I need to switch wallets. I started with bitpay because of the option of the bitpay visa and being able to seamlessly get cash from btc and spend it anywhere. 
Edit: bitpay says that my private keys are stored locally on my device and not in the cloud. Does that mean I am ok?
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:46:01
You have to load the bitpay visa. It's not a convert as you charge card.
