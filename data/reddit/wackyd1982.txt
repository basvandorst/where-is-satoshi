It is different - with dash you keep your coins in your wallet and the mixing process is decentralised and trustless. The mycelium tumbler is none of these things - your coins are sent (requires trust) to a server (centralised) run by mycelium. So very different.
@_date: 2016-08-21 11:05:20
right - so what you're saying is that you dont trust something because you dont understand it? I agree, total anonymity can be scary considering who might take an interest in those wanting this. Anyway, a lot of smart people are involved in dash, and all it aims to do is be a digital replication of cash - anonymous, instant, fungible.. look into it :)

“[W]e agreed that the state should control the process of cryptocurrency emission and its circulation. The state should take control over it,” Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said at the time. “I won’t speak about specific parameters now but in general we agreed that the state should take a lead in this process and to regulate it on the legislative level.”

It doesn't matter what people have made already. That in no way negates bitcoin's intrinsic potential. Its value now will seem small in 5 more years' time.

Bitcoin is a game changer.. Something man has never experienced.. In a few years, the app and hardware ecosystems will bring it to the point where you don't need to understand how it'll work.. It'll be integrated into every day life without you needing to understand the technicalities.. 
It will succeed..

What? How does this relate to the article. What it's saying is that if a theft is due to the end users sloppy security practices, then they won't be covered. And rightly so. What the insurance covers is the event that EVERYONES coins are lost by the service due to a breach of their security practices 
@_date: 2014-01-12 04:57:47

All it shows is the trades that are being made, not an actual "leak" of fiat.. Fiat is just used for the transaction. So it is useful in the sense that it is a visual representation of the trades occurring in real time

Deflation is not really an issue as long as there is at least SOME volatility to the price. There are so many other variables that can affect the price, so the impact of a deflationary element won't have that much a substantial affect on price in the short to medium term.. Maybe only the long term?

This is revolting. The CEO, every board member and all senior management should have been incarcerated and their lives put through the resulting shredder.

A 'fund' is the money invested by a group of investors who then pay fees for someone to manage their money. Buying bitcoin yourself cuts out this manager middleman, but you would have to store / keep your bitcoins safe by yourself.

in the long term, looking at the big picture, what bitcoin is worth now is nowhere near what it'll be in 4 or 5 years. any volatility now will be meaningless later on (you'll look back at it thinking it petty)

Because it's your loss if you don't
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:48:26
because you can use all that money you waste in litecoin miners on actual bitcoin. And if you do the maths, anything you are actually able to mine and convert to bitcoin, will net you much less than using all that capital to invest in bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-12-28 06:05:57
It doesn't mean a billion came in. It just means demand outstripped supply in such a way that the cost of acquiring bitcoin increased, increasing bitcoin's price. The increased price multiplied by coins in existence is then valued at $15 billion.  Who knows how much new money actually came into the system to do this, but it's not 1 billion

"Melamed, 85, said while he was initially skeptical about bitcoin he sees similarities between it and International Monetary Market currency futures trading, which he launched as chairman of the Chicago exchange in 1972.
“The world in the 1970s didn’t look at currency trading as a valid instrument of finance. I too went from not believing (in bitcoin) to wanting to know more,” he said.
He says bitcoin could go beyond being a crypto-currency and represent a new asset class based on blockchain technology."

@_date: 2015-04-01 09:29:38
Yep I use the app. Coinjar released a debit card recently. Potentially they could copy the tap and pay function to work with their android app and you could spend bitcoin that way.

it's a hell of a skull he has.. at least 70% brain by volume, to my calculation.. facial skeleton makes up a disproportionately small part of his skull as well - less talk, more thinking is the ultimate outcome

how so? im curious now.. Like just a day-to-day bitch to deal with?

Agreed. Lenovo make great computers on a hardware level and I never buy any other brand. What I do do when I get a new machine is buy and OEM copy of windows and install it fresh onto the machine. Virgin and clean with zero bloatware.

Err.. I'm not a lawyer, but I know it takes a shit load of hard work to become a good one. And they get compensated for all that opportunity cost.. Yes, bring on the downvotes, but working as another type of professional that puts in long hours, remuneration sometimes fairly represents what should be expected

coming on this forum and asking that question is akin to walking into a church and asking the priest if he should accept Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour

I added to the total in that account. I was so paranoid about BIP38 I wanted to make sure it couldn't be cracked. I still don't trust my address with a 32 character password. Irrational fear

did you know that the entire bitcoin network (mining) consumes as much power as only one Airbus A380 flying at cruise speed?
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:24:13
what's the big issue? they have provided an outstanding service for so long, for free, why shouldnt they be allowed to monetise it a bit? just ignore the ads, it's no big deal. everyone wants everything for free, they feel they are entitled to it. it's a great wallet and we should support it
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:39:50
If they are, I doubt they are consuming the entire output of the plant

CoinJar are good, I have had no issues with them. They are getting SWAMPED recently though with recent cypto uptake explosion - friends were having difficulty signing up, getting verified and also contacting support. Be patient, otherwise go and use another service

@_date: 2017-06-08 03:38:07
Nope dont use coinbase, you're going to have a bad time if you do. Coinjar has worked for me 100% of the time, but they are getting flogged at the moment with bitcoins meteoric uptake recently.. And they are a bit limiting as to how much you can buy per day ($2500 by BPay and $2500 via bank transfer even AFTER you are fully verified)
