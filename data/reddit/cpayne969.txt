Paxful is a platform you can buy and sell bitcoin for various stuff with monetary value at a profit. There are various similar platform you can search for, tho paxful is the most reliable, based on what people say here in reddit and other forums and review sites.
You really can't say that Paxful itself is a scam or other platforms are scams, but there could be people in the platform which will take advantage of others, just like any other existing platform. Some platforms implement measures to minimize the risk of being scammed, such as verification through government ID's, although none has been deemed effective while some actually created a more riskier environment. So it really is up to the people using the platform to conduct their own risk mitigation strategies.
As to the rich guy in instagram, just say thanks for introducing you to the platform and stay away from him. hahaha

If you do not want the idea of travelling to other countries which will allow you to exchange your cryptocurrency to their currency, you can try selling your bitcoins to P2P trading platforms like PAXFUL (I do not trust localbitcoins) You can trade and earn profit as well. Although as paxful is just a trading platform, you will not be trading with Paxful the company itself. You will transacting with other paxful users, so there is a need for you to be a little more careful with choosing who to transact with. If in case you get scammed or something bad happened during your transaction, their customer support is reliable and will help you as much as they can help you.

Oooh .. so it's more of a trust and security issues with the company collecting the data?

Paxful is as safe as it can be. Any platforms are the same. The difference tho is how they treat their users. Scammers hate paxful. The support team are so reliable that scammers are having a hard time winning disputes and just transfer to other platforms. In short, their support team is the most reliable support team in all P2P trading platforms for bitcoins.

It sounds funny .. but yeah, that really is how you value bitcoin without fiat. 1BTC = ???ETH or 1BTC = ??DOGE and so on.
The question tho is how to encourage people to use Bitcoin and let it circulate, instead of being held up on wallets. hehehe.

To be fair, there are also lots of tutorials in the internet for other trading platforms. Although, those uploading paxful tutorials are more reliable compared to those uploading for others like lbc or bisq.
