Sorry, but you are just wrong and don't know what you're talking about. If you change one particle's state in an entangled pair, the other's state does not change.
Literally the first paragraph on that page says


So one zany professor wants to do an experiment. In his own slides he admits it "has a low probability of success".
The assertion that "we do not know everything yet" is a pathetic misdirection. It is true that we do not know everything yet. That does not mean that anything is possible.

It specifically says that you need a subluminal classical channel. I.E., slower than light.

Are you serious? The entire *country* used to get its phone service through the Ma Bell monopoly.

In the direction of time?

Look dude, even the bitcoin company says there is no way to make it completely anonymous. If you hopped between mixing services you make it much harder to trace. But at some point you have to put money in and someone has to take money out. If they can link enough of the chain to put everything together they can catch you. If you feel safe using mixers then go ahead, but you are never going to be 100% safe from being caught and you are committing a felony if you don't report your taxes. And it could be that they can't link you right now, but if they take a look at all of that internet data in their NSA facility 20 years from now and can link you, they could come for you then, since there's no statute of limitations for tax fraud.

Well the bitcoin wiki says it's capital gains. Plus, if you invest in a hard currency, the gains are capital gains.
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:49:28
Absolutely. Any profit you make is taxed as capital gains. The specific term used is [Forex]( which is short for foreign exchange.

IIRC your first 8500 (or is it 11500?) dollars of total income is untaxed, so if you made less than this in total you will not be taxed. However, you still need to declare it as income.

They still CAN link you. It's more difficult though. If they wanted to find you they could by getting the logs from the mixing service. Or, if you put in a weird quantity of coins that identifies you (e.g., add 123.5 coins to the mixing service and a few minutes later, the mixing service sends 123.5 coins to a new address).

You're never completely safe. For example, if the government is watching IP traffic from the mixer, they can still catch you. Even if you are using something like TOR. Mixers only make it harder to catch you, do not believe for a second that bitcoin is completely anonymous. It is not.

As faknodolan said, it is definitely taxable, but you can write off hardware as business expenses.

This is true, the same is true for owning a stock.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:45:57
You are still committing tax fraud though. If they ever find out, you are in trouble...
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:42:40
They ARE traceable. There is a global transaction register and while it might take some detective work, your bitcoins CAN be tracked back to you.
