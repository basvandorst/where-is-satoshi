Around there. It's been down the entire time I've been invested. But I don't understand all the panic on this sub. If you invested only what you're willing to lose, what's the problem?
I'll admit I initially invested for a quick pump and dump, but now I believe in the technology and I don't want to sell period. 
On a lighter note, I've almost doubled my investment in ETH.

How much was it for?

Freezing crypto transactions, not freezing accounts. Also, in Australia only. What a title..

Well I did say "if they do it right" and it sounds like your family didn't

All memes aside, everyone with a 401k is making money in their sleep, and if they do it right, will retire at 62/65, which in current year, is a long ways away from dying.

Aren't you allowed a 1-time loan from your 401k that's penalty free? my 401k company offers this.  You have to pay it back, though.

I personally am happy to be a part of this little piece of history. If bitcoin goes down to $0 I'm along for the ride and was happy to be there for it's rise and fall. 
I'm a part of something great, I think that's a good reason.

Yes. Bought Dec 19th with my bank account that I linked that same day. Told me it would take up to 5 days. It's still pending. 
Considering it's only been 4-5 business days for me, I'm not too worried. 
I heard Coinbase customer support is impossible to reach right now, because they're so inundated. So waiting a bit more is all we can do anyway.

FYI my bank transfer on coinbase took 9 days
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:34:10
Yeah I'm definitely moving off coinbase once my shit is settled
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:21:13
Still waiting on a tx from 12/19

Does anyone else see the irony here?

Uber being more convenient =/= "works better"
Taxiing is a unionized job of trained and licensed individuals who are experts at navigation and traffic law. 
Uber is a business modeled around people duped into making $5 an hour, who spend half their time with their eyes off the road staring at their GPS, and who also have forgotten 95% of what they learned when they got their license at 16. 
Out here in LA uber drivers are the fucking worst, because they all commute here from other areas and have no idea where they're going. Stuck behind someone going 25? Or perhaps you just got cut off by someone about to miss a turn? Always, that fucking Uber sticker, every time..

Either $5 million, $50k, or $0. i can guarantee this after many researching.

My Coinbase transfer took 9 days. 
The intelligent thing to do is not use coinbase.
