I find that a majority of reddit is a circlejerk so I pretty much give up on ever putting up criticism even if I am trying to have an honest conversation and not just troll. I mean, this guy might be well meaning (I looked at his history and where as I might not approve of his personality, I could see it adding up one way or the other), but he even posted something like "hey guys, now I'm up to 6 dollars." Like what's the point continuing to tip someone for very little content? 
I don't know, but it's their money to tip.
Still, if people want to evangelize, why not save that to tip other new people?
Still, that's part of the issue with any sort of democratic voting is group thinking. A LOT of people will vote based on how others are, and so it skews voting, even if for the better. Meh.

There is no defined "mining period" since transaction fees are given to the miners.
If those fees aren't enough and no one mines, then transactions don't get verified. However if a lot of people stop because the fees are too low, then the people left get to make more coin for their hashing power, so it might become profitable again. Big guys come back, lose profit, rinse and repeat.

The general rule is that you need to pay the fee, but someone might be mining without that as a parameter and confirm it anyway... or something like that.

Depends on the hobbyist. Somewhat hard to relate, but I dropped a like 3 grand between a pc game and a physical game within a year. Those are obviously hobbies. I don't have that kind of income anymore, but I have done over 500 in mining in the past year, mostly on used stuff. Some of it pays for itself, but not most of it honestly. Hobby for are reason though I suppose.

Just sayin'. If you can't go through the bank account means, you have to buy from someone. You could try buying from someone some other way, but usually people want cash, or you have to go through a system that requires verification because otherwise you could scam someone too easily.
Then you would have to sell your BTC in a similar way as to how you bought it since you can't connect a bank account, or just spend it like currency. If you want online USD in/out you need to be a reliable source, which usually also means you are of age with a bank account and some sort of financial history etc etc.
It makes complete sense really.

Not only America, it's just the point I was making since it was Americans harping on someone from a different part of the world and how chargebacks were so important, and the other person didn't think so.
It's just, a reality here. It's like supermarkets. They exist everywhere, but we go overboard with them in America. Some of the more "laid back" European countries find them odd because they are used to going to get their groceries just about daily. I go shopping for groceries like 2-3 times a month. Just different mentalities from different social norms. I do like that in America I am allowed to be a lot more antisocial and no one really cares. I don't know most of my neighbors and honestly I don't really care. There might be times when it would be nice to know them, but I like not having to make small talk every time someone walks by my house. So it's all give and take.
I will say, I find it really freaky that we might be having a relatively civilized conversation on Reddit of all places. I guess stranger things have happened.

Just as a little tangent, I bank online as well. I can call up the bank and request a large withdraw and then go to a brick and mortar bank (of which is not my own) and they can withdraw it from my account like an ATM.
Not as convenient as BTC, but if you need to do it, it can usually be done.
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:05:28
You seem to not understand that here in America the customer is always right, so they take that to the internet and get mad when other people don't have the same thought process. Here we would rather scam each other, so we don't understand places where people are generally humane.

It's young... I mean, even established currencies fluctuate, we just don't get to see it unless you do a lot of converting. A young currency has to find its place.
The reality is all currencies are pretty fucked, but there's not much to do about it. It is a real currency, just not one that is great for spending right now.

I had an account friend who is generally pretty smart who asked me how much I had in Bitcoin. I said "about .3 bitcoin" and he chuckled and said "And you can't use it until you have one whole one." 
I gave him a funny look and said "No, I can use it. It's divisible up to 8 decimal places." And he sort of looked ashamed and said "Oh."
Even smartish people still don't understand bitconi.

Challenge and to be upset about it are different. Still, where are they going to ramp up all this production quick enough to not be noticed? I feel like they would, well before that, just work with ISPs to disrupt network connections well before spending that much time, money, and efforts into a 51% attack. 
Then again, most governments don't really think about what they are doing and it's effectiveness/efficientness/etc

OK, where as what you say is in the realm of possibility, it sounds much more like a terrible movie than reality. The lawyer wouldn't know it was encrypted until they try it, and they probably wouldn't rob this person and then stand around like "hold on, just want to make sure it works before I leave." furthermore, it would be pretty obvious what went down, so what are they going to do with the BTC in prison? Buy favors while in the computer area? I really don't think a lawyer of all people would really go through with all of this. That's a lot of really slim chance things. There are much better things to be worried about than the lawyer hunting down your next of kin and torturing them for the password.

When my bike was stolen I realized I wouldn't get it back and decided to put up a flyer and post some stuff online, but I was still hyper aware of anything that I thought might help me find it (analyzing bikes i see and such).

As you sort of hinted at, they might if it was tens of millions of dollars worth of legos. They are selling it because it has a market, and they have enough of it to make it worth their time.
If it was 1 BTC, it would remain wherever they had it stored and it would be forgotten about. So I don't think the analogy really gets its point across.

I was being a heavily sarcastic American, so you got it half right. I'm glad you did better than I did at being level headed, though I did delete a few expletives before posting. So kudos to you for being able to be more of an adult than I am (this is not sarcastic, I just think we need to tell people on the internet who aren't being jack asses that they are doing good more often, because all we see are said jack asses, which I know I can be at times).
Here's the thing. Chargebacks are different than reprimandations because someone looks into that reprimand, where as your bank won't really look into a chargeback claim, as long as you don't have them too often. They usually just side with the customer, and it is then "guilty until proven innocent." So the difference is it's a government that is looking for everyone's best intentions (not, like in the US, where it has become a huge money game for the most part), instead of a bank who just wants to keep the customer happy to take more of their money.
Furthermore, those countries don't really have any issues like we do here. It's not really a fair or good comparison. It's like... hmmm... talking about drug addiction here and comparing it to the Netherlands. They don't really have a drug problem so they don't have special police forces to crack down on drug trade violence. It's not "well what are you going to do if some cartel tries to take over the country," because they don't have that issue at all. We look to our neighbors to the south and we see that exact same thing happening, but because of completely different stances on the subject. 
It might be similar to an Iranian wondering how we don't have a government censored internet. We must all be completely immoral and have filthy violent minds... well, they might have an argument there, but not a good one. How about nudity in the US compared to Europe? Sure, they can have nudity out in the public, and some people in the US think "but what about the children?!" when in reality the human body isn't as fetishized over seas, so just seeing a nipple doesn't equate to something sexual.
My TL;DR might be: It's comparing apples and oranges to compare the uses and misuses of our chargeback system in America to the financial situation in another country.

EDIT: Further more, cashiers are generally not paid that much. It's hard to give a fuck. Customers are usually idiotic ass hats. Society has taught them that if you whine a lot you can have whatever you want. They harass the cashier in many ways (sexually, mentally, and sometimes even physically) and they really don't care about the cashier in return. Often times whenever I would see a customer complain about a cashier the manager usually backed them up because it turned out the customer was being a raging dick monger.

That's the plan, just like I stated. They will keep getting the fees, and in theory there should be enough by then to keep miners mining, and if there isn't most jump ship, lowering difficulty, possibly raising profitability to keep miners around. The hash power should settle itself so that miners are happy with profits or not mining.

Sigh. I never claimed a change in definition. I was actually pointing out someone being dumb about irony. I'm just saying that things can be opposite to what is expected and be not at all ironic. Besides, there are at least 3 forms of irony. We are talking about situational irony I guess.
There's literary irony, where we know more than the characters and yet within the story the characters continue on information we know to be false.
And then there is one kind of like sarcasm but different. Where someone says something and yet they mean something very different.
So I am just saying irony is fickle and hard to generalize.

I'm not being racist, I am making fun of the social standard.
I get their point, but they were also adamant that since it happens in America that everyone has the same problem. Having been to, and knowing people in other countries, there are some who are worse off (I hear that the lower class people in China and Taiwan often have issues with getting crap and not being able to do anything about it) but plenty of other countries (like northern Europe, Korea, Japan) the merchant often bends over backwards to keep you happy, and I have never heard of a reason to charge back when someone had something go wrong. Maybe there are reasons, but other countries side with the citizens, not the corporations like the US does (I mean, they are people after all, bigger and richer people than the rest of us people). In those countries they don't need to take it to court, it just gets dealt with by calling the authorities. We need to remember that we might be a global power and a first world country, but we are still pretty back asswards in some respects. 
Also, I live in america. I have the same payment system as him. Attention to details. You are actually being one of those entitled pricks by getting pissed off about a comment on the internet and taking a moral high ground by insulting someone who you believe insulted you.
So, maybe read what you are responding to. It helps. American isn't a race, it's a culture. Also, this is the internet, calm down.

I only had .01 BTC so far, so it was tough to pull the trigger, but I decided I wanted to promote the spending and what not. Furthermore, some of my friends think I am crazy for talking about Bitcoin so much, so now I can show them that you can actually buy stuff with it and what not and have physical proof.
It's strange how it feels so cool to have spent my mining efforts to buy a product. I am just stupid excited about it.

I feel like people just need to remember that tipping should be for actual content. If someone is asking for a tip, but provides nothing, then that needs to be ignored so it doesn't become the norm. 
That does make an issue with reposts though, but that's an evil on every sub, though it could be for worse reasons here. 
I think people need to not tip so much for circle jerk around this sub, and I also agree people should do it on other subs to spread interest. Sure, some people will be jerks, but that's society, and especially the Internet. People are greedy though and will more often accept it, and then probably spam this sub asking how to get fiat for it.

Why are you so butt hurt about people pointing that out?
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:39:21
This whole discussion (not ours, as you were making a tangential observation, so I did the same) isn't about "a year" but about THE year 2014, which is only pertinent in the gregorian calendar, not any calendar.
Arbitrary also has a part of its definition to imply relevance. We chose the year (the time it takes the Earth to revolve around the sun) because we live on Earth. An Earth year is arbitrary in that if we were on a different planet, it would no longer make sense. So it is a standard on Earth, based on a system on Earth, and basing it on Earth is arbitrary because it is only relevant if you are comparing time to Earth. It's a great standard, and I use a Gregorian calendar  because everyone around me does. Doesn't make them any less arbitrary.

Well now that we are on the same page, I never meant to imply that the arbitrary nature of measurements defends bitcoin or something. I mean, I realize that this all probably started from one of the many circle jerkers who's like "yeah, but it used to be worth nothing! Look how much it has grown!" (which has some legitimacy, but not enough to really disprove that BTC has popped since becoming "popular").
I was simply saying that "yeah, it's arbitrary, but it's still standard." So I want to extend an olive branch and say sorry that we got heated, but I think there was a misunderstanding. I am not trying to jump to BTC's defense here. Sure, I wish it would make me a millionaire, but not only do I realize that's probably not going to happen, I also realize that simply saying "well over X time it was fine," isn't going to really cause a huge swing by me/SomeGuyOnReddit or anybody that already is seen as sort of a fanatic.
The only real point I care about in this is that even though "2014" is rather arbitrary, it's not like that's a bad thing. My name is arbitrary, but it's mine and it's how I am identified and that's fine by me.
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:22:10
It's sort of funny that you make fun of someone else just knowing about things.

But no, you're right, the things you state without doing any research or knowing about are all correct.

I have a 400gb per month limit on my internet or I start incurring crazy fees. This is on a cable connection in the US. My wife and I already use around 300gb per month streaming TV/Music and everything else. So this quote says to be a real BTC user I would have to spend at least another 50 USD a month to upgrade my service OR just baby a node to make sure it doesn't use more than 100gbs a month?
I mean, I know I am not a hardcore user by any means, but it makes it seem like getting more people to want to use BTC will be rough if there are already people confused by how to buy some and put it in a wallet, etc.
Maybe I need to do more research and see how I can run a limited node.

Yeah. I forgot it all, but ugh... every once in a while you could make it work out for you.. "Well, I am going to drive to see my family who is visiting in that city that is 499.5 miles away, so I don't need to request leave, but I will leave a copy of this form in case my car breaks down and I can't make a random drill you just made up within the allotted time frame."

@_date: 2015-04-25 05:44:39
Sounds legit, and I don't doubt it. 
It was still interesting because there were very few interactions in which we ever used the one fax machine in the entire building. Local flight conditions were done by phone and unsecured internet, yet to fly in at least one of the non-local areas we flew in we needed a faxed report (not sure if it was both or not, as it was a minimum of 6 years ago that I was part of that chain as I have been out of active duty since 2010).
The government isn't great about being financially conservative though, so even in that respect it's not surprising. I often wished that when your desk broke due to some weird circumstance you could just go to ikea and replace it. Instead you had to submit a form to someone who submitted a form to someone who decided if that form was submitted correctly who then put it into a system who decided if the request was justified and then I don't know what happened but BOOM, desk that costs multiple thousands of dollars designed by someone who apparently wasn't human because it was in no way a good desk. So sending faxes was one of the least weird things, just annoying.
Really, I spent most of my time staring at outlook pretending to read emails from people who didn't seem to really understand how email worked so I wasn't asked to do something else instead (well, all that is when I wasn't actually doing the job the government had spent over 100 grand teaching me how to do, so instead they had me vacuum because there wasn't much else for me to be doing and they were paying me either way).
So yeah, there might be some legal/technical/secret reasons that they used fax from that undisclosed place to send us information in another otherwise undisclosed place, but I still chalk it all up to ineptitude of the powers that be, and me being smart enough to point out how stupid I actually am.
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:47:12
The gross thing is that in early 2010 the Air Force unit I was in was still using the fax machine daily. The machine they were using only seemed to successfully send about 75% of the time.

to go further. 250bit is nothing. Changetip doesn't recognize it, so it looks for something it does recognize, and it recognizes pizza as being 10 bucks USD.
so effectively chagetip saw "tip this guy a pizza" which it translates to 10 bucks USD. He meant to say "tip this guy 250 bits," but 250bits isn't an acceptable string. So it scanned for possible tips, and only came up with pizza (or pizza was the lowest tip it found) and went with that.

banning coinbase because they are discussing bip101 and XT takes away from the narrative of core vs XT. 
The fact that XT is an adaptation to bitcoin makes the topic relate to bitcoin in that it can show the benefits of derivative coin. It's not like most other coins in that it is a blockchain but completely different. It is a proposed change to core, so not allowing people to discuss the good and harm it does takes away from the discussion to if the proposed idea was any good.
Instead, you are taking it upon yourself to decide the outcome of discussions here, which is exactly what you are against coinbase doing.
This attitude can be frightening to newcomers who might not search through your history to see if you are an authority in the currency or not. It makes it sound like the BTC world is no better than the big banking world where people push their influence to guide those who don't have the time or ability to research the financial situation themselves.
It doesn't matter what you stand to gain or lose, but you can't promote this as a public forum to discuss bitcoin, and then refuse to allow people to discuss it's position against a proposed change. 
Why not start a or if you're so steadfast on not allowing all things bitcoin (core, XT, or otherwise). This place has been a community for five years, why should it now be a privatized club because someone has proposed change to core, and made an example in XT to show off their proposal?

Nyancoins. Either it was originally a huge joke (which is most likely, based on the 1337 payouts) or started because doge was doing go and someone else wanted to make it big starting their own coin (actually, I remember they worked with the guy who had rights to nyancat, so they probably thought they were going to get rich). 
Whatever the case, I GPU mined some for shits and giggles, and like most p&amp;d it had some value for a bit which I used to buy some ltc or btc at the time, but I still have a bunch for fun. I was subscribed to the sub just to make sure if anything crazy did happen I wouldn't be out of the loop, but it was pretty obviously dead.

If that is the case, people are going to not take any merit in McDonald bucks, unless maybe they need them to buy a burger, but then either MickeyDs will suffer, or just offer to exchange USD/BTC/etc into MDB (McDonald bucks) for you, which then makes them again rather worthless as people will still be using other currencies. 
I think you are skipping some steps into how it works OP.

So for the 12 dollars, I am guessing it is a credit card like plastic with NFC chips on either side? Does the user load in the keys? Is this just like a fancy paper wallet, or is there more going on with the NFC capabilities? 
I am quite interested, but still unsure.

That guy is so awkwardly exciting in such an endearing way. Love it.

Just curious, how certain are you on the 30 day window? I will preorder one as soon as I have the funds (I am broke, but should have some money on Wednesday or so), and I realize that things like this can be delayed (I have dropped over 10k on Kickstarter... I have a problem), so I am just curious how sure you are that it will be ~a month.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:32:39
There are enough scams on here to make most people pretty leery, though some are still curious enough to go in on things despite their better judgement. Just wanted to point out the scary points either for the sake of others, or for you to correct.
Good luck, but 7K USD is quite a bit, but then again you are allowing a place like reddit decide what goes on your body permanently. Any idea where you are thinking about getting said tattoo, if everything goes through?

What I meant to imply was I wish I had bought sooner so my account would let me buy more right now.
@_date: 2013-12-22 09:53:27
I meant "paper wallet" like the thing. I guess offline wallet or something might be better.
Anyway, I am very intrigued. If I could spare the whopping 12 CAD when you release them I would definitely grab one. The more I think about it the more I like it and especially if the price is so low.  I also really like that you guys never touch the keys. I mean, I am sure those other physical wallet makers are doing the right thing, but you just never know.

I wonder if a group getting funding successfully through Kickstarter would make them anymore open to accepting Bitcoin as a payment after Kickstarter. 
(I am sleepy, that made sense I hope)

I am 12 and what is this?
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:05:05
People buying rigs are either A) not doing research B) hoping the value goes to the moon, making it worth it or C) doing so as a hobby.
Right now companies taking preorders are conveniently taking a long time to get their product out. Some people call scam, some people just assume it's high orders, and some people assume it's the manufacturer using their own product to make BTC and then sell the product. Whatever the case is, you are not the first to have this revelation and it is all over reddit and other parts of the internet.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:59:33
Keep us up to date. I love the idea, and I like tinkering around but I don't have all that much know how, so I plan to follow your developments and maybe eventually try to make my own if you give us the how-to.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:50:41
It also adds to hiding the qr code and wording or you could try to shine light between the folded part and read the qr code out the back. All the overlapping "bitcoin" prints conceal it.
But yes, they also make it look nicer. The part you are referring to only has one layer to protect the QR code so it just more dense.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:26:24
It's a bot system where people can deposit bitcoins to give out to other redditors through a third party system. Click the links added to see more, but pretty much he/she just gave you .25 USD worth of BTC (valued at the time of post). Enjoy, spread it around, withdraw it to a bitcoin wallet, do whatever (if you ignore it, they will eventually get their money back).

EDIT: bad.

I tried a debit card and it didn't work... Then I realized I have an Amazon credit card and it worked fine.
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:53:37
So the returned revenue, does that go into the current contract, like all mining with stop 10/15, or does it effectively make new, smaller contracts?
Sorry for bugging you about it. I have just seen these, and they sometimes seem too good to be true and such. Glad to hear your investment seems to have paid off already though.

So you are keeping the tiny condoms and the dildo?

I always want to say something when someone says something like "what happens to bitcoin if the internet suddenly shuts down?" Because I am pretty sure "oh no, my bitcoins" is much less concerning than whatever just took out the whole damn internet.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:01:49
Interesting. So I assume you mean the in game currency will be actual bitcoins? Like you are using bitcoins for microtransactions?
I kind of feel like this is going to potentially increase the amount of people asking about mining, which makes me think that you might consider setting up a pool for the game so that people can mine for your game and get credited smaller amounts than they could normally make, while generating more income from the game (a small percent fee included).
I am no expert, so maybe someone could point out how dumb that idea is, but just a thought.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:36:54
with 2 of them I am currently making ~.0003BTC per day, but the minimum withdraw in my pool is .05. I am at .02 currently which I made in over a month, sometimes using my GPU as well, so I have AT LEAST another 3 months to make it to the minimum payment (probably more with difficulty rising so fast), which currently comes out to under 40 dollars. Luckily I paid 30 for each of them, so I have only lost 20 dollars at that point (my utilities are included in my rent, thankfully).
If I am really lucky, the price per erupter will stay at what it is after I decide to stop mining and I can make at least my money back on the erupters if not more and then be able to withdraw my BTC from my pool.
Now, with my GPU I have mined .8 litecoins and 16k dogecoins in weeks, which add up to 30 dollars. I have also used pools that all mine alt coins and give you BTC back and I am already up to .03 BTC doing that for a few weeks as well.
My advice is follow nikitos advice and mine alt coins. Much more fun since you will get more as well.

I am pretty sure this is noob to the noob degree. Congrats on being the only one who knew about Bitcoins though.

"If I have enough submissions" with no explanation of enough. Sounds sketch. 
Maybe add a minimum and promise to return coins if you don't get there instead of having a cheap way out?

and some states allow people under the age of 21 to drink, like Wisconsin, where a parent can let their kids drink as long as they are with them.

Odd hostility there. I just point out that the price point is pretty high for something not too new. My paper wallet is waterproof and durable, it just took a few other extra steps. Woe is me I guess for being somewhat of a DIYer in a community for a decentralized currency.
Oh, never mind. Going to  I see that you are the one selling these. Just because I don't want to buy them doesn't mean I am saying anything negative about you.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:02:28
No, I can't buy right now because that is my first purchase.

I am pretty sure my knowledge of bitcoins is "basic," but I also have an English/Creative Writing Bachelors, if that means anything.

Had to repost, since someone politely pointed out the last time I posted it I had some extra info in there I didn't want.

I said the same thing as you... you just worded it better.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:17:32
Maybe I did read it wrong. I read "this is probably too full-service a product for you" to be pretty passive aggressive.
All the same, I wish you luck. Since I missed out on the physical coins being inexpensive I wanted to look into printing tyvek paper wallets but instead just went with some easy off the shelf stuff for now.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:06:17
Can you comment on what you paid for your contract and how long it is (was initially, or whatever)?
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:06:56
Buy, wait, spend. (edit: Potentially) Best bang for your buck. Mining can be a little fun, but maybe do LTC or doge with a decent GPU. Mining isn't really a money maker unless you expect the "too the moon" predictions, but it can be neat to see the progress as your computer chugs along for a coin/dollar here and there. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:54:02
This user has also only been on for 3 days. Makes me uneasy about the whole story.
2 users join reddit on the same day, one scams the other, then the scammed user tells us to tip a third user...
Little sketch, but I am no detective. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:37:15
The program won't do much on its own without parameters. Not sure how it works on a mac exactly, but I am pretty positive it requires that you either run it from some sort of command line to give it parameters, or you make some sort of shortcut or script that will enter them in for you when you run it. You would have to look for something like that (or maybe even some sort of configuration file that would add the parameters to the app when run).
The other thing is you usually need to sign up for pools. Check your email for any sign up confirmations?
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:22:32
No, that makes sense. I was thinking it didn't look like a game that needed microtransactions or anything, but saying that you weren't going to use another currency made me think I was thinking wrong. Apparently I was incorrectly thinking that I was thinking that my thinking was wrong. Still neat.

I was trying to think of a way of making a 3D printed "paper" wallet. Seeing this, I wonder if you make a QR code like that, and slip a paper wallet version inside so you have to break it open to get to the private key (and, obviously, there would be another copy of the public key).

Not counting on it, thanks though. I am just happy I finally bought some. I just would have went nuts and actually bought a real amount even though I am a little broke at the moment.
