His father passed away. You're the reason crypto is potentially no better than the current banking systems.

Aw man, just saw the original post clearly stating that haha sorry been a while :p
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:40:30
I do know what I'm talking about. I'm not accusing you of being a scammer, but everybody should know that one of the first rules in crypto is YOU DON'T BUY AN EXISTING ACCOUNT FROM SOMEONE ELSE. It's bad practice and you shouldn't enable it. Not on Reddit at least. Just like people shouldn't store their private keys online - they deserve to know that this type of practice only makes their safety more compromised, and those like yourself supporting the platform of potentially more scamming and hacking should honestly sit down in the corner and meditate a bit more. Seriously bro, try to mature a little more emotionally your reactions are akin to a thirteen year old.

Lightning Network. Use it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:42:44
Which country are you in? There might be a center where you can go to to sell, or via localbitcoins, or, safest, sign up for an exchange like Coinbase, and sell it on there. Don't share any information with anyone, like 'private keys' or even your wallet's public address - you'll only need theirs to send the Bitcoin and will need to be sure that you receive payment which is why I rather say you do it on an exchange. I know you just want to sell it right now and you don't want advice, it might be worth way more if you give it about a month, or a year, but either way I say you sell it on an exchange. I'm sorry for your loss.

In order to be successful, a store of value needs a secondary purpose, such as serving as a currency. For that, fees need to be lower. It's been a bit of a ghost town, I don't know when we'll see lightning network successfully implemented. As for your proposal, it's a hard sell and I think you'll need to provide more information and motivation for it to be successful. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:57:25


Not what's happening. Mass adoption majority money bleeding into alts.
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:29:28
Screw coinbase! They're ornery on adapting segwit anyways, looks like they want to intentionally keep BTC transaction prices high.

Man that guy needs to go sit in a corner, really master the art of ego distinction and consciousness, meditate for a while, and then come back and talk about money.
This space we're trying to create will be no better than the current banking systems if we praise fools, worship money over core values, and take no personal responsibility. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:48:38
That means you got in around 11, not 20 :) Good on ya, enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:00:27
By your competing for a space on the block, and by bitcoin being an exclusive store of value (only 21 mil. to be mined, less in circulation). For smaller transactions the lightning network will be introduced but until then you could try other currencies like Litecoin. And yes, GDAX will be cheaper too.

So I know it's been a long time since you posted this but wanted to share what I've just discovered, it's a website you can use any Visa/Mastercard credit card to buy BTC with - however, you have to sign up first and upload proof of ID, and in addition to already including their 5% fee on the price listed, your card company will also charge you 5%. Still an option I'm gonna give a go - It's called Coinmama (dot com). Might help you if you have a credit card. 
Peace brother / sister

This sub is for Bitcoin. I recommend you take your post to /BTC where they treat bitcoin cash as Bitcoin - to each his own, but please take your trolling elsewhere.

Can you explain then please? Just trying to figure out if you're a racist idiot or not. Thanks.

Don't buy other people's accounts. Easiest scam in the book. Get off Reddit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:26:25
I'm not falling for Bitcoin judas I'm aware of the exclusivity of competing on the blockchain for transfer of value, the fact that there are only 21 million BTC ever to be mined and that it's to date been unhackable. It still needs a secondary utility for mass adoption. I'm hoping lightning network will make that possible. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:45:07
That’s an existing account whether you write it in caps lock or not. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:15:14
Well, let them eat cake. I'm holding out for at least trying lightning network before I would ever call it 'sinking'.

Ye no more information and motivation for it to be successful...
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:21:46
If this happens there will be so much fewer use for a lot of alts that aren't built to do something outside of that. 
Please LN can we has now???

People there are buying their own Bitcoin instead of supporting the local currency or the government's crypto currency. I don't understand why you are shouting lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:12:06
I hope you don't mind but I'm copying and pasting this comment to anyone complaining about fees and using the Ver rhetoric in the future. Up until this point I myself had wondered about the fees but this explains it in a way I can get behind (while being patient for small transaction solutions). Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:50:56
Like the Whitepaper, but containing news, or like a Paperwallet, but instead of keys it contains news. Hard to explain. Had to have been there. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:37:03
It matters because mainstream media is the greatest proponent of FUD and consequently an enemy to Bitcoin's prosperity. I'm not a fan of exchanges, they're currently filling a gap for people though and the adoption IS organic and very much happening regardless of good or bad press. I'm not sure what else you mean with all these questions you ask.

Redditor for a day...

The best developers in the space are working for and choosing to work for Bitcoin. They're working on fixing these issues. 
If it's going to make you feel safer, sell off for the amount you initially invested, or even a bit more if you want to experience a profit, and hodl the rest - that way you'll not be losing anything no matter what. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:08:17
Exactly. Loads of people in Nigeria using Bitcoin, price went up when Mugabe stepped down, Zimbabweans NEED Bitcoin, Venezuela needs bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:00:27
Also, from a commenter higher up (and I'm resharing because it opened my mind):
"Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a 'fee'."

It declined until the government announced that they're discussing tax regulation at which point people knew it was being taken seriously instead of being suppressed. (FYI until now there are no tax regulations on crypto currency gains in Korea).

I used to say this too but I'm hearing from techies much smarter than me that it might take at least 3 years. That's a long time for alt coins to absorb some bleed :/ 
I'm still here though, but share OP's concern.

Hi dude. South African here. Try Luno? I know Safas can use that one. Not sure if that would be better rates for you. Man, in general we suffer with the exchange rates. My exchange of choice is in person at a center - maybe you should open one : )

It's stored on the Blockchain. You only ever own the keys to it. The safest way to store your keys is 'cold storage' - definitely not on an exchange.

That would be such an undertaking but such an amazing one! So I'm actually in Korea at the moment, I'll link you the center that I use, just to spark your curiosity. For me it's far better to go in to a center using cash than to exchange online, especially in South African Rand. 
You could be the person getting locals into it! At the center I go to they have talks every Saturday, it's a supportive community. Good stuff.
