I believe she was just avoiding the stigma of bitcoin. Use that word, and you'll have people thinking of the price volatility, security breaches losing people tons of money, and drug sales. None of that is inherent to how the blockchain works, its just been the recent history of bitcoin. If you're trying to convince people that bitcoin/blockchain/distributed ledgers are going to be a big thing, you don't want them focusing on recent history, but rather what its capable when fully realized.

So did you give them a tip in bitcoin?

"AB 130 will allow Oxygen and other gasses to be legally breathed by persons in California by repealing a provision of state law that bars the breathing of "anything but the lawful air of the United States.""
Since only air created by the US was allowed, and almost all air comes from overseas (at some point), turns out just about everybody was breaking the law!

Same thing that gives the dollar value: the belief that if you accept that currency, you will be able to turn around and use it to obtain something else. It is that people are willing to use it for that exchange that gives it value.
Now, what a single unit of currency actually evaluates to (in terms of quantity of goods/services) is a bit more complex, and not something I'm really familiar with enough to explain.

In Java at least, no, as Integer is a wrapper for an int and gets passed by reference.

Well, it's like presidential voting in the US. Your vote doesn't matter, it's just signaling how you want the electoral college to vote.

    /** Assign 14 to an Integer **/
    public void assign14(Integer x) {
       x = 14; //14
    }

Well, the code is the relatively easy part. The hard part is defining what an objectively good decision is and how you arrive at it.

Not relative to when the note was written, unless OP is having his wall demolished today, which seems unlikely.
