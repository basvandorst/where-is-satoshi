Do nerds run the world, doofus? No.
It is the bullies, the thugs and the mafia.
I like Blockchain, but this is basically a ploy to get money from someone else’s pocket when bitcoin goes high.
That’s it.
And it’s not any different than stocks, but that’s the thing.
Stock isn’t pretending to be anything else.
If you guys really wanted to create a parallel economy, you’d be focused on adoption percentage, and not moon and all this bullshit.

You are buying a piece of something whose value is determined on verbal agreement or buying price, and whose price can instantly change to any extent.
There is no physical object of value that can be used other than how this system deems its value.
Does this seem similar to you? 
I don’t want to even get into this useless debate with you people who do not believe in the technology, but simply like bitcoin as a commodity that offers great returns quickly.

If this happens, I’d be superhappy.
It’d no longer be used for trading or be ‘HODL’ed.
It’ll be used for transactions, just as it was envisioned.
I would ABSOLUTELY love it if Bitcoin price doesn’t not fluctuate for the next ten years.

Americans do not use the Bank’s phone app to check their balance?

Yes sir. Recession is closer than you’d imagine.
The credit debt is over 4 Trillion USD in U.S alone, the same crappy CDOs are being sold again under a new name, everything is just the same as 2008.
