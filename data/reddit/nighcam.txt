Hopium lol.... You are totally wrong, we are setting up for the next panic attack, 4800 within 3 weeks, mark my words....

For the long run it doesn't matter much that's for sure. If you go long for next coming years then buying on 6k or 4k doesn't really matter. Both are great buys after it's previous 20k top.

And think it of this way as well:
You must be real stupid to make such a big lie in court.
And a trust is a complicated thing especially if one died and need all of the signatures to be able to thouch and move it.
Also he mentioned 1 january 2020, it is the expiry date and at that time he can move the coins without any other signature. Even if he could access the coins now he is not allowed to as it was said in the contract. This simply can all be true.
And why would he lie if the 1 million + bitcoins are not his/theirs anyway? I mean he could never get access to those or win the lawsuit that suddenly he owns a million plus Bitcoins! So no reason to lie.
I very well understand this can all be BS but at least it can be very well be true. 
To consider this as a 0% possibility is just plain stupid, which many of them here do. Although I like your way of thinking more, you at least give it a very small chance, but still I think the chance is way bigger than most think.

you are a tosser

What is your proof.
And if it is a lie, why is Kleiman suing him over 300 Bitcoin? Also a lie? Suing for fun?

Jezus christ man..... he doesn't have direct acces to those private keys! and not allowed to touch it without the rest of the trusts agreeing to it.
Again an answer with no significance.

Calling his bluff, well if that was true they would be lying in court as well, I don't believe that sir. But again that's my opinion, and what you say is nothing more than YOUR opinion.

About a high profile lawsuit? if it was so stupid the lawsuit was already dismissed! And well it isn't, so not that stupid after all!  You must be 10 years old? Come with a better answer next time or just don't respond at all.

You give a 0% possibility for something you can't proof, how idiotic that is!
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:27:57
'Just because it could be, it doesn’t mean the chance is reasonable at all.'
'It’s close enough to zero.'
This is an opinion sir, as with everything about chances people do put different percentages on it. Just because you say so doesn't mean it's close to zero, that's simply your opinion. And yes I think it has a bigger chance than what most people think, that's also an opinion , my opinion.
But you act like you are right on the chance part, that's not true.

Not allowed to act without others in trust...

LOL I hate this about this sub reddit, Bitcoin maximalists who don't come with a good answer, just pure BS.
@_date: 2019-09-02 23:34:05


It's a simple fact sir, it is your opinion and that's all. You don't have facts or evidence enough, it is simply your opinion.
And now you are saying that my opinion is not equally as valid as yours without presenting valid evidence? lol are you serious? Yes this is what is wrong with the world,  a person thinking his opinion is more valid then another person and saying he has to have valid evidence while not even having valid evidence himself!
Did you show 'valid evidence'? NO...
Again it is your opinion and that's all it is.
