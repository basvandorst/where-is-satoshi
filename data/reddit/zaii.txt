$6.97 in 2016 $13.72 now
If you jumped in 2016 you would be having a good time, if you jumped in 2008 you are having a very bad time

lets say (hypothetically) the price of bitcoin stabililzes, inflation in the us is about 2% a year
since bitcoin isn't prone to inflation the way american currency is then the same bitcoins will be worth 10% more than the dollar in 5 years even if the price of bitcoin doesn't change.
 (hypothetically)
the technology is sound and will have its use. 
just believe in the grand scope of the technology and you will see completely useful ideas in there even if you didn't become wealthy on the rise of it

buy when it hits what you are comfortable with, someone else's opinion shouldn't dictate how you manage your finances

It's like freaking groundhogs day in I wanted to give people some context when turbulence hits. 
In order to survive in this market you must have nerves of steel and have a belief in what you think the long term future of bitcoin will be.
Don't be a person who loses money 2x from selling when the price dips and then buys AGAIN when it has already risen.
