I DM'd it to you.  Let me know if you got it.

Yes.  I had a bitcoin with blockchain.info, then I moved the bitcoin to KnC Wallet.  That was the last time I could access the coin.  KnC Wallet appears defunct (KnC Miner is getting sued, etc).  I can see the transaction from blockchain.info to KnC Miner.  I can see the amount of bitcoin using the address and putting it into blockexplorer.  So the coin is still in KnC wallet (I think), but that is defunct (I'm trying to reach someone there).

I think I lost my BTC as it was in a KnC Wallet.  I have the app on my phone, but because KnCMiner is a big scam and filed for bankruptcy, the app won't send me an SMS to access my account.  I'm assuming KnC has my private keys on their servers somewhere, but I can't access them.  Already dumped my phone data and searched there, no private keys.  I have the transaction IDs, blockchain info for when I moved the coins from blockchain.info to KnC Wallet, but no way to access KnC Wallet.  Anyone have any thoughts?  I'm a bit of a noob, but have researched quite a bit.

Thanks Nicky.  Sorry if these are dumb questions, but I go to brainwallet and I put in my seed.  It then generates a bunch of stuff:
secret exponent
point conversion
address QR Code
ASN.1 Key
Public Key
HASH 160
Nothing called a private key.  What would I do now that I have all those fields above?
Also, if this is my seed for my old blockchain.info wallet, but then I transferred the bitcoin to KnC Wallet (where I think the bitcoin is actually in that wallet), how will it be able to essentially grab that coin out of KnC?
If you can help me and this is successful, I'd be happy to give you some compensation for helping me get this coin back.

Not sure who the KnC crowd would be at this point.  No URL, filed for bankruptcy.  There was no back up phrase (as far as I can recall).  Not even sure that would help.  I think it's more that the infrastructure for the app/wallet isn't online......at least that's what I've been able to figure out so far.
