If I were him I would cut down on planned speaking tours, with all the bitcoin he has he is now a target for kidnappers

Im so touched by this, I dont know why but Im actually tearing up...im so so happy for him.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:44:24
Lets keep this gravy train going lets hope someone can match him...I want him to be a bitcoin millionaire so ver can shove it
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:29:57
Is there a way to know how much the community has sent him? Itd be great if we couls get him a whole bitcoin

Wonder ehat he'll say when bitcoin hits 400k
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:03:44
Oh okay, I hope he gets more then...thanks for clearing that up

Its funny you word it like that as there's a hadith from the Prophet Muhammad that goes “Beware of envy, for it consumes good deeds just as fire consumes wood or grass.” Sorry irrelevant but the similarity struck me
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:08:21
We'll see. Some guy mortaged his house and put it all in crypto abt 6 months ago...hes a millionaire now
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:26:49
I feel knowing the fundamentals--revolutionary technology, limited supply, small market cap compared to other financial assets, makes buying bitcoin less of a gamble than say flipping a coin or putting it all on black. Im fairly confident bitcoin this time next year will be more than it is now, so doesnt seem like a 50/50 toss up to me
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:52:21
I agree. I would love to get to the point where my bitcoin could help less fortunate people. To me opening an orphanage or building houses for poor families in the 3rd world would be much more enriching than a lambo...not virtue signaling here but I think theres a lot of selfishness and materialism promoted here and ppl forget how amazing it is to utterly change someone's life for the better. I live in the third world and after a massive rally on bitcoin I gave a guy collecting recyclables 50 bucks, which was a fravtion of my earnings for that day. And he started weeping tears of joy. That was more valuable for me to see and have done than going 0-60 in under a few seconds in a new lambo or tesla
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:57:47
Ok but is that the total hes ever received or is that how much he currently owns? If he has 56 bitcoin I kinda regret sending him so much as hes many orders of magnitude richer than me

I liked seeing everyones exuberance 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:15:51
I had the same problem it was infuriating, then guess what the china fud came in and my funds cleared after it fell from 5000 to 2900 and I was so thankful I was delayed, you never know you might get lucky too and get ur funds available on a huge pull back
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:29:28
This debate is pretty awesome u are both very intelligent and articulate and make good points. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:48:25
Curious why you think "most likely" bitcoin will go to zero? Seen so many bulls am curious for your bearish perspective 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:15:08
I have an unverified acct and also thousands on bittrex which I havent tried to withdraw because I havent had time to set up a wallet for all the alts I bought...what should I do? Withdraw .025 a day? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:28:36
Him owning gold is like being friendzoned by the hot chick while she picks some other hot chad, def gonna create a nice guy syndrome for bitcoin...bitterness, envy...hard to overcome those things 
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:27:42
To play devils advocate (since  im a bitcoin bull), gold had a crazy run up to almost 2000/oz during the recession, and it has been at or around 1400 for 11 YEARS...gold bugs have been waiting for another bull market for 11 years...market cycles dont work when govt and banks work together to supress the price of something.

You can do that with localbitcoins.com with individuals but on an exchange they will basically buy your bitcoin back and credit u w dollars which u can transfer to ur bank
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:56:20
Exchange it for real money on an exchange like coinbase

41% of world currency seems unattainable, so much for my hopes of million dollar bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:10:42
Do u really think itd go to 0? Seems highly unlikely...as soon as it gets below 1000 all those ppl who missed the boat will see their opportunity and buy, think theres too many ppl now to let it go to nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:29:22
I would like to know the answer to this too
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:08:04
Hasanat are going to be the bitcoin of the akira, only way way bigger...keep your eyes on the prize

B2x is trading on futures markets...the price is 1800, which means a lot of ppl think it will wim the civil war, if btc was going to be the clear winner itd be worth nothing. And its not clear if the winner will be decided so fast. Best strategy is to hold and sell a portion of ur btc for fiat in case of a big correction
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:11:48
Good thing Im almost finished buying al my bitcoin and refuse to look at the price for the next 5 yrs....to be honest its easier just being ignorantly blissful and totally forgetting about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:19:54
Do u think thats a good idea considering the price of b2x is now 2000 dollars? So you are predicting then that bitcoim will drop lower than 2k? What if everyone sells rheir b2x so suddenly a shit load of money comes into btc and the price rockets, especially since theres no uncertainty left...feels like a risky move...im personally selling 25% into fiat before the fork in case youre right and it does crash, but would be hesitant to sell everything

Please trust me, dont try and time the market, most of the time youll get rekt. Day trading bitcoin is like day trading stocks, 95% lose money. Just buy and hold for as long as you can..at all time highs like this its better to dollar cost average and buy in chunks every day, ive been buying every day for about 2 months now, sure I would have made more buying all at once, but its a riskier option. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:17:48
Yes I felt late to the game as saw the prices sky rocket but wasnt able to convert my fiat to bitcoin because of various banking reasons...i was getting so pissed and fomoing hard, and then this happened and im so grateful i didnt dump all my portdolio at 4600...I cant wait for it to get below 2000

Dont listen to this guy, dont keep your coins on a wallet research what happened to mt gox 4 yrs ago and how many ppl lost their bitcoins followimg that advice. Get a wallet and store them there, buy two flash disks and save ur seed there and write it down on a piece of paper for good measure
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:29:48
How many bitcoin did you end up losing if you dont mind me asking?
