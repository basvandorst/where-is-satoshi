Oh look, it's the 'someone disagrees with my idiot opinion based on speculation and me being mad at Bitmain so they must be a shill' mantra.
Go fuck yourself kid. I couldn't care less about Bitmain or how they are financially cause I got fuck-all reason to 'shill' them. 
I just think it's pathetic to make unsubstantial claims based on a few shit articles that speculate that a company posted a billion dollar profit for Q1 suddenly is broke Q2.
I mean sure, if you think 'bitmain is killing crypto' go ahead and whine about it, but don't try to make it seem objective.
PS. Jihan can go fuck himself as far as I'm concerned, cause he seems like a divisive douchebag but that doesn't mean 'bitmain is failing' just cause you want it to be that way. Oh no, now I won't get paid for my shilling I guess.

Or just showcasing their 7nm ASIC. Like them or not, pretending like Bitmain is 'gonna go bankrupt' is simply a pathetic mental exercise.

Where are all the "Bitmain is now bankrupt" muppets now?

Literally nothing in this comment is true. Just because you read a headline speculating that a company with BILLION dollar reserves may be doing less fantastic than it is doesn't mean 'its bankrupt'. You not liking the company also doesn't mean 'it's bankrupt'.

And then it turned out they were Russian assets all along. Egg on who's face again?

If you think they would start losing $500 million per quarter all of a sudden I don't think you understand how business works.

That's not how accounting works. $400M in 'losses' doesn't mean they are out of money, it means they are writing down stock value etc.
