Well, if companies are saying that the fees and transaction issues are a problem, then it's a problem. Your opinion does not affect the real world use cases for BTC which is steadily declining until they scale.

Mindlessly pandering? While I see BTC as a store of value it's still the one name ppl think of when crypto currency is mentioned. If you want BTC to succeed then you should be upset that it's being dropped as a medium of payment. 
Who knows though maybe DASH could finally be known as the best payment option.

I'd transfer out with Gemini.

They need to implement this asap. 
These transfer times are getting to be fucking ridiculous.

Launching my new website dedicated to crypto along with content on the 1st. 
Super excited for the New Year but I'll most definitely be taking a break.

BTC will most likely retest the $6850-$6750 range over the course of the next day before making another push up. I can go into some more details that discuss T.A but idk how this sub feels about it. I'm a regular in r/BitcoinMarkets.

$7175 - $7200 is the next big resistance level. Most likely we will retest the low $6800s/high $6700s before pushing to the mid $7k and then we will see what happens there.

That corner is 2 or 3 blocks away lol. I haven't seen that car at the local meetup yet.

This man gets it, the guy complaining can't be that bright or hasn't watched it because majestics response is exactly on point.
As someone who is invested in Bitcoin I'm surprised you aren't into it.

Fucking floppy disks, they still mention that ancient shit in CompTia certification books.
