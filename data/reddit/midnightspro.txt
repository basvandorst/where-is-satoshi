No joke I have a picture of a 14 gram joint for my birthday and under the joint is the paper I had my Btc wallet written down, so I see 10 out 12 the joint is covering 2
@_date: 2019-11-19 02:26:54
I only know 10 out of 12 words for my private key and there’s 0.76 Btc ������ Lost that awhile ago
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:16:31
I know the correct order it’s in just don’t know the 2 words
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:17:37
Hell yeah but I just got my drugs I actually been trying to switch my Btc to BAT and a few others I’m interested in lol

Why are you gonna have malware on your Pc? If malware steals your BTC you deserve it lmao
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:58:38
Were you not here back in 2017 when fees were wild as fuck? Lmao
Ps if you think $20 is a lot stop investing and maybe go work a little more so you don’t live check to check ������

You sexy fuck I got 1/3 confirmations! It worked appreciate the help brother have a great day!
@_date: 2019-04-21 02:33:12
Tweaker where?? Maybe they have more meth! Lmao I’m all honesty though my life is fantastic, I make plenty of money that I’m more than happy with, about to get a great job in another state than start attending college, so...... my life is pretty straight, at least I don’t have a kid like most idiots ��
Ps drugs are fun!

Have you kept up with BAT recently? It’s gaining a lot of popularity and the price has been increasing this entire month, everyone said BTC was worthless when it first started, no one knows, Stellar is def a toss up but super cheap so 40k coins is a nice stockpile Incase anything does happen

Just saying it’s pretty hard to get any virus/malware on your PC, it’s like people who type in the wrong URL and type in their username and password to a fake site, well it’s your fault, if you get scammed it’s your fault, got a virus, it’s your fault, like I never feel sorry for these type of people

Try south lol

Bro no one is here for the “technology” everyone is here to make money if you say otherwise your lying to yourself, everyone loves money. Also buying drugs online much safer than meeting your dealer in a corner alley lol.

It was more of a joke about it being laughable I’ve been with Btc since 2016, not everyone gets my sarcasm but I don’t mind it, maybe he ain’t having a good day and needs a hug ��
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:39:31
Only idiots are the ones who lose money ����
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:33:49
I can respect that lol
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:44:22
Bruh that was amazing
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:19:23
Hmm I like that, I’ll send another transaction, appreciate it!
Edit: Added a $20 fee transaction so hopefully that works :)
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:22:08
Only .5 not a full one, but that gives me enough to drop a decent amount in a few others. I’ve already am invested in Btc so don’t need any more, I do need more ETH tho

Doing drugs doesn’t make you a loser, putting others down makes you a loser, not helping anyone in your life makes you a loser, hurting people makes you a loser, what people do in their own time is their business and judging others also makes you a loser.
You don’t have to be a loser forever, you could be but you decide
PS you would be surprised how many drug users there are, almost every cop in my city which is a big ass city does Meth and Coke, do you consider them losers even though they go through hell each day and put their lives on the line for others? Think about what you say to others, than question yourself, it’ll help in the long run. You seem very unhappy with life sorry no one loves you :) I’ll love you though (Hugs)
@_date: 2019-04-21 01:36:51
I used to send like $200 when I sent 2k a few years ago so $20 isn’t bad
Edit: I just want my money lol
@_date: 2019-04-21 02:34:09
That’s weird the fee was 11 Sat and it’s been 16 hours but it’s finally confirming, maybe my luck was just crap today lol
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:34:33
Granted I invested a lot a few weeks prior in everything so I’m back to being 20% positive!
