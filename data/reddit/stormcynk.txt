They probably don't have access to all the information the prosecution has gathered yet to determine if they can prove he did run it, so she's doing the smart thing and not talking about it yet.

SEO isn't just based on searches.  The best way to something highly ranked in Google is to have a bunch of links pointing to it from a bunch of sites that have good content (crawled by Google's spider) and have a bunch of links pointing to those sites.

A couple hundred dollars. Maybe $400 max. I've looked into the block eruptors, but is there a way to get them through an official channel, with a warranty and everything? The only ways I've seen of getting them are through group buys, which I'm not quite sure how they work, or through eBay or equivalent, which I'm not sure will maintain the warranty. Any information would be great!

I'm not mining with my cpu, I'm mining with my GTX 670M. But still, it's not mining terribly fast.
