I saw the thread immediately after ordering, and cursed myself for not looking into them further before actually clicking the confirm button. I saw a few conflicting reports in the comments, some people saying they were legit, and then thought fuck it I won't look into it too much. I thought I had already ordered, I will just hope for the best.
Over one month later, its still processing and I just thought I would ask some of you guys and see what you think. Thanks for confirming exactly what I thought. lol cheers mate.

Thank you. I received my gold today, almost 3 months later. I sent this email to Jason from coinabul. If anybody reads it, please tell me what you think.








On the date of my order, 25/08/2013, BTC were trading for around $120 US / BTC and around $130 AUD / BTC. This means I sent you around $280-$300 AUD worth of BTC at the time of the order.




                   &gt;&gt;Hi there I would like a refund on my order asap. Thank you.














  **[Excerpts from the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Business Centre]( 
- [Business Guide to the FTC's Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule](






* **If, after taking the customer’s order, you learn that you cannot ship within the time you stated or within 30 days, you must seek the customer’s consent to the delayed shipment. If you cannot obtain the customer’s consent to the delay -- either because it is not a situation in which you are permitted to treat the customer’s silence as consent and the customer has not expressly consented to the delay, or because the customer has expressly refused to consent -- you must, without being asked, promptly refund all the money the customer paid you for the unshipped merchandise.**








* **If you decide you can ship the order later, you must seek the customer’s consent to the delay. You may use whatever means you wish to do this -- such as the telephone, fax, mail, or email -- as long as you notify the customer of the delay reasonably quickly. The customer must have sufficient advance notification to make a meaningful decision to consent to the delay or cancel the order.
* In any event, no notification to the customer can take longer than the time you originally promised or, if no time was promised, 30 days. If you cannot ship the order or provide the notice within this time, you must cancel the order and make a prompt refund.**






the customer does not respond to your first notice of a definite revised shipment date of 30 days or less and you have not shipped the merchandise or received the customer’s consent to a further delay by the definite revised shipment date;
* the customer does not respond to your notice of a definite revised shipment date of more than 30 days (or your notice that you are unable to provide a definite revised shipment date) and you have not shipped the merchandise within 30 days of the original shipment date;
* the customer consents to a definite delay and you have not shipped or obtained the customer’s consent to any additional delay by the shipment time the customer consented to;
* **you have not shipped or provided the required delay or renewed option notices on time**; or
you determine that you will never be able to ship the merchandise.




* When the mails are involved, the Postal Service also has authority to take action for problems such as non-delivery. State law enforcement agencies can take action for violating state consumer protection laws.
 * Apart from this, your failure to ship on time, or your failure to notify your customers promptly about delays and to obtain their consent to the delays, or your failure to make full and prompt refunds when your customers do not consent to delayed shipment, can adversely affect your business by discouraging repeat purchases.* Accordingly, most businesses regard compliance with the Rule as simply good business practice.

Yeah, I have made practically no effort,  because I have not KNOWN what to do! It has been about a month, I have sent multiple emails and tried to call the contact number multiple times, what would you recommend I do, apart from perhaps posting a question on a bitcoin subreddit about what should I do?
and I have pretty much accepted these coins as a loss, and a lesson in doing my research into companies before I purchase goods from them, but if posting for help to a bitcoin forum can help, then why not?
You're calling people passive aggressive, while you are being a passive aggressive douche, yourself. I will be upfront aggressive. Go fuck yourself. I made a mistake buying from a dodgy supplier, and I am willing to accept the consequences.

Oh and regarding not having coins to sell, the longest I have ever seen that up on their page is around 3 to 4 hours. They don't seem to run out for long.

Haha you dont even need to open an account with them. You just goto their buy page and type in your bitcoin address, desired amounts of bitcoin, email addy and which bank you will deposit the money at. CLick next and it gives you an account number and order number to deposit it to. 
Go to the bank within 4 hours of receiving your quote and deposit the cash, keep the receipt just in case, but realisitically you should have your BTC within an hour or so of depositing the money to their account.

I would also like to see this answered. I assume that it is the miners that decide whether to adopt any updates thought isn't it, not just merely bitcoin holders, but those adding computational power to the network?
