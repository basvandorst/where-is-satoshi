I just checked my sources and ran the numbers. I have a lot of experience doing this and I haven’t been wrong once. I know coming from a random redditor that seems unbelievable, but trust me. I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be right after you buy any appreciable amount of btc

Oh, I guess it is, huh

I fucking love this. Thank you.

This may have been conveyed to you elsewhere within this post, but to add to your list of differences:
- r/bitcoin Is in favor of striving to keep Bitcoin decentralized and as free from manipulation as possible. 
- r/btc Is in favor of keeping power (and therefor access to profits) in the hands of the big miners, by way of ensuring ASICBOOST's and other mining hacks' continued presence in Bitcoin's blockchain code. 
That's what it's really boiled down to for me: 
Big Guys with Lots of Money who are Hungry for More
Small Guys with Ideals and Morals who are Stubborn and Forward-thinking
EDIT: I think this thread is one of my favorite summaries of what's going on:

Dog, what? I would say, when you're talking about *spending your own money*, and in some cases, large amounts of that money, ease and safety are literally the most important factors.

Have you heard of Google, Amazon, and Apple? Of course you have. People were probably talked down from buying those things as well, and lost out because of it.
What about Enron, Palm, Borders, Blockbuster, Kodak? You've probably heard of them, and how they've all failed. What about Standard Oil, Pan-Am, Woolworth's? Likely not. All of those companies went from being huge successes to utterly finished, and I'm sure the whole way people were debating whether or not to get invested. Some did and won out, then lost it all. Some didn't and were happy they made that choice.
You *cannot* read the market. No one can. If you could, people would do it all the time. Sometimes they try, and sometimes they get lucky, but the only sure thing has always been diverse stocks that rise on average as the economy rises. Bitcoin is the same. There's no way to know what the future will hold for Cryptocurrency.
I know it hurts to hear, because you want to believe that you and your friends are special, but you got lucky. Bitcoin could have failed at many points, and moreover, it could still fail. Acting like your success means that Bitcoin will continue to thrive is pure fallacy. Are there good things going for Bitcoin? Sure. But there are bad things, too.
I want you to be right. I would *love* for bitcoin to hit 5000USD at some point. But I don't think you're doing yourself or anyone else any favors when you talk like it's a sure thing, because it's simply impossible to know that.

Either. Look up MTGOX, Cryptsy, Dogecoin's "Mohland". Whether it's through hacking, poor business management or outright criminal activity on the part of the exchange, there's high chance of volatility where this stuff is concerned.

I have to disagree. If it's hard for you to spend your money on a thing you want, and spending that money may result in you not getting the thing you want, you are far less likely to try and buy that thing.
I'm not saying *no one* will do it. People's thresholds for this stuff are different. But I'm sorry, it's just silly if you think Bitcoin being hard to buy and easy to lose aren't the two main reasons people are wary of owning them.

And this sounds like a fundamental misunderstanding of what Roger Ver is trying to do.
What do you think happens when rich people band together to control a majority of the hash power of the collective mining community? This is what Ver and others (Jihan) are trying to do. They're pushing hard for changes on Aug 1st that will help ensure they can. Don't support Ver.

How did people lose their entire holdings? Did they have panic sell-points at certain prices set up?

25$ a week is nothing. I do 100$ a month.
