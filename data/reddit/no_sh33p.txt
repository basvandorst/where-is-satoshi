First, it doesn't explain why Ver was so confident it will happen in 2017.
Second, in the post you linked:


But they supported trade out of the bat. Misleading info or a lie. 


Congrats (for real) this time. I have nothing against you and I'm happy to see you make money based on your correct speculation. But I think other ppl like Ver weren't simply speculating, they knew. See the other posts for plenty of evidences of such coordinated effort. This post is just another piece to corroborate the theory.

I also switched to Gemini long before this week. It's been great. The web UI is very easy to use and money transfer is as seamless as Coinbase. Support is very courteous and responsive (this was months ago, now may be tough for them with the influx of new customers migrated from Coinbase). I have absolutely no complain. I hodl and don't trade, so can't talk about trading experience.

I think the OP may actually blame Ver because Ver and his "friends" cheated.

It doesn't matter what happen to the price, the manipulation is pretty obvious and needs calling out. Just because it failed to tank bitcoin price doesn't mean we should ignore as if it never happened.


Did you read what I said before commenting?

Here's the quick way: click the the front page of any crypto reddit or go to Twitter and search coinbase. That fiasco. But you know it already, just appearing to be a smart ass. Just stop.

Say another hypocrite, unless, of course, you're here not because you care about gain.
Now, there's the right way to make money and there's the wrong (even illegal) way. Did you parents teach you that much?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:02
Yes. But not by cheating, lying, brand stealing (first "bcash is a better Bitcoin", then now "bcash is bitcoin") and outright manipulation.

Because I don't have any and don't plan to buy any.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:44:13
Because btc is awesome and thrives regardless. What's your point?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:30:29
Yep, this entire fiasco is a big coincidence. That happens once in a while, who knows. Or maybe it's not, which is a simpler explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:20:16
Oh, I didn't know that it was that obvious. You must have made ton of money! Congrats. Now, since you're spending time here instead of having a big celebration, I would assume it wasn't that obvious even to you. Please show the proof of "Coinbase announced weeks ago that they'll distribute Bch in december"

Acknowledge this. Just pointed a specific case out in the other sub  He quickly deleted the post starting with "I am a Bitcoin Core supporter..." line. Can't believe people would have the time and lack of decency to resort to such tactic. I get their money is at stake, but I doubt if most of these people have enough money worth of selling their soul. Yet they did. Sad.

Hi as a newbie, I'd like to see your response to the parent's questions and this

Does it matter who posts it? Anything to say about the post itself?
