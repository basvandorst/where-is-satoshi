Hosting is definitely something that I would buy in Bitcoins. Because BTC is essentially an online-only currency many people who receive money in BTC also spend money on hosting. Having no conversions there would be a good thing.
I don't think there is anything specific about Bitcoin though. What you should do is what every hosting company should do but few do:
- Don't look shady. Look like you are still going to be around in two years. Avoid upsells. Have a return policy.
- Have some personality. Funny name, consistent design, a clear value proposition. I like how A Small Orange does it. Don't put generic datacenter pictures on top of a black-background WHMCS theme please.
- Look like there are proud humans behind the service. Hostgator did an ad campaign that showed their staffers working on their servers and their owner talking.
- Be clear about what you are selling. No Support Linux Hosting does a great job making clear that they don't do support! Everything is ok as long as you make it clear. Avoid crap about world-class datacenters: which datacenter? Which hardware? Can you sustain your performance claims?
and most importantly:
- Charge a fair price for your product. I'd rather pay more and see you still around than see you go under in months because you can't run a business on zero profit. Make money please!

I find it easier to think in £/$/Euro than in BTC. You should make clear what happens if there is a huge swing in BTC prices though.
