I don't care much about the particular exchange rate, but I do care about price stability.  
I'd *like* to put some savings in Bitcoin, but I have absolutely no idea if they'll be vapourized in a year when the price crashes to $2, or if I'll be a billionaire when it skyrockets to $2.5 million.  
I know with some certainty how much bread or airtime 1 USD or 1 EUR will buy a year from now.  The same can't be said for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is, at least for me, too volatile to hold.

As I pointed out elsewhere, much of it falls onto the public in practice.
In my country, while workplace insurance is mandatory, it's partially subsidized by the government.  In practice, many of the costs end up being covered by public health insurance (which is universal) or social assistance.  In all cases, the public pays much of the bill if a worker gets injured.
That's simply the reality.  One could make an argument that things would be different or better with some weird libertarian ideal where those programs don't exist, but that's not the world we currently live in.
A worker who gets injured is a burden on the public,  An employer that injures workers while keeping their costs down is being subsidized by the public.  Ergo, the public has a stake in workers not being injured and in preventing employers from using workers as disposable cogs to maximize profits.

And I'm also unsure what your comment has to do with my original comment, which is about how it unjust for people to burden the public by injuring or disabling themselves to make a quick buck.  
Workplace injuries are an externality foisted primarily onto the public through universal healthcare and social assistance, the public most certainly has a stake in workers not being injured.

I know for a fact that, at least here in Canada, there are private businesses that trade foreign currencies in a free market with no government control over the prices, and that banks operate on the same system.

That's a bit naive.
The socioeconomic and cultural forces that drive Western legal hegemony (such as drug prohibition) are beyond any "corporate interests" and entirely pervade our societies from the average citizen up.
Those law enforcement agencies from European countries cooperated most likely out of earnest interest, in the belief that stopping the drug trade is good for their societies, their children and even just enforcing the natural order of things.  They weren't strong-armed -- they almost certainly did it willingly out of faith, just as their governments willingly passed drug control laws and signed international conventions prohibiting narcotics trafficking.
The "lie" (which isn't even a lie, so much as a generally coherent self-perpetuating worldview that people are emotionally, socially, financially and culturally invested in) is very big, and believed by most.

Well, Detroit is mostly because of misallocated taxes, and a dependence on the (disappearing) local property tax base to fund local services.
Look across the river to Windsor.  
Windsor has been experiencing the same economic conditions with the collapse of the North American auto industry, but because hospitals, roads, etc., in Windsor are primarily funded out of Ontario's general revenue (a much larger and diverse revenue base) via transfers to the municipality, their civic services haven't crumbled nearly as severely.
If Michigan had income and sales taxes like in Ontario, at the state level, and then transferred funds to prop up municipal governments rather than forcing municipal governments to rely on local revenue, Detroit would not be in the situation it is in.  (Though of course, it would still be in a lot of trouble given the collapse of the local economy).

A rapidly deflationary currency makes loans extremely problematic.
There's always the option of a negative interest rate.
Let's assume bitcoin is the global currency. If bitcoins deflate fairly stably at 10% per year, if you loan someone some money and credit them an interest rate of 5%, you still increase your effective net worth by the difference.
Let's assume two things.  1 BTC = $10 USD at the start, and that the USD is an entirely stable currency (inflation rate 0%) and BTC deflate at 10% a year.  
You start with 10 BTC.  After a year it's worth $110.  If you loan someone 10 BTC at 5% interest rate in BTC, at the end of a year they owe you 10.5 BTC or $115.  If the same loan were made in USD, they'd only owe you $105.
However, if you credit someone a 5% interest rate against the loan, you loan them 10 BTC and at the end of the term you credit them 0.5 BTC.  They pay you back 9.5 BTC.  You started with 10 BTC and ended with 9.5 BTC on the loan.  However, your net worth went from $100 to $104.5 USD.
Edit: edited for clarity and added an example.
Edit 2: Of course, I completely miss the point that it'd be more sensible to hold on to your 10 BTC anyway.  Oh well, interesting idea anyway :P

Okay, paper money representing gold is indeed a 19th century phenomenon, but that's nitpicking.  Fractional reserve was done *with gold and silver coins* before that.  It's been done in Europe since the Renaissance. 
Anyway, those 800 BTC certainly do exist... they're in the hands of the debtors! (at least, until they're spent), it's more that the *deposits* are what don't really exist.
Let's assume that the money supply is a fixed 1000 BTC.  If a bank has 500 BTC in deposits and has loaned out 200 BTC, the perceived monetary supply is 1200 BTC.  The amount of money in the hands of people other than the bank is 1000 BTC, there's no problem, in theory, at this point of one of the debtors earning a portion of the non-bank-held BTC to repay their loan.
It'd only be a problem if *all* of the monetary supply were deposited in banks then loaned out.

Yes, it theoretically can.
In fact, it *did* with the gold standard for hundreds of years.
If ten people deposit 100 BTC with a bank, the bank has 1000 BTC, the bank can then loan out say, 800 BTC to a variety of debtors. 
The *perceived* monetary supply is now 1800 BTC.
So long as the accountholders don't try and actually withdraw their money (or at least, more than a small fraction of the overall deposits), this can be maintained.

IANAL, etc. etc. 
In a fair court (one not overly biased regarding e-currencies (the MMO companies have a lot invested in them not being declared property, etc.) here in my jurisdiction (Canada) I think this would be the tort of conversion from a civil perspective, and should be similar for any other common law countries.
Are Bitcoins property?  That would require them to be uniquely possessable, transferable and to have value.  IMO Bitcoin does meet these requirements, though it could take a lot to argue that to a judge successfully.  The fact that it's intangible isn't very important, numbers representing money written on a ledger are still property.  Notably, copying data stored in computers (and then deleted) has been considered conversion.
The principles of lost and abandoned property cannot be applied here, since the receiver knows who the owner is and knows how to contact him.
Conversion is the unlawful deprival of the use or possession of property.  Basically the civil equivalent of theft.  It is a strict liability tort, intent is not required.  
The property is not his.  Possession is not ownership.  The sender retains legal ownership, a refusal to return the property is depriving the lawful owner of his property, and is conversion.
It's also the crime of theft, most likely.

In practice, sure it has potentially negative consequences, but in itself it is not wrong.

Asset forfeiture as in this case is separate from the criminal proceeding.  The assets would have been forfeit even if all the criminal charges had been dropped (or even if he was never arrested).
If the seizure was never contested, as I believe was so in the Ulbricht case, then that's that.
If he were to contest the seizure, the government must establish, to the standard of evidence in a civil trial, that the assets were involved in or proceeds from the commission of a crime.  Given the coins were seized from a drug trafficking website, I don't think they'll have that hard of a time doing that.
But just hypothetically, if the judge were to rule in Ulbricht's favour, then the government would have to reimburse him for the value of the coins, yes.

The real danger lies not in the NSA (or anyone else) having the ability to brute force ECDSA or any other algorithm.  The problem is they employ some half of cryptographers in the world and a huge portion of the brightest mathematicians and computer scientists in the world.
Algorithms have had structural weaknesses in the past that, in effect, reduce their effective keysize.   The last algorithm actually broken just by expansion of computing power into the realm of being able to bruteforce it was DES.  No one has made the mistake of a 56 bit key since.
However, algorithms have been rendered insecure by faster-than-bruteforce analysis by flaws in either implementation or design.
Hypothetical Bitcoin attack scenario: The implementation of pseudorandom number generation in Linux or Windows is precisely that -- pseudo -- to the NSA.  With this knowledge, the effective keyspace for an attack for the NSA is within the realm of bruteforce.  Thus they have the ability to forge ECDSA private keys when random number generation is based on the algorithms used in those operating systems.  Thus they can falsify a transaction where the generation of the private keys was done on those operating systems.  Any transaction after the date they discovered this flaw would be unreliable if they were attacking the network.  
It's not *highly* implausible.  Insufficient randomness in pseudorandom number generators have caused many security holes before.
Think of it as a ramped up version of the same attack that caused problems with blockchain.info's wallet recently.

* Bitcoin erodes the state's ability to manipulate the currency.  This has its upsides but it also has many drawbacks.  In particular, it would eliminate the ability to control inflation and the money supply.  It also has ramifications for taxation.
* Speaking of which, it would make tax evasion much easier.
* The anonymous and untraceable aspects of Bitcoin present real issues.  It's easy to sit and shrug when it's kids buying drugs from The Silk Road ... but how will you feel when it's being used to finance terrorism or factional warfare?
* Limited range of trading.

No reason national governments can't impose a property tax, and many do.
Employers have no particular incentive to enable their employees to cheat on income tax.  There's little reason *not* to report actual values to the revenue agency, and good reasons (like serious fines and even jail time) to not help commit tax fraud.
Sales taxes are fairly hard to cheat on, on a large scale.  Much of their volume is still in cash, yet sales taxes account for a large proportion of the income in some states -- as much as 50% of the revenue in the high VAT states of Europe.
The end of the state because of the difficulty of taxing Bitcoin is grossly overstated, I think.

I'm not sure I agree.
Western governments implemented fairly effective income taxes back when we were primarily cash economies.  You can indeed hide your income and your investments more easily with Bitcoin, but that's only half the equation.
Revenue agencies already have tools to deal with unreported cash income -- So sir, can you explain how you could afford that $90,000 yacht and $950,000 mortgage on your $18,000 a year salary?
And of course, most employers will have relatively little incentive to break the law for *your* benefit, and will report your income.  The possibility of using foreign banks does complicated the matter.
Bitcoin would of course make it *easier* to commit fraud, but not necessarily to the point where it causes income tax systems to break down.

And I disagree.  Making tax evasion easier is a downside.  I suspect most people who believe in the utility of the state in solving problems (almost everyone?) will view it as a downside.
Anyway, I don't think would make it much easier for the common man.  The common man will continue to derive his income from his labour, which will probably continue to be reported to the tax agency by his employer and so on.
It however, would it much easier (easier than it already is) for the wealthy and very wealthy to evade taxes.  Anyone who makes the majority of their wealth not from their labour from use of their capital would benefit tremendously.

There will be some people who move out of the wealthy into the extremely wealthy, no doubt.  Much like how entrepreneurs in America or Europe sometimes become quite wealthy.  Some already have -- there's quite a few Bitcoin millionaires who may have had relatively little before.
That being said, I don't think it will be significant on a global scale.  The advantages held by the ultrawealthy already will be applied to Bitcoin and within a short time they will control the majority of it, as they already do everything else.
On a global scale, the extremely poor are still completely out of both the fiat and Bitcoin loop.  Some 3 billion+ people don't have any Internet access, even by mobile phone and some 3+ billion people don't participate in formalized economic systems *at all* relying solely on what they can grow and barter.  They will continue to remain out of the Bitcoin loop for some time, while the vast majority of Bitcoin will become entrenched in the hands of the wealthy much as other currencies and commodities are already today.  
There will be no significant redistribution of wealth along those lines.
I actually worry that a deflationary currency will accelerate the processes that result in wealth concentration by discouraging the wealthy to invest (and thus circulate their currency) rather than simply hold their assets, but we'll have to see if that holds true.

If we treat it like any other property then you don't have to prove they're responsible for the robbery.  
The legal principle in almost all countries is that, once you are aware that property is stolen, you are obligated to return it to the rightful owner even if you didn't steal it yourself and even if you were unaware it was stolen property when you acquired it.
If I buy a stereo off Craigslist from a nice respectable-looking person and then the real owner shows up and demonstrates that it's rightfully theirs, I have to return it to them.  Failure to do so is both a crime and a tort in my jurisdiction (as with almost every other).  The obligation falls on the buyer to ensure that their acquisitions are not the proceeds of crime.
It will be very interesting to see how this applies to Bitcoin.

I'd like to try this again. It's bothering me that we got off on the wrong foot. I assume you're not a troll based on your karma and comment history and I try to at least be able talk to people regardless of their political beliefs. 
I may have been a little presumptuous for rejecting your definition of "regulation" and I'm sorry for being dismissive. 


I don't deny that many regulations are harmful, counterproductive or meant to serve the interests of a select few to the detriment of everyone else. 
But I personally feel that arguing against all of them would be like tossing the entire criminal code because you disagree with some of the provisions in it. 


Could you please explain why they're imaginary? I'm not sure I understand where you're coming from. To me, e.g. pollution is an act that wrongs others. Do you consider, e.g. dumping mercury into the air to not be "doing stuff"? Are you saying that polluting doesn't harm anyone? Or are you saying that it doesn't count as aggression to you?  If so, why if aggression your threshold and not harm?
Assuming we accept it as harmful, regulation seems the natural method to deal with this. The only other option I can even think of would be to sue the polluter, but in some cases that seems to be entirely unworkable to me. Would everyone who breathes sue every car owner?
I guess more generally I'm wondering how you propose dealing with externalities in general?
Sorry if there's any assumptions I've made that are incorrect. I have to confess that the angle you're coming from in terms of political philosophy is one I have little familiarity with.

Apologies for the delay in response.
I didn't answer the question originally because I consider it disingenuous.  In effect, it's a logic trap, trying to force an uncomfortable admission.  When it comes to public discourse, I don't view that as a particularly fair tactic.
In which scenario does it become acceptable?  When it's on a socially organized scale -- such as at the level of the state administering taxation.  It *is* morally acceptable to use force to redistribute wealth when sanctioned in a free and democratic society, where due process is respected.  Such as taxation in a liberal democracy.
I don't believe this to be inconsistent with it being unacceptable to extract the wealth yourself through force.
Some acts are acceptable when done on an organized, societal level that would be unacceptable to undertaken by an individual unilaterally.  Wealth redistribution is one of those.
I would draw the comparison to crime and punishment.  It's wrong (vigilantism) to go after someone who stole from you and exact your own version of punishment.  However, as a society we don't object to the state having the right to use force to prevent crimes and to deal with criminals after the fact.
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:05:24
Some ideas off the top of my head (some of which may already exist as regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions):
* Identification and volume tracking regulations for exchanges for tax and anti-moneylaundering purposes 
* Require businesses that pay employees via Bitcoin to report their salaries to the tax authority.
* Requiring institutions that offer securities to adhere to various regulations on investments
* Regulations on loans and mortgages in Bitcoins in relation to terms, usury provisions, etc.
* Regulations on what reserve has to be kept by banks dealing in deposit accounts in Bitcoin, and things like deposit insurance, etc.
Some of these will be more enforceable than others.  
I certainly see widespread compliance with, for example, income reporting by employers.  Employers have little to gain by misreporting here, and a fairly steep penalty for doing so.  
I also expect regulations on, e.g., loans and mortgages to be followed -- if the debt you contracted was illegal then the courts will not enforce it which leaves you f'd when your debtor defaults.

I agree with the analysis that both inflation and deflation are effectively wealth transfers, but I don't reach the same conclusion about the outcome of those transfers. 


There's a couple underlying assumptions here I don't agree with. 
My analysis of the same facts: 
Most money is already held by the rich.  The rich will naturally increase their proportion without ongoing, active intervention because laissez-faire markets naturally fail over time into monopoly.  
Deflation increases the wealth of those with proportionately more wealth to essential expenses.  A poor man *needs* to spend 95% of his income every year or he has no roof over his head or food.  A very wealthy person does not.  The wealthy man gets wealthier over time, the poor man does not. 


Yes, exactly. Inflation forces old wealth and new wealth into the market where it can be taxed for redistribution.  This isn't just good for "government", it's good for everyone that benefits from government expenditure.  Government vs. the people rhetoric is only applicable in totalitarian societies.

It's not like the legal system has never dealt with the question of theft of money (especially cash) before.
Did the person report the theft to the police?  Did the disappearance of the money *look* like a theft?  Was there a break-in (physical or digital)?  Is there a suspect for the theft?  Did the person have a motivation for making the cash "disappear" and then claim theft, like insurance or illegal dealings?
It's true that in many cases that what you've said would cast doubt on whether a theft really occurred.  However, civil law generally requires only a preponderance of the evidence, not reasonable doubt.  In court if you're suing for the return of your money and the court is treating it like property, you'd only have to establish the likelihood that it was a theft, not absolute proof.

Well, I have two objections against it.
The first is more moral than practical economic.  A deflationary currency creates a first mover advantage.  Someone with a wad of cash and sitting on it, even without doing anything -- labour or investment, is profiting through a value transfer to them from everyone else.  Money for nothing, as it were. People talk about how inflationary currencies "steal" from those with savings.  Deflationary currencies "steal" from those who don't already have a large amount of savings.
Secondly: Yes, you're right that no one would just stop investing with a deflationary currency.  There will always be investments that yield greater return.  My concern is that, especially in turbulent times with defaults and bank runs and such, that people may opt to simply sit on their cash rather than risk investing it, sharply decreasing the availability of funds in a downturn.

George Ought To Help: 
First counterargument: There is a faulty assumption that *George's wealth is rightfully George's alone*.
I'd ask an anarchocapitalist -- is it okay to use force to reclaim stolen property that is rightfully yours?  The answer is usually yes, isn't it?
George's got his wealthy by benefitting from others -- including infrastructure, public education, enforcement of private property by the state, etc.  To take those without repaying is almost literally theft.  So, yes, it's quite moral to use force to take wealth from George considering it's effectively stolen property. 
Second counterargument: The false belief that private property isn't violently backed just like taxation.
Imagine someone grows food -- a vast surplus of food in fact, which he then sells for material luxuries and various frivolous things.  His claim to this property is backed by force, no?  He has a right to call the police (or in some jurisdictions, just grab a shotgun) and confront anyone who would try to take it.
Let's consider a scenario then.  A hungry man walks onto the farmer's property and takes a small amount of food to go home to feed his children with.  Do you believe the farmer should be able to use force against the hungry man?  Do you actually believe the farmer's right to buy more bling is so much more important than feeding the man's hungry children that you're willing to use force, perhaps even lethal force? 
Property is aggression itself.  It's a claim of right to use force to *deny* food, water, shelter and goods even to people who desperately need them to survive.

Unlike many here, I'm actually a "believer" of monetarism, and I'm not particularly libertarian. 
I follow Bitcoin because I realize that the concept of a cryptocurrency isn't just going to go away just because I think it's potentially economically destructive on a large scale.  It's here and it's here to stay, so I follow it with interest.
But, possible consequences: 
* Crippling the state's ability to control the monetary supply for boom/bust cycles, resulting in a return to the [typical 20 - 30% inflation/deflation yearly cycles]( that were normal on the gold standard.  Say what you will about monetarism, but the currency of Western nations for the last half century have generally been extremely stable.  Canada's inflation rate has varied between 1.2% and 12.50% which makes it one of the most stable, albeit slightly deflationary, periods for any currency in history.  The 150% swings in either direction over the course of 3 or 4 years are something we don't currently have to cope with. 
* It makes insurance of deposits savings difficult as nothing can ultimately prevent a bank collapse in a major bank in the event of a bank run, which would in volatile times, discourage investment.
* A tendency to hoard a deflationary currency, which would also discourage investment.
Now, I am definitely a critic of the consumerist/endless growth model of our current economic system, but a downturn affects more than just people's ability to buy the next cool gadget.  Thus: 
* I worry that we could have a vicious cycle where a downturn discourages commerce, which makes the financial markets more volatile and dangerous and people more desperate, and thus discourages even more commerce, resulting in the basic material output grinding to a halt with great hardship, much as during the Great Depression.
* The disinclination to invest in periods of turbulence could result in fundamental cashflow problems for the state in periods of downturn that would result in either harsh taxes or massive cuts, or both, which would only amplify both the economic downturn and the general hardship.

You know, one thing I haven't had explained to my satisfaction by those who object to the wealth transfer aspects of inflation is why the opposite is any more desirable or just.
The creation of money is, in effect, transfer some of the value of money held by others to those who it is created by.  In the typical low inflation model of national fiat currencies, savings are eroded over time in favour of new money issued to banks which is usually then lent out for expenditure.  It's a transfer of wealth from savers to those who are currently spending, lending and borrowing.
In a deflationary model, the opposite would occur.  As economic growth causes prices to drop, people who spend, buy non-liquid assets or borrow are penalized as there is an effective transfer of wealth from them to those who hold currency. 
Why is that any more justified?

Personally, I'm sticking with Interac.  They're a domestic nonprofit cooperative between the banks and credit unions instead of a foreign for-profit multinational.  Even better, they generally charge a flat fee for transaction rather than the flat fee + percentage cut that Visa does.

How is it fraud?  It's not like they're preying on ignorance -- every schoolchild learns how it works.  I certainly remember learning about it in high school.
Part (or even most or all) of your money isn't figuratively held in the vault but lent out, for which there is a certain risk that the bank could over-leverage and you could lose your funds.  With state currencies, the balances are usually insured to some degree to mitigate the risk, encouraging both investment and lessening the economic impact of bank failures.
You agree to all of this when you put your money in a FR bank.  I'm not sure how it's fraud when all this is out in the open.  Is loaning someone money for an investment fraud too?

While true they're known as *cryptographic* hash functions for a reason as they share similarities to encryption algorithms in design and many important security functions depend on reliable collisions in hashing algorithms not being computationally feasible (Bitcoin's proof of work function being an example, but far from the only one).
For example, it's possible to create a (hostile) executable of reasonable size that will have the same hash as an original executable by the insertion of appropriate data to produce an equivalent hash result under MD5.
As for Bitcoin, having exclusive knowledge about a reliable attack on SHA256, even if only partial, could allow someone to launch an effective 51% attack on the network.
Partial attacks on earlier algorithms have rendered them insecure.  MD4 and MD5 are both now insecure and SHA1 has flaws that will likely render it practically insecure very soon if it isn't already.

A person of course, has the right to their effort and their time.  We're agreed that it's wrong to *force* anyone to work because that is indeed slavery.
A right to the value of your labour is a very different matter though.  What, after all, determines the *value* of your labour?
A single person's labour, without equipment, knowledge, infrastructure, stability, a market and everything else, is basically nil.  
Who owns those as a whole, other than all of humanity?  If the value of your labour is (your time) x (societal productive multiplier), by what right does an individual assert ownership over the fruits of said multiplier?
Every person has an equal moral claim to produced wealth generally, because said wealth is only possible with the collective heritage of humanity.  No individual has a right to assert a claim on that.  
Indeed, to claim that all of the fruits of your effort are yours alone is tantamount to depriving everyone else of their rightful share of humanity's collective cultural, social and economic heritage.

Yes, eventually it would become blaringly obvious, but if you start moving small balances around that had been untouched for a long time, then progress and ramp it up it would be devastating. 
People wouldn't catch on immediately.  It would start with the usual "my Bitcoins disappeared, what happened?" over a few days or weeks or even months.
By the time everyone realizes what's going on, we have no clear idea how far back to rollback the blockchain.  Can you just undo the last 4 months of transactions?  Do you just accept the fraudulent transactions?  The debate over what to do will be yet more time.

@_date: 2013-09-01 03:33:34
If you ramp up hashing power, the difficulty will lag behind, meaning blocks will be created more quickly which will increase the money supply faster than intended.
In the last few months with exponential growth, the time between blocks has averaged between 5 and 8 minutes instead of the nominal 10.  As a result, we're some 10k blocks ahead of where we should be, which means there is effectively 250k BTC more than there would be otherwise.

* No easy way to handle defaults or check creditworthiness.  Generally to loan people money you need to adhere to all sorts of legal standards and they have to be in the same jurisdiction as you.  If they offer security you have to legally and practicably be able to seize it.  If it's unsecured you need to report to the credit bureaux and tank their credit rating.  How do all those work with Bitcoin?  Anybody's guess.  It certainly won't go down with the type that prefers it to be fairly anonymous. 
* A loan in BTC is risky for both given the fairly wild swings in value.  If you loan me 500 BTC today for six months and the value of BTC plummets, you've lost terribly.  If the value of BTC skyrockets, I've now got a debt I could never realistically repay.  Unless you fix the loan to a fiat currency, in which case you might as well do the loan in that currency anyway.

Canada Post (who would handle something shipped by USPS) is *much* more reasonable with their customs fees than the couriers. 
For something from the USA, if it's worth more than the duty-free limit (~$25), you should expect about $8 in customs and duty handling fees plus the appropriate sales tax for the value of the product and the shipping for your province.
[Here's a useful fees calculator.](
Edit: I should note that, *in practice*, almost every time I've ordered something from the US and had it shipped by USPS, customs didn't even open it or charge anything, it just rolled on right through.  This is mostly for small to medium sized packages valued at no more than maybe $150 though.

Bitcoins are worth real money these days.  People are about as likely to give them away as you would be to give away USD or EUR to a random person online.

Keep a copy of it in your house and in a safe deposit box at your bank. If something takes out both, you have bigger problems than your bitcoin security.

Just to nitpick, but Seaborg actually made gold atoms out of lead with nuclear transmutation back in the 1980s.

No business model just an open source utility. :)

Yeah, no.  Prison rape isn't cool, and attitudes and comments like that normalize it.  
Knock it off.

Social democrat with libertarian leanings on some social and digital issues.
I'm not sure you could call me a Bitcoin supporter.  
I do find Bitcoin to be beautiful, intellectually.  It's a stunning design that leaves me more in awe each time I consider it.
I also find aspects of Bitcoin to be deeply troubling and problematic, but I'm also interested in seeing where it goes and I don't believe banning it would be the correct answer.  Cryptocurrencies have been introduced as a concept to humanity.  You can't put the cat back in the bag.  So I'm here, watching what happens.
