huh. cool thanks. 
I almost missed the "Representative Samples" part of your comment, and I was about to say that the number of nodes looked way too low for both. 
Thanks for sharing.

well, thanks to your link, I now know that the Twitter poster arrived at his conclusion by manually counting nodes on
So, I guess that could explain how he came up with the 2% figure for Bitcoin. Still no idea where he got the figure for Bitcoin Cash though.

I've been looking for a map of bitcoin cash full nodes. But I can't find one. 
I did find a site that shows the number of reachable bitcoin nodes broken down by country. 
This says that 27.6% of nodes are in the USA &amp; 6.75% (not 2%) are in China. 
 
appears to show the total number of nodes &amp; what software they are running. But it doesn't say where they are running.
Can you share your source for Bitcoin Cash's node distribution?

Pro tip: 
Adding ' /s ' to the end of your comment has become an accepted method of conveying sarcasm on Reddit.

The problem with your point regarding cell phones is that cell phones are "goods" in economics speak. Not "money." And you can't really compare what happens with cellphones to what happens with money. Because nobody is trying to use cell phones as money &amp; if they did, they're find that cell phones as currency suffer from very rapid inflation. The more time you hold onto a cellphone before trading it the less it is worth.

Alright, I'm going to play a bit of devils advocate here. Despite my interest in bitcoin, I do not own any.  I do buy things from Amazon fairly regularly though. Why should I want to be able to use bitcoins on Amazon? How could it benefit me?

I'm just going to make a wild guess that since computer parts are usually made in SE Asia, and Australia is geographically closer to SE Asia, shipping costs are lower. In case it isn't that simple, my gut say that whatever the reason, it's due to some factors outside of a retailers control. (Trade agreements between nations, or regulations imposed by governments, that sort of thing) But that's just my gut talking.

He claims to be looking at pre-shipping price.

I keep telling myself I should buy some bitcoin, but it always looks to expensive.

I have to pay tax on Newegg purchases too, and I'm in CA. I think it might be more about your (and my) state demanding sales tax from companies that sell to residents of that state. Than it is about being located in the same state as newegg.

Bitcoin is a currency not a payment system. It should be competing with other currencies, not with other payment systems. If it succeeds in replacing other currencies, one of the casualties will be competing payment systems. But defeating other currencies will have a far bigger impact than just altering the payment systems.

Legally in the US it is considered property.  But functionally it is a currency.  And no, this would not affect whether the picture in question is in violation of DMCA or protected under fair use.

But if the discount draws enough legitimate customers to use bitcoin, he might be able to stop accepting credit cards &amp; become a bitcoin only shop. (Because his business is profitable based solely on revenue from bitcoin purchases)

you sure re-read the Wikipedia article before you post next time. Yes, you're right that the Streisand Effect says attempts suppress information on the internet often have the opposite effect. But basically every other detail in your post is wrong.

This is where the waters get muddy again. Because Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment system. And while people may own quantities of the currency, nobody owns the payment system aspect Bitcoin.  
Will the creator of this image profit directly from people using bitcoin instead of Western Union? Highly unlikely.  
Is it promoting a competing payment system? Absolutely
So, yeah I agree that it is not an open and shut case. But I'm not sure who has the stronger argument.

Alright then. Now I'm even more curious as to why the SSDs the original commenter was referring to are cheaper in Australia than they are in US. 
Any chance it was a currency conversion error that led to the claim? Edit: no definitely not that.

How many different addresses is Satoshi's 1M bitcoins spread across? Or what's the most bitcoins any single address has in it? 
Followup question: Would it be possible to estimate the point at which the value of bitcoin is high enough &amp; computing power is cheap enough that it will become economically viable to brute force crack the private key for that address? 
I know the short answer is that it's a very very long time away, but it seems like an interesting thought exercise to figure out.  Something like if the price is x &amp; there are y bitcoins at the address,  then someone could profit by using a brute force attack to steal the bitcoins. (Solve for x &amp; y)

Now that's an interesting thought. Looking at where Bitcoin is now, it's difficult and strange to imagine that the government might one day subsidize mining it. It makes sense in theory but it still sounds weird.

 &gt;Segwit plus small increase adjustable blocks 
The trouble with adjustable blocks is that all current proposals require a hardfork. I think it sounds like a reasonable compromise. But we've all seen how hard it is to get people to agree on segwit. And that's only a soft fork. So as the OP  said, it may now be impossible to get enough people to agree in order to do a successful hard fork.

Should off chain be the only option though? Or do you think that off chain will prove to be the better option when both on chain and off chain scaling are made more possible? (day to day users will choose the tools that result in off chain scaling when presented with both options)

You don't need to announce 1MB forever. 1MB is the status quo. If you don't announce plans to change the status quo, silence will effectively achieve 1MB forever with the added "benefit" of not having to defend 1MB forever, because you've never announced it as your position.

Have you read about the talk Apple's Head of Security Engineering &amp; Architecture gave at the BlackHat convention recently? 
They came up with some really clever solutions to securely storing those keys in multiple locations. But they also inadvertently blew that argument out of the water. 
I recommend you give it a read.

The Bolivar has been under a controlled exchange rate system for over 15 years.  
Some lucky people have access to the official government controlled foreign exchange rates. Those rates drastically overvalue the Bolivar compared to the black market value of the currency.

There's no doubt that bitcoin and PayPal work differently. But at the simplest level they both accomplish the same goal:  
Allowing one person to pay another person for goods or services. 
So in that regard you can compare Bitcoin and PayPal.

I think the resources the above commenter is referring to is mainly all the time they spent working for the defendant. If they aren't paid before the trial (because all the defendant's assets were frozen), the defendant loses, and everything is seized from the defendant. Then, all the months or years that the lawyers spent working on the defense was free. No paycheck. So why risk taking on the case if there is a chance you won't be paid?
