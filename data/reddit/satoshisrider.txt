Robinhood does have hidden fees though. Here is  how it works: Robinhood will say the price of Bitcoin is whatever, let's say  $11,500. Then if you go to buy, it will quote the price at $11,520 (I  don't know the percentage they use). You might think it just went up,  but they have actually tacked on a percentage. If you go to sell, you  will see $11,480 or similar. Since they so "no fees" many people just  assume "O it went up / down since when they pulled the first quote," but  that isn't the case. They are actually adding a hidden fee.

Any amount of Bitcoins / Satoshi is sufficient for the entire world. Unless 100% of the coins are lost, we are OK. We can add as many decimal points as we need.

the hashing algorithms used in Bitcoin can be changed and updated, that is one of the easier problems to fix. not yet necessary though.

\&gt;  real, viable project 
Viable projects? Sure. A team dedicated to actually seeing the project through to completion instead of just jumping to the next project as soon as they can dump their coins at a decent price? A team willing to stand up to the SEC if they get questioned and investigated? A team that will stick around through another crypto crash? No, very few coins actually have that and we both know it.  Moreso, a newbie cannot distinguish between good projects and those just focused on pumping the price and establishing liquidity until they can exit.
OP, go ahead and trade alts if you want, just know that trading fees are very high compared to traditional markets, so you are likely to overtrade and end up with less than you started with. Alts are basically a game of musical chairs with people trying not to be the last "bagholder." But certainly some alts will probably outperform Bitcoin in the short term, it is just extremely difficult to know in advance. Historically \~99% of altcoins have ended up \~$0 and many have very little liquidity. 
Good luck out there, its tough for experienced traders and even tougher for newbies. Cash app is probably the fastest way to get your hands on actual bitcoins quickly so you can trade alts.
