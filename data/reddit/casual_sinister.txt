Why does the description sound so much like me? 
But, I'm so much grateful that I've got a v supportive family who would not disown me, cuz they obviously know i had no intention in making them lose.

Don't force people to stay in this against their will. Hodlers don't add much value, it's the liquid assets which do. 
We're not seeing much movement in price everyday, and it's not unusual. Most of the Bitcoin movements happen in a matter of a few days in the whole year. If you're lucky enough to have boarded the flight before it takes off, then off you are to the moon.
And we need to boost the buy demand now for the price to go up, and for that, and that would mark the resurgence of Bitcoin.

I think it's the reverse, people start talking when price rises.

I don't know if this is unprofessional, but if I were in your shoes I would have flew to binance's office, got hold of the owner of that little shop and demand action. Who has given binance the warrant to decide what's shady, anyway? I cannot believe you have been patient with them for soo long.
