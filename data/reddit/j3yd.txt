Yes! Get a ledger nano s, then you won't have to worry about anything, come back in 10 years and you will be happy you did that. You never know coinbase could be hacked or gone bankrupt or something else by then
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:01:43
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:40:20
Bch isn't up 300%?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:53:54
Ok cheers, any help on how you calculated that on the site?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:28:46
Before you invest in litecoin and ethereum, ask yourself why. If your answer is because it seems kinda cheap, your doing it wrong
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:10:36
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:24:17
How much fiat did you put in to bitcoin, fiat ~ 500? Ish
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:55:25
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:32:13
"Few extra quid" do you mean loses few hundred quid? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:45:15
Eww coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:08:48
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:29:07
Remember with coinbase you don't own the bitcoin, at some point you want to move it to a hardware / paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:45:45
And where did you get that from....
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:32:56
No, no it does not mean that
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:06:33
Is this a question?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:57:05
Do it
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:19:01
Unlucky hope it gets fixed but I'd take out the donations bit if I was you. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:53:36
Not on my readings? 2 weeks ago bitcoin cash wasn't $1050?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:39:00
Come on, bitcoin still has technical problems we can't try and hide that
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:51:29
Need it to confirm within about 5 hours, what do you think I should set it to?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:41:35

@_date: 2017-12-27 23:56:12
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:48:02
Yeah that's a good point, my ledger nano s could do with some more Bitcoin to keep it warm y'know
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:29:47
Wow that's cool
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:27:16
**H**old **O**n ^^for **D**ear **L**ife
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:14:09
It has extra charges so you may need to send slightly less as the fees need to be included
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:37:29
Is it not recommended to store bitcoins in coinbase?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:40:36
Are you sure it's a good app? The ratings seem a bit iffy
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:08:44
Euros - dollars 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:29:32
Any options on my phone, could I use Copay?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:21:34
How would you recommend transferring bitcoins from coinbase to making them privately held? (Im from UK)
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:58:00
Ah fair enough, I think I got lucky with mine, ordered on Amazon and got the last one, 2 day delivery
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:45:26
Sure, take this offer whilst it lasts tho
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:34:47
Thanks for you help, will give that one a try!
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:03:46
How do you know that
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:38:06
Get a ledger nano s instead
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:27:02
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:23:10
Not too technical, is that simple?
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:38:16
If I was you I'd watch the market for a few days, see if there is a drop, if there is, great! Buy more, if not just send some more money in and forget about it for a while
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:25:15
The best time to buy Bitcoin was last year, but the second best time is now.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:34:20
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:23:46
How come you don't want to use coinbase?
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:21:50
I'd say an early investor, nothing too special
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:14:11
Ok good luck, Bitcoin will drop a ton if 2x is activated but don't panic
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:23:01
Ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:32:20
It's hard but just try to forget about it for a while, your $50 isn't going to $500 anytime soon but it equally isn't going to $5 so nothing massive is going to happen when your away.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:20:20
So interesting, so in like 100 years people will trust it much more which leads it to be more stable
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:18:28
Wow that works nicely thanks
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:21:34
You should really think about getting a trezor or ledger with that amount of money in there
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:17:56
So people need to be buying bitcoins often, like a lot of people put like 10% in after payday
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:04:28
Sorry meant GBP, I'm trying blockfolio but not sure how to get it to work, I'm "Adding a coin" then put in the amount etc. Then press save and then I don't know where it went
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:01:30
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:16:59
Aren't they expensive?
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:05:18
Yeh and then a guy put another 50 in
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:45:20
You aren't always making money but there is a lot of different ways to invest, there is day trading where you tend to have sold everything by the end of the day but Bitcoin is more of a long term investment for most of us so maybe in a couple years we will come back and cash out. But the dream for Bitcoin is that we will never cash out, because we will never need to cash out as Bitcoin becomes more and more accepted and we can use it to buy things everywhere
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:14:35
It's making people money... Which ends in an infinite loop of profit?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:28:27
130GB storage?
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:16:04
!remindme 1 year
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:01:21
2x is something that is going to be implemented but I'm not the best person to talk to about it, but when they activate it there is going to be a pretty big drop, do some research on it
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:23:10
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:17:00
Aren't they expensive?
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:55:50
However much you can be prepared to lose
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:49:05
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:36:02
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:25:30
1. It gets you nervous if the price is heading down 
2. It avoids panic selling when prices aren't looking great
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:27:05
If you can the best time to check is next year. But in reality that's not going to happen so try not to check any more than once a day. Once a week is fine
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:24:47
The supply statement is quite incorrect
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:46:45
Slightly off you take it down to the basics bit you would need a big change in the euro or usd for any really profits. It's very different with crypto
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:31:15
Just don't bother, learn about the market and Bitcoin a bit more, day trading isn't as easy as it looks and then fee's destroy you even IF you end up making a small profit. It's just safer to HODL, gl
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:14:26
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:45:13
B2x was cancelled
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:30:24
What's the price at?
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:45:20
Well there is a lot of Bitcoin coming into the market every single day, I don't have an exact figure but I know it is a lot per day
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:48:43
You're lucky, try replicate that over and over
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:37:07
Sorry can't help you with that never heard of helix grams, I advise a ledger though
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:30:17
Yes, worst case scenario you get them back in your wallet
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:18:55
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:26:16
That's what my crystal ball says aswell
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:03:36

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:19:47

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:26
Sorry use "AS screen recorder" - the name is "AS screen recorder"
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:29:36
Wait are you serious?
Mine must me malfunctioning because it says 4:38 smh
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:17:54
The percentage is irrelevant
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:10:01
Bitcoin cash? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:15:14
Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:52:18
What's that?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:55:24
But no one got that for free?
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:38:10
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:29:37
Get a ledger nano s, now.

Never tell people the amount of Bitcoin you have
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:38:13
Lykke is a good option
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:00:01
Not as anonymous as you may think
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:01:19
Ok I have 99 Bitcoin btw phew /s
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:42:18
How much did you get?
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:06:29
Since the senator one became one of reddits top posts ever
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:57:17
Ok what's your address
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:59:37
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:41:49
Haha I'm not op
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:17:46
Are you from the UK?
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:41:11
Go to r/all then filter top/all time
Edit: The Senate. Upvote this so that people see it when they Google "The Senate".
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:18:37
Use Lyyke
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:32:49

@_date: 2017-10-18 18:51:23
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:11:42
Where are you from
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:07:30
No need to downvote if you don't understand. The basic concept is that when someone Google's "Money" Bitcoin will show up if this is upvoted lots of times. It's more of a joke and is very unlikely to happen but the goal is to type in: Money and Bitcoin popping up
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:04:45
You can't withdraw money from coinbase if you're from the UK, your best option right now is Lyyke
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:35:20
Good point but since the reply was meant to go to OP (me) anyway I got the message just fine but I appreciate the help
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:46:55
Hey what's the time?
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:49:02
Hey how did you use segwit on the nano s?
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:16:27
Is it any good for selling?
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:30:12
No you don't
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:28:51
Don't go all in, do how much you are willing to lose, no more
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:55:08
Redditor for 2 days... Hmmm
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:35:38
Wow this is getting into my head, should I listen to this guy or not
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:56:20
How much we talking?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:42:14
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:26:38
Yes it can mean that but it just came off of the miss spelling
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:50:09
And after 200k no? Nah if it gets to 200k we are going higher
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:30:54
Only in the US :(
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:36:50
Anywhere from 0.4 Bitcoin to 0.03 Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:24:34
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:55:29
Don't store that much on coinbase! Get a wallet, 2FA is good but doesn't stop coinbase from taking your coins
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:03:16
People are getting rid of their coins off places like coinbase for the fork which don't use segwit
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:17:48
Pffft and that Amazon organisation she bought
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:50:32
Nope didn't say it would change your life but I get you
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:08:21
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:23:00
All good
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:24:57
What do you mean by splitting your coins (I have a ledger)
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:44:50
I don't think it will be needed, correct me if I'm wrong but 1btc will have to be $100,000 before 1 satoshi = 1 cent
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:00:18
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:47:14
Mhm I can tell... It hasn't been that long though only a few weeks ago haha
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:31:45
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:31:47
What's the problem with 2 of the same words?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:40:23
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:55:49
They will last way longer
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:39:20
Don't worry about it, it will probably get confirmed soon but if you set the fee too low the worst that will happen is that you will just get the coins back. It will take some time
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:17:37
An app
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:12:17
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:16:01
So 59k is too small? Any amount of money in bitcoin is worth it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:39:48
$10k in 3 days is possible
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:00:11
Wait till the fork
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:21:54
Sorry dude, eli5 only, no younger
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:50:31
Go for it then! I would say put half in now and half in after the fork. Remember to HODL and not panic sell, enjoy the ride my friend
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:19:21
Drop me a pm next time you try to buy
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:56:14
My ledger could do with some more coin to keep it company for a while

@_date: 2017-10-20 21:30:22
Don't do that!

Just do the opposite then
