Are you saying terms like "moon", "lambo" and "Hodl"
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:03:16
Well a lot of those places set really high min withdrawals so you might want to test that out to see if it's really a scam.
400 bucks? I think it's possible to get the basics and maybe a 1050ti. You'd probably have to get everything used if you can even find a 1050ti at MSRP or below. can probably help you out too.
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:51:04
100 bucks an hour? You're being scammed...You need to-do more research before you invest.

Would like an explanation too.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:31:58
That's a penny. You need to either spend some real money or try mining alts for BTC. Those phone miners are not worth your time and who knows what they contain in them.

Yeah, but I think people who don't own bitcoin would find it kind of suspicious. I assume if it is one person they didn't expect it to get so large and just went anonymous.

Depends what coin you want. When it comes to BTC I use cold storage.

This is true, I think I remember someone saying they convert it as soon as they get it.

They probably meant mining on a GPU is a waste for BTC, but you can mine other coins to convert into BTC. Like hope that helps.
