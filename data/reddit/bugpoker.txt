Maybe not though. The USMS could have decided not to sell period if they didn't get a nice enough bid.

The BeeBOMB is amazing. I have to order more as I went through my two bottles super quick putting it on everything. Keep it up!

Well taking the site down randomly would have been a huge red flag that something was up. If he was under a gag order it's possible they were investigating activity that they wanted to continue. Shutting down the site would interfere with that.

Mtgox wasn't anonymous...basically there's no way to know exactly which exchanges will fail. We can't regulate but can only inform users so that they can make educated choices. There's good reasons for running services anonymously as well.

They're probably including their processing time in there.

Sure it does. If he violates a gag order anywhere with an extradition treaty with the US then he faces the consequences.  Location does not matter with a gag order.

Yea I know.  I meant through overstock cars.

In regards to  I'm wondering what legal action could be taken against someone for this. I have a feeling it would be pretty hard to get local law enforcement to take action.

I didn't even click the link but don't most stores already have digital prices? Markets around here have little displays with pricing. Like this:

My point is that it should be cost effective because it has already been done for other currencies.

Do they normally release auction numbers?

Should be giving the real website traffic rather than coindesk blog spam.

Misleading title as it's just a theory. It's a good theory but it's not fact yet.

Why does it matter? We're talking bitcoin as a whole. Bitcoin allows people to be their own banks. To hold value in a wallet instead of having to store value in a physical currency or item. It doesn't matter who has them now, people will trade for them.
Bitcoin is revolutionary because it allows people to store value infinitely safer. The 500 million people are spoiled by institutions that secure and insure our money, allowing us to save for a "rainy day". People without access to banking did not have that option until bitcoin.

I've been waiting for my iPhone 4 to die to make the switch but it's just not happening in time. I'm thinking of switching soon because of their stance on BTC and the inconvenience it causes.

Bitcoin services are available with SMS so I think the term smart phone is very broad.
