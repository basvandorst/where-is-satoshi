I bought at ~ 750$ (530€ to be more clear, via bitcoin.de)
Since that i've been trading DOGE and other Alts with the money. Since DOGE tanked during this year, i'm 25% lower in total BTC value PLUS the loss from BTC beeing worth now only 500$. 
But i dont regret anything yet ;-) I'm still long in DOGE and i'm quite sure Bitcoin will rise again. In the meantime i'm using small amounts of both to purchase coffee in a store next door (I'm living in Berlin)

i could not resist and had to buy two BTC, even though the price might drop further. This is nevertheless MUCH cheaper then my last BTCs several months ago :)

Well bitcoin is a currency, and investing in currencies can be profitable. But the steategy should be different to stocks.

nice, i wanted to buy in at  ~270€ last friday, now the price is there in $ and maybe it'll be even less.

I'm not sure about this, since i'm german, but we have an quite similar law here. Problem will be, that as long as the insolvency is going on (=some japanese attorney liquitating Mt.Gox, it's assetts, etc.), the "loss" someone has is only valid and deductible AFTER the insolvency-case is closed.
Because, as long as the insolvency is going on, there might be a chance to recieve your money/coins back. I got several k€ still missing from the insolvency of my former employer, until now, i can only wait until the last chair/desk/coffee machine is sold..

I bought 2 BTC at 530€ same days before the MtGox fiasko.
Since then i barely managed to equal the loss of the BTC by daytrading (mainly DOGE). Now i'm waiting for BTC to raise again, so that in the end i can exit with a plus..

Is that toilet paper? This would totally add a nice cynical touch to this post :)
