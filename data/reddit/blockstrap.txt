By far the best Bitcoin song ever made!
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:21:08

Hey The course is a complete introduction to blockchain tech - we cover everything from the genesis block all the way up to current altcoins - and of course all the technical bits in between. After teaching developers about the blockchain and how it works, we spend the last hour showing them how to get started with their new-found knowledge using our stack if they'd like to create their own project. It's all free an optional and we'd love to see you if you're in town!
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:08:03
We're hoping to put the course online for everyone afterwards. We may even look at streaming one of the workshops too.

@_date: 2015-06-16 18:10:18
Good spot! We created these pages sitting in South East Asia, so why it goes to CST I have no idea.

Hey guys. Shameless plug but if you like the additional entropy that salts bring you can always check out our [deterministic wallet]( Web wallets can be extremely safe if you know how to use them :)

It's a bit fugly, but we have an open source block explorer at [ Our code is on GitHub and we're open to ideas on improving it.

If you're in the south and Prague isn't too far of a journey for you, there is a great one built by General Bytes at a place called Paralelni Polis.
