You will still have initial fees to connect to the channel. And you already know if a network will rely on a heavily used node, the node owner could increase the channel fees. 
And how will these "big" channels ever come back to the mainchain? Closing those channels to create consensus on the mainchain would cripple parts of the LN network.

300 btc into dogecoin why not? no risk no fun
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:41
You are right. And if someone who invested in BTC would be true to himself its wrong to sell and invest in fiat.. but then there are people who dont see this, they dont think outside the box. They are just here for some profits...
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:47:48
Thats how i like it. Bitcoin steady and quite while alts pumping! GOOD

How do you imagine the transition from a fiat to a crypto currency? Thats how it goes...
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:34:36
This is getting very interesting. Let us think through this.
The bubble doesn't have to burst immediately if there are no more people to jump in. The bubble bursts when 
1. people begin to sale but no one wants it! This is the main point here. Price is regulated after supply and demand. When people sale there have to be other parties that buy, certainly for a lower price, which makes the price go down. There are different cases why people would sale. A huge point here is, that people cant really do something with bitcoin itself, which leads us to our second point
2. people dont have any use case for bitcoin which will be most unlikely, since its the most established crypto currency which leads us to our third point. In my future scenario bitcoin is the gold and payment cryptos are the fiats if you relate to todays relations. 
3. another coin will win over Bitcoin as storage of value for whatever reason. Why should this happen? Forks try to do this and there is no doubt bitcoin cash is technically more advanced the bitcoin but people dont care since they all believe Bitcoin is THE thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:31:21
You should put all your money into Bitcoin. Lay a bit to the side so you have money for food.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:22:22
Sell everything you have to buy BTC. Wait 5 years. Buy everything you want back
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:31
haha like that
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:32
I like this one
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:49:51
Maybe naive but maybe right, who knows what will happen. Maybe BTC at 500k in 5 years and can be transferred to other cryptos to do transactions and to do other things, if this will happen we are in the transition already.
Your argument is to say people are not adopting BTC because of the use case, so my argument is that the use case you describe does not matter...
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:38:07
No one is saying that, right! But who is saying I'm moving my assets to gold and use it to pay at Wallmart? What other use cases are there for gold?! Ok you can make nice jewelery thats it... Bitcoins use cases are so much better. Investing in technologies speaking of ICO's etc.
AND Bitcoin isn't meant to be the payment currency. It was, but we all agree there are far more conveniert currencies to do transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:16:09
IOTA has
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:04:54
Dont forget tu install a wallet and send the coins from your exchange wallet to your private wallet
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:43:55
At the end no one knows what will happen. Believe in BTC and invest, otherwise you wont have the perseverance to hodl. If you dont believe, leave it... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:03
sell your house
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:00:07
Bitcoin isn't meant to be used to do transactions. It was but it isnt anymore. There are other cryptos that are far more convenient for the usage of exchanging value. Bitcoin has become the mother of all cryptos and so for the storage of value,... if this does make any scence?!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:37:10
I highly recommend to look into some bitcoin getting started videos on youtube. 
So Lets say you get the exodus wallet. You can google that..
Storing you're BTC on an exchange (the website where you buy your coins) is not safe. The exchange could be hacked or one day your coins are just gone and no one knows why and no one will help you with that. So you send the coins from the exchange to your own wallet (downloaded exodus wallet). If the BTC crashes now you need to send back the BTC to an exchange and sell it there for $ or whatever currency you use. This takes some time and does not work instantly. Transactions from one wallet to another take around 40-60mins with BTC.. thats my experience. 
Welcome to the crypto world
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:41:51
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:10:57
Can Bitcoin still crash or are there too many people that buy on dips to support BTC?!
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:36:50
Invested 10k€ loan in August. 60k up. Tell me more about how stupid and risky this all is. That’s how life works. People always tell you don’t do that, don’t try this. Do what you want and believe in! 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:30:55
Very intense 3 minutes as the last months!
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:13:35
So I clearly saw ETP as high potential coin at 3$ and i went all in with 600€.
Now its 6$. I would have doubled the 10k in one week. I wouldnt have gone all in with 10k probably but thats what im thinking of...
Is it that easy?
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:22:02
Depends on your lifestyle. A indonesian would be fkn rich!.. but yeaa, i get you
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:57:27
Cmon, some confidence pls. what if BTC goes up to 500k in 5-10 years?
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:21:28
Damn dude, you'll get over it. Life is a roller coaster. There will be good times again. Dont take everything so serious!
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:02:19
I see.. I can afford the payments and still live normally. 
I guess i would rather invest this money than i would trade. I think i have a good hand and Im making profit with ETP right now. This was so fkn easy and I dont see why it shouldnt be in the future? I feel crypto is space to make easy money with. I have the fear that in one year i will say to myself "damn dude it was so obvious that the cryptos will raise. You could have gotten free ca$h".. Even if I just buy BTC and hold it..
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:36:46

BTC will never be 100$ again..
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:49:30
Why not?
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:58:58
I use electrum wallet yes. Its good and seems to be secure. Havent heard anything bad.
Im not to deep into wallets tho.. not an expert
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:11:51
no other debts
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:11:24
10k, 2 months later you are at?
The money will be there, i know it.
I guess I would put 60-80% into BTC/ETH
and the rest into Alts for trading eg. ETP right now.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:57:13
another fork?
