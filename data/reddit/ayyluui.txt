You are just reading headlines, that's your problem.

What? You are retarded. Why wouldn't he buy at these prices if he did his research? Why are you calling people names without knowing anything meaningful about them? Do you know exactly when the bottom is in? Why aren't YOU a dumbass once you buy back in again? (I assume you don't believe a lot in the technology, I assume you are not a creator and you're  just tagging along, am I right? Call me retarded if I'm wrong.)
You see, I called you 'retarded' there, because of 2 reasons:
1. You call other people dumbasses because they buy an asset that crashed around 85% in value and that looks like companies are slowly but surely adopting it
2. You imply that his dad thinks "it must go back up .. because we are so low, so I'm gonna buy!!". Where do you get that information from? 
Get the fuck out of here kid, nobody likes party poopers.

Do you not have an exchange like kraken in the US? 
I send my money at 9 a.m. and it arrives at around 16 p.m. on kraken. Granted, the prices are a bit higher than on other exchanges, but nowhere near that stupidly high fee you just paid on coinbase.
If coinbase is really the best way for you to buy cryptos.. well shit, guess we aren't ready for mainstream yet.

Thanks for typing all of this, so I don't have to waste my time on those people.
Community service right there. Won't change a damn thing however, stupid people can't be told that they are stupid. If you call anybody stupid, someone else automatically assumes you as the stupid one.
This gets even more meta when I tell you that I think I'm stupid and that I also believe that only people of a certain intelligence are able to fully comprehend how stupid they really are.
