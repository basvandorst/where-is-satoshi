Fair game, but in bankruptcy court they stand less chance of success as assets are usually mingled to pay creditors.
At least a judge would rule it out and not bfx admins!

Bitfinex is ultimately responsible for the BTC loss.
Bitfinex is currently insolvent, barring new btc capital. If they are trying to pass this deficit to individual accounts,I'l lawyer up for an injunction to prevent trading and freeze all their bank accounts.
Clients entrusted USD/other non-affected assets to Bitfinex. your deposits become liabilities the moment you deposited in bfx. Socialized losses across all asset class as would in a bankruptcy court.
PS: I have $1.2 million (usd/btc/alts) at BFX

You are in the same basket of Creditors as Btc Holders . BFX is technically insolvent.
You entrusted your USD to a company that omitted to protect one of its assets as you say! Your deposits become liabilities the moment you handled it to Bfx. 
Equal treatment is what a bankruptcy court would do.
Lenders of USD will definitely take a haircut, i can tell you that. As btc collateral were stolen!

Follow the money, USD is located in Hong Kong Banks. File there to block funds in their bank accounts.

Who ever has a substantial BTC balance or Lent USD/Btc tied in Bitfinex, PM me, we are forming a group of interest with interesting information.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:30:04
The traders that you loaned your USD to maybe insolvent as their Btc collateral were stolen. As they won't have enough to cover th, Who will reimburse your loan?  Answer that..
so you earn the high APR interests but dont accept the risks...!

Bitfinex operates under a Hong Kong corporation, Renrenbee Limited (holder of the MSO license), which is wholly owned by a BVI corporation, iFinex Ltd. (our holding company).

Top comment in this sub is a great example of how bitcoin news blogs manipulate their followers to believe bitcoin is bigger than it is. And now because of their lie the name "Visa" will be dropped during every bitcoin elevator pitch just like NASDAQ and Microsoft, even though none of the above are using bitcoin in any way.
**If anyone actually cares about the truth:**
Until 30 days ago, Visa Europe was NOT even a Visa company. It was purchased by Visa on Nov 25. Visa Collab is a startup competition sponsored by Visa Europe which asks up and coming tech startups to take an idea and make it a proof of concept in 100 days. They do not give the startups money, and they do not endorse them. They merely invest in the winner of the competition.
Epiphyte is one of many competitors in this competition. Their VC comes from the usual suspect (the Drapers). They are in no way affiliated with Visa. At all. They are participating in a startup competition which is sponsored by a subsidiary of Visa.
But as you can see the bitcoin blogs have completely spun this news as Visa directly investing in bitcoin tech, which obviously couldn't be further from the truth. But just like political attack ads in reverse, now bitcoiners will be associating bitcoin with Visa even though it's patently false. And that's how bitcoiners are manipulated on a daily basis with what essentially amounts to non-news.

Yea rite! folks are going to buy more btc at 600 when Goxxers bought plenty between 100-300.. The price would plunge if this news is true. Increase in coin supply against an anemic 12million bid sum!
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:09:46
FALSE. Proof is LTC which was not on Gox but exploded ten times more than BTC. Its all Greed and speculation. Its a cycle, weak hands are telling how its over now and sold at all-time-low. Buy High sell Low. Boom to follow after Bust.

**The benefits**: more people may eventually gain access to financial services, many of them traditionally excluded from their country’s financial system. Financial inclusion, in other words. Also, the distributed ledger technologies underlying virtual currencies have applications that go well beyond money and payments, and hold the promise of big gains in efficiency for many types of financial business.
**The risks**: people using virtual currencies for money laundering, terrorist financing, as well as fraud, tax evasion, getting around capital controls, and people not understanding the risks they’ve taken on.
**The solution**: regulations that limit the risks and encourage innovation. Still, a lot of work remains to be done to find the right approaches and the right balance.
