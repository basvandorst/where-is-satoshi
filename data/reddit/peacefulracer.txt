and the forums still work. Everything except the homepage loads. The 'my account page' gets kinda screwy upon logging in.  It really just seems like they are doing updates/maintenance.

that streamtip website is pretty minimal with interface but does exactly like you mentioned. lets people leave a name and message like normal donations (it just feels more natural still doing the whole click a link and pay via that link, at least for me) I will be checking out your stream, thanks for the input :)

The donation link on MaSsanSC's page is a link to steamtip.com.
That is where the option to donate in bitcoin is. 
Not sure why he doesn't advertise it on his page, I was only the guy who asked him to start accepting.

I wish you luck on your presentation. Bitcoin can always use more big-money players :)
Sorry I can't answer any of your questions.

Please do this. You have my support. 
Idea : Just make it a general bitcoin commercial, advertising multiple bitcoin websites/affiliates and focus on validating the legitimacy.

Awesome information, I have never heard this before. Thank you circuitloss!

six figures is a heavy investment. I must admit however, (I may be crazy for thinking this) if I had 1M$USD I would invest atleast 100k$USD into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:29:45
awesome, thank you!

not that I am aware of yet. If I figure one out I will post it on reddit :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:19:53
Seems like half of reddit is ass-backwards. Sell off low and buy high? LOL
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:33:16
if it reaches 400$ we are going to see major buy orders happen. Don't expect it to go lower than that.

I am wondering the same thing. Also, wondering would it be wiser to invest in mining equipment or bitcoin?

"Is this like when I explain cryptographic functions to people and their eyes glaze over?" 
I know this feeling...

You actually can buy RP from Riot right now with bitcoin.
It is a pretty simple process involving Gyft and openbucks. 
Step 1. Go on Gyft - get a CVS pharmacy gift card, pay in bitcoin.
Step 2. Log-in to your league of legends account - Go to store, and click 'Purchase RP" - Click on the 'cash and gift card using OpenBucks ' option then follow the steps there.
Source : someone posted it on this subreddit a few weeks ago.

'It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context.  WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.' 
^ Could this be an indicator to what may have happened?
Thank you op for the link, great find!

I somewhat agree with you. We see all these major US companies speculating on accepting btc as payments and we see very little to no raise in btc value, yet the slightest bad news from China influences massive sell-offs which knock us down 20-30%. If China was out of the picture, I think the rest of the world would start seeing stability in bitcoin value.
