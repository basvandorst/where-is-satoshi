[Crowdfundinsider.com]( article confirms partnership with Blockstream, so probably yes.

I'm in agreement with you regarding the timeline to a strong bull market.  BTC historically does a slow upward climb before going parabolic.

Misleading title.  **Goldman is NOT out**.  They're reprioritizing custody solutions above trading.

That's right.  But this account, despite numerous requests, won't offer a source.  Thought someone here at reddit would.

Link doesn't work.  Retail banks issue more dollars in credit than there are dollars to back the paper money.  Investment banks issue more in credit on securities than there are securities to back the derivatives.  Bitcoins 21 M cap + creates a deflationary banking system that is best in breed even now.

This proves peer-to-peer, permissionless exchange of value at the institutional level is reliable and possible.  It's social proof for other institutional money.  Get your funds ready.

True that.  Most people have no clue what money is.  How the properties of fungibility, durability, divisibility, and portability contribute to success of Stores of Value.  
Imagine a barter community that discovered that garlic lasted for 6 months without going bad?  It's thus "durable" and portable.  Imagine the bubble rise in the value of garlic in local communities when people discovered garlic's two money properties (portable, "durable")?  Suddenly people would try to corner the "garlic" market like the Hunt brothers tried to corner the Silver market.
Others don't understand "demand" for money is what protects it's buying power.  So in 10-30 years when the $USD loses it's status as the primary global reserve currency, demand for the $USD will decrease.  And so will everyone's purchasing power who made the mistake of measuring their wealth in $USD only.

The history is everywhere.  Phoenicians, Mesopotamians regularly bartered with foreign tribes in cities across oceans. 
It’s especially evident when strangers did business with one another.

Of course it will have market cycles.  It's a series of bubbles so far.  It survives to new All Time High's every time.
Bitcoin, like other currencies (sea shells, Isle of Yap Limestone) began as a *collectible*.
To go from something worth nothing to something worth a lot, it has to go through periods of volatility.  Eventually it will transition to *Store of Value*.  This will be aided by bitcoin backed institutional products (Bakkt, Eris X, Fidelity, Ivy League Endowments, etc)
Then it will transition to *Medium of Exchange*.
And finally graduate to a *Unit of Account*.

It was a collectible for anarchists, cypherpunks, and nerds.  Sea Shells (Americas), limestone (Yap), cigarettes (prison), glass beads (Africa), and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to standards of money.  Scarcity, resistance to corrosion, difficulty to resource and other unique properties first made them collectibles.  This is the same path btc started with.  
You are incorrect in your analysis of the monetary evolution of btc.

If we follow the 2015 capitulation pattern, we'll have another bounce downwards to 1.8-2.2K.  Probably around late Feb/March if the same fractal pattern applies.
