I just bought one yesterday as well. Don't know how much I will be using it (or even initially trusting it until some months has passed), but I wanted to support the development, and I'm also just extremely interested/curious about the device. Good up the good work! :)

Yeah please provide source. Although it completely sound like something T. Mayer would say, I've been on the internet long enough to be skeptical of [any quote without reference.](

Bitcoin will not end wars. Changing currency doesn't change human nature. We will have to evolve.

Then we might strongly disagree.
I disagree with part of the method by which the government is making money; inflation by moneyprinting, but at least they are spending it on the collevtive good (ideally - it works a little better in some countries than in others).
Pure capitalistic speculation whereby stocks and currency are being traded and sold quickly and for profit, is ultimately immoral. Somebody has to do real work for others to profit from nothing else than rapidly pushing and pulling their virtual assets to/from stocks and currencies. Money should be a pure representation of the usable amount of work one has performed for others.
We have a saying in danish for that, which has hard to translate, but is roughly: "The smart fools the less smart". Modern banking and capitalism has it's clear virtues, but in the way it's practiced today it's really just a sophistication of the primitive jungle law "The physically strong dominates the physically weak".
Let me be clear about one thing: I believe in equal opportunity, not equal outcome. If you are able to recognize good ideas (as modern successful entrepreneurs) then of course you should be rewarded and have gain higher credibility as a future decisionmaker and further get rewarded for that. In the current system there is no legal distinction between investment and immoral speculation. I'm not saying I have a clear idea of how the more ideal system would be designed/executed, but I'm feel confident that in time it will become possible with technology - just as Bitcoin pushed the boundaries.

That's only partially true in my opinion. Human have plenty of animalistic traits left, but we have also developed humanistic traits far more than any animals. Traits like a sense of justice, idea of universal human rights, altroism etc.
Lots of other bad shit is in our nature, that doesn't mean it's good.
Regartdless, this discussion doesn't change the fact that it's completely naive to think that bitcoin adoption would end wars.

I don't think so?
Password recovery in many implementations means that an administrator have the capability to request a *password reset* that will email a secure link to your email so you can select a new one. For that the administrator will not need any private encryption key.
@_date: 2014-04-24 14:03:58
Using Incognito mode for all bitcoin related stuff seems appropriate.
Tip: Use LastPass to store your passwords, and allow this as the only extension in Incognito mode.
Using LastPass will also increase your general level of security because you won't be re-using passwords anywhere.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:40:38
No, in many cases the sys admin *will not* have access to your password in clear text. He will only be able to send a link with a password reset link to your registered email.
All the admin does is keep an encrypted version of your password on his servers and your registered email address in clear text as the option of resetting password. The original password can never be recovered if lost.

Nothing, Bitcoin is truly breaking the world of aribitrary borders and regulations, which is good. I'm just saying it's too bad that is does little about the extreme economic inequality in the world - actually depending on how it Bitcoin plays out in the next few years / decade, it could be even worse - or better. See Auroracoin, I love that citizens of Iceland starts out on equal ground at least.
I guess it's too much to ask Bitcoin to solve all the problems at once, and I acknowlege that Bitcoin is at least giving complete financial freedom, lower fees and new opportunities.
I must acknowledge that capitalism/free market ideas helped enormously many people out of poverty, I guess I'm just saying that one of the greatest one great problem with modern economics/capitalism, in my opinion, is that the system can be played to earn money for no real valuable work. Bitcoin does nothing for that. It may takes decades, even more than 100 years or more, but I hope that this fundamental problem can be solved by technology at some point. However Bitcoin is indeed a big step in the right direction. Lots of innovation is definetely still to come.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:22:00
Yeah you're probably right. I'll probably start using it pretty quickly, I just thought I'd wait a little to see if anyone discovered a critical security flaw. But I forgot that the Trezor actually has already had a beta stage for about a year right?
I guess I'll split my cold storage 50/50 between my usual offline linux machine and the Trezor. But having all my eggs in any basket would make me uneasy :)

The real problem is that Bitstamp does not provide a raw seed code or paper key / set of keys as a backup in case of broken/stolen/lost phone. Everybody else with 2 step verification does this: Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote, Microsoft, Coinbase, Kraken etc.
Bitstamp needs to get off their asses and do this. It would also save them a hell of a lot of support time.

It's satire. It's a piss-take on the subreddit. And it's funny. But I guess if you have no humor...

The current capitalistic inflationary fractional-reserving fiat currency system used in most of the world today can be analyzed and discussed in terms of the ethics and fairness of the system and the behavior it encourages.
Similarly the fundamental design of the Bitcoin system of generating and transferring wealth and the ethics of it and the behavior it encourgaes can be discussed.
Broad concepts things like science, writing and technology is inherently neutral. But a specific money system and it's merits and demerits is a fully valid discussion.
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:44:02
We agree, I think it's just the reaction I get sometimes when Bitcoin is uncritically praised to the heavens. Overall I'm a pretty big fan of Bitcoin.
There are aspects of it I hope can be somehow rectified in future innovation, but it's definitely a big step in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:12:26
Yes but you refer to an android app, so it is generated electronically (as it must be), regardless of whether you choose to write it down on paper afterwards?
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:59:27
Why not?
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:34:34
I'm all for Bitcoibn, but I wouldn't invest more than 50% of my savings. Probably closer to 10-20% depending on absolute value.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:40:54
Huh, interesting :)
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:24:37
Ok, and by scan the private key you mean a QR code? If this ends up in the phone memory for any time, how is this safe?
Thank you for your patience with me :)
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:24:15
But unfortunately it will be very unevenly distributed.
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:33:03
You're welcome. Sorry if I came off as a little harsh :)

What a load of bullshit, and what a negative and foolish message to spread.
By all means, donate to Wikipedia! I have done so multiple times myself and will do it again.
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:14:00
thanks for the tip

How can an online android device be considered a cold wallet?
@_date: 2014-07-16 00:31:00
using what service?
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:17:26
Ok. How is it possible to spend money from the cold wallet account without having to input the private key every time? Wouldn't that involve the private key one- or multiple times having to be typed into the android device one way or the other?
