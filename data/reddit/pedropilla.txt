Ok, the block concept I get it, but imagine if theres no transactions in the next BTC block, the block is going to be created no matter if theres transactions, and in the next 10min another block pops?

Maybe they can rise a thousand nodes in AWS, or something crazy like that, who knows, $ is $ right? I think if the hash moves to BTC1 like that the price will have the biggest dip ever, but like we're talking it's only temporary because the altcoiners will see the big oportunity flowering, money talking is money talking and bitcoin will remain bitcoin, btc1 will be btc1 not bitcoin.

Yeah I think it would be exactly like you're saying, the minority of miners that don't have the power to compete in BTC mining will point their eqps to BTC. Maybe we're going to have the best entry point in this mess, because all the FUD but after this 'stall' I think we're going to the moon.
And about security? The 51% attack is a big concern in this case?

I dont get it, an empty block without transactions to validate and the reward is unspendable. Looks like the old question about the chicken and the egg.

even with a hardware wallet, do you now exactly what components are integrated in the chip? and what they do? and what flaws they have? i think a offline linux amd it is the best solution

I think IF the hodler gives back the coins to you, he can keep 2 or 3 coins right? Maybe you offering these coins you get lucky.

People are familiarized with banks holding their money, they are just ordinary people keeping their old habits in a new world, sad
