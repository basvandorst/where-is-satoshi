Hey r-eddi-t2 :)
Yeah it does. Look at the chart here of the price: 
It's miner revenue of 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes divided by number of transactions. We are collectively paying for this cost through coin dilution.

Hey whazfan69,
The thing with inflation in the dollar is that this seigniorage is accrued by the Federal Reserve (assuming the money multiplier stays constant). By this I mean that the Federal Reserve buys US Gov debt on which we as tax payers don't have to pay interest as long as it's held by the Federal Reserve. In effect the money goes to "we the people" as opposed to being burned on energy.
There are many reason why the Fed targets a 3% inflation rate every year. The most important one is that if you have an expectation that your money will be worth 3% less every year, you have a positive time value of money. This will cause you to undertake capital projects that you might have otherwise not undertaken. In short, your equilibrium state is biased towards spending and investing now rather than later. 
Having deflation is bad because the equilibrium state is to hoard the currency. This happened in Japan and was a primary cause of the "lost decade". Shinzo Abe is trying his best to get inflation going again and the results are evident in the equity markets as well as the rally in JGB yields.

I think it's very important to make Bitcoin simpler to use for the mainstream. By that I mean making it easier to understand and abstracting away all the private key/public key things. It will be very difficult to cross the chasm to mainstream without simplifying it more. QuickCoin was one of the examples where they use your facebook unique id to secure your wallet. I'm sure there will be more development on that front

But the thing is that real transaction costs ex subsidy really are around $35 if you check [blockchain.info]( If the subsidy starts getting cut, we would need to foot the bill in order to have the same amount of security.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:23:40
Well it depends how you think about it. If we have zero trust in a centralized system, we will sadly need to take this cost to secure a network that is decentralized. It's much more costly to run a decentralized network than a centralized network. For example you have to copy each transaction over and over again millions of times as opposed to 3 times for our current system.
It's a very strong "power to the people" system but we shouldn't be deluded that it's actually cheaper.
The real advantage of bitcoin is that we built a decentralized network of trust which is a fascinating development. We also solved the double spending problem for any digital asset. For example I can give you a movie, music file, stock, or virtual car keys and be prevented from "double spending that".
In terms of food for thought, imagine the end game for the miners. Everyone will converge in larger and larger pools that are geographically located around the cheapest energy sources in the world. GHash is a prime example of how Bitcoin does have centralization tendencies.

In that case I will rely on the 1% chance that you think I have for not having been paid to put this out there. I have no association whatsoever with these guys. I just thought it was a cool video. Of course there are more than 10 facts about Bitcoin and some are more important than others. The vast majority of dollars out there are also intangible and just bits in our bank accounts so yes I fully agree with you. And man, to be frank, if they paid someone, they wouldn't pay someone that just joined reddit and has 9 link karma. That would just be a bad investment for them =D

However the substance of the question is "would they be able to do anything like this without government endorsement?". The answer is no. Below is the Wikipedia description:
The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service sets policy, procedure, and postal rates for services rendered, and has a similar role to a corporate board of directors. Of the eleven members of the Board, nine are appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate (see 39 U.S.C. § 202). The nine appointed members then select the United States Postmaster General, who serves as the board's tenth member, and who oversees the day-to-day activities of the service as Chief Executive Officer (see 39 U.S.C. §§ 202–203). The ten-member board then nominates a Deputy Postmaster General, who acts as Chief Operating Officer, to the eleventh and last remaining open seat.
The independent Postal Regulatory Commission (formerly the Postal Rate Commission) is also controlled by appointees of the President confirmed by the Senate. It oversees postal rates and related concerns, having the authority to approve or reject USPS proposals.
The USPS is often mistaken for a government-owned corporation (e.g., Amtrak) because it operates much like a business, but as noted above, it is legally defined as an "independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States", (39 U.S.C. § 201) as it is controlled by Presidential appointees and the Postmaster General. As a quasi-governmental agency, it has many special privileges, including sovereign immunity, eminent domain powers, powers to negotiate postal treaties with foreign nations, and an exclusive legal right to deliver first-class and third-class mail. Indeed, in 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that the USPS was not a government-owned corporation, and therefore could not be sued under the Sherman Antitrust Act.[90]

I think that this could especially be valuable in developing countries where distribution of Bitcoin to the population has been one of the major snags to adoption
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:37:23
Well take a look at this: 
If we reach the same transaction output as Visa then we have a transaction bandwidth of 8 megabits every single second. That's quite a hog on communication networks. You are copying all of the worlds transactions in millions of places in real time. It's not a trivial problem.
As a comparison Visa only needs to copy the transactions once and then back them up twice to other data centers for security. It's definitely a fundamentally more efficient system (given that you trust Visa).
Now we can argue that the price of Bitcoin will go up at the same time as the transaction volume goes up (as Bitcoin goes mainstream). Let's assume a world where the price of Bitcoin is $100,000. At this point the effective price paid to miners to secure the network will be $2.5 Million every 10 minutes at current block rewards. Now we would need to divide that by the number of transactions at that point. The real cost per transaction will not be trivial.
Again, there was never any breach in the wall to wall systems of Visa or Mastercard. All the breaches have happened on the fringe (i.e. at Target terminals, store devices, etc).
I think it's hard to argue that a system that copies a transaction once and then twice more for security is not fundamentally cheaper than Bitcoin where each transaction gets copied million of times over. I agree that Visa needs to have snipers on the roof, a moat and crocodiles around their data centers. But crocodiles are cheap! :)

That must really suck re chargebacks because of fraud. However there's also an advantage to chargebacks if the merchant doesn't deliver. It's more of a conflict resolution mechanism. 
If you ask me, fraud should be covered by Visa not charged back from the merchants. If they weren't able to secure their network it's their fault not the merchant's

Right, but the value of any currency is the supply and demand of it today. The price of gold is not set by how much gold is in the planet's crust and will be eventually mined by 2140 :) 
Paying the miners is a cost that we need to undertake to secure this decentralized network. It's a fascinating technological development. I'm just wondering whether there are ways to decrease this cost.
At the same money level as the USD, a bitcoin would have to be worth $1Million given no fractional reserve banking. At that pointm, given current reward size, that would cost $25M every 10 minutes and $1.314 Trillion every year. Compare that to the current payments industry at ~$50Billion. I'm just saying all this because I love the technology but I'm sure there are ways to make this cost more realistic if we think of the end game. All issues should be put on the table so we can start thinking of ways to either solve or mitigate them :)

Oh I agree. I was commenting on the fact that Visa reverses payment on fraudulent charges from the merchant even after he delivered the service. That doesn't seem to fair and I actually would have assumed it would come from Visa fraud budget not the merchant

I think the law firm partner makes a great point in this article. Bitcoin is cheap now because it has no regulation. If it starts being regulated, the costs of compliance will keep on adding. One of the things that no one is talking about is the real cost per transaction which is currently around $35. The reason why we're not paying almost any transaction fees is because there's a subsidy to miners of 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes through seigniorage. We are collectively paying $35 for each and every transactions but the cost is spread to all the Bitcoin holders. If regulation adds more to this cost it will become an interesting situation. Here's the chart of real costs per transaction:

This is a great article. I'm trying to figure out what network these new technologies would piggyback on. Would it be bitcoin or their own network? If it's their own network then what would the miner incentive be to secure it? Fees?

Can you explain what you mean by off block transactions allowing leeway? To me it's an issue of paying for the same amount of security in the blockchain. Right now there's a high subsidy and each transaction is secured to the tune of $35 per transaction. Can there be a model where the off block transactions work if the block is not as secure?

It's a good point that if you go ask for advice from regulators you are framing the discussion towards regulation. They never lose their jobs for over-regulating, but they will for letting something bad happen and under-regulating (even if that chance is insignificant). They will thus always err on the side of regulating. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 18:05:25
Haha no
3% is sane and a mild incentive to spend/invest because of the positive time value of money.
You're right though. Your state in Argentina would be to get out of cash and into real assets as fast as you can. But that would make projects that are stupidly risky seem perfectly fine.
If you knew for a fact that my currency would lose 80% in the next year and someone comes to you and tells you that if you give them the money to rob a bank they will give you 3X your money with a 10% probability, your expected return from that would be 30% of your money left as opposed to 20% if you kept it in cash.
Of course that's a stupid example but it illustrates the risky projects that would be undertaken in such a hyperinflationary environment. It really distorts economic reality.
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:49:57
I fully agree with you. I was using bandwidth as a measure of size for the block given no pruning. AT 8Mb a second that's 10 minutes * 60 seconds * 1MB= 600MB
Over a day that's 600MB*6*24=86.4GB
Of course there are ways to prune it. But this storage and bandwidth cost is imparted millions of times over as opposed to a Visa/Mastercard where that's not the case. I'm definitely not a Visa/Mastercard fan.
My point is that the breaches in Visa/Mastercard happened at the fringes and denever in their data center. By that I mean terminals at Target, stolen credit cards, etc. The main reason why transaction costs are so high for Visa/Mastercard is the fraud insurance that you get. This is something that you don't get with Bitcoin. If your wallet is hacked or someone stole your paper wallet it's SOL :)

Thanks! That makes a lot of sense.
Here's an excerpt from one of the comments above. I'm copying it in case you missed the link. But thanks again for clearing it for me :)
Actually this has been shown to be untrue by [Meni Rosenfeld\[1\]]( back in 2012. The probability of success of a double-spend depends on number of confirmations, and the block interval has no effect. So 6 confirmations has the same security regardless of whether it is 10 min blocks or 1 min blocks.
As others have noted, however, the block interval is a trade-off between confirmation speed and blockchain fork rate.

You're right. I fully see your point. It's a cost that we all agree to pay in order to secure the network. 
Here's an answer that I gave above. I'd love to have your thoughts on the future size of this cost- Thanks! :)
I fully agree with you. I was using bandwidth as a measure of size for the block given no pruning. AT 8Mb a second that's 10 minutes * 60 seconds * 1MB= 600MB
Over a day that's 600MB624=86.4GB

This is something that you don't get with Bitcoin. If your wallet is hacked or someone stole your paper wallet it's SOL :)
But either way I agree with you that these costs will be mitigated by technology advancement. The one cost that will never be mitigated is the amount of subsidy provided to miners. The price of bitcoin will increase as transaction sizes increase. If we want Bitcoin to reach the same monetary supply as the M3 of USD, and lacking fractional reserve banking, we are looking at a bitcoin being worth $1M.
At that cost, miners would expend $25M on energy every 10 minutes given current block reward. That's $25M624*365= $1.314 Trillion/Year
Right now we have more computing power than the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined. And it's burning an extreme amount of energy for a task that is essentially hitting a nut until it cracks and gives you the number of preceding zeros that the difficulty level dictates. I think that applying this power to cancer research, science modelling, or any other pursuit would be a better use.
Keep in mind that I really love the technology and I think that having a decentralized network of trust will have far reaching positive effects. I'm definitely not trolling. I just think that there are issues that we should consider and address early rather than later.
By comparison the global payment industry is around $50Billion.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:27:34
We are paying it collectively. If there were 1000 bitcoins out there, every 10 minutes that number would jump to 1025, 1050, 1075, etc.
In effect the wealth of each Bitcoin holder is diluted to pay for the miners. However whazfan69 made a very good point in saying that it's the investment that we are all collectively making to keep the network alive.
@_date: 2014-06-24 18:29:10
Brilliant. Having a 3% inflation rate creates a positive time value of money. Therefore our equilibrium state is to invest and contribute to economic growth.

This is great. Imagine a model where you pay let's say 10$ a month. In return you get no ads and decide which videos to tip or not. At the end of the month, the $10 gets divided by the number of videos you pressed the tip button on. So if you pressed tip on 10 videos, each would get $1. Of course Google can take 30% of that so 3$ a month to not show you ads. I'm curious what the monthly customer value is on YouTube in terms of ads. It could be a very good patronage model.
