Is that your contribution to the discussion?
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:29:48
No it doesn't, for the same reason you pointed out.

Where did they say that bitcoin is used to fund terrorism? The statement mentions the possibility based on certain properties of bitcoin, it made no mention of whether or not it has already happened.

I'm a supporter of Bitcoin, but it's not my religion. I'm not entirely sure why you or anyone else feels the need to draw battle lines. Bitcoin has obvious utility, but as the world is today, fiat has more. To say I will never sell one for the other seems like unnecessary martyrdom.

Two problems:
1) Surely you see how weak your argument is regarding who might be lying on surveys and why your anecdotal data is more reliable. Despite your own beliefs on people's motivation, you're certainly aware that surveys are an tried scientific instrument and there are ways to do it right. Simply dismissing the results because "people lie", while accepting your own very limited and skewed data is somewhat ridiculous.
2) There's a good chance that people going to a computer repair shop are inherently (by and large) the less computer savvy of the population. They are not necessarily representative of the majority, or at least represent a very specific demographic. I don't know what I'd be comfortable inferring from that groups' responses.

A healthy dose of skepticism is always a good thing. Why does this community think otherwise when it comes to Bitcoin? Take their skepticism as an opportunity to do the research and edify yourself. Do not take it as an opportunity to gather talking points on topics you yourself may not understand. The latter does both you and them a disservice.

Attempts to manipulate sentiment like this is ineffectual and nauseating.
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:10:23
Fair enough, sir.
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:48:41
Such noble intentions are great, but what you've posed will only result in supporters giving statements on why Bitcoin is good without any real information as to why that is. 
Take a glance at the responses thus far and you see the standard rhetoric. Things like "Bitcoin is deflationary" from armchair economists that have no idea of the actual theories behind inflationary and deflationary currencies and their effects on macroeconomics. "Ask them about Fiat", which is such a nonsense statement that seeing it touted makes me wish their was a way to block people from accessing computers and displaying their ignorance on a global scale.
There's a wealth on information out there. Read and watch arguments from both sides, as well as neutral topics such as the economics, technology and human behavioral studies that are relevant to something like Bitcoin. 
You'll be hard pressed to find objective reasoning in a community that has already placed their bets. They're incentivized to convince others to adopt the technology, regardless of the arguments against it.

It's a trick even though cc companies spell out every possible fee in the Terms and Conditions that you agree to? What am I missing? Can't we disagree with a practice without labeling it a scam?
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:42:09
Lets not overlook the slight bit of irony in a couple of the lines:


In a real sense, Bitcoin is the system based on rules that are immutable outside of majority consensus, whereas the laws that govern fiat systems are very amiable to a powerful few, changeable when they are not, and downright ignoreable when it suits the 1%.
Food for thought.

Your beliefs do not trump my own, and they certainly do not trump laws. Your job as an ideologue is to try to bring me over to your way of thinking, subsequent to which I can redistribute my works under the appropriate copyleft licenses. To simply say that you believe in the free movement of technology/software/information is not enough to indemnify you from any act. Do not assume that your morality is superior to all else.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:20:39
No it doesn't.

So a company (potentially) paid for an ad that introduced a concept and then introduced their services, and because this company is disliked by some in the community, that subgroup feels validated in taking the company's work and editing it as they please? 
Was this video licensed CC? Was permission asked for or granted? even suggested adding other companies to an updated version "just to even out the playing field". Is this really happening? Are people supposed to take this community seriously?
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:20:18
I saw this post and was reminded about my CC extended warranty. Called my company to have my almost 2 year old cellphone replaced and it's now being processed. Say what you will about the fiat/currupt government controlled/Illuminati system, but I'm getting a new cell phone thanks to them.
Statistics mean nothing to the individual.

I think you want to say "[Full] Disclosure", not "Disclaimer".

You can't speak to a political coup while simultaneously saying "no one is forced to run the software [that core] release[s]".
The act of building and using classic _is_ an expression of not using core's implementation. If you firmly believe in the freedom of choice that your first paragraph suggests then you should support anyone's ambition to fork the software and/or the protocol. Consensus will determine the winner.
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:23:13
In general, sure. But note that your argument doesn't speak to why it's bad; you simply beg the question. Referring to political motivations and completely dismissing the only objective contribution of the project (a blocksize increase to 2MB) devalues your argument because it allows baseless attacks on the initiative supported by nothing more than an appeal to authority.

I believe the details of this particular use case are moot. That Fidelity needs more capacity is all that need be said, because no amount of detail would give any more incite into the needs of the other potential companies that see the capacity limit as an obstacle. We simply need to get to a point where the issue of TPS is no longer germane to the discussion of Bitcoin/Blockchain use. Programmed scarcity makes this technology a non-starter.

I'm confused as to why this question doesn't just have one or two answers to put the OP's mind at ease. Instead there are over a dozen answers essentially all regurgitating the same thing, with very few non-answer comments really adding any value to the conversations (yes, I recognize the irony).
My honest question is, why is this? What makes someone wonder in 3 hours after the question has been thoroughly answered and give a one liner which doesn't even come close to the comprehensiveness of the answers that preceded it? Is it for the Karma? Bobbing for tips? What?

@_date: 2013-11-13 17:18:24
Why would you guess that?
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:47:41
True, I didn't put forward any evidence, but the point wasn't really to prove anything. I only restated the Winklevii's claim (and noted it as such) and then went on to contrast that with a real world currency.
I think whether they actually hold 1% or not is besides the overall point though. The potential exists for there to be a strong concentration of wealth within a small group of early adopters, and that can be viewed as a potential threat to groups and governments.
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:51:35
I lost it all, but learned a valuable life lesson.
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:29:39
You do realize that your guess theorizes Coinlab's substantial loss in potentially revenue, and at the same time states that Peter is a baby for not simply accepting that lost revenue? There are far too many things wrong with this line of reasoning.

You shouldn't measure the simplicity of a thing by the rainy day scenario. The comparison holds because the current tax laws are complicated to follow for willing taxpayers whereas an everything-is-owned-by-the-state system would be very simple to comply with.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:22:42
I haven't suggested anything, nor am I discussing the technology per se. In fact, my only mention of the technology was to laud it.
My question was about the concentration of wealth and the potential reaction of representational groups such as governments.
Any hostility you perceived on my part probably has more to do with my loose wording. My apologies for that. Believe me, I have no ill intent. I just wanted to hear what others thought of the issue.
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:37:46
The problem as I see it is how difficult it would be for some individuals, and certainly governments, to accept and support Bitcoin.
A non-government group that controls 1, 2, 5% of the worlds wealth would certainly be viewed as a thread to any national government.
They would have the ability to at the very least inject instability in an economy and on the other end of the spectrum, potentially wage war. Money is power, etc. etc.

Actually, [Jamaica has over 110% cellphone penetration]( and [over 96% of households have cellphones]( Not devaluing the overall point, just contributing some numbers.

I know of the proverbial 1%, however I'd argue that this is a large group (in terms of the absolute number, not per capita) and also that their acquisition of wealth was slow and organic. With Bitcoin we have a (relatively) small group of early adopters that coalesced around the cryptocurrency idea in a very short space of time.
Such a phenomenon could suggest a group mind in terms motivation (for example, the whole Librarian slant that, true or not, is pervasive in the discussions about Bitcoin). Therefore you may lack the diversity that exists among the holders of large sums of other currencies. That group mind may strengthen the perceived threat level to a government.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:12:02
It's not about evidence behind the claim or even its validity. That sounds odd, but please understand that the example was used simply to motivate the thought experiment.
I'm not entirely sure why the hostility is necessary.
