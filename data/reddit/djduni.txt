Wait, i can’t own bitcoin and also love to smoke joints and jerk off? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:54:25
Thats kinda what I am saying too.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:25:34
Which ones are those?

Isn’t there an inherent issue of only 8 decimal points of value so if it gets too high you would have a “minimum transaction level” that you could not go below?

Fuck this hits home way too hard and way too soon.
I remember winning a hand of poker for 3 btc on sealswithclubs.

I run a business my mother started 18 years ago that provides preventive screenings for strokes, aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease and osteoporosis. 1 out of every 100 people we screen we save their life and find carotid arteries blocked 100% or an abdominal aneurysm about to burst. The screening costs about $150 and takes approximately 15 minutes. I'd love to send you some more information about what we do and how you could help!

Just to think outside the box. Did your brother have a phrase he would say often that rings solidly as something that only your brother would say?

Good. Education about bitcoin is good.

That fucking muppet on mtgox...i quit following btc for a few years after that. Just rebought back n for $250 worth. Dip my toes in the water.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:51
What? No, the opposite is true. Holding in an exchange is risky, see mtgox, and having a private wallet is the most secure option.

Definitely not the front of house crowd. Those guys are all apple zombies pushing apple care and iphones with more zeal than I can understand.
Source- A bunch of my old high school friends work at the apple near to me and if I ever go out with them anywhere all they talk about is apple. I've spoken to them about bitcoin and most are completely oblivious to its uses.

Apple actually employs 20-somethings in their stores that have college degrees to perform a lot of their services. All the friends I'm talking about are 25-27 now and have been working there for years. But yeah, I thought thats what you were talking about was the in mall employees.

As easy as email.
YEahhhhh... about that.

It said to verify first your deposit address so I didn't know what they meant by that.

 Correction: bitcents are already two dollars!
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:21:42
And you have transferred USD out of it to your bank account?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:23:25
Quit being such a pedant, you know I am speaking of extraction.

Where are you watching it I cant get any fucking charts to load?

Can you not read the large green banner running across the top of the page?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:06
Did you use 2 factor authorization?
@_date: 2013-05-12 08:18:53
Came willing to purchase motorcycle for bitcoin. Left disappointed. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:33:42
Oh awesome.
