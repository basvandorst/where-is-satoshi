@_date: 2018-01-16 10:10:07
Being a condescending cunt doesn't further your argument.
When the value was zero, the plan was for the value to go up.  From the word go.
It has been about a new way of negotiating price, or value.  It is about a more efficient way of transmitting value.
Currency, crypto or otherwise, is hinged on value at all times.  Relative to goods, relative to services, whatever.
Delude yourself into thinking whatever makes you feel better, but it is about price.  There's nothing wrong with that.  It's about price in a new way that isn't centralized and doesn't make moneylenders insane profits.

You have no idea how many people is "everyone" or how much money they had.  That would require clairvoyance.
You just want to say "I was right" but really you were just lucky, if you were even making these predictions when it was at $17k.
I have no stake in it, I bought at $200 and have only been screwing around with trading a small fraction of it for the learning experience.  So you can take your "you" and shove it up your ass sideways.  :)
I just wanted you to know that nobody believes you, so whatever endorphin drip you're getting out of this sad "I told you so" exercise is meaningless.

Some people are dead because some people do stupid things with money and are too weak and cowardly to deal with worst case consequences of their stupid decisions.
Some people just want to be right, and don't mind running around with shit in their hands smearing it on people and telling everyone they stink.
It wasn't luck.  It was an amount of money I was comfortable parting with, worst case scenario.  It was a good idea that still seems like a technology with a niche to fill.
Go jerk off into a fan somewhere else, and take your 'popping bubble' with you.
Even if it drops to $6k, it's still way up.  It's not hard if you don't turn into an emotional puddle over numbers.

I like that it incentivizes work but you still run into a "baseline other than 0" problem that I can't see being anything but inflationary.  Of course, our current welfare programs do that anyway AND they discourage work, so it would be an improvement.  Maybe UBI would be an improvement too, I just don't see it as a panacea.  I also think people are wrong about how it will affect people psychologically.  "Everyone will be free to pursue the things they are interested in/like/etc."  So, day drinking and drugs to cope with being useless?  Well, until the economy adjusted up and rent inflates from $600/mo to $1200/mo because the landlord knows what you make now and the maintenance guy now wants even more money because he shouldn't be paid the same as the people who live in the building and do no work, so...
I don't like any ideas that just "give" stuff to people based on nothing but their poverty level with nothing in return.  I like ideas that give more opportunities for them to fix it themselves, and while I think we have an absolute responsibility to care for anyone who is *incapable* of caring for themselves we have an equal responsibility to make anyone capable of caring for themselves do so.
I come from welfare-level poverty, but was blessed with parents who refused to live on the dole.  I've seen how welfare demoralizes and even breeds *resentment* toward society in the people I was surrounded by.  I'd like to see that ended but I don't think I'm smart enough to figure out how.
UBI, it seems, would be more of the same in the way free money demoralizes.  It doesn't empower.  We're tribal primates who almost above all want to feel useful and like we contribute to our tribe.  It's harmful to our psyche to take a reward without doing our part.  A negative income tax comes as a reward for work, so that aspect I think is undervalued - it doesn't demoralize people the way free money does because it is attached to work.
We have another huge problem too, and that is about 10% of the population has an IQ too low to be employed in any meaningful way, and as tech advances they are left more and more in the lurch.  I'm not talking about people with specific disabilities, but people who are in every way on parity developmentally but just don't have the processing power to do much.  They have the same psychological need to feel useful and a "part of the tribe."
People are messy.  I may be wrong about all this, and UBI might be the panacea, maybe it's negative income tax.  I don't think it is though.
How about you?  What do you think will work?  What do you think can't work?
EDIT:  I proofread that mess real fast and had to fix some things.

It's all arbitrary.  The value of any unit of currency is meaningless in of itself.  The relationships between goods and services are just expressed in the terms of the currency.  I don't care if the dollar buys me 10 gallons of gas or .01 gallons, so long as the prices of other goods are proportional as well.  Limited coins is irrelevant.  It's the values of goods in relation to each other that matters.

It holds true for any method of production.  By adding value to a good now instead of waiting until later, you maximize the return on that production.
Investing in business for turnaround becomes more time critical, not less.  Debt mongers don't like to hear this, they like the control they think they have with interest.
@_date: 2014-01-26 08:03:31
Spending =/= productivity.
It encourages spending.  Not productivity.  In fact, knowing that the value of your work will increase with time is an encouragement to produce.  I will work today for .05 BTC knowing that in a decade the value of that past work will only increase.
In inflationary systems, the value of your work also depreciates.  It encourages debt.  Not productivity.

I'm not just talking about labor.  But you said something I disagree with.  "You do not profit from the trade."  That depends on the value of the labor, doesn't it?  What your time and skill are worth is arbitrary, depending on the demand for your ability and time.  Exchanges can be profitable for both parties.  Any exchange.
Even flipping burgers.  Your time and skill are worth $0 if you sit on your ass unemployed.  It's worth $8.00 / hr if you sell it.  In fact, labor is the only purely profitable endeavour.  Your only investment is something that is valueless if it remains unsold.

None.  It will just reset what is now '0' dollars a year income as the bare minimum to whatever 'x' dollars a year income UBI is.  The prices of everything will adjust accordingly, because the economy is relative.
If everyone in the US started off with $20 or $20k or $200k as a baseline, the lowest rents will adjust accordingly, food prices, energy prices, all of it.
UBI just means 0 is no longer the lowest you can go.  Now it's X, and whatever X is will be factored into everything else.  It's inflationary though, so I'll give it credit in devaluing fiat currency.
You can't study UBI until the U part is enacted.

Wanted to buy more BTC.
Need to verify ID.  Card scans, info no good.  How?  It's me!  I move a lot, but am in US...
For 6 days I waited for a response from Coinbase to help find out what fields were giving errors.
On day 6, I hit the magic combination and got access to MY STUFF to make a PURCHASE!  Tyen had to wait days more for bank wire to fund wallet, which I was prepared for, but...
Those 6 days cost me $2k (today)  What that $2k will be in 12 months or more who knows.
Thanks Coinbase customer service.  If I could have reached a human being within 24 hours I would have lost nothing.  I was prepared to move with some buffer for xfers.  Not buffer for xfers and buffer for arduous task of accessing my own shit.

I think that's good advice, I was hoping to fund my USD wallet and buy on GDAX.
I couldn't make a purchase for several days anyway.  I eventually burned through all my attempts to fix my ID verification methodically until I got the magic combination of data in there.  It's something that could have been fixed in 30 seconds on the phone, but instead it took me almost a full week to get what they were looking for.

@_date: 2017-11-28 22:24:15
It doesn't, really.  The important figure isn't the dollar cost of the BTC, but the % of growth of your initial investment.
Buying .1 BTC now will put you in the same place as the people who bought 1 if you wait for the growth.  You can't get clouded by the "if only" thoughts that creep in when you think about the people who bought a lot and bought early.
The best way to invest is whatever you have disposable on a regular basis though.

I wanted to buy another BTC at the dip, and went to purchase and was told I need to verify my ID.  On an account I had already used to buy years ago.

Yeah, fuck GDAX.  I wanted to buy this morning.  If the difference between what I could buy vs. what I can buy when I get in is .1BTC, that's a fuckton of money in a couple years.
This is the second time in a month I've been fucked by Coinbase/GDAX either through shit customer service or unreliable service.

I was pretty vocal about BTC a few years ago, now my friends from back then are all asking on FB about how well I'm doing now.  I told everyone I spent most of it a couple years ago after getting a few hundred percent gains on it, I wish I hadn't spent it, I wish I had more.
"how much bitcoin do you have?"
"not enough, wish I had kept more."
Which is true, because I spent a LOT on food lol.

Being a Western European who spends time in other Western European countries doesn't count.  Hell, being American who lives in Europe or Canada or Australia doesn't count.
Go live in the MENA or East Asia and tell me that the reason the Japanese are so polite is because of their government.  Tell me the reason the streets are a diseased mess in every Arab country is because of their government.
Speaking of trying reading, my point was that people have different cultures independent of government.  You somehow read that to mean 'government makes people live a certain way' which is not to be found anywhere in my post.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:26:57
You've obviously never been outside your bubble.
I have news for you, it's not governments or crypto making those people live the way they do.  They live the way they do because cultures evolve in different directions when exposed to different conditions and factors.  They want to live how they live.  It's their culture.
**I** do not want to live like **them** and **they** do not want  to live like **me.**

It's youthful naivete that tells you we don't need countries.
You all need to go spend some time in other countries/cultures.  I'm not talking about the comfortable ones.
It's true that all people are basically the same, but all cultures are NOT and there's very good macro reasons to not want to live by Chinese cultural norms, for instance.  Forget about most of central and SW Asia or Africa, Sub-Saharan or North.
I've been all over the world, and you can fuck off if you think I want to live like 90% of the people on this planet.  Guess what?  They don't want to live like us either.  It isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing.

Nothing has a fixed intrinsic value though.  A meal worth $5 to one person might be worth $50 to a hungry person, even the same person at another time.  Demand and supply, supply and demand.  All a currency does is liquidate value of existing things for second hand trade of other things.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:43:03
Really?  Because its still worth way more than I bought in at.  Exchanges are irrelevant.  Its a p2p open source currency.  The exchanges and all the nonsense of the last 60 days should never have happened.  China in, China out, were better off than when we started.  If you buy btc to make dollars or yuan then you don't know what btc is about.  Look for banks cracking down more on direct exchange.  Back to cash and p2p.  Its meant to be a marathon and the sprinters are all falling out.  Good.

@_date: 2013-12-02 14:28:04
Proof of concept or capability, and not necessarily for obvious reasons.  Proving you can interweave bitcoin with old money seamlessly in a transaction process is actually good for transition to a bitcoin only economy.  Changing modes of thinking is a tricky and usually slow process for people.  I tell you this as someone who remembers when computers were magic machines and I kept my tech savvy a secret.  People looked at you like you could rob their life savings with their credit card number back in the 90s if you had computer skills.   ...nunc huck skills...  I'm pretty good with a Bo staff...

It's not about the actual transaction, it's about the technical capability to intermesh bitcoin with preexisting currency.

I bought a single bitcoin with coinbase.  To see how the exchane worked.  When coinbase first opened.  I made back every cent I put into it and could liquidate today by buying goods.  Dont be a butthurt troll just because you gambled your kids' college fund away when btc was at 1000 hoping like a greedy twat that it would hit 10000.
You dont know what the fuck you are talking about.  You think btc is a commodity like oranges, oil, and beef.  If you think the exchanges are pivotal to btc you need to go back and read the white paper.  Start there.  If you can grasp the concept.  If not, stick to US savings bonds.  Thats more your speed.
I dont care if all exchanges are outlawed.  I dont care if banks interfere.  The point of btc is the concept of open source, peer to peer, secure currency.  Got it?  Nothing about Chinese investing or exchanges is important.  Nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:47:50
Its not the "bad news" thing that gets this response.  Its the "lying twats" thing that upsets people.  The chase and china lies are propaganda because (shock) they are lies, not because they are negative.

Yeah, we're on direct deposit and there's ATMs even in Kabul.  I've yet to visit anywhere in the world where I can't get cash.  It can be a super pain in the ass sometimes, but not necessarily expensive.  Still, for ease of use and security I'd have (still would) prefer BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:37:18
Whatever helps you say "told ya so."  Market prominence should be the only growth driver for bitcoin. Exchanges just muddy the water.
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:41:42
Level headed response.  I love it.  I would personally *prefer* companies do their due diligence and proceed into Bitcoin deliberately and with a clear head.  It is better for the currencies credibility and long tern feasibility this way.  There are too many immature heads in this game right now that cannot think long term.  Take the time to build a strong foundation and you can build bigger.  Think.  Do you want $100k today or $100m in a few decades?  In reality, all that separates the rich from the rest is the ability to move strategically when the rest are moving tactically.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:13:17
It's something brand new and untested.  It is equally asinine to expect a body of evidence to support or refute a claim.  Right now it's mostly theory and potential.  Either you see it or you don't.  For those who see the potential, of course they are going to exuberantly support it.  For those who do not, of course they are going to deride the concept.  What baffles me is what the detractors think they will gain by coming to pro-bitcoin subs and pissing in the beer.
Nobody will know for sure for many years still whether it is a success or not.  It's an exercise in philosophies and concepts.  Anyone prognosticating absolute failure or success is delusional or lying.
Either you believe in the concept or not.  You either understand it or you don't.   People come in all different combinations of those spectra.
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:46:59
If you think of bitcoin as a commodity to be bought low and sold high, you dont know what bitcoin is for.  If you sell something for btc and then buy something for btc for the advantages of no fees no middleman no getting jerked around by banks or having credit card scams perpetrated on you, if you understand the inherent inflationary nature ofbfiat currency and dont trust bankers and politicians with money...  you are doing it right.  So please, all you commodity traders- take a hike.

Please, all you short-term speculators just need to get out of the game.  Get into bitcoin because of the premise and the promise it holds.  Now here's hoping we see sub-200 soon, I have some coin to buy.  For use 10 years from now.

You don't even need all that. The paths out of poverty also include a good attitude and superior work ethic.  I know.  I grew up blue collar / occasionally poor and my wife grew up on welfare.  Her and all 3 of her brothers are either surviving comfortably or doing well.  None of them spent a day in college.  This website is replete with people who have been told so many times for so long that it's not their fault and they can't do anything about it that they actually believe that they have no power to change their circumstance.  Most of the time, when it comes out in the wash, people end up exactly where their self - worth takes them.

You have no idea how bitcoin works do you?  A bitcoin is 'created' through mining, a process I won't explain here for brevity.  Now that its mined, what do you do with it?  You go find someone who wants to sell something for it, or buy it outright.  Peer to peer.  Right now there are people taking paychecks in btc.  I bought one of my MANY btc through coinbase.  The rest was barter and trade.  No banks involved.  I have no intention of ever converting a single coin or fraction of a coin back to a fiat currency.  You really need to read the posts in the sidebar, and then the sidebars of the linked subreddits.  At least have a basic understanding of the concept you are so self righteously and so erroneously lecturing others on.  The more banks and governments ban btc, the more legitimate the concept 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:13:25

You are irrelevant.

First, don't be overly sensitive.  I never once said you were one of the people pissing in the beer.
Second, read critically.  I agreed with your main points.  I especially agree about prognosticators being full of it.  Nobody knows.  As to whether its religious faith, thats an absurd statement.  I think, personally, that bitcoin has tremendous potential.  I could never hazard a quantitative guess at that potential.  My belief in that potential is based on what I know of fiat currencies and their rampant mismanagement.  It's based on how banks treat people.  It's based on the cumbersome systems we currently use.  It's based on big concepts that are really a matter of personal judgment.  Its opinion.  You are looking for quantification of opinions on an unproven idea.  Thats absurd, bro.
While we are at it, valuing cryptocurrency in terms of fiat currency is pretty absurd as well.  It's all relative.  Value is arbitrary in all these systems.

I'm annoyed that you got down voted.  Your statement is 100% correct.  Being a waiter or waitress is an individual choice.  As to who would wait tables?  It would be the people who WANT to wait tables, who unsurprisingly make more money.  My wife and I both worked food service.  I have no patience for people who think it's everyone else's responsibility to make them successful.  Fuck off.  If you hate waiting tables find another job, your shitty attitude is damaging to the restaurant- the restaurant some people actually WANT to work at.  Quality service attracts quality customers.  It's not about one or two shitty tips, it's about the big picture.  My wife and I made WAY more money than our peers who made minimum wage.  Plus work wasn't a drag because we busted our asses.  I'm thankful all the lazy fuck fans of standardized mediocrity didn't have their way.  I'm super supportive and generous toward good wait staff, if you suck but blame it on everyone else around you: the kitchen, the customers, the management- I know you.  I know you're either a fuckoff that takes long smoke breaks during a rush, or you ignore tables, you let drinks run empty, you're rude to everyone around you, just plain lazy or just not cut out for waiting tables.  Not saying shitty customers don't exist, or shitty restaurants don't exist, just saying that if your other customers don't make up for it that's your fault.  If you stay in a shitty job that's your fault.  Quit making excuses and get to making changes.

Im guessing youre just a moron who is pissed off that you didnt get in when it was pennies on the btc.  Or you panic sold.  Please tell me you panic sold.
