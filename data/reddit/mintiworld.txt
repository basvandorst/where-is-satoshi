"Physical" dollar is a good joke.

History and charts based on support/resistance lines. I cba to show you all my chart but if enough people ask I may upload for you all. It is messy since it is not made from short term trends, but rather the trends that are formed over months and years.
Just to let you know of current situation, there was a resistance point at 5650 from an old pump trend line long ago. Because of that resistance point and the volatility, it bounced up and down between that value. Now, imagine, if in volatile times like this, the major resistance lines get broken. Then historically, bitcoin has usually dropped all the way to the next major resistance line and not only at that, exceeding the resistance line by how much we were above the top resistance line. So doing the maths, We pretty much hit 4900, roughly 250~300 above the 4650 resistance line. With our next major resistance line our current time set around 4.4K, it may fall down to nearly 4K which is why I hint that this scenario is possible.
Also remind yourself of the definition of volatility. Yes, the long term term trend obviously points north but what goes up at the speed of light also comes down at the speed of light. In June, we went from 1800 to 3000, only for it to fall all the way down to 2000 again in around just over 2 weeks. Yes, it did shoot back up very quickly again, but that's precisely why I say keep your eyes close on the charts!

Yep I am aware. I am talking of situations where bitcoin continues to grow rather than falling down to oblivion once again hence I mentioned the Mt Gox. To reach 600 would take months and months however.

The fall that is soon to happen... keep close eye on the chart, you guys may get another crack at 4K.

Hi noob here. I get the maths but how comes you can split indefinitely? I would have thought you get 1 BT2 for 1 BT1 only once when they decide to airdrop the coins.

Nah, once you start to be able to read charts well enough, you trade and maximise profit (at least out-perform holding) as well as avoiding the risk of losing everything if the bubble pops.

Interestingly, even Ledger states that the BTG fork is already done too on their twitter acc.

Yep I am aware the main topic for this thread was on the 2X. Was just pointing out the fact that whilst the BTG site mentions the fork will occur on the 25th, firms like Coinbase and Ledger are stating that it is already done is all. I am not the most techie guy in these forums so I am just in a bit of a lost state that's all.

Wonder which is the real truth haha. I heard people tell me its not possible for this to not have been done already since they are pre-mining from a while ago.

Sorry bud unless bitcoin decides to crash away like it did in 2014, I don't think that is a possibility. the lowest it can go is around 3600 mark I feel.

Top shout. Thanks man!
