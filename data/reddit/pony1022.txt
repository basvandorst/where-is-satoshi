It’s called expanding your product offering. Another revenue stream. Business baby! I won’t be getting this card, looks nice though.

Bootlicker? Guess you’ve never bought crypto with fiat? The house/apt you live in, car you finance, credit cards etc are because banks give you the money. That’s assuming you’re a man and not living with your parents. Do you live under a rock or did you take advantage of these bank services? I would love to know the demographic of you maxipads? I bet the FBI can profile you losers perfectly.

When Chase bank customers suddenly cant buy crypto anymore, than we’ll see how cool and edgy these ideas are.

I think it’s good for the community to see, although we all know better than to buy from one of these machines. Sure it’s a ripoff...doesn’t mean people are going to buy. I see this as no different than checking Amazon before I buy something at the store to see if I’m getting ripped off. 
This is one way to bring familiarity to the non-crypto folk.
