I read it as 100 BTC at the cost of $4 each.

Good call - it's the [St. Louis Post Dispatch](

Additional questions asked me to submit the first word or phrase that comes to mind when I hear about bitcoin, whether I think governments should ban it or "Leave it alone!", rate how useful I think it is today and will be in the future, how it is now/will be best used, and whether I think it's mostly used for legal or illegal transactions.

I'm from St. Louis (Affton area in South County), and I just started paying attention to bitcoin.  I'd heard about it a couple years ago, and now I'm obviously regretting not getting into it then.  Anyway, it's exciting to hear that, at least anecdotally, there's some buzz about it in my hometown.  I keep hearing about how St. Louis is poised to become the next big tech town with ask the startups downtown, the Arch Grants program, etc.  Hopefully, by the time I move back after grad school in a couple years, BTC will be accepted at least a few places around town!  Thanks for sharing!
P.S.  I'll have to try that steakhouse sometime when I'm in St. Peter's.  I didn't get out there much when I lived in St. Louis, let alone since I've been out of town, but there's a decent  chance I'll move out that way when I move back into town because of the affordable real estate.

I know it's not much, but it's all the BTC I have to give.  Thanks for doing this!

I just signed up for a Coinbase account and am getting started.  Hopefully, my Bitcoin wallet will be that fat one day!
