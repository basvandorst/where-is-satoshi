It's been around at least 8 hours: 
It's not unusual for security people to drop everything to work on something that has the potential to go big like this.

And we need better bug bounties. I've been paid $500 for  vulnerabilities that could be used to steal btc from wallets/exchanges.

If you trust Bitseed then a pre-synced blockchain is fine. If you don't trust them, you can't safely use *any* software or hardware that they supply and buying one of these Nodes off them is a waste of time.
So, it doesn't make any significant difference whether the blockchan is pre-synced in this context.

I mostly just lurk here, but I thought I'd share this technical post I wrote about exploiting a particular vulnerability in a few bitcoin exchanges. The specific vulnerabilities discussed in the post are all patched now so there's no reason to panic, but I highly recommend avoiding storing bitcoins online if at all possible.

Uh, you know it's trivial to fake screenshots right? A link to reddit is far more trustworthy. If you want to stop someone modifying it, use archive.is

I'm a pentester and what's happening here is completely illegal. I pentest live systems all the time but only with consent from the owner.

How about making a counterfeit that doesn't run Ledger's firmware?

Cryptographic attestation to what?
