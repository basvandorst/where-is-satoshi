So in the end, was it worth it? Jesus Christ. How irreparably changed my life has become. It's always the last days of summer and I've been left out in the cold with no door to get back in. I'll grant you I've had more than my share of poignant moments. Life passes most people by when they're busy making grand plans for it. Throughout my lifetime I've left pieces of my heart here and there. And now, there's almost barely enough to stay alive. But I force a smile, knowing that my ambition far exceeded my talent. There are no more white horses or pretty ladies at my door

Average age of the millennial is 25.6 - currently the largest group of 25.6 year olds to ever exist... People start investing at this age. Millenials in general have far less trust in government and banks then ever in history.. Just think of the inflow (if even just a small % of them allocated a small % of their portfolio) with the supply decreasing by next halving... Im not saying 50k by 2018 im saying 50k by 2020 - with an extremly high probability... Now that risk return is amazing given that bitcoin aint going anywhere. Im coming from a 3rd world country and the demand is constantly increasing as we see our inflation rise due to the populist government elected by the uneducated. I will continue to DCA into bitcoin with 30% of my portfolio unless something fundamentaly shifts. Bitcoin has been attacked by so many things making it anti fragile and hands down the most decentralised store of value. LN second layer would be great but right now bitcoin serves the use case for me. I can only invest 27% of my money in offshore equity legally but bitcoin is fine so getting rand hedged is what i and many other South Africans want.
