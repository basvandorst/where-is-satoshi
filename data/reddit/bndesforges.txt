Move to GDAX first and then to your wallet. You will avoid fees this way
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:10:32
Take that money and buy bitcoin instead.
Mining requires more then a rig to be efficient. It’s noisy and you will probably need to sell your bitcoins to pay for electricity bill.
You also create new risk associated with hardware. Will the rig catch fire? Will the power supply fail and will need to be replaced? The miner can also fail and need replacement.
TL;DR : buy, hodl.

QuadrigaCX is your best bet. You won’t be able to do it instantly since you have to get verified but once done it will be the fastest way for you to convert to fiat

Thing is : we don’t know how much whales are dead (adress with lots of coins that are unreachable)
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:48:52
Then flip to GDAX and send to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:16:02
Transfer to GDAX then to cold storage. This transaction could have been fee less.

5 sat is $0.0005663651 USD
But tx fees are in sat/bytes so fees depend on the bloc size.

Agree with you ! I had a 150% rate of return in the last 30 days but now it’s down to just 86%! I’m done with this shit
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:50:37
Source : did it
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:24
Did the same thing to me, I tryed 5 or 6 times and it worked
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:33:08
Use another exchange
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:50:49
Move it to gdax (free) and then to your wallet (also free)

Got my private keys out of my own reach. I have to make a two hours drive to get to my father’s safe. He is instructed to not let me panic sell before 2022
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:49:55
I totally agree with you! Like last week I went to buy beaver pelts since it’s getting pretty darn cold in Canada. That guy at the general market said « that’ll be 15 dollars per pelts, friend »
I said « guy, how about you take 3 gold coins per 2 pelts? ». He said that I should consider selling my gold for money before I buy stuff.
What a retard

Best option for you. I am a user, I don’t represent that compagny

In what world is 10cents considered high fee ?

I found a dongle that has a 336mh/s rating.
According to a calculator I found online, I would mine 0.00000279 BTC/ month.
Wut ?
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:42:24
If I have a decent computer that haven't been plugged in the last year, what would be the easiest way to get it to mine ? I basicaly live where electricity is the cheapest on earth. 
How to profit plz ?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:53:12
For me it would be a game changer. We canadians have what we call a tax free saving account. Any capital gain made in a BTC etf would be totally tax free.
Also, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to sell BTCs here. Everybody is willing to sell it to you but few exchanges buy it back.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:04:28
I use blockchain.
I know it’s not the best out there, but I just give it the public key of my paper wallet. When I’ll be ready to transfer, it will get the private key and I will transfer the money right away.
Not really usefull if you plan to spend your bitcoins but convenient for hodling since you can see how much your coins are worth at any time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:41:11
Exactly what I did since the beginning. That’s why I have a really hard time understanding why people tell newcomers to secure their 0.0012 BTC with a 100$ wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:25:25
Realised that last month after selling in July at ~5000 CAD. Thing is, we are Hohmann transfering the shit out to the moon so there is no turning back

Wait what ?
Was it that guy? That story was savage beyond measure. 
Edit : looks like it 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:39:39
Hardware and paper wallet are your best bet. You should weight the pros and cons of those two
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:27:29
Canadians will hit that tomorrow
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:58:32
Yeah...that’s how it is. The only way to prevent that is to buy from GDAX, which you can’t do because you are Canadian.
The best way for us canadians to buy bitcoin is through QuadrigaCX.
There is the same 2.5% fee on buying, but then you can put a limit order, so you choose which price you want to pay.
I still use coinbase for quick buys when dips occurs, but for coins that you plan on hodling, use Quadriga

Check your pm
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:39:26
Well there are very few ways to sell bitcoin in Canada. You could always sell for cash on kijiji or something like that but you are then doing tax evasion. You expose yourself to other risks
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:01:46
Canadian financial advisor here,
Your money is held through a registered pension plan, which is (taxwise) the same thing as a RRSP. 
If you take money out of it (which you can do only because it is less then 20% of the AGA (Admissible gains amount), you will be taxed as income, meaning that you will probably get 3 000 out of the 4 000 after taxes, depending of your annual income for 2017.
You can say « yeah but those bitcoin will give me 1 000$ in no time » but you will yet again be taxed on the capital gain.
I would rather suggest you to consider buying bitcoins with what other people would have put in a TFSA. What about the actual income that you got you the 4 000$ pension plan in the first place? Is there any left of it? If not, you might not be in the best position to hodl bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:22:00
He mispelled fiat
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:32:14
What about paper wallets ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:32:03
They could see that you have x amount on your coinbase account.
The problem is : they can’t know for sure who owns the trezor address. So even if send money from your trezor to somebody else, it could be a 3rd address that belongs to you, the guy you sold to, or even a 3rd person that receive a payment from the second guy if you took money off coinbase directly to him
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:23:29
Pay credit card debts if you have some.
If not, stay in crypto.
This is not advice but what I would do if I was you
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:30:27
Way to go,
Just by the fact that you threw like 60$ in crypto back then shows that you made sick gains. You should not be worried by the price.

What if amazon uses some of its computing power to mine the following coins? They get paid in bitcoin by some users, shivel the transaction fees, declare themselves owner of the moon...
Next step : Mars

Showing up at my office as a financial advisor would be...interesting
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:10:12
I would recommand blockchain. It is compatible with TouchiD and offer a lot of security steps. 
What I do is store my btc on a paper wallet and hold my public key on blockchain as a « read only » wallet
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:04:11
Paper is just a non-fancy way to store your private key. If you decide to fund the wallet, you send coins to the public key of your paper wallet. This part happens on the internet.
It’s now on the paper wallet because it’s on everybody’s ledger.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:00:40
I agree with you. I personally believe that it won’t happen (at least in the next 1-5 years) and that it’s the rumor of the day.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:02:09
I bought today and didn’t had any issue
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:13:18
That’s like the church banning dirty thoughts. You can tell everybody it’s bad but you will never be able to control it.
