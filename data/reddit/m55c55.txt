Is this also true for incoming payments?

Can I send such an invoice without a full node?

You always have the possibility to settle to layer 1, but you simply don't need to. People will use layer 1 for  bigger amounts of money. Furthermore a block size increase in the future is possible as well.
It makes no sense to store all transactions of everyone's coffee expenses on tens of thousands of machines.

I think we'll see. Nobody really knows at the moment what 2018 will bring, if Lightning really works on large scale and how the fees develop. I agree that the scenario you mentioned seems valid.

What is going on here? Any news out there?
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:34:03
Lightning network and payment channels.

The assumption you made is that you get your payment as regular on-chain Bitcoin transaction.  However, you can get your monthly payment through a channel so there is no need for all those on-chain transactions in theory.

I'm using the CoinMarketCap (unofficial) app. It's simply great:

A segwit transaction is smaller, therefore you pay less fees.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:06:17
This is crazy. But I like it :-)
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:02:29
Yes it is
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:57:53
Thanks for clarifying that :)

You probably should look for Nexus Earth if you really wanna bring the block chain society into the universe.

Thanks, especially for those links. 
I'm a software developer by myself and I know that time frames are a difficult topic. ;-)

What does this answer mean?
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:47:11
Search for TenX
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:22:36
Yes, you can

Because you should never type your seed into a system which could be compromised.

Ledger, yes. Trezor, don't know.
