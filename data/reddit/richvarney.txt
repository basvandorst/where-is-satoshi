When you hold the private key to your cryptocurrency  then you rightly own it. You can continue to hodl or send to elsewhere. However, if the cryptocurrency sits on an exchange where they control the private key then they could go bankrupt and run with the money... as one example.

Wow and today I finally set up a full node, what a happy coincidence.

Believe this would be what you are looking for (if using GDAX exchange) 
This gives you Unix time, low, high, open, close, volume for the most recent 300 timescales. 
Granularity changes the timescale and is measured in seconds however, check the documentation for further info. 
For example, I used this formula in google sheets to give me the mean average BTC price in EUR for the last day:

This is an old post I know, but I wanted to share how I fixed this problem:
My situation was that I was using Tails OS and the default installation of Electrum that comes with it, v2.7.9. I had this Tails Electrum set up as my offline wallet and a watching wallet set up on my online computer. I could create the transaction file on my online watching wallet, but when I had transferred it to my offline wallet to be signed, I had the error "server is not answering". This is a bug in Electrum 2.7.9 and so you need to upgrade the version or use the following workaround.
(1) Create transaction in watching wallet.
(2) Save unsigned transaction file **unsigned.txn** to USB stick. 
*Here is the part that differs*
(3) Download Electrum v2.9.3 install from Python source [download.electrum.org/2.9.3/Electrum-2.9.3.tar.gz]( or [electrum.org/ and copy to your USB.
(4) Go to your offline Tails OS, insert the USB stick and extract the **Electrum-2.9.3.tar.gz** file.
(5) Right click in the extracted folder and choose "open in Terminal".
(6) Type "python electrum" and press enter key. It should look like this:


(7) After a few seconds, Electrum v2.9.3 will open.
*This part is back inline with standard procedure*
(8) In the Electrum cold wallet click "**tools&gt;load transaction&gt;from file**", open the **unsigned.txn** file.
(9) In the window that opens, click sign, then save the **signed.txn** file to your USB.
(10) Remove the USB stick and insert back into your online computer. In the watching wallet, click "**tools&gt;load transaction&gt;from file**" open the **signed.txn** file. Click broadcast then close the window.
(11) Wait for your transaction to confirm. Wait times will vary.
Note that you must already have the cold wallet in your Electrum 2.7.9 persistence folder in Tails OS. This is so Electrum 2.9.3 can find the wallet automatically and you don't need to worry about restoring a wallet from seed or anything like that.
I found it was not possible to upgrade Electrum in Tails OS, so that's why I went with this method and it seems to work fine.
Hope this helps anyone who got stuck like I did.
