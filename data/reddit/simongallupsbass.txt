I think there's plenty of room for competitors at this point, especially with LN development and integration.  It's a pretty straightforward business model too.  if you can provide an easy, front facing consumer grade solution that allows website operators, apps, or even retail PoS systems to process crypto rewards and for endusers to easily redeem them I think you'll have people tossing bags of money at your face at some point.  That's an app or service you can monetize.

If we were to compare this to the early internet, Bitcoin today is the internet before DNS where you had to write down all the IP addresses to know where the fuck you were going.
The fact is Bitcoin is still in nerd territory.  This shit isnt usable for a majority of the public at this point.  We need front facing applications that make it usable.  We need 2nd layer solutions like LN that allow us to swap and pay through a multitude of different currencies without the end user's head exploding.  We need easy onramps and offramps back to localized currencies.
When Bitcoin has front end applications that make it easy for moms and dads to use without needing technical assistance, then we're going to see it take off.  The next halvening will also restrict supply and should therefore increase price.

Regulation is coming whether we like it or not.  The more mainstream crypto becomes, the higher the likelihood governments begin regulating.
Now we have an opportunity at this moment to regulate ourselves.  We can either choose to self-regulate, like the movie industry did by adding the ratings system to stave off the government, or we can choose to ignore the bad actors in the space that will cause the government to clamp down even harder.
The ultimate point is staying silent means we condone the behavior.  The debate isnt going to be won or addressed by ignoring it.  Especially given the fact it directly impacts the Bitcoin brand.  The debate isnt the thing keeping the claim alive, the fact they are misrepresenting Bitcoin using consumer facing Bitcoin branded channels is what keeps it alive.  People search for Bitcoin and land at Bitcoin.com.  Ignoring that isnt any kind of solution to that problem.  The threat of legal action and potential jail time for fraud is what will end that debate.

Nope, pandora is officially out of the box.  There's no putting it back in.  The decentralized network protects against government seizure by spreading it globally.
They could try and ban the use of bitcoin, but a black market will still exist and the network would still be functional and the effort to police the actions of individuals is too great for them to adequately enforce.
In the end, it's the people who will decide if bitcoin lives or dies.  If they lose faith in the existing system (not a far fetched possibility given the crash of 2008) or that system collapses under the weight of debt, there is now a viable replacement the people can use in its place.

There's plenty of evidence for why markets are regulated and you've offered nothing to explain why regulation is unnecessary or how unregulated markets are a benefit to anyone but the richest participants.
An unregulated market is like the wild west.  He who has the most power, in this case capital, sets the terms for all the other participants.  Unregulated markets let the thieves prey upon the innocent with no repercussions because peopleare naturally greedy and covetous.  This is why bitcoin was created with a trustless system, because people cannot be trusted to act altruistically.

Privitization doesn't work.  We've seen the results with private prisons and schools.  Not only can they not provide the service more cheaply, but many end up being scams.  When entire counties were privatized, they went bankrupt and the administrators embezzled the money.  The quality of the services like privatized public transportation actually decreased, the fees increased, and the company failed to turn a profit requiring even more subsidies from the taxpayers.
Ultimately, you're stll paying taxes in fees for a private entity to provide the same service with a motive for profit.  A government provides those services without a motivation to profit.  That's why 98% of Medicare funds go to providing care when a private medical provider needs at least 12% for administration.

That sounds like turning over the apple cart and anarchy.  I don't think the majority of people want that.  The anarcho capitalists seem to forget that what creates this vibrant economy is rule of law, judges, courts, jails, police, security, intellectual and property rights, roads, water and power, education and all the services that are provided by a stable government.
Without that we're a bunch of savages.  It's infinitely harder to conduct business when the local rules change arbitrarily.  
If we de-fund the government, we de-legitamize our rights, most especially our property rights.  At that point we can only keep what we can realistically hold and defend by any means necessary.  Whoever has the bigger or the most guns is just going to take it from you by force.

Vertically integrated companies have an entire supply chain that starts with the raw resources all the way to finished products.
Apple for instance is in the process of vertically integrating their own custom ARM processors into their entire line of products instead of relying on Intel to produce CPU's for their laptops and desktops.  This way they will start to integrate their OS development to support ARM as opposed to supporting both ARM and Intel implementations.  It also reduces their cost and eliminates any potential delays in sourcing processors from Intel.  The benefits are they gain more control over their supply chain, the drawbacks are they assume the responsibility and cost for developing and producing those items.

Yes, and we lose hundreds of millions every year to charter school fraud.  Did you know Betsy DeVos is an advocate for charter schools?  Beyond that we spend 1/10th the amount of money on education that we do defense.  It's arguably the most important expenditure in the budget because it prepares our kids to compete in a global economy.  A high school diploma just no longer cuts it in this job market.


That's clearly a ridiculous idea.  A living wage is more manageable.


Automation has been happening for years.  That's why the middle class has collapsed since the 1980s as factory jobs moved overseas.  That's why we need to invest in education to skill our citizens up because the high paying jobs wont be available unless our kids have college degrees and high tech skills.  Subsidizing coal mining or steel production doesnt prepare us for that future.  A UBI is probable if we end up using technology to completely replace labor.  We've reached a convergence point where the costs to automate using AI and robotics has threatened everyone's jobs.  An automation tax that funds a UBI is probably the only realistic course of action.  Of course, you dont have any ideas of your own on this matter.

Vocational training in jobs that are disappearing doesnt prepare us for the future.  But it plays a viable part of increased funding into education to help provide social mobility.
This market is driven by technology.  In order to stay ahead of this curve, we need a skilled citizenry that can adapt to the landscape and be in position for those high paying jobs.  They need to have the skills to innovate within that space.  We cultivate this space by funding research and development at schools and universities, providing full ride scholarships for kids in STEM programs in exchange for future work at a reduced rate, and we do our best to make education into these fields easier and affordable for every citizen in the country.  In the 1950s under Eisenhower, a Republican, college was free.  He called education a critical pillar in our national defense.  That period is also called the Golden Age.
Instead we've made college education so expensive middle class families have to leverage their entire lives to send their kids to school.  The out of pocket costs for education have risen literally thousands of percent since the 1990s.  This is opportunity denied and a contributing factor for why the middle class continues to implode.  We live in a service economy where the majority of jobs don't pay a living wage forcing people who work full time to apply for benefits.  This is why we need to raise the minimum wage and make college affordable.

Regulation sets legal standards for how those markets operate.  They provide a rule of law, delineate property and ownership rights and enforce contracts made between parties.  They protect against fraudulent behavior and set standards for that marketplace.  This becomes even more critical in international business across global markets.
You havent shown that an unregulated market can achieve the same kind of economic scale that a regulated market can.

80% of new business fail.  That's the nature of business.  That doesnt mean making investments in new businesses scaling new technology is a bad thing  The fact is we employ more people in solar now than we do in coal and they make higher wages as a result.
A lot of those investments we made failed because Republicans pulled their funding.  They had been guaranteed funding, started scaling based on those guarantees, and then those Republicans killed that funding.  The Chinese ended up buying those companies for pennies on the dollar because Republicans played politics.
They werent scams.  We've driven the price of solar down to be at cost parity with natural gas.  In some regions we're producing so much solar that independent coal plants are shutting down because they arent producing energy at a profit.  We have a growing EV car market where all the major manufacturers have produced cars for thanks to companies like Tesla.  Battery technology has also gone through a renaissance.  Our drones are using fuels derived from algae, created by one of those alleged "green energy scams".

Nobody is packing blocks 100% at the moment.  There's still tons of room available in most blocks.  Solutions like segwit and lightning will add significant scale to the current block size.  Once those blocks start hitting 100% then the need for increased block size becomes a relevant question.
Segwit hasnt been a failure.  Those that have adopted it have reduced fees substantially.  Major exchanges have made that implementation because it also reduces their cost.  Some developers have been quicker to implement it and others have dragged most likely because those fees bring them additional revenue but the market will punish them if those fees remain high compared to their competitors.
How much of the "catastrophe" from Nov/Dec was manipulated remains to be seen,  We do know for a fact the chain was getting spammed with low fee transactions as an attempt to increase fees.
The plans for scaling are already underway and segwit and lightning are excellent scaling solutions.  Once they reach volume then the conversation about raising block size becomes legitmate but at this point it's really a non-issue because blocks arent getting stuffed to the gills every 10 minutes.
Big blocks do not substantially improve throughput.  BCH cant even fill a block and their already talking about increasing the blocks more.  It's not an adequate solution to scaling and never will be.  All it will do is centralize BCH miners, which we've already seen happen.

I disagree.  I think the community needs to keep putting pressure on them until they abandon their fraudulent marketing.
When Bitcoin Cash can start marketing on the merits of their project instead of trying to steal the Bitcoin brand, then we can condone their presence in the space.  Until then they are a threat to the entire crypto community because they purposely and willfully lie and misrepresent both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin and that is simply untenable.

Regulated markets have bad actors but there are fewer than unregulated markets.   Market participants look for areas without regulation in order to exploit the market.

No, it doesnt necessarily need to remain stable.  All currencies are volatile.  People make their living trading in currency markets every day.
Stores and mortgages will price according to the equivalent value of the localized currency.  So if you get a mortgage for a $350k house and the seller wants payment in btc, it will get converted to btc and sent to the seller.  Then your liability is based on the conversion rate at the time of sale.  So you owe the equivalent of $350k minus whatever your down payment is.  If you are storing your wealth in btc and it keeps rising in price, the mortgage payment becomes LOWER over time based on the conversion rate to USD for instance.  All the conversions will take place behind the scenes.  Bitcoin isn't going to completely replace all currencies, it will use all the currencies as more and more people store their wealth in BTC and downconvert.

The purpose of the government is more than just distributing money.  It's to codify and enforce law and order through a Constitution and court of laws, the guaranteeing of the rights of its citizens, the protection and defense of those citizens and in many cases providing the infrastructure, the security and education of those citizens so a vibrant economy can form and operate according to those laws.  You cant have property rights without a government there to enforce them.  You cant have contracts and business agreements without a court to arbitrate disputes according to the laws.  Those laws enforce competition in the economy by disallowing the formation of monopolies or creating standards by which goods can enter the marketplace that protect citizens safety or health.
Poverty is the result of supply and demand based economics.  People need to starve for food to be valuable.  This is an unfortunate byproduct of the world that has been created and anarchy will not solve that problem.  Providing opportunity and education to the citizens of a country so they can contribute and take part in an economy where the wealth is distributed due to labor or production of goods and services is what will deliver them from poverty.  The poverty is what drives the crime because we live in a supply and demand economy and without opportunity to become part of the economy the only viable option to feed your family is crime.
The current problem is the banks control the printing of the money.  They own the money supply.  And as long as they have that control, the government is beholden to them, not the people, because it needs that money to operate.  By restoring the control of the money to the citizens, putting the power of the purse back into their hands, the country now has to serve them because they control that supply rather than the banks and the businesses.  We still need the government.  We still need laws and courts to enforce our rights.  We still need a centralized organization to provide national security and regulate the economy.  We still need old dudes bickering about the best ways to spend money that is collected in taxes.  Anarchy doesnt guarantee your rights, it doesnt uphold your rights to property or keep you safe from whoever may want to take it by force, nor does it enforce the underlying terms of the smart contract you wrote.  Anarchy doesnt allow a vibrant economy to form, it simply allows the person with the most guns to exert dominance over those around them.

Kind of a reductive argument dont you think?

Maybe we can talk about how regulation needs to exist in capitalism or else we get rigged markets, restricted innovation, constantly increasing prices, no competition and monopolization.  Let's talk about how that destroys the middle class and stratifies society into the extremely rich and the extremely poor.  That's not freedom.  That's slavery to a corporate superstate where the only people with citizenship rights are those with wealth or those worthy of employment in an increasingly automated world where labor is the next industry to be eliminated in the search for profit.

When you see the order book on Coinbase Pro, it's a list of all the buy and sell orders and the prices they are at.  Those are orders placed by users with coins or cash on the exchange, all Coinbase is doing is matching orders and taking a percentage.
They have reserves on hand for cash flow purposes, but the truth is they are simply matching a seller to a buyer and taking a cut.  They are doing the internal account management.  I'd imagine most of their internal transactions are not done on chain to reduce cost and improve speed and they are only written on chain when they are moved into cold storage or in/out of the exchange.  I'm sure they dont want to keep a bunch of funds in a hot wallet so it probably gets moved for security too.
Look at Switcheo to see what an order book looks like when there's not enough buyers and sellers.  It's not like an exchange has to sit on BTC to sell, they just need enough volume and users to match orders and make profit on the trading fees.
When the Coinbase app processes a buy, it's basically just buying a market order from a seller on Coinbase Pro and Coinbase gets to add another convenience charge fee for processing the transaction and then another 5-10% adjustment on the average BTC price the user pays or sells at.

In effect, the businesses are being subsidized by the taxpayer if the employees are making so little they need assistance.  This is why unionization was such a critical aspect of a functional economy, because it allowed a limited market of specialized laborers to bargain for fair wages and as a result expanded the middle class because more wealth was distributed to those employees.  The system we've created now just aggregates the wealth to the top and punishes the working class through higher and higher cost of living and use taxes while the businesses get to keep more of the profit.

Anarchy isn't the point.  Anarchy doesnt uphold property rights, provide security, or a court of laws that upholds contracts.  Bitcoin allows the control of the wealth to return to the people instead of the banks, restoring their sovereignty in the system.  Anarchy is a problem.  We cant form a vibrant economy without courts and laws and centralized governments that enforce those laws and the rights of the citizens.
And the government cannot run without the taxes provided by the citizens.  When the citizens hold the purse, they end up being in control instead of the banks printing money on demand.  The government then has to serve the people instead of the banks.

Thinking about a world of streaming money, global currencies and mass adoption has me wondering if we're going to create a society where everything is pay to play and if our idealism today will lead to a horrifying future.

Crypto has the potential and probably will change the world.  I havent been this excited about a technology since the internet.  But like the internet, that idealism was quickly rolled over by the wheels of progress and commercialization of the technology.  I guess I'm just now starting to realize how this could happen in crypto and how the idea of being freed from the bondage of rich, centralized institutions may end up imprisoning us all by being able to monetize and microcharge for everything we do.

Money in savings accounts appreciates because you are earning interest.  That money can also be put in other investments like CD's.  The point of putting it in savings is so it appreciates. 
We've already seen bitcoin used as the basis for the international trade of wheat from Russia to Turkey.  It has an excellent use case for international trade between currencies because the local currencies can be converted to BTC, sent, confirmed and converted back to the destination currency in half the time and a fraction of the cost it would take for a standard wire between domestic accounts.  In the traditional system this process could take days and cost exponentially more in fees.  They would have more exposure to fiat volatility than BTC volatility at that point.
In your elementary example you are neglecting the price of BTC at the time of exchange.  So your incremental use of btc for candy and coffee could be exponentially higher and I may get a car for 0.5 BTC because I held.  If that is the case, I would be smarter.  
Your example doesnt prove me wrong because you made an assumption about the exchange price between USD and BTC being static when we've been talking about it being deflationary the entire time.

You're stuck on this myopic idea that it needs to be used for a cup of coffee when there are better alternatives to buy a cup of coffee.

People use the money in their savings accounts to buy cars, houses, pay for medical expenses, invest in stocks and other major purchases.  It doesnt make the money any less usable.  It's just a dumb idea to blow through your savings buying coffee and candy bars when theres money in your checking account.

There's a certain amount of cognitive dissonance with the libertarian attraction to bitcoin in my opinion.  Most of us were attracted to bitcoin because it obviated the need to trust third parties who have proven time and time again they will steal peoples wealth because people are inherently corrupt.
We see that in our current economic climate, the more deregulation we have the larger the gap of income inequality grows and the quicker the wealth aggregates to the top.
So it baffles me that bitcoiners get a hard on for libertarianism which essentially advocates for removing all regulations that protect the wealth of citizens from corrupt businesses and wealthy individuals.  That collectively they want to place their trust in these groups and individuals to act responsibly and altruistic without any oversight whatsoever, blindly trusting the "market" to regulate itself.  
Even within the bitcoin space, we have a bunch of scammers and market manipulators, exchanges gaming trading volumes, mining cartels performing 51% attacks and basically all sorts of unsavory unethical shit because of the lack of regulation.
It's like we all forgot why Bitcoin even came into existence in the first place after the 2008 crash.  This liberatrian fantasy that the market and participants will regulate themselves in the absence of regulation is laughable.  We have no evidence these players will act responsibly, in fact, all the evidence points to the opposite conclusion that without regulation the scamming and manipulation and profiting from unethical behavior will become the norm.

You're clearly not grasping the idea and have completely misunderstood what I said.
People dont normally walk into a dealership with $20,000 in cash to buy a car.  They use different methods to make that down payment or pay off that car than bringing a suitcase full of cash to the dealership.  There is a liability and security risk in carrying that cash in the first place.  The money for that transaction is most likely coming from their savings account, because savings accounts allow those funds to appreciate over time.  People dont use their savings accounts on their daily expenses because the point is that cash is supposed to appreciate and grow. 
Using bitcoin or ANY DEFLATIONARY CURRENCY to buy candy bars is a dumb idea, financially.   Its like paying your bills from your savings account, which most people use to save in order to buy big ticket items like cars, houses, vacations, medical expenses, etc.  
The security of bitcoin makes it a better solution to send large amounts of money because it obviates the risk of trusting third parties to handle your money.  It costs less to use and is done faster than using traditional fiat.  Using bitcoin to buy candy bars is stupid because your wealth is no longer appreciating due to the deflationary nature of the currency.  You're working against your own interests.  Using it for large transactions is smarter because its more secure and reduces your risks and can be done faster than any financial institution.
You could use it for candy bars and coffee.  It's just a stupid idea to do so because its a deflationary currency and you're denying yourself the value of letting it appreciate.  Other instruments exist that are a better financial alternative.  We dont live in a vacuum where only one currency or financial instrument exists.  We have options and its about using the best options for the job.

In that case Bitcoin restores sovereignty to the people by placing the wealth into the hands of citizens and not banks.  This is more socialistic in many ways as the people then control the major means of production and distribution of wealth and not central banks who steal the wealth of citizens.
Libertarianism simply doesnt work.  It's a pipe dream to think that humans or the market operate altruistically because they have money.  I've lived in one of the few places in the world that has privatized local government and they ended up stealing all the wealth of the citizens and going bankrupt.  2-3 corrupt individuals at the top of these pyramid scams can adversely effect the economic outcome for millions below them.  Regulation protects consumers.  Labor rights protect workers.  The absence of regulation imbues corporations with power based solely on wealth and with that power they work to undermine and strip the rights of the citizens they take advantage of through localized or national monopolies.  Then they buy the politicians in the government in order to lobby for their own self-interests.
The libertarian ideals espoused in fictional books like The Fountainhead are filled with naive fantasies that have never been reflected in the world we live.  Man is inherently corrupt, especially when imbued with power.  Ethics and morals are the first things we sacrifice for money.

The security and its deflationary nature is driving that use case. 
It can be used for normal transactions, it’s just a stupid idea to do so at the moment.   Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.  As I had stated earlier any deflationary currency should be held.  It’s the inflationary currency you should spend because it’s losing value the longer you hold it.

It’s proven already to be a store of value that also has the properties of currency.  If you store your value in gold to hedge against inflation you have to convert it to fiat which can take days. You can spend BTC as currency without having to pay a broker for conversion or waiting for closing and transfer it in less time than it takes to wire money.

It is absolutely true.  Without knowing the exchange price at the points of sale you are assuming a static price.  For all you know I put 3k of that 10k back into btc when you were selling it for candy because the exchange price was lower.
And me being me, I would wait for the price to be favorable to purchase my car, therefore getting more value in return.  So while you're driving a used Hyundai, I'm in a used BMW.  And I bought your .5 btc you spent on candy and the price of btc is significantly higher while the value of your cash has decreased meaning I've retained more wealth overall.

Dude, you're totally ridiculous.  We're not talking personal fulfillment here, we're talking about mainstreaming a technology within the framework of an existing economy and the challenges of regulation by local governments that can inhibit commercial development.
If you're building a startup to try and mainstream adoption the only way you're going to be able to be successful is if you're not running afoul of the regulations governing the type of business you run.  Otherwise you can be shut down and thrown in jail.  This would inhibit mainstream adoption and push the technology to the fringe.  In regards to Lightning Network specifically, the privacy features may pose a problem to commercial adoption because of the regulations that already exist governing KYC.  That would mean if you're trying to provide a commercial solution using Lightning, you might have to strip those very same privacy features.  Lightning Network, from the perspective of regulators, may be a no-go.  We've already seen this happen to startups in crypto.

You have no rights or economy without the government, the courts, the cops, the ports, the roads and the other infrastructure.  Business development doesnt happen without them.  Look at countries all across Africa if you want to see what economies looks like when there are no stable governments, courts, cops, ports, roads or other infrastructure.
Labor is the next industry being replaced by technology.
I'm not "so off" I simply live in the real world and understand what it means to scale a commercially regulated business that can actually pull off mainstream adoption and how the government can either facilitate that process or restrict it.  For Bitcoin or crypto to be successful, we need to dance with the devil or it stays on the fringes.

Venezuela has been under direct attack by US intelligence for over a decade.  There were 6 failed coup attempts when Chavez was in charge before they finally got him.  The response to nationalize oil production and kick out US oil companies is what started this whole ball rolling.  Then the US sanctioned the shit out of Venezuela which actually strangled the economy.  Chavez was undercutting OPEC oil prices and selling oil as cheap as $8 a barrel.
The truth is this has nothing to do with socialism, which was a response to US style capitalism which was basically keeping Venezuela's economy impoverished since the 1960s because they wanted the oil.  It's been a pawn on the grand chess board for at least half a century.

We need an elected official to write and prepare and present a formal amendment with the right to privacy and then get it through both chambers and ratified.  This is not an easy feat and there will be a lot of opposition against it, but if you can organize a campaign that leverages the majority of constituents to hound their representatives you could probably pull it off.  Adding an amendment is no easy solution, so the preferred tack is legislating and regulating actors in the space (Google, Facebook etc) as opposed to trying to ratify a new amendment to the Constitution.  On the plus side, the targets of regulation, namely the companies, would probably be more apt to support the amendment than regulation targeted specifically at them unless it threatened their business models.

They define and regulate which businesses can operate within their borders.  They are a necessary component for business creation because they enforce code of laws, uphold IP rights, provide security and fund infrastructure.  They have the ability to improve adoption (through favorable regulation) or to restrict it to a black market (unfavorable regulation).

It's not protected by the bill of rights.  The right to privacy is an implied, not explicit right, under the 4th amendment.  We actually need a formal right to privacy.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:46:34
It doesnt protect the air above your property (drones and satellites are a completely legal method of surveillance).  It doesn't protect the capture of data from third parties (social media companies, insurance, medical institutions, credit card companies) or signals interception (internet, phone, etc).  The right to privacy is not specifically enumerated, it is implied and therefore up to legal interpretation based on the needs of the government or law enforcement.  Certain provisions completely obliterate the right to privacy as understood under the 4th amendment (patriot act, AML laws) due to suspicion of financial crimes or terrorism or funding terrorism or simply associating with someone who is connected to a suspected terrorist.
Sadly, in America, we give those rights away by simply hitting the "I Agree" button on a companies terms and conditions.  It'd be infinitely harder for the government to get a search warrant for every single American they suspected of terrorism, so they just go to the providers and sweep up their entire set of data.

If there is no gain or loss in an instant conversion, there's no capital gains as far as I understand.
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:42:40
We're heading towards a multicoin environment where instant conversions at point of sale will be the norm.  Even if there is slippage and it takes 15 minute to convert the price movements wont add up to more than a couple of pennies of gain or loss on capital gains for a $100 bag of weed.  Collecting the data is a pain but a spreadsheet can automate that process making it less of a headache than you are building it up to be.
Now, the person paying with bitcoin might have their own headache to deal and that is its own issue that needs to be tackled by lobbying governments for favorable regulations of bitcoin and crypto used for day to day transactions in general.  Maybe that's as simple as saying all transactions with an equivalent value under $1,000 is treated differently than a whale cashing out his bags for tens of thousands of dollars at a crack.

Billions in bitcoin can be dirty and still transferred without any interference by the big banks.  Now if there's an investigation in a country against the holders of those coins and they have evidence it was obtained illegally, thats a legal matter.  I understand the fungibility issues, but if you're carrying a briefcase of cash through an airport it will get confiscated and if you think there arent fees to launder dirty money in the first place you havent watched much TV.  You are talking about illegal activity.
I see lightning using LTC as quicker way to settle transfers and all the conversions between various currencies being a background operation.  I think LTC has its place in an integrated crypto ecosystem.
I think there are ways to obscure transaction information in bitcoin that we've seen being developed.  That could add some fungibility to the system, but a completely private coin would meet massive resistance to regulatory bodies around the world.
Privacy should have been baked in from the start, but unless you operate in 100% cash and have no bank account and use no credit or debit, all your spending is traceable already.  So to use that as an argument against bitcoin seems rather ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:05:12

You're only taxed on profit.  That's a government thing that varies based on country or state.
The price is fixed at the time the sale is made.  Whatever conversion happens in the background between providers to convert back to fiat is a separate factor.

You seem to think everything is ready for and it’s not.  I never said it was.  I realize there needs to be more development and said as much. 
If you’re paying a merchant  and eat the fees on sale the merchant can eat the fee if he chooses to refund    That’s totally up to them.  
As the space matures the volatility will smooth out.  As more front facing apps go online more people will spend and more companies and merchants will use them.  It took fifteen years to get from 300 baud modems to 56k.  Put this shit in perspective.   It wasn’t until the web browser was developed that the internet took off.

Again, those are regulatory issues set by governments that vary by state or country.  You're always paying taxes on retail purchases.
If you're reporting capital gains, you only need to pay on profits.  Losses become tax credits.   So in a real world example, if you bought some Bitcoin at $10k but spent it at $5k, you're actually getting a tax credit.
Again, you're still paying fees for service despite not having surcharges.  Those are reflected in higher retail prices because the merchant still has to pay the company with the credit card scanner, who still has to cut in Visa/Mastercard and then the aggregated service fees banks charge to administer your account.  Be that overdraft fees, higher interest on carried credit, in branch deposits, and various holds on deposits or other forms of payments for transactions to process and clear.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:44:31
I didn’t say it was ready for daily transactions on small purchases. This was a conversation about fees paid fir traditional POS providers charging a flat 1-2% on every transaction plus a surcharge in some countries   That the surcharge alone can be 10% of the purchase price on a $3.50 cup of coffee. Then there’s the percentage that the merchant eats to a service provider to accept debit or credit.  My argument was the fees for a bitcoin transaction of similar amounts would be far less as a percentage purchase amount. 
I then said that in its current state bitcoin fills a niche of moving large sums at a low fee securely and more quickly than traditional banks.  That this is something it can exploit today.  
You decided to then talk about taxes and other regulations and get lost in the weeds.  
Its not ready for everyday consumer retail usage and I never said it was. 
As far as immutability that protests the merchant, who, if ethical, can refund the money and eat the fee just like he can reverse a credit card charge.   He just doesn’t have to expose himself to fraudulent purchases.  He doesn’t have to pay a percentage to a pos provider.  He receives the value immediately without the liability of holding cash or getting denied payment from processors. Ultimately he’s saving money.  If he does $2,000 a day in business that could be $1,200 in additional profit every month.  
Prices go up because of inflation.   It’s not fixed. Those rates change as a result of many factors like wages, cost of oil, transportation, etc.  They can be effected by tariffs and trade restrictions or sudden drops in supply.  The central bank can change interest rates to try and heat up or cool down an economy, more specifically the cost of borrowed money and that has absolutely nothing to do with the price of bitcoin.  The cost of energy could impact bitcoin though.  But again it’s a deflationary asset and that means its price in relation to whatever local fiat currency you’re using will rise over time as adoption increases.
I never said bitcoin was ready for global payments. I said it’s still functional and can be used in that way but its not an ideal use case in its current state of development.

Yes, a tax credit.  It's a reportable loss.  Most bitcoiners have accumulated coins at various price points.  Your average cost per bitcoin might be less than $1,000, but if you bought a little bit at $10k and then sold it when the price dropped to $5k, that's not a taxable event based on FIFO.  That's a tax credit.  At the end of the day you're still up on your overall earnings, you're just taking advantage of the tax regulations.  Again THIS IS A REGULATORY ISSUE SET BY GOVERNMENTS.
A merchant might have financial incentive to lower prices using bitcoin.  If he wants to accumulate a deflationary asset because its price will rise, or for the fact he's saving the percentage he pays a traditional point of sale provider for having the ability to process credit or debit cards.  They dont have to worry about chargebacks or fraud as all transactions are final.  I've seen many merchants offer discounts if you pay in crypto.  Banks wont vaporize and you seem to continue painting in black and white terms.  All merchants have to pay for insurance and security and service fees to offer these payment options to customers.  I live in the real world where some merchants are happy to cut out the fees of credit and debit and accept cash or crypto.
If you're such a great and successful businessmen I wouldnt have had to make the argument that the prices go up as a result of the fees getting passed to consumers.  It should have been self-evident so the fact you ignored makes your entire argument disingenuous.
I never made the argument BTC is going to turn the world into a cheaper place.  It was to compare the fees of using each service based on a percentage of the purchase price to compare apples to apples.  The percentage you pay for BTC is less than credit.  The merchant also doesnt have to eat the 1-2% service fee to get the cash up front when processed by a credit or debit provider.

Then merchants have to make it up by increasing retail prices.  Think of all the parties involved with a simple retail transaction, you, the merchant, the pos provider, visa/mastercard, your bank and their bank.  There's fees getting paid to move that through and those costs invariably get passed to the consumer through price increases or surcharges.

I'm not being doom and gloom.  I'm saying the majority of items purchased will be gift cards, abstractions of value exchanged for cash.  That we already live in a tokenized economy where something like bitcoin is a superior instrument to use in lieu of other tokenized instruments like corporate gift cards.  The other stuff simply points out why bitcoin is superior because you cant rob it from a central location, the underlying issuer of the asset cant default or the corporation youve exchanged that value with cant go bankrupt.

You can still report the transaction for legal protection.  If you’re buying bitcoin mining machines from China and use bitcoin as the method of payment and report it you’re not going to get sued.    You’re not breaking the law in that context.  You already have to report for customs on the product coming back. It’s legit. Only people doing illegal shit have to worry. 
I’m pretty sure governments can take plenty of regulatory actions to stop privacy coins from having viable on-ramp and off ramps.   They can’t stop grey or black market activity but they can quash any kind of wide scale adoption pretty easily.  The challenges to grow usage and claim it’s secure and decentralized enough to withstand attacks over something like bitcoin would be nothing short of Herculean.  If you think the government stands idle to people avoiding taxes you’re delusional not me.

No, the credit card or debit cards are not free.  You're paying exponential fees on smaller purchases when there is a flat fee of $.35 to $.50 to use debit or credit.  Then the merchant is also taking a 1%-2% hit to get the expedited payment from credit card companies.  When you withdraw from an out of network ATM, many people are paying $1.50-$2.50 on a $20 withdrawal.  Banks will charge a premium, in many cases a flat fee of $80 plus a percentage for transfers that occurs within a day.  BTC is infinitely cheaper than all of them, and can deliver the funds faster and more securely but theres still a transaction fee for the network.  If you can pay directly in bitcoin, that service fee will be lower than a credit card or currency conversion to a local currency.
The whole idea that credit cards and debit cards are cheaper or free on smaller transactions is ridiculous when you really look at it.  You're paying huge fees when you break them down to percentages of the total transaction price.

I dont think the current regulatory environment makes bitcoin the preferred choice for smaller transactions, but to think credit or debit is "free" shows a serious lack of insight into how those payment systems are monetized.  Bitcoin's transaction and mining fees are better suited to moving large sums of money securely and more quickly than traditional banks.  That's a niche Bitcoin is perfect for in its current state of development.
When you break down the fees for transactions, at least here in the US, people are paying upwards of 10% in service fees to buy a cup of coffee on credit or debit.  It's about the percentage of the fee compared to the transaction price.  You'll see those charges are significantly higher.  The fact still remains as a percentage of the overall transaction bitcoin is cheaper when it comes to network fees.  Compare the retail prices youre paying to other markets where there are fees.  Compare your VAT to local taxes.  I guarantee you that even though Im getting raked in fees, I'm stlll paying less for the same price at retail.  Your VAT alone is like 20%.
I'm not advocating for bitcoin to be used in smaller transactions in its current state.  You invest and hold deflationary assets.  
Fungibility is also an issue I feel needs addressing.  That doesnt mean I don't think the system is functional and fills niches and will improve over time with more development.

No, it's not a viable question.  We spend more energy watching the Kardashians or playing Call of Duty on game consoles.  Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket compared to those things.

@_date: 2018-07-05 22:28:56
It's both.  It's still a viable means of payment but because its deflationary people dont want to spend it.  I know a lot of investors that hedge in gold also buying bitcoin for the same exact reasons.  I could still buy a house or a car with my bitcoin.  At this point it doesnt make sense for buying candy bars with the volatility which should smooth out over time and with increased adoption.  There's still a lot of improvement that is going to be made in the future and its the equivalent of using Apple shares in 1980 to buy a cup of coffee.

There is no possible way for you to win this argument.


I'm saying allowing Milo to use the platform exposes them to risk and they have a right to deny him service based on his speech and his supporters causing violence being a risk to their business.  There are other platforms.  His rights are still in tact.


Well, yes, libertarianism was originally a progressive movement that focused more on the civil liberties part along with sensible economic policies.  As far as the free market, liberals in general have supported free trade and free markets since the 1990s.  This is an example of the free market regulating itself. The argument is completely sound.  You dont have a counter argument when you keep insisting this is censorship.


Comet Pizza Parlor.  Three bullets fired.  Directly cited Infowars reporting on Pizzagate.  The other commoanilites with the recent mosque, synagogue and church shootings is that they were white nationalist right wing extremists, the common factor between both Alex Jones and Milo.  This extremist speech is the risk.  Again, this isnt a court of law, risk doesnt need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.


I've been posting nothing but facts.  You're the one that can only bring one example of a liberal shooting, where a guy very specifically targeted a white supremacist member of Congress and not an entire church or synagogue or mosque full of innocent people.
You're the one that has failed to provide any proof or a counter argument as to why the government should regulate Facebook, Twitter and Coinbase for refusing to do business with extremist right wing ideologues.
The  threat to domestic security is domestic terrorism.  You got nothing for that than a reference to a conspiracy about 911.  You refuse to address the mass shootings by right wing extremists over the last 3 years or the protesters theyve killed in Charlottesville, Portland and other places.  They pose a risk, not to just to the public in general, but to any businesses that associate with them or facilitate in their fundraising.  They dont have to provide service and the government sure as hell has no business forcing them to.

A business distancing itself from controversial political figures that espouse extremist language that leads to mass shootings and domestic terrorism is way different than discrimination against a citizen solely for being gay.  One is a tangible threat, the other is simply discrimination in violation of the law and the business license they signed.  
There is tangible risk to the businesses supporting donations or fundraising or personalities that advocate violence and those businesses have a right, sometimes even a fiduciary responsibility, to mitigate risks to their business.  The baker cant prove that serving gay people violates his freedom of religion or threaten his business.  Them being gay doesnt have any effect on his ability to worship whatever God he wants and if anything, serving them improves his bottom line.

It's completely consistent.  When issues of public safety or consumer protection are at play and corporations are breaking the law, they should be regulated.  If they choose to not do business with people or organizations, that doesnt threaten anyones safety or put anyone at risk or violate the law.  That's a business decision done for fiduciary reasons.


In the bakers case the couple was discriminated against solely for being gay.  Not for political rhetoric that leads to violent action.  Under the business license that baker signed, they said theyd serve the public without discrimination.  They were discriminated against solely for being gay and the baker admitted as much.


Most conservatives tried to blame liberals for the actions of a right wing nutjob that shot up a synagogue.  They dont seem to want to address the massacres caused by right wingers parroting the same rhetoric conservatives have been echoing over the last 3 years.
I was just pointing out Republicans in Texas are trying to ban abortion and wants to charge women with the death penalty if they get an abortion.  Thats just the reality.

In Coinbase's case, it's probably more about the liability of what his donors are connected to.  The last thing they need is to be connected to domestic terrorism by some right wing nutjob who donated bitcoin to Milo through Coinbase.
What those risk factors are have nothing to do with the argument.  The justification is the company has a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders and the risk is simply too high.  You'd have to ask them directly why they chose to deplatform him, but I'm sure it's probably related to all the right wing massacres taking place across the world and their associations to people like Milo and other hothead right wing ideologues.

Their board made a decision based on the financial risk.  Who cares if Milo is hated by the extreme right, he still speaks at their rallies and takes donations from people in those movements.   Sargon got deplatformed for his misogyny.  Whether the extreme right think he's a cuck is inconsequential.
 &gt; Those people commit actual crimes in real life, not just saying things you don't like online.
In Coinbase's case it's that his donor pool might be a risk.  In Facebook's case it might be the user is making other users militant and that can be a risk, especially if some kind of attack happens by one of those followers that uses the platform to try and promote it.
It's that Milo, as a controversial speaker, invites these kind of crazies to follow him and fund him and the risk is in those associations.  We've already had multiple massacres by right wingers who seem to have come to their conclusions through rhetoric pushed by guys like Milo and Alex Jones.

For as many failings as the current economy has, leaving the gold standard freed up money we could use for expansions of industries, borrowing against future earnings, and helped the economy grow exponentially in a way it simply could not do on the gold standard.
The gold standard failed over and over again throughout the ancient world.  They basically had to keep hitting the reset button and clear all debts for it to function again after a certain point.

The truth is, while the fiat system is imperfect, it led to scalar growth from the 1930's until now.  War is expensive and we cant keep borrowing and expecting to grow, but the fact of the matter is fiat economics accelerated economic development, most especially in post war environments.  That is kind of what made the US a super power in the aftermath of WWII.
Both systems have flaws and lead to inequalities between the haves and have nots.  Wealth aggregates to the top in both system.  Both systems are completely unsustainable over time.  The truth is we need entirely new economics and bitcoin doesnt address that because it relies on the perpetuation of a supply and demand based economy and will not be effective in a post scarcity environment.

That is what is written in the Constitution.  Any persons within our borders is guaranteed the right to due process.  Thats the 14th amendment right there.  Go look it up.
They cannot be illegal until determined by a court of law.  This is commonly called the rule of law.  You cant uphold the law by breaking it at the same time.  You need to go through the right process, not shortcut or sidestep it, or the Constitution becomes meaningless.
This administration continually violates the Constitution.  They even deployed border patrol agents inside our borders to demand proof of citizenship from spanish speaking citizens, another violation of the 4th amendment protecting citizens against warrantless searches and seizures.  Those are actual gestapo tactics because not only are you not required to carry proof of citizenship, you cant be detained and searched for simply being of hispanic descent, there needs to be probable cause and speaking spanish does not meet the requirement.
You keep trying to say I'm the fascist, yet you're the guy supporting an administration that has used DHS, Border Patrol and ICE as their own Gestapo in flagrant violation of the Constitution.  You not understanding the Constitution is your fault, not mine.

You say I am victim blaming?  The amount of mental agility required to believe in that bullshit argument is baffling.
We didnt even bring up conviction statistics because your argument is so weak you cant actually stick to the topic.   Its clear you support the extremist elements of the right and will continue to call this censorship when its really a private company disassociating themselves from financial risk.  Nobody put a gun to Milo's head and told him he has no right to speak.  His rights are fully in tact.  Private companies have the right to distance themselves from people who bring controversial and negative attention.  They even have a fiduciary obligation to their shareholders to do it.  You call it censorship, I call it the free market.  
The irony here is the lefist is having to explain to you how this is about the free market regulating itself and obviating risk when you insist on calling it censorship and want the government to intervene  I'm not the one calling on the nanny state to save poor Milo and Alex Jones for being persecuted for saying crazy shit that ends up with people using guns to shoot up a pizza joint or mosque or synagogue, you are.

This is a great distinction to make in regard to private businesses.  The only reason Patriot Act works is because they don't have to get warrants against private citizens, they can simply sweep up the data from the company providing those citizens services and bypass the legal requirements for a warrant.  It's also how we compartmentalize deep black projects, we hide them in private companies and use proprietary trade secrets as a shield.  This is a byproduct of capitalism and how it can be used to bypass or erode our Constitutional rights.  I'm not saying it's right, but it exists.  Ironically, conservatives hate regulation of businesses unless it's regarding their hate speech.
Conservatives still use Facebook and Twitter and Coinbase.  Just the ones publishing misinformation or rhetoric that is connected to right wing nutjobs shooting up pizza parlors, synagogues and mosques is now threatening the bottom line.  No company that has to earn revenue from the public wants to associate with that or suffer the potential billions in damages from that association.

Essentially, yes, providing incentive to sweep up lower fee transactions by a slight reduction in difficulty for including them in a block.  The current system where everything is equal only provides incentive to clear the highest fees out first.  This is trying to constrain that a bit so we dont get as much congestion in the mempool and some of those lower fee transactions are getting whittled down even when the network is under a high load.
The idea of course is that miners will start to include some of those transactions because its a little easier to hash those blocks and thereby increase the efficiency of the network as a result.  Ultimately they want the block reward, not just the fees.  Otherwise it's just a pay to play network that will bias transactions.

It's not too expensive to spend the currency.  It's cheaper and more secure than the dominant fiat model.
People pay $.35 to pay with a debit card for a $3.50 cup of coffee.  They pay up to $3.00 to pull a $20 from an out of network ATM.  They get hit for a $5 surcharge to write a check online.
With side chains and on-off chain transactions Bitcoin's costs per transaction, which are already below the costs for traditional fiat, become even lower.  When you add atomic swaps and interoperable currencies, it can be leveraged down even more and provide unique utilities and services you wouldnt be able to get from any base crypto protocol.
The real development that scales a project happens in the layers built on top of the protocol.  When one on-chain transaction becomes an aggregate of 10, then 100, then 1000, then 10,000 transactions, that's scaling.

Since you're just storing encrypted keys in memory, you could create a hardware wallet with a piezo-electric crystal that maintains a charge through movement.

For the phone, manufacturers could do the same thing they did with desktop PC's by using a separate battery to provide the power that retains BIOS settings on a motherboard.  So if the phone itself is dead, its still capable of making transactions because that function is powered by another power source.

The most secure place to have funds is on the bitcoin blockchain.  Each confirmation hardens those funds and makes them more secure.  You can still forget your pin, misplace your seeds and get hacked but that of course is all on the end user.  That being said, a lot needs to be done to make the process of setting up and using wallets securely more user friendly.  This will most likely happen as the space develops and bitcoin and other crypto becomes more mainstream.

Would making the difficulty rate be variable based on block composition help smooth out the memory pool?
For instance if miners are just choosing to process the highest fees, the difficulty should be higher because the reward is greater.  But if the difficulty could be lowered by sweeping up a percentage of the lower fee transactions it could provide incentive to start pushing those transactions through as well.
I'm not a coder or anything but I'm thinking if this difficulty rate could be adjusted based on how miners are constructing blocks we could smooth out some of the congestion.

Corporations arent people.  They are legal business entities meant to produce profit for shareholders.  They should be regulated in the places they do business based on existing laws.  This is for the protection of employees and citizens who have rights under the Constitution.  Corporations are legal entities owned by a collection of shareholders and they have a legal fiduciary responsibility to produce profit for those shareholders.  That means disassociating with unsavory businesses or ideologies because it poses a threat to profitability.
There is nothing inconsistent with those positions.  Free speech is still in tact.  These are platforms owned by private companies, you have no Constitutional right to use them.  They provide an elective service you choose to use.  There are other vendors and platforms to choose from.
This is the FREE MARKET regulating itself, largely in financial self-interest.  Maybe the financial risk of Milo's donors being connected to right wing nutjobs shooting up synagogues is too great and Coinbase would rather eliminate the risk of even being tangentially connected to potential domestic terrorism or at very least rhetoric that brings negative attention, PR and ultimately financial risk to the platform.
Conservatives:  Dont you dare allow big government to regulate the oil company fracking in my backyard and contaminating the water supply.

Yes, conservatives are trying to selectively strip the rights of gay citizens when they pass laws that legalize discrimination based on religious objections.  They want to be able to treat gays, or muslims, or other minorities differently than other citizens.  These laws of course get overturned when going through the court system for being unconstitutional but they keep getting passed across the country in conservative states.
I'm glad you believe they have the full rights granted under the Constitution.  Because conservatives on the whole have supported the idea and legislation that people can discriminate against other citizens because of their sexuality or their gender identification or their religion.
This devolved from a point about bakers denying a cake to a couple because they were gay.  I never made the point about gender or gays in the first place.  Some idiot decided to make an issue about bi sexuals and binary genders as if it mattered in the first place, I guess because he was generalizing "all liberals" and couldnt specifically communicate what the "logical inconsistency" is in believing all citizens are granted the equal protection of the laws regardless of gender identity, sexuality, race, religion or any other factor.  Its very consistent to say a citizen is a citizen is a citizen and they are guaranteed the equal protection of the laws.  That's how it's written in the Constitution.
Efforts to deny gays from marriage would be treating them unequal under the law.  Efforts to legalize discrimination against gay citizens based on a business owners religious objections violate equal protection.  These are core conservative issue and they are inconsistent based on your expressed believe that all citizens have rights under the Constitution.

They should provide equal service to any person.


Companies are required to provide service to all citizens equally as part of their business license.  The key difference in the cake situation is they were being discriminated against solely for being gay, ostensibly over religious objection.  The irony is the freedom of religion is supposed to protect from discrimination based on religion. They are simply trying to live their lives and buying a cake just like any other patron in the store.  They didnt do anything to cause themselves to be discriminated against other than being gay.


A citizen is a citizen, their gender identity doesnt really matter.  You've got some issues with this whole gender thing dont you?  Personally I get confused by all that stuff too but people are people and its none of my goddamn business in the first place.


You've lost any point you were trying to make.  If you like dudes and chicks, right on brother your chances at getting laid have risen exponentially.


I dont care that you dont agree with me.  A private service deplatforming a user isn't censorship. Milo and Alex Jones can still spout all the bullshit they want, just not through those particular services.  These businesses are choosing to separate themselves from the risk of association with militant right wingers known to spread disinformation that leads to violent crime.  This is way different from discriminating against someone and denying them service solely because they are gay, this was done with cause based on prior actions and the risk it posed to business.

I assume it applies to ANY group that advocates violence.  Anti abortion organizations that blow up abortion clinics or assassinate doctors should be "in with the banned" as well.  There are plenty of non-violent organizations that are pro-life, pro-Islamist or progressive in nature.  By Any Means necessary isnt bitching about being deplatformed or looking for sympathy.  Milo advocated for murdering journalists.


Based on the evidence, yes.  How many people have been murdered by militant lefitsts in the last 3 years?  Can you even name any?


Yes, the damage has resulted in hits to their bottom line, especially in Facebooks case where users fled the platform and advertiser pulled ads.


It's not censorship.  Nobody is physically stopping them from spouting their bullshit.  They just arent letting people use their equipment to do it.  Big difference.  They arent necessarily in trouble for their censorship, they are in trouble for providing and selling private information.


The context matters and was clearly different.  She was not advocating violence as much as her comments were taken out of context.


Once again, who escalated the violence to shooting guns and driving cars into crowds of people?  Leftists havent killed anyone at these rallies.  Only the right wingers have.


When he advocated for murdering journalists.  Catch up dude.  This is about the rhetoric he spouts, the donors hes connected to and the risk, there's no burden of proof required here.  There just needs to be tangible risk.  I'm not here to prosecute Milo for being an opinionated asshole, he simply is.


Show me moderate conservatives getting deplatformed.  Not a bunch of racist misogynists that advocate violence.


There's a connection in the fact their rhetoric has been connected to violence and is, pardon the pun, Trump-eted by the right wing.
The guy fired three rounds in Comet Pizza Parlor.  So yes, he fired THREE TIMES then gave up.  Again, just last week a mosque was gunned down by an extreme right winger.  We keep seeing continued instances of extremist right wingers, including chuckleheads taking over federal property by gunpoint.  Right wing extremism is so bad in this country it's labelled the  threat to domestic security.  That alone is enough risk to cause companies to disassociate.   I can keep straight which violence has happened and the ideologies driving them, can you?  Because it's not a bunch of left wingers gunning down mosques and synagogues and mistaking Sikhs for Muslims in America, it's extreme right wingers ginned up on misinformation and hateful rhetoric.

When the majority of domestic terror attacks over the last 3 years have been perpetrated by right wing extremists, then its way more prevalent than you're willing to admit.

We had a right wing nutjob shoot up a synagogue in San Diego just last weekend.  Did you read his manifesto?
It's full of references and talking points of the far right.  Just like the one from the New Zealand shooting,  Go read it.  There's so many mass shootings of churches and mosques and Sikh temples by ignorant right wingers I cant even possibly name them all.
Starting a race war or a war between the left and right is the goal of right wing extremists.  They literally want a war over ideologies.  They advocate violence to achieve their goals.  They are the ones killing protesters.
There's also Alex Jones and Infowars being directly attributed to the guy who shot up Comet Pizza over the Pizzagate shit.  All these mass shootings over the past 3 years have been predominantly right wing extremists.  Even the FBI says the biggest threat to the country is right wing domestic terrorism.
So there is plenty of information which shows right wing extremism is a serious threat, not just to public safety, but also to a company's bottom line by association.

You forgot (c) make the country and it's resources collateral to the debt and run it like a payday loan lender where you squeeze them over and over again to give you every drop of blood.  And then you raid their bank deposits and force the country to adopt your political and economic agenda or face imminent economic collapse.  At least that's what they did to Greece.  I'd imagine the deal is much more raw in Africa or South America than in the cradle of western civilization.

Actually, yes, we have to.  Its required by law.  That is what makes America different than other countries is the rule of law.  If any person is in our borders they are guaranteed the right to due process and the equal protection of the laws.  I've shown this to you multiple times.  Its the damn Constitution.
I'm not saying they have a right to apply for citizenship for just being here.  I'm saying they have a right to appear before a judge to plead their case.

The people donating to him could be connected to militant nationalist groups.  The last thing Coinbase needs is to have any kind of connection to a gun massacre.


That's because the last place he spoke it caused a riot.  Remember that?  I dont really follow the dude.  You seem intimately more aware of the extreme right than I do.  How do I know who donates to him?  I don't in particular know, but there would definitely be implied risk associated with the people that do donate to him based on the use of violence by right wingers and riots at some of his speeches.


When you become bad for business, guess what?  You're bad for business.  See ya.  Remember the legal fiduciary responsibility of the business.


A risk of being connected to donors that also support right wing militancy and it becoming a news story or a meme that produces a headline like "COINBASE FACILITATES DOMESTIC TERRORISM".  That's kind catchy, doncha think?


I would try to list that out but the pile keeps getting bigger.  They're getting regulated and hauled before Congress all over the place, they just set aside billions of dollars to settle lawsuits and theres still stuff coming over Cambridge Analytica's bullshit.  Facebook is under siege for all their fuckery in general.


There was that one time he said he couldnt wait for right wingers to gun down journalists.  There was the riots at some of his speeches.  He's advocated for violence.  He's been a demonstrative part of the alt-right.  Who cares if Alex Jones praised or endorsed Milo?  He's just as bonkers and we already saw someone walk into a pizza parlor and start shooting up the place.

Argentina's economy buckled after Brazils tanked.  Thats a ripple effect from a global economy.
They are also a constitutional republic with a capitalist economy that was deregulating and privatizing services.  The completely opposite end of the spectrum from the marxist fantasy youve cobbled together in your head.
That IMF loan kept them impoverished for almost 20 years until they paid off the hedge funds and vulture capital firms that were feasting on their misery.

Who exactly is Antifa but some amorphous boogeyman the right props up to distract from all the mass shootings their followers are involved in?
Antifa isnt even a formal organization.  There is By Any Means Necessary and some other groups, but they arent bitching about being deplatformed because they dont use those platforms.
How many protesters did "Antifa" kill?  The answer is none.  You're simply trying to deflect.
Now when you want to talk about the right wing extremists shooting up churches, synagogues and sikh temples because they're so retarded they cant tell the difference between a Sikh and a Muslim, let me know.

I already explained the context about this being a free speech issue and how it relates to the Constitution.
Again, you lack context.

That kind of inhibits mass adoption, dont you think?  If it cant find a way to acceptability by the larger global market it'll just be an interesting side project.
