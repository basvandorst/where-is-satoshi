DAE le ent?
Fuck I'm gold.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:07:24
This is always the correct answer.

OP, this is an excellent post. Top notch.
I'd love to discuss this with the community but I'm not sure what you're ultimately arguing here. What's your conclusion?
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:23:44
Ironically enough, the surfing is actually worse.
Go figure.

I don't understand how more computing power would equal less reward... Elaborate?

I found myself in a gov't office earlier today. The day before, I was in a bank handing over all the cool new benjies I'd collected to a lady who told me what I couldn't do with them now, and how much of them they were taking, and how much more they would take if I didn't follow the rules.  
So there I was at the DMV updating paperwork and verifying shit, proving I'm me to people I don't want knowing that in the first place. I didn't fill out the email portion on the paperwork. It was required but I guess no one noticed or cared. I'm being told to destroy any documents contradicting the information I'm surrendering or I could get in trouble. Yeah I'll get right on that :)
I've intentionally avoided dealing with these people for a few years now, as soon as we reunited I remembered why.
So I'm in the lobby waiting to get into the waiting line where I can finally start waiting. I started thinking about how much I hate red tape, how much I've enjoyed hiding from these people, how much I hate complying with restrictions that are clearly designed against me, and being nickel and dimed to death. That's when the true beauty of bitcoin really dawned on me.
**I'm almost free.** 
I immediately started grinning ear to ear when I realized the freedom and simplicity of bitcoin. It's potentially an economic perpetual motion machine. It feeds off of it's own shit in the most efficient way. Some people make money from the art they've created, but Satoshi has made art from the money he created. It's truly brilliant. Arguably the most innovative idea since the invention of currency.
I must have been the only person smiling in there. I chuckled to myself every now and then. I got cheeky with the lady at the counter. She said she wasn't having a great day because they were so busy, I asked if she was at least making good tips. I chatted with strangers I passed for the rest of the day, even got a few laughs.
Nothing I used to stress about matters anymore because I'll soon be a part of something much, much bigger and more beautiful than American life. This must be what finding god feels like.
I might lose my life savings, and if I did I could still laugh about it. I'm proud to become a part of the world's largest middle finger to everything I hate.

There's plenty of competition outside of these subs. We stand to gain more by trading together.

Thank goodness I just set up my Coinbase account. 
Will wire cash **right now** for 1 BTC. Please PM me.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:22:20
Lol no. Updating, verifying, consolidating, etc. all of my personal info that I've been keeping divided and inaccurate thus far and depositing the cash I've been storing.
Paying the Man, basically.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:00:29
Ah ok. Yeah we're on the same page. Nothing is ever truly secure, that's why I advocate diversifying everything. It only takes a few minutes to do, it's free, and in the event of the unthinkable it could easily save you from ruin. Unfortunately most of my peers don't see private data the way I do.
Here's how I put it to them: If you don't think there's any value in your own private data, find out how much other companies are willing to pay someone for it. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:07:41
Vulnerability is always more convenient than security.
Case in point: I just picked up some malware through a gmail vulnerability this morning. It's fairly new and extremely easy to get. I just posted about it in If all my accounts were linked, I'd be hella fucked. If I was online banking with those accounts, you might as well stick a fork in me. Hell, I'd do it for you.
Keeping with the investment theme, storing all of your personal data in the same place is the equivalent of not diversifying your portfolio. Don't sync all your e-eggs to the same iBasket.

BTC has been surprisingly stable this week. Even experienced traders will find it difficult to speculate right now.
If anyone "knows", they sure as hell ain't sharin'
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:59:31
No offense OP but you'll need to do some work for me. Add a tl;dr to your text because no one is going to read entire threads for you without even knowing what they're about.
Or you can just reply to this comment and tell me why we should give a fork.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:22:54
Right, so they may very well have been mining this whole time. Why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2013-11-15 11:56:18
Completely agree. Can't imagine why a single person in the game would feel otherwise. Kinda defeats the whole purpose.
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:23:49
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:56:43
What makes you think they haven't been mining since day 1?
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:44:19
Bitcoin is the exception.
Still yet, people are storing their funds in multiple hot and cold wallets created from multiple computers and IPs. Anything of value shouldn't be stored in one place. Ask coca-cola, or mankind in general.

That's because they have great PR. PPlus they always use white backgrounds and blue buttons.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:57:09
Still fake.

$35k? Really? How?
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:48:14
Chrome. 
I googled about it and only 5 results were retrieved. 2 were omitted, 1 was a reddit post from yesterday that I'll link as soon as I can find it on my phone.
**The earliest result was from 2 days ago**. This is thing is brand new.
Had details and screencaps up on my pc but she's now completely defunct. 
On mobile, updates coming soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:21:59
Seems legit
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:28:55
So you're trolling the blockchain looking for... a username called "Google"?
I assume you didn't find one. So, cased closed I guess. Good work. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:52:33
Ah, ok. Thanks man
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:41:13
I'm sorry, I thought your prior comment was sarcasm. We agree.
My apologies for the attitude.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:32:53
I'm sure they will. I'm sure plenty of big time investors will. This market just exploded so there's no reason to spend money on hype until demand goes down. Lots of factors come together to determine the best marketing forecast.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:01:03
How exactly do you create the cold wallet without connecting to the internet?
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:36:11
Hey, I'm new here. 
I haven't seen this type of chart before, do the blue bars represent how many BTC were mined during that hour?
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:54:30
You're way too knowledgeable and concise to be just some redditor.
PM me, shill. Lets fight.
