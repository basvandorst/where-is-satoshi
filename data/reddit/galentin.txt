~29 split over about 15 adresses. I keep ~1btc in a hot wallet, the rest is deep cold storage.

A lot of people use the analogy of the Internet in its early days. As ease of use goes, we're still at the stage of gopher and working or way to http.
Don't worry about what blockchain.info says, they tend to be delayed (though,  not always). There are other block explorers. I like blockr, but again you're going to a third party and subject to delays. 
 Odds are, your btc was sent, but the site may be waiting for x number of confirmations before they allow you to use it.  The other possibility is your client isn't properly synced. 
As for sending it to the other person,  it is that simple. There are different wallets and some are ultra use friendly, others are not.  For low value stuff I keep a small amount on my phone with mycelium. For high value I use bitcoin armory cold storage style..though that may not be user friendly for ya.

Not at all what I meant.  You shouldn't send from the same address over and over. Inputs aren't vulnerable to this, only outputs are. You can post a public address as much as you like with no worries. However when you spend from it you should empty it.

I think you did good he only lost $5 and that's a pretty cheap price to learn a valuable lesson.  Explain to him how the responsibility comes with complete control of your coins. Show him how lucky he is in comparison to those who have lost small fortunes from simple mistakes. Then start him off again with $5 and set him up with a method of exchange and see what he's really learned in time.

51% gives you a slim chance at a double spend, it would be immediately noticed, and it would probably fail anyway. It would take timing down to the second -and- the other party in the transaction not waiting for confirmation. Not sure how this would destroy confidence, but hey if they want to buy a few billion and skyrocket the price while trying, please let them.

It's like reinventing the wheel in my opinion. We have cold storage methods that work well. I have 5 encrypted copies of my private key... grand total cost: .05 BTC for the 5 keys.

Seems like you have it backwards. Merchant adoption (when speaking of companies that convert immediately to USD or other fiat) puts a downward pressure on the market.

Use armory to read armory backups. Do keep in mind they recently changed the format to support multi sig. So you should use the same version you made the backup with. 
Armory isn't directly compatible with other wallets because it backs up a seed that let's you create wallets offline. It's not just a single wallet but rather is a seed to make many wallets.

I still mine with my 5gh/s bfl. Sure it doesn't turn a profit,  but I can't bare to see it lifeless. Plus I'm on a local p2pool node so I'm doing my part to secure the network and all that jazz. ..... it's also a bit of a conversation piece,  guests always ask "what's that thing? " which of course leads into the bitcoin rabbit hole.

Just great.  We'll go from being those crazy people who talk about bitcoin to those crazy people flailing their arms about while talking about bitcoin.

Yeah, I admit it was a stretch, but seeing the "B" on the bee car beast boy drove around in, couldn't resist seeing similarities in the story.

you can't be serious? goods that ship are tied to a physical address. bitcoin isn't. at this point you either enjoy comparing apples to oranges or you're just a troll.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:50:53
How would they know when they don't yet support bitcoin. They've made an announcement with vague plans but no release yet.

Really? I'm not up on their episode order, but I did search for "teen titans" before I posted and found nothing. Maybe it's just hated by some and not "universally". Also a quick search shows it was originally aired on April 2nd 2015, so not that old.

My personal arrangement is through the use of USB keys and very trusted friends that don't know about each other. One has an encrypted copy of my private key for my "savings" wallet and the other contains a message that I know will lead my heir to the correct password. 
This has the obvious flaw of trusting 2 parties that could at some point meet and figure it out. But as I said they are people I trust. They both have instructions to do nothing with the keys until I'm dead and my heir turns 18.
I'm planning to switch this idea out for encrypted multi sig keys at some point,  but this plan has been in place for over a year now. I've swapped out keys once so far to cycle into a new wallet. but that's about it.

No target, still buying what I can afford to lose. When the time comes, I won't need fiat, I'll just spend from my btc savings. Which btw,I consider my btc a form of savings account, not a standard investment so I don't really plan to be in and out at the markets whim. Just letting what happens happen. 
 I figure if we ever hit $100k USD per BTC I might buy something nice, but I wouldn't use all my holdings.

Not sure about the vertical, but I'm pretty confident (although not 100%) that the chart will continue to move to the right.... we'll see in time.

I prefer to use localbitcoins but I also use the mycelium app buy/sell thing. Be careful using eBay or anything where the buyer could contest the charges and generate a charge back to you. I prefer to deal in cash.

Quite the opposite, there's a public ledger of every transaction, ever. So if you can be associated with an address then anything you do with it is public. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 05:19:29
Oh the irony of googling "iOS" anything...
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:31:08
As I mentioned, No. Not possible. As with or without a password, a public address on the public ledger will show balance.

And coinbase is an exchange. If you're using it as a bank you're doing it wrong.

Maybe you do crazy stuff like that. I on the other hand do not trust third parties with access to my funds. That's why it's funny.

I'd do a 2-of-3 multi-sig for her. Let her have a key that makes her happy, keep a key for yourself to co-sign legit transactions, have her put the 3rd key in a safe deposit box never to be on a computer unless something happens to one of you.
@_date: 2015-07-17 11:54:10
No... Your method isn't possible, but your desired results are possible.
Wallets (terrible terminology in my opinion) consist of addresses. You can generate a private key without any internet connection, you can also (with math) generate the corresponding public address (also without any network/internet connection)
Once you've generated this offline key, you can go to an internet connected device with -only- the public address and send whatever btc you like to your offline created wallet. This would never expose the private (signing) key to the public. Most of us refer to this as cold storage (if you want to research it further).
You can take this a step further and repeat the process a few times and then create a multi-sig address that requires a set number of private keys in order to sign a transaction to make it valid.
I'm not going to outline all this in detail as it's been done many times, but things you may want to search on your own: "bitcoin cold storage" and "bitcoin multi-sig"
 
Hope that helps.

Let this be a lesson that physical security (of both Fiat and Private Keys) is important. Also, come on, bitcoin ATM and Analog CCTV cameras? time to upgrade that stuff.

When we get where we're going the question about USD to BTC price will be gone. Questions like "how many mBTC for that item you're selling?" Willl be more commonplace.
