Yes, I bought some, spent some and received some! It's my very first Christmas involving bitcoins!

I was using a laser printer to print on normal paper. I guess the toner will stay as long as the paper is intact.
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:43:26
I am broke... 
just empty my bank for bitcoins!! Oh wait. Maybe I am richer now!
@_date: 2014-09-23 10:37:28
Nothing will happen to bitcoin. It will only become stronger.
@_date: 2014-11-22 15:52:27
Excellent webpage! Cheers!
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:46:51
No it wasn't a mistake. 100 bits @_date: 2014-11-07 06:12:42
Thanks in advance! Cheers!
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:47:05
Thanks for sharing!

Did you go to the church today?
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:40:25
Totally agree. I actually ignore them.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:01:04
UPDATE: Thanks for all the tips. I will tip them forward!
@_date: 2014-12-25 04:04:13
Very nice one! Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:57:50
Wee! Cheers!

I guess it has reached the equilibrium between reward (price of 25 BTC) vs expenses (electricity and investment in ASIC).
Next increase will be due to a significant increase in BTC price or the launch of more efficient ASIC miners.

Hmmm... the response from China seems very slow after 3 hours...
@_date: 2014-10-16 08:44:28
I think not all characters can be recognized in the picture. Good Luck and let us know if you are successful.

Another rich man! You are very lucky!

Thanks. Will do this later in the evening. Cheers.

Came across a humor the other day...
When Adam stayed out very late for a few nights, Eve became upset. "You're running around with other women," she charged. 
"You're being unreasonable," Adam responded. "You're the only woman on earth." The quarrel continued until Adam fell asleep, only to be awakened by someone poking him in the chest. 
It was Eve. "What do you think you're doing?" Adam demanded. 
"Counting your ribs," said Eve.

Is the current price rally related to the tippings? $400 here we go!
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:36:21
Thanks for the great effort! 
100 bits @_date: 2014-11-14 11:13:48
I love cake!
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:47:01
More that 20,000 bits! Wow!
More than what I have been tipped for the past 1 year!
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:44:28
Give him sometime to digest the sushi...
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:50:40
I bought one of these. It works well for my purpose of watch videos.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

I think the price will only increase after the mining reward halving in 2016. This will cause the reduction in profit driven mining operations in China. However, after the price goes up to certain level, mining becomes profitable again, the price will stop going up until the next halving...  Very clever idea to keep the equilibrium....
@_date: 2014-10-16 08:52:26
I didn't keep any of the private keys- these coins are meant to be burnt. I guess I can still check the public keys from the transaction history in Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:10:47
Although Singapore government is very open to the development of Bitcoin and related technologies, most Singaporeans are still not aware of it. There are not many businesses accepting bitcoin yet.
Enjoy your trip and have a wonderful journey.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:25:09
Glad to hear that the coins are still there. Maybe the newest version of bitcoin-qt is not stable enough. You may consider the older versions. I am using 0.9.3.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:57:19
Changetip is almost like the first step for every newbie. 
On point to note is that the 1% withdrawal fee will be imposed on 15-January. Not sure if this is discussed anywhere, but I think lower fee (or free) will be better, especially for tipping to charity organisations.
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:47:09
Happy Tuesday! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:38:35
One suggestion:
Maybe we can have a few of the contests at one time so that it is not a single person with super computing power keep winning the quiz...
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:22:02
After re-scan, you will need to wait for the sync to be completed (it may take hours). If bitcoin-qt is not sync, you won't see all your up-to-date transaction.
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:53:06
Maybe the OP is trying to test his newly written automated tipping code?
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:54:53
Hmm... 21st of each month = pay day!
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:01:17
Sent to the next person. I am not the coinholder now....
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:02:44
Hmmm.... so that best is still yet to come?
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:34:44
Apologies just got online.
Mayotoast, please let me have your address I will send the coins back to you.
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:18:58
Still waiting for confirmation... Quite slow for this round.
EDIT1: Already tried to send to saintoshi. If received please pass to tac_bitcoin.
EDIT2: Unable to send due to unconfirmed transaction.
EDIT3: Need to go offline... Apologies... Will check the transaction when I come online again.
EDIT4: Still not confirmed after 1 hour!!

How to play?

@_date: 2015-04-07 14:13:17
Waiting for the confirmation.... I am using Rushwallet.
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:32:59
For brute-forcing the password, the second clue is quite useless- no one will know how you misspelled the "word".
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:35:07
Maybe a "lot" of bits?
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:51:41
Hmmm.... the bot didn't work. Maybe you can tip by direct transfer to 1BCC2Rg4g6PwRniBZA1exroUxCz8fsPKmA
or changetip?
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:42:07
A picture of the paper wallets may be useful!
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:03:24
Is the ones in 2013 counted?
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:23:50
Under "SHIPPING" &gt; "DELIVERY", I think there is an extra full stop/period after the word "Delivery"
*"Delivery. is usually made within 7 working days."*
@_date: 2015-03-17 05:41:06
Just realized that the address has been emptied. Has anyone found the answer? or the OP ended the test?
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:16:46
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:42:24
It works but not all the time. I guess the contrast is important...
@_date: 2015-03-14 08:28:32
How do you generate the BIP38 private key after knowing your public key?
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:55:16
Melanie, who was 5, asked her Granny how old she was. 
Granny replied she was so old she didn't remember any more. 
Melanie said, "If you don't remember you must look in the back of your panties. Mine say five to six."

Thanks for the tip, but it did not go through.

Apologies. I have my base64 encryption turned on.
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:25:42
Top 5 tipper! Wow!
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:47:48
I think it will not last long. I thought the Chinese were still sleeping when the price went up?
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:11:44
Jesus loves you!

That's 1,000,000,000 satoshis = 10,000,000 bits = 10 BTC!
Great job!
@_date: 2015-02-27 02:34:59
Maybe the other way round?
Paypal is for ebay as Bitcoin is for (eg. Overstock?)
