Really?   You're claiming Libra will actually be used by people in the future?    lol

This reminds of how priests will say whatever happens is, "God's will" regardless of whether it makes sense or not.
Time travelers work in mysterious ways, eh?   It makes sense that you'd show up in a crypto forum though.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:46:37
Why would a time traveler publicly announce what he's doing?  
How is this indistinguishable from someone trying to pump and dump?
Can you imagine a guy going back in time with winning lotto numbers and posting on reddit listing the numbers?

Is there anybody who doesn't have a lot of money/resources tied up in this that also feels the same way?

Did you read the same article that I did?
He seemed rather cold and technical in expressing what his concerns were.  I didn't take it as an "attack" as much as his analysis of what's going on with the community, with a lot of references to back it up.
So what was inaccurate about his claims?   Suggesting something is an "exaggeration" or "half truth" implies more of a subjective interpretation, and obviously anybody with anything invested in Bitcoin has an obvious conflict of interest in arguing against the legitimacy of his criticisms... 
As an outsider who is interested in this technology, it seems to me, it's hard to get some truly objective information in forums like this... people have money on the line and are unwilling to entertain weaknesses in the system and want to say there's nothing wrong.
But if even 1/5th of the problems he's cited are true, they are serious issues.  Don't you guys realize by burying your head in the sand, you're not helping your investment?
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:18:47
This is a classic example of a "red herring."
Instead of debating the cogent points the guy raises about the future of Bitcoin, you criticize the style, over the substance of his argument.
It seems obvious he has been frustrated for a long time at people not understanding the priorities necessary in keeping this system healthy.

When a major site like bitcoin.org are banning and censoring huge groups of people who are trying to solve problems inherent in the technology, *something is seriously wrong*.   You could pick any one of the dozen of legitimate criticisms levied in that article and they'd be clear grounds for acknowledging a seriously sinking ship. 
The ironic part is, if people here weren't heavily invested in the technology, they'd adamantly agree with his findings.

Isn't bitcoin supposed to be different?

96% of bitcoin is held by 4% of the wallets.

Everything changes dude.
This idea that blockchain is immutable is not reflected in reality.  All major cryptos have forked and split.  Just because the base version has more value right now doesn't mean it will stay that way in the future.
The value of crypto is completely arbitrary.  It's not backed by any tangible assets.  It's not enforced or protected from fraud and theft.  There are tons of things which are one-of-a-kind, that are worthless.
@_date: 2019-02-04 06:12:27
First, people need to decide:  Is bitcoin a currency, or an investment security?   It can't be both.  If it's going to be a currency, then it has to have stability and cannot be too inflationary or else it can't properly function as a currency.  If it's an investment security, then it has to be tied to something tangible.  Right now Bitcoin is neither.  It's an intangible token that represents the hope someone has that someone else will pay more for it.
On top of this, nobody really knows the actual value of bitcoin.   The markets are so heavily manipulating the price, it's dangerous.  The whole crypto community is a house of cards, intertwined together due to wash trading.  The reason there can't be a single crypto winner is because they all are propping each other up.  Something has to give.

There's still trust.. you have to trust in the integrity of the nodes.  That they're not hacked.

From what I've read, the kill switch stopped the virus from activating, but did not decrypt files or un-do already attacked systems.  I'm still looking for any evidence that can decrypt already held hostage systems.

Where's the details on decrypting the data?

Anything using technology to obfuscate, can be de-obfuscated using technology.  Obfuscation buys you time, not innocence.

Coordinated attack by people who are trying to get some of the value of their investment back before it dwindles to nothing.
If this were a true free market, they'd wait until I got the return I want first.

If the op really is sincere, I hope he [reads this]( for some additional insight.
If you only look at the positive reviews on Amazon, it's a crap shoot what you're going to get.

I remember when Worldcom went really low.  I thought to myself, "I'm going to buy into that dip."

Fiat is heavily regulated though.   There is no FDIC for crypto.  There is no "Fair Crypto Billing Act" like there is for the existing systems.

I don't want to defend the current financial status quo - I'm definitely against the "too big to fail" thing.  But the bank thing basically works out quite well actually.  The government actually made money in the last few bailouts.  I do think there's room for improvement though.
One of the reasons you see crazy fluctuations in things like BTC going from a few k to 20k then back down to a few k, is because lack of cushion and regulation causes markets to be much less stable and more easily manipulatable by market forces which care more about short term profit than they do long term stability.
When's the last time anybody lost their life savings sitting in a bank?  
They haven't.

This reminds me of a George Carlin joke about how foolish environmentalists were about "saving the earth".  He said, "Earth is fine.  The planet will continue to exist.  PEOPLE on the other hand, perhaps not.  The earth will shake them off like a bad case of fleas."
