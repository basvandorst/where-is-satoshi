Same ... and I'm guessing you are in same situation as me - a lot more vested in stocks.  
The %drop for stocks is peanuts compared to cryptos.
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:29:38
Sorry ... silly me.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:05:39
And giving the control to exchanges and mining farms.  
So what's your point?
@_date: 2018-05-19 00:17:03
Not holding my breath for anything.
All I'm saying is that all these optimistic predictions, whether on this forum or from "gurus" like Tom Lee, have been proven to be horse shit.
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:14:56
Lol ..... who do you think are trading on the top 10 exchanges (which are all Asia based)?
America and Europe combined is a minority.  Crypto is mostly an Asian game.
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:02:01
Weak hands?  Lol!
Given the news from DOJ, it's more likely that the whales doing manipulation who will be existing.  I'm expecting massive dumps.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:45:15
Oh?  
So saying that "Bitcoin is freedom" is not trying to force a view?
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:52:09
I lost count of the number of times I bought or short.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:07:39
The important point is not whether bitfinex is solvent.
What is more important is how much each Tether was actually sold for.  Do not forget that Tether trades are at least 4-5 times more than USD.
If it's discovered that each Tether was sold for only 10 cents, the price of BTC will collapse.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:20:44
Don't worry - I'm buying soon.
To close my shorts :) 
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:15:20
Yeah.  Someone who either can't multiple 200 x (8.2k - 7.3k) - f/t or thinks that a cheap table cost more than that.
In either case, a moron.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:53:56
Later, bro.  Good move.
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:36:49
This one from is [Gold] (
Lots of people with experience dealing with other markets think that BTC is easy to predict ..... most full of confidence and all got burnt.
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:40:08
Funny.  I see the same group here in BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:47:41
Hey kid, stop parroting marketing lines.
I can buy a teddy bear and everything you said about BTC is also true with regards to it.  Tough, not many restaurants will accept my teddy bear for a plate of pasta but I can bet that those same restaurants won't accept BTC either.
Get it?
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:16:02
What massive drop?  It's just $200.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:06:16
Well, your going around and claiming that people are making negative opinions about BTC because they 'lost money' is not good behaviour either.
I call a spade a spade.  If you don't like it, too bad.
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:30:20
For pete's sake, it's just a digital token.
Just enjoy and profit from the speculation.
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:41:25
Another monkey.
Anyway, I closed my short yesterday.  And if you think that what you or I write here on Reddit has any impact on the price, you are a moron.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:40:12
2000 wasn't just a crash, it was the collapse of the dot-com bubble.
Tech stocks spiked 10x to 20x in price, it was obviously a bubble waiting to burst.  Just like BTC :)
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:01:06
Based on?  BTC is not like a company producing profit or a commodity with real world demand or PM, which are held as national reserves.
The price is 100% based on speculation and when people stop believing in it, there is absolutely nothing to stop it from crashing to pre-2013 price ($200). 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:18:58
If it does down to 7k, there is 50/50 chance that it will go below 7k.
Dude, this is not an asset with some intrinsic value that gives it a floor value.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:39:54
Sorry, ... a spade is a spade.
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:54:16
Lol ... crypto is a rounding error where real world trading is concerned.  
And anyway, most of volume in crypto is trading on the exchanges, not spending it in the real world.
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:50:28
The point is that deflation should be the outcome of the state of the economy such as increased productivity or increased saving.
Having a currency that is deflationary by design essentially means that it is flawed and unusable.  It's like having the tail wag the dog.
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:10:58
Sorry but I very much doubt if you understand it yourself.  
So that pretty much puts you in the 'low IQ' category (per your own definition).
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:15:29
Yes ... and there were many days when it went up more than $500.
It's really no big deal.
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:25:00
Too late at this price.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:44:13
No big deal.  Fed can just print another 21 T.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:17:49
Why do you think I'm not interested in BTC?  I happen to make quite a tidy sum trading it.
I just don't believe that it will come anywhere close to replacing fiat.  You got a problem with that?
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:18:09
Of course.  That's exactly what the Fed do.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:09:24
Whatever.  Go on and live in your fantasy world.
BTC is just a computer generated number that is delivering zero value other than being speculated on exchanges.
If you think commanding thousands of dollars for it is not a bubble, no rational argument will convince you so let's close this discussion.
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:43:04
We have to take $10k first.
Which, according to your claimed ability to read the market like an old movie, WILL happen this week.  
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:05:06
Very tiny - only people left are hodlers, speculators and a couple of new suckers added occasionally.
Adoption has failed and nobody is interested to do anything about it.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:05:11
Go count it yourself
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:22:59
For the long term, yes.
In the meantime, it's a well known fact that BTC's price is artificially sustained by price manipulation.  Remove this and the price will likely crumple.  Don't know to what extent.
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:36:03
The entire crypto market is manipulated in plain sight if you open your eyes.
BTC trades using real money (fiat) accounts for only a small fraction of daily volume.  Rest are pump'ed using alts.  
You think the alt volumes are 'real' substitutes like Tether and TRUE?  Look closely:
a.  Tether - $3.8B traded in 24 hours but total Tether is only $2.4B.
b.  TRUE - $250M traded in 24 hours but total TRUE is only $65M.
These are fake wash trades to pump up BTC's price.
So it means very little if BTC hits $10k or $20k - it's all based predominantly on fake trades.
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:04:38
There's a small problem - there isn't enough lenders to serve the needs of the borrowers.
That's why the central bank and fractional reserve banking were created.  
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:25:42
Trump and Kim Jong Un
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:17:43
GDAX itself claimed that their record is $650m that that's the total across all cryptos traded on their exchange.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:17:05
Increased to 2,000 BTCs.  Hmm.
Looks like sellers are lowering their expectations.
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:21:23
Don't think so .... volume is too low.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:40:11
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:19:33
Make what stop?
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:54:31
Nothing much will happen.  It's 1/10 of BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:54:34
I rather we see this as a fresh start.
Saying it's a correction from a crash 5 months ago is not being realistic.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:04:34
He's full of shit.  
Go through his history and you will see him inventing a new bullshit every time he's proven wrong (which is incidentally, 100%). 
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:23:56
More like the corner of a rehab center where they have throw away the key.
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:58:05
Maybe one day when price is stable.  
But when you are running a credit business on single digit fees and collecting on a monthly basis, it's hard to manage your risk when price is fluctuating 5-10% daily.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:26:13
Thanks, great explanation.
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:45:18
Didn't you see what the mod posted below?
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:17:05
No doubt.  And how would you charge interest?
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:43:39
What bounce are you talking about?
We have flatlined for a week.  It's lying there like a fucking dead fish.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:47:49
BTC's price is supported mostly through trades that would be considered illegal when regulation steps in.  E.g., take out Tether and BTC price will collapse.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:03:27
Wait a bit.
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:59:34
Well, look at it this way.  A 'normal' trade volume is about 5%-10% of circulation.  BTC is around that as are most cryptos and even stocks.
Tether's circulation is $2.5B but their daily trade is $2.6B (more than 100%).  What does that tell you?  It does nothing but is used to wash trade by a few individuals to bring up the prices of other cryptos.
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:47:35
LMFOA!!  "Extremely early adopter"??  
Dude, "extremely early" was before 2013 and "early" was before 2017.   
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:33:19
$0 is the bottom.  I'm not suggesting we are getting there but it is not impossible.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:32:03
I think it's a good move.  
But you should have sold at 9.9K+ if you believe it won't go above 10k (I don't).
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:31:34
You guys are so full of conspiracy shit.
The simpler reason is that people lost confidence when BTC couldn't break out of 10k and decided to take profit.
@_date: 2018-05-19 00:20:34
As did I.  Was busy turning down endorsement requests from all sort of ridiculous dot.com nonsense startups.
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:31:38
First, looneys claim BTC = Gold.  Now BTC = Oil?
Oil runs just about every moving part in our economy and our industries will collapse without Oil.  BTC is a digital token that will have ZERO impact if it disappear.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:36:18
You are so thoughtful!  
But, do worry less about my well being - your time is much better spent deciding when to cut your losses :) 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:08:48
Is that your best shot?  Loser.
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:46:16
Lol piker!  You just don't learn.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:31:19
Sure.  It's called being a loser.
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:37:02
"Always"?  
Tell that to people who bought between ATH down to $10k.
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:55:53
Sure.  Go buy and hodl.  Nothing stopping you.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:06:09
No, but I might invest in Gold.  
Fiat was never meant to be an investment vehicle.  It was created (from thin air like BTC) to be an instrument for transacting (which BTC aspires to be).
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:40:39
What are you talking about?  It is currently sub $8k so go buy if you want.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:44:59
Lol!  Almost everyone who said "it won't" have been proven wrong :)
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:28:37
You do English bro?
"No one has proved that there is fake trading going on"
No one?
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:14:47
You don't borrow your own money.  And banks at least pay me an interest.  And no, I don't pay for cheque services as a premium customer.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:46:44
It's just a digital token, don't think too hard about changing the world.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:27:29
I just find it ironical that there are people who thinks that it's different and that they know better.
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:29:19
I'm not sure if that's a good sign.
We need people to believe in investing in cryptos, preferably BTC.  
If you think anyone who got burnt dealing with alts will come to BTC, think again.  They will just leave the crypto scene altogether.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:35:35
Well, technically, you can't call it a Ponzi as there is no operator/hub.
It's decentralised (lol).
@_date: 2018-05-31 02:17:51
Well, it probably show more channels for speculative trading.
Show me any statistic that indicates increased number of merchants and I will be convinced.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:45:51
Damn .... you make it sound almost biblical.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:41:16
Let's get one fact straight - they have NEVER been audited.
September audit?  Here's that it is 
@_date: 2018-05-12 02:45:36
I'm not sure if asking friends and families to buy into a speculative asset is a good idea.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:52:00
Well, we had our fun.  That was pooled money for our parties.
Those were the days where BTC was really (I mean seriously) useful.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:46:57
The exodus of the manipulators will start and the dumping will follow.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:40:24
You are digressing.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:45:21
No.  It's a fantasy created to induce FOMO.
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:58:28
Well, it's not really a financial crisis.  More a political crisis.
But yes the irony - it's ultimately about control of fiscal policies.  
So think - if a government is willing to risk isolation in order to control it's fiscal policies, you still think it will willingly surrender it to a currency which they will have zero control?
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:48:30
I do not think so.
The only thing you will see is tons of negative publicity when NASDAQ starts complaining about price manipulations on the other exchanges.  Which we all know is happening but is silent when it suits our needs.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:20:59
Bingo.  
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:32:13
Leave it alone and forget about it.
Come back in 5 years.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:24:20
Yes, I doubt if anyone knows how far down the rabbit hole this goes.
And ultimately, the price impact is still up to the market to decide.  
Even if there's a real prosecution and Tether goes up in smoke, the market may still decide to ignore it and the price remains intact.
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:08:18
Long overdue.
Let's hope we get some sanity moving forward.
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:45:23
Zzzzz .....
Now I'm sensing that your claim of 10 years of fx trading is baloney as well.
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:06:39
I have never claimed to be anything near an expert nor that I'm good at trading.
Go see a shrink.  Your posts are saying that you have a low self esteem, which leads to a tendency to attack anyone that you think is successful (even if it's just your imagination).
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:05:52
Roughly 1,800 BTCs more to be sold before it hits $10k on bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:08:31

So why should you lend?
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:33:36
In essence, he is saying that the cost of production will increase and consequentially, the price will increase (regardless of demand or value generated).
Yeap, he's high.
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:15:03
Lol!  I think your life is sadder if you have to retort my posts :)
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:22:31

@_date: 2018-05-08 00:27:31
So McAfee and Tom Lee throwing wild projections are not offensive?
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:00:53
For pete's sake, it's just a $300 dip.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:48:39
Last one was back about ... hmmm, 5-6 years ago.
I am on clonazepam and it's totally legit.

You don't smoke mollies.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:09:51
I already sold 20% to prepare for buy opportunities.  Rest I will just ride the storm.
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:14:18
Good as it will eventually lend some credibility to BTC.
But to get there, expect the journey to be really rocky.
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:30:05
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:36:50
As was last year's rise to $20k.  Pump'ed by Tether.
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:40:08
Mining and processing of transaction (e.g. confirmation) are two separate jobs.  Think of it as production and ongoing operations cost.
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:03:55
Aren't you the piker who claimed to be able read the market like an old movie and that it will go pass 10k early this week?
You really are full of shit.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:50:32
You are missing the point.  The paper showed how price was manipulated from $150 to over $1,000 in late 2013.
In other words, out of the 2 price spikes in the history of BTC (2013, 2017), one of them has been proven to be due to price manipulation.
The 2017 spike is believed to be manipulated through Tether by Bitfinex and there is plenty of documentation on that.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:49:46
Waiting for bottom to buy.
Why are you here?  
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:32:39
Who said anything about savings?
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:00:15
Most of the people here are in denial.
Anyway, it's a matter of time before bitfinex/Tether is publicly exposed and that will be the trigger for a full crash.
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:39:36
Stop dragging more people into debt and losses.
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:19:42
Lol!  Ok, you win :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:27:02
That's why it's called a bubble and now it's deflating.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:24:18
Ok, sure :).
Just so that you don't feel that I'm 'throwing it in your face' - I do not consider what we are discussing here to be anywhere near the definition of immerse wealth.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:19:09
Dude, that's what makes it fun! :).
For me - Stocks = Work, BTC = Sport
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:57:29
We are dealing with an unregulated market with price manipulations like wash trading and pump/dump in plain sight.  
I too trade for profits and not a hodler.  My friend, you are not the first and won't be the last to declare that the market is easy to read ... and leave humbled.
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:58:47
Feel free to show that I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:44:31
Well said :)
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:29:29
Apple and Google produce great products and services, provide employment to hundreds of thousands of people, earn close to $150B in profits each year.
Bitcoin is a digital token which is not even used as a currency and the price is 100% speculated.  It can be $200 or it can be $2m, there is no basis.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:27:05
Yes, and their volume has tapered down since then.
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:13:49
Possibly.  50/50.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:15:57
Yeap.  Sell the crash ... it's still going down.
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:51:22
Ok ok, I will go long soon.
..... Closed 7.2.  Shall not push my luck.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:43:25
That, my friend, is the $T question that everyone wants to know.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:37:09
We all love to think that BTC is special.
But other than brand, every crypto is the same.  They are just tokens being speculated on the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-05-28 03:41:29
Sorry but the flaw in your argument is the huge leap of faith to assert that BTC will reach anywhere near the level of acceptance that Gold enjoys as a asset.  
This is one of the most common false equivalence fallacy. Take away this comparison and your entire price argument crumbles.
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:18:40
Agree - there is nothing new here.
@_date: 2018-05-13 09:15:17
Lol ..... 'BTC is the future' :).
Future of what may I ask?
Yes, we can both agree that it's not a stock, which has value underpinned by the performance of a company generating goods and services.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:17:06
Hmm ..... no permabull claiming that this is a "correction"?
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:38:18
Adoption is a joke.
BTC as a currency died with exchanges and the speculation that they encouraged.  
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:47:48
Flip a coin.  
That is as accurate as any expectation, projection, calculation or whatever analysis.
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:19:40
Now 2,300 BTCs.
Ok, nothing to see, come back tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:26:02
The issue is not with alt trading per se.  It's the blatant wash trading that is happening.  
The challenge to regulation is that exchanges are dispersed and can't be done without cooperation among governments.  Yes - when that happens, prices of all cryptos will crash.
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:21:26
You are late to the party.
I shorted 2x at 98.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:45:55
For transparency - I have 0 zero in my wallets.
Didn't I just say that I'm 200 short?
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:25:39
I think some of the wash trading has toned down after the DOJ announcement.
In my opinion, the real trading is probably no more than 200m - 300m per day using fiat.  Rest are just wash trades especially on bitfinex, binance, huobi and okex.
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:49:36
That's not true.
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:52:54
You just jinxed it.  Prepare for 8k.
@_date: 2018-05-07 01:48:38
Hard to say.  Crashes of a few $k within short span of a few days is relatively common.
During such crashes, BTC sliced right through every level of support without even pausing.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:49:53
Well, a lot of them made solid profits shorting above 9.5 and closing at 8.2.
Seems that it's building up today again.

This statement ...... is where you lose all credibility.
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:58:08
Because the upside to a solid short is capped at 7.3 and most folks here need at least a 10x parabolic to buy their lambo.  So their only option is to hodl.

It's 200 short at 8.2 and the position is still open.
I was not throwing it in his face - it was to correct his claim that I was losing money and therefore making what he perceived as a negative opinion on BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:38:18
Lol .... I'm deciding whether to cover my short from 98.  I can walk off with 360k if I want.  
Dude, you have been making wrong predictions all the time.  Maybe you should talk less.

Then you understand very little about his investment philosophies.  
If you do, you will understand why he will not invest in cryptos.
Not suggesting he's right or wrong, only that he's consistent in practising what he preaches.

Dude, I can buy whatever I need using a credit card or a host of new cashless payment services.
BTC is trying to re-invent the wheel and failing to do it.  
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:41:50
Most cryptos are decentralised.  And mining farms will shift their workloads to whichever prevails.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:27:35
Let's say Tether was sold for 10 cents.
That means even as I write this, each BTC is still being traded for $750 on Bitfinex, not $7,500.  
If this is the case and made public, would you still pay US$7,500 for a BTC?  Or are you more like to be willing to pay only $750?
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:25:03
We were talking about our breakeven point.  My original was $250 because it was bought many years ago.  Just like BCashBCashBTrash who bought at $400.

Typical piker behaviour.
Every retard can make a wild claim.  That's not "having balls".  It's called bullshit.
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:53:20
There are plenty who bought in the last month and sitting on close to 50% profit.  
Should take profit off the table and wait for the dip.  Unless of course he strongly feels this is going to break the 10k barrier.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:58:56
Well, I did have to explain your contradiction.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:48:19
6 months is NOTHING.
Remember .... Gandhi struggled for 42 years to free India!!!
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:19:50
Well, you may be right.  
Maybe I should close my position and again take the profit off the table :).
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:15:11
Maybe he has another large short order to close?
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:42:42

r/btctrading?  I don't even go there, what are you talking about?
I know you are fascinated with me but the feeling is not mutual.
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:17:00
Correction - I said I took 1.2m profit off the table so obviously my capital is a lot higher than that.
Sure I can get creamed with a short at 50:50.  But the same risk applies to a leveraged long when it goes the wrong way.  Hodlers think they are 'safe' but my take is that they will most likely be the ones holding the shit can at the end of the day.
Hut and fat girlfriend?  Well, go ahead and imagine anything to make yourself feel better :)

My friend, the difference between you and I is that I see the market for what it is while you see the market for what you want it to be.

Till the price started sky rocketing.  We didn't even realise it and I sold mine at 17k (do the maths - our buy price was around 250).
That was my first BTC trade for fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:12:59
I think a lot of people are just disappointed it didn't break 10k, not so much as the follow up dip.
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:00:01
Sorry, no.  You can continue to shit long after that so it's not scarce.
Furthermore, it's overpriced at $3.50.  Try $2.00, will sell like hot turds.

They are over 1,000 alts and most of them have the same or superior tech.

@_date: 2018-05-16 01:50:19
What vision?
BTC may have a better brand but both are just tokens doing nothing much other than being speculated on the exchanges (the only people making real money).
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:50:47
No doubt the scarcity is real and the cost is substantial.  But both are artificial and neither drives the price.
Come on, is it acceptable to you if your plumber tells you that you have to pay 10x the price because he decided to make a simple job 10x more difficult?  No - you will want to pay only for the value that he delivered.
As for scarcity, it is it totally irrelevant unless the demand is higher than what's available.  And there is zero indication of increased demand as it stands.
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:38:11
But the crux of the conspiracy is hinged on control of money.  
So either (a) it's part of the conspiracy, (b) it is irrelevant to their plan or (c) it's destined for destruction.

@_date: 2018-05-24 10:49:02
No, they can't.  But simply by making public the manipulation is enough to crash the price.

It's funny that you asked about using a debit card in Iraq when BTC is not even accepted in 99.99999% of the civilised world for payment.
And it's not some advanced tech.  It's an 8-year-old tech that hardly works.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:50:26
50/50 means the same risk whether you go long or short.
Omg .... You are seriously stupid.  Now I'm beginning to feel guilty hitting on a genuine retard :(
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:49:49
Because there is no basis to it's price other than speculated.
It really is that simple and anyone who says this is untrue is just bull shitting.
@_date: 2018-05-02 02:22:10
When merchants start to price their goods and services in BTC, then yes.  Otherwise, it's just silly.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:22:50
Well, most of you want institutional money, ETFs, NASDAQ, etc, claiming that it will drive up price.
BTC's price is high because of speculation and lack of governance.  Gemini working with NASDAQ is the start.  It will only get worse before it gets better.
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:37:42
Not just the apps but more importantly, acceptance by merchants.
But to be candid, there's very little interest to make this successful.  Almost every piece of news is about BTC's price.  That's what is dominating the public's mindshare and that's why adoption has been a failure.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:34:21
It's all relative to their original buy price and there is zero guarantee that the price will go higher.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:42:21
But you are probably not aware that (a) the 2013 spike has already been proven to be manipulated and (b) the 2017 spike is suspected of being manipulated through Tether.
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:28:53
BTC scarcity is artificial and so is it's mining cost.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:03:41

This forum is filled with hodlers who don't like the fact that other people are making solid profits while they wait for their moon.

You mean 'can accept' rather than 'can afford'.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:30:12
On the contrary, I love BTC.  Already taken 1.2m off the table.
Why do you think I don't like it?  Just because I don't subscribe to looney ideas like BTC replacing fiat or becoming the de facto payment system?
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:43:58
It's just 200-300, not even worth mentioning.

You are just in denial.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:59:30
And likewise, I'm expressing my view of what Bitcoin is to me.
It is a token speculated on exchanges for profit.  Otherwise, why would 90% of the posts on this forum be about price on the exchanges?

I do not think Satoshi planned for BTC to be traded on exchanges as a speculation asset and price manipulated to a bubble (which is what it is today).
The BTC you see today is a perversion of his vision.

@_date: 2018-05-27 21:12:51
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:45:04
That's precisely the flawed thinking that BTC advocates are day dreaming about.
I.e. that the limited supply of BTC will mean that everything else that is priced against it will deflate.   
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:44:13
Well, if you believe so, take a short.

And to answer your question honestly -
a.  No, I'm pretty much in the black.  Over 1.2m and counting.

I will see you to the bottom :).

Do you still think you can sell your apple for $5 to the next buyer?
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:19:14
Absolutely - a financial crisis is guaranteed if they do that and yes, there's the risk of contagion.
My point simply is that the desire of a nation to control it's own policies (especially fiscal) is so strong, it's still on the table despite the threat of wiping out it's economy in the process.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:32:58
That's just plain stupidity.  
BTC's price is 100% speculated and when there's no longer any interest, it will plunge.  This is the problem investing in an asset that generates zero returns.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:04:47
No, not trying to convince you.

So?  Trillions of fiat dollars get transferred every second through the world's financial systems to land that plate of food that you just ate, built your house and paved the roads.
In the meantime, BTC is just a digital token that is not legal tender in most countries, banned in some and not accepted by 99.9999% of merchants selling goods and services.  It's existence is for the pleasure of the 0.00001% of the population speculating on it's price.
So don't preach about "sound money" or obfuscate the point of it being a medium of exchange when this whole discussion IS about method of payment.
@_date: 2018-05-12 02:44:31
Thanks, interesting.
Personally, I don't think TA works for cryptos because of the widespread price manipulation.  But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:52:39
I think people often confuse the value of the infrastructure with the value of the medium.
BTC as a currency will function the same whether a BTC cost $100, $1,000 or $100,000.

Dude, just look at the price history.  Drops of 500 and increases of 500 a day are very common.
Don't even try to rationalise the reason because usually there isn't one.  It's all based on sentiments and speculations.

2% inflation is peanuts compared to 60% drop in value in 5 months for BTC.
And whether you like it or not, the rate of adoption of payment systems like Apple Pay and Ali Pay far outstripped all cryptos.  These are the future of retail payments, not BTC.

This is pathetic.  I wish it will either go up to 10k or crash to 4k.  As is, it's half-dead on life support barely hanging on to 6.5k.  
You can't go long or short, price is "stable" but no adoption.

That will be good for current owners but it won't create the needed FOMO. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:38:42
They bought it at pre 2017 prices for less than $1k.
Of course they sold plenty at $20k and resulted in the price dropping.  So what they are doing now is to regularly pump up the price (to $15k, $14k ... $7.5k) and then resume selling (dump) which result in price fall.
Dude, whales don't give a shit about BTC.  To them, it's just an instrument for what will soon be unveiled as the biggest scam in history.

@_date: 2018-06-13 15:16:41
I'm sorry but it's just a hunch.
My hunch says that purely from a psychological point of view, $6k was the lowest since ATH and if it goes below that this time with all the pent up negativity, .... the result is a free fall.
Don't forget the last time it touched $6k, optimism was high, most people treated it as just an incidental dip and it recovered almost immediately.

When you dispose of large quantities of BTC, of course the price will drop.
Therefore, the obvious way is to 'pump and dump'.  Which is what has been happening for a long time.
I doubt if most of them are buying back.  They accumulated long before ATH (which was the big pump).  Now, they are just disposing.  That's also why you see the price dropping since ATH.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:24:54

Sorry, I think you are the one doing the 'pigeon hole' thing.
High end GPUs did increase in price in 2017 and we both know that's a glitch due to supply/demand.  You and I also both know that as a norm, we have been paying lower prices for higher GPU performance year after year.  
Of course you can continue to pay higher prices for a premium iPhone but doesn't the last model continue to plumper in price?  You can pay for a more expensive Internet package but don't you get far better performance?  It is a GIVEN that we have been paying lower prices for the same Internet performance year after year.
I seriously don't understand why you want to debate an obvious fact of modern life - that we pay increasingly less for the same performance where tech commodity products are concerned.
Of course adoption must be tied to merchants.  They are the ones that dictate where BTC is used as a currency and not just for speculation (which delivers ZERO economic value).
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:51:02
You are right.  Except that I won't call them long term investors.  More appropriate term is - Bag Holders.
If it's still not clear that whales and exchanges orchestrated the Dec ATH as the pivot to accumulate and dump BTC for cash, then please keep holding.
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:16:03
No, they are not.  
And they see it for what it really is - a number generated on a machine and sitting on a fancy ledger.

No one knows where this is going and anyone who claims otherwise is just making up BS.  So:
1.   Determine your own loss threshold and do not be afraid to sell if it hits that threshold.  If it goes lower after that, you can always buy back.  And if it goes higher, you simply missed a small profit opportunity.
2.   Hodl if you can afford.  There were two spikes (2013 and 2017).  Whether manipulated or not, it happened and there's a chance that it might happen again in future.
Stay safe, don't lose more than you can afford by listening to other BS here promising the moon. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:48:04

.... but I really don't think so!
My honest opinion is that the price of BTC is based on speculation and nothing else.  And the same applies to the entire crypto world.
I also think that the price of BTC will go up in the short term simply because a huge proportion is held by whales and they will manipulate the price up.
The only real threat is Tether.  If that (and Bitfinex) gets called out by the SEC, then it's really going to crash.

Let me summarise it in an easier way.  There are:
1.  The Scammers (masquerading as Exchanges and BTC "Gurus").
2.  Their Lackeys (also called "Traders", "Speculators", etc).  Knows the game and takes the crumbs.
3.  The Suckers (currently called Hodlers but will soon be remembered as the Bag Holders).
Just my honest 2 cents.
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:21:18
Cryptos are infested with snake oil salesmen.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:53:41
Sure, that will probably happen.
But that does not mean the price will go up.
In fact, my take is that BTC need to crash all the way down to a stable level stripped of the speculative value in order for adoption to happen.  And that will be going back to before the 2013 manipulation (which will be around $200 - $250). 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:36:30
Like I said -
Name me just one example of a commodity tech that has increased in price with adoption.

What matters is that the coins were stolen.  And based on the number of times this has happened means that it can and will happen again.

And no, please don't compare it with a bank.  When a bank gets robbed, customers don't lose anything.  The same does not apply to exchanges.  When it gets hacked, customers lose their coins.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:45:01
I don't think anyone is going to "take" BTC away.  It will just become irrelevant.
So what if BTC is "global"?  Tell me how many purchases have you made in your last 10 years that is international and warrants the use of a currency exchange?
Visited China within last 1-2 years?  It's now truly a cashless society.  People use Alipay or WeChat to pay for almost everything.    
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:34:30

Let's hope that it bounces from here.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:23:57
Nice, you are one of the few who figured this out.
At some point (probably when the regulators clamp down), all that will be left are the ~~bag holders~~ moon worshipers.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:40:35
Errr ... sorry but what exactly are you trying to say?
@_date: 2018-06-03 07:31:49
Yes, it's real.  $100
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:11:26
You just proved me right.
If you were genuine in wanting BTC to succeed, it will be to encourage people to use and spend BTC, not speculate in its price and hoping to get rich by doing nothing.
You obviously are clueless that the two goals are incompatible - a volatile price and acceptance as a currency.
So yes, I stand by what I say - You are a hypocrite and a rent seeker.

It means everything where the price of BTC is concerned.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:56:21
That's the mindset that drive most people to lose money.
When the price is on the downturn, it's always better to take profit.  If the price recover and is on the upturn, you capitalise on the potential profit.  Sure, you lose some potential gains in between but that's far better than taking a loss.
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:48:39
Luck?  That's the result of 20 hours of TA!
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:28:38
You got conned.
All the buying was completed before the Dec ATH was engineered.  And all that has been happening since then is systematic dumping.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:44:01
Lol .... down voted because I think 6.5 might not hold?  
You guys are in denial and it's not healthy.  Invest/speculate with your eyes open before you lose your pants.

What I'm saying is that adoption drives economy of scale, brings in capital that goes back into production/design improvements that further brings down the price/output.
Sure, iPhone may command a price premium but the market average price of a mobile phone has been decreasing for years already.
I'm not aware of ANY tech commodity that has commanded an increase in price with wider adoption.  Do you have an example in mind?
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:46:07
Which is not sustainable as the transaction fees will become exorbitant.  So either the price has to gradually drop to the level to make the transition successful or the continued use of BTC as a currency will render it non viable.  
Sorry, but the above is the reason why the notion of scarcity to justify the high price of BTC is wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:07:14
If dick eating is your cup of tea, by all means.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:55:43
Keep hodling :)
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:11:26
I agree on the transaction cost analogy.
That's why I said that BTC as a currency will continue to function whether it's $1, $100, $1k or $10k.  In short, BTC's price is completely irrelevant.
Look, if any person needs to use BTC to buy something that cost $100.  Does it matter to him whether BTC cost $1, $100, $1k or $10k?  Nope - he will just buy the needed quantify for $100.
So the entire notion that adoption will increase price is baloney.  But as you correctly put it - the transaction cost must come down with adoption.  If it does not, then people will simply switch to a network that does.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:52:34
The miners run their operations like any business.  If the price goes below their operational cost, they will just down-size or stop altogether ..... just like any unprofitable business.  When that happens, hash rate goes down, complexity goes down and remaining miners continue to operate at a profit.
The point is that price is driven by demand (or rather, speculation), not cost.  BTC was working fine whether the price was $1, $10, $100, $1k or $10k.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:05:30
BTC is just a hobby.  We have more serious investments to look after most of the time.
And yes, I have made plenty trading BTC.  Both Longs and Shorts.  Best was shorting all the way down from recent 10k.
Keep holding if you want.  We need plenty of bag holders. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:05:07
There will be plenty of bag holders all the way down to $100.  
Trust me ...
@_date: 2018-06-04 01:55:40
The bottom is getting higher but the top is also getting lower.
As usual, the permabulls will tell only half the story.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:17:27
Lol ... I'm not being deliberately sarcastic.
But you need to take your mind off BTC's price and you will get what I mean.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:37:05
Dunno.  Your bigger concern is not the bear market.
You should be more concerned about people starting to believe that digital tokens with no real world use case aren't worth thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:36:04
If that really happens, it won't stop at 5.9k.  So let's hope it does not happen.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:34:13
Lol .... "in it for the tech"?  Whatever that means.

All of these propaganda were started by the whales after they have accumulated enough cheap coins before they engineered the Dec ATH.
What we are seeing since then is a systematic 'pump &amp; dump' for them to dispose of these coins.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:59:36
Bull is back!  Price went up by $23!
Damn, every little jump looks good when you zoom in.
Edit:  Cheer up, guys.  The price will go back up in the short term for a simple reason - huge amount is still held by the whales and they will manipulate the price up again.  Longer term once they have disposed, it's not going to look good.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:40:27
"Buy the tech" ... by buying BTC is downright silly.
You make money buying a share of Apple company (32% increase in last one year), not by buying an iPhone (obsolete during the same period).
Furthermore, BTC as a currency will continue to function whether it's $1, $100, $1k or $10k.  In other words, increased adoption does not drive up the price.  
In fact, it is the opposite.  Every important tech (Internet, mobile, telephone, cars ...) has shown that increased adoption drives down the price.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:14:33
To discourage more people from losing their money.
Aren't the reasons I stated true?  Feel free to correct me if it's wrong.

RIP .... peace out bro.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:25:49
Lol .... you have been watching too much BTC marketing BS.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:56:26
Yes, there is no solid evidence.
But it is not prudent to ignore the fact that $2.6B of Tether was created and bitfinex has to date, refused to provide an audited statement to show that it's backed 1-1 by USD.
Like I said, you can dismiss it and go into denial.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:37:40
10x is 1,000% returns.  And that means only one thing in the real world - it is a bubble.  
Eventually price must follow value.  And if anyone can explain BTC's value increasing 10x last year, I would love to hear it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:42:03
Wrong again.  The acceptable trading margin is 0.3% spread on spot.
You said gold can't be sold and you were just proven to be dead wrong.  This itself shows that you are just a novice when it comes to investing.
Now stop making a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:01:06
It really is that simple.
And BTC "gurus" love to tell BS stories to make it complicated.  Take away all the BS and what is left is that - a number generated on a machine.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:47:23
People who bought this year are not "early adopters".
Early are those who bought way back before 2013, slightly late are those who bought before 2017.  
After Dec 2017, all buyers are already bag holders unless you can find an opening to cut your losses and exit.
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:01:14
Lol .... stop trolling :)
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:00:27
That's because you are a retard who don't understand the meaning of what I said.
Volume is irrelevant because more than 95% of BTC's trade volume is FAKE.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:51:13
Come on ..... no drama.
People here are so reactive.
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:05:20
Then you don't understand why they are both wrong.  It's not just the price projections (which by themselves are absurd), it is the basis of their projections which are flawed.
McAfee's projection is based on the increasing cost of mining and everyone knows that it's demand that drive price, not cost.
Tim's projection is based on replacing of 10% of fiat by cryptos due to increased adoption.  And everyone knows that adoption as a currency is not happening.  
What is really happening is that cutting edge payment systems like AliPay and WeChat is growing rapidly and threatening the banks, not cryptos.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:39:04
Not to be offensive but both were based on manipulation and both crashed.
Yes, BTC is a disruptive technology but make no mistake - it was price manipulation that helped it reach ATH in both 2013 and 2017.
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:27:13
There isn't a trillion dollar industry.  
You got conned.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:43:14
It needs real world usage.  
Futures, ETFs, etc are just vehicles for the finance industry to make more commissions and give speculators more ropes to hang themselves.
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:52:45
Every single BTC is already owned by someone (or lost).  
Buying/selling BTC by itself is called speculation and does nothing but creates price volatility.
You have just validated to everyone reading this is that you are a hypocrite and a rent seeker.  Ever occured to you that you are doing a menial job because that's what you are really worth and nothing more?
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:01:53
The people here encouraging people to buy in a bear market are usually losers hoping there will be new buyers to help with their losses.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:42:38
I just detest people going around encouraging others to buy in a bear market when the price is dropping like a brick.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:54:11
Keep holding the bag.  You can carry it to your 'menial' workplace (your words, not mine).
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:18:36
You mean any of you actually believe this BS?
Perhaps if you would spend some time understanding the "basis" of his projection, you will know it's 100% bullshit.

Hmm.   Trend says downwards since Dec.
Ok, let's play blind/deaf/mute monkeys.  
How about public interest waning, regulators cramping down, Tether time bomb that might explode anytime, exchanges getting hacked on a regular basis (or so they claimed)?
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:52:42
The street vendor is buying the dip.
Smart fellow.
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:24:35
Let's just try for 7k first.
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:30:16
Lol ... every time someone says that, it gets jinxed and a drop follows :)
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:54:52
BTC today is where it's price was engineered last year to reach ATH and has been crumbling since despite more Tether being 'printed' to support it.  $2.6B to be precise.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:48:34
It all boils down to greed.
And selling when it has dropped 15-20% from ATH is a good thumb of rule in any market.
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:52:01
No, it doesn't make sense from a logical perspective.
But this is an emotion driven market.  And when the selling point BTC is security and a hack happens, people see this as an 'invalidation' of BTC's value proposition.
We can argue all we want that it is technically inaccurate but most BTC owners are not technically proficient enough to understand.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:36:00
He's a retard to drag his family into this shit.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:15:20
Wrong.  You have a poor understanding of basic economics.
Price is cost of transaction, nothing to do with price of BTC (which is totally irrelevant).
And if BTC's transaction cost per performance does not come down, it will simply be replaced by another network (alt).
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:57:16
Ultimately, it's the security of the entire ecosystem that matters, including exchanges that allow trading.
This argument that 'BTC itself wasn't hacked' holds no water for people who lost their coins.
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:47:52
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:41:16
Dude, let's stop all these stupid ideas about BTC replacing fiat.
It is not going to happen.
This whole idea was shilled by BTC "Gurus" to create FOMO.

Oh well, I'm off to bed.  Good luck and don't lose more than you can afford.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:22:52
Profit taking.
6.5 can go either way.
What is surprising to me is that there are still so many open positions.  That means a lot of shorts believe it going to crash even lower.

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:19:55

They are now so you can expect the noise level to escalate.
@_date: 2018-06-09 07:35:37
I dunno where this "can't buy/sell Gold" FUD comes from.
Gold spot prices are public and there are plenty of retailers that will buy/sell solid gold coins, bars, etc.  Yeap, it's quite cool carrying 1kg gold bars and walk around :)
Here's one in Singapore where I live - 
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:59:03
Well, if I had been trading in alts, I would be doing much better than anyone dealing with BTC since it's been the worst performing among the top 5 coins.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:27:27
My hero!
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:22:47
Dude, if manipulation like Tether, wash trading, etc are stopped, BTC's price will plunge right to the dirt.
Manipulation is holding the price up, not dragging it down.  It's the panic sellers that are pulling it down.
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:47:57
Go read my history.
I said I will buy at 6k and the order got triggered.
To be candid, I wasn't expecting it to be triggered so soon.  Thought it won't happen till end of the coming week.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:40:55
It's going to fall even more.
This is the first time I see Tether working flat-out and BTC's price is still falling.
$3.2B of Tether traded in 24hours (on a market cap of only $2.6B).
It's the end guys.  I'm cutting my losses and calling it a day.
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:45:41
Actually, I blame it on the exchanges that encouraged speculation and then rigged it with blatant price manipulation.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:23:18
Where did that extra 2% come from?  That 2% makes your claim suspicious.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:38:31
Sure.  Keep filling up your bag so that we can dispose at higher price.
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:09:47
I'm saying understand the market for what it is and just ride along.
I have been shorting it in bursts since 17k (when I sold my original batch).
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:22:02
Judging by recent trend, might not even get a chance.
It probably will go sideways for 2-3 weeks and suddenly drop $1k.
@_date: 2018-06-03 00:24:59
Absolutely.  I was awed by that $150 pump.  Awesome.  Zzzzzzz.
Even the stock market is more exciting at this time.

@_date: 2018-06-12 16:28:56
Doesn't change the definition of what constitutes a correction, crash and bear.
Stop trying to put lipstick on a pig by changing terminology.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:53:45
Nope, they are not gone.  $100m of fresh Tether printed yesterday.
That probably accounted for the bump to above $6.5k.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:43:34
Isn't it clear by now that you are a bag carrier?
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:06:53

Will go up to 6700 again in about a day.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:10:40
At this juncture, most people wants to know what's the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:03:33
All of which becomes irrelevant once the Tether time bomb explodes.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:07:13
No decent traders will take such risks without a hedge somewhere else.  I wonder what they are hedging on since there aren't any counter balance to cryptos (they are all linked).

The reptilians?
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:05:22
Short now?  
The thought cross my mind when it dropped to 6.5k but I think it's suicidal.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:08:05
That is happening 30 times every hour.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:54:28
You are one of the few remaining delusional morons left.
Most have woken up to reality.  That huge increase in volume is the sound of people scrambling to dump while they can.  Make no mistake - this is a bank run.
Anyway, we will know in a few weeks on whether there will be a recovery or further declines.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:46:06
RSI is 36.1.  Yes, close to Oversold.

It's actually a superior Ponzi as the next generation of suckers aren't even born yet and they will be born into debt.
@_date: 2018-06-16 05:26:02
I think it might be due to this:
"Earlier this week, the Japanese Financial Security Agency (FSA) announced that on June 18, there will be an outright ban on all cryptocurrencies that provide a sufficient degree of anonymity to its end users".
BTC is not really affected but the merchants may be over-reacting.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:56:18
So?  You can have 21m worth $1 each.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:12:58
Why?  
I thought all of us are just in "for the tech".  Or that cryptos will replace fiat so the current price is irrelevant?
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:41:53
That wasn't a bull.  It was Daisy the Cow.

They are speculators like many of us ..... except with deeper pockets.
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:18:08
None.  
Some of the miners will stop mining, hash rate will drop and difficulty will likewise be reduced to achieve one block/10 minutes.  This will continue to a level where miners will again find it profitable.
That's the beauty of BTC.  It works regardless of price and don't forget this is the system that worked when BTC was $10.
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:35:25
Then don't.
Whether you or I believe is irrelevant.  
The only thing that matters is whether SEC or any of the regulatory authorities want to act on it.  I believe it's a matter of time.
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:57:56
It was a bad idea from the start.
Futures are designed to increase price stability.  But when introduced into a market that is not regulated and heavy price manipulation, it simply magnified the problem.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:06:29
It needs to be a false prophet.
Tom Lee comes to mind.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:58:35
My BRO!  I shorted all the way down from 9k+ :P
Closed my positions and taking a break now.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:54:10
True.  And blockchain will remain long after BTC has become history.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:36:41
Come on, the number of bitcoins you own has not decreased.
Great store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:28:16
No, they did not kill BTC.
People just lost interest, simple as that.  No drama please.
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:11:10
The Internet is likewise a network of transaction value.  Did the cost of accessing the Internet increased or decreased as adoption ramped up?

If it's true, it's good news because at least we have an acceptable bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:26:10
Great strategy if price goes up.  
Else throwing in good money after bad.
Incidentally, a lot of people did that during the dot com burst.  Kept throwing in money to 'average out' and went bankrupt.

Absolutely.  
Use up your credit card limit, take loans, mortgage your house, borrow/steal from your family.  Whatever it takes.  
There are people here who are convinced that it will hit 250k by 2022 (or they may  just be trying to get more suckers into the game to help with their losses).
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:53:03
Alright, so since it dropped more than 50% since ATH, by your retarded logic, there are now 50% less people owning BTC and ready to accept it as payment?
You are a moron.
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:02:38
At this pace, it will be 8k within this week.
Just don't jinx it.
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:40:20
True, BTC is 37.5% of market cap ....
... but accounts for only 27% of daily trades.  
Sorry dude, interest is clearly moving to the alts.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:23:30
Hypocrite and rent seeker.
Yes, I have glanced through your posts and it simply reinforces what I said.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:24:26
A 20% or more drop in price over 2 months is called a bear market.
It's not subjected to your interpretation.

There is a difference between fact based analysis and hyperbole like McAfee and Draper.
Noticed how all these permabulls are now giving plenty of excuses for their BS?
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:03:51
Perhaps you should read a little more widely about payment systems.
When you do, you will realise that BTC is a dinosaur.
Edit - Here's a good starter read.  This is what banks are scared of, not BTC.  Adoption - $12.8T of real world transactions (not exchange trades).
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:03:32
Consider yourself lucky that you haven't bought.
By the look of it, 6.5k might not hold.  Better to wait.

@_date: 2018-06-16 04:49:45
Sorry, there is zero guarantee that BTC's price will continue to appreciate in the long term.
And since it's already proven that the 2013 spike was manipulated and there's evidence that the 2017 spike was also manipulated, the expectation of future increases is close to ZERO (but possible).
P/S:  Since when did you get appointed to dictate what goes into this sub?  You are nothing but a rent seeker and a hypocrite.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:32:53
Go read up what rent seeking means.
Then tell me what is your contribution so that, to quote "I also believe it will make me epically rich in 4-5 years".
When you do, you will understand why I said you are contradicting yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:10:18
Dude, read my statement again -
"BTC as a currency will continue to function whether it's $1, $100, $1k or $10k. In other words, increased adoption does not drive up the price".
Did I say that BTC's price will drop with adoption?  Nope.
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:30:06
Yes, and what is a monetary unit?  A mechanism for the transaction of goods, which gives BTC it's value as a currency.
Just like a mobile phone is a mechanism for communication of voice and video and gives it it's value as a communication tool.
Prices of mobile phones dropped in price with adoption.  As will all instruments upon which the value of the system is dependent upon.  
If BTC doesn't yield it's entry price, it will just be replaced by other cryptos.
@_date: 2018-06-07 05:06:18
Means that it will not be subjected to the scrutiny and regulations imposed on securities.

But whether it's real or not is another matter.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:52:33
$100m of Tether printed yesterday and the price hardly stayed above $6.5k.
Let's see if Bitfinex dare to issue $500m to bring it to above $7k.  Will be interesting to see SEC's reaction.

Please don't insult the beanie babies:
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:46:17
And BTC is just a digital token, created from thin air and artificially capped at 21m (which is irrelevant since there are close to 2,000 alts now).

@_date: 2018-06-06 19:11:27
You are simply reinforcing my point - that advocates like yourself are simply creating BS to make a digital token appear more "complicated" than it actually is.
It is no more than a number generated on a machine.  Period.
Sure, there's a market with exchanges that encourage speculation on it's price.  But what is actually traded is no more than a computer generated number on a fancy ledger.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:10:30

I think they are happy just keeping the price steady while the whales unload their BTC for cash.
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:18:24
I think you don't understand pyramid schemes.  Because if you do, BTC speculation is exactly that.
Profits have been derived purely from increasing number of late participants paying higher prices to the earlier participants.  Zero profit was generated from the product (BTC) itself.  This is what a pyramid scheme is.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:28:36
Only morons will believe his crap.
His price prediction was worked backwards from the future cost of mining.  And that is pure nonsense as the price has nothing to do with the cost.
Just because it cost $1m to develop something does not mean there will always be buyers willing to pay $1m.

Seems like even r/bitcoin is dying.  
I remember the panic posts when the price was down.  Even these are gone.  Only the regular die hards left.
.... Another sign of desperation - Crypto "hedge funds" coming out in doves to tell us to buy.  Those in the financial sector will know that top hedge fund managers don't go public - they work for top dogs on stealth deals (usually to screw the majority).

Dude, there's a very wide chasm between people who believes it's going to be worth millions because it will replace every existing fiat and people who believes this is just a digital token currently in a bubble.
You will get no consensus and most literature out there will be presenting either side of this wide gap.  Check out Tom Lee's and Warren Buffett's view on this. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:35:59
tl;dr but sounds more like you are the one creating more FUD.
RSI at 1d, 1w, 1m, 4h, 1h ..... all between 30 and 70, which means NEUTRAL.
So please cut the BS.   BTC is NOT Oversold as you claimed.
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:02:28
You don't get it.
The whales started accumulating way before 2017.  Created Tether and used it to manipulate price to 20k.  Now, they are slowly dumping (and pumping occasionally to maintain price) to cash out.
In the meantime, they hire "gurus" to talk up some fantasy price "in the future" to keep the bag holders in the game and sometimes bag some noobs in.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:59:44
No, it's just the dump phase of the 'pump and dump'.
The only thing anyone should be worried about is whether this is the final dump to oblivion.  If not, we will see the price pumped up again.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:53:39
Agree.  If you are willing to wait it out, there is a good chance you might succeed.
BTC went parabolic twice (manipulated or otherwise) so there's no reason why it can't happen the third time.
But until it happens, you are carrying the bag.  If that's fine for you, then all is good.
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:46:41
Well, the danger is that you can end up either (a) losing more money or (b) holding the bag for years, tying up capital that can be better used elsewhere.
At the current moment, the above possibilities are rather high.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:41:29
Me too.  But I'm a little more optimistic to think it will bounce off high 5K.

The opposite is also true - that BS posts claiming that price will go to $xxx not only do not get banned, they get upvoted.
So the delusional level of this forum becomes self-perpetuating.
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:38:03
Ok.  I will buy when it hits bottom.
It's barely able to break out of 7.5k so it probably will go a lot lower.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:11:53
You mean you actually bought into the "limited supply" crap?  
Seriously?  
And exchanges were setup to cash in on the trading fees.  They are not your friends.
@_date: 2018-06-20 10:48:17
I agree.
But look at the people coming here on a regular basis asking basic questions like what's a wallet and how to move coins.
That shows that are people who really don't know these stuff.

That's not how it works.  Go read up on relationship between hash rate and complexity.

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:14:58
And many will leave the business when it's unprofitable.  
Hashrate will drop, followed by Complexity.  Remaining miners will then resume business.

All these retarded talk about "evils of central banking" and in the same sentence, you talk about BTC's price in USD.

They are running before the regulators step in and clamp down.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:25:24
If they are really providing such a service in a legit manner, then why has Bitfinex refused to allow redemption of USDT for USD?
The only reason I can think of is that they are selling USDT for dime on the dollar to privileged customers.
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:31:01
You asked the question based on "expect".
I said "No", meaning I do not expect the price to go to $10k without manipulation.
Nothing can be certain, that's something that I'm sure we can both agree.  
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:02:28

Like I said - You are just a cheap rent seeker and a hypocrite.
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:09:43
BTC will just adjust the complexity and make it cheaper to mine when there are less miners.  That's the beauty of BTC - it works regardless of price.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:16:11
Well, it's obviously heading in the wrong direction :)

@_date: 2018-06-16 15:49:48
I think most people here are not in the mood to hear the truth.
Anyway, I have been warning about the Tether time bomb for some time already.  This is the first time that it's proven using statistical methods.  
If the regulators come down hard on Bitfinex, which is just a matter of when, the market will react very badly.
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:27:12
It's mostly fake volume.
GDAX trading for BTC/USD is only $32m daily and all US exchanges is less than $100m.  
Up to you to believe either:
a.   America is so small that it is irrelevant (2% of $4.2B trades).
b.   Most of the $4.2B trades are fake.
So which do you want to believe? 
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:33:38
BTC doesn't even use GPU as the primary mining tool for years already.  And $/ASIC output has been dropping like a bomb.
And Fyi, $/GPU output have been dropping anyway and will continue to drop, just like any commodity h/w.
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:20:37
Most of the shorts started accumulating on 30 May.
Good call on their part and making good money.  I'm surprise they have not started closing their position when it hit 6.5k.

@_date: 2018-06-16 02:42:55
Before that happens, price manipulation and other irregularities need to be weed out.  Especially with the Tether time bomb that many here are eager to dismiss as FUD.
As for current price, yes - 50/50 and to me, it's a non-event whichever way it happens.
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:08:27
It make sense when you do not dismiss the possibility that most of the price gains were through Tether price manipulation.

BTC is not even legal tender in most countries and you expect the American or Chinese government to accept it for settlement of tariff taxes?
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:46:14
Yes, naming Tether as a security gives SEC jurisdiction over it (which I think is intentional).
Come come ...... US$2.6B?  Bitfinex not only has to show that it has US$2.6B in the bank, it also has to show that it is deposit to guarantee the $2.6B of Tether and that they will allow redemption in good faith.  Which will blow Bitfinex out of the water.

You are out of touch.
BTC was the medium in the past.  Now it's replaced by:
a.  Tether (which replaced BTC as the intermediary for fiat to other alts).
b.  Most exchanges now allow for direct purchase of alts using fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:19:59

I'm very familiar with Metcalfe's law and I'm even more familiar with how it has been deliberately misinterpreted by BTC advocates to justify BTC's price.
Metcalfe's law states the effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2).  This is common sense.
It says NOTHING about the effect of price with the increased value.  The fact is that every known commodity governed by Metcalfe's law (Internet, Mobile, Telephones, etc) has shown a DECREASED price as the networks grew.
As for BTC, it's already common knowledge by now that the price increases have been due to manipulation/speculation and nothing to do with adoption.

BTC can shoot up $500 within minutes and can drop the same amount within minutes as well.  No reason other than sentiments.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:31:40
The difference is called speculation.
The retard who paid the $5900 difference is doing it because he thinks he can sell it later for more.  There are morons here who even believe that it will go up to $250,000 in a few years (yes, they actually believe).
Otherwise, a $100 BTC is exactly the same as a $6,000 BTC.  Frankly, BTC doesn't gives a shit how much you paid for it.
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:47:11
Yes, it will go on for a long time more.
But public interest is gone and whatever is left is waning.
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:17:58
My frank opinion - it will flatline at around 6k for awhile.
And if it doesn't bounce off this line, it's really going to get bloody.

14 days from now?  I don't know and won't pretend to know.  It can start crashing in the next hour and none of us will be the wiser.
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:05:19
My point is that all the shorts got rekked only last week and for it to start growing so soon ... hmmm.
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:40:17
Let's see ... Huracan is around 400k.  
Assuming that BTC goes back to ATH (someday), you need to sink in 180k today.  You really want to take a 180k bet that BTC will go to 20k?
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:49:48
No, it's monitoring the market.  And when they detect the fraudulent activities on exchanges operating outside of SEC's jurisdiction, you will be seeing a lot of news.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:09:53
I don't think it's manipulation.  It's just sellers who thinks that's the best price they can sell for.
And because there are multiple exchanges, if the price were to move up on another exchange, the bots are smart enough to re-price it higher.  
These are just normal market dynamics.
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:39:56
No!  You are supposed to buy high and help all of us.
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:38:45
Ouch :)
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:54:07
Dude, even a broken clock is right twice a day.  
There has been one constant in BTC - morons who think they can read the trend and got rekked.
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:36:08
There are plenty of other assets that store value better than BTC.  A fundamental criteria to an asset being a good store of value is acceptance and consensus, not price.  Today, other than people speculating on BTC, rest of the world does not give a hoot about it other than curiosity.
The only reason for the price of BTC is based on pure speculation that someone else will pay a higher price for it.  Not because of some intrinsic value it has.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:59:30
Of course we do!  We need to be free of the corrupt bankers and governments!  We need our poor brothers and sisters to be saved from the debt slavery!
But first, let's all get rich by having BTC at $100k.  Then we solve above problems.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:39:10
You need luck, not skill.
The price of BTC is so heavily manipulated that TA makes zero sense.  And anyone telling you otherwise or giving advice that price will go up or down is full of shit.
Sure you can day trade and any trade has a 50/50 chance of being profitable at any given time.
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:21:17
I bought at 6.5K and sort of pissed that we are back to square 1.
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:21:30
Nonsense.  There is no new money coming in.
It's wholesale collusion between the exchanges and whales (probably the same people).  They are buying/selling BTC/Verge among themselves to generate fake volume and pump up BTC price.
How else can a single coin be traded 1.3x times in 24 hours?
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:29:42
My opinion - that was when it was used as a currency and the real price discovery period based on that usage.  It settled at around $200, which people felt was fair value for the purpose of trading.
Then came the exchanges, the speculators and manipulations and BTC died as a useful currency.
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:17:10
When an asset with zero (or unknown) intrinsic value loses 75% of it's value, it's called a deflating bubble.  
And there is absolutely no reason why it can't go down to pre-2017 price of &lt;$1k or pre-2013 price of &lt;$100.
So it's irresponsible to encourage people to buy, especially those who can't afford to lose more.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:33:40
BTC's fixed supply is artificial and anyway, there are thousands of alts out there.
If you think that intrinsic value has no impact on price, then you are just living in a make believe world. 
Anyway, peace out bro.  You can go on believing whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:00:23
What do you think the direct crypto to fiat move by Binance is all about?  And Bitfinex already offer fiat for most of the alts it carries.
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:28:47

@_date: 2018-04-13 07:47:13
Plenty.  Only 17k out of 40k closed their positions.
There's still 23k short.  
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:59:12
Fair point.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:32:07
It's good advice.
Speculating in BTC is fun but remember that it's just a number on the network you are buying, nothing more.  So play with spare cash that you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:29:38
But greed has fuelled exchanges and speculators, which led to volatile prices and killed adoption.  
I frankly don't see a way to break this ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:15:30
Dude, inflation is 2% per year.  
But yes, cash is intended for convenience, not investment.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:52:22
Oh really?
Tell that to the people who bought at 20k, 18k, 16k, ......
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:49:53
Shorts are at all time high - 38,700.
For those who think there's going to be a short squeeze should do their homework.  Daily trade volume is close to 680k.  That means a short ratio of only 5%, too small for a short squeeze.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:57:15
New money.
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:14:51
Ah .... ok, understood.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:18:25
We can only hope.  
Unfortunately, when BTC price hovers, the more likely thing that can happen is a drop ... to a level where there's volume and new money.  That has not happened yet.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:43:27
As an average BTC investor, I say Yes.  The simple fact is that nobody knows how a trade war will impact BTC (anyone claiming otherwise is BS).
I have already sold more than half of my stocks and it's mostly in cash deposits.  I'm now selling my BTC.  Reason is simple - build up cash reserves to take advantage of further dips in stocks.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:11:14
Not so sure.  Look at stock - the smart money comes in at last two hours of trading day and drive prices down.  
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:09:06
Lol ...
I don't think that making a claim that there is indeed a "bigger picture" will hide your ignorance :).
Ok kid, I think you have exhausted your list of googled hyperbole so please go to sleep before you mum yells for you.
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:51:21
Nothings for certain here bro.
Crazy stuff happens.  $350 down in minutes, $1,000 up in less than half hour.
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:01:50
Dude, most of the volume for the last 2 days are FAKE.
It's a massive pump using Verge to wash trade.  If it doesn't induce new cash inflows as intended and the pump stops, the result will be ... quite obvious.
So let's not be too certain of anything.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:10:54
Why should I?  
You have already contradicted yourself since you declared "sky high prices all the time".
Gosh, you really are a moron.
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:28:29
It's called FOMO and there are plenty of morons peddling that.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:47:28
Lol ... sure :).
So a pseudo currency that is created from thin air (like fiat), with it's value speculated on unregulated exchanges and traded around by a niche group will change the global economic model?   
Look, the speculation is fun, I have made some money but let's not kid ourselves about it's impact or value.
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:50:15
Shouldn't you be equally stressed that the price might drop to below $1k a year from now?
The chance of that happening is the same as it doubling.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:18:57
Come on ... BTC dropping 60% in 3 months is safer than USD dropping 2% in 1 year?
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:30:08
Well, your post shows that you are just a novice with money you can't afford to lose and a foul mouth.
Grow some balls - if you can't deal with a meagre $300+ swing, don't play.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:31:24
It's not too late since it has dropped 55%.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:55:35
If dollar's role as a reserve currency ends, it's the end of the American economy (which is fuelled by debt).  We are talking hyperscale inflation, recession and massive increase in unemployment.
I wish you wouldn't make such suggestions lightly.
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:16:38
If that happens, it's not just coinbase but every exchange based in the US.  
But I very much doubt that an outright ban will happen.  A more likely scenario is that the NY investigation is able to prove that an exchange is complicit in fraudulent practises such as price manipulation or money laundering.  In such cases, yes - the government does have the authority to seize all assets the exchange owns. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:59:47
He actually thinks he can read the market.
Oh well, it is true that the price has been rather positive since he bought in Ester and is looking at this with tinted glasses. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:02:23
Exactly that.  
Shorts got rekked but that doesn't mean there was a short squeeze.  If you don't know what a short squeeze is, go look it up.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:03:23
A $300+ climb or drop is very common.
I was expecting to find people with good experience here.  Disappointing.

At 8.2 ... seriously?
I'm pretty undecided as I usually buy only during dips.  Furthermore, I'm still down on my stocks.
But then again, the price has been above 8k for most of this year (except last 2 weeks).
Sigh ... decision, decision ..

What resistance?  BTC is below every major indicator.
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:03:39
Once the whales have finished unloading, the price will crash, there will be a lot of hodlers and interest of the public will move on to other speculative assets.  
In the meantime, the very same whales have started hoarding other alts which they will pump to record ATH soon.  Cycle repeats.
My frank and honest opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:58:07

Lol ... don't jinx it.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:39:36
You are putting the cart before the horse.
All these speculation is causing the price to be volatile, which in turn is killing adoption as a currency.  You guys need to stop thinking you can have both.
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:31:01
ROFL!  Dude .... BTC has not even been around for a decade.  And frankly, anyone who can make the claims you made just shows how naive you are.
Anyway, you are on record that BTC will be above 10k next Friday.  As much as I would like to see that happen, I can forgo the $ just to see you wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:00:42
The price of every crypto (including BTC) is based 100% on speculation.
So any debate on whether one coin is overpriced relative to another coin is just pure baloney.
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:26:29
Sorry mate.  But putting retirement money into BTC is a really, really bad idea.  This is just a speculation game and you should be playing only with money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:52:52

Not earth shaking but definitely not upwards.

Where BTC is concerned, it's in the dump phase.

@_date: 2018-04-13 03:22:47
Nah, I'm quite conservative on shorts.
If it goes to 8k, I'm cutting my loss.
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:24:09
Oh, I'm in for the ride.  
Just need to be realistic on what we are doing :)

@_date: 2018-04-10 03:25:20
No, it is and has always been all about money.
And the whales are not hoarding - that was the pre-ATH phase.  Now, it's all about dumping in the most effective way - pump &amp; dump.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:39:36
drop to a level where there's solid volume and recover from there.

You can have balls and be a retard at the same time.  Just like you. 
Anyway, if you haven't already figured out, the upcoming regulations is going to clean up this mess and unfortunately, crash BTC while doing it.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:37:49
War?  Nah.  If governments feel that cryptos challenge their control of money, they will just ban it.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:59:11
Russia and China are just tired of the dollar hegemony (everyone outside of America is) and yes, this, together with yuan denominated oil are their way of pushing back.
But America going back to gold standard is not going to happen.  The entire American economy is fuelled by debt and a gold standard dollar will mean hyper inflation and instant annihilation of the American economy.  It doesn't take an economist to tell you that.
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:11:06
Only a moron will be holding cash thinking it's an 'investment'.  Investors put their money into assets which deliver returns higher than inflation.  
So your comparing BTC to cash as investment vehicles is retarded.  
The intrinsic value of cash is the convenience it offers as a currency because it's widely accepted.  Which was what BTC was designed for and failed.
You obviously have little investment experience other than reading and regurgitating from google so stop muddying the water.

Surely you are aware that in this forum, most people wants to see things ONLY in a positive light, no matter how ridiculous.  Its a classic syndrome of people trapped in a bubble and can't see outside of it.
When there's a $1,000 pump, it's "organic" and when there's a $300 drop, there's an uproar about price manipulation.  Being retarded takes on a whole new level here with declarations that fiat is doomed but same authors crap their pants when there's less fiat for each BTC.
Anyway, it's just entertainment, don't take it too seriously and enjoy the wild rides.

@_date: 2018-04-10 22:30:21
Dude, all cryptos are the same - it's a number on a network and people are assigning values purely based on speculation.
When this bubble burst, you will come to a realisation of how silly it is to pay thousands of $ of your hard earned cash for a number.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:51:36
No doubt.  And possible double that with time or crash to half.
My point isn't whether BTC is valuable or not but rather, that the volatile price makes it a risky proposition compared to the dollar.  
Then again, no pain no gain :)

I mean ... what's the maths here?

"All the time"?  Strange way to describe an asset that has depreciated 50% in 4 months.  Or has crashed by over $1k within a day multiple times during this period.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:57:24
It's not shorting, he got it the wrong way round.
It's long positions on margins.  When price drops, long positions on margins get liquidated and selling is forced by the exchange.  Which creates more selling pressure.
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:21:30
Was cheaper a few days ago.
To be frank, I'm kind of unnerved as BTC has been a little less predictable recently.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:41:36
Sorry dude, wrong forum.

@_date: 2018-04-12 03:07:58
I don't think the current sellers are those who bought at ATH.  
More likely, they are those who bought at a lower price way before ATH.  If you look at the top 1,000 wallets, they started accumulating way back in 2013.
As for buyers, it depends obviously on whether they think it will go up.  I do - that's why I bought a couple of days ago.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:43:07

No difference.  If x is the price change:
5x X 2 = 2x X 5 = 10x.  
With 10k, your account is cleaned out when:
a.  Price drop by $1k when you go long.
b.  Price increase by $1k when you go short.
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:24:34
Haha!  Mine was around 250 (+/- 50).  I remember that number simply because 1 molly = 0.2 BTC :P.  
It wasn't even a conscious "investment" ... was holding it to buy stuff.  Yeap .. BTC really was used as a currency then.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:35:49
Wrong.  It has spiked only twice - 2013 and 2017.  
It's already proven that the spike in 2013 was manipulated and went into bear territory for years till the 2nd spike.  That's the reason why we are again in bear territory after the 2nd spike.
Maybe in another 4 years, there will be a 3rd spike.  Till then, we will remain in bear if history is to repeat itself.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:39:05
Yes, the dollar is just a printed piece of paper and BTC is just a computer generated number.
Only difference is that the dollar happens to be the currency accepted for products and services and BTC is not.

@_date: 2018-04-10 15:26:07
Gosh .... the amount of self-validation.
BTC is a digital token, it too is 'magically' created, just like the other 1,700 alts.  If you think that the artificially induced cost of mining gives it value, you are wrong - it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:22:36
You are correct - the tech and BTC's function as a currency will work fine at any price.  Even at $10, the number in circulation will fulfil the purpose.
Most in this forum (including me) are just playing speculation and trying to make money.  Even hodlers are doing the same - hoping that some day the price will sky rocket.  All of this activity has nothing to do with what BTC is designed for - a currency.
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:40:46
Two groups - (a) people who bought below 8.8k and (b) short sellers.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:26:11
Sure, there are people who live beyond their means, spending money they don't have using debt.
But what has that got to do with BTC?  Oh, you mean there are people out there willing to loan out their BTCs with no interest?  Why don't you loan me yours?
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:36:50
I leave it to you guys to decide what will happen when Gemini/Nasdaq starts to detect and publicise all the obvious price manipulations on bitfinex, binance, etc.

It's fine when people want to profit.  Isn't that what you were doing drawing silly charts and proclaiming about BTC's worth in ...... USD?
Then you come here in this thread taking a dump about how the world financial system is disgusting.  The very same frigging system you are using to measure the worth of BTC.
You are not only a hypocrite but a moron as well.

Sure.  
And you buy these goods and services using a currency that is acceptable to the seller, which happens to be .... dollars.  
Why?  Because the same seller, have to pay it's tax in dollars, pay it's suppliers in dollars and report it's financial performance in dollars.
This is the reality, bro.  If you happen to be living in a life that is different, let me know.
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:34:43
Lol ... actually, that is what's happening in the stock market - bots trying to outsmart other bots and the market.  
90% of trading there is carried out by bots.  It's basically an AI war in there.  It has gotten so complex that humans no longer understand the reason for some of the phenomena like sudden changes in trading patterns during the last two hours.
And I believe most of that tech was brought into the crypto exchanges.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:25:32
You know very well the probably of that happening is close to zero.
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:55:03
A large base is only relevant if it can be monetised.  E.g. FB and Google - advertising revenues.  ANT Financials - fees from payment services.
Even if BTC has a billion users, it's still zero if it generates $0 per user.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:48:59
Dude, there was no short squeeze.  Trade volume is high enough to cover all the shorts.
Yes - shorts got rekked - 15,000 down.  Given the pace, probably margin calls.  But there's still 25,000 short.
Anyway, I dissolved my longs and shorted at 7700 :)
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:55:36
That's the point - it didn't and the facts are there no matter how many times you want to insist.
The first spike 2013 crashed for years and did not recover till 2017.
Remove the first spike since it was manipulated and you are left with only the Dec 17 spike as a reference.  Which many believe is also manufactured using Tether.
That's why many people believe it's a bubble and the chart is showing clearly that the bubble is deflating.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:41:49

That is absolutely UNTRUE.  FUD.
It is gambling in a rigged casino. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:57:39
Lol ... everyone had a conspiracy theory when the price dropped by $300 but no one is asking when it shoots up $1,000 :)
Anyway, it's due to large purchases of close to 40,000 BTCs on Bitfinex within a 30min span.
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:20:15
Well, the choice is only there if merchants price their goods and services in BTC (or whatever cryptos).  But they aren't, so BTC is just another glorified token.
As is, BTC's "price" is limited to the small group of speculators.
It's a nice game, I enjoy trading it.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves :)

I sold because it was declining.  Why am i the reason?
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:33:55
On the contrary, I believe there is big time manipulation happening.  But not in the form of setting up walls.  The STORM and Verge pumps were very obvious examples.
In fact, I believe that the HK based exchanges (bitfinex, binance, etc) are working closely with the whales on this.  
Now, this is the rumour - it's all controlled by the Chinese triads.  That's why the Chinese government stepped in and ordered them out of HK.  Don't shoot me for FUD ... as I said, it's just rumours here in Asia.
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:21:04
Oh, believe me - there's no information that I want or need from you.

It is a digital token, dude.  That's all it is.
Now, I'm not saying it won't rise in price but it's all speculation money.
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:01:55
No doubt.  But $300m in less than an hour, just when shorts are peaking is well, .... hard to believe it's unintentional.  Not complaining though.  
Also noticed that the volume is picking up after the peak.  Maybe it's my turn to get melted :P
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:33:23
Sorry guys, but I'm selling.  A 6.5% profit over 2 weeks is good enough for me.
We are going nowhere with this small pump/horizontal/drop routine.  I will buy in later if it goes down to 6.5/6.6.
Edit:  Sold - 7,120.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:16:02
I agree that fiat are digital tokens, generated from thin air like cryptos.  
The difference is that the world's products and services are priced based on fiat and that is what gives fiat it's value.  It's really that simple once you see pass the hype.
And if you think wasting electricity gives value to BTC, well .. you are clueless about how the economy works.
@_date: 2018-04-12 04:00:24
Short squeeze at 5% short ratio?

@_date: 2018-04-13 06:11:07
Dude, short sellers bring liquidity into the market.  No doubt we can argue that they are the bad guys rooting for a lower price but as proven, they can be wrong and get rekked.
As long as there's trade, whether long or short, will involve a buyer and seller and money flows through BTC.  That is what is good for the market unless you want to see it stagnant.
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:16:23
Lol ... you do have a tendency to overrate your opinions.
I think most people are still wondering about the $350 drop from nowhere when it was climbing steadily from 6.85 towards 7.2.  
You got a chart to explain this?  Or you got only "happy and positive hype" charts?
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:08:04
Rubbish.  The bulk of BTC volume is wash traded using other cryptos like Tether and now Verge.

Anyone got any hypothesis on why BTC is still hovering after the 6.5k crash?  
This seems very different from previous crashes (10k on 17 Jan, 6k on 2 Feb, 7.5k on 10 Mar).  In all these previous crashes, BTC recovered very quickly.
Any guesses will be appreciated.
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:25:08
Come on.  Even at $10, there's $180m in circulation.

@_date: 2018-04-12 04:42:56
Yes, at 6650.  And I will continue to buy at every 50 drop below that.
So yes, I have a vested interest to see the price move either way.

It works and has worked well for a long time.
The only looneys walking around preaching for a change are mostly hypocrites wanting to profit from a price surge.  Chances of that happening - Zero.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:42:47
Ok ... but to trade 40,000 BTCs to wipe out 15,000 short?
Unless you are suggesting that the 40,000 are not real (wash traded) and the intent is to get the shorts to cover their 15,000 for real?
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:37:49
Congress?  I think they got to pretend to do more important things :)
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:35:23
Because the current price on your exchange is higher and people will prefer to sell to buyers who are offering higher price.
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:14:32
Yeap.  Just like the other bunch of stupid fuckers who had to cover their positions at 8,130.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:43:07
Won't, not can't.
Well, since you are so insistent, my view is that it will (a) crash again to below 6.5k and (b) will not go higher than $11.4k before that.
Therefore, at current price, the upside simply isn't worth it.  
Let's not pretend there's any rationale or maths to it.  The bottomline is that the price of BTC is 100% speculative and there's zero basis for any price.
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:27:11
Don't understand?  Everything looks obvious in hindsight.
People who bought at ATH thought that it will continue going up.
Just like people buying now, thinking that $6.9k is cheap because it will go back to $19k.
It might not and the price might sink to $1k.  Then I guess, people in future will be asking "why did those people buy at $6.9k when it's obvious that it's on a decline".
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:26:32

Dude, these are just bots adjusting to the market.  
E.g., a bot that originally put up buy order at 6800 may take it down (may be partially filled) and re-price it at 6750 if it sees a large build-up of sell orders.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:35:42
Lol .... so there are people who are grounded in reality here :).
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:49:52
Talk about obvious price manipulation.
Verge - $1.3B traded on a market cap of $1B.  It's the same coins wash traded over and over.
Most of these wash trading are through XVG/BTC.  In other words, BTC's price is artificially sustained and most of the volume is not real.
So next time anyone says there's $B of trading in BTC, think again.  It's an artificial market.

Absolutely ... as high as possible before dumping it in stages, which is where we are now after ATH.
I do not think anyone will dispute that the run up last year to $20k was staged and manipulated.  The problem is that with so much attention now, whether it can be pulled off again.
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:21:25
Look, instead of all these silly arguments about 'failures of government', etc, let's look at reality - a lot of money that went into BTC is due to the equities bubble.  People felt rich and willing to take risks in a volatile market like cryptos.  I am one of them.
If stock market crashes, people will be licking their wounds and unwinding from high risk investments like BTC.  So you think that's good or bad for BTC?  
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:30:32
You guys keep thinking in terms of resistance and support, which is bullshit in cryptos.
The price is manipulated by the whales, period.  They don't need sky high prices - all they need is volatility and their partner-in-crime (the exchanges), need the volume.
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:25:56
I think you are confusing him further.
Assuming that BTC is $10k and his initial fund is $10k.  In which case, he can:
a.  Short 1 BTC (1x leverage, 100% equity)
b.  Short 2 BTC (2x leverage, 50% equity)
c.  Short 4 BTC (4x leverage, 25% equity)
Assuming 0% maintenance, he loses his $10k when:
a.  BTC reach $20k with 1 BTC
b.  BTC reach $15k with 2 BTC
c.  BTC reach $12.5k with 4 BTC
Anyway, he can't lose more than $10k.  Exchanges will impose a maintenance margin (e.g. bitfinex is 15%).  In which case, no matter how much he has leveraged, the exchange will liquidate and force sell when he loses $8,500.  Bitfinex's max leverage is 40% equity or 2.5x.
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:05:34
I frankly do not see how speculating in BTC will address the issues you are talking about.
All your ranting about "predatory financial systems" and here you are, participating in a system where exchanges, ICOs and whales are collaborating on wholesale price manipulations and 'pump and dump'.
Anyway, go on believing whatever fantasies you want.  
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:18:02
Don't know, buddy.  Maybe they, like us, were expecting the price to recover to higher level.
I sold my original batch at 17k when it started declining.  Some of my other friends are still hanging on, some believes this is the best price and selling now.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:06:39
They don't have to shut down the network nor do they need to take it away from you.  But they can make it illegal and some of the governments have done so: 
I doubt if this will be wide spread but if cryptos starts to threaten government's control, it's not difficult for them to make it illegal.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:20:52

And based on what you are writing, I can tell that you are clueless on stocks other than cut &amp; paste from the web.  In fact, I can even quote where you have read them :).
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:05:42
It means that there aren't enough sellers in the market when short sellers try to close their position.  When this happens, short sellers are forced to buy at higher price which pushes the overall market price higher.  
Usually happens when there's a sudden upswing in price, which results in margin calls and short sellers don't have the money to top up.
Unlikely to happen in BTC because the volume of shorts is very low and shorts can be closed quite easily.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:40:58
To answer your question, the only relevant attribute that BTC has is it's brand value.  As the tech is open sourced, there are plenty of alts that are actually almost identical.
And while there is a lot of speculation activities on cryptos, I very much doubt they are used in real world applications at the moment.  
Yes, there are plenty of noise about BTC being the currency of the future, alternative to gold, etc but most of it are just hyperbole to justify the "value" of BTC.  Take away the noise and BTC is just a number generated on the network and any value that people put on that number is pure speculation.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:47:37
No idea, mate.  I think the important points are (a) concentration of ownership remains high (whales) and (b) unregulated exchanges.
As long as these two points remain true, price of BTC will not collapse.
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:29:26
That's probably because he doesn't like the real answer.
Which is that there is no differentiation between BTC and the alts from technical and functional perspectives and the only intangible difference is BTC's brand value.
The answer really is that simple.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:40:08
Why do you think so?  I frankly don't think BTC is predictable to any reasonable extent in the short term.

Here it comes ...
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:46:24
Yes, of course.  But with a max 2.5x and 15% maintenance like on bitfinex, it's unlikely to happen.  And frankly if it does, good luck to the exchanges trying to recoup the money.

If you are trying to say I'm a poor trader, at least follow my posts.
My last position was 6650 so it's pretty good profit at 7700.
Current short is at 7700, which is in the red.
Well, my bank account says I'm a pretty decent trader.  Are you one of the salty hodler who's still waiting for the moon?
