There are many proven business models for open source companies, from support subscriptions &amp; professional services to hosted service offerings.   The starting point for all of them was to build something remarkable first and then look for ways to commercialize.

I like to know who's behind the brokerages I give my money to..

No one was excluded - While these are the initial launch partners, they are not the only partners in Liquid. If you are a customer of Bitstamp, you should contact them to see if and when this is in their plans.

We’ve taken care to remove ourselves from any authority beyond the design, setup, and maintenance of the system for the functionaries -- we do not have access to any private keys or customer funds.

Essentially - There's solids, there's gases, and Liquid is somewhere in the middle. :P

Today, a host of liquidity inefficiencies hinder the overall prospects of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Liquid Protocol addresses a specific set of business use-cases that do not occur now due to the particular nature of bitcoin the asset.
The types and kinds of activity that Liquid enables are not possible with activity on the main chain without having explicit trust in a counterparty. As such, Liquid is a strict improvement over explicit trust in a single party.

its prudent to be conservative when it comes to blocksize

Since the exchanges share the same liquidity pool in Liquid, they can eliminate the time tied up “waiting for confirmations”, as all exchanges do now.  Some wait 2 confirmations, others 6 -- both excessive lengths of time to have capital “locked” in place under volatile market conditions.

It's simply a matter of the right trust model for the right situation.
Exchanges are looking for near-instantaneous transfer of bitcoin already explicitly collateralized &amp; secured on the blockchain amongst themselves. This type of activity, which Liquid enables, is not possible on the main chain without having explicit trust in a counterparty. As such, Liquid is a strict improvement.

No. In our model, an individual participant has no say in which transactions are included beyond whether they are valid or not.  A functionary cannot censor or otherwise control how the Liquid protocol is used, beyond granting their users access, or not.

yes - we ship a tamper-resistant, physical box to each participant.

JD here, Strategy at Blockstream:
Trust is already a key component in day-to-day exchange operations.
Functionaries use a hardened box that stores an autonomous, private-key holding program that signs new blocks in accordance with the protocol. We distribute these boxes to each of the functionaries, but they have zero access or control over the rules that are enforced inside of them. These boxes are designed to self-destruct if opened or otherwise tampered with, and if enough functionaries go down, Liquid halts. In addition, updates to the system require supermajority consensus.
In our conversations with the initial launch customers and the other dozen or so interested parties, these security features are not a stumbling block over the stability or reliability of the system.
