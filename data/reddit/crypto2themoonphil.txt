Care to explain how it works or how they got my numbers? I keep pretty tight security. Not trying to clutter the sub with this but if I am on it everyday and haven't heard of the scam I am sure many other people haven't. It's important to keep everyone safe from these scams if we want mainstream adoption. I couldn't imagine pretty much anyone I know would easily click on it and be phished.

anyone that is able to break localbitcoins and redirect the forum site to a phishing site know to not connect the stolen bitcoin straight to an exchange. These bitcoin are gone forever from the original owners

I sell digital accounts for games and gold and I only use cryptocurrency. Huge websites like sythe and playerauctions the top dealers tend to only like using this because it is hard to prove the transfer of digital products and PayPal charge backs are a huge issue. Millions of transaction paying for these goods are done daily; however we of course we to get back to buying the cup of coffee from the store to truly make bitcoin the currency it was meant to be.

Sounds like you do. Why would someone be an idiot if they thought it’d stay at 20k? You are calling people idiots justify yourself. You think it is a shitty assets why? Expand because your comment adds no value and is just shitting on people for no reason.

I’ve seen most people encourage use just to rebuy the amount you spend is the popular thinking in this sub and all crypto.

Yeah I mean it’s not everyone cup of tea but the point are still relevant. I don’t know why Peterson fan boys are downvoting me he asked for information why people dislike him so I was sharing information on why. Figures though can’t say anything bad about poppa Peterson.
