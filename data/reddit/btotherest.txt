That is why you don't short an index that has a strong upwards trend. 
And speaking of risk, you don't know risk if you say shorting the S&amp;P is too risky but buying bitcoins isn't. Volatility is key.

What? haha, try;
"To me the S&amp;P isn't risky. I have long term faith in the S&amp;P." 
 
To me Tulips isn't risky. I have long term faith in tulips.

What? Resist to replace 'gold' with 'bitcoin'? Was that a joke OP?

[A tip for you and OP and many others]( Save the comment just for the sake of it  to prove me wrong if you plan to stick with it at this point. Im not saying that bitcoins are bad but if your interest is speculation, i'd move the money to fiat, and watch how it plays out. That's how you learn your lesson - without getting (more) hurt.

Just know that it can go MUCH lower, could you handle a drop to $12? If you don´t have a belly-ace and can sleep even if that where to happen then fine, but that would not be a strange think, especially since it's somewhat made to be self stabilizing. 3 month ago it was at 14.2

**The real question isn’t whether Bitcoin will falter, plummet or take us all on a crazy ride, it’s whether it will actually survive its inevitable test. If it does, even at very low values, it will change the way we think about stores of value, finance and the independence of the virtual economy.**

well, technically it's in some investors portfolio and bought and sold
