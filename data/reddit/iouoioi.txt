at least from you i would have expected to go through the effort and read through the short discussion i had with btcisgod in the other thread [so I wouldn't have to repost everything here]( :(
the fact that a so-called "programmer" of the core team wrongly *insisted* that bitcoin doesn't check *at all* if files exist before reading them and even made up a story about crashes which should be impossible according to the code should let your alarm bells ring.
maybe you do want to look at this in depth?
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:47:28
pretty embarrassing, eh?
[the code does literally exactly what i guessed it would lol](
are you sure is a real programmer and not just someone hanging out with them to be cool?
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:31:16
haha i don't want to think about it because it's just too absurd. i agree that most likely he's just mental.
I know i should feel sorry for him now but i really hate stupid people who are smug and arrogant assholes.
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:20:01
what, why?
the devs are already working on that, I'm just giving an example of how you can already do your part to support the network and what you should and shouldn't do when doing this until their work is finished.

uhm the index already contains everything, there are no parts that weren't included in the index apart from stuff like signatures and luke's prayers.
and yes i know reindexing requires the blockchain to be on the disk, that's not part of the discussion here...
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:35:21
so, did you figure out how this code crashes bitcoin on your computer?
this seems like really serious bug.
are you sure your kernel isn't infected with some sort of aggressive malware?
can you please set a breakpoint and tell us where exactly it crashes?
i really hope you didn't make that up because that would be really embarrassing, not just for you but for bitcoin in general, and definitely a reason to kick you right away.
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:42:32
I'm running a full one myself but as you can see in the screenshot i posted i already tested it, and i ran a crippled one for months ages ago when i didn't have the diskspace.
just run "testnet in a box" and attack yourself, duh.
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:57:52
[38793 told a lie, here's the code](
you don't need any experience to see that bitcoin does indeed check if blocks exist so nothing goes wrong.
you will not find any programmer who will disagree with me here. even gmaxwell stopped trolling.
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:09:41
but you do have all blocks! you just delete them after indexing.
miners (or regular nodes) don't usually need to access the blk block files. that's why they are indexed in the first place!
edit: [see here](
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:11:44
those are mine and no, not using any other accounts and I'm not using those two anymore either after some really smart people thought they could persuade math to change its mind through voting :D
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:53:56
are you seriously saying that miners crawl through the entire blockchain everytime someone makes a transaction AND that stackexchange is wrong in such a detailed answer as i linked?


i think i would have noticed the hard drive load if you were right :/
i guess blocks are only needed to verify signatures which is only done once because merkle magic.
sorry for the slow replies, negative karma :(
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:08:44
oh, do electrum servers not need to download the entire blockchain?
and do electrum servers share new blocks and transactions with the rest of the network?
that's cool and would ofc make my suggestion superfluous. link to source of what you just said please and I'll edit the threads.
wish someone would have said that right away lol.
edit: k den.
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:31:41
yeah tough decision because as we all know math is heavily influenced by belief.
did i miss some memo? is today opposite day? act like a retard day? is this some sort of raid? were all accounts hacked and I'm the only one who isn't affected because i create a new one everyday?
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:22:27
wow, thanks, this is awesome info. i noticed the same problem with my tor relay.
maybe it's time for me to finally figure out how to install OpenWRT.
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:35:39
...beg your pardon? how are they putting a load on the network starting up?
nodes share blocks while starting up which means they will be sharing while leeching. and there's the torrent download to get started.
and because of the huge amount of crippled nodes the full nodes won't have to share so many current blocks which means they can devote their bandwidth to bootstrapping cripples.
and keeping the last few months' blocks only requires a few hundred MB so if people use the torrent to bootstrap their cripples they can get the rest of the blocks from other cripples...
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:21:02
me neither, i just looked at it because wouldn't stop spreading lies.
but merkle trees are made so if you change one part of them you have to change all subsequent parts too, that much i know.
pretty sure the indexed txs do not get changed.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:17:23
that database does not get updated except through new blocks.
anything else would be a reindex. one does not simply modify a merkle tree.
(I'm just guessing but i can look it up but it wouldn't make sense...)
is that the last obstacle or do you have more? :p
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:58:07
heh, I'm not the one running around like a rhino on PMS.
why do you guys hate crippled nodes in the first place?
if they are so bad why can't anyone say why they are bad? why does a core developer have to resort to lies? why does a core developer's fanboy spam alt accounts to rig votes?
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:04:18
to clarify: i explicitely asked him if he was talking about the following situation:
- he indexed then deleted blk***.dat files from the beginning of the chain
- no api/console commands or other weird things involved
- a client requests a block from him
- crash????
i thought once we had established whether this is perfectly safe and would never crash we could start moving forward and see how far we can go but something must have made click in his brain.
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:43:57
no, he said multiple times that as soon as a peer requests a block everything will crash and that he tested it and it crashed his client.
i know that getblock and probably some other api calls will let it crash but that's not part of the discussion here as we're just talking about running a simple node for rebroadcasting transactions and blocks and mining on p2pool.
maybe, if no risks are found, it could even be used as a regular wallet. we should check out what rescans do, but as i said they don't require reindexing so they should work fine and it's easy to test on testnet anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:28:02
from the 7000 full nodes that are currently running... or the torrent file... wtf are you trying to say here?
and if people here didn't behave like dicks and we could have an actual evaluation of the potential issues there wouldn't be any need of a disclaimer because simple code is not unpredictable.
[check out this thread btw](
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:27:20
[yes, of course, in the fucking screenshot i spammed all over the threads :D](
i already tested that last time gmaxwell went nuts. didn't change his opinion though, because *he was* crashing. or so he said.
i wonder if he is getting paid off by some company providing thin clients or ewallets or whatever but that would just be too crazy but i can't see why he started this all out crusade against crippled nodes.
doesn't he have a reputation to lose?
anyway, he's gone a bit quiet since i dug up that code proving him wrong.
[seems like someone *was* anticipating idiots like me after all :p](
