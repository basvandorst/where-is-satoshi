AHAHAHA! Right, because the government-backed currency has worked soo well in the past.


This is the biggest hurdle in Bitcoin adoption. Unfortunately there's going to have to be a third-party solution to solve this problem. I don't like centralization, but it's the only way to make Bitcoin easy to use. Take Linux for example; it took many years before centralized organizations came along that made it easy for users to use (e.g., Ubuntu).

By "exchange caboodle" I am guessing you mean verification requirements. If so, LocalBitcoins.com is one of the most anonymous and easiests way to do it; but you will have to go through a few sellers because most don't sell that much. I've seen at most somewhere between the $5-10K.

No, you're not late. Bitcoin is still in its early stages. Not many businesses accept bitcoin yet. Out of the millions of businesses, only a small fraction of a fraction accept it. You're still early.
I would say that Bitcoin is the best coin to invest in because it is the most widely known coin of all the crypto-coins. You also get better support (i.e., exchanges, software, acceptance).

Using Tor and a VPN that is not in the USA will help keep you anonymous.
Some concerns come to mind in regards with your setup:
1. If you have connected an email with your Blockchain.info account, then it can be traced. Also, your IP address is logged on their servers every time you visit their website. I recommend you use a software wallet instead.
1. Unless you mined the coins, your transactions will not be anonymous because they can be traced to the place you bought them from (e.g., Coinbase, Bitstamp, or any other exchange).

Count me in too!
Here's my address: 1K47NT2JZVCm47Yn7cBztdmr3kmHxeJxHp
**Initial review:** This review is written as the thoughts occured to me.
* Wow, beautiful icon. It is quite unique. I love the golden-yellow colour!
* Let me try adding some users. Wow, you can add users via bluetooth!? Perhaps this will be my go-to recommendation wallet for friends and family. Focusing on users is much easier than addresses.
* The home screen seems self-explanatory for someone new to Bitcoin. I wonder if they will know what the QR and camara icon do?
* Let me try scanning a QR-code address. That works. Let me try scanning a private key QR-code. Sweet, that works too! 
* What does that box icon at the top do? App store? Oh, you can add more function to Hive. Awesome.
* Let's see what's under the menu icon. "Safety," hmm, that's really good item to list first, especially for new users.
* I do miss the ability to look at individual keys or generate new ones. It would be nice to be able to look at the private keys as well.
* This is definitely a begginer's wallet. I will be recommending this to new users.
**Final thoguhts:** 
* As another user already mentioned, I searched for "hive wallet" but it was still the 5th result. Some SEO is definitely recommended!
* I really enjoy Mycelium and Blockchain.info wallets as they offer more features that Hive does not. For example:
* A PIN code to protect the wallet in case the phone is stolen.
* Ability to add a watch-only address, generate individual addresses, or look at the private keys.
* The app is boring. It needs some colour. Although I do love the simplicity.
* The backup process could use improvement. It would be really awesome if it could connect to a desktop app and create backups there via bluetooth or wi-fi. Backing up on the phone by default is not recommended.
* After the first backup, a new user may not know what the "archive" button is. They may just ignore it and leave the backup on their phone.

As the article mentioned, one of the bigger hurdles for Bitcoin is a lack of public relations.
The people don't know what it is or how to use it because they don't have access to the information. It's even being confused for M-PESA.
We need an agent to promote Bitcoin. Perhaps a small company that develops a program which people can easily use with their dumb-phones to text each other coins. Then advertises the heck out of it. It's a big opportunity here.
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:47:13

1) There is no need to register an ID. You only need a wallet to hold your bitcoins. Just go to  and download the Electrum wallet.
You can buy bitcoins from  if you're in the US.
2) Once you buy some bitcoins, transfer them to your wallet. That's where you will store them.
3) The best way to earn bitcoins is the same way you earn other currencies, by exchanging a service or selling a product. Forget about mining for now. Focus on learning more about Bitcoin first. Especially about security and how it works.

BIP-38 wallets are fantastic because you can protect your private key(s) with a password. 
If you do decide to print your keys on a paper wallet, make sure you print at least three copies. Keep the copies in different locations. Why? Because paper is so fragile.
@_date: 2014-09-20 01:10:20
My private keys are stored offline in BIP38 encrypted format. They were generated with an offline computer. My spending wallet is only accessible with 2FA. It's possible to access my keys, but it's much more difficult than a bank.
I asked the bank representative how it's possible that my account been compromised twice in such a short period of time. He replied that sometimes that "just happens, they can generate card numbers." He said that the fastest he saw a fradulent charge was before they even sent a new card out to the customer it already had a charge. It's so frustrating spending 40 minutes each time. 
I keep best practices. I can see no reason of my own that I caused my account to be less secure. Sometimes breaches just happen like it did with Target and Home Depot recently. At least with Bitcoin there are no pull transactions.

We don't need regulation! And I really don't see how they possibly can regulate it.
They're going to push for silly AML laws that force exchanges to keep track of all customer's data, possibly trying to match public addresses to people's identities. But because it's open-source and global, there's no way that they can enforce that. Ultimately what they should do is just leave it alone.
 
Sometimes I wonder, do they really care? Do they actually believe they are helping save the world from drugs and terrorist? What is really going through these people's minds? Do they not see that the banks are even more of a threat?

A problem Bitcoin has had is terrible naming conventions. That was due to lack of foresight by the creators; which is understandable.
When bitcoin was first being traded, the price of a bitcoin was a few cents. Then when the price increased to a few hundred; so the bitcoin needed to be divided. That gave numerical values like:


The community tacked on SI units to try and make it simpler:






Some people adopted it, some didn't. All that was still too confusing so recently there's been a new naming convention that I've seen:

I disagree. Hardware wallets are not the best option for your average Joanne.
I see hardware wallets as an inelegant solution. The non-tech user is not going to want to buy another device just to store coins.
It's very likely that the solution is going to come from third parties maintaining a wallet for them. Similar to the service Coinbase provides right now.
The average buyer already trusts third parties all the time. It won't be difficult to make the transition. In fact, they won't even know they're using Bitcoin. Similar to how Linux is used today. It's used by many people by their devices (e.g. phones) and by the relative few as an alternative OS.
When thinking about solutions to security, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the non-tech users. Your grandmother, aunt, or sister, etc.
Think of the grand picture, the future. Five, or ten years down the line. Do you really see hardware wallets being ubiquitous, where the average joe is using it?
Edit: I see a trend towards convergence of devices. Your laptop, phone, and wallet will become one. I see people keeping their coins stored with a third party. It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out.

I know the feeling. Here's what helped me: allocate 10% of the paycheck to buying bitcoins. Then spread out your buys to every two weeks.

The "ask" price is the price people are *asking* to sell the bitcoin at. E.g., *Will you pay $350. for it?*
The "bid" price is the price people are bidding to buy at. E.g., *No, but I'll buy it for $345.*
So if you're looking to buy, you will be on the bidding side. Think of it as an auction where you and others are bidding for a bitcoin.
If you're on the selling side, you will be *asking* people to buy it at a certain price.
Ignore the colors because they may change per exchange.

1. Buy it at Coinbase. 
1. Go to 
 1. Download the website by clicking "GitHub Repository" on the bottom right.
 1. On GitHub, click on "Download ZIP" on the right.
1. Once you've saved the website, turn off your Internet connection.
1. Uncompress the file and run the "bitaddress.org.html" file.
1. Follow the process to generate a paper wallet.* 
1. Print the paper wallet on your offline computer. You should print multiple copies.
1. You can now transfer the coin to your paper wallet. Later when you want to redeem it you can use a wallet like Bockchain.info. Always remove the full amount from a paper wallet.
* You should learn more about paper wallets, how to redeem them, how to store them, and BIP38 encrypted wallets. Let me know and I'll write some more to explain it.
You can sell it again at Coinbase. You don't have to sell the full coin. You can sell half of it, or a quarter of it. A US Dollar is divisible by 100 (i.e., 1.00), whereas a Bitcoin is divisible by 100 000 000. (i.e., 1.00000000). So you could sell a fraction of a cent if you wanted to.
@_date: 2014-01-21 08:03:42
If by invest you mean buy some bitcoins, then you're best option is buy from Coinbase.com (only if you're in the US). You can also buy from Bitstamp (Europe based) or Coinjar.io (Australia).
Once you buy the coins, you can move them off the exchange and into your wallet. This is where security comes in. If you're not familiar with how to secure your wallet, then it's best to leave the coins in the wallet from where you bought them from.
Would you like to know more? Or do you have further questions?
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:59:44
There are some advantages to keeping coins in an online wallet for the average user: 2-factor auth. for login and transactions, no 'wallet.dat' to backup, user support is available if needed, and more.

The more bitcoins are used, the more common Bitcoin becomes as a payment system. I truly want Bitcoin to succeed, therefore I try to support the vendors that are accepting it whenever I can.
You can buy almost anything. I've bought flights [(CheapAir.com)]( hand lotion, made donations, purchased items off of Craigslist, and gift cards [(Gyft.com)]( that I use to purchase my groceries. You can look at [Coinmap.org]( to see if any local businesses accept it in your area.
If you're into Bitcoin to "free ride", then that's you're choice and I'm okay with that. However, I'm simply stating that the price would rise faster if free-riders did something about it.

It doesn't matter what will replace it. The USD will not be replaced overnight; but it will be replaced slowly. In fact, it's already being replaced. Look at all the other countries looking for ways to bypass the USD [(see BRICS and the USD)](
America stepped in deep shit when Nixon took the USD off the gold standard in 1971. It wasn't necessarily because gold was valuable, but because gold was limited. It was that limitation that kept the Federal Reserve from printing too many notes. Now it finds itself in even deeper shit because countries are starting to realise that those notes are worth less and less.

This is a very important issue; and it's really a computer security issue. Most users don't really understand how to properly secure their computer. If they can't even keep their computer from catching a virus, they're definitely not ready to secure their own finances on their home PC. Until the average home user can securely store their funds, Bitcoin as a currency will not be widely adopted.
Edit: I do believe, however, that the market will come up with a brilliant solution. For example, a hardware wallet that automatically backups an encrypted copy of the keys to an online backup service. Or a third-party taking securing the funds for you.

I am not saying that we should sit back and celebrate. We have many more obstacles ahead of us, and it seems they're coming mostly from government opposition.
One of the reasons I strongly believe in Bitcoin is because there are many intelligent people whom I have met and seen speak that are constantly working for a brighter future that involves bitcoin. It's we, the community, that together will get through the obstacles. If it were not for everyone else, I wouldn't be such a believer in Bitcoin. Myspace was centralized, Bitcoin is not.

Bitcoin is definitely the coin to be in right now simply because of the network effect. You have more people using Bitcoin than any other altcoin out there.

I don't think this will be an issue. If Bitcoin as a currency gets to the point where it's starting to replace old monetary systems, then that would mean it has solved one of its biggest hurdles: security. Specifically security at the level of a home-user. By then, it will be very easy to use that even the elderly will be able to use it.
Edit: Perhaps a third party will be able to keep their funds safe, then they will use a card to spend them. Or perhaps they will store funds on a hardware wallet. Who knows. My grandmother who doesn't even speak English, has learned how to use a smart phone. I believe it will be the same for Bitcoin.

The market will solve this issue. Hardware wallets may be introduced that automatically back up your encrypted keys to a web-service. Or perhaps a third-party will hold your funds online (maybe Amazon, or Ebay).


That wouldn't stop Bitcoin. Many would want to find out what Bitcoin is and that would cause a Streissand effect.

Bitcoin can be anonymous as long as the originating source is anonymous. If it's not, then you will have to mix your coins.

I'll share something I learned last year from a website called CoinLenders. This website offered incredible returns, I think it was 30% APY compounded daily. It worked flawlessly. I would keep all my bitcoins there because why have them sitting around doing nothing? Then the website was "hacked." I lost everything  I had in there. Luckily I had withdrawn most of my coins before this happened because I learned about security.

Government meddling (regulation) requires that Bitcoin exchanges know their customers (**K**now **Y**our **C**ustomer). That means asking them everything about who they are. If you decide to use Bitstamp, be prepared to give them all the information they ask for, which might involve passport, government issued ID, pictures, bank statements, origin of bitcoins, purpose of use, and maybe even a stool sample. Otherwise they will hold your funds until you do.

I'm guessing the reason Bitstamp is trusted is because they haven't fucked up. That's really what trust comes down to--if one can provide a functional product or service that works, even during times of stress. 
I don't know if there's anything else  they provide that makes them more trustworthy. They have a stable trading platform that has proved to work most of the time, people are able to deposit and withdraw without problems, and it's used by Coinbase,  the biggest bitcoin reseller in the US.

First, some wallets allow you to change your transaction fee. You can set it to zero, but the transaction may take longer in going through. Most wallets are set to a default transaction fee of .00001 to .000005 BTC. At the current Bitstamp prices that's approximately .04 to .08 USD.

Essentially all wallets consists of at least one public address and its associated private key.
Software wallets manage all your public adresseses and their private keys. You don't even have to think about the private keys with software wallets.
The way a paper wallet essentially works is you're simply printing out a **new** private key and the public address on a piece of paper. That's it. The reason behind this being that the private key won't be exposed to the Internet.
When you create the paper wallet, do so offline. Use  and follow instructions there.
Also, you will need to withdraw all funds from a paper wallet once you're ready to use them.

I'd say the answer to people's lack of security is to introduce them to an online wallet, similar to the one used by Coinbase. They store user's coins offline and in multiple locations. I believe that's the only way for now--to have a third party do it for them.
We are still in the early stages of Bitcoin so we haven't really figured out security yet. There will continue to be more thefts until we figure out the best way to solve this problem for the average user. There will never be complete security, but there will be strong imrpovements. Eventually people will be able to store their coins safely without too much effort.
We don't know exactly where this new technology will go. It could get to the point where people use Bitcoin without knowing they're even using it, like Linux (in Android phones). Maybe security wont even be such a big issue if that happens.
For now, just educate those around you and tell them to store their coins either with a trust-worthy online wallet, or to keep them on a clean dedicated device.

I'm somewhat ignorant as to who exactly is asking for regulation. Could you provide some examples?
The definition for *regulation* is so broad, it could mean many things. In some cases, regulation can actually be good for Bitcoin. For example, if governments regulate exchanges and hold them accountable for the money they lose or to make sure that they have all the funds they say they do.
Regulation can be very bad if it means it's going to prevent people from using it. For example, if the government says that banks cannot do business with companies dealing with Bitcoin. That is very very bad regulation.

Interesting graphics, but it's a bit outdated and mentions unecessary biased information:
* *"The largest Bitcoin exchange is Mt. Gox"*
It shouldn't promote a single exchange above others, especially not one where users may have trouble withdrawing their money.
* *"Fuels the dark web... to buy illegal drugs like... marijuana   "*
Bitcoin does not *fuel* anything. It's neutral. Just like the USD. Yes it's used there, but it's also used in many places worldwide for many legitimate purposes. Also, last time I checked, marijuana is not illegal in my state.

The price is not *fake.* The Mt. Gox exchange used to be the primary exchange for trading. It's one of the oldest exchanges. Last year however, the U.S. government froze Mt. Gox' US bank account and as a consequence prevented US customers to withdraw from their Mt. Gox accounts.

Although each wallet is different and each has its own set of vulnerabilities, I'd say that for the most part mobile wallets are secure when proper precautions are taken. Let's take a look at a few vectors of attack and weaknesses:
* **Theft / Physical security** - you should always have a password to your wallet in case your phone is ever stolen. Backups will help you recover your money. With online wallets like Blockchain.info and Coinbase, you could easily recover your funds. Wallets like Mycelium you'll have to backup your keys and email them to yourself. Luckily Mycelium makes it easy to do this.
* **Malware** - if you ever download a bad piece of software on your phone, your keys could easily be stolen. The best way to prevent this is to avoid pirated software. Stick to well known apps on the App Store and Play Store.
* **Accidental loss** - you should always keep encrypted backups, that way you can always recover from losing your phone, dropping it in the water, etc.
* **Badly programed wallet** - always test and familiarize yourself with the software you're about to use. Test it with a few cents. See what it offers and make sure there aren't any glitches. Look at the reviews.
If you follow this advice, you should be fine. For the most part, mobile wallets are secure enough to keep spending money in there. You wouldn't carry your life savings with you everywhere you go, would you? (Please don't store all your bitcoins on your phone).

Yes, if the phone breaks you will loose your coins, along with your pictures, music, and other important files.
But like all things digital, loss can be prevented with backups. Most wallets come with their own backup systems.
For example, the Greenaddress.it wallet has a *word seed* that you should memorise and write down to keep somewhere safe. Blockchain.info wallet has you create an account on their website, which then links to the wallet in your phone. So if you lose your phone, you will have access to it via their website.

It's not the best video out there, but it's a decent introduction to the problems of the USD.


The narrator didn't mean for people to actually save their money under their mattresses. He meant something more along the lines of "if people would be encouraged to hoard (save) money." If something increases in value, people are not going to want to give it away, unless they really want something. That is a very powerful and liberating idea. Imagine if people were able to retire on what they saved.
Edit: Also, no longer will people be encouraged to spend endlessly on things they don't need. Currently, people buy so much junk because they don't value USD as much. That leads to enlessly over-consumption and greed. Bitcoin can change that.

@_date: 2014-05-15 17:27:03
Definitely all valid concerns. For me, I don't see them as too much of a problem because I trust that the market will find a way to solve those issues. Explanations:
* (4) Concern number four: there is room for third party providers to fill this need. For example, escrow services will spring up and let people choose who they want as an escrow provider, instead of relying on the merchant. If people are worried about storage, there will be a trusted provider to store their funds (perhaps even a bank of sorts); or maybe a hardware wallet that automatically backups encrypted keys to a service. 
* (3) It's not a waste of energy, it is being used to sustain a very important financial system. I do agree though, it could be much lower though. However, this problem could be easily solved if society moves to renewable sources of energy. If the cost of energy becomes so high that it begins to cut into profits by the miners, they will look to invest in cleaner energy.
* (2) It may be bad now, but because Bitcoin is open source. It's very possible any issues may be solved; maybe even by the companies themselves. Instead of adding a reversal mechanism at the core level, why not build on top of it so users get the option to choose.
* (1) There's room for people of all types to take advantage of the opportunities in Bitcoin. Day traders can make money if they want. In fact, I encourage it because the price increases are what attract people to Bitcoin in the first place. That's what attracted me at first. Then I realised there was so much more.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:08:23
Yep, that is correct; your order will be filled at the price you bought it at (even if it is three days later).
Concerning storage, let me explain what that entails: 
First, when we talk about securely storing coins, what we really mean is keeping the private keys safe. Private keys are what allow you to spend your coins. A desktop wallet automatically manages the private keys for you.
Under no circumstances should you share private keys with anyone.
The safest way to keep coins safe is to print the private keys on an a piece of paper called a *paper wallet*. (See here for a thorough explanation on what exactly is a paper wallet:  ).
Second, never keep coins stored online (a.k.a. hot storage). Don't keep them on Coinbase or an exchange. Why? Well look at what recently happened with Mt. Gox. People kept their coins stored there. They trusted Gox with keeping private keys they never had access to. Then Gox faced some trouble and denied people their coins. In short, if you don't have access to the private keys, you don't really control your coins.
**TL;DR** Best practice is to keep the majority of your coins on a paper wallet and a small amount on a desktop wallet (I highly recommend Electrum).
Let me know if you'd like me to answer any questions you may have or clarify anything.
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:39:31
If meeting someone locally is not safe, and your government has made bank trasfers illegal, then I suppose your only choices are either travel outside the country, break the law, or change your government.

You should buy bitcoins because they are created at a predictable rate. You know how many will ever be created (21 million) and how often (25 every block, halving approximately every four years).
The USD in comparison, is created on the whim of the government and the private US central bank, which further devalues it.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:58:12
Like the Iraq war, we are too deep to pull out now. There are already multi-millioin dollar investments and big companies invested in Bitcoin for them to let government regulate it. China was succcessful because it holds a monopoly on power and it wasn't too widely used. In other parts of the world, like the US, it's already too widely known.

Now is a good time to buy. There seems to be fairly strong support at around $500's-range. I doubt we will go much lower than this. However, you should only buy a few at first just in case. Then slowly buy more if the price starts to rise to $590+. Just remember that anything can happen. 
I would start by purchasing one or two coins from a high-rated seller on localbitcoins.com. That way you will receive them instantly and you won't have to worry about verification.
Coinbase is a reliable option as well; especially if you want to purchase a larger volume. The only downside to purchasing with Coinbase is that you might have to wait three to five days to receive your coins. The verification is a bit of a PITA as well. I've purchased many coins with them and they're always on time. I'm happy.
Most importantly of all, make sure you know how to securely store your coins. I keep the majority of my coins in cold storage. The rest I keep in a hot wallet for purchases and for trading.

It's written in the Bitcoin code that there will only ever be 21 million coins ever created. In order for there to be more created, the vast majority of people using Bitcoin would have to agree to update their Bitcoin programs to a new version that allowed for more coins; but nobody in their right mind would do that since that would devalue what they already have.

EMPs are definitely real. However, as you said, it is an extreme fear. I wouldn't worry to much about it. If all of a sudden nukes start going off, my bitcoins would be the last of my concerns. Credit cards and cash are no different.
A pure EMP would not stop crypto-currency if it's already been widely adopted. I imagine that by then, there will have been a way to securely backup your coins in a very easy way. For example, services that backup your encrypted keys automatically to multiple locations around the world. The keys would be encrypted locally, and then the data would be sent out to trusted servers where they are again encrypted and backed up. Even the people running the servers wouldn't be able to look at the keys because it would all be encrypted data.
I don't really know what solutions there will be, but if Bitcoin reaches a high rate of adoption, there will no doubt be very ingenious solutions to protect from these different types of scenerios.

At the moment, he supposedly owns 7.8 % of the coins in existence. However, I doubt he will sell all of his coins.
For him to dump 1 million BTC he would have to give his identity away. If the coins start moving, people would notice and start tracking. He wouldn't do it all at once either; if he wanted to, he would have to sign up at a high-volume exchange, where they will no doubt ask for personal information. He cares too much about his privacy to do that.
It's more likely that if he ever starts to use them, it will be when they are widely accepted. He will use them as he needs them, in no extravagant way. It seems like he's more of a DPR type (Dread Pirate Roberts, guy from Silk Road). DPR had many bitcoins. He could've bought a huge house, but instead he sold only a few at a time to pay for things like rent and food. Mind that he also lived in a shared living arrangement, an apartment in San Francisco. If you start spending nilly-willy, you're going to draw attention to yourself.

It's a close-call between Mycelium and Blockchain.info wallets.
* **Mycelium** is great local wallet that allows for importing / exporting of private keys and cold storage options. It has a feature to find local buyers and sellers, an address book, ability to choose exchange rate source, and many other features. The only downside is that its GUI is a little ugly.
* **Blockchain.info** is a feature rich wallet as well. You have the ability to import / export private keys, lookup exchange rates, an address book, lock it with a pin. One feature I really like is that you can set watch-only addresses as well. The downside: it's actually connected to the blockchain.info site. So if that goes down, you'll have trouble spending. Although you can set it to function in P2P mode.
Edit: As noted by Mycelium is also server dependant. However, the good thing about Mycelium is that you can export your keys if the server goes down. According to the Mycelium app description, they have two servers. In case one goes down, the other one is available: "Client side load balancing between two 100% redundant server nodes located in different datacenters." Blockchain.info has an automatic wallet backup service as well. To summarize, there are downsides and upsides to using each one. I would recommend you try both wallets.

If I had to absolutely trust a third party, it would probably be Coinbase because they keep most of their coins in cold storage. However, I would never do that because I don't control the keys.
If you want a simple way, yet relatively secure, download the Electrum wallet ( Install it unto a clean computer. One that is not used for downloading pirated software, email attachments, and such. Then move your funds into it.
The really nice thing about Electrum is that it allows you to restore your wallet simply by using a series of words. That means that if you loose your computer, you can restore all your funds with just those words. So make sure you memorize them and write them down in a secure location.
Note: If you're going to store a lot of money using Bitcoin, then I highly recommend for you to learn about proper Bitcoin security.

If the coins are still being associated with your address and there are no transactions from or to that address, they should still be there. It seems that it's definitely a problem with the wallet, considering it's alpha (which means it's very buggy).

It's likely that the $/BTC price will not settle any time soon. If you look at the price after the March 2013 bubble, you will noticed it *stabalized* at the 100-130 range for a few months. That may happen again, but this time the range may be somewhere between the 500-800 range (Bitstamp). Then perhaps later in the year it may take off again.
As Andreas said in [his LA talk]( "there is no Bitcoin still at a thousand in two years." Bitcoin price is driven by the amount of users. If Bitcoin is still in this price range, then it has failed because there have not been any new users. In fact, Bitcoin cannot settle at current prices. It will either be worth much less, or a lot more than it is now.

Okay, here's what you need to know:
**Where to buy?**
* [Coinbase.com]( is the easiest and most trusted way to buy and sell your bitcoin in the USA. You will need to link your bank account to buy and sell.
* [Bitstamp.net]( is the most widely used exchange located in Europe.
* [Localbitcoins.com]( is an easy way to buy coins from other people located in your area. However, make sure you only buy from someone with a high-rating.
**How to store the coins?**
Never, under any circumstances, leave your coins where you don't control the private keys. That means don't leave them on Coinbase or on Bitstamp. Even though they are trusted sites, you still don't control the keys.
Get a good desktop wallet like [Electrum]( Write down the seed in a very secret place and don't ever show it to anyone. The seed will allow you to restore your wallet in case of a computer crash. Keep your seed in at least two-places that you trust. Perhaps one at home in a safe, and the other in a bank-vault or at a relative's house that you highly trust. Keep most of your funds stored on Electrum, and make sure Electrum is installed on a computer that is not used for surfing shady sites on the Internet or downloading pirated material.
You can also use a mobile wallet or online wallet like Blockchain.info for your everyday spending.
**More questions?**
Please ask me anything. I'd be more than happy to help you.
Happy bitcoining!

I don't think these people know what real money is, much less Bitcoin.

Mt. Gox is one of the oldest exchanges that is based in ~~Hong Kong~~ Tokyo, Japan. Unfortunately, last year the US government froze Mt.

I think you can still withdraw, but it takes a very long time (two months)?

Can you tell us what flights you were looking at? I doubt that there is a fee that high.
I went to test purchase a flight. A flight from LAX to SFO is $156.75. Cheapair says it's 0.14781525 bitcoins. Now Cheapair uses Coinbase. Coinbase buy price at the time of purchase was $1057.95. If we multiply the amount Cheapair asks by Coinbase's price (0.14781525*$1057.95) we get ~$156.38. We see that it's even less, but close enough to the price Cheapair asks in USD. I don't see a problem.
There is a miners fee,  but it's on Coinbase's part. That fee is for the transmission of funds for the miners and it's usually a few cents.
OP, can you please provide further evidence that the fee is that high?

LocalBitcoins has an escrow service where once you make a purchase, the seller's coins will be held until you mark the payment as complete.
When you make a deposit, you will be asked to include a reference number so that the seller can identify your deposit. Make sure you follow the seller's instructions.

Well stated. If the price does go down below $300/BTC, do you believe that it can ever recover? Perhaps everyone will see the cheap price and buy more coins, sending the price back up again.

Choose one of the following places to buy:

It's a tiny bit more expensive, but you can buy directly from people at  (global). I like using LocalBitcoins because I don't have to give up a whole bunch of information to an exchange and I can buy instantly using cash.

They are keeping most coins offline, and that is a great security practice. I would say that they are trust worthy. They know what they're doing and aren't running out of some basement. However, one of the points of Bitcoin is that you have complete control over your money. If for whatever reason they decide to withhold withdrawals, then you will be stuck without nothing when you need your bitcoins.
The question comes down to "do I trust them or myself the most?"

Dropbox does not encrypt your files. I  wouldn't trust Dropbox with my money like that. All it takes is a disgruntled employee to copy these files. Even though your wallet is password protected, don't rely just on that. If you insist on using an online storage as backup, at least look into SpiderOak; your files are automatically encrypted before they're uploaded to their servers and the application is also open source.
Edit: the best way to store is cold storage.

There definitely is a need for cheap money transmission. Bitcoin can easily fill this need, but not without companies that support it first. People recognize brands because that's what they've been tought.
The way I see it is that Bitcoin is similar to what Linux was in the beginning. Now Linux has become much more popular because there are companies that support it; e.g., companies like Google, Canonical, and IBM.
Bitcoin is going to be the future, but most people wont even know they're using it.

Oh, I understand now. Basically what is happening is you're using mixing up the selling price of various exchanges.
There is always a price difference between various exchanges. Remember that Cheap Air uses the Coinbase exchange to process their checkout. Coinbase rate at the moment or writing is $1064/BTC. Bitcoinity, by default displays Mt. Gox prices, which at the moment is $1162/BTC.
So the Cheap Air cost of 1.16325 bitcoins converted to USD using Coinbase is $1237.70. If you convert the total using Mt. Gox prices, which is what you were doing, you get $1351.70.
Moral of the story, understand that prices vary by various online exchanges.

With Electrum there is no need to download the blockchain. All you need to backup your wallet is the wallet.dat file. When you're ready to spend again, you reopen the wallet.dat file using Electrum.

We need a fast Bitcoin payment system first. Especially in a places like fast food restaurants where they need to process payments quickly. We also need a low cost integration with current point-of-sale systems.
All that will cost companies money, which will slow adoption. I think we are still far away from popular brick-and-mortar stores accepting it. First there will be a big online adoption. Places like Amazon. Then eventually physical stores.

Nobody knew, with a few strokes of the keyboard that attackattackattack would cause a drop in today's price. He started a rumor about a Subway accepting Bitcoin in LA. He didn't know that DannyDesert would drive to find out. DannyDesert didn't know that he would cause a vehicle behind him to stop at a red light, causing the driver of said vehicle to be late. Late to his bank, where he would make a $1 million wire transfer to an exchange, which he would then use to purchase coins, preventing today's drop in price.
If it wasn't for those few words that he typed just for *lulz*, we would all be a little richer.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is being used as an investing platform faster than it's being adopted in the real world by businesses. I just hope that when the investors do their pump and dumps, people don't lose too much or be discouraged.

Ten minutes is nothing. Pick a few persuasive points you want to talk about. For example:
* What is it?
* Compare to current systems
* What are the advantages?
* How easy are they to use? (Maybe even do a live demo by buying something online).
* Where to buy them.
Easy. Done.
Edit: make sure you simplify when explaining what it is. It's only a ten minute speech. You don't want to bore them to death. You may even be able to work in the 10 000. BTC pizza story in there. That's sure to grab their attention.

This idea came to me about two or three months ago as well. Bitcoin seems like a really good idea for farmers markets. What you need to do is 1) provide them with an easy solution, almost spoon-fed to them. 2) They need to see it first. Set up three sellers at the market who accept bitcoins. Show them how much more convenient and easy it is. People are more likely to believe when they see it with their eyes. 3) Have a way for people to convert cash for coins at the market so they have them to spend. You can even set up a stall to promote Bitcoin.

If you want to talk of ominous stories, I really like the one where the *global elite* are allowing Bitcoin only because they know it will become really popular and then eventually crash due to some technical error. That's when they will bring their own one-world global currency that is backed by governments.

These corporations work in a pyramid structure of power. You have workers on the bottom and the CEO at the top, what he says goes.
When you contact "support" via email or phone call, the low level workers are not going to give a shit, because to them it's just a job. You need to convince the people at the very top.
If you can convince someone with the authority to make changes, then you're in. Perhaps someone on good terms, a close friend or family member can accomplish this.
In business, it's all about connections.

The U.S. government usually sells all seized assets; and they consider the seized bitcoins an asset. They need to hold it as evidence, but once the trial is over and if they find him guilty, they will sell them off. When that happens, there will be a big drop in the price.

2FA is a good start. Buying from Coinbase is safe.
Now If you're going to purchase a large amount, I'd advise against storing them in web wallets like Blockchain.info or even Coinbase because if they are ever hacked, your coins can be stolen.
Download a desktop client where you will keep the keys to your coins offline, instead of trusting a website.
 is a good beginners wallet.
The consensus is to keep a desktop wallet on a computer not connected to the Internet. But most agree that it's best practice to keep your coins stored on a paper wallet.

If you do buy in, just remember that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. The risks are high, but so are the rewards.

No no no, you can't tell people directly why they should move. That's not the way the minds of the people work. You need to make them think they need it. Make them feel they need it.
The fastest way for people to migrate their wealth to Bitcoin is if they *believe* in it or are *scared* enough; similar to what happened in Cyprus.
First explain the dangers of government currencies. Then briefly mention alternatives to fiat, say that Bitcoin is a very good alternative. Once the idea is planted, just wait for them to ask more questions. It works.

Anyway, imagine a dollar was the smallest possible unit. We decide to divide the dollar by 100. If you previously had dollars, they are not going to be worth less. They're going to be worth the same, except now you can divide them by 100.
It's the same idea with Satoshis. Bitcoin can't be inflated, just subdivided.
Inflation is when an entity creates more of the money you hold therefore decreasing your purchasing power.

Yes, everything needs love. It's very important. However, in the scientific view of the world we try to explain and understand. If we don't have evidence we can test, we can't know if it's real or not. While a particular experience may seem real to an individual, it can't be tested, therefore can't be accepted as empirical evidence.

Don't try to convince them. Just do it. Next time you go to a shopping center there should be a bank near by. You can use it to buy bitcoins from someone on localbitcoins.com. Look for someone looking to sell using cash deposit. Also make sure they have a high rating.
