Is not exactly what I have in mind, it should ask the user on the first run what size would he prefer to allocate for the chain. A regular user doesn't know exactly what pruning does or how to access this option. 
Also, I don't suggest pruning, but the possibility to have a big number of core users that store random parts of the blockchain so when you have 100k nodes always online you will be sure you will get to download the block you need. Most of these users will only store 2-5 GB of blocks, some will have 40-80GB and few of them will store the full database regardless of size. As a user you only select the size limit, you don't know what blocks you get to store, so we get decentralization without huge effort from ALL the participants. 
Again, this might be impossible technically, but is the vision I have about the future, and imagine countless bitcoin ATMs that offer to store 64GB of random blocks, then you won't have to worry about how big the blockchain will get or how expensive is the storage medium: someone, somewhere will have the block you need to download in order to verify the source of a transaction.

But, what is money? What exactly are you sending through email? You think you actually transfer money? Then why weren't greeks able to transfer money from their OWN accounts in the last year bank blockade? 
I quote from 20 July 2015 : "Banks in cash-strapped Greece opened Monday for the first time in three weeks.  Bank customers will be allowed to make a single withdrawal of 420 euro ($455) a week, instead of just 60 euro ($65) in daily withdrawals.  However, restrictions on cash transfers abroad will remain in place."
And this was also a problem in Cyprus and is a problem right now in Venezuela, Argentina and other countries. You think you are so safe with your precious bank account? When you feel like it, go read 
There is no other alternative to send value over internet than bitcoin. Nobody can stop your transaction and is not reversible. You think that your bank ability to stop payments is good, but we think it is a flaw. At one point in your life you will be affected by it and maybe then you will think about "what if there were a way to bypass this stupid bank system?"

You are looking for @_date: 2016-08-01 13:41:13
A smart way to allocate available space dedicated to store the blockchain. 
Do you wish to store only 1GB of blocks? Here you are downloading only the most recent blocks and automatically deleting the old ones that doesn't contain transactions relevant to your own private keys. 
Do you wish to store 82.64 GB of blocks? Here you are, you will store almost the whole chain, without a random number of blocks that is not relevant to you.
Do you wish to prevent core to eat all your precious SSD space in the future? Set up a limit above which the size of the chain will never go above.
I expect to see this kind of upgrade to the core in the future so we will have more nodes that are 'almost full' nodes, but with a random number of blocks missing to suit everybody needs.
Even better: do you have a capped internet connection? Set core to never step over the limit you set (a daily or monthly limit maybe).
I think this will make core better, but I have no idea if this is technically possible.

1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.  
They were asked "What's your Internet strategy?" And their collective response was along the lines of ... "Our what?"
It's 2016. The question now is ... "What's your Bitcoin strategy?" (c) Stephen Gornick

For example, steam has 1 mil users in USA (I don't know the actual number), 10% of the old users will move over to VPN to make cheap purchases. At the same time, there are potentially 500k *new* users that will make an account trough VPN just because *now* they can.

Let's say I run a full node, but in settings I could let the program to use up to 66.6 GB of hdd space and nothing more.

The first transaction was 5.219 sat/B, the second one 2.632 sat/B.
This is because when you send a small amount, you sent it from one address, but the bigger one used more addresses, so the transaction had more weight, 6080 vs 1628.
Just be patient, it will go trough eventually.

My brain will remain puzzled for long time: you give here links to pando, mashable, bussinerinsider, that's nice. 
BUT there is no article and no mention of bitcoin on the front page during the very day of the experiment. 
Moreover, the search for 'bitcoin' returns no results at all, even if there is an article in your site:
 (April 11, 2013 - that's ancient history now).
And, if you paid once 5$ and decide to pay more, the pop-up is nowhere to be found again. (not to mention that the Confirm button doesn't work for many).

Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c)  @_date: 2014-02-18 02:17:01

Bitcoin100 exists specifically to convince new charities to start accepting bitcoin donations. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts of various backgrounds from around the world have supported this project with time, effort and/or bitcoins. In order to use donated funds in a manner consistent with donor expectations, Bitcoin100 donates the Bitcoin equivalent of $1000 to non-political, secular charities that prominently display an option for supporters to contribute via Bitcoin on their website.

Edit: confirm button doesn't work for me either. If you click on "No**,** Thanks" (there is a comma missing - who wants 'No Thanks' at all?) - you cannot find the paywall again anywhere afterwards. So I had to open a different browser to pay again (if I so desire)...

The "bitcoin aha moment" is a thing we should be able to make easy.
Here is my attempt:
1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.  
They were asked "What's your Internet strategy?" And their collective response was along the lines of ... "Our what?"
It's 2015. The question now is ... "What's your Bitcoin strategy?" (c) Stephen Gornick

Just about everything that we buy goes up in price with time. For example, an item that costs $100 today would cost $134.39 in ten years given a three percent inflation rate. In 15 years, the same item would cost $155.80, or over 50 percent more than today.
Another way to understand the impact of inflation is to determine the value of today's dollar in the future. For instance, $100 that you have today, in 15 years given a three percent inflation rate, would be worth only $64.19. Inflation over time does erode the value of money.
 Suppose that you needed $60,000 for your first year of retirement. How much money would you need in 20 years to maintain the same purchasing power as today? Assume the annual inflation rate averages 3%.
The first result (Reduced Amount) is $33,220.55, which represents the value of $60,000 in 20 years. The second result (Required Amount) is $108,366.67, which is amount of money that you need in 20 years to match the purchasing power of $60,000.
TL;DR: 3% inflation per year = your savings will have 50% less purchase power in 15 years.

Thank you! Now, if vote manipulators will delay their actions by 5 minutes (or 10 minutes), it will blend with organic votes so this kind of analysis will be harder/useless in the future.
I think vote manipulators have an economic incentive and they will try whatever tactic to get to their goals, so you should ask reddit developers for a personalized solution (that hopefully will not be bashed as 'censorship').

Resources - Bitcoin Core - FAQ
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:52:09
1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.  
They were asked "What's your Internet strategy?" And their collective response was along the lines of ... "Our what?"
It's 2016. The question now is ... "What's your Bitcoin strategy?" (c) Stephen Gornick

1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Almost instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, very low fees, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.

You run a service that receive many small payments, many of which have small or no fees. 
You can consolidate and 'force' confirmation by making a new transaction that has enough fees for all the pending payments (that otherwise would be stuck forever in the queue due low fees).

It takes only moments to start the program from SSD compared to minutes on HDD. If I ever need to resync the chain, it is horribly slowed down by the HDD access time. 
And, of course, everything else is faster when you use a SSD.

1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, very cheap and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Almost instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.  
They were asked "What's your Internet strategy?" And their collective response was along the lines of ... "Our what?"
 It's 2017. The question now is ... "What's your Bitcoin strategy?" (c) Stephen Gornick

I run two full nodes on machines with Win XP and 2 GB RAM. My problem is not the bandwidth, but the regular crashes of bitcoin-qt.exe, faulting module msvcrt.dll. Daily I must check is the nodes are still up. 
Also, if there is a power failure, the blockchain gets corrupted and the reindexing is not working. So I have the option  to download the chain again, or to copy it from the other machine (way faster).
My point is: make the damn program better, fix the bugs, make it power failure tolerant, maybe even "office computer friendly" so it would run at full capacity during idle times and run in safe mode when users are actually trying to do some work on their stations.

In a distant future when I expect states to be weaker, how will be the scientific barriers pushed further? Not that nowadays we are thriving on science sponsored by goverments, and maybe you can say we should divert the money spent on military to this purpose - but military maybe will always be needed (more or less) and Neil has a valid point here. I hope you understand my question: Bitcoin grow -&gt; banks falls -&gt; governments cannot 'loan' money anymore neither for war or scientific projects -&gt; idiocracy.

Google "bitcoin mining farm" to understand the level of competition you are facing. 
The process of mining is done in order to prove that energy was spent in order to be able to create a block of transfers. The 12.5 bitcoins + some extra fees are a bonus to this task.

A typical product might use the numbers 0.9 (for beta software)...
Some systems use numerical versions less than 1 (such as 0.9), to suggest their approach toward a final "1.0" release. This is a common convention in open source software.

Based on Chromium, Epic is the perfect example of a browser that strips out every conceivable feature to maximise privacy. It’s rather like using a minimalist Google Chrome with the Google. Cookies and trackers are eliminated after each session, all searches  are proxied through the firm’s own servers (which means there is no way to connect an IP address to a search), and it attempt to  prioritise SSL connections wherever possible., useful for open Wi-Fi connections. It does not collect data about its users and comes with excellent built-in ad blocking.
For a fully-encrypted connection, it includes a one-button proxying feature that does slow down browsing but will appeal to some users (it can’t necessarily be used as a regional bypass proxy because Epic’s servers are based in the US).

See if any of these get to you:
1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.  
They were asked "What's your Internet strategy?" And their collective response was along the lines of ... "Our what?"
It's 2015. The question now is ... "What's your Bitcoin strategy?" (c) Stephen Gornick

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 100 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 22,600 satoshis (0.12$).
For 50 sat/byte you can still expect to see your transaction in a block any moment now.

Someone  should write an ELI15 step by step full node install instructions for this:
 
Add a usb to sata cable for ~$5 : 
And a sata hdd for ~$25: 
Or a sata ssd for ~35: 
Then anyone could build a $60 full node computer, maybe give it as a gift to other interested friends.
You want the number of full nodes to increase? Then step on it!
Use new hdds and make it a business, sell the $99 full bitcoin node to whole world! For bitcoins!

2. Move extra coins that are in the genesis block (not the initial 50, but the donations that were made afterward).

Is just the way bitcoin works. A plan is running right now to increase capacity while maintaining the decentralized nature of Bitcoin: 
However, even with these steps, there is no way (that I can see) that 'everybody' has their transactions recorded in the blockchain. Maybe in a few years the storage cost will drop and the internet speed will increase a lot, or new layers on top of the blockchain will get the heavy traffic and settle periodically. Until then, this is how it works:

1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.

Vic Hedges on Oct 28, 9:56 AM said:
Use of large amounts of paper cash is a marker for criminal activity and going ~100% electronic will inhibit these criminal transactions. Naturally crime will never be completely wiped out but can be greatly reduced especially if the USD went paperless. Enormous cost efficiencies will also follow as there is no need to print, stack, store, and secure large stacks of virus and bacteria tainted paper slips.
This is very positive.

And now a woman has real chances to become president. 
Well, the future changes will look so natural to future you, as it looks natural to have a black lesbian atheist as president in USA.

The AFIP 22,000 fines applied merchants to accept payment cards
02/02/2015 The AFIP, Ricardo Echegaray, criticized entrepreneurs looking to "profits without paying taxes" in rejecting the electronic payment and called "help" to consumers to monitor irregularities
The Federal Administrator of Public Revenues (AFIP), Ricardo Echegaray, again criticized Monday to merchants who do not accept card payments, to qualify such conduct as "unwise" and called "help" to taxpayers in order to combat irregularities.
"Instead of taking advantage healthily successful summer season, have you worried more than anything in search tools to make a profit without paying taxes," whipped.
To spread the tax revenue in January, which showed an increase of 30.1 percent over the same month in 2014, the official reiterated his refusal to businesses that refuse to accept cards, noting that 22,000 were carved infraction "lack of reception" of electronic payment, which he considered "a significant number".
During a brief press conference held together with Finance Minister Juan Carlos Pezoa, said also that 35,500 inspections were conducted by the "unwise" behavior.
Therefore, asked consumers to report any irregularities when they perceive that "everyone pays taxes."
"We support a strong each and every consumer. We have encountered situations imbalance, especially in shopping sandboxes, ATVs," emphasized Echegaray was quoted by DyN.
In this regard, he insisted that no taxpayers "who pay their taxes and have to look like others, with a tax stature is different".
The administrator also remarked: "We want the employer to do well, you win much, but to pay their taxes."
On the other hand, said the HSBC bank began operations because "the teaser rose", while warning that the Government continue research, which sought to "resort to Switzerland to obtain information."

The problem with time travel (that nobody mentioned to you yet) is that when you travel back in time, you also HAVE to travel back in space.   You have to consider Earth rotation, it's movement around the sun, the sun movement in space, the galaxy movement too and the expansion of the universe. 
So far each time travel attempt failed because they ended in empty space, you need a spaceship with a temporal drive. 
I will let you know when we figure it out, don't worry.

Is not about being less secure, is about the fact that if you spend even one Satoshi, you actually spend all the amount on that address and then the CHANGE does not return to the same address written on the coin. 
Many bitcoins were lost due lack of understanding of how the transfer is done. When you decide to open a coin, import the private key to a wallet (like Bitcoin-QT) and then spend the needed amount.  The physical coin after this point, has lost it's cold wallet function.

1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-source digital currency and payment system that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, irreversible cash-like transfers of value, working on the largest, most powerful and also the most secure decentralized computing network on the planet. The first currency and money system in the history of mankind which has no counter-party risk to hold and to transfer. (c) Capt_Roger_Murdock
2) Almost instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, very low fees, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and-mortar merchants were asked how they would respond to Amazon.

Technically, the shuttle cannot reach the moon. 
Try with a Saturn V rocket instead. Or Ares V.

Bitcoin mantra:
1) Bitcoin is a fixed supply, a first-of-its-kind, global-in-scale, voluntary, decentralized open-
source digital currency and payment network that enables direct, peer-to-peer, borderless, pseudo-
anonymous, nearly-instantaneous, nearly-free and irreversible cash-like transfers of value.  The 
first currency and money system in the world which has no counter-party risk to hold and to 
transfer. (c) Roger_Murdock
2) Instant transactions, no waiting for checks to clear, no chargebacks (merchants will like this), 
no account freezes (look out Paypal), no international wire transfer fee, almost no fees of any 
kind, no minimum balance, no maximum balance, worldwide access, always open, no waiting for 
business hours to make transactions, no waiting for an account to be approved before transacting, 
open an account in a few seconds, as easy as email, no bank account needed, extremely poor people 
can use it, extremely wealthy people can use it, no printing press, no hyper-inflation, no debt 
limit votes, no bank bailouts, completely voluntary. This sounds like the best payment system in 
the world! (c) Trace Mayer, J.D.
3) Back in 1994 when Amazon was just getting started the bricks-and -mortar merchants were asked 
how they would respond to Amazon.  
They were asked "What's your Internet strategy?"
And their collective response was along the lines of ... "Our what?"
It's 2013. The question now is ... "What's your Bitcoin strategy?"
