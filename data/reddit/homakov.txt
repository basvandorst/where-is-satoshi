You pessimistically lock the user who sells and the user who buys, so all other users are unlocked meanwhile. Many engines can run at once securely

Alright. Hub has 10k btc. What about sybil attack, how the hub knows who to open channel to? It would be very manual, because hub must risk onchain fees ($20-50) of its own money for something that could be just a single off chain transfer (with low commission like $0.01). 
And before I pay to Bob I would go to hub 2 hours earlier and say "please open channel to Bob". 
If the hub opens channels only to trusted users (ie vendors) then it will support only limited use cases.


LN is not a startup: it's a tech extension and the only true scaling plan around. I'd like it to see some growth strategy behind it.

@_date: 2018-06-04 12:30:49
You said it yourself, that nodes that are grossing and receive a lot of funds right now would be in trouble. Channel is exhausted = you can't receive money. You can send them sure *but you don't want to*. Payments are not zero sum, they are super random. 
Nobody can predict who to who and how much are going to pay. Which means no one can predict which merchant would need more inward capacity preloaded. 
Having a credit line you simply promise instead of putting up a capacity first. Both merchant and the hub are fine with it too. Any merchant would prefer less secure money over no money at all.

Point being: don't limit yourself to coffee transactions. This market is very small. The more types of tx it can support the better. Ideally all sizes even 4M but a middle ground with up to 10k eur sounds good too.
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:55:06


There is. And then there is common sense too. If doing blockchain-alike architecture (tech that just happen to not have obvious "transition" part) is so easy, then we should stop bragging around that miners/validators are not money transmitters. 
Common sense wise they are, which means FinCEN-wise they soon will be.

That "definition" was written before blockchains and will be adjusted accordingly. Very soon. 
Otherwise i can make up million more ways to avoid regulations with whatever DAG or lattice chain is fashionable now. And any fin company would use it because why bother with regulations.

No one can define what LN is supposed to be just as no one can define BTC. Routable payment network with risk &gt; non-routable one w/o risk.
In the post I described receivability: go and try to pay random 1k LN nodes $1 and see that 99% of payments will fail. That's what the OP experienced too.
If you have a better way to describe "receivability" please tell.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:04:06
If you find a way to somehow, magically, splice and have capacity always ready you can always downgrade and set credit lines to 0. But i am 100% it is not possible. There's neither enough collateral nor incentive to allocate it for anonymous nodes.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:09:20
Everything that confirms money transmission is textbook money transmission.
Back to paypal example: 4 miners run by paypal: no license? If not, 1 miner by paypal and 3 "other" entities, then? Right now the law is abused left and right, and easy to twist under any apple pay/bank model to avoid any regulation. Which means, it won't be long like that. Is USDT a cryptocurrency btw?
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:28:15


Just bitcoin mining? What about bitcoin cash? Or ethereum? Or USD tokens on top of ethereum? Or my version of ethereum that works like paypal and you can only be light client?
FinCEN missed that when most guys are light clients then majority of validating nodes *are* transmitters because they together define the consensus and what merkle proofs they return to users. They basically receive value and decide what to do with it, unlike the scenario where everyone is a full node.
So, while Bitcoin Core might be exempt, chains like BCH-like paypal would not be as there would be just few full nodes who would decide the consensus and be basically custodians and transmitters.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:08:57
Not a version of LN. LN extended with credit lines, which you can keep at zero. Just another optional feature.
Working on this capacity for a year, I am quite sure no "dynamics" can solve it entirely. Having a mainnet version out there makes it even easier to proof. 
I mean, feel free to wait for a year or two and see that LN is stuck in capacity and 99% of payments are non-receivable. 
Blockchains can't scale to world transfers without a tradeoff somewhere, and LN doesn't make any risk/credit tradeoff so it probably just can't work. Would be too easy.

And then you're gonna have hard time figuring out how centralized it is. We can set 21 independent validators who would happily pretend to be independent (hello EOS). Or 100 of them. **Not even crypto community has clear understanding of what is centralized**, I don't expect FinCEN to know it any better. 
Paypal is established and knows that pulling we-are-blockchain trick will not work long term for them, but say yet another Liberty Reserve clone does just that, FinCEN will have to update this ruling from scratch. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:19:06
Say if "drugs" were defined as something having specific molecules instead of "being substances that mess with your mind and are risky for your life". That's what it is now, a definition that intends to mean one thing but has not anticipated more broader bypasses.
More than that, give me lawyers who know tech + some interest from FinCEN to change it, and I will easily bend blockchains to transmitters definition. Lawyers, they can do things. Especially given this tech is so new and can be understood differently by looking from different angles.

Demonstrate it, with scenarios "if this then that". What can happen to latest state users that can't to genesis state?
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:11:36
Yep, old blockchain is pretty much useless. You can wipe out first 8 years and you lose nothing. The article explains why: you are already relying on page to provide correct source code, the same way you rely they provide correct state (be it genesis or latest one). 
And the latest one saves time for sync. And if everyone uses latest ones, no one needs the old blocks anymore. You only need to keep a tail like 6-12 months of blocks to let people who were offline for that long to sync back. Everyone else must hop on the latest state when they bootstrap a new node.
It's all about **the way software is distributed** makes it useless to trust the software you get but not trust the state it has inside and verify it. 
1) You can trust both code and latest state. 
2) You can verify both (with snapshot hashes). - highly recommended
3) But there is no need to trust code but not trust the state it will run from - it's just a waste of time **security model wise**

No. Chicken and egg problem. None of your current software can download something from the Internet in "trustless decentralized way". Funnily, I'm sure blockchain app (after trusting it on first install) can solve this too and create some kind of multisig for software authenticity. I have some ideas, but long way to go, first we need to solve payments.

Because otherwise i don't see why would you talk about trusted vm
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:03:09


Can you point to some kind of terminology page? My understanding "full node" is short for "fully verifying node". It doesn't have to be "archiving mode" that provides blocks for everyone else. You don't need to store old blocks for your own security, you do it because you want to help.

@_date: 2018-02-24 09:40:16
A cloud node doesn't count as a real node. If all nodes were in the cloud it would be too easy to mess with them by centralized providers.
 A full node in physical possession is important.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:39:01
How do you know your vps isn't just reselling some big cloud provider? Most smaller vps host under bigger companies anyway.
Your physical node can be modified by you and your computer software. Cloud node is the same + everyone who has access to that cloud legally or not. You get bigger attack surface for nothing, that's why choosing personal node in your laptop is no brainer. 
Obviously, that would require "geniuses" behind Core to figure out snapshotting for fast bootstrapping and staying in sync, but that's doable.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:20:35

I run full node btc core on my mac, got it installed via snapshot in 15 min. Daily sync takes about 2 min. Zero hassle.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:33:52
It does, there would be a counterparty risk (which is optionally set by you, you still can set creditline=0)
But what would you chose, a functioning model with manageable risk or non-functioning model w/o any trade-off? I've made a proposal here 
No one so far offered a real liquidity solution with sensible incentive model. I did, it's not pretty and involves some trust though. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:26:09
Users can open channels to whoever they want, problems start when they need to route payments.
There is no incentive for a hub to open a channel to new peers without being reimbursed for this first. Alice cannot make hub open channel to Bob, because Bob might be a fake user.
Also, in this model each hub risks a ton of their money. That's a hell of a hot wallet in the cloud, and the fees below 1% will never cover it.
Has anyone committed to running a hub under offered ln model? None. Nobody is interested in that. Today, in 6 months, in a year, you will see. Then you guys will figure out credit lines are the only way, move on to  but it will be too late.
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:52:16

1) How reliable is the channel states? I claim that i have more channels than i do
2) This way, only already well connected nodes can "mate" with each other. Outsiders are not welcome. Someone with 0 bitcoins can't onboard.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:56:36
Beads are good for explaining things and visual demos. For network stats thickness sounds better. There should be an option to see capacity from A to B somehow.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:59:15
Yes I know. For demo purposes you can see all channels state, but in real stats you don't have this data.
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:29:12
Offchain security model is not exactly the same, I made a comparison here

My thoughts exactly! I proposed beads visualization 
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:05:55
Yep this is how it works. Yep capacity problem is very real. I have a solution at failsafe.network
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:35:41
It's too early for any calculations, the scheme fails much earlier: why open a channel?
You are a hub and I want to pay through you to someone. How exactly can I make you to open a channel for $1000 to that someone? 
Hub must pay few dollars for onchain tx + spend $1000 of liquidity, *hoping* to be reimbursed later and hoping this channel will be heavily used. In anonymous Byzantine setting of bitcoin, the hub would be abused very quickly. 
Google around, everyone at some point asks "i have outward capacity, but how do i get inward capacity?" and that's when LN mumbles something about fees but never explains the process step by step.
"put up collateral first" could work if you knew exactly all money movements beforehand, KYCed everyone, so no deposit would be wasted and every charged channel would be used w/o useless collateral lock up. However, you can never know that, that's why "promise first, collateralize later" is the one that can work in reality. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:03:20
I'm not talking about protocol specifics or commands (payment channels on top of btc vm is a PITA), i'm talking generally: to get an inward capacity you need to motivate a hub to invest in a channel towards you. 
The fees are supposed to motivate the hub to charge your channel, but, how does the hub know **for sure** you are going to bring any fees (you will be paid/pay few hundred times) until you do?
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:05:39
That code has absolutely nothing to do with scripts. It's about encoding of URLs.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:02:44
Extend channel capacity beyond collateral, e.g. you open credit line to hub for $1k and hub doesn't have to put up collateral beforehand. Promise first, collateralize later = liquidity problem solved. I built a project around that idea 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:19:51
What you're talking about is streaming in chunks? Streaming is conditional - if the receiving party frees up capacity again by sending or circular rebalancing you mentioned (btw  for some reason calls such obvious approach "REVIVE").
If there's no circular route to you, then it can't work. Did you run a simulation to see how often it's possible? I think it's worth doing asap.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:27:22
That sentence might be inappropriate, can you tell me why?
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:50:54
In payment channels biggest culprit is capacity. It's not hard to send a million of 1/1000 satoshi payments, but there's nothing to be proud of as in the end of the day you sent 0.10 cents. 
LN needs to solve liquidity in order to route payments $10+. The bigger the payment you want to send the worse liquidity issue.
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:13:41
None of what your explained is gonna work or incentivized. Some made up scenario. I can bet on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:27:39
Actually, if there's no capacity from A to E, then no kind of offchain rebalance/triangle can change that. If it can, then there's already capacity. I.e. "just have a triangle" can't work. Demo:
a =====| b
b =====| c
c |===== e
d =====| e
here routability depends on channel between c and d.
if it's c=====|d the payment can be routed straight a-b-c-d-e without triangle rebalance e-c-d-e. If it's c|=====d, the payment can't be routed at all. 
In other words, circular rebalances do not impact routability. Either there was routable path in the first place, or there was none.
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:37:57

I'm not sure it's possible to be 100% sure about somebody else's channel. Also, it can be channels to my own sybils. Also, it's disaster for privacy to send all my channel states to randos.
Ok then it's getting a long thread, life is the best simulation: let's see how ln will get any meaningful route-ability this year.

The fees are too small. Required collateral is too large. Imagine Visa had to physically send $10k in cash to every shop BEFORE they received the money? Nonsense, right? That's why all transmitters first promise then settle.
