"If miners do what they say they will" ... Faaaaccck you..... How about the developers? Everyone wants to blame the miners. How about we take our 100k+ mines and just stop moving the block chain.

"If miners do what they say they will" If you want to just keep deflecting whatever.
Lets see "if everyone does what they say they will" with the hardfork

Without miners there are no users, without users there are no miners. Its duality here. You want SegWit fine. Give us a larger block size.  "Satoshi" commited the block size later in original development noting that "the block size can be increased later" it was more than likely meant to combat spam on the mempool/blockchain. BUT HEY I DONT KNOW ABOUT CRYPTO.

You sass mouth miners, and then when i try to defend my poition all you can talk about is a single sentence in caps, and the fact that i typed a word that looks like a "swear word". Your biggest defense against my comment is that im a "crazy newbie" or that i will start a "tangent". Stop trying to place blame on a single subset of users when it is all of our problem.  Obviously your simple mind is refusing to wrap around difficult problems. You dont understand how the blockchain moves, and what its going to take to keep it moving.  You also donct want to talk about the social problems within our circle. All you want to do is further austrisize a memeber of a diffeeent faction. Which is fine, But just solidifies how simple you are.

No i have none of that. Just a fat wallet, and a warehouse full of antminers. Good day.
