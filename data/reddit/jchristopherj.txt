Its the evil Chinese!!!! /s
I would argue almost all of the 75% that is not signalling Segwit actually want Segwit, but are using it as a leverage tool to get Core to increase the blocksize, even if it is just a tiny bit. Segwit + 2MB blocksize would get consensus so fucking fast your head would spin. 
But Core knows best; they are experts. Bend the knee. Everyone who wants a larger blocksize is an attacker and wants centralization.

How do I buy this
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:25:11
(((increase it as needed)))
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:50:28
Yes, let's just give away bitcoin's +1 competitive advantage: its hashpower. That's way less contentious than increasing the max blocksize by 1MB. Smart!
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:08:38
How is it not secure? I've used electrum since forever, and I have never had a single satoshi stolen. Every transaction I have ever made has gone through just fine.
Just keep your keys secure and you are good. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:19:56
true, but most noobz dont even see the number, they just download whatever the website they use gives them.
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:58:17
I understand that Bitcoin has many other advantages. However, I refuse to believe that a PoW change hard fork is less contentious than a 1MB increase hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:24:06
Oh no shit? TIL. 
Either way it appears that BIP 148 does not have "overwhelming consensus" since it is too contentious for core to merge in. Maybe I'm wrong though.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:25:40
Over 98% of miners putting "NYA" in their blocks. Pretty crazy.
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:36:35
At the end of the day, if 80% of the hash rate wants a hard fork, it is going to get it. The only way to survive a "80% attack" is to do a POW change, and that is probably one of the stupidest ideas I've seen being put forth currently.
For a soft fork, you need over 50%. Miners can orphan blocks that adhere to new softfork rules (for example orphaning blocks with a segwit transaction inside), but if its less than 50% then they lose. 
This is essentially what governs bitcoin, and I think it is perfect. Bitcoin has been working just as it should. 
"Democracy" is messy af, but worth it.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:03:17
Why hasn't it been merged into core yet? Oh ya it's because it doesn't have overwhelming consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:14:23
If BIP 148 has "overwhelming consensus" why doesn't Luke jr and one meg Greg merge it into core? 
I don't like the hypocrisy of this subreddit deleting xt, classic, and bu submissions for not having "overwhelming consensus", but at the same time allowing allowing this bitcoinuasf.org stuff.
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:19:18
I've seen you make this post a lot, down to the exact "Take your power back :) !"
If you look at the fifth rule in the sidebar, you will see:


Considering BIP 148 has less than 1% of the hashrate, I think it is safe to say that it does not have overwhelming consensus, and that your relentless BIP 148 promotion goes against this subreddit's rules.

In a UASF "economic nodes" are the only nodes that matter. So with a UASF, the users are forced to follow the "industrial oligopoly" with 0 say in the matter. At least I have some voice with mining, and right now 80+% of the hashpower is supporting this agreement.
This tweet can be tweeted any time a consensus is found without Core via mining. Core does not have veto power over bitcoin; no one controls the honey badger.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:54:20
That would require 51% of the hash rate attacking the network. In practice, if that ever happened, everyone would shit their pants and you would hear about it and take proper precautions.
For an average user like me, who only really gets payments sent to me from Coinbase, I never really have to fear about getting fake payments from some anon person who has 51% hash rate. I do not have even close to enough money to make that attack lucrative.
If I send a transaction on a partitioned network, then worst comes to worst I send coins on a phony chain. So what?
If you are a business then yes it makes sense to run a full node. And that is exactly what the white paper says:
"While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. **Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.**"

Miners are nodes. This is a fact that is everyone seems to be forgetting. Non mining nodes are not more important than mining nodes. To the contrary.
It doesn't matter what people are claiming the "economic majority" wants, if 80% of miners don't agree with the "economic majority" chain, then they can just fuck that “economic majority” chain up. They could mine a string of empty blocks, and only release it to the network after a bunch of normal blocks with economic transactions have been mined. Doing so would completely delete all of those economic transactions (transactions that are probably very important, and have super high fees, since the block time would be so long on that chain with only 20% hash rate).
You can argue that if the economic majority has 20% hash rate, then the 80% hash rate will have to switch over to make money, otherwise they are just losing money by attacking. But the miners have the moral high ground, they are the ones that have been investing and putting in the resources every second to constantly secure the network, so they should have more of a say than some fags on reddit who don’t contribute shit to the network. And if they amongst themselves have a 80% super majority banding together, they are unstoppable. Which is the way it should be. 
This system is actually very conservative, as a 25% hash rate can veto any hard fork. The only way a UASF would work is if like literally every single “economic node” was on the same page, and together they waited out the “80% attack”. This scenario is impossible imo, or would require dire circumstances (a blocksize increase is not one of them).

It is not a meritocracy either.
Bitcoin is essentially a democracy with no voter registration. You can vote as many times as you want as fast as you want (however fast your computer lets you).
"[Nodes] vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism." -the last sentence of the white paper

"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate." -Satoshi

How exactly would that happen with Electrum?

Because Blockstream was co founded by the holy trinity: One meg greg, Luke jr, and Adam Back. 
Bitcoin must never be taken from their corporation's control, otherwise Bitcoin is inevitably doomed. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:26:45


Where in the whitepaper does it discuss that?
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:43:26
Yeah can't you just reverse that argument:
"Segwit2X doesn't cause a chain split, the miners not running it do."
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:28:43
Probably a combination of Luke's UASF and Jihan's UAHF
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:47:04
All miners should yes. There is no point in running a non mining full node unless you are a business.
"It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in."
"As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network."
"Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification."

Lol he didn't, what I added is in brackets. Everything else is the first  sentence of the whitepaper.

"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments [of more than $1,000] to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. [For smaller purchases, one must simply pay a one-time-but-high transaction fee in order to get into a payment channel. Once there they can then get free transactions.]" -Satoshi
