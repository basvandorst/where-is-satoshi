You did not lose your coins forever, they will just take a very long time to confirm and the transaction might be dropped. The fee you paid is very low.
Blockchain.info doesn't provide good information on fees, it shows the total fee but not the fee/size which is more relevant. 
A Bitcoin transactions size is measured in the amount of data space it takes, not how many Bitcoins are sent. As your transaction has a lot of inputs, it's somewhat large. The fee you paid, 0.0001 BTC, is considered low even for a normal sized transaction (e.g. 1-3 inputs with two outputs).
The fee/size for your transaction is ~1 satoshi per byte, which is VERY low. You can use this site to estimate how long transactions with different fee/size take to confirm. Though with low fees it's not that accurate. 
Please use a better block explorer to look at your transactions that shows you the fee size, e.g.

Sorry for the late answer...
Yes, some ads will require you to be ID verified before you can open a trade. Other sellers ask you for your ID before giving you the payment details.
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:07:37
It's very hard to guess how long it'll take for it to confirm, I can't give you an educated guess.
When it's dropped by nodes you will no longer be able to find the transaction on blockchain explorers, then you can try sending it again.
I would recommend against using the core wallet, it's not really meant for regular users. Instead use Electrum or some other recommended wallet.

For some reason it's a common misconception on reddit that LocalBitcoins is primarily face to face trades. 
The site was originally built for face-to-face transactions, but it very quickly became apparent that online trades would be the big thing. 
It takes so much more time to meet up for a face to face trade that in order for it to be profitable for a seller either the fee has to be high or the amount very large. With Online trades the rates can be lower (for payment methods that have a low risk for fraud).

Unfortunately not, you'll have to make one non-segwit deposit to get a new address.

If I remember correctly the fees started dropping right around then from the late December high. When the fee level is dropping we generally tend to overspend on fees. This effect goes away once the fee level stabilizes again. This doesn't affect what you pay overly much since we batch outgoing transactions together.

Thank you for the links!

This was a problem that was recently introduced after a server upgrade. Thanks you for the report, our developers have since fixed the problem.
@_date: 2016-04-11 07:32:43
Ahh okay, in that case the problem is not with us since the transaction has 28 confirmations – It's been successfully sent.
The problem is with the receiver, with 28 confirmations it will show up on their end.
@_date: 2016-04-11 07:25:05
Best thing to do in this situation is to open up a support ticket, we can then look in to your transaction and help you.
Did you send the transaction TO your LocalBitcoins wallet or FROM your LocalBitcoins wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:08:57
AFAIK we should not be sending transactions with fees that are overly high during normal situations. Do you have any examples TXid's of this happening?
@_date: 2016-04-28 07:27:45
We don't actually reserve BTC for the fees. But if you move all BTC out of your wallet your balance becomes negative and the next time you deposit some Bitcoin the fee will be deducted from that amount.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:46:34
We pass on all transaction fees to our users. When you deposit to us and pay the deposit fee you pay us to consolidate the UTXO (unspent transaction outputs). This is something that is necessary to do in order to have a functioning wallet system. You can read more about it in our blogpost here: 
Previously we only charged a sending fee which included all fees, now we've split the cost between handling incoming transactions and just sending transactions according to what it costs us.

I am really sorry for the slow response times! Right now due to the growth in Bitcoin we've been swamped with tickets. Currently response time are between 2-7 days depending on what day of the week you open up your ticket.
I'm afraid that as per our Terms of Service if your account has been blocked for suspicious activity you will need to comply with our identification requests before you can withdraw.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:18:50
I am really sorry for that! We're experiencing significant growth, we're scaling as quickly as we can but so is the Bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:47:37
Actually that's not necessarily the case. Bitcoin nodes keep transactions in memory by default for 14 days (unless they run out of RAM or the operator has changed the default config).
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:22:43
Yep if the fee is high enough (But still low) they can be stuck much longer before the network forgets them.
160 USD in fees?! Your transactions must have *a lot* of inputs?

We're most definitely an exchange. We run a custodial wallet in order to support trades done through our escrowed P2P system.

It depends entirely on your local legislation. In some countries you need to register with your financial authorities before you begin selling Bitcoin for profit. In other jurisdictions there are no regulations.
Please consult with a local attorney if you have questions.

I am really sorry but right now we have a lot of support tickets and disputes open due to the massive growth in Bitcoin. Please have patience and wait, your dispute will be updated in the next 24 hours latest.

Those in Greece with BTC can still today live as normal, if they have places accepting bitcoin nearby.

True that, my bad. In my hastiness I thought you had linked to another chart.

IIRC there's not anything in the prospectus that states that they have to back the ETN with BTC.

Yep, there's no notable volume increase from Greece (rhymes!) that I can see which would explain the increase in transaction volumes or the recent rise in price.

When using LocalBitcoins you don't (and can't) connect your bank account to us. All trades happen with other users.
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:04:05
Actually, our largest market by volume or by number of trades is the USA.
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:28:37
I am not a lawyer, just a community manager so take this with a grain of salt and do your own research...
Selling on LocalBitcoins.com is safe, there are thousands of transactions conducted all over the world every day. The U.S. being our largest single market. 
As others have noted here, U.S. based exchanges *may* close down your accounts on their service if they notice that you re-sell coins on LocalBitcoins. This is so that they can comply with KYC &amp; AML regulations.
If you're a trader on LocalBitcoins it gets a bit murky. In the U.S. pretty much each state has it's own regulations regarding this. Some require you to get a license as an MSB and comply with AML &amp; KYC procedures. FinCEN has their own guidelines on the matter. I recommend you google around about bitcoin selling / trading in the U.S. There are threads here on reddit about it and on our forums on LocalBitcoins.com. We also have a lot of ProTraders who are from the States active on our forums, so it may be worthwhile for you to post this there, too.
Generally speaking though, when starting out it's highly recommended that you trade only small amounts. So that you can get used to the system and figure out what the most common scams are (they almost all revolve around chargebacks).
You can also contact me if you have any specific questions, and I'll do my best to answer. 
You can find our forums here:

Hey man!
I work over at LocalBitcoins as the community manager. I know the service can feel quite daunting for a new user, that's something we're working on to fix.
If you need any help or want some tips, feel free to ask. LocalBitcoins can be a great way to purchase your first coins, you'll get them easier than buying from say coinbase or circle, but it's a little more effort (but cheaper!) than ATM's.

I agree completely. Fighting scammers is very important, but it's also important to keep the site user-friendly. It's definitely something we need to constantly improve on.
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:59:54
Yep, the API on a whole isn't very updated :) It's something on our developers ToDo!
@_date: 2015-06-03 12:40:40
That's something we're constantly working on to improve. The p2p nature of the site in combination with how little people generally know about bitcoins make us attract scammers. We've also got a large amount of users who speak poor English who also get taken advantage of.
We've got one person specifically employed to implement features to help stop scams, hackers &amp; phishers. And we do so successfully a lot of the time.
We're constantly improving, the way to help us the most is to report ***every*** scam attempt to our support team by opening up a support ticket here

A centralized service does offer benefits. Our escrow service helps prevent fraud in A LOT of cases. Personally I think preventing fraud &amp; phishing to be the most difficult problem to solve with a truly de-centralized exchange.

Hi there, community manager from LocalBitcoins here.
PayPal is a *very* risky payment method. Someone who pays you in PayPal can reverse the transactions up to 180 days from making the payment. It's very easy for someone to scam with PayPal. 
If you're just using it for convenience purposes then I would suggest another payment method. 
PayPal only works for bitcoins when both parties of the trade have history and know each other, and even then it can be risky.
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:30:06
Of course, anyone who's registered or active on LocalBitcoins are a part of the community! 
We've never had a Community Manager before, the other people who are active on the forums are part of our support team. Now that's primarily my responsibility, but they'll be active as well :)
@_date: 2015-06-03 12:45:40
Thank you :) A completely de-centralized exchange will have a lot of trouble with scams/hacks/phishers if it ever manages to grow to our size.
We're completely 100% self funded with no need for any external funding (and have been since the start!). If you've got any ideas on where we should develop the site feel free to [contact us]( :)

I don't know how they technically do it, but yes we do provide new addresses for each transfer.
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:25:52
There'd probably be some liability issues with that, though. But it would be something that we could look into.

A large mempool causing full blocks can be offset to some degree by increasing the fee on transactions, but yes full blocks have caused headaches for us too.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:26:12
Max from LocalBitcoins.com here. The U.S. exchanges are the one that like to shut down accounts who send coins to bitcoin adresses owned by us. It's because they need to comply with AML &amp; KYC regulations, so they are very careful. 
There shouldn't be any issues with exchanges based outside of the U.S.
@_date: 2015-06-03 12:43:07
Quite low if you choose to buy or sell to a trader who has a high feedback percentage and a large volume of trades and an old account.
Always be weary though, if the price seems to good to be true...
We have several thousands of successfully trades a day and only a very small amount end up disputed.

Disputes are often very different, generally speaking if the seller claims the buyer hasn't paid we ask for verification from the buyer that he has paid. If he cannot provide adequate proof we side on the seller.
We can protect users bitcoins as long as they are in our escrow service, when a seller releases the coins there's nothing much that we can really do to help. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:26:11

Just a quick point, they haven't actually bought 4300 BTC. An ETN just follows the equivalent market value of bitcoins. Their total outstanding shares may have a value of 4 300 btc, but that value does not exist as btc anywhere.

AFAIK the situation is quite murky. I've heard FinCen has it's own requirements and if you listen to them, then there's some kind of a limit to how much you have to trade until you're considered a business and require a license.

Not for escrow, at least. We wouldn't want to give the seller the ability to take his coins out of escrow, it would remove the whole point of the escrow system.

It's mostly been users in the US who've been active traders that have had a problem with banks closing their accounts.
I'm not sure how much bitcoin you're selling, but if it's significant banks can become interested in it. This doesn't really matter where you sell your coins, if it's through our platform or any other one.
Make sure you use a reputable trader though, one with a lot of trades; good feedback and an old account.

At the end of the day we're a business, and we comply with all local regulations needed for us to be able to continue our business.
My own opinion of regulation is that it's a double-edged sword, it can both benefit business (by bringing transparency, legitimacy &amp; credibility). But if it's done wrong it can hurt or even make it unprofitable.
Right now we don't have any plans to release fraud statistics.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:00:12
The seller completely controls his own prices, generally speaking though the trades listed for new accounts don't have the best prices. Once you get reputation (both technically on our system, and with individual traders) you'll start to see advertisements with better prices.
Local Trades are safe, just make sure you choose a trader with good history. I.e. a lot of trades and a high feedback % with few negative feedbacks.

That's just where the founders of the company are from, so it was a logical choice. So far Finland has been relatively friendly to Bitcoin.

The average price is a poor indicator for what you actually pay. Tbh, it's also not a good assessment to think of us as one market, in reality there are many sub-markets on LBC that are all very different in terms of price premium.
Bank transfers, cash deposit etc. low risk payment methods generally have quite a low price premium of a few percent. For high risk payment methods like Gift Cards you see the price premium rocket up.
The vast majority of trades on our site occur with different types of bank to bank transfers, but the high risk payments skew the average upwards.

There are many different type of bank to bank transfers, wire is one type. There's SWIFT for international, SEPA in Europe, faster payments in the UK and then various other payment methods tied to bank accounts like Swish in Sweden. These can all be grouped together as "bank transfers".
Cash deposits are sort-of bank to bank transfers where only one bank is involved in the transaction.

Partly it's speed, the most popular payment methods on our site are ones where the Bitcoin seller sees the money instantly. This allows you to sign up, find a trader, make a payment and receive your bitcoins almost instantly.
Partly it's also anonymity, since it's other users on our platform offering Bitcoins for sale it's much easier to find a way to buy with an alternative payment method. 
Looking at the  website you can see that we see a lot of growth in developing countries, especially those with difficult economies or countries where remittance is popular.

These payment methods can be safe if you spend the card before you release Bitcoins from escrow. It's essentially comparable to a gift card, even though the user gives you the code he still has access to the card itself and can use it after you release escrow.
There is also the possibility that the user bought the Vanilla cards using illegitimate methods.
These types of payment methods are generally considered high risk by us when you're selling Bitcoins because of these risks.

The most popular one is easy to find out, it's the payment method that dominates the front page listings for the country in question. For the US, it's Cash deposit.

The vast vast majority of trades on our site are done online, local trades are a minority these days.
The top chart is measured in BTC, not in FIAT. As the price has been rising our BTC volume has been going down while our volume in FIAT has been holding steady. During the holiday's we've also seen an expected drop in sales as trades and buyers have both been offline during the holidays. As of this week trade volume is picking up again.

Sorry for the late answer! We're still around and are growing very rapidly. Most of the trades on our site are completed within an hour. With western union, make sure the trader is in your timezone and is actually able to pick up the payment when you make it (ask if his WU is open).

Hi! 
I'm really sorry that we've had to freeze your wallet, and that it's taken such a long time to investigate it. With the current spam attack on the Bitcoin network and the price rise our support staff have been under a lot of pressure.
We freeze wallets for many reasons, to protect user funds when we notice an account has been breached through e.g. phishing or when we have strong suspicion regarding fraudulent behaviour.
Can you DM me your ticket number or account username? I can take a look to see if we can speed up the process.
@_date: 2017-01-18 06:49:24
With Local trades one reason you see a price premium is because it takes a lot of TIME to do a local trade. From you talking with the seller and deciding a meetup point, to the traders travel time and cost to the meeting point and then to making the exchange itself.
People who sell Bitcoin don't do it for charity, they want to gain some profit for it.
Because local trades are very time consuming the premium is higher than, say, cash deposit trades where the seller can sit at home and refresh his online banking and do complete trades at once.

You've sent it with a transaction fee that's too low. If it's not sent from a wallet where you control the private keys there's not much that you can do.
If you did send it from a wallet where you control the private keys then you can try to bump the fee with CPFP if your wallet supports that feature.

Each transaction to an outside wallet requires a small fee paid to the blockchain.  We deduct the fee from your remaining balance. 
If you send the full amount in your wallet, we pay the fee (so that you receive the exact amount you sent) and then recover it next time you have bitcoin (placing your wallet in a very slight negative balance)

Gift cards is perhaps the worst way to buy Bitcoins, price wise, and security wise. I really would only recommend it as a very last resort.

Most likely you won't, police will not bother to investigate such a small fraud unless there are thousands of victims. And Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.

Hey! 
I'm really sorry that this has happened! Serve2Serve is listed as a high risk payment method because it's credit card based.
Though, most likely I believe it's not the seller that scammed you in this case but Amex that reversed the payment on their own, without the sellers consent. These things happen from time to time.
If you haven't already, please open up a support ticket and include some proof that the payment got reversed. We can then block the sellers account until he fixes the issue with the payment in your trade. If you like, you can PM me your support ticket number and I can take care of the case for you.
All the best,

As said by others we never lock accounts without reason and running a VPN is not against our terms of service and will not get you banned. Many of our customers are from countries where they can not trust the local government and use various tools to keep themselves anonymous.

Most payment methods exist on a spectrum from difficult to reverse to easy to reverse. You get a lower markup when you choose a payment method that is closer to the difficult to reverse side of the spectrum.
Gold is a good example of something that is very difficult to reverse, cash is good too. Both of those, though, require you to be physically present. There are cash derivative payment methods such as cash deposit and cash by mail that have the advantage of not requiring physical presence, but obviously pose other risks instead.
Cash deposit has turned out to be an especially good way of buying Bitcoin with relatively low markup, especially in markets where there are a lot of sellers.
Currently the best payment methods (i.e. lowest markup with fastest trade times) for Bitcoin is SWISH in Sweden and QIWI in Russia. Both of those because they are very difficult to reverse or to scam with and easy to verify for the seller.
@_date: 2016-12-20 06:22:34
I'm really sorry to hear that you think we turn a blind eye to behavior like this.

Fraud is a complete no-no on our site, if anyone even hints at being fraudulent they lose their account immediately. Running any form of P2P service means that there will always be some level of trust on the sellers which means fraud can't ever be 100% removed.

The first step should always be to contact our customer support, feedback is only shown to other users it does not get automatically reviewed by our customer support.
In these cases it's best to include some proof of the fraud so that we can ban the fraudulent user, hopefully before they withdraw their Bitcoin. In that case we can provide a reimbursement for the fraud, but reporting it quickly to us is key. During weekdays our support is staffed 24/7 and most tickets receive a reply within an hour, often faster.

Yep, it's good to keep in mind that LocalBitcoins is a marketplace more than an exchange - people will be stupid and try do illegal things with Bitcoin just the same as they try with USD or any other currency.

Credit Card is a VERY risky way to sell Bitcoin for any company. An 11% markup is relatively low. The markup has to be there to cover fraud and so they can earn a profit on selling.

They don't apply to us, but to the US based traders that sell bitcoin through us. As we're a P2P platform those to trade bitcoin with us need to make sure they're compliant to their local legislation. But because the BitLicense is also applicable to those outside of NY, we thought this was the best course of action to take.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:12:48
It's not a problem for us, but for the traders who are selling on our site. Since we're a P2P site it's technically not us who are doing the selling but those users who create sell ads.
Since we have a lot of users who have sell ads from the US and who may not know that they need to comply with the BitLicense  even if they aren't from NY when dealing with NY residents we thought it would be best to not allow NY residents to use the site anymore.

Max from LBC here!


Moneygram and Western Union can provide a quick and relatively secure way of sending money to a seller. Chargebacks through these services are more difficult to do, especially if you send cash. Equally, if the receiver doesn't pick up the money it's possible for the sender to take it back. You also do not need to provide your ID in order to send a Moneygram or a WU, something that many of our customers value. It's for these features that many pay 10 %. 
If you feel this is too expensive, you can also look for advertisements using bank transfers. This is the most popular payment method through our site. With this payment method, though, the Bitcoin seller will most likely ask you to provide identification to be sure that you are the same person as the bank account holder.


We have an escrow system in place, once you open up a trade with a Bitcoin seller the Bitcoin are automatically put into escrow. The Bitcoin seller can't take the Bitcoins back from here. Once you've completed payment (save the proof of payment!) and marked it so within the payment window the seller can release the Bitcoin. If he doesn't, you can open up a dispute with us, upload your proof of payment (e.g. moneygram receipt) and we'll resolve the dispute in your favor and give you the Bitcoin. 
You're completely protected as a Bitcoin buyer, as long as you have proof of payment.
Note: This only works for trades with escrow enabled. All online trades have it enabled by default. In Local Trades the escrow needs to be enabled manually by the seller.


Yes you can, though we don't recommend using online wallets as your primary wallet. With online wallets you are not in complete control of your Bitcoin.

I'm really sorry you had to experience this problem, and I'm equally sorry that we can't give a definite reason to the problem. We want to keep our architecture private for security reasons so I can't tell you where the problem was. These types of issues come up every now and then, partly due to our architecture. I can tell you though that the way we do things keep the coins that you store in our wallets secure, even in the case of a security breach by malicious parties. 
We do recommend users not to store all of their coin in their wallet on our site, only the coin that you need to trade. It's always best to keep the majority of your coins in a wallet that you have 100% control over.

As our algorithms for sorting advertisements depends on, among other things, trade volume those who aspire to trade bitcoin for a living sometimes trade below market in order to gain trade volume quickly and rise up higher in the listings. This'll give them more trade volume which makes it profitable to trade bitcoin as a business. Once they start getting enough trades from their position in the listings, they change their price back to above market.

Another reason is privacy. 
With Coinbase you're forced to go through a whole lot of AML and KYC processes. At LocalBitcoins you can sell your bitcoin for a banktransfer without having to give us any ID.

I'm very sorry that this happened to you :( 
First, contact our support and explain what happened with what user so that we can ban him. Making scammers lives difficult is the best deterrent.  
Next, Go file a police report about the fraud. 
Contact your bank and explain what happened to then and that you can prove that the transaction has taken place. 
MITM's are very hard to solve for law enforcement, as at first it looks as if you're the scammer.

Previously we didn't have an automatic system for adjusting fees based on how crowded the mempool was, we were adjusting fees manually. That wasn't much of a problem since the previous spam attacks were warned about in advanced, though we still had some slowdowns.

Buyer's are completely protected on our site from fraudulent users. Sellers do take on some risk due to the the inherent nature of Bitcoin being irreversible but most payment methods aren't. We do need to improve here, to make it more safe for sellers.

It will probably affect local trades the most, but at this time they're far less than ~10% of our volume. The vast majority of trades occur online and a large part of our online traders already require ID verification for new users in order to minimize fraud risk.

Selling for cash is by and large the safest and most scam proof way. The problem with bitcoins is that transactions are irreversible, whereas almost everything else isn't. 
Trading on LBC works based on trust. Most scammers use brand new accounts or accounts with very little history. It's possible to trade safely with every type of payment method as long as you familiarize yourself with the method and it's risks, and take necessary precautions against them.
Right now our documentation is admittedly in quite a sorry state, being at least one year old and out of date. I'm right now re-writing all of it to give more up-to-date information regarding trading.
@_date: 2015-07-18 17:57:45
You can ask the vendor directly on LocalBitcoins if you're unsure.
When you open a trade with a vendor you need to complete payment within the payment window, which is usually an hour or so. The vendor can choose this himself. It's best already be ready to transfer a moneygram before you open the trade so that you have sufficient time to send the money. If you don't send it within the payment window the trade will automatically cancel.
After you've paid you'll need to mark payment as complete in the trade on LocalBitcoins.com. And once the trader has verified your trade he will release the bitcoins from escrow. 
If you've got any more questions, I'm here to answer :)

When you buy or sell Bitcoins with PayPal to sellers on our site that are trusted there usually isn't a problem. But we still deem it a high risk payment method due to how many scammers use PayPal (mainly because PayPal's fraud detection and support isn't the best).

In general actions by banks that you experienced isn't unheard of. Many banks consider anything touching Bitcoin to be fraudulent behavior, even when there is nothing fraudulent taking place.

Yes, this is a known process problem. The banks require them to have on-hand the ID files of their trading partners. Currently the way our site is set up we cannot provide the ID photographs used for our internal ID verification to our traders.
This leads to the current situation where traders need to ask for ID's on their own. 
If you have trouble finding a suitable payment method, you can PM me and I can help you.
@_date: 2016-09-21 05:41:21
Slightly different scenarios. In Russia they blocked our domain and invalidated our SSL certificate, not to mention the block was implemented before they decided to not ban Bitcoin. They didn't implement a law that banned Bitcoin or made Bitcoin trading illegal.
The situation in Germany (and New York) is different. The authorities deemed it illegal to trade Bitcoin, this did not threaten us as much as the users who were selling Bitcoin on LocalBitcoins in those jurisdictions. Because of this risk, we decided to block all trading.
@_date: 2016-09-12 08:38:03

Hey! 
Sorry for the late answer, I didn't catch your post yesterday.
You were probably buying for bank transfer or Paypal, correct?
The reasons sellers ask for ID from you is because of the reversible nature of these payment methods, and how easy it is to fraud with them. It only takes a single scammer to get a sellers bank account closed, and then they're essentially without salary for a few weeks while they sort out the problem.
Asking for substantial proof of ID helps deter scammers, but it obviously also makes a lot of people nervous.
The best way to avoid this if it is something you're uncomfortable with is to buy Bitcoins using a payment method such as Cash Deposit, Western Union or Moneygram where sellers usually do not request ID verification as there's much much much less risk for them. You can also go the route of buying in person for cash, but most sellers require you to buy quite substantial amounts (&gt;100 GBP) for them to be interested enough to meet you.

Moneygram will have a higher fee and a higher price as the fraud risk for the seller is slightly higher. But it's not a bad payment method.

Cash deposit is one of the most popular ways to buy, for many reasons. In the US specifically it's because it's a very fast payment method to get your Bitcoin after paying, no need to wait for a wire transfer to complete. And because Cash Deposits are non-reversible it's also very safe for the seller, which means the price you pay is good.
@_date: 2016-09-20 12:53:02

LocalBitcoins is a peer to peer Bitcoin exchange, it means you're buying Bitcoin directly from other people. The site works similarly to eBay.
When you open a trade the Bitcoin you're buying are taken from the seller and put into escrow where they stay until the seller releases. The escrow makes sure that the seller can't run away with the Bitcoin once you've paid him.
You can check out our how to guide here:

As long as you've mark the trade as paid then there's no need to worry - the Bitcoin are held safe in escrow.
If you feel unsure you can always start a dispute as there's no penalty for doing that, except that the seller may feel a little annoyed that you didn't trust him.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:34:15
The other users are incorrect.
We have an escrow system in place, this means that when you open up a trade to buy Bitcoin we automatically take Bitcoin for the trade amount from the sellers wallet and put it in escrow where the seller can't take it back.
After you pay and mark the trade as paid the escrow is locked and won't automatically time out.
If the seller then doesn't want to release the Bitcoin to you you can start a dispute and one of our dispute agent will check your proof of payment and then release the Bitcoin to you.
@_date: 2015-09-30 08:39:46
Less fees for the merchant and no risk that the payment will be chargeback because of a stolen bank card. When merchants get chargebacks due to fraudulent cards they also get hit with a fee from the processor.
In Finland at least it is also very expensive to rent a credit card terminal (around 300 EUR a month) plus the monthly service fee to have the machine.
Overall, for the merchant it's much cheaper to go and buy an Android phone and use something like BitPay. Not to mention safer.

During the past two years there's been many password database leaks from large sites (Bitcointalk, Yahoo, Adobe etc.). If you've ever re-use the same password on any of these sites or your email it is likely that hackers have gained access to your accounts.
If you have login guard enabled on your account it requires the hacker to also have access to your email before getting access to your account.
I recommend you open up a support ticket and we can look in to why your account was breached.
If you have a negative Bitcoin balance it means your Bitcoins have been moved out. About a year or so ago we still allowed withdrawal of your full wallet amount and then debited the transaction fee from your now empty account making your balance negative.

The reason why the hard way turns out to be the easiest way is because of Bitcoins irreversibility. It's easy to reverse pretty much every other payment method, which is why anyone who sells Bitcoin is putting him or herself at some risk for fraud. 
Cash deposits are one of the few payment methods that are nearly irreversible.

It does cause quite a lot of headache and stress for online wallet operators, like us. Even with dynamic fees implemented we can still suffer from delayed transactions.

I disagree here, using a BIP70 compatible wallet on my phone I find it extremely convenient to pay for e.g. groceries. 
A real life example is the grocery store that's close to my families cottage. Packing the car for the long drive and then stopping at the grocery store to buy food for the weekend it's very convenient to just take my phone with me from the car and scan a QR code from the stores android phone while paying.
It is very convenient when the business is used to accepting bitcoins and know how their device works, it's awkward when they don't. But the same goes for any other payment system, when you're faced with a new cashier who doesn't know how to use the card reader paying with a credit card is awkward, too. 
The biggest reason why businesses don't accept Bitcoins is because we don't even try to pay.

Hi! Could you PM me your LocalBitcoins username? We're trying to figure out what's going on here as this is quite strange.
@_date: 2016-10-19 05:16:26
We've been around since 2012 and we're incorporated in Finland, an EU country with great consumer protection laws.
I'd advise against mixing Bitcoin with PayPal as you'll not get a very good price selling your BTC. If you're in the us look in to cash deposit instead.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:25:34
I'm afraid that I cannot give out legal advice. This depends entirely on where you live &amp; the laws enforced there. Generally speaking, if you have reason to believe something may be money laundering, it is not a good idea to go through with it. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 06:20:24
There's a company called xbtBase that helps with cryptocurrency compliance issues in the US. It may be a good idea to give them a call.
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:40:22
You can register for any of the large exchanges, though you'll probably pay more in bank transfer fees. 
For a small amount like that you will not get a good price as it's not wortwhile to anyone to sell so little.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:17:06
Yes, that is money laundering or even fraud. Do not agree to it. Can you please DM me the trade number where he suggested that so that we can investigate?
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:36:13
This data isn't public, but the number of trades in VEF also went up 10% last week. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:28:45
In the US due to how ancient the banking system is it makes it difficult to find good ways to trade Bitcoin.
Currently, cash deposit is the most popular payment method on our site in the US as it is instant, low risk for the seller and gives you the best price in the market.

Venezuela is still quite small in volume, but has nice growth. The UK has been a good market for a long time and has recently started growing again. Australia, India, Kenya, Mexico and Norway are also other countries that have been looking good lately.
@_date: 2015-09-17 10:02:28
Be sure to set up some ads using LocalBitcoins, we've been seeing increased demand in Ukraine during the past few months. The number of transactions has tripled since May. You can send me a PM if there's anything you want to ask!

They are a huge risk.
Anyone with the code can redeem them, you don't know who has the code. It can be redeemed 30 second after you send the Bitcoin. It can be stolen. It can be bought with a stolen credit card and so forth.
Bank transfers are safe(r), but nothing is completely safe. With bank transfers you run the risk of receiving a transfer from a hacked account or from a MITM scammer, this will cause you to lose your bank account.
Before you start trading Bitcoin I recommend doing a lot of research on Reddit and the LocalBitcoins forums. There's lot's of good information there on risks and ideas on how to mitigate them. 
@_date: 2016-10-01 07:32:20
Generally any payment method that isn't reversible is safe.
Cash deposit, Moneygram, Western Union, Cash in Mail are all very safe choices. 
The most important factor, though, is to choose a reliable buyer. An older user with many trades and few negative feedbacks will dramatically lower your chances of anything funny happening. Selling Bitcoin to a new user with very few trades for a reversible payment method is asking for trouble.
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:48:44
The risk with using ToR is a malicious exit node doing a Man in the Middle attack on the SSL certificate, making it appear as everything is fine when it's not.
@_date: 2016-10-12 08:11:21
Accounting and Bitcoin is still not simple :)

In the US especially there is also other federal and state regulations you need to look in to. If you're doing this for profit you will have to register as an MSB.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:27:34
Buying Bitcoin is very safe. When you sell Bitcoin you're at risk of fraud. This risk exists because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible whereas all traditional money systems are reversible.
It's this reversibility that scammers abuse. Technically the problem isn't with Bitcoin, it's traditional payment methods and institutions that have very lax rules around fraud prevention as they can just pull the funds after the fact.
Since Bitcoin exchanges and companies can't issue chargebacks we need to put more emphasis on fraud prevention BEFORE any money changes hands.
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:08:29
Hi! I work at LocalBitcoins, we do not have any official apps. So it's most likely fake.
Could you give me a link to it? 
**This application is fraud**
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:50:53
Unfortunately for Bitcoin traders if they get even one fraudulent payment (i.e. from a hacked bank account) they can lose their bank account and have all the funds frozen.
Traders must make sure the person who is paying is the owner of the bank account or they risk losing their whole business.
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:08:09
This is probably the prettiest one yet. Good job, we like it! :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:19:30
Don't ever sell Bitcoins out of escrow if you're dealing with a person.
Selling to reputable traders with low-risk payment methods is safe, e.g. selling on our site to traders with 3000+ trades and 100% feedback with bank transfer or cash deposit. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 10:19:00
You'd definitely be surprised.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:26:49
That is actually surprisingly difficult to do.
@_date: 2016-10-29 13:20:34
If you're not registered at a large exchange our site gives you VERY quick access to Bitcoin. If you're in e.g. the UK which has a very well functioning banking system you can be KYC approved by a trader and have Bitcoin in your wallet in 15 minutes. If you're in Sweden or Russia even faster, within minutes, if you buy using Swish or Qiwi.
As our traders are all local you're able to buy Bitcoin using bank transfer in countries where no other "large" exchange operates.
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:17:23
It would mostly depend on which country you're in. If you're in the EU you can select Bank transfer or Specific bank transfer. If you're in the US you can select bank wire. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 06:58:44
I'm sorry to say that you're a victim of a phishing attack :( 
You most likely clicked on a link in an e-mail that led you to a site that looked just like LocalBitcoins, but with the URL being different. Thinking you were on the real site you logged in as normal. Most phishing sites redirect you to the real site as soon as you've logged in. If you don't pay attention and look at the address when you log in it's very hard to spot these.
Logging in to the phishing site gave the phisher your login credentials, then he just waited until there was BTC in your wallet...
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:22:15
The main reasons is to prevent fraud and for the traders to help win disputes with their payment provider. If you report a payment as fraud to the payment provider the Bitcoin seller needs to prove he actually dealt with you or he will lose the dispute.

Solve the online identity problem and you'll be a billionaire :)
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:20:16
Easiest and quickest is honestly cash deposits through LocalBitcoins. It's irreversible and pretty difficult to scam with.
Generally speaking the closer to market price the advertisements on LocalBitcoins are, the less risky the payment method. 
If someone is selling Bitcoin below market price, it's not really a good idea to buy.
@_date: 2015-11-24 08:46:51
One thing I would like to point out is that LocalBitcoins is so far completely self-funded and owned by the original founders. We have not seen a need to raise any outside funding. And yes, we're profitable.
@_date: 2015-10-28 09:33:01
Thank you for bringing this up. We're aware that our service is not always easy to user and that certain pages are clear. We've recently made some changes to our development process in order to be able to better address these issues.  Hopefully you'll start seeing improvements soon.
All the best,
Community Manager

Now that's pretty comprehensive!

Hey Blader05! This does definitely look like we've made a mistake, and I'm really sorry for it.
I've replied to the support ticket that you've opened, if you have any further questions, please let me know.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:21:00
Just checking to make sure - did your transaction show up?
@_date: 2015-11-02 07:55:14
Please open up a ticket with our support and we can take a look. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:41:08
It is more likely to be a man in the middle scam, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:57:33
Yes you can, the vast - vast majority of transactions on our platform occur using online payment methods. 
After you've registered on our site you can us the orange box on the front page to search for an advertisement that works for you. Be sure to check out the seller before starting a trade that you're comfortable trading with him, General rule of thumb is a high feedback percentage (99-100%) and a large trading history. As a buyer you are 100 % protected through our escrow system, in case a trader gives you trouble you can easily start a dispute on the trade.
Coinbase is another option - but it'll take you much longer before you're able to purchase the BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:04:15
That is not true, all PayPal transactions can be charged back. Most PayPal chargebacks happen because the Payment wasn't sent by the account owner but by someone who hacked/phished the PayPal account.
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:21:59
This is *not* our application. It is a phishing application that is trying to get access to your account by having you activate HMAC authentication for your account.
@_date: 2016-10-26 11:12:20
As others have said, if your transaction shows up as unconfirmed on the Blockchain we can't confirm it. We've unfortunately got no way to help your incoming transaction confirm faster.
Right now there's a huge backlog on the Blockchain which is causing delays for many of our customers, I'm sorry to say that there's nothing else that can be done but wait :(
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:22:55
For incoming payments to Bitcoin companies the malleability attack can be a bit of a headache, depending on how things are implemented. It's mostly just a nuisance as wallet balances remain correct since your transaction do go through.
If you have a system that tracks transactions using e.g. it's TXID your system can easily get confused because of the malleability attack. I suspect this is the issue that BitPay is having. 
When a user creates a transaction and broadcasts it, the receiving company's system finds it and starts to track it based on the TXID. However, the attacker conducting the malleability attack sends out a new transaction which is exactly the same except that the TXID is slightly modified. If it is this second transaction, that your system isn't tracking, is the one that gets confirmed by the blockchain it can have some consequences.
If the system is tracking the transaction using the original TXID it will show the transaction as being unconfirmed, since the original transaction is the one that was rejected by the Blockchain. To the system, the BTCs that come in to the wallet are a completely different transaction as the TXID is different than the expected transaction.
What ends up happening is the receiving wallet has the correct balance, but the tracking system is confused.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:26:33
Yes it is normal, you will have to go through similar verification on all Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:08:46
Yep, everything's good over here! We've never had any issues about slow escrow releases. It's just the seller who's not releasing.
@_date: 2015-10-07 06:45:47
I would recommend going to an ATM and withdrawing cash with your debit card or credit card and then purchasing the giftcards. I don't really see why you can't do this?
Remember to save the receipt as proof of purchase, most traders require this!
@_date: 2015-10-06 13:09:23
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:00:18
If you're a brand new user I would not recommend creating an ad, rather start trading by replying to other peoples ads.
Once you have some reputation and trades under your belt your advertisements will receive much better visibility in our system.
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:35:41
Yes, Bitcoin can always be transferred anywhere.
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:06:38
If you're buying Bitcoin for yourself there is no risk. Our escrow system protects you against fraudulent traders, you're not at risk for violating money laundry laws for buying Bitcoin. It only becomes something you need to worry about when you start selling Bitcoin professionally. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:54:30
Thanks, we're aware of the site but there's little that we can do to stop it. As with most phishing-type sites if the user clicking it believes it is legit there isn't much we can do to prevent them from using it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:57:37
If you're selling Bitcoins following this guide there is very little risk: 
If you operate as a business without a license then you're breaking the law.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:28:20
If you're just replying to other users ads you will be fine.
