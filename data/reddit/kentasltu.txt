It's down for me for some reason.
For the wallet, what would be the best temporary method to hold bitcoin without hardware wallet?

I have hear about paper wallet. How do I proceed with such option?
Do I write down the code or something on paper and just keep it or what?

Well, what can I say. 
You definatelly earned all of those coins by your own two hands and your head.
I believe that you are a good person and karma came back all the way around, by presenting this file with all the records. You had rough before, as you explained, thus things should go well again for you.
I'm not an expert of safety or security, and don't have much experience in BTC, but yeah, keep safe and watch your self, as there are tons of bad people out there, desiring what you "discovered" right now. 
From the posts and replies you seem like an honest person as well, but sometimes honesty (especially on the Internet) can hurt you (I consider myself honest person too, luckily didn't get hurt by that trait yet).
Anyway, thank you for sharing your story. :)

Really, people begging for coins? No one is going to send you anything, get real. The man has to figure out how to recover the coins, so the last thing he would do is send you some coins when he recovered them.
Of course, humans are greedy deep in their essence, not excluding myself I guess.
Anyway, good for you man. I sometimes dream that I would go back in time and instanstly buy bitcoin, then by now I would have "finished life", like you finish a video game.
