Ya dude, the owner of bitcoin is gonna be super rich once this Ponzi scheme is revealed to the world. /s 
You've done zero research into Bitcoin besides typing "is Bitcoin a scam??" Into Google and clicking on the 1st link. 
Just zoom out on the charts my dude. Learn what Proof of Work algorithms achieve in a sense outside of Bitcoin and how hashes are used to link together data and provide quick(er) methods to verify transactions. 
The coin is worth whatever some guy will pay for it, but the techniques and programming paradigms that gave rise to Bitcoin (please read the white paper and look At the OPEN source code on github) hold immense value.

More businesses that support the coin, the better. And you won't have to deal with bullshit chargebacks(where customer gets what they ordered as promised and just wants to pull a fast one) as a a vendor. Not sure how common that is in your industry
