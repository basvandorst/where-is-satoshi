I was so fucking happy with myself when i cashed out before going to bed to avoid the dip....
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:56:35
I cashed out to fiat to buyback a fart lower and the bastard went up €500!  
I'm willing to sell advance notice of my next cash out .....
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:43:39
Use the Revolut method, LBC is terrible for prices.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:33:54
Hey! I'm nothing like that! But if somebody will lend me 80k i'm willing to give it a try! :)
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:22:41
It's because i've bought in.  
Sorry about that.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:27:51
But that's when prices shoot up and I could have an extra 5 bucks today!
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:28:38
Been playing on gdax for a week now, todays lesson is "pee in a jar under your desk", NEVER leave the keyboard.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:33:45
Yeah, BTC &amp; ETH have been bloody stationary all afternoon. Well annoying.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:20:48
Yeah, but this ICO i've read about is going to be like ICO before!
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:19:01
Damn right, soon as my credit card is approved i'm going for it!^/s
@_date: 2019-07-28 13:54:51
Faceapp is fucked anyway, mine went passed the "aged" setting straight to "decomposing". Bastards.
@_date: 2018-09-15 10:52:13
Don't worry, I'm fine. My wife wants to blow the money on Xmas anyway.
@_date: 2018-09-22 16:45:54
Don't take the bait, don't take the bait...  
Fuck it, no, this is for real bitcoin.  
I am weak. :(
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:04:25
Like the evil dark humour first responders develop? Like "hahaha, everything's on fire and that okay" sort of fun?
@_date: 2018-09-23 17:45:33
Yeah, she's screwed no matter what choices she puts forward really. I'm surprised anybody wanted the job after Cameron fucked the country.  
As for the pound falling on it's arse, i'm thinking of stashing away my "spare" monthly cash as euros and letting the fall of the pound cover a car payment when i convert it back :)
@_date: 2018-09-23 19:06:01
Yeah, but my car payments are still in GBP :(
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:55:52
I'm trading in Euros and watching my  GBP value increase purely from the damage she is doing to the value of the pound.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:12:50
I had a few hundred bucks of ETH &amp; LTC, and now i don't. I've still got the ETH &amp; LTC but now it's not a few hundred bucks worth, oops!
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:30:59
Yup, every time they are reporting on the death of Bitcoin as it's dropped 20% in two days it's usually back up 8-10% by the time the publish their news.
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:53:41
Why do these stories never come out until the coins are already recovering?
@_date: 2018-05-06 07:50:17
$5000 fees? What fucking drugs are you taking? Because you're tripping your tits off.
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:30:24
Dude, the call centers tailor their scam to their victims locale.  
It wouldn't make sense to threaten a Canadian with the IRS or an American with HMRC would it?
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:53:59
There is. 
 And it will be easy. 
Everybody knew *exactly* what they were voting for.  
Right down to the soft border in the Irish sea and N.I. actually staying in the customs union.....  
There is a reason I trade in Euros!
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:21:41


... with public money they were given to bail them out...
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:39:23
Yup, that's why we're all winging it with indepth knowledge we learned from other people on the internet ;)
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:19:53
Good spam grabs your attention, this one just needs a fucking translator.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:33:01
Oh do fuck off, there's a good bot.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:45:46
I had to run seti on work stuff, my home rig at the time was a BP6 board with dual 60mm deltas. I no longer have that girlfriend.
@_date: 2019-10-04 08:55:03
It's days like this that I'm pissed I ran seti on the spare cycles and nothing that would have made me bank.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:12:11
It's fine tuned, if somebody falls for the syntax, they'll usually fall for the scam.  
If they pick up it's a scam, they get dropped quickly and the scammers don't waste time.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:12:22
People who think they are getting in at the bottom of the dip. Like me. Oops!
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:02:04
Didn't work, going to try shouting at it some more.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:17:33
And I'm sat here waiting for my euros to transfer to Coinbase-&gt;Gdax. Hurry the fuck up will you, I got buying to do!
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:26:30
This one gets my upvote, it has the right proportion of terrifying instant after purchase drop followed by tiny, tiny gain.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:43:17
If the price could stay in the toilet (or even make a bid for the u-bend) until my funds load into gdax, that would be great.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:09:31
Haha, nice try, I already bought the dip.  
Then it dipped quite a bit more :(
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:10:21
Where are you buying/selling ETH for GBP? I'm stuck bouncing back and forth via Euros.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:33:03
Quad HD7950 ftw! (for the winter!)
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:07:57
Or, we aren't buying more because the bloody funds haven't transferred yet!
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:35:09
This is great news to fight the anonymous terrorist money bullshit. A copper that understands technology, awesome.  
Yes, I know a wallet isn't tied to a name &amp; address, but the funds are trackable.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:18:49
That's a load of FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:08:36
FUD much?
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:08:45
Anybody else having trouble with Gdax after the latest page update? My price graph has stopped updating and my fiat currency now has 8 decimal places! This is on mobile btw.  
edit - it's definitely my device not the site, checked the wifes phone (same model, S7), hers is fine.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:08:20
Preferred the BBC explanation.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:44:57
Panic. Panic now, they're pulling a Nicehash! ^/s
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:56:47
Yeah, but cards at 99% of regular card retail price, with almost zero warranty, and no video outputs (meaning no resale value) were never going to be that popular...
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:15:16
Got the idea from my comment in that thread saying exactly this thing? Wow.   
Edit - downvotes for pointing out OP is nicking ideas from others. Awesome.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:46:59
I've ridden the dip down to €7000, juggling the €20-€30 swing on the way.  
Now it's hit 7k and i'm up against a wall of 48 BTC, i've bottled it and stepped away from the keyboard!
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:33:38
This will be fun, it reopens around the same time as the kids wake up.....  
Edit, holy shit, things are up in the air, opened coinbase app to find €10 of BTC I didn't know I had. Checked a few other pages and now it's gone!
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:23:39
Is GDAX about to run out of Lytecoin trades??
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:50:23
Ended up working it down to €6600, then it popped back to 7200 in a mater of minutes, waiting to see if this is a bounce.....
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:07:29
If the media could wait till i get hold of some more euros, that would be great.  
I bought on the dip and it kept dipping .......
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:05:58
Seconded, LBC has fucking horrendous fees and rates.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:31:14
I thought the porn had been encoded onto the small text section on the end of the block which can be pruned/deleted once the block is confirmed?
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:01:03
No because dad's are cool and mothers are highly strung.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:22:39
And my funds clear two hours after the price starts to go back up, arse!
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:30:07
No joy.  
Just tried in the phones default browser (which i've never used) and it is showing the same broken price chart. Odd.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:15:35
I get back from the school run and the weak hands are shitting the bed.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:07:52
I've refreshed the page, closed the browser app and restarted it, and restarted my phone, nothing changes.  
Makes quick buying a pain too, can't just tap to spend all my fiat as it complains that my spend is "too accurate", i currently have 6.40533669 euros available!  
edit - mad, just did the "request desktop view" and even that doesn't show the recent price chart, just stops midway through yesterday.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:28
This is what concerns me, the moment they get a green light from their respective gov/regulators, they kick it around like any other commodity, pouring a shit ton of fiat into the pot to push the value in the direction they want.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:18:26
Way ahead of you, I keep mine on the exchange so I can never forget my key!
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:03:33
How are you watching me???!!!
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:40:57
And nothing of value was lost.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:10:51
Assholes! They've pushed it out an extra hour, we'll be loading the kids into the van to go to school when it goes live. Fuuuuuuuuck.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:49:16
This is the article I got it from -   
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:15:32
Anybody else want to spam 10c to a couple dozen accounts and put "Payment for sale of bitcoin" in the info.....
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:33:45
I'm mining with Nicehash, making more trading though. And i'm not doing that well trading!
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:15:03
Yup, i get back from taking the kids to school and noobs are shitting themselves over a maintenance outage.
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:05:07
It's 2am here, let me sleep!  
&lt;pours coffee&gt;

Hey, you're the guy who advertises on the Facebook sales pages aren't you? I always miss out getting those bitcoins for £1500 :(
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:04:43
Where is the link to the actual report though? This is a news piece saying that there is a report, but doesn't actually quote any text or point to it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:14:17
If you want to buy bitcoin, buy bitcoin.  
If you want to buy bcash, buy bcash. And seek help.
