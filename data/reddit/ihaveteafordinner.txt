Why has this gone on for so long without a reply or any sort of notice? Mtgox has just gone tits up and now we learn a site you run smells just like  it, no support since end of last year and emails unanswered. I for one have just lost all confidence in coinjar.

This is 100% bullshit 
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:55:13
freenode  is the official support channel,  for general moaning.

The only 100% reliably way is face to face and see the transaction go through right there and then.  Trusting other people with you're money in an unregulated market is always going to be a risk, even in a regulated market you could still call it a risk.  
I believe btcmarkets are undergoing a face change but until they're transparent about who they are then I'm not touching them either.

First post, nothing on IRC.. fake as shit.

I look forward to your next post about coinjar, 3 months after they've stopped responding to support requests.

Edit: op has edited their post and done a better job than me, good call.
I've heard about this before but you're post was a little difficult to read, so I tried to format it:


They didn't find someone to acquire them until June 2012.  
International (non-US) players were paid back first.  
Only today were US players finally paid back the money that was tied up in their accounts.  
It took 1 year to find someone to acquire the company, and 3 years for everyone to finally get paid back.  
This company was top 2 in it's industry.  
The amount of money was on the order of magnitude of the amount lost by Mt. Gox. ($300M+).   
Mt.Gox presentation makes it seem like this thing will be easily taken care of.  
On the one hand, the government froze the Full Tilt assets and it's pretty common knowledge that governments move slow, but even finding someone to acquire them took a year.  
On the other hand the assets of Full Tilt Poker existed somewhere, and weren't stolen.  
 


It's still a little difficult to read.

Whether he has credibility or not he was employed by mtgox.com and is only the only person that continues to communicate.

Not really 'breaking' is it then.

Hit the nail on the head.

You come across in a very aggressive manner.  I didn't use the word 'scam'.  If you were a litigate business one thing you would have done is meet the needs and questions of your potential customers with curtsy rather than a barrage of abuse.  
All I can think of is if your were legit and I had a problem with my order how would you respond?  At the moment it seems I'd just get abused.

Damn dude, spread the wealth! :p  
I wonder how much sits in it's wallet? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:11:18
$10 in 10 seconds? pleeeaseeee....

Pretty cheap way to put his business in the news, gets the attention of not only the small parentage of bitcoin users but gets his name in the media for all those that don't.
edit: He's on the ball though, some damn good reasons.

Take a picture of the beef in your hands then.

Well that was a nice thing to wake up to, ta!
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:00:31
Do you mean converting your bitcoins to fiat or actually transferring bitcoins from mtgox to your own wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:14:00
Been waiting 8 days for support to contact me, join the club.
  Edit: Apparently they've hired more staff to cope with demand.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:36:54
Same but I'm interested in spending a bit of cash riding it up, buying and selling in the sort term.  I've also signed up for btcmarkets.net although the lack of information they're willing to give out about themselves of their page is a bit untrusting.

Make Fake letter.  
People panic and shut down their EC2 miners.

Shame you're not in my neck of the woods, my bitcoin fund is hopefully going to pay for my flying lessons.  Only I have to cash them out first.
