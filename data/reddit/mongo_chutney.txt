Apparently torguard  ( I think anyway) has started accepting LN payments on the main net and are covering any fuck ups that may occur.
Given that a) the technology is still being tested and b) involves people's money, the vast majority of LN devs want it implemented when it's working perfectly, and quite rightly.
At this point, if LN was released and adopted when it isn't ready, it would do irreparable damage.
I do agree that in the meantime it could slow down btc's price growth which may cut into btc's market dominance but like I said above, I'd rather something done right than right now
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:16:54
R/bitcoinmarkets is a good place to start. I personally would not recommend day trading unless you have a  good understanding of how to trade. With the volatility of bitcoin being what it is, it's a very quick way to lose a lot of money unless you know what you're doing.
Best of luck to You!
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:36:04
Maybe that's why they want to introduce regulations? It's a lot easier to set the standard they must adhere to before an exchange exists than it is to impose it after the fact
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:39:03
Hard to say. Stability and confidence has returned for now but how long that will last is anyone's guess. It could skyrocket or could dip again.
Fwiw I'm cautiously optimistic that we are through the worst of it but anything could happen. 
I'd set a couple of buy orders of .1 at the current price and one 10% lower to take advantage if a dip happens 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:51:06
Unfortunately I'm too drunk to properly explain it but there's quite a few posts on the sub that should make it clear for you.
Potentially it could be revolutionary and be the catalyst that makes bitcoin truly mainstream. 
There's still a way to go before it's ready for mass adoption but signs are promising so far!
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:41:29
There may very well be a cryptocurrency crash like the dot com bubble.
Even in that case, the strongest coins with the best tech, devs and use, will survive and become the dominant currency. Much like how the dot com bubble didn't stop Amazon or Google. 
Much like a correction will shake out the weak hands, the bubble popping will kill off the shitcoins and scams
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:59:19
Probably not. I should probably try to think about what I'm trying to say.
I guess I was trying to say that btc has recovered from crashes relatively quickly in the past, the major exception being the bear market following mtgox.

To be fair, you drive a new car off the forecourt and you lose nearly 50% of its value.
At least btc has a good chance of going higher 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:22:44
There's solid support in the 10k range so if it does dip below that, it'd be short lived.
Though it has struggled to get above 13k, overall sentiment is good, the mempool is clearing and txs are getting cheaper and quicker.
Aside from tether blowing up or an unforeseen event, btc should be in good shape 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:36:25
Unless you bought a couple hundred you'll be sweet!

But you have less than $100 in btc?
Don't worry, one day you'll get that lambo
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:19:25
I would hardly call this a crash.
Support appears quite solid at 10.5k, any dip lower than that will be short lived.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:57:47
Fuck knows.
Futures are settling tomorrow, it's also payday for some and we will be leaving January which is usually a slow/negative month trading wise.
Recent news about bitcoin has been mostly positive. LN is performing well on the testnet  (and also on the main net) which is promising. The mempool is clearing and fees are lower.
Support for the price appears to be stable at 10.5k. Any dips below that have been short lived.
Overall sentiment appears quite good so barring any major shit the bed moment, things are looking bullish 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:23:52
I think they expire 9pm gmt, so that's 8pm for you?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:18:34
Well when the futures opened, it was like any other day. I'm hoping them closing will be the same. Normality will return, I'll be able to get some work done without being constantly distracted, memes will be posted and moons will be promised. 
Or it could continue to shit the bed with the lights on.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:18:34

Though in honesty, this is what a volatile market looks like. Unfortunately it's not all moon and lambos. 
The best thing to do is take a step away for a while and not get too bogged down in the short term price

@_date: 2018-01-25 12:28:09
I'm hedging insofar I've bought today and prepared to buy tomorrow in case of a dip.
Support appears stable at 10.5-11k so any dip below that should be short lived.
Regardless of my intention to avoid charts or not, I know I'm going to be checking in every hour
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:05:52
I (most likely incorrectly) view a proper crash as something that it doesn't recover from over a short period of time.

Interesting. Where do you believe it's true price lies?
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:41:11
Given that there has been a couple of occasions where the tx fees were more than the block reward, I don't see that being a problem in the future as the price of bitcoin  (and the amount of txs processed in a block) will still make it a very lucrative venture.
However that wont happen until 2140 so fuck knows what state cryptocurrency and the world will be in then

Although it's still in testing, progress has been promising.  I'd be surprised if there isn't an android wallet out in 12 months. 
Potentially it will kill most of the shitcoins and altcoins and be the catalyst that makes bitcoin mainstream.

Honestly if you don't have any experience trading, day trading crypto will most likely end with you losing your money.
Many people  (myself included) have lost money day trading without spending a lot if time learning how the markets work and/or trading emotionally rather than logically.

The only thing coinbase respects is money. Educate users of coinbase's shortcomings and urge them to avoid using them. The less traffic, users and money they have, the less power and influence they can hold over bitcoin.
It's idealistic to think that way, I know but we should all aspire to be bigger, better people.
Fwiw hypocrisy aside, I do find it funny though 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:46:38
On the positive side, fees are lower so you'll get more coin for your money when you buy.
For those who recently got into crypto, ask yourself this - has your belief in the fundamentals and the tech of bitcoin changed in the last week? 
If no, hodl. If yes, why did you invest in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:41:17
Depends if you define a crash as an event that it won't recover from or not.
It has crashed many times and always recovered  (eventually)

To be fair, he is not wrong 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:39:42
It's possible but widespread adoption make take some time. While it is performing well on the testnet and are operational nodes on the main net, until it has been tested and all bugs discovered and fixed there are no guarantees when it will be ready.
If segwit is anything to go by it could take some time for exchanges to implement it, however it is possible that they are waiting for LN to be ready before rolling out segwit. 
As for the impact it will have on the altcoins, that's anyone's guess.
If LN works as promised and fees become nearly non existent  off chain and low on chain, then the use case for bch in particular will be reduced. ETH  and LTC might be ok, as with coins with specific use cases or solid fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:03:11
That's wonderfully vague. 
I'm not sure how they could regulate bitcoin itself, the exchanges definitely though (and to an extent should be welcomed) and some of the ICOs have been downright shady at best.
It could be seen as a positive move to legitimise bitcoin but we all know how well this space react to news like this

The mempool has been quite clogged since the beginning of december, given that 90% of the txs are 50 sats/bytes and above it would be an extremely expensive spamming.
It's more down to the massive volume of new users to bitcoin and people moving money around due to the difficulty change and performance of alt coins.
Hopefully there will be less tx activity over Christmas and New year's so the backlog will clear and if segwit reaches 50% adoption, the mempool won't get as clogged...
*hopefully *
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:57
Anywhere from $10 to $100,000
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:17:16
An easy assumption would be the many thousands of new people getting into bitcoin and all the txs that occurs when buying and transferring bitcoin to a wallet?
If there was an overwhelming amount of txs with low fees then I'd be more suspicious but I'm more inclined to believe it's primarily down the bitcoins recent explosion.
That's not to say I wouldn't be surprised if it was a coordinated attack given the amount of money at stake
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:34:39
While I am excited for LN and the other developments, I can't help but feel that a temporary blocksize increase would clear the tx backlog and get fees down.
I fully understand that 8mb blocks would lead to centralised nodes over time, however for the here and now, is there any reason why larger blocks can't be used in times where there is a backlog? Is it possible to switch from 4mb blocks back down to 1mb during times of lower tx volume or does block size need to be fixed at all times? 
There has been so much interest and new users coming to bitcoin, which is amazing but the way things have been for the last week has shown the vulnerabilities when faced with high tx volume.
I'm hoping the tx backlog is temporary, that it's down to new users getting in on the bitcoin train but I am concerned that it's not showing bitcoin in the best possible light and is allowing other coins to capitalise on that 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:09:06
It is much worse than that.  It's like if bill gates pointed and laughed at a homeless person and the public donated money to him and bill took the credit for it

I'm in the same boat.
I could kick myself for not getting into bitcoin when I heard about it for the first, second or seventh time. But I dont. Because I am in it now.
The potential for it to go to the moon is still there and the only way you will be a part of it, is if you get involved.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:49:07
*puts on tin foil hat*
If enough of the money that has come into btc over the last month/year has come from the stock markets, when futures trading goes live they could open a short position,  sell off their own btc and possibly trigger panic selling of other weak hands.
It is possible, the last few months has seen massive increases in btc price with little in the way of a major correction. 
Either btc is too resilient with its present true value being close to what it is at the moment, or tethers are propping up the price somewhat or a combination of the two.
Either way, I'm expecting more volatility
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:54:31
Essentially yes. It's like adding extra lanes to a highway when you really need to build bypasses

2x was supposed to happen in early November but got called off at the beginning of the month.
But yeah, the last 6 weeks has been crazy. I feel like I've aged a decade
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:37:34
Definitely with big txs. Depends on the nature of the tx I guess. 
I can't help but think that fees would be a lot lower if people checked the mempool to figure out the lowest fee they could get away with. It wouldn't help with the backlog but it would save people money.
And more segwit adoption. That'd be lovely
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:25:22
Then go for it. It will hopefully prove to be a very wise investment. 
It is worth the risk as myself and many others will attest 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:56:19
Contributing to the decentralised currency. Surely that reason alone should be enough for those who value bitcoin as a decentralised currency?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:55:20
It has the potential to solidify bitcoin as the most effective cryptocurrency and render some of the forked coins useless in comparison.
That is not to say there won't be more forks in the future, but bitcoin's position will be stronger and more resistant to challenges against it

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:55:19
However at a certain point where big blocks can be used without risking centralisation, more txs can fit in a block so fees would be less?

It was live on BBC 1, so no dice there brother
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:48:06
To be honest, stepping away from reddit has made life easier. It's too easy to get wrapped up in the drama here and get susceptible to FUD. 
I think things will settle now that btc is consistently above 10k 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:07:19
With futures trading starting soon, there will be an attempt to short btc. How successful that will be is anyone's guess
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:52:40
Anything is possible. The way that the market has been, I'd be more surprised if it stayed above 15k.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:56:08
Bch won't be ignored because it functions as a currency. Until it struggles with txs like btc, it will slowly gain market share. 
Merchants and vendors have started to adopt bch and until tx fees/times come down, this will continue.
I'm not shilling or spreading fud, it's just the way it is at the moment.
Bitcoin has the better long term road map but in the short term, it's going to be a rocky road
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:48:19
Got ya. It makes sense for overall long term stability, let's hope that LN continues to perform well on the testnet and can be rolled out!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:26:48

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:22:43
It's better than leaving it in a savings account and will/should give better returns.

I've heard that it's got a few security flaws, however it uses segwit, which is a massive bonus.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:23:39
The amount of of miners doesn't have much to do with it than the amount of txs in a block.
Bch's hash share is pretty low compared to btc

My gut is saying a slow bleed to below 12k over Christmas before rallying.
My gut has shit for brains though 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:52:54
Don't the tx fees go to the miners rather than the exchanges? Other than their own transaction fees that is

Mempool is all kinds of clogged. Been waiting for 48 hours as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:18:30
It's possible. 
 If it went down sharp enough it would probably shake the weak hands and further drop it before rebounding as people take advantage of the cheap coins
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:46:32
Yes and no.
While it is a good time to increase your coins, it is demoralizing seeing your investment shrink in fiat terms. If cryptocurrencies as a whole enter a bear market then it wouldn't be so bad but if other coins consistently outperform btc then it would be harder to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:15:36
You could get away with 180sat/byte. There's 2000 txs on and above that level so should  (theoretically) go through in the next couple of blocks
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:13:05
Fwiw I find it to be a good wallet. Clean interface and easy to use. 
As mobile wallets go, it's not too bad at all
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:14
It is a reasonable conclusion to come to.
I would say it's a combination of that and lots of new people getting in/people getting out and cashing in on the ATH.
I'm hoping the mempool clears. I'm still waiting on a couple of txs to get confirmed from yesterday 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:25:16
I’d rather have lightning when it’s ready, completely bug free and stable, rather than before. 
Would you risk your money using something that hasn’t been sufficiently tested? Would you risk the reputation and long term future of your crypto currency on an unfinished product?
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:00:26
Possibly.  A lot of the guys who got in at 10k plus haven't seen a proper dip or correction (lasting over a week anyway) so if one happened, it could shake all those loose hands.
On the other hand, there's all the hodlers and guys who want to get in cheap so any dip would be probably eaten up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:57:09
If there's no profit or realised gain then there's nothing to declare
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:28:04
Basically when the majority of users and exchanges use segwit and LN goes live, there will be a massive reduction in fees and congestion.
How long it will take for those things to happen could take anywhere from weeks to months.
Hopefully the backlog will clear soon though!
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:27:25
The only way I would say trade would be if I had insider information or could see in to the future.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:15:59
People just need to calm down and stop getting emotional / overreacting.
Cryptocurrencies are volatile.  until there is mass adoption, volatility will exist. While there is competition with other currencies, volatility will exist.
People have 3 options:
Sell 
If you have faith in Bitcoin, there is no reason to sell (unless you think you are a day trader). All the panicking achieves, is spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt.
Along with other reasons, bitcoin cash appears to be doing well because the community has faith in it and is consistently sticking to the party line.
To an outsider or someone new to bitcoin, they have the appearance of a currency that has quick, cheap txs and a community that has confidence and consensus.
Bch's scalability solution may only be a band aid and it's deeper issues obfuscated by the confidence of its supporters but the market is responding to that.
It is unlikely that it will last a long time before normal service resumes, but it doesn't mean that we should add to the FUD flying around the place
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:21:48
I'd be surprised if BTC goes down to $6k, and if it does, it will not be for long.
If I was a whale, of course I'd hedge.  The chance of another pump and dump would be worth the risk
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:46:35
The last 12 hours have been nice and a much needed relief but I don't think we are out of the woods yet.
I'll start to relax once the backlog of txs are cleared and fees drop.
If the past week has been down to shady actors,  I dont think a pump and dump would be the end of it
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:37:42
If drops and rises could be accurately predicted, there would be a lot more bitcoin millionaires.
Rule of thumb is the price will rise immediately after you've sold
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:01:01
Then there is also managing the perception of the sub and countering the narrative r/btc are trying to push.
They spend so much energy trying to make out the mods delete any dissenting opinions that we need to change the way we challenge those.
Many r/btc members are over there because the feel disenfranchised and that sub gives the appearance that they are welcoming, understanding and supportive. They give bch out to positive posts.
I'm not saying we need to bribe people like bch do.
We need to educate. We need to inform.
Shut down numpties. But shut them down with facts.
We need to show them that we are the better sub. That we are the better people.
So be better
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:39:55
I could live with that. Gives me a few months to buy more coin and a reasonable price
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:32:18
The amount of attention that btc has right now, I'd have to agree. Though if there was a big tx backlog and bch pump, I could see btc having a drop as some of the more recent investors will panic.
It's all good though, at least it would an opportunity to get some cheap coins
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:27:23
It depends on how much you want to make. 
It's highly likely that btc will increase by 10-25% over the next few months, but there is also the chance that we could enter a bear market.

*Shitty Maths disclaimer*
for it to be $1m per btc the market cap would be the same as the amount of dollars in circulation and easily accessed bank accounts.
If by 2020, a billion people used bitcoin, they would have to have an average of 22k invested in it.
It is possible.  
Dicks may get eaten

Aside from bcash, not at all. Bitcoin can’t rise all the time and it decreasing by 0.5% over the last 24 hours is no cause for concern.
I’m more concerned over the difficulty correction, as bcash has seemed to creep up on btc around that time
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:29:50

@_date: 2017-11-23 21:04:35
Well, it looks like the difficultly will reduce, with estimates ranging from -1% to -26%.  This should keep btc the most profitable coin to mine.
However, if bcash is pumped high enough and btc falls low enough then there is a chance that miner support could switch, causing a flooded mempool and high tx fees.
It won’t cause a death spiral, but could hit btc in the short term.
I feel that is highly unlikely. Exposure of btc is at an all time high, so many people are waiting for an opportunity to get in cheap that any significant drop in price will be immediately met with eager people ready to buy. 
On the other hand, with Black Friday approaching, I’m assuming that the more casual investor will be cashing out some of their coins to take advantage of the sales, which may drop the price a bit.
Tl:dr hodl, buy the dip

I get to screw your missus and get a beer? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:37:37
It depends on how much you want to make. 
It's highly likely that btc will increase by 10-25% over the next few months, but there is also the chance that we could enter a bear market.
If it was completely your own money, I'd say go for it. You know the risks, you know the potential reward.
But when it is loaned money? 
Would benyou able to pay it back should the worst happen and btc goes tits up?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:34:20
Essentially yes. People turned alts in btc in anticipation for the fork. That didn't happen so it looks like all that btc is getting turned back into the original altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:52:39
Definitely.  BCH's price appears to be stabilising but can see it dropping further once FUD takes effect for all the people waking up in the US.
I can see btc getting pumped while bch declines and the whole thing repeating.
I don't know enough about bch's hardfork to confidently comment on how that may effect things but as always, I'm expecting a lot of volatility on bch's part.  
As long as BTC is the most profitable coin to mine, it will be remain resilient. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:19:42
I should have included a shitty understanding of market caps in my disclaimer.
Every day is a school day, I guess
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:01:35
Price goes up along with tx time..
As long as btc is the most profitable to mine, the price and time should decrease.
I believe bch has a hard fork today / difficulty adjustment so there may be some volatility today.
So business as usual then
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:58:50
There is so much in the pipeline, in the meantime it would be good if segwit was used more to speed things up a bit. 
2nd layer and LN solutions could make bitcoin ubiquitous. The sooner they can be (safely) rolled out, the better.
As much as bch's block size increase is a band aid  fix at best, it does temporarily solve a problem.
Until bitcoin roll out something to stem the backlog, bitcoin is going to lose out to bch.
I don't want that to happen. I believe btc has the better roadmap and dev team. While I am optimistic about btc, there is a long way to go before it reaches a point where it doesn't need to be concerned about other cryptos
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:44:41

For now at least. 
Though you could argue that we are entering phase 2 of bch's attack depending on your viewpoint.
As long as the tx backlog gets cleared, mining support stays consistent and tx fees are manageable, bitcoin will stay strong.

I would appreciate the dip a hell of a lot more if I didn't buy before it started to drop.
Though to be fair, btc is still above what it was 24 hours ago.  
I am going to assume that there's a lot of new additions to the sub who haven't experienced their first dip. Do not worry. This happens all the time. 
Hodl. Buy the dip (If you can). There is no need to panic.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:10:08
I think/hope it would take a couple of years for the next 10x
It depends on how long it takes for 2nd and 3rd layer solutions to be implemented.
The world and bitcoin aren't quite ready for each other yet.
In the meantime, I would be more than happy for btc to slowly rise (and even the odd fork to spice things up)  and concentrate on improving the infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:45:31
People are tipping money on each other's posts in there.
Literally paying for positive things posted about bch.
It looks very suspect.

If you don't mind saying goodbye to your money, give day trading a go.
There is a reason why the majority preach hodl.

Hardly. I'm using bitcoin as a savings account for a deposit on a house.  While I doubt I will acquire enough to drive a lambo on the moon, the returns I  (should) get off it will make getting a sizeable deposit much easier to achieve.
Regardless of how much you put in, you still see the same gains as a percentage. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:07

I did exactly what I did last month and bought close to the ath before it dipped. I told myself I would never do that again, yet here I am.
Part of me is nervous. But I an tempted to buy the dip and offset my loss
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:23
Exactly. The run we've had all week has been crazy bullish. I'd be more concerned if there wasn't a correction 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:49

Allegedly nullc was behind the pro bch posts on r/bitcoin. 
Another day, another twist in the tale
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:40:00
The amount of bch that gets given to people posting positive things about bch is staggering. 
Either these people are paying for positive content because they truly believe what they do about bch and show their gratitude to others who feel the same
They know that bch is a weak crypto, that it's only way of success is the destruction of btc.  
The whole segwit2x event, the clogging of the mempool, the dump of btc and the pump and dump of bch, that was phase 1. It didn't work. Btc stayed resilient. It's market cap is big enough that it would take millions of btc to make an impact.
So they turn their attention to new  bitcoiners.
Ones that haven't been around for long, who have a surface understanding of bitcoin and it's history.
The type to be easily swayed by seeing people get tipped and want a peice of it? 
I mean, what's nicer than being accepted into a community and getting paid for it?
To me, it looks like bribery. For a sub that says bitcoin is in the pockets of bloodstream, to pay off posters to promote bch is just as suspect.
Maybe others see it that way and playing them. 
Either way, the situation is fucked 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:44:44

It felt like the minute I bought at the ath, btc decided to go for a little dip. 
Because I was stupidly late to the party, I don't mind this though I imagine a lot of other newcomers will be getting very nervous about the volatility. 
It'll be an interesting few weeks, hopefully I'll be able to build up my coins at a cheaper price 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:57
I am in a world of regret for not getting into crypto when I heard about it for the first, or seventh time.
Personally I'd just set aside $100 Or whatever you have spare a month to throw into btc and treat it like a savings account.

Bitcoin has made me think of saving in a completely different way
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:31:11
It depends how small a profit you are looking to make. By previous behaviour  (though is no guarantee of future performance), it is highly likely that the price will go up a few percent over a couple of days. So yes, technically you could be in and put of the market in a few days after making a small profit.
My main concern isn't the plan (as essentially we have all invested in bitcoin in the hope that it will continue to grow) but the financial risk that you put yourself in. As always you should always invest what you can afford and no one can accurately predict the markets. If the behaviour wasn't as expected and you didn't get a sufficient return within your tine constraints, would you still be financially sound? 
If so and everyone involved in this is ok and understands the risks, then it may be a risk worth taking.  But involving loans of any type to get into crypto is wrought with dangers and pitfalls.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:14:33
Maybe they are exploiting the pump and dump, maybe they are threatened by bch so set up a false flag event to rally the troops around, maybe nullc is secretly a big block lover, maybe blockstream is pulling all the strings, Maybe this is all satoshi's doing, maybe this is because my tin foil hat has fallen off my head 
In short, fuck knows.

Most trading platforms have a test net where you can trade for play money. That way you can learn the ropes without risking any money.
However, when there's real money on the table it's a lot harder to make objective/Good calls as emotion takes over.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:42:53
Definitely. The only way you'd lose out would be if bitcoin plummets in value. 
Trading opens yourself up to a lot of risk and reward. It isn't something that everybody is suited to and more often than not, inexperienced traders will lose money.

Confident because I don't see cryptocurrencies  disappearing. The cat is out of the bag now and it would take multiple black swan events to irreparably damage it to the point where they would cease to exist.
Out of all the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin has possibly the largest and strongest dev team. The underlying tech is solid with the shortcomings that it has are addressed with the developmental roadmap.
January has typically been a rough throughout the years, combined with hitting the (probably inflated) ath in December, FUD from all sides with futures, tether, SK 'banning' trading and others, it's been hard especially for those who got in around November.
Short term it's hard for me to be positive with the market being bearish for the last month with any recovery being hit by a dip taking us back to where we are ( though if I didn't make idiotic trades in late December I probably would have a different feeling on this) but support has remained around 10k which has been a good sign.
While I won't argue that investing in cryptos is basically gambling (especially some of the altcoins), the price is not randomly generated

Sell some as I go or is absolutely necessary. However should it reach a point where I don't have to cash out to fiat, then use it.
As far as price points etc go, my overall aim is to be financially secure, own my own house and have enough money that my basic needs are met. Work can then be something I do for the satisfaction, rather than the necessity.
However if it moons all the way to 1 mill a coin then I'd have to buy a lambo by law
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:22:37
it's almost as if adoption is increasing or something.
Unfortunately it's part and parcel of something gaining popularity however everyone was new to cryptocurrencies at some point and took their time to learn (or not in some cases).
As for shill accounts, well, those have existed for as long as there's been shitcoins to shill for.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:33:36
What a difference a day makes.  Give it a few weeks and they'll go back to saying that bitcoin is overvalued and a bubble waiting to pop
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:52:30
It took a while to get my head around that, especially during massive spikes in tx volume / fees where in my opinion at the time, a 'simple and modest' blocksize increase would temporarily fix things.
Only when I thought about the impact it would have, that it would ultimately slow down adoption of things like segwit by the big exchanges that it made more sense.
Batching and segwit appear to be keeping the mempool under control.  It'd be interesting to see how it copes under significantly more volume though
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:17:06
In a bull market you can quickly eat into your stack selling at the wrong time.

@_date: 2018-02-08 10:53:43
You talk as if there have not been anybody developing anything to address scaling.
Schnoor sigs and LN just to name 2 developments. LN has the potential to be revolutionary and process txs in ridiculously high volume for virtually nothing. It's been performing well on the testnet and from the last I heard, there were around 200 nodes on the mainnet. Things are looking promising and each development allows scaling to happen without sacrificing decentralisation.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:08:07
Scary isn't it? I think most people fail to realise that this is still early days of bitcoin and that a lot needs to happen before it can truly become a viable, decentralised currency.
Sacrificing centralisation/increasing blocksize  just so it can function a bit better now is incredibly short sighted.
Fortunately the improvements that have happened and still to come makes it an incredibly promising time!
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:44:12
Pretty much this.
Though I am getting tired of waking up every morning, checking the price and going "for fucks sake!" 
I'm more than confident that it'll recover. If anything I'm annoyed at myself for messing up a few trades in late December that prevented me from taking full advantage of this

I think the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140. A block is mined every 10 minutes and  every 4 years the reward for mining a block halves.
Difficulty of mining is changed to ensure that block discovery is as close to 10 minutes as possible 
Edit: spelling and factual error
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:33:51
It will probably still happen, however from a purely greedy point of view I’m hoping it’ll cause a massive short term drop in btc so I can make a bit of money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:33:00
Social conscience? The fact that unrestrained greed (in the case of the housing bubble) was the catalyst for bitcoin to be created?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:43:41
It works the other way as well. January felt like such a self FUDfilling prophecy that 8k was inevitable.

Fortunately the attack was short lived. The mods were quick to notice that their privileges had been revoked and a little bit of investigating made clear what happened.  A support request went out and was all resolved in about an hour. 
Don't think they know who was responsible, only that an old admin account had been compromised.
It's all sorted now and things seem to be back to normal
