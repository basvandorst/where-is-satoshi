If bitfinex lost 72m, and that was ~32% of their money, that would put total money held around 220m.  Was that much money moving every day or were some people just letting it sit in the exchange?
Reducing the amount of money held by an exchange reduces the incentive for an attack

Miners are some of the most heavily invested people in bitcoin.  They aren't just lazy or political or vindictive when they make their choices.
You seem to be cheerleading a position that you've arrived at based mostly on views of authority figures.  You may find a benefit from doing some objective research and it may either change your view or make you a more persuasive proponent.

Should the 2016 election have been about issues, ideas, qualifications?  Was it?  Fuck no.  Politics, corruption, echo chambers, mudslinging, us vs. them philosophies, and other bullshit got in the way.
You can argue that supporting BIPs should be purely a debate over code quality and their implications, but there are pretty obviously other factors people are considering in their support or opposition.
If communications are cut off from the btc side (15-20%), how would 95% be reached?  The consensus doesn't really care about motivations behind opposition

I'm not a miner, but from what I understand of the people who haven't but want to, 
* the mining pools often have to do extensive QA before importing changes like segwit to their custom client code
* Pools have their own internal and international politics to deal with.  Some have held votes, some are still discussing
* They may be waiting to see how much of the market agrees before they throw their hat in the ring.  How much of the surrounding infrastructure like exchanges would be alienated if it activated, what do the users think?
@_date: 2017-01-16 20:03:37
Nobody has ever said everyone supporting segwit is a paid shill, but this thread is filled with people claiming BU (20% of the network) are all paid shills.  Did you try to think of a real argument and come up short?

Nothing will ever have 100% consensus.  "Hitler was bad" doesn't even have 100% consensus.  I've seen people in this sub say any kind of change to bitcoin is inappropriate
When people bought into bitcoin, they bought into a protocol and ecosystem that will need to evolve to stay competitive and secure.  People realize they've hitched their horse to this wagon, but if it's going to change in a way they don't like then they can sell their BTC.  It's not like they are left behind with lost money

I believe you believe that, but I haven't seen it myself so far
BU is 10-20% of the network by any objective metrics, not social media or other unimportant metrics.  That would mean hash rate and node count.  But if you prefer social media metrics, the unique traffic to btc is 20% of r bitcoin

Right now it looks very unlikely that segwit will activate.  It's struggling around 30% and needs 95%.  The anti-segwit clients are between 5-20% already.  There's people opposing things just because it was made by the other side

Most transactions are not emergencies and fees don't scale that much.  I'd rather gain 10 cent fees from 200 transactions than 15 cent fees from 100 transactions

That's the closest I've seen a mod to acknowledging there might have been an issue with how things were handled, but then goes on to double down on part of the problem.
It's not the place of the mods to decide what clients or BIP will have consensus.  That is 100% decided by the users and the way the mods outlawed certain ideas as non-consensus or altcoins is a huge part of what split the community.  
If it is a "social attack" using sock puppet accounts, why not prove it by making the mod logs public like Until the logs are publicized and the altcoin rule is made reasonable again, the moderation here doesn't have a leg to stand on in my opinion.

Bitcoin has a strong first-to-market advantage, but it needs updates, bugfixes, features like any other software.  If changes can't happen, a competing currency will eventually take over.  If changes are made without consensus, it will signal insecurity, uncertainty, and the userbase will go elsewhere.

Is there anything being done on the side of things to bridge the gap?  Moderation or downvotes makes both subs echo chambers and it really worries me the way this issue has divided people.

Additionally, the competing dev team doesn't need to control the most popular client to be successful.  They can be used by people to support certain ideas or stances.

A very significant amount of transactions happen off the blockchain, in the ledgers of exchanges.  I'd expect this to increase with a credit card type system

If I use a 3rd part wallet like electrum, how do I know my wallet will always work with the network?  What if the electrum nodes move on, a critical vulnerability is discovered and the rest of the network won't talk to electrum, or some other scenario?   Is my wallet.dat good on other wallets?

Where can I request support on Bitcoin core -Windows x64?
My client has stopped updated despite 14+ connections and I have to move the coins to a wallet that is more reliable

All risk and reward is already factored into the market value.  The price would indicate a low level of confidence right now.

Virtu USA has 10% off, but they have never actually had the items in stock like their website shows

There will never be a perfectly secured system, and the good news is, it doesn't have to be.  It just has to be better than the current one.  
When you consider attack vectors on bitcoin, it's important to use the current system as a reference.  Keyloggers, MITM, bad passwords, and many others apply to online banking and credit cards.  
They big difference is the insured losses with USD, but I'm sure those are actually just socialized losses that we all pay for somehow.

so 600w would provide about half that much heat for a single room.  If he's paying 300/month in gas, he's got a lot of rooms to heat

This was a concept a few years ago with general cloud computing.  Someone would pay you to run a server in your home during winter in whatever hemisphere you're in
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:47:38
I don't think at this stage it is.  People don't understand bitcoin yet and will think of it as hacker money
@_date: 2016-10-12 22:22:38
kapatris's fake update scenario is a client or LAN attack, which is more common than electrum's website being breached to this degree.  
If you wanted to verify electrum's hashes are authentic, they could sign the message with their PGP key
@_date: 2016-10-06 19:04:21
Yeah I don't think the project ever got off the ground.  A few of those issues were addressed with a certain level of redundancy and replication, but $$$ is the most important factor.
I do think there is some merit to the idea of datacenters or other hosting in certain hemispheres/climates, but I'm not an expert
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:37:29
It's a brand new currency.  Anyone holding bitcoin is an early adopter.  There's no comparison to be made at this stage and certainly no basis for predicting future distribution
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:03:34
You can go to electrum's website for the official download and checksum hash

I know this is technically true, but obscenely unlikely.
Is there any situation where bitcoin users/nodes/miners would decide to do this? (short of hostile takeover)
@_date: 2015-03-28 16:50:47
Extremely technically yes, in the same way everyone could accidentally drop their gold in volcanos at the same time.  
Even if this happened, an extreme shortage of bitcoin could be handled by making bitcoins divisible by more than 8 places
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:03:11
Fees are only optional insofar as miners are willing to accept your transactions.  During high volume, you could be waiting several minutes for your transaction to hit the blockchain.  This achieves a balance between fees and miner's costs
Governments and businesses will have to weight some very different cost/benefits from fiat, but we'll just have to see what they decide.  Adoption certainly hasn't been unfavorable so far.  In the end, it will most likely be the people's demand that decides whether bitcoin stays or goes.
Volatility happens with every currency, let alone one that is less than a decade old.  You can't define a value and say it rises $5/day.  Supply and demand runs every currency in the end.
Also consider than an inflationary currency is constantly losing value.

I was running a full node, but it stopped syncronizing despite 8 active connections and I'm not sure how to fix it.  I've had a lot of problems with bitcoin core stabilty in general, so I'm going to find a guide to secure my coins elsewhere.
Even when I did run a working node with all ports forwarded, I never got more than 13 connections and they hardly used any bandwidth

There are some valid concerns and discussion to be had about bitcoin, but holy shit do they make it hard look at their perspective 
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:50:08
There can be bailouts, they just can't do it by inflating the currency.  Our taxes would be raised and everyone could see exactly how much it costs them
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:43:23
Do you have more than 8 connections?  If not, you're just leeching, not seeding
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:59:15
Is it possible to run a Tor or bitcoin node through a VPN connection?
