Both  
Electrum can open multiple wallets  
You will find some backwards exchanges and other payers can not support SegWit addresses, so you will need a legacy wallet to receive those payments  
Use SegWit for your main wallet  
When you get occasional payments to legacy addresses, send them to your SegWit address

"would have spelled"  
You're shouting to the world "Look at me, I'm illiterate"  
OK, so LN has problems and is not a Bitcoin scaling solution  


No, really they don't. Even if they did, offline transactions are not a scaling solution  
Try harder

The only fool is the author of this post, identifying obvious flaws in Bitcoin and LN, and proposing that meshnets are a solution  
Meshnets are interesting in their context, but completely irrelevant to the criticism of LN and other Bitcoin bike sheds

Can I pay the organisers directly in Bitcoin and avoid the booking fee?

Thank you  
CoinSpot fees look much friendlier than IndependentReserve and BTCMarkets  
  
  
  
IR ...  
*    Direct deposit $0.99 (free for deposits over $100)  
*    POLi $3.30  
*    PayID $2.50  
*    No BPAY  
*    Trading fee 0.5% (varies from 0.05% to 0.5% depending on 30-day trading volume)  
*    Bitcoin withdrawal 0.0003  
BTCM ...  
*    No direct deposit  
*    No POLi  
*    PayID Free  
*    BPAY Free  
*    Trading fee (crypto/crypto pairs) 0.22%  
*    Trading fee (crypto/fiat pairs) 0.8% (varies from 0.1% to 0.85% depending on 30 day trading volume)  
*    Bitcoin withdrawal 0.0003  
CoinSpot ...  
*    No direct deposit  
*    POLi Free  
*    PayID Free  
*    BPAY 0.9%  
*    Cash 2.5% - this appears to be cash over the counter at newsagents and convenience stores, using the Blueshyft payment system  
*    Trading fee 0.1%  
*    Bitcoin withdrawal - miner fees only  
All three exchanges have zero fee for withdrawing AUD fiat  
The trading fees refer to on market trading. CoinSpot also has an immediate buy (off market) option for a 1% fee  
PayID and POLi are instant  
BPAY and direct deposit are 1-3 days, typically next business day  
PayID (I think) is available at all Australian banks  
POLi is not available at many of the smaller banks

There are none. The Austrac Act was modified to require all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency sellers to register with Austrac, and keep full records of all customers' identity. You might be able to use Bisq anonymously. Otherwise, buy and sell among friends, or at Bitcoin meetups  
For lowest fees, use Independent Reserve, ID proof is mandatory

If you send 1000 bucks, the fee will only be 0.2%
