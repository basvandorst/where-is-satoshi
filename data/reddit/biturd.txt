Let’s call 1 bit a credit..... I would love some 5th element style verbiage 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:17:19
who gives a shit if you can buy games with it.....Is that seriously something we need censorship resistance to buy.....These type of use cases can wait until we implement scaling in a safe and effective sustainable way.  You can use bitcoin right now for anything you deem necessary enough to warrant its use.

Lol at anyone who believes this nonsense.  If there ever was a guy smart enough to deflect questions of his own wealth...that man is Andreas.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:27
several months of patient HODLing .... :facepalm:

The whole point is that it does not matter what Ver wants.....He makes no sense...is technically incompetent.. and is just distracting us all from what matters....Jihan and the miners. 
They want high fees in addition to the block reward (which will decrease by design over time).  Balancing the competing priorities of miners and users is what we should be talking about....not BU...not Ver
Thats the only path forward to Segwit....Or we can just wait for the price to fall enough to force their hands....though that not an ideal solution.

Only if they mine the BTC chain.  But bitcoin.com was supposed to be in opposition to anything Core and thus segwit.  Once the chain split occurred I would have expected them to follow their promises and move all hashing over to BCH.

Once 141 locks in, segwit is locked in and there is not much that cn be done to stop it. As far as 2x, im very doubtful people will migrate away from Core software so it will just create another silly Bcash fork if it happens.

Only problem is the tax implications...for those of us that dont want to run south of that stuff. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:27:46
I would like to buy that argument.  But if he holds 100k bitcoin and decides to keep them, he can manipulate the market no matter how high and how widely adopted it becomes.  This is the thing im trying to understand.  Where does this end and how to we deal with such large concentrations of the coin in the hands of bad actors?  No question a 20% swing due to a pump spooks investors and those looking to Bitcoin as a safe haven.  I have always believed that we are not yet in steady state so large swings are expected. However, this issue wont go away in steady state if Ver controls so many coins as they will increase with the price of Bitcoin leaving him with the same amount of sway.

Listening to this really makes me think that Ver + Jihan = CIA.........  
Edit: Typo

I dont think you could classify this as a gift since its not from a person or relative.  Im not a tax expert, but I suspect the Gov (US) would likely try to treat this as a dividend.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:59:27
And tried to market it as a competitor.... somehow better

The thesis that inflation drives consumption is silly. There is near frictionless transactions between stocks and cash and a nominal long term growth rate of 9%. Yet, people still seem willing to spend cash for goods.  Though I'm not sure Bitcoin itself needs to act as a currency in order to provide value. The simple fact that it is not centrally controlled and is censorship resistance makes it the best long term store of value in existence.  That is a paradigm shift in finance if my opinion.  As a store of value, it's really hard to say with any certainty what the terminal value would be.

Well I can tell you that you have cost me the equivalent of hundreds of dollar of my time.  If this was a credit card I would cancel your payment.  You may have skipped that by forcing me to use bitcoin to buy, but reducing service to your customers since you no longer have the liability of chargebacks is a terrible business strategy.  I am moving to ledger and suggesting that all my friends and family do the same.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:20:22
Yea but who should bare the cost for that...the customer or the seller.  Sending a device to a PO box in Europe is expensive from the US.  If they need the device back for proof, they should arrange shipping or send me a second device with return shipping.  They can even collect my credit card to charge me in the event i dont send it back.  However, this attitude that the customer is wrong until proven otherwise is not how retail works here in the US.  
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:16:22
I tried 3 computers and 2 cable.  Remember...I bought two and the other one works as expected.  Im pretty sure the one is defective.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:49:10
I cant mail it back for that amount....I tried.  No other startup acts the way you do. The fact that you only accept bitcoin "allows" you to dictate your process on me.  Otherwise i would simply cancel the payment and im 100% sure the credit company would side with me.  You made me pay for a device and never delivered one that worked.  Now you expect me to waste my time figuring out how to send it to you for a very low amount only to likely have you refuse to refund me the shipping anyways. Why should the burdon be on me to make this right....Your the ones that sent a defective device. I never received what i paid for. Im not asking for special treatment...just the product I pad you for months ago in working working condition. If you want the broken one back....send me return shipping il gladly use that.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:23:19
I did send the request to your support and am waiting for an answer.  The big disconnect here is how much effort you expect your customer to go through when you guys make a mistake.  Now I understand you didnt mean to send me a defective device....however...you did.  So the effort to make it right should be on your side...not mine. 
And i object to the the statement that you CANT fix this unless i ship the device back to you at my own cost.  You can easily make it better.  Send me a working device.  If you really want this broken one back...include return shipping.  Fixed...burdon removed from customer and placed where it belongs...on the seller.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:23:43
This was fixed (Trezor came back with an acceptable solution).  so i would like to let the community know that they did make it right.
