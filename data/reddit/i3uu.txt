This is very sad news man I'm sorry to hear this :(
Usually the coins were stored in a wallet.dat file if im not mistaken.  Maybe run a search for any filetype with .dat and filename of wallet?
Someone else smarter here could probably help you more.

Ask them to go to the bank and demand their value of Dollar in gold nuggets

In the USA, its a pretty damn good site.  Other than the initial fee for buying coins with a Credit card or whatever its probably the cheapest to use.  Gdax.com also works with it so you can buy/sell/trade without any fees.  HMU if you need help

Unfortunately I agree with this. It looks great!.. but it's hard to make out what it is. It's too subtle for 'mainstream' people to adapt to

Its about to dip.. i just hope its not too far

I was sad because I had no more wiggle room to buy when it hit 13.3 :(~~~~

You made money. If you held the Bitcoin you would have lost $500 but since you traded it, you now have $2000 in Bitcoin or 4 Bitcoin according to your analogy.

Id suggest reading more about bitcoin and how it works before worrying.  It'll pass, it just takes time, especially with as much traction it has gained in the past few weeks

I was so sad when it dropped to 13,500 last night.. not because it dipped, but because I told myself I wouldn't put any more money in Bitcoin (so I don't overextend) . I knew it would go back up, but I couldn't find the strength to deposit more from my bank. See y'all around 100k!

I had buys at 5.6k and 5.8k. I was so sad to wake up and see none of them filled :(

That poor dude. Watched it and was confused as to why no penalty flag was thrown. Either way great game
