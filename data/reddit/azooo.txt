Its Fiat money. You take your bitcoins sell them for EUR and use that cash to pay 4 food

Thanks for doing this - I really appreciate it. 
Looking back - do you think he had a legit plan that turned bad or that it was a con scheme from the begining?
If the former, what do you think is the most likely reason for such a turnout of events?

I am not sure about your level of expertise. But the second natural step from here would be to learn about wallets and send the BTC to an address whose keys you fully control. In case you did not do that already.

If you plan to store it for many years, then starting to buy right now might not be a bad idea. As someone mentions it might be wise to buy regularly in weekly/monthly chunks, depending on your financial situation. It is crucial that you move the purchased BTC to a private wallet under your control.
I'd suggest buying on Bitstamp since they are extremely reliable and don't have any withdrawal fees, which is useful if you plan to buy in small amounts and transfer them to your private wallet.

Have to agree, they were by far the best support I've ever witnessed  on any of the exchanges I've used so far.

Many people don't really understand the WHY. What the real problem actually is and what is the best solution to it.
I generally tend to disregard anybody saying "XYZ is faster than bitcoin and had many more features". That is an immediate tell that the guy has no idea what he is talking about.
If speed was in any way relevant then one could use PayPal or create some other coin tracked by a centralized database. 
The majority seem to be thinking that the notion of digital token/currency is revolutionary, but in fact we could have that even in the early days of the internet. Similarly, people right now seem to be hyped by blockchain solutions, not realizing we had databases since at least 1970.

How did you manage to lose 15% on an asset that is up ~15% YTD?

Unlike people here saying, the main purpose of Bakkt is not to offer Bitcoin custody. Rather, it is to offer so called futures contracts with **physical delivery** of Bticoin. Physical delivery requires custody but is more of a side product to what they are aiming for.
How is Bakkt supposed to work? A physically delivered Bitcoin futures contract is an agreement to be able to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specified price sometime in the future.
Example. You think the price of BTC is going to go higher in the next 6 months. Through BAKKT you buy a contract that allows you to buy 1 BTC for $6000, within the next 6 months. At some point the price skyrockets to $10000 and you can then claim your BTC, paying $6000 for it. You can think of similar examples in case you're feeling bearish about BTC.
How is that different from what CBOE/CME offers? Their contracts are cash settled so instead of receiving actual BTC you are entitled to the cash equivalent of the BTC price. Some argue that such  contracts (cash settled) encourage excess speculation, since nobody really cares to sell/hold the underlying asset.
Hence the aim of BAKKT is to offer a trusted framework for actual price discovery for BTC

You do need to download it, but it does not have to be stored, meaning that the data will be discarded as you go and only limited disk usage will occur thought the download.

You can but its easier to get bitcoin by buying it. The same way it would not make much sense for you to dig for gold or diamonds at this point in time.

I am trying to compile a list of all cases where somebody got their bitcoin lost/stolen/hacked or frozen by the exchange or government itself. Any link to stories/comments is welcome.

It seems to me that this is a framework that alows you to create your own coins/tokens pretty much as on ETH, only that they are tied to the Bitcoin blockchain.
The key of this is that it allows for many features tied to the way you create  (finite supply, dynamic supply ..) and transact with them (someone mentions privacy options)
The creation/usage of tokens is of course not new,  the edge here is that its well designed and robust. I would assume that stuff coming from blockstream is high quality software both in terms of design and implementation.

In order to tell you what the best way to enter for you is, we need to know your location. In general I'd suggest using Bitstamp since it allows free withdrawals which is perfect for someone making small purchases (you don't want to pay 0.0005BTC fee for a 0.001BTC purchase for example)
Notice the emphasis on withdrawal. It is crucial that you withdraw coins to a wallet that you have full control of. This part is tricky and it requires some thought. Will you use a hardware wallet, mobile wallet? Which one? How will you secure it? In order to benefit the most from owning BTC and not get hacked it makes sense to spend some time answering the above questions. 
PM me if you need more specific guidance about these topics.

I'd also recommend people to really make sure they are buying their hardware wallets from the \*original\* reseller as there has been instances of compromised devices. I'd recommend trezor since their wallet software is open source and thus more in spirit with the whole community as well as more transparent in its security.
For those more adventurous I'd also recommend looking into the glacier protocol, which is something that is recommended by Trace Mayer too [

Its gonna be a stresstest for exchanges and bitcoin too. We can't expect bitcoin to be taken seriously if we need to coordinate when to use it.

Good time to learn about the glacier protocol -

I'd use bitstamp, their buy/sell fee is 0.25%. For this price you get to have free withdrawals and a professional service that proved to be extremely resilient over the years. Many of the other exchanges are either shady or malicious in one way or another. 
Make sure you immediately withdraw any BTC you purchase to your own wallet.
As far as learning what kind of knowledge are you looking for?
I'd suggest looking at Lopp's  for general stuff as well as Trace Mayer's 
Finally, if you want to learn about the trading aspect I'd only look at Tone Vays  as well as his daily youtube podcasts. All else related to price prediction is most likely noise.
If you also need good follows for Twitter, let me know.

The whole idea of bitcoin is that you hold the bitcoin yourself everything else is not your bitcoin really. So people will discourage you from keeping bitcoins on blockchain, coinbase or any other online service really.
Depending on your willingness to learn I'd recommend using a hardware wallet, specifically Trezor. If you are a bit more tech savvy you might look into Bitcoin core (bitcoincore.org). The later would cost you 0 to use, but you need to know how to handle the keys securely yourself.
