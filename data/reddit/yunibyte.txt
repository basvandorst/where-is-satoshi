Friendships only last if there’s reciprocity. If you’ve enjoyed the benefits of his gift, and you are true friends, you would want to reciprocate somehow.  Bitcoin could go down to zero tomorrow (though I don’t believe it’s likely it’s a possibility.) Would that scenario change anything you do?

Wouldn’t it be noticeable if you follow the wallet back to its source?

There are some people who believe that AI created bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:03:41
I guess theoretically, if an even more powerful AI than the one that created bitcoin was created. But I believe the computing and blockchain power behind bitcoin right now is so massive it probably wouldn’t happen in our generation. Governments and banks and general people are still scrambling to even understand the crypto currency ecosystem. It’ll take an equally enormous amount of computing and calculating power to crack the codes and algorithms behind bitcoin so as long as coins remain in the process of mining and the blockchain network is expanding, it’s the reigning AI of the century. But I’m not like an expert or anything so that’s just my personal gut feeling.

There’s 18.1 million coins mined and 1.1 million subscribed in this subreddit. Therefore it weighs about 15 nerd souls per coin. As it becomes more valuable, the density of souls will go down, such is the law of satosics.

Would make sense why he knows so much about bitcoin if he and Kleinman back engineered everything and got stuck in the rabbit hole. Wright probably can’t access the hard-drive because he don’t know the keys to the coins. But he could probably hack away at the metadata and guess what’s in there.
Craig Wright is a scammer out trying to sue the shit out of everyone—has no altruistic marks in his persona, thinks he’s the smartest dbag in the world, says he got his pseudonym from Pokémon references because he had to make up how he made up his name. Maybe he impersonated Satoshi for a while and now really believes in his own shit, but it’s doubtful I can see him giving two minutes to some handicapped guys in wheelchairs and have the commonality to work for/with them back and forth coding something that had never been done before.
James Bilal is a number worshipping geek mystic who probably even ran his crazy Chaldean number theory to see if he should get married. Who sounds more likely as a candidate to be the originator of a whole currency system that is only backed up by math? Someone who studied cryptography for the government, or someone who just LIVES in a humble life of total encryption, out of self paranoia and over excessive caution to the point where he loses most of his audiences with short attention spans in the numerical gibberish trying to get his point across.

Maybe the plan is to redistribute them to the masses in part two? So much of bitcoin has become locked up by institutional banking, it’s hard for the average person to buy/mine and moreover use it to purchase anything. If the point of bitcoin was to become a global currency with low/no transaction fees it’s a failure as of now.

Do you imagine the real Satoshi to look like a frat brother or something?
I’m personally not completely giving up on my theory that Satoshi is an AI generated program created to save humanity and when the final bitcoin algorithm is solved singularity happens and either we go Skynet or Cylon.

To be fair I would not expect the inventor of bitcoin to be completely sane anyway
@_date: 2019-08-22 23:10:32
I was told some of his hotels have accepted bitcoins in the past so maybe by proxy
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:11:42
I mean when the final coin is mined. Sorry, I’m not a techie, just a hobbydabbler.

Seems like the banker mentioned and the bank are real. Anyone else find it interesting he and his wife had a daughter Maha Abedi? I can’t find really seem to find anything online about her and who says Satoshi has to be a man? 
If anything, a woman would totally write all this stuff, with this kind of voice. It’s not unusual for people to assume I’m a guy in certain forums just because it’s male dominated.

Thanks for the advice and feedback! I funded it with .007btc and moved it around on their exchange. I’m actually up... not sure if I just got lucky but I love how the charts let you compare different coins against bitcoin as well as the dollar at the same time. Coinbase really fleeces you IMO, moving coins around there took any gains I made in the spread. 
I guess I was just wondering how it compares to nexus, seems like a similar concept with the crypto backed card.

Got my bets on the potato, kinda scared what tabula rasa means for bitcoin though. Should I pull the funds on robinhood out? Lol
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:35:46
All I see is verification that he’s working around the UK, proving/reinforcing theories that Satoshi was/is a British speaker all along. Not sure what you’re asking help for at the moment. Lol

Wouldn’t be surprised if the tech guys took a military encrypted grade hard drive from a Muslim on national security worries and sent it to the M16 for further analysis and they sent it to some certain computer forensics in Australia for help.

Venmo probably props up liquidity for PayPal. I have more money on Venmo than my bank account sometimes. This week for example.

Agreed, people are saying it’s not Satoshi’s style, but the white paper was a professional technical paper with footnotes and references. This is more like a blog write up, therefore a much different tone.
People are nitpicking things that spellcheck and autocorrect probably had a hand in. Considering how dramatically sudden Satoshi left the bitcoin community, is it such a stretch they wouldn’t melodramatically return?
Also interesting is a few weeks ago I commented on a thread of someone from Indonesia/India asking for advice on 150btc their “geek” friend gifted them years ago, seems like the miner friend didn’t end up hodling btc due to life circumstances and was trying to guilt some of it back from OP. People were calling it a shitpost, but another reddit user commented “I am that friend, and I will make your life miserable” or something to that extent. His whole account has since been deleted but when I checked his posts history at the time they seemed legit very knowledgeable about blockchain and the technology.
My take from that post thread is that massive amounts of bitcoin floating around that geographical area might not be far fetched, if this Satoshi really is Indonesian, would make sense they shared some info with people around them without them realizing the impact it was having globally.

Well if fiat dollars are based off of nothing and we’re valuing bitcoin with dollars, then yeah, nothing of nothing still equals nothing. Money is an illusion, the only currency that matters is how socially and morally bankrupt you are to each other. Only a matter of time before the USA goes Venezuela and we’ll all be using the yuan for global currency.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:47:28
I would say it’s based on computational and technological value; only highly advanced economies can support the infrastructure needed to maintain bitcoin—coders who can understand the nuances of mining, securing the coins, maintaining the ledgers and infrastructure that supplies secure electricity and internet.
The more bitcoin grows in value and quantity correlates with how much the population invests in education and divests from national interests to global ones.
