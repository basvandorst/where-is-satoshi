LOL Downvote and WRONG! 
Cool! 
[What I said is exactly how it worked](
What the fuck am I doing linking sources, your just gonna go back to watching fox news and being stupid. OH well... nothing I can do to make a idiot read.
I guess just do all of us a favor and please don't breed! 
P.S.  How the hell can you be in crypto and support Trump... there is no way he stays in power and any of this stays legal....MAGAAAAAAAA!

Everyone keeps talking about LN to solve transaction problems and the real solution is SegWit adoption THEN Atomic swaps and Lightning Network. Everyone should be demanding exchanges, mining pools or anywhere else to implement SegWit.

Yeah in America we used to have one of those sites....... Trump Took it down.

I am fairly certain the White House responded to every petition that reached 100k signatures in 30 days. It wasn't normally Obama responding and it didn't need to be.
Good think you have no idea about how the site worked and still made negative assertions about Obama using it! MAGAAAAAAAAAAA!
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:09:47
100k signatures in 30 days is was the rule that and my bad lets say "almost every petition" some were not answered for legal or other reasons.
Not answering a few vs answering nothing and shutting it down is very different. 
It's been 6 hours... I bet your in bed with a Big mac like your Favorite president.

It's important that they perform maintenance so people don't keep bugging Trump about his taxes via petitions at the top of the page because obviously it's fake news caused by the liberal media and those petitions were all started by Hilary Clinton and her team of un-American saboteurs unlike all the real support for the removal of net neutrality.
Trump has the best taxes and he did them perfectly no ones needs to check them because as a business man who makes the best deal's Trump knows how to do his taxes the best so obviously there is no need to check them because there is no collusion.
Now if you all will excuse me I need to slam my car door on my head a few times....MAGA!

What exactly are they improving about the site? and Why take it down for over a month to do it?
Most of the time when you upgrade a web site you keep the main site up then you create what is basically a copy of the site and you build the new site based on the copy and test it then you just release the new site. 
Taking down a web site for a month to improve it makes very little sense unless the underlying database (or some other more complex component) is screwed and you have to rebuild it....that said a database full of petitions isn't really a terribly hard thing to rebuild and shouldn't take a month (more like a weekend).
I cannot conceive of a single thing that site would need to be taken down for a month to improve upon or fix. Someone with more development experience than myself might be able to change my mind but I think the answer is they took it down so Trump didn't have to be worried by it while he eats Big Macs in bed.
As for me lying no..... the excuse of upgrades is just a very flimsy one.

lol My experience is building a few websites, and the petitions site seems like something I might be able to make. I like mentioning the Trump eating Big Macs thing because it cracks me up... remove that sentence and I am being honest. 
You saying "ohhh so your not a professional web developer currently and are on top of all the latest stuff about building webpages..... FUDDDDD"
What my mediocre level of web developing ability is telling me is that taking down a site for a month to upgrade it makes no sense. When you have a site and you are going to upgrade it you build the upgrade on a "test net" and then you release it after it's done [just like crypto currencies do](
I want to make punchy snarky list too so here:
1. Your ability to judge the development experience of others is limited by your own lack of development experience (I will have you know I ROCK C++.... 98 lol....ughhh I am old)
2. You don't like picturing Trump eating Big Macs in bed...which is sad because it's hilarious

Video should have started or ended with 2-3 black frames with a slight fade in or something. The way the video is cut and the thumbnail makes it look like the payment locked the article.

Annnnnnnd all the replies are bots doing a ETH giveaway scam....
Is it seriously that hard to create algorithms to detect and get rid of that crap?

They had a 7000 point karma post, I though it was odd for a bot. I did think that it might have been an account created by an advertiser for that company so instead of calling it a bot I went ahead and shat on their pricing. 
Although if they create bots then have each bot make posts till one of them gets a post with over 1000 karma then uses that post legitimize the bot and make it seem real that is a fairly good idea.

If you have Xfinity internet and you are using their modem and router do your self a favor and buy your own cable modem and router. Comcast charges you a rental fee each month for using their crappy equipment which makes the modem and router pay for themselves after less than a year normally. I have seen rental fees of $20 a month for the standard combo modem router they use and a decent router will run you $70-$100 and a solid cable modem about $40-$70. (currently using a [Netgear AC1750 router]( and a [Netgear CM500 cable modem](
Xfinity routers also have this built in connection sharing feature for your cable modem. They basically take the bandwidth you are paying them for to share with other xfinity customers that happen to be in the area.

Funny billboard for a mining company with terrible pricing!
Only $869.00 for 30 MH/s of Etherium! At only twice the cost of a GTX 1070...
....people need to stop linking that image, that company sucks and it's advertising for them.
