Except it is free of human error in a completely different, irreversible when compared to fiat. I love crypto but I wish people would quit this facade that this is a FIAT killer. Bitcoin sparked the revolution, but it wont be the replacement. 
When someone skimmed my debit card and waited months until it was Christmas Eve to withdraw all of my money to buy time on investigation, I had all of my money restored the morning after Christmas. 
When someone fat fingers an address, mis prints a QR code, incorrectly sets up a wallet, or makes a computer input based mistake, due to bitcoin/crypto being a radically different type of technology, that money is GONE. Without the ability to restored. It is deleted. Who is going to be the person making that mistake? An elderly woman moving her net worth to a hardware wallet? A person who accidentally hit delete? A malicious hacker who encrypts your drive? A hurricane that takes out your entire home? A well secured cloud account but operated by a novice in security? 
This is why being your own bank sucks so bad. And it's the principal of crypto. I hear people copy+paste the same shit ever time: "If you don't own your keys, you don't own your wallet". Well since brain wallets are the LEAST secure kind, you're likely going to use a generated one with your software of choice. Where do you store that key? They say that you only have a real backup when you have 3 backups - Your primary, a second backup on a different volume, and an off-site backup. That's three potential points of attacks. The second volume and primary storage in your home will be destroyed if your computer is destroyed if involved in an event that causes damage (flooding, sprinklers, fire, ect). The one in the cloud could be compromised at any point. Social engineering has shown to be able to penetrate even the highest of security...and when the prize is currency that is both untraceable (depending on your knowledge in btc mixing and other means of laundering) and unrecoverable. Sure you can keep your wallet in a bank security box, but you'll still need some kind of access to have spending money, unless you do a Cold wallet/hot wallet system, but then you have to literally GO TO THE BANK to transfer money to yourself. Yuck. Also big issue if you're in a pinch on a weekend or holiday or anytime past 5pm. 
This is why I cannot sell people on Bitcoin. Because the only way I get them into bitcoin is if I inadvertently become their IT guy. But instead, this time, it's a lot of shit at stake. And when something goes wrong, the victim will always take the brunt of the pain. My bank restored my money and the thief ended up getting caught, but he had already spent a lot of the money and I absolutely doubt the full amount will be recovered. 
Say they track down the person who steals your bitcoins, but he spent 50% of them. Actually, don't imagine a hypothetical - look at fucking Mt.Gox. Yeah, imagine your life savings was in Mt.Gox...it's taking a while to get that money back, isn't it? And I hear what you're thinking already: DONT STORE ON AN EXCHANGE/ONLINE. Yeah, but even with your backups, you're at risk for theft. What if the offline, hidden harddrive is found and stolen in a burglary? Shit! Better get all those coins moved - but the thief stole your computer and has both backups. Oh shit, no big deal. You borrow a friends computer and log in to your SuperSecure 2.0 Crypto Safe CLOUD Storage Inc. account...but you use a password manager and you're having trouble remembering the master password. Shit. How many more hurdles do you need to overcome to get to that wallet before the thieves do? **That's the problem. If you fail to be quick, you could lose everything in what would otherwise be a small hit to your net worth.**
I love bitcoin, I love certain parts of the community and this technological shift is incredible to be living through...but I wish people would start looking at Bitcoin's actual strengths instead of idolizing it into something it's not capable or ready to be yet. To a noob, this quote paints a different picture of crypto compared to what the vets see. Anyone remember the Eth glitch that wiped out 10s of millions of dollars from the network? Anyone remember the 51% scares? These things are too volatile, complicated, and unnecessary to the average person. The thing is, crypto - from the perspective of a "Fiat replacer" offers absolutely nothing in terms of an improvement to the laymen that isn't immediately canceled out by the introduction of new problems. And that is a lot of risk for the vast majority of people who can't afford to lose any money. And these problems persist regardless of volatility in price or development of btc code. It is an inherent consequence from the nature of decentralized currencies. 
In the future, when the dust has settled, crypto currencies will have their place in our world - as enterprise grade solutions for transferring money or anything that can be piggybacked into a timechain/blockchain/DAG based ledger. But FIAT will continue to rule because people cannot be expected to not make mistakes. For all the bad that FIAT causes through mass printing and being government controlled, it certainly has backup plans for our inevitable mistakes, hacks, thefts, and attacks.
Fuck this quote. Long live bitcoin. Hail hydra. Send more vegetables to space and someone please help me get this fucking cat out of my air ducts, I cannot stand the sound of it's nails on the metal any longer.
**EDIT:** Please read my responses to some of the commenters below to see if I've already addressed a critique on my post. I'm ecstatic to have a conversation about this but don't want to copy+paste responses on similar posts in an effort to avoid karma farming and wasting time.
**EDIT2:** Hey just to reiterate, I'm not looking to start a fight with anyone. Again (though I really shouldn't have to say this at all) I am a BTC supporter. I'm just pointing out a few problems I've noticed outside the magical thinking of a cryptocurrency based economy. That's all. Would appreciate it if no one took this too personally. Got a few weird interactions after making this post last night so I figured it's worth mentioning. Full disclosure; I sold the majority of my stake in BTC after I was away on a job without internet access for a few months during the big 20k blunder. When I had free time, day trading was great, but after that crash, I couldn't risk having any reasonable amount of money in a high risk/hard to access setup, which to this day is the only safe way to hold BTCs. 
If Crypto can only succeed with 3rd party platforms/companies such as insurance or banks...then it isn't decentralized. If it isn't decentralized, then what? Isn't that one of the main selling points? Would love to be proven wrong with the issues I've raised, but I think it will take a lot of time for these issues to be fixed from a codebase point of view. 
That means that the valuation of BTC is based on an unfinished product. Which means if these issues I've raised are fundamental limitations (or features, depending on the type of user), then the valuation of BTC can be expected to crash...hard.

“I’m sorry that discussing the complex economic theory of introducing a new, non-government backed, decentralized currency cannot be shortened to a paragraph.” 
How’s that? This is why bitcoin will stagger in its growth - users that only want one paragraph/image macros that immediately support their POV. What an immature way of looking at this.

How exactly is what I said part of a nirvana fallacy? I'm not saying because bitcoin is not perfect that it isn't good. I'm saying that in the ways Bitcoin is good, it doesn't make up for the ways it is not. I then say in another reply that Banks are not necessarily good, but they make up for their badness with good outcomes for normal, everyday people in the event of a variety of scenarios and by not having a single point of failure. 
The risks the bank pose are more catastrophic in a macroeconomic sense...but people don't live in the macroscopic. I don't think any one of you people in this subreddit would be happy to hear, in the wake of your wallet being destroyed, that it's their fault for not doing XYZ. **It is unarguable that FIAT has as single point of failure scaled to this.** I'm saying people should not NEED to have to protect their wallets and income like this. Additionally, I imagine robberies will be far more common in the event that "Being your own bank" becomes a regular thing because we've now reintroduced a dark age problem - someone busts into your shack and steals your bag of gold you didn't hide well enough. 
Another really important argument I failed to pose earlier is that bitcoin **by design** is only a secure, convenient, safe alternative to those with access to both education and technology. Not everyone has access to the internet, or a reliable computer, or can even be left alone on a computer without potentially doing something insecure. At least when your grandmothers debit/credit card is stolen from "Microsoft technical support", it can be frozen, changed, and in many cases have funds restored. With bitcoin, you lose. Imagine how many people fall victim to a variety of financial scams from skimming to long term planned attacks. 
And I actually believe that macroscopically, the economics for Bitcoin may arguably be worse due to the unforeseen consequences of people not having any reactionary frameworks set in place in the event their wallet is lost/stolen/destroyed/ect. by design. I can't imagine the economy reacting positively towards any percentage of people who lose their entire net worth in one mistake/incident. Want to know why people don't put a gun to someone's head and say "go withdraw all of the money in your bank account now"? Because they say "give me all the money in your wallet" because those extra steps are just not worth taking for armature/small time criminals. Which is good for society because the majority of criminals are just that - amateur and small timers.  In a "Be your own bank" world, those same small timers are now capable of taking everything, with a far better chance of not being caught. 
But see here lies the problem I'm trying to get across: If you agree that BTC can't be a replacement and it should be used as a store of value and you bounce between FIAT and BTC, then you haven't really done anything except put a portion of your net worth into a high volitale market. In addition to that, until BTC formally takes over as the daily driver at critical mass, BTC is tied 100% to FIAT, which makes it just FIAT with extra steps, extra risk, extra volatility, extra taxes, and extra security (Assuming you set this up right, which I think most users wont). As it stands right now, there is little benefit to using any cryptocurrency outside of a few niche cases, several of which are in the gray area of legality or just flat out illegal. Not all, but several. 
Looking at FIAT and BTC as products side by side, it's pretty hard not to see the glaring issues. And it seems there hasn't been a lot of dialogue or literature outlining the potential economic and societal repercussions to adopting a cryptocurrency as a daily driver - especially one as archaic and underdeveloped (relatively) as Bitcoin.
Do any of you believe in Litecoin as much as you do BTC? Because the vibe I'm getting around here with LTC is that it's a BTC clone, doesn't do anything new, and is still around because its been around. What about dogecoin? Can you at least agree Dogecoin only holds value due to its age when compared to other cryptos? Well that will eventually be balanced in the form of a correction and I believe BTC is headed that way as well if it's marketing (mostly handled by our collective hivemind) and it's goals as a **product**. Discard the political ideology for just a moment and convince me to use bitcoin based off it's features. Then do the same with FIAT. It's easy to find hard sells on both end, but as it stands, the best worst option (FIAT) is better than all of the other options (BTC+ALTs) because the other options just cant stand the test of human error and uncontrollable circumstances. FIAT can. Please keep in mind I do not like the conclusions I'm making, but they are hard truths from my perspective. Eventually the fire on the 1st floor is going to come up here to the 3rd floor regardless of whether or not I choose to acknowledge the problem. 
I understand that it may seem like I'm arguing points you're not making, but every remedy I've seen for any one of these numerous problems I've outlined in my posts is a step towards centralization and so long as BTC is centralized, it is just not worth the switch from FIAT to BTC with the platform as it stands and seems to be developing towards. BTC being decentralized is the only thing that makes up for all of its issues, much like how centralization of FIAT with their respective governments overshadows all of it's good offerings.

Hey, no disagreements here. Sorry for replying with such aggression! Very hypocritical of me given my OP. 
I appreciate the lesson in writing, I'm hoping it's come from a place of sincerity and not a backhanded insinuation. I'm well aware of the lack of organization in my posts, though I think your comment, if sincere, has pivoted my perception of the importance of organization in my replies to this post. 
I think I do present some of these critiques of yours in my posts, but I cannot disagree with the fact that it's very long and a bit scattered. 
I do, however, believe it's necessary to be long winded in internet dialogues because the shorter your rebuttal is, the easier it is for someone to someone to attack it in a fallacious way. 
With reddit's platform, I'm not arguing with the person I'm replying to, I'm arguing to the lurkers who are on the fence, as those who have already decided their opinions are unlikely to change them when a stance on an issue is rooted in a fiscal risk, such as holding BTC. 
I'll admit, I definitely wrote it in a stream of conscious way so that it would be posted early enough to be read in the wake of this post being mass up voted in order to increase the chances of a discussion. I think it's important to have a discussion like this because the "turning a blind eye to critiques" that is so often seen in the crypto world has led to a lot of uninformed people making bad decisions while believing they're making an informed decision. 
I do however lament in the critique that my comments were unorganized when the OP Image macro is both too reductionist and too misleading. The critique is missing there because it falls into the confirmation bias for a lot of users here. I don't mean to imply in any capacity that, because the OP image wasn't critiqued for it's writing/presentation, I shouldn't be. I just find the irony of it a bit funny. 
I believe in a normal environment, my writing style is better paced and organized but I sacrificed the convenience of that unintentionally for the sake of getting my thoughts out NOW instead of later, and perhaps too late. 
Reading it back over it's clear that it could be shortened and organized. 
I do want to mention the need to go down all possible paths in the argument to get ahead of the predicted, fallacy driven rebuttal I've come to expect when critiquing BTC on a fundamental level in this space. It's absurd to be that there are arguments in response to mine such as "They'll make a BTC bank!", "Maybe we shouldn't coddle people - if they lose their money its their fault", "We'll buy insurance on wallets if you lose them" that are well received by the community despite them being unspecific arguments to a very specific argument. 
TLDR: 
1. It is frustrating that the standard of informational verification and allowance for simplistic theories is the norm in the Bitcoin community now. 
2. The reactionary responses to arguments critiquing BTC is problematic to BTC long term as it slowly drives out reasonable debate and encourages hivemind thinking focused on increasing the image of BTC to increase the price of their BTC. 
3. To get around this, I go on too long to try to preemptively negate these arguments as well as a litmus test of sorts to find people willing to have long dialogues over the subject to search for solutions. 
4. I agree with most if not all of your critiques. 
You right homie

I think my assumptions of the issues normal people would face when using bitcoin daily is far more realistic than your assumption of bitcoin providing you a yacht in the future. 
Your failure to address any point I’ve made with a real rebuttal  proves your fiscal and emotional bias.
@_date: 2019-07-06 09:48:32
I think the majority of my points are based in the fundamental flaw/feature of decentralization. It's a quality that can't really be done halfway without compromising the whole. This is the inherent flaw in Bitcoin that couldn't be calculated or known with 100% certainty; "Is society and the people within it ready, capable, and reliable enough to use this technology?" and the answer to that, as it stands now, is no. And without widespread adoption, it will never replace FIAT. In my opinion, if replacing FIAT is the goal of Bitcoin/certain cryptocurrencies and they fail to overcome the issues to make it easily adopted then they are an investment with an expiration date within our lifetimes. That's what I meant when the "dust settles", because the majority of people I know only know Bitcoin as this magic black box that turns 50 dollars into 100,000 dollars. An investment medium. If the price stabilizes and these issues haven't been resolved, then the currency will fail and cause a sudden realization that the experiment had run it's course and the verdict is: it's too political, time consuming, confusing and risky to use as a currency and it's no longer a vessel for blind investment gains. That will spread at a high velocity and the price will crash. When you imagine cryptocurrencies as companies and the currencies features and qualities as products then you'll see the majority of Cryptocurrencies are in the "Kickstarter" stage of their development and you have the option to buy in early. They're like stocks for tech companies still in the startup phase minus regulation and accountability. I've yet to see a cryptocurrency that can honestly be said to be a good replacement for FIAT.
Ignore the price and value of cryptocurrency and look at their features and ask yourself if you need these features on a daily spending basis. Now look at the individual security and reliability problems introduced through adoption. Will you commit to using any of these products every day? Seriously ask yourself: say tomorrow everyone in the United States says "Bitcoin is now my daily driver". Think about the next year of your life and the extra steps added to so many menial, simple things. Think about your mother and grandmother. Think about a child with an allowance. It just doesn't work on so many levels. 
And these days, the alt coins almost target the ones that fall between the Novice and the Expert. Alt coins now can be launched with JUST a white paper. Then they hold an ICO, use the valuation of their coins to fund their development. If you are not thinking "WTF" in your head, reread that with the idea of a product. Apple will sell you the iPhone YXPLUSPLUS today and when you buy it, you don't get the phone but a token worth 1 phone. Hopefully enough people buy it! Otherwise Apple will try and make it anyways, without the required funding to make it work, and you'll get a DOA product or worse: you'll baghold the token waiting forever for your phone. At least Satoshi spent (according to his words) 2 years on Bitcoin before releasing it. And even then, he wrote the whitepaper AFTER the majority of the coding was finished! 
If you imagine the market cap and/or core fiscal value of crypto, you have two massive tumors inflating it's price:
1. Bitcoin, which other than a store of value, poses a very small chance of being adopted as a FIAT replacement. Offering no other features, such as 100% anonymity, smart contracts, or speed it is absolutely worthless. Since bitcoin as a platform (and most crypto fall in this group) doesn't offer the ability to be safe, reliable, and low risk, it has no noteworthy additional features that aren't further developed by other cryptos and therefore a negative improvement to the money replacement dream. Of course if it wants to market itself away from a FIAT replacement but a decentralized store of value, then fine - but start calling it that because misrepresenting it brings a lot of money in that will be quickly removed when "the dust settles". 
2. Over valued alt coins that are in development only after post ICO, too slow in development regardless of when they started, or too redundant without adding any new features to the marketplace.
These two groups contribute to **2/3rds of the total market cap of all cryptos**. This is a terrifying thought because the marketplace is a "feels over reals" place in the macro scale. Right now, feels over reals is making a lot of people super rich and will make a lot of uninformed people very poor. Thats the micro look But looking further out people will eventually wise up for a variety of reasons, several of which I've written above and are fairy predictable to anyone looking at this space without rose colored glasses. 
I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad or anything - it started the revolution. And I think in 100 years it will be looked back on as a legacy coin, the beginning of them all. The first blockchain. But that's not a convincing argument to justify it's value when FIAT's argument is "run by the people who run this country + most of the world". At the end of the day, an attack on my FIAT is an attack on the government. The government takes it seriously because the trust in the FIAT system is the backbone of the trust in it's government. This is obvious when looking at modern examples of national currencies failing. 
I think the best course of strategy for the community would be to try a more honest advertising of Bitcoin, even if it means less money coming in and less gains in their investments. I also think the developers and community should be more detailed as what it's supposed to be. Because right now, it's not a FIAT replacement and it really only does me one good: giving me money that might make more money and giving me something I can use in less than legal purchases - despite the fact that these people hurt crypto's image and branding, I imagine they are the 2nd or 3rd largest group of people using bitcoin, with  obviously being investors, both professional and amateur. 
Hope bitcoin evolves. Really do.
@_date: 2019-07-06 10:20:53
I agree. I am not arguing the true trajectory of crypto. I'm suggesting that the vast majority of investors and early adopters in this space are under the impression it will be a replacement, or at least that the goals are to achieve that, regardless of how long it will take. 
I'm saying that this is impossible, for the reasons in my previous comments. 
I'm saying that IF my view of this is correct THEN the only coins that even have a chance at replacing FIAT do not account for the majority of the current market cap for the crypto market, which means that it's inflated from both market meddling and emotion and will be corrected in a catastrophic way for some investors.
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:08:10
I agree, see my other replies for elaboration. The technology will last, but the fanciful idea of replacing FIAT will not in its current state. Which leaves a 300+ billion dollar time bomb waiting to go off when everyone realizes this potential outcome. Trustless chain storage has huge ramifications and benefits. But not for replacing fiat.

Whether you're an elaborate troll or totally uneducated, I'm not taking the bait.
@_date: 2019-07-06 10:17:17
The single point of failure that is an inherent flaw in cryptocurrencies is unavoidable. Right now, if decentralization means "No new minting of coins" and "you are your own bank" then it will not hit critical adoption. This is a fact. You can not suggest that we should implement a system that offers ZERO reactionary options in the event of a mistake, tragedy, or crime. Imagine if there is a 9.1 earthquake in Los Angeles and everyone's shit is destroyed. Even though you were smart and put your private key in TWO different banks, you think you're good. But whoops, not smart enough! Because you didn't put the two private keys in two separate STATES. Whoops. Now imagine everyone else not as smart or prepared. Yup, all of that money is just wiped out. 
This is just an example, but your response is a bit reductionist to the problems I'm posing. And that's okay - you shouldn't be able to answer these questions in 1 paragraph. This is a complicated thing that these developers are doing here with very nuanced, far reaching effects on our economies, day to day lives, and the course of our entire lives. 
The evolution of exchanges isn't a convincing argument for me. If you store your bitcoin in a bitcoin bank, then is it really decentralized? Just sounds like a bank that, if robbed, you're fucked without recourse. FIAT doesn't have a single point of failure. It has been proven to overcome the most drastic economic problems to date. It's also introduced some devastating problems that bled into the lower and middle class. People die when they run out of money and some decisions made by governments and their FIATs made a lot of innocent people run out of money.  
Bitcoin offers the same type of catastrophic end-game problems but is incapable of even remotely having a fail-safe on both small scales (like robberies and money destroyed in disasters) and large scales (like 2008 and corporate irresponsibility). 
That, fundamentally, will always be the barrier for mass adoption. It's really easy to argue against that when you don't use bitcoin every day and are fueled by both a fiscal incentive for BTC to succeed as an early adopter and an emotional incentive for BTC to succeed because it aligns with your political views. These are both extremely poor foundations for both arguments and value.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:32:51
Yeah read my others posts. This has been addressed. Your attempts at keeping a reductionist conversation only helps your own cognitive bias survive. 
Your USD has a lot of backing and protections - if you are robbed, your bank is robbed, or your money is stolen through a skimmer or scam, you’re 99% of the time protected. My bank by default had 250k FDIC insurance. Had thousands stolen from me and it was returned over night. Imagine a stuxnet level attack on people’s wallets and you’ll be selling your yacht to pay your diesel bill. 
You clearly are having issues imagining a world where bitcoin doesn’t work perfectly and/or a world where people don’t make mistakes. You have no idea how easy it is to compromise someone’s security. No one should need government grade encryption skills, techniques, and software to protect their life’s savings and be expected not to make mistakes or be vulnerable to malicious attacks or else they lose everything. 
You’re insane if you think you’ll be on a yacht before people realize this. And the fact that your key argument is being on your own yacht is proof you not only don’t have bitcoins best interests at heart, but see bitcoin as morning more than an investment vessel which is precisely the narrative im outlining in which I pose a huge incoming correction in BTCs price when it stabilizes and no longer serves as a 1000% profit machine and has to rely on its functions and features. That’s where it fails.
@_date: 2019-07-06 09:52:46
I'm well aware of the need for a trustless decentralized replacement for FIAT. That's not my argument. My argument is that bitcoin isn't that now with it's current features. Given the principals of cryptographic currencies being decentralized it's difficult to create a crypto that will be able to replace FIAT without adding additional risks that are mitigated in a Gov controlled FIAT system. It's not black and white. There are some pros to the government being in control of the currency, though a lot of negatives. There are a lot of pros to Bitcoin/cryptos, but there is a LOT of risk and complications to the standard, simple transaction process of spending money. 
Please read my response to the other comment, I expand on this a bit more.
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:09:49

You are naive if you think that insurance corrects this issue economically. Are you insured in FIAT or coin? Who keeps track of the amount of stolen and replaced bitcoin? What about the bitcoin lost through destruction? That’s just gone. Who’s keeping track of total new lost/unspendable bitcoin? How do you pay someone in Bitcoin when their coin is destroyed/unrecoverable and then pay them, reducing total supply. Then, what happens when you repay them in a denomination of that supply? How does this over time effect the economy? 
It’s so much more complicated then what you’re making it out to be and you doing that is a symptom of the problems I’ve addressed in my posts. You dismissed my entire economic and societal arguments in one sentence that is wrong both in a simplistic perspective and in a detailed on. This type of response only solidifies my fears because it shows you’re confident in your belief to even reply despite having not thought out what you’re rebutting against.

But throwing around dumb analogies of it being akin to gambling without contesting the core elements of bitcoin is a waste of your own time. We're not influenced by your short sighted pessimism however we are entertained by the amount of time you spend either trolling the subreddit or trying to pick arguments on a bitcoin enthusiast subreddit, whichever one may be true.
