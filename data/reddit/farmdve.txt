I personally came to the conclusion that it was manipulation.

Those knifes(saw?) don't last long. A few uses and it's flat. Even the ones meant for Wood&amp;Metal.
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:52:49
But I'd argue that if it does, it needs to stay there for a while for there to be a confirmation.
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:55:13
I am rather skeptical of this claim. If we can go back to 20k first, then sure it won't be a pipe dream, but realistically without adoption this will be difficult.
Also the 20k rise was due to Tether issuance.
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:18:06
Just as expected, this being denied AND the small pump beforehand, which would later lead to a decrease in price for sure.
@_date: 2014-12-09 00:00:39
You deserve to be reimbursed. Sue bc.i if they refuse. 100btc is no laughing matter(not that 5 would be any less important).
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:21:31
Let us not forget, satoshi may not have spent any bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:31:19
He mentioned it, though.
"Examples are: computer processing power, bandwith and
data storage. These resources would make a limited peer to peer money
exchange system possible"
Oh wait, he just described the THREE things about bitcoin that make it what it is. Mining, Blockchain, P2P communication.
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:54:07
OP, you are entitled to your Bitcoins, so piuk must reimburse you by whatever means.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:34:40
Your question is related to the protocol, not the wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:54:45
By then that size will be like ...10-100 KILOBYTES today.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:16:41
You answered your question yourself. Wallet is a collection of private keys that authorizes you to spend some bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:55:13
I don't think it can work out with just the EMA, I am not experienced with trading bots, and you seem to be a few steps ahead of me in that regard, but EMA can often be wrong and give you a general direction of the market, you need different algos imho.
In any case I am interested too. Exchanges are riddled with bots, why should we always draw the short stick?
@_date: 2015-01-22 08:23:24
It would be very dumb if there wasn't some sort of daily backup, even hourly, as for instance the marketplace would lose valuable evidence of say deals/scams.

Somewhere, there is a Bitcoin-only donut shop.

Where have you ever seen .4 of a tx?
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:22:33
People really are dumb. Once hacker procures access to some coins, he transfers them to his own address. Why can't they understand?
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:30:20
Better a slightly higher wait time, than millions of dollars worth of bitcoins being stolen, you have to start drawing the line between security and speed at some point.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:44:42
Was not around for a while. What happened to them?
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:45:41
Good call on the 'Hearnia'. I've used it myself before. Thank god it removed itself.

"It hurt itself in its confusion."
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:08:23
It would be very disturbing if you thought that having a full node on your PC meant you were generating any bitcoins. It doesn't work like that, since at least 2010.
@_date: 2019-11-01 11:32:20


What does this mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:21:08
Late to the game, huh? 5850 and 5870 all the way.
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:21:07
I don't like the swirly shape.

Fun fact, he was the author of minerd and pushpool, the base code that would later become cgminer.

This is true regardless of type of wealth. Tell everyone and there's bound to be at least one person who wants that wealth, using any means necessary.

Dunno, she gave away free money so...In any case, these were ingenious, even if I tried hard enough, I could never come up with any clue. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:35:27
So tell me how nearly $7800 is normal on Bitfinex. Either it's a bug or price really reached such a high.

Hashrate growth alone != Security.

You are comparing price, not volume. Pretty sure stocks move trillions and are a lot more liquid.
@_date: 2018-10-24 15:29:02
I hope so, I just don't want it to be one chinese person or group.

That's why he's a hernia to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:01:18
He's implying double standards. Neither currency is immune from crashes.

The crime in Brazil must be huge. Just look at the stuff that happens there, guns, drugs.
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:56:27
No, it means you can put something like a note when sending Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:13:54
Time to revive then
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:06:38
I'm glad you also see it :)
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:26:47
I stopped any sort of mining in 2014. I had purchased an S1 too late and when I got it, I mined for just 20 days before reselling it, as all the calculators showed an avg increase of 20% difficulty and ROI was pretty much guaranteed to not happen.. I was of course correct in that decision.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:19:40
At least we had fun. Everyone could mine, even your average Joe, now it's reserved people living near power plants or going solar.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:34:31
Who knew it was possible to run a bitcoin mining pool, develop a protocol for mining, develop a hardware wallet and support Bitcoin, without scamming anyone and running away with the coins.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:59:16
I'm boarding the 5850 train! 
I also mined with a 5850 and also on Deepbit in 2011. However my 5850 brought me hundreds of percents of profit, with no investment from me.
It mined me two blocks on solo. With the first block I bought a 5870.
Ever since, I've never had a year as good as 2011. Best year of my life, easily.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:47:37
They are lambo branded aren't they.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:36:55
I agree, and if I remember correctly, Satoshi didn't like the idea of pools. Mainly for this reason.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:31:02
Pre 2011?
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:59:47
Yep this sounds much better, and here I am with $0.13 per kw/h.
@_date: 2018-11-09 13:02:32
I'm interested in their verification algorithm. Would like to see their improvements for 2x speedup.

The last game had 3.5btc prize and was won by a person who had ~911BTC in his posession. At the time this was worth nearly $1,000,000 dollars. I think that was a really douche move, cause the guy kept them. So I hope this time the prize goes to somebody who truly needs them.
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:59:46
Which basically translates to very abstract thinking, outside of the box if you will. 
Have fun.

Linux is a kernel. Rather than telling people what OS to use, devs should release for all platforms.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:14:34
The road to the solution was not one. Hidden within the previous image were various clues, that required one to know about cryptography, steganography, morse code, riddles and so forth.
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:39:33
And then we will again experience a parabolic rise, followed by a decline.
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:44:18
Actually there is. I could compromise your private key and sign messages claiming I am you.

"640 kB ought to be enough for anybody" - Bill Gates
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:58:27
The point I attempted to make was that you cannot prove you are the original owner of a particular private key, if it was compromised. You can sign something with it, but so can the malicious person.
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:46:27
Why is this even news? I understand hitting $300, or hell, even better, hitting $1k, but ~250?
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:54:49
That isn't a public key, though. I have not checked the QR code.

Hello there fellow OCN user. I also discovered Bitcoin through OCN but in April 25th of 2011. Unfortunately as a 17 year old then, I didn't have the capacity to fathom what I was doing, I was selling instantly. Despite the fact I also once had hundreds of coins(and 2 solo blocks), I ended up with much much less today(just 2).
@_date: 2015-11-25 11:38:52
They are not wrong. I can actually put it in a laundry machine.
They come out squeaky clean.

Maybe she meant nobody gave her any bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:14:33
Isn't this supposed to promote Bitcoin? All I see is:
Growing TX fees - remember the ridiculous fees?
180 slow currencies e.g 180 altcoins with slow blocks.
Inaccessible - yep a lot of people don't want to be bothered setting up a digital wallet(old people) or homeless people who cannot own a digital device.
Too easy to hack - Do we even need a recap of all the hacks?
Not private - Bitcoin is not inherently that anonymous.
Inflation and Mismanagement - hmm, lets see, market manipulation causing wild price swings and crashes. Exchange hacks or downright purposefully mismanaging coins.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:02:02
Second rule of Bitcoin that is actually  withdraw them to a wallet you control! And then post proof with the TX signed message,because we don't actually believe you. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 16:37:01
Mm, nice I'm just about to eat some pizza actually. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:16:18
My rationale for posting this was because some people assume a bitcoin address IS a public key, when there is a difference between a bitcoin address and a public key, even if the former is derived from the latter.
