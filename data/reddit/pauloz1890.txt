I also got a reply from support finally! My BTC withdrawals have been processed. It seems our efforts here on reddit haven't gone unnoticed and may have sparked their attention. My Jan 4 AUD withdrawal may finally get processed over the next 24 hours...I'll provide updates to my situation as it changes.
The reason for them not replying for 7 days (make of it whatever you like):
"This ticket was marked as closed in the system. We recently upgraded the system and there may have been a bug that we're looking into right now."

I've been verified for over 5 months and haven't had any problems until now. I'm in a similar situation and haven't been able to withdraw AUD for over 3 weeks now. Their support will not respond to me either! Here is my situation:
To be fair, their support has always answered me in the past within 24 hours. They're probably trying to stall us because they are having trouble coming up with the cash/btc.
I'd like to see their founder Rick Day (rickigot) address these issues. I'd stay away from igot til these issues are resolved!

Thanks. I've had BTC take more than a week to be processed in the past so that doesn't surprise me. I've never had fiat take this long though. Mainly their support would answer me if I made any enquiries.

Their twitter page has actually put up replies to people (so they are not completely off the grid).

Look at my situation. My withdrawal was opened more than 3 weeks ago. I've been trying to contact support for more than 7 days. This is not an isolated incident (he has reason to be concerned) and there's reports from other users over the last 7 days or so that support isn't responding to inquiries about withdrawal delays:

I'm in a similar situation. I've been trying to get over AUD $2000 withdrawn into my bank account for more than 3 weeks now and support will not answer me! Also my BTC withdrawals (only a few BTC) have stalled completely. Here is my situation:
For the record dzeros, I've had large amounts of BTC take more than a week to be processed. So it doesn't surprise me that it is taking so long. I think I'm in a much worse situation.

Where the hell is Rick Day?!? He's been on here plenty of times before...

Mine too. I don't think igot is a scam. They may have just had some technical issues over the last couple of weeks or something.

Absolute disgrace! Many others have had issues (including myself) - let this be a very HUGE WARNING to other users getting their funds tied up with them.

It's definitely from today. He's looking at a non-perpetual swap contract on BitMEX. The price for these contracts are not the same as the current market price.

My issues: 
Others: 
Like i said, I doubt they are a scam. They are just very slow. My latest BTC withdrawals have taken more than 3 days each...and they were quite small amounts mind you (around 1-3 BTC).
How long has it been exactly? I've had BTC withdrawals take more than 5 days in the past
