Wait for a pump and then sell it for bitcoin or usd. Also do your own research. Everyone’s advice at first was dump but they missed out on some big gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:49:25
Exactly. Someone who’s probably studied trading for 15m in their life tops got eaten alive. Shocking 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:58
It hit 5550 on gemini during that period. Bought that dip at the very bottom 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:13:16
Horrible advice. You can just buy coke with cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:46:05
Made my first ever crypto purchase on Gemini. Then went to gdax to try other exchanges out but now I’m going back. It’s great !
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:55:46
Agreed. You don’t have to tell people how much BTC / USD you have but also don’t have to pretend you’re broke and in massive debt either 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:25:00
Congrats on making money 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:12:13
People sell? Couldn’t be me!
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:28:49
Yeah that can definitely happen. Nobody knows !
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:41:45
She sucks man!
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:05:58
Well a lot of people trade alts to increase their bitcoin holdings 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:33:22
There is only one bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:31:49
He has no friends or family so will be tough 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:09
I asked this sub if it was too late to buy in September when the price was 4k. I was told it’s never too late and that’s been proven true. Best decision I’ve ever made, bitcoin has changed my life!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:50:09
Lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:31:30
Transfer your coins to a hard wallet and leave the country. You have no friends or family anyway. Start fresh with 200k worth of bitcoin. Live a minimalist style of life in South America or something

I'm extremely new to the crypto community but happy to be here. Ive used gemini but definitely want max security . So basically I would get a withdrawal code from gemini, put it in the KeepKey and it's stored there? Sorry if I sound dumb 
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:38:59
And say one day years down the road you want to exchange it for USD, you'd have a code to put it back into the exchange like gemini and then sell? Thank you for your reply

Scariest costume I’ve seen yet 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:12:52
Just bought at 7700. Back to 7200. Ugh 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:05:32
I was very close to doing that the other day but held off. Now I️ cave, lesson learned! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:55:26
I agree, it wouldn’t be everything 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:38:09
Good luck . I️ opened a ticket today and haven’t heard back yet so hopefully it’s just delayed and you’ll hear back soon
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:36:52
Bought in at 5500
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:08:48
Congrats !
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:39:29
You’ll lose it eventually 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:39:49
Been holding since august and picking more up along the way. I️ know eventually Itll be positive but just wish I️ pulled the trigger while it was at 7000, could have gotten more BTC
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:05:53
I have a mutual fund my grandma set me up with years ago that’s almost at 7k. Really tempted to put it all into bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:14:34
I bought one in august , should have went all in then. Never too late though 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:14:47
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:43:20
Kraken looks gross. Would never use them 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:42:49
They will lose it. Don’t bother 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:41:24
Will it tank in 2020?
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:28:09
Dopey Prince!
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:42:20
Time to go find some cats 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:32:52
Got back in at 5544. Feels good!! Was around 3am eastern time. Working the night shift has its perks! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:59:12
Thanks for the advice. I’m going to be traveling the day of the fork so not sure if I️ want to move my funds off my ledger and keep them in the exchange for a couple of days .   Just me being paranoid though 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:51:41
Where can I️ sell this crap? I️ only have a Gemini and coinbase account 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:01:40
More surprised that you’ve been paying for lastpass without knowing for 6 years 
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:33:09
It’s all relative. To OP he just stumbled onto nearly 500k. If I’m him I’m selling 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:27:33
I bought some at $4900 after a few drinks after I told myself I wouldn't. Whoops 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:20:45
Me too . Ugh 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:20:45
Me too . Ugh 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:29:00
Dopey Prince!
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:47:20
How were the movies? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:21:00
He’s on a campus. Of course they are watching CNN
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:39:25
Is my bitcoin safe from the fork in my nano ledger s?
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:09:28
Cool thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:24:16
Just finally got mine. Love it!
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:36:54
Time to sell and pick more back up when it dips to 3k again 
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:48:09
I remember this. Was getting an oil change sitting in the lobby freaking out. My funds are on a hard wallet to so couldn’t sell
