No not Yang, I don't think you are quite grasping the concept.

Most of what we really have HAS been destroyed.

As long as Joe Rogan commentates and thank you, I will.

"Socialist like Bernie..." hilariously ignorant.
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:59:07
You lack imagination.

Not pro crypto I mean, but using the blockchain to level the playing field by making all $1= $0. Just like in Rick and Morty.

Exactely, perhaps you lack comprehensive elasticity to comprehend what you just read. No one needs to know why you down voted, just do it and get out of the way

Thank you for the thoughtful, Extensive answer. I have a Phd. and a, planning on teaching. But, for the most part I would agree.

Tell me about it! It's freaking a nightmare. 20 years ago I traveled the world, no problem. Nation States are a joke.

DEMOCRATIC Socialist policy unlike Tour undemocratic Oil, gas, agro and military subsidies. Who is on here? 10 year olds?

Their Democratic Socialists. Jesus. Most 1st world countries have them, and if you want to go to hell in a bucket and vote against your own self interests, be my guest. I guess reddit is as ignorant as I suspected.

Excellent advice. This was just an exercise. a toe in the water, so to speak.

Thank you!

Redditor for 3 weeks, THAT'S the funniest thing I've read in a year.
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:09:04
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST POLICY. Unlike your undemocratic oil and unnatural gas and corn and agro subsidies. Jesus

True. They are a source of protein though.

I am considering selling my home in Ely, Nevada for a combination of BTC, CASH and or perhaps BTC, some cash or gold  and a trade for a property in a foreign country to have a small farm . Sounds completely reasonable if the BTC amount was not critical for survival. I am bullish on bitcoin and feel we are about to see a massive depression in the U.S.. I would rather take my chances with bitcoin and some gold and a small farm than just sit here and watch my homes value drop to 0.

So if you were selling a house for $120k, how much would you put into Bitcoin?
