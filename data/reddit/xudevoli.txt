You are an absolute genius.

On a mostly unrelated note, I can't wait for Bitcoin-related sci-fi. 
...I really hope this doesn't actually happen, but I can't help but think of how cool it is.

If only we had decentralized prediction markets. People like him could have made a fortune ;)

I am sure that will be a textbook example someday.

That's a great point. I was merely positing that Bitcoin is one of many new, more efficient "ways" to solving the "banking problem" (how can we transfer money the easiest, and how do the other perks stand up?)

Depends on where you're located. It's slow, but if you're in the US, coinbase works just fine for most.

Looking forward to see where my coins end up in the future. I don't think it's particularly healthy to watch these real-time graphs unless you're looking for a place to buy (which I was doing earlier), but movement like this is pretty captivating.

Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but 4 business days actually puts you (and I) at *Thursday* before we can do anything. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:02:42
Me too. Hold for a couple years; we'll be fine.

This is definitely the easiest possibility, and it is also very likely, assuming the people who deal with monetary policy never take the time to understand cryptographic systems 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:29:01
Not worried. Just genuinely bewildered. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:32:18
This is fun.

Link your checking account, wait 4 (?) days, and then you can make purchases whenever.

Gave him/her the gold he/she deserves (I think...first time buying)
Would have bitcoin tipped, but I don't know how to set it up/clearly do not have close to enough BTC to make a dent in this person's wallet :P 
Either way, it is so cool people like this exist and that this Bitcoin community is the way it is.

When there are robot police, sure.
