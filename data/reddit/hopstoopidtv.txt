No love for vertcoin who's waiting on these two :(

Not that advanced, apk basically unzips and with remnux you can just type two commands with no knowledge of what you're doing and have the source.

Ah yes, open source would hurt the users. /s

Can bind malware to any executable, closed source isn't the key to security. Why not use a checksum?

It just went from 1400 to 4400...

Agreed, you don't know what you're talking about.

Not to mention reversing the APK isn't a difficult task, and creating a malicious version of the app isn't that much harder to do now that they aren't sharing source.

They'll skip gold for crypto currency that has shown it can drop over 40% in value in a few weeks?

We did, then you posted in another sub. Stahp.

Took me about four hours before it was pending and then a few more for confirmations.

Kim Dotcom probably though that, right before an unnamed agency kidnapped him from his home in New Zealand because his legal business (no different than the protections google has against some of the content they list) happened to be a threat to movie/music profits. Now imagine you are working with crypto and threatening the stability of the dollar and they can excuse their actions as being in the name of protecting Americans. O.o Yeah, you're probably not as safe as you think.

As an American I'm still shocked you let us participate. :)

2/3 of Americans have no idea what it is.

All trading is gambling, crypto trading is like Russian roulette.
