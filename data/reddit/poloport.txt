Having it is enough

It just looks that way upfront.
Banks arent stupid, if there were more profit doing it that way all of them would do it.
In the end on average its the same cost

It also prevents negative feedback loops where you keep paying and your debt keeps increasing

If everyone sell at once the price collapses, just like literally every other thing in the world.
As it is gdax, a single exchange has facilitated around 500 million dollars worth of sales in the past 24 hours. Cinsidering theres dozens of exchanges and gdax isnt even the biggest its pretty reasonable to say that if you want to sell 1 billion dollars worth of crypto you can do it without too much trouble over a couple of days

Quick note about portugal.
Bitcoin is tax free there, there was a thread a few days ago from a btc trader guy who asked the tax office for an official binding declaration on how bitcoin is taxed, and received a "it isnt currently predicted in the tax law and is therefore tax free."
This is binding for the year of 2017 and before.

There's a big diference in the way interest in islamic banking works, compared to other banking.
To be honest i think the way it interest works in Islamic banking is significantly better than in western banking.

Only because its allowed.

You only pay taxes on where you reside at the time where you made the profit...

I had a similar issue. Just do the verification entirely through coinbase

The transaction id youre refering to is probably the internal coinbase transaction id. 
What you need to find the transaction in the blockchain is the transaction hash which you can find in the account/transfers section. If the transaction hasnt been put into a block, it hasnt gine thriugh yet and you wont see a hash

The bubble has popped. We have to settle with out 50% gainzzz
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:47:20
And you don't pay interest on interest

But the gains!

As everyone should.
Whenever i think about investing into a crypto currency, i read the white paper and try to think of a way to hack it. If i can think of a way to do it, and i dont see it addressed in the white paper, i dont even consider investing in it
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:05:50
Which is just about the only country in the world that does it

Depends on where you are.
Try to pay more than 500€ worth of taxes in cash and you're committing a crime where i'm from. Want to use cash for any transaction over 3000€? That's a crime too. Are you a company? If you pay or receive anything over 1000€ in cash, that's a crime too.
I can't buy a house in cash. I can't buy a truck in cash. Hell, i couldn't buy the newest iPhone in cash if i wanted to.

Good thing mining rewards halve
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:41:13
Anyone willing to buy. Depebding on the price your selling them for it can be no one (if too expensive) or millions of people (if very cheap).
If you're selling some under 1k euros ill buy them from you

This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:33:18
To be honest i don't really consider ethereum and bitcoin to be competing with each other. From what i understand they both have fundamentally different principles, goals and technology, and both of them are solid enough to succeed in their own way.
I don't think either of them will replace government backed fiat currency, but they both have their place on the market.

I'm from Portugal. The fascist dictatorship didn't have these restrictions when they were around, but i guess they are ok if we're a democracy.^^/s
