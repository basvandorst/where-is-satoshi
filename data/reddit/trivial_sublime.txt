Homie, I get what you're saying, but two problems:
1. You are objectively wrong about the percentage of the world that has internet access. We're over 51% as of June.
2. You are VASTLY underestimating how quickly the whole world will be connected. When I lived in Myanmar, I saw internet adoption go from around 15% to 80%+ in 18 months. The poorest of the poor find ways to get smartphones and get connected.

Cambodia Self-Help Demining. 
"I poke my stick in the ground till I find a mine. Then I dig around it, to make sure that it is not booby-trapped. Then, I unscrew the detonator.  And the mine is safe."
Aki Ra is a former Khmer Rouge child soldier who has dedicated his life to clearing the land mines that he and others like him set in the 1970s. There are over six million undetonated land mines in Cambodia. 
He has more than a dozen adopted children, all victims of land mines and land mine orphans.
He teaches people how to disarm land mines on their own. While the UN can disarm a Landmine for $2,500, Aki Ra and his deminers can do it for about $25. 
Read his Badass of the Week page. 
They may not accept Bitcoin up front on the website, but the head of the charity is a pretty tech savvy guy that can easily make it work. His name is Bill Morse and I can put you directly in touch with him.

They probably tried to offset more than $3k of income on short-term losses. You need to hold it for a year to get maximum tax advantages. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:11:23
I’m talking about the statistic that “40% of the world is connected to the Internet.” It’s 51%. Your own source said it was 46% a year and a half ago.
I don’t give a shit about how many boomers there are. Ten years ago baby boomers weren’t using online shopping - to say they won’t do it because they don’t do it now is incredibly short-sighted.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:08:19
That's not true. You absolutely can, up to the amount of your investments in the year. If net losses in your investment accounts exceed net gains for the year, then there would be no reportable income from the security sales. You can offset up to $3,000 of short-term sales losses against other income, too.

No, because Bitcoin is an asset, not a business expense. A business expense is something that you will use in the ordinary and necessary course of your business, such as a rake for a lawn care business, or a computer for a day-trading business. 
An asset like Bitcoin can appreciate or depreciate in value. On the flip side, if your Bitcoin goes down in value and you convert to fiat, you get a tax break on the amount that you lost.

And the government wouldn’t tax that fruit if you eat it or give it to friends or family. If you turned around and sold it, on the other hand, they would tax the money you made selling it. 
Plus you would be able to write off the costs of seeds and inputs as a business expense and so they wouldn’t be post tax dollars in the first place. 
Your hypothetical really doesn’t work when applied to reality.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:53:48
Absolutely; it really is important to learn this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:05:57
He keeps using that analogy and doesn’t understand how taxes work. The seeds he bought would not be purchased with post-tax income if he sold the fruit, as it would be a business expense and would be written off.

You don’t use post tax money to create your wealth when growing fruit. You are not taxed on the inputs to create your fruit (at least not income tax) because it is a business expense and is deductible. 
Edit: it WOULD be double dipping if you had to use post-tax income though, so I can see why you would be upset. But in reality you would not use post-tax income.

Hell if I know. I chucked that computer. I mined around 100BTC worth in 2010 just to mess around. Man I wish I had some foresight :/
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:36:55
Regardless of whether you are a professional fruit grower or farmer, or just an average Joe that works for a living with a few fruit trees, you still get to deduct the amount that you spend producing those fruits if you are selling them. The rules are not different (at least in the limited scope that we are discussing). 
The rule of thumb in the tax system is that if you make more money, you get taxed on the new money. If you lose money, you get a tax break on the money you invested. Once you start making exceptions, you really start to complicate the already-complicated tax system.

One of us obviously is, and I’m pretty sure it’s the one that can’t read his own statistics that he cites.

In July 2016, a full year and a half ago, 46% of people were on the internet FROM YOUR SOURCE. You can't just round down because it is convenient. Now it's 51%.
Yeah, smart phones are different than an actual desktop/laptop at home. Guess which one is required to use Bitcoin?
edit: what is your point with the under 18/over 50 statistic? Why don't we break that down to under 18 OR over 50, and over 50 is MASSIVELY smaller, especially in developing countries. You just don't find that many old people in the developing world. I feel like you're intentionally misrepresenting statistics here.

All you have to do is add BTCUSD=X to your Stocks app on the iPhone, and then pick the Utility face by force-pushing on the screen. Hit customize, and swipe until you get to the bottom complication, then turn the crown until it gets to the Stock app. If it's a different stock, go back to the watch face, tap the stock, and then tap BTCUSD=X and then back out with the crown. That should get it for you. And now you will check your watch every 30 seconds for the rest of your life. I'm not sorry.

Saying BTC doesn't have consensus when compared to the dollar is like saying the dollar doesn't have consensus when compared to hydrogen. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. The dollar isn't a cryptocurrency, nor is BTC a fork of the dollar. You're comparing apples to gravity.
