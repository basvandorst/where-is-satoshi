Darkwallet does the opposite of what Cryptocurrencies want to achieve. Decentralization

You need more than 50% of the master nodes and mining power to do that. Approx $2m + muuuch pool power atm

Honest question, why did you not cash those invested dollars out after the price rose up? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:28:18
Yeah. I was like wtf is that guy talking about :D

You make money in drops and lose it in buckets. Who says "oh well I lost $50,000 today but made $53,000 the rest of the week

The comments are pure gold
"PayPal is so much better"
Yeah for the buyer maybe, but for the seller or receiver of the money it's a pure nightmare
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:16:33

You even prooved that they are not correctly labelled. With the y-axis I agree though.
If someone would look at the graph and didn't know what it was about, he/she would not assume what you said about the candles. There is just a specific date in the label therefore noone would assume it is the period of a year.
