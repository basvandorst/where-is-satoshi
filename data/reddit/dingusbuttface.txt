NO NO NO...jesus christ you just want to BE right but you're not.  It doesn't have fucking extrinsic value from your ass taking the gold out and selling it.  It has INTRINSIC market value because something you bought FUCKING HAD TO HAVE IT. 
How is this hard for you to comprehend?  
I tell you what, stop using all electronic devices because gold has no god damn intrinsic market value.  Tell all your friends and convince the world too that they need to stop using most electronic devices because it has gold in it.  THEY WILL NOT DO THAT so they are forced to actually buy gold.  That is intrinsic market value.

But...it is not.  You're missing the point.  Gold simply has intrinsic market value.  If you want a computer or many, many types of electronics, you want gold.  Still this intrinsic market value is less than 5 bucks.

You are going to give money to the one that is your friend.  It's human nature and is precisely why you've seen the incredible disparity between the rich and the poor since going off the gold standard.

I wish I had seen this sooner so I could challenge you to actually prove any of this bullshit.  


All hail the mighty master that has spoken truth as honey floweth from the god's mouth.  You sir have bought the Keynesian bullshit hook, line and sinker.  The great thing is even you will switch to a currency that goes up in value.  It's going to be fun to watch.
Deflation is FAR from bad.  I find it absurdly retarded that idiots like you think only a currency can be deflationary.  Anything, you retarded waste of space and time, can be deflationary and IS!!!  In your whacky, whacky whack-a-mole world, anything that goes up in value is a bad thing.


Once again you show your absolute brainwashed convictions as if the only way for anyone to get a loan is if someone else just prints fucking money.  If you weren't such a complete imbecile you'd realize that if money is going UP in value, banks(anyone with cash) would actually have to lend LESS and those that provide goods and services would ACCEPT less.  THANK GOD the days of your worthless FED/Bank produced monopoly money are short-lived.  We'll all get to see what happens when the people have money that actually holds it's value over time.
It is absurd that you look at just ONE side of possibilities with a currency that increases in value.  Actually it's not absurd--IT'S FUCKING DISINGENUOUS!
What you WILL see is people loaning money at a fixed interest rate of 1-5% and THAT will be a good damn return.  Also, homeowners will sell their homes themselves and offer shares for their houses rather than going through a bank(what the fuck is the point really).  The upshot is there will be less debt with MORE personal wealth for individuals.


I'm sorry the FACT the United States went off the gold standard in the 70s has  produced the greatest income disparity between the rich and poor that we've ever seen has escaped you.  Perhaps you should learn to read fucking charts.  Then again, you'd chalk it up to just some odd correlation that means nothing because you're a nimrod of the highest caliber that can't put 1 and 1 together if 2 was the only choice.
In short, any time you'd like me to explain these things to you in terms your toddler brain can understand and you're ready to open your mind to economic theory that opposes your bigotry, you can shoot me an email.  I'll try not to be too condescending.

@_date: 2014-09-27 00:19:36
None of this is true.  It's unfortunate that people believe this malarkey.  Saving a deflationary currency limits the supply more, increasing the value of any that is spent causing goods and services to be traded at a normal rate.  As the currency is spent, the effect is even greater in an economy.  
Also, the argument that a currency gaining value over time causing people not to spend is just plain silly.  The same could be said for goods that gain value over time.  Why sell them if they'll be worth more in the future?  Stupid.
Another thing, if anyone buys this Keynesian bullshit about constantly creating more money, that's fine, give it to everyone fucking equally.  Why should a small group of people be able to create currency at will and debase everyone else's savings?

BitLicense: The Real Plan
The real plan behind bitlicense is to make bitcoin more difficult to use in legal terms compared to the US dollar.
If they can get people scared to use it legally and/or charge more taxes when it is used legally than would be required using US dollars then they will slow adoption and embolden the skeptics.
After this precedent is established, the intent is to encourage governments around the world to adopt the same stance.

Yeah, I'd say that's pretty fucking bad.  Now compared to countries where you have less democracy and they can do EXACTLY what they WANT without having to pull the wool over the eyes of those pesky voters, it's not as bad.  Should we really compare Japan or the United States to that type of country?
There's a reason the divide between the rich and the poor is so great.  When you go off the gold standard (or anything that regulates currency production) those closest to the money creators are going to become obscenely rich.  
Govt debt is run up and the central bankers tell everyone we must create more money so the relative debt isn't as great.  Nice little trick if you are the guy creating money, loaning it out and collecting the returns.
Now, I'd be all for currency creation by central bankers if all new units of currency were given to each citizen equally.  Afterall, one of the primary theories for currency production is to stimulate the economy.  It's hard to see why giving new units equally to everyone wouldn't stimulate the economy.  I know I'd go buy some shit.  Do you really see this happening though?  Why not?  You think it's crazy BUT why should one group get to create new money, loan it out and collect the returns.  You KNOW in your heart the way the current system exists is morally corrupt and personally I'd say EVIL.

It's NOT ready.  Road signs built into maps???  Really, just NO.  If I relied on my GPS telling me when to turn, I would have driven off so many bridges trying to get onto an on ramp.  Even if you get less than a meter of accuracy, there is STILL a world of play with that.  
This doesn't even account for roads without clearly painted center lines, rain, snow, fog.
They don't even have backups built into this.  Mark my words, we're going to see a LOT of deaths AND lawsuits from these cars killing those not driving them as well.

Ok, think of it like this.  Let's say your house has some hedges around it.  They are untidy and growing wildly.  You can leave it like that or you can make it more presentable by hedging.
Same's true of bitcoin.  Once hedging begins, many of the unruly ruffians will be trimmed into shape or just removed.  This will give bitcoin a much better reputation.

That's not how it works.  That would be 3425.00 bits/μBTC/xbt/whatever.  
Bitcoin has 8 digits to the right currently.  The primary proposal is that everything be displayed in μBTC so your example would be 3425.00 μBTC.  I prefer the name bits but it's not a big deal one way or the other.  So that would also be 3425.00 bits.  The main thing is everything should be displayed/bought/sold in terms of two digits to the right because that is what people recognize as currency notation.

All bitcoin really has to do is stay where it's at for a long period of time and people will come.

Years ago when I got into bitcoin, I would have thought price crashes were a bad thing.  It's just every time it happens, there has been an expansion and recovery.  Perhaps this time is different but I doubt it.  It's not something that is just going to go away.
If and when it passes it's old highs again, you'll see another round of super-optimism followed by a HUGE price increase, an inevitable pull back and then a crash. 
If this guy isn't subject to confirmation bias, I'd just like to know, what makes this time so unique?   I just don't see it.

Honestly anyone that thinks like this is a complete fucking idiot.  Let me ask you this, can you trade the US dollar?  Can one US dollar be substituted for another US dollar in any trade?  IT'S A FUCKING COMMODITY YOU RETARD.  
Perhaps it doesn't meet some dumb ass strict definition of yours but IT'S A FUCKING COMMODITY and IT IS MARKETED.  You are marketing it now and disparaging another commodity--bitcoin.  The problem is you don't even know why you are doing this.  You hate bitcoin because you don't understand money itself or the true role it should play.
As I told your DUMB ASS from the start, I would be all in favor of the US dollar and ANY currency expanding IF equal units were simply given to all citizens equally.  As this is not the case, and it's banks and the FED that create money and sit back waiting for the debt collection to come in, I can tell you without hesitation that not only is it bad for individuals, it is morally evil.  You have to be a retard of incredible proportions not to see this.  A lot of people choose to be blind and that's your choice but if you think I'm going to join you, you can go fuck yourself.  


I understand everything you are regurgitating.  The problem is you're wrong and think you're right.  
I find you to be a very silly, pedantic person that has no clue who he is talking to.  I am 63 years old.  I am a millionaire a few times over.  You seem to assume I'm some naive youngster that just started investing and it's your mission to protect me from the same mistakes you made.  I certainly don't need ANYTHING from you--especially financial advice.  You don't seem to be able to recognize patterns or even understand why something could be different than assessments you've made in the past.   I've been around a long, long time and everything I told you is fact as I see it.  You're just regurgitating econ 101 to me.  I know it AND I know where it's lacking.  I also know precisely why bitcoin is unique and very special.
Let me give you a tip.  Bitcoin could very well go below 100 but I don't see it going below 50 dollars AND I see it continuing to grow albeit in fits and starts.  Assholes like you will continue to help the regimes of the world and slow the progress of an honest currency like bitcoin BUT the cat is out of the bag and there is no turning back.  
The grand thing with this is, we'll both get to see who was correct in under 10 years--that is if I'm still around.   I have no clue how old you are.
Good luck regurgitating the party line.  I know it will not serve you well though.  There was a time you could make the assumptions you make but that time is quickly running out.   If you don't think the dollar is in major trouble, I just can't help you.  Perhaps it would be a good experiment for you to calculate precisely how long it would take for the US just to pay off the interest on it's debt now.  Then maybe you should go look at our debt to GDP ratio and compare that to any previous historic levels.  The only thing you're going to see in the future is MASSIVE inflation and it's not going to be pretty.  
Good luck with your trolling and I hope one day you can look back and realize how your campaigning was just contributing to a status quo that benefits the ultra rich at the expense of the very poor.  I hope you realize that was just wrong and I also hope you genuinely feel sorry for it.  I doubt you will though as you seem like an egomaniac to me.

How precisely do you think banks are going to create bitcoins out of thin air and loan them to people so they can see a return?  
People love authority because it didn't come from them. No one wants to see the nerds that invented bitcoin do well but the truth is, it's far better than what we currently have. This is our current money creation process:
The Fed is a group of private central banks. They essentially create money to pay for various government securities. They create this money out of thin air. Poof...here's your money. They can also create money in other various ways by controlling the interest rates banks can borrow money at (poof...here's your money) and the reserve to deposit ratios banks must follow (fractional reserve mojo). They are also involved in various other "quantitative easing" schemes that essentially amount to creating new money for banks including themselves. I would go further and wager that when you are the "lender of last resort" and aren't audited, you're likely creating money for lots of things people don't know about and better not ask about. The rabbit hole goes much deeper when you understand the whole basis for fractional reserve banking which basically means banks only have to hold a fraction of money in "reserve" or at the actual bank based on deposits that are made. They can actually lend out more than they have when new deposits are made. Now, if you control this system or are a large bank that creates money upon new deposits, how are you going to loan that money out? I know what I'm going to do, I'm going to create policies that make it perfectly legal for me to loan large amounts of money out to friends and family. Essentially those involved in the money creation process can enrich themselves while devaluing the dollar for everyone else. Nice little scheme isn't it? 
If you are a Keynesian and believe in economic stimulation and spending/borrowing your way out of recessions then that's fine. I say we stop letting a few bankers decide who gets the new money but rather give it to all Americans equally.

bits makes the most sense.  You still have 2 decimals afterward as everyone is use to.  You don't feel like you have a microDick and it's a familiar term. 
On the Bitcoin network you use bits: 123.34 bits, 56694.32 bits, etc.
Personally I think the current Bitcoin unit should be renamed the Satoshi.    1 of 21 million units to honor the man.  
The bottom line though is go with bits.  Don't call it microbits because people psychologically know micro is less than a whole and is a very small amount.  It makes you feel like you're dealing with something worthless--dust.
Either we wage two battles and lose or we wage one and win.

2 simple strategies for me.  Keep small amounts on your phone application and...  
 
Buy a cheap laptop from here:   
Install this Os:   
Install Electrum:   
Transfer your bitcoins to your electrum address. Safely store your laptop and seed word list.
Probably the best thing for ANYONE though is just to buy 5-10 bucks worth of bitcoin--just some trivial amount--and start playing with it.  Move it around.  Send it to different addresses using different computers/phones/applications.  Try to back it up, etc.  Get a feel for a small amount.  Large amounts are no different and you'll gain confidence.

I think you're all a bunch of bullshitters.  Store my bitcoins as float any day...why because it's a fucking floating point number.
1.23234, 1233.4455, 13454.2332
Just look how that decimal floats around.  How the fuck can you store that as anything but a float.  
Makes no sense to me and none of you folks can explain it so I'm chalking it up to bs.

It's the exact opposite of what I'm looking for (the micro portion) and is mostly promoted by math geeks and those that KNOW it will fail. 
With a currency you shouldn't START with a very large base unit and subdivide it.  The base unit should be small and have two trailing decimal places. It should NOT be a division of a whole.  It should NOT be called a milli, a micro, a sub anything.  It should be a whole.  A bit is a whole then go up from there.  
Also, it should be the default at EVERY site.  THAT is a HUGE problem.
Think about how dollars or Euros would look if it worked this way.  We'd start with a million dollars and call it the Dollar.  Then we'd pay for everything in microDollars.  Do you want a microDollar.  Let me give you some micro dollars.  A 20oz soda would be 0.003704 dollars.

BUNCH OF FUCKING DUMB ASSES!!

Only a moron needs a study for something this absurdly simple.  
 
I've talked to over 1000 people, literally over 1000 people about bitcoin. The two things they find unusual/frustrating are the odd positioning of the decimal (they simply can't relate that to a currency) and buying bitcoin quickly.
I am of the opinion now personally that this should be entirely obvious to anyone.  Most people that publicly push against this are trolls that want to see bitcoin fail or just people with very little ability to relate to other human beings--not sure which you are.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:22:10
Ok.  I prefer douchebag by the way.  :)
I think there isn't mass adoption because it hasn't been easy enough yet, people still think it's a scam, folks don't trust the software, there's a lot of anti-bitcoin marketing and people think there is nothing wrong with the current system.  They can't see the hidden evils.  Anyone that questions the system is labeled a quack and that message gets pushed.
It's going to happen, just slower than folks wish.  The longer bitcoin is around, the more legitimacy it has.
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:11:24
Who do you want?  Anyone connected to bankers.  That's ANYONE.  You do realize the greatest wealth disparity in the US came about AFTER we went off the gold standard.  Of course you'll likely say correlation doesn't mean causation but it doesn't mean it's NOT causation as well.
It shouldn't be a hard jump for any working mind to make to recognize that if you give anyone the power to create currency at will and loan it out they are going to loan it to friends and family first (given equal potential abilities to pay the loan back).
I KNOW I would.

You throw that insecure bullshit around to people when you can't answer their question.  Basically it's a straightforward question allowing you to demonstrate your wisdom and impart it to others.  You choose not to because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Then you start calling people names. 
In life, you can't just make a claim and have everyone believe it.  You have to demonstrate it and it's effectiveness.  You have not done that and cannot do that so you start the name calling.
You are a grade A dick though.   I'll give you that.

2 simple strategies for me. Keep small amounts on your phone application and...
Buy a cheap laptop from here:   
Install this Os:   
Install Electrum:   
Transfer your bitcoins to your electrum address. Safely store your laptop and seed word list.  
Probably the best thing for ANYONE though is just to buy 5-10 bucks worth of bitcoin--just some trivial amount--and start playing with it. Move it around. Send it to different addresses using different computers/phones/applications. Try to back it up, etc. Get a feel for a small amount. Large amounts are no different and you'll gain confidence.
@_date: 2014-10-02 19:48:19
I agree with you.  I just want to know is it an altcoin or do you use bitcoin on it?
@_date: 2014-09-28 12:36:48
I read up until the point that I saw you only posted one page long non-Wikipedia link.  I then realized you're not very serious with your trolling.
I honestly feel sorry for people that believe bullshit like this.  The chickens are coming home to roost for many currencies very soon and the US dollar is one of them.  
Many people see through this bullshit though.  Especially when trolls like you feel they have to go to and "educate" people on their profound understanding of the status quo.  
A currency is simply a commodity that is bought and sold throughout the world.  The US dollar is a commodity on the decline.   This video does a decent job of explaining it.  It's about 80% correct.  
 but with a bit too much gloom and doom.  
Of course, in truth, you know all this.  For whatever reason, you just enjoy marketing against something that WILL be a strong hedge against a collapsing currency.
You probably hate gold as well.  Never mind that every country in the world tries to keep their hands on a percentage of it.
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:03:12
Not at all.  It depends on how pervasive bitcoin is where you are.  If it's reached a high point of saturation and you don't have to trade it for local currency or get it by spending a local currency then it's ALMOST FUCKING FREE!

I'm 63.  Read my post history.  Not bullshitting you.  
By the way, the simplest example to prove your point according to my dev would have been:

This guy has no fucking clue what he's talking about.  He can't even give a practical example in node.js and mysql.

Dude your shit isn't original.  No one cares.  I barely read it.  
The world needs bitcoin.  You and other folks like you can preach on about how it's tin foil hattery to say that banks and the Fed create all money and they do it for their own benefit.  The problem is, it's not a tin foil hat thing.   It's fucking real and bitcoin puts an end to it.
One of these days people are going to wake up to this and bitcoin will be there.  
If you think the way money is created now is perfectly fine then stay the fuck out of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:41:08
Bitcoins fine.  The China run up got everyone WAY too excited for it's current true foundation.  
It could well drop down to 50 bucks but it will climb back up as it's base expands and utility increases.  It may take 10 years to get to 10k but I'd put my money on it running up to 5k plus in 2016.
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:12:31

LMFAO!  I just saw this.  I'm sorry but central banks existed before fucking Jesus only they didn't call them banks. Ever heard of money changers.  That's part of what a central bank was back in the day.  Central banks have pretty much existed since the dawn of man.
Any entity that controls the creation of money is a central bank whether you want to use that term or not.
Shit, Athens had money they called drachmas.  Hell all the Greek cities had their own currencies and they were NOT made of pure gold/silver.  
I'm sorry but you're just wrong.
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:49:35
Ever think there could be a correlation.  You know, like masses amounts of people seeing the price of something 400 and saying, "FUCK THAT!"
Perhaps those same people are confused about things being prices at .000034 or .0000021.  Well that just looks fucking weird.
I'll give you a personal example:  I know how bitcoin works.  I was going to buy some the other day and I didn't.  I thought to myself I don't want to pay 400 bucks for this.  Now, sure, I'm dumb as a hammer sometimes but so is John Q. Public.  For that moment, I didn't even think about buying a fraction of bitcoin because it's just not normal.

Basically they expect people to NOT abuse this but people are going to.  You are going to hear about people falling asleep at the wheel, Tesla's flying through old, barely visible stop signs and just all kinds of shit.

This is a VERY good thing for bitcoin as it will be quite easy to see how many new units there are and the central addresses they go to. 
It will make comparing bitcoin to this crap very easy--a side by side comparison.

When exactly do you believe there was no central banking or fiat money?  Your premise is based on a history that never happened.
