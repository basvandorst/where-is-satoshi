Could be , but I never saw any weird activity on my pc really , no weird programs running on taskmgr , it only happened right after I installed   minergate on my phone .

Well , now I have malware bytes installed , and I don't install the crap you're talking about , my router is now like 7 years old , maybe now is the time to upgrade ...?

I totally agree with you , but any ways to prevent this ?

I'll probably run it in a VM , not in the mood to buy a fire wall / antivirus for what's essential a piece of crap pc that has been repurposed as a friend group budget indie server .....

Ok , thanks , but while I was browsing the pc for any leftovers I found a weird link on Firefox ( rgho.st/8XjGpYYyL ) and it download a file named program.exe , I'm of course not gonna run it , but is there a way to see if it does anything without causing harm ?
EDIT : malware bytes blocked the website at the second try

That's not the point ! I know that my pc is insecure. I just found it odd that right after installing minergate on my phone it began installing on my pc.

Sure , thanks so much for your help !
(Definitely gonna use Linux this time , probably lubuntu .....)
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:58:06
I'll consider it ......
In the meantime is there anything else I can do to secure my pc further ? Thanks in advance
