Sure, happy to help out. I would rather support the thought of researching about an issue not yet solved as well. 
A problem we face with innovation is that humans first want to build existing things in another/better approach, instead of using it for revolutionary new ways. Like building higher brick walls with iron bars, instead of buildings skyscrapers completely made out of glass without bricks.  (andreas antonopoulos)
Besides that, please assess NEM before you jump into NEO. It may save you a lot of time....
For further ideas, i would have to brainstorm a little. If you want to we can discuss over telegram or PM on reddit. Otherwise good luck with your project.

This is a proud price indeed. But what you get for it is a mechanical watch with the highest quality standards possible made in Switzerland, Lucerne. 
Also you will be one of the 101 only persons owning such a masterpiece.

How about use cases of private/public blockchain for small to middle sized companies?
I have a friend which made a similar master thesis. He is careful with spreading the script though. ;-)

The starting bid was 9000 CHF in the corresponding cryptocurrency. In total there are 5 different designs, so 5 different currencies as a payment. 
The number of watches is 101 for each design, so 505 in total. So there are still some available, which will be able to purchase very soon. The official announcement about this will follow. We will drop a post on reddit as well. 
I hope this answers your question.
