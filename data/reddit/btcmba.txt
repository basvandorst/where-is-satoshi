**Using this method you can save time and send BTC securely to your winners.**
All you need to do is collect their email addresses and in 5 minutes using **RapidFire for Coinbase** you can send them their BTC prize direct from your Coinbase account.
**Benefits of using RapidFire for Coinbase vs. USB sticks and Paper Wallets**
1.  **Eliminate Waste**.  If the winner doesn't claim the bitcoins you sent within 30 days, the bitcoins will be returned to your Coinbase account.  If you pre load a USB or Paperwallet the BTC are gone forever....and in somecases may go to waste if the person doesn't figure out how to get the BTC off the USB or paperwallet.  They will also go to waste if the either the USB or paper wallet is lost/stolen.  Emailing the person is the most secure way of delivery.
2.  **Its Simple and Efficient.** It literally takes less than 5 minutes to use RapidFire.  How much time would you estimate its going to take for you or your staff to prep the USBs and or paper wallets.  
3.  **It's Secure.**  We recommend setting up a separate Coinbase account for marketing purposes.  Since we use the Coinbase API, you can then safely enable the Coinbase API Key for the "*marketing account*" and your main account remains secure.
We'd be happy to help walk you through this process if you have any further questions.  PM me we''ll get you set up.

If you expectation is that by accepting bitcoin your restaurant will be overrun with new customers paying in bitcoin you will most likely be disappointed.
However if you take the attitude that you like all the benefits of bitcoin and are willing to invest a small amount of energy educating your customers about WHY you are accepting them, you can expect that more people will pay you in bitcoins because they trust you and your business and want to see you succeed.

hmmmm,.....Give this one a try.

Depends on how many friends/family you're sending to.
If its just a couple, Coinbase will work just  fine.  
If you have a large number of people you want to send BTC to check out **RapidFire for Coinbase**.  It was designed for bitcoin merchants to set up their customers with bitcoin wallets.

I am a committed bitcoin advocate, however, the expectation that more merchants directly translates to more transactions is hopeful at best.
Just because we build it doesn't ensure they will come.  
IMHO merchants are the key to bitcoin's success but they will need to do more than just sign up for a Coinbase/BitPay account and place "bitcoin accepted here" logos on their websites.
The piece that is missing is consumer EDUCATION, which leads to consumer ADOPTION which in turn leads to TRANSACTIONS.
Here's our post on **Bitcoin Merchant Evangelism.**

Awesome.  Now tell your friends and other customers.  
Help them set up a wallet and shoot them a few satoshis in less than 2 minutes using RapidFire for Coinbase.
Spread the word.

These two precautions should be taken in the normal course of business, but **ESPECIALLY** if you do decide to buy bitcoins online.
1.  Make sure your **computer virus protection** is updated and **ALWAYS** turned on especially if you plan on accessing any online services.
2.  **DO NOT** open emails or attached files from unknown senders.
Good luck and welcome to the bitcoin economy.

Good list.  Would you include Bitcoin Merchant Evangelism in your list?

Another service you can offer to your business clients after setting them up to accept bitcoins is to help them get more of their customers to purchase via bitcoins.  
Helping your clients set up their customers with wallets and a few satoshis will "prime the pump" and get more customers into the economy....leading to more publicity and word of mouth marketing.

Hello from Southern California. 
Congratulations on accepting Bitcoins.
Getting patients to pay you in Bitcoins will take a little bit of effort.
Most of your customers probably don't have a bitcoin wallet or any bitcoins yet.
You can help them set up a bitcoin wallet and give them a few bitcoins to get them warmed up to the idea.
We've built a tool called RapidFire for Coinbase to help you do just that. Here's the link. 
When you email your patient base a small amount of bitcoins to use at your office, that will help make Bitcoin a success in your practice.
Let us know if you need any assistance.
Happy Holidays!

The simple solution if you are going to use a 3rd party application is to create a separate Coinbase account and ENABLE that API KEY, keeping your main account key DISABLED.  
Fund the new account with ONLY what you need the 3rd Party Application to do.  
In this recommended scenario, your main wallet remains as secure as Coinbase is secure.....make sense?
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:44:26
We agree with you that in order for Bitcoin to thrive, the user base needs to grow.
We'd also suggest that if Bitcoin use by consumers is to grow (vs. hoarding for investment purposes) that Bitcoin Merchants play a key role in educating their customers and helping them adopt the technology.  
Afterall, Merchants stand to gain financially (in the form of reduced transaction fees) if their customers use Bitcoins vs. traditional credit card/paypal fees.
Merchants have trusted relationships with customers that allows them to communicate the benefits of Bitcoin as a payment mechanism.
We like to call this Merchant Bitcoin Evangelism (MBE).  To help merchants with evangelism, we created a tool called RapidFire for Coinbase.  
RapidFire for Coinbase enables merchants to email their customer list an invitation to create a wallet and receive their first bitcoins.  
More info on RapidFire for Coinbase can be found here.
We invite you to check it out.  Happy New Year!

For Bitcoin to thrive, Bitcoin enthusiasts need to support each other.  I'll shoot you a PM.  
We'd also suggest that if Bitcoin use by everyday consumers is to grow (vs. hoarding for investment purposes) that Bitcoin Merchants must play a key role in educating their customers and helping them adopt the technology.
In this respect while trying to find new customers from the Bitcoin community, here's our argument for why Merchants should be focused on converting their existing customers to Bitcoin users.
1.  Means.  Merchants already have trusted relationships with customers and have the ability to communicate the benefits of Bitcoin as a payment mechanism whether that is in person or via email.
2.  Motive.  Merchants stand to gain financially (in the form of reduced transaction fees) if their customers use Bitcoins vs. traditional credit card/paypal fees.
3.  Opportunity. Bitcoin has been huge in the press this year.  This is the perfect opportunity for merchants to reach out to customers and share with them why they are accepting Bitcoins.   
Merchants have means, motive and opportunity to educate their customers.  We like to call this Bitcoin Merchant Evangelism or BME for short.  
Shameless plug:  We truly believe merchants are the key.  So to help merchants with evangelism, we created a tool called RapidFire for Coinbase.  RapidFire for Coinbase enables merchants to email their entire customer list with an invitation to create a Bitcoin wallet and receive their first bitcoins in less than 5 minutes.
More info on RapidFire for Coinbase can be found here: 
Think what would happen if every Coinbase (16,000) and BitPay (15,000) merchant were to bring in just 24 new Bitcoin users in 2014 (2 per month).  The effect on the bitcoin economy would be huge.  
Bitcoin Merchant Evangelism.  Happy New Year!

Total Score - The total score is used to determine the overall rank.
Overall Rank - The overall rank is the aggregate rank across all responses, determined by the total rank.
The total score is a weighted calculation. Items ranked first are given a higher value or "weight." The score is computed for each answer option is the sum of all the weighted values. This total score is computed using the number of columns.
In the report, because there are 7 options, the weighted sum for an option that was placed in the first position (1) would be worth 7, second position (2) would be worth 6, etc.
The formula for computing the total rank for each answer option is:
Total Responses x Weight
Rank 1 Count x 7 = 
Rank 2 Count x 6 =
Rank 3 Count x 3 =
+ Total Score (Answer option)
All answer options were randomly displayed to each respondent.

The data will hopefully provide insights into Bitcoin owners as consumers.  
For example, as of this post, we have received over 450 complete responses.  It probably would not surprise anyone to know that 84.7% of respondents have NEVER made an in-person Bitcoin transaction.  As we track this statistic over time we have a better understanding of Bitcoin as an in-person form of currency.
