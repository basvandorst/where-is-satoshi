I've been eyeballing the fluctuation and hoping for low 14's and finally jumped when it hit 14,4.... But of course my .1348BTC is already in the red and it seems it'll dip into the 13's before Monday.
Fuck I should've waited just a tad longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:56:27
Tried getting in at 14,4 but by the time my transaction went through it registered at 14,6. Not bad for just starting. But then for the following hour I was in the red and trying not to wig out.  
Then last night I dreamt that it dropped below 10 and surprisingly I wasn't freaking out about my initial investment, rather trying to find a way to scrounge every last penny to buy at such a crazy awesome low. 
Either way, I'm in it for the long haul.

Same can be said about the 80% of "OMG HODL" shitposts by idiots that call themselves crypto veterans after downloading Coinbase when it became the  app. And this is coming from someone who's only been here two weeks...it's hard to not notice, not to mention the ridiculous lambo/insert supercar memes after buying .0001BTC.
At least a post like this is actual insight into how someone is handling their newfound wealth.

Damn that's awesome.

Watched for it and sunk $2k when it was at the lowest 14 in days, only to see it drop to high 13...I was losing my shit! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:21:10
This needs to be highlighted more. Too many people think the opposite, by not pushing cryptos due to the possible millions made, it's breaking his fiduciary responsibility. That's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:24:56
Holy shit, the avg cc debt is $15? What. The fuck.  
That's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:09:37
Don't forget about the wire xfer fee though. Usually $10 but there's may also be a fee from your bank, upwards of $25, which means a $100 wire xfer just cost $35 bucks. Plus whatever transactions fees you would also be paying when you actually buy the crypto. 
These figures aren't concrete, so don't quote me, just getting out the info regarding fees.

No shit. First time buyer, watched like a hawk for low 14 since it hasn't hit that in days and figured it wouldn't dip into 13. Snatched .1348BTC only to watch my first purchase be in the red not 2 minutes later. I can't imagine having THOUSANDS into this. You would have to delete the apps, and not log into your accounts if you wanna stay sane. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:04
14,6. Right there with ya bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:21
You're.... You're not serious are you? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:26:51
Awesome, appreciate the info thank you. Made a really noob mistake in buying LTC with my checking account instead of my tied debit account which is instant...now I'm waiting until the 15th for it to post. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:58:01
I'm learning this the hard way. Been watching for several days and hoping to see low 14 and when I did, I made my first BTC purchase. But I keep checking Coinbase and I'm already in the red as it hit high 13 just a little bit ago.

Oh man, that would be pretty awesome! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:23:46
Yes! As in 42 of them.

Oh no I understand different point entirely, I was simply adding to. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:19
Thanks man, fingers crossed it's steady the rest of the weekend, especially with the futures options. 
I can't imagine people who have thousands if not well into hundreds of thousands seeing a drop like that...fucking nerves are shot over here lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:19
I kept watching and hoping for the lowest 14k it's been in days, and when it did I jumped at the chance to get my first fraction of a BTC. But as soon as I did, of course it appears it'll hit 13's for the first in days.... I gotta stop looking at Coinbase ugh!

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:04
Awesome thank you for the response, I really appreciate it. I'll look into Green Address and Trezor (along with Ledger Nano S) keeps popping up for wallet options, so perhaps I'll look into those as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:46:03
That's what I find particularly funny about people who poke fun at that statement. If you're starting a business, or getting into real estate or taking a calculated risk etc but need funds, a million dollars could be gone in an instant or sometimes not even enough. It's all relative. I feel as though anyone who is irritated by that quote is so stuck in their own self loathing and filled to the brim with a "poor me," attitude is ridiculous.  
We get it. A million dollars is more than you ever dreamed of. Now go back to your corner and keep crying.

Weren't futures options available late Sunday, early Monday? How much of an impact can this availability on Thursday have on BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:10:43
When I first got the bug I was having trouble getting verified, so I ended up trying to create an account anywhere I could. I now have a GDAX, Kraken and Coinbase account that oddly enough verified at about the same time, even though GDAX &amp; Coinbase threw errors for days.
All that to say, I can't take looking at anymore than the 1 app I'm using. It's already a gut check to be in the red after sinking my first $2k into this.

People keep missing this point, on top of confusing net worth with cash he has lying around. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:18
Now if you do that, I assume you have your coins in a wallet (hot /cold etc)? I'm new to this and not sure how to get my recently purchased BTC/LTC (using Coinbase) to a wallet or something more secure(?). 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:47
I was hoping for a slight dipp to buy my first BTC and it hadn't hit low 14's for close to 2 days, so when it did I finally bought some. Of course as soon as I did, we see it dip into the 13's for the first time in days... I gotta stop looking at Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:03
FECK!! I bought in at $14,6, minus whale hodl until I'm broke! Damnit. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:51:03
Ya I knew there would be fees with Coinbase, just didn't pay attention to the specifics, and honestly it's not a big deal for me, at least not big enough for me to require something other than Coinbase. I do have a GDAX and Kraken account, so maybe I'll mess with those when I'm more familiar with their layout. The Coinbase app really does make it dummyproof, and for a complete newbie like me it's welcomed.
Now I need to figure out a wallet option. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:14
Too late, already used Coinbase for my first purchase and it's pending deposit into my account. Though I will say a $19 dollar fee was a bit unexpected...oh well. I also have a Kraken account but that would've taken too long to xfer money into for this transaction, thus my snap decision using the app conveniently tied to my checking account. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:29:41
Really dumb question, and I understand you don't have control until it clears and it's in your account. But you still have that coin (fraction of one or whatever amount you purchased) right? Not to spend, rather if you bought 1 BTC and it skyrockets but hasn't cleared, that doesn't matter right? You still had that BTC from the transaction date right? Does that make sense? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:44:25
I have the transaction coming out of a checking account which means it'll be days before the coin is actually available. I have no choice but to do nothing especially when I made my first purchase at 14,6 (hadn't been that low in days) only to watch it drop into the 13's.... Ugh this is nerve wracking.

What that a loan of million dollars is small, or he didn't get a small loan of a million dollars? 
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:09:57
Wouldn't take bigger balls to risk the trade tho? Hodling is as easy as not checking reddit or whatever site you use for crypto.
