The code for that page is open-source and the link to its repository is available at the bottom of the page. Once you're comfortable using it, what people do is they download a copy(it works without connecting to the internet), and they run it on an offline computer or linux live cd.

That's the way to do it!
First of all, if you don't need the money, there's no reason to realize your loss. All my bitcoin could go to 0 tomorrow and I wouldn't miss any rent, gas, food, fun, tuition payments, etc. I also have an emergency fund and an auto-witheld 401k contribution. Would I be upset? Yes. Would I economically suffer? No. 
Second of all, if you need the money, why the hell did you put money you need in bitcoin? The price of BTC is going to rise and fall unpredictably every month. 
While will tell you to stay the hell away from anything bitcoin or otherwise exciting(high risk/reward) to do with money, I recommend anyone follow their basic advice on having your finances in order.

If you're a US citizen, good luck with that. You can live in Somalia and still owe taxes to the IRS if you make above a certain amount( somewhere above $90k IIRC). Before you can renounce your citizenship, you also have to go through a painstaking process where you list all your assets and pay off any taxes you would have had to pay up to the point of your renunciation.

OP, assuming you have bitcoin already, an android phone, and a printer, here's how to create and monitor a paper wallet in less than a 5 minutes. I recommend you go through the process of storage and retrieval once with $1 or something, and once you get comfortable you can store more on a new paper wallet. 
1. Go to  and move your mouse around to generate a bitcoin address. Go to paper wallet, and hit print. 
2. Download the Mycelium wallet app for android. Blockchain also works, but we're keeping it simple and fast: the blockchain app needs registration whereas mycelium doesn't. With the app open, swipe to the left, click on the key icon, and scan the bitcoin address from the left side of the paper wallet. You have now added a WATCH-ONLY address to mycelium. 
Congrats, now whenever you send money to that address, your balance will show up in mycelium. Go ahead and use your regular wallet to send $1 to this address. It doesn't matter if your phone is hacked or stolen. Without the private key, this balance is untouchable! If you want to withdraw the balance of your paper wallet, scan the PRIVATE KEY, from the right side of your paper wallet, and the balance will be spendable.

Taxes on cryptos are like speed limits, everyone's breaking them a little bit and they're just there so they have something to nail you on if they feel like it. Did you pay your state taxes on every online purchase you made this year?

He didn't say it best, that's a very short-sighted comment. The smartphone market is saturated and relies on repeat customers. These guys are making a statement that they won't buy any more apple products. As a MacBook and iPad owner, I sure as fuck won't. They may already have my money for these products, but they won't get any more hundreds from me.

I'm comfortable with paper wallets but I agree. Bitcoin needs to be Apple-simple so that any layperson can reasonably secure their money.

I've been enjoying my discount BTC. As always, don't put more money in BTC than you can afford to lose. Go read some horror stories on bitcointalk about people who lost everything from Gox and learn from their hard lessons. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:26:17
Wow, those are some "kill yourself" amounts of money being reported. Why would you hold so much money in there?

To be fair, that attitude has actually been pretty consistent for a year and longer. You may think it's coming from nowhere, but it was here on reddit and on bitcointalk. Of course, your anecdote is a very legitimate problem. People who were just getting into BTC were misled because when they read the wiki or searched on google; they were being directed to Gox. After all, they're a business and they do advertising and search engine optimization. One thing that annoys me about a lot of bitcoin advocates is their disregard for making things novice friendly; they're turning bitcoin into linux. Luckily, you dodged a bullet.

Umm don't they have an incentive not to reach 51% anyway? There's so much hype leading up to the attack that the market would crash. What are they going to do when they double spend, cash their phony btc in for the pennies they'll be worth? 
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:14:36
They're a company that's 
 
 
* Run by a scammer convicted for running a mail scam 
 
 
* A company that doesn't even bother paying it's taxes on time. See the history tab:   
 
 
So we have proof that they're incompetent, and no proof that they're malicious except that they're run by a known malicious person. Basically the people who got their units are saying " I got my equipment on time, so 'quit bitching" oblivious to the fact that they could just have easily been the ones who lost their money and didn't get their units or got them super late.

The proliferation of cell phones and the future ubiquity of Bitcoins bypasses all of that. You're thinking in terms of practicality in your daily life, as someone in a first world country where banks compete to offer you free checking. In the third world cell phones are more prevalent than cars and computers. Once crypto is accepted enough the people with wallet capable phones will just trade by phone in village shops. I've spent time in poor parts of Central America and everyone has a cell phone, all prices are haggled, and stores are overall less formal. Cryptocoins fit that need much more nicely than fiat does. In a world with bitcoin ubiquity, you could operate with two monetary systems or both.

My order was placed around 10PM PST last saturday, which means it had a full business week and this weekend to post. I also made an "instant" buy two days ago that hasn't credited either. I haven't received any notification that there's something wrong with my account, my identity is verified, I have the funds, etc. Luckily I only made small purchases(250 millibits total), but if I were depending on a larger sum of money I'd be anxious right now. I really hope this is just growing pains from your startup. I really want you guys to be awesome and ahead of all the others.

The thing is even people in areas with poor infrastructure have cell phones. More people have cell phones than cars or computers. In some poor parts of Africa prepaid cell phone minutes are used as a bartering medium. A few years down the line those phones will be replaced with wallet-capable phones.

I waited 11 days for my btc. It wasn't until I wrote a message saying I was going to dispute with my bank that I got my BTC within the hour. I felt bad about it the whole time.
