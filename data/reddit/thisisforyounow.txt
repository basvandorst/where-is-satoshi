making sure this gets visibility for those interested in the hunt. seems like it will take a good bit longer for these less traveled cities. good luck.
.1 btc on nfc tags at 3 locations in the US
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:20:48
if you read up on the previous hunts in my post history it should give you a good idea what to do. good luck.
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:04:53
all specs now posted. check the new category. if automod gets it again then will rethink the whole thing.

this account has been in existance for a long time.  no idea why it says five day redditor.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:42:14
lets start with the public addresses.
i have to warn you all that the tags could be gone by the time you get there and i reserve the right to be capricious.  the cities are holbrook az, palm desert ca, and albquerque nm.  if you live in one of those cities stand by for further instructions.
last time i was asked to put these tags in the middle of nowhere. hope this meets the criteria.
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:33:28
you can add to the public addresses but no guarantee.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:55:31
i am starting a new bitcoin treaure hunt. looks like my first post was automoderated so you wont have the detail for a bit. same techniques and objectives as last time.  look at my post history for an idea of what to do.
if the post remains moderated i will either post here or find a better venue.  this will be three locations with .1btc each. if things go well i will add a 4th, or not 8-).
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:38:42
i am indeed.  let me try to post one more time.  i will post all three simultaneously.  lets say an extra .02 btc for pics of the winners.  and the first to claim with a pic gets .05.
these are out of the way locations as was requested last time.
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:34:13
that wont help you find the nfc tags.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:30:10
i love PA and it is not too far at all.   central may be a bit of a detour but not hug3e
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:01:43
no idea about mycelium with nfc. all done by hand. any tag reader should work. just utf8 encoded text field.  
would not worry about interference with apps.  nfc for payment is writing.  you are reading.
just get a tag reader.  read the text field and copy it to a wallet.  pivate keys seem to work everywhete.  
i should be more helpful but very busy.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:00:42
added .05.   within 36 hours will likely move them as the game must progress.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:10:39
looks like you are back.   lets see how global we can be.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:28:39
probably the best attitude to have. there will be a next time.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:20:24
you make me happy. the connections between us was what i hoped for.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:36:45
already happening in Korea.  expect more.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:12:18
need to go to more places.   do love SAn diego so you will see me again.
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:24:55
sure.  
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:51:13
Clue: Barking
Clue: out of sight
Clue: a public space
Clue: near the end
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:04:39
Last clue for a while.   I am leaving.  If you are looking down at the barking you are doing it proper.    There are great locations for observation.    No contortions, special abilities, danger, or gymnastics required.
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:01:23
the sticker is black and circular.  I am unwilling to give too much specific beyond he park. check your tech function?
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:36:11
not yet...
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:31:37
the knee of the s curve or is it the ankle? 8-).   the countdown clock is right twice a day.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:17:27
santa cruz and santa barbara too.   santa barbara was a dud tho.  had to move the santa barbara bits to the museum.   someone is going to have a great weekend.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:24:27
that is quite likely.  just happened to start in california.   there are many states and countries to go  
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:06:03
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:29:51
go today, i dont think anyone found it yet   in the least you may see something new and fun.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:33:23
you would think i planned it.   but not really.   things just worked out that way.   this is going to be a fun weekend.   i wish i could have stayed to watch
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:19:36
you should scan first if you can, then take the sticker if you want to try for a picture that will net you more.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:26:31
will give more time but not a lot.   you should grab it tonight.  i might be surly tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:02:28
i love you too.  this is why i do this.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:59:12
congratulations next site is almost prepared!
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:37:09
still not claimed.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:56:08
it was found.  in theory we will see an announcement from the winner soon.
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:04:23
looks like i just confirmed the bench so yes, under a bench.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:56:39
found... winner to announce themselves
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:24:07
i stand corrected.   just my mental model interfering with my correct use of terms.  8-)
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:22:32
tomorrow morning i might.  
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:31:54
It has only one text field on there.   Don't click links? Download a good nfc app
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:04:28
looks like lost...  will have to make the final destination a big deal.  next time.  sorry santa barbara
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:24:26
did you leave it there? throw away?
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:35:34
looks like the field is still wide open for palisades.   it is a small park you need no more clues Next stop tomorrow.

i believe when it leaves the wallet
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:29:44
On the move to the next destination.   If may take time to check in.
The tag is disk shaped and has one sticky side.   It is on the top railing and very thin.   Could be mistaken for an old layer of gum.  It will feel different than the railing.  Sort of slick.  I found no gum while placing.  maybe not so gross.  Really hope someone finds.   Possibly removed by someone who did not know.   Placed on bottom to prevent such from happening.
Good luck all.   I will be placing more.

@_date: 2017-06-30 20:52:43
looks like it was found.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:37:40

If this is not collected by tomorrow then adding to big prize for the last stop in california.

@_date: 2017-06-26 23:59:22
not sure if trolling.   
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:14:48
well it will leave the wallet soon then.   if the other person doent take it I will just move it.   would prefer to see people announce so may move regardless.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:28:23
not giving anything away when i say i like the cut of your jib but i might not have been as thoughtful.  
agree with your thoughts on significance.   what a great way to end the hunt. when i saw the museum it was very inspirational and i thought others would appreciate.   felt bad about the paywall but really wanted it to end in a contemplative way.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:40:11
clue: less than 4 feet from the floor
spend some time reading the other treasure hunt threads.   it will probably help.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:06:08
The exact right crowd for paranoia I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:22:44
you deserve it.

looks like Santa Barbara is not going to happen. next one is going to be large.
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:32:50
Giving back is fun.  I love bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:13:45
all, will leave it till this afternoon.   I left this morning and wont be able to physically verify the tag.   funds still seem to be there though.
@_date: 2017-06-27 01:04:08
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:31:25
Next time I will try to go nowhere.   There is more to come!
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:48:37

@_date: 2017-06-30 20:47:34
