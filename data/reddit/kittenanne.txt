It doesn't help that I only learned about reddit last year.. so yes it is a poor representation of my lifeas a whole ... 
I am very appriciative actually that you were willing to take the time to open my eyes to what I was missing...   it is so hard to see outside yourself. 
  even if I can't see a way to change this impression, it is good to have that knowledge

You didn't have to do that - I know that sometimes things show up at different times depend on relation to server and all that fun stuff....

I am working on it - there is a lot of information.
And I love that - it is nice when those kinds of things mean something :)

Reddit Karma points?  
Oh boy more places to explore.
Nah the short of it - my main hang out is over on Random Acts of Amazon - and it is big on community even more so than the gifting.  But I have been gifted or as the person said got 'free stuff' - but in the last most there has been some issues like emergency home repairs, some health issues etc - that completely wiped out the finances - so to make sure my girls get something under the tree - I signed up for Random Acts of Christmas  and so I am begging for more free stuff I guess ... 
So nope not character assassination - but the desire to have my girls not think they are 'bad' because Santa couldn't get them anything.  Oh and getting 'free stuff' so this probably annoyed them too ;)

I have no clue how to ninja edit - but thanks for verifying that I wasn't imagining it when it was showing on my screen it was a few minutes earlier :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:39:13
:)  Well thank you ... and most likely the downvotes have nothing to do with this in particular - they have been following me for the last 4 days or so :)   It makes them feel good I guess...

It is similar to the speech given I think by Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven  if I remember correctly

as I said no worries - I just thought I was a bit insane ;)

hmmm  on my screen I was 3 minutes before him - but no biggie ;)

For those of you tipping - Thank you so much not just the big tippers but the small ones as well -
I was just introduced to this and it is very exciting to me!
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:43:46
LOL maybe I shouldn't have been so specific :) 
Nah it isn't that big of a deal :)

First let me thank you for being more than willing to let me know what others are seeing and thinking.    When it is anonymous downvotes, I have no clue.
I did work over the summer, And I have worked off and on when I can find jobs that will work with my school and volunteer schedule as well as my practicum for school.  I had saved that money to the side for Christmas not just for my family but because I wanted to be able to gift as well.    Several things came up that had to be dealt with to remain where we were which completely wiped out my savings.  
My partner has a friend that does Ebay sales - and we have handed her all my Xena Collectables - about 10 swords and about 50 DVDs to sell for us.  If she doesn't get them listed in the next week, I am going to talk to my partner to get the stuff back and try to figure out how to do the ebay thing.
As far as the Random Acts of Amazon - That sub is very community oriented.  I have made friends there and enjoy hanging out.  I have tried other subs and it seems that they are less friendly.  Maybe that has something to do with the type of people willing to gift strangers and those that don't?  But I have talked to people in much more detail about some of the things that are going on, and listening to the advice they give.  
TL:DR - Thank you for telling me how this looks from the outside.  This was a lot more informative than the short comment from the throwaway account.

oh now I see what I did! LOL 
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:43:52
Because these imaginary internet points are sooooo useful in life :) 
I felt bad for a second - I talked to my friends - they said the downvoters were silly - one made a throwaway account to 'explain' how horrid I am - my friends laughed at them and the person ran away and deleted the throwaway - but is still down voting - 
And all it did was reassure me that I made good online friends :)
