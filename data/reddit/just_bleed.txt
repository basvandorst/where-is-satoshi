I know a guy who dropped his life savings (like 30k) into crypto a few months ago. It’s already worth over 200k. The way I see it, I can sit around nervous and stay broke or you can join the party. Worse case scenario I lose everything and I’m back where I started... broke

If this is even real, You need to tell your wife. that’s kind of the point of marriage. Two become one. Everything you own is hers and everything she owns is yours. 
After that pay cash for a house and pay off all your debt. All of it.  You would be a fool not to.

Fees are unimportant? I thought low fees were one of the primary reasons to use crypto over fiat.

Yeah there are many reasons but one major reason is low fees. Coinbase wants like $10 to send .05 btc to my ledger wallet. Insane

If that were so easy we would all be millionaires. Timing the market is impossible
