Good for them. Thanks for the info.

How would the dark web pay for the electricity bills of a mining farm?
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:14:57
Heard of it but for some reason I have never experiment with it. Do you have any experience with it? If yes would you recommend it? (I care mostly about security and privacy than ease of use)
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:25:19
Ok. Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:30:03
Yeah. Tell them that when the IRS drags you in the court and let me know the outcome.

Out of curiosity what is the theoretical maximum for the block size? I would imagine that happens when  100% of transaction are from bc1 to bc1 addresses.
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:56:19
Ok. I see. Basically, you say they are responsible for a big part of all sell orders in exchanges.

Why is Spotify and Netflix scarce? They literally sell the same product to millions of users.

I got you. Thanks

I think technifocal gave me the most satisfactory answer. Thank you all for your replies.
I initially thought of this question when I was thinking of why it is so difficult to buy bitcoin while try to avoid any exchanges with KYC policies but at the time the same time, there is a market of miners who want to sell their bitcoin and a market of bitcoin users who want to buy. But I guess this is what exchanges are for to connect sellers and buyers. I just bother me that there is not a better way to acquire bitcoin (truly peer-to-peer with no centralized exchange as an intermediary and less KYC).

Thanks. It's one of the wallets I haven't tried yet. But I was mostly looking for a non-wallet app just for recording purposes.

Ok. But don't you have to own an ASIC miner to mine Bitcoin profitably these days? I would expect that most of the hash power comes from mining farms which is difficult to communicate with directly. Are there still people who mine Bitcoin on their gpu?
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:51:15


Well, that part I figured it out. 
The main point of my question is what is the path of this newly mined bitcoin from miner to mainstream user. They sell to whom? Why don't the sell directly to people who want to buy? Are they the suppliers of exchanges?

Probably referring to coinbase that bought neutrino, a blockchain analytic company. Look at 25:35 of this video

I can see that being true for a small scale miner. Big scale miners (mining farms) need to get millions in dollars to pay their electricity bill each month. Therefore they have to sell some of their bitcoin for fiat. They can't just hodl or just spend it for goods and services.


What do you mean? If you are a mining farm the whole point of mining is profit.
@_date: 2018-06-02 20:01:04
Ok. Thanks for the info.

I don't see how the transaction will reach the miners without internet.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:56:47
But the post says they use no internet/3G/text/call.

As it says in the link you sent, the satelite only broadcast the blockchain. It can't receive transactions and even if it could you would need a special antena to broadcast. As I understand the satelite will facilitate one way comunication between nodes allowing people to keep their nodes updated even without internet access.
Let me know if i missed anything.
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:56:09
Thanks technifocal. That makes sence. But I thought this technology was developed as a responce to a countywide internet ban in Zimbabwe. If that is true and your description is accurate then it means that the transaction should be breadcasted beyond country borders before it touches the internet.

... he said while running a business that sells bitcoin under $10 k all the time.
@_date: 2019-09-28 12:24:50
Well technically they are the intermediaries of a fiat to btc transaction. But still they sell btc.
