I am convinced that the maximum block should be increased however during all this scrutiny I question if we should also reexamine the 10 minute block time.  I do not have a problem with it, however I do wonder if a 2.5 or 5 minute blocktime would be beneficial with possibly an increase in the maximum block size.  As far as I see things, we can either increase the block size or decrease the time to mine a block.  While I know that most people think every 10 minutes is plenty, I would like to bring up the idea of shortening the time to mine each block as I feel this concept has not been examined enough by the bitcoin community.

Please note some previous discussion in related to this idea around a year ago:

Did you mean first 1 million mined bitcoins in the first year?  1 million mined blocks would imply over 50 million coins mined during the first year.

So what would be a large volume?   I do not believe that 6000 coins a day (in a single exchange detached from other exchanges at the time) is a tiny fraction such that it can be dismissed.  Who knows though...  In another sense, if each coin purchase at ask price represents 0.01% of price increase then it does become a big number.  When playing with the math, how much lift would you give each singular btc purchase - 0.01% of a $100 purchase is just a penny by the way.
