That's pretty fucking insane. I don't really know how I feel about that lol.

Last I checked Microsoft and steam (but I heard that was click bait idk) are both pretty large companies so their effect on a market would be visible if not then present. However seeing as how you are from you clearly know best. That does beg the question though. Why have you just been putting people down and saying their wrong rather than actually giving an explanation? Clearly someone is uniformed in this matter and I never made any claims. Almost everything I've addressed to you has been a question or a point that I'm willing to argue. Instead of giving me a proper response you just immediately resort to putting others down.
Now that we have that out of the way. Can you give me a proper response as to if my information/deduction as correct, and if not why are they wrong. Or are you gonna keep being a child?

Shouldn't news like this cause bitcoins value to deteriorate?

As I said to someone else that seems pretty insane but from what I've been reading it seems almost true. That's pretty fucking weird tbh.

Thanks for that thoughtful and helpful reply /s
I think it works similar to stocks where the value can be affected by changes in its support and popularity but it is also affected by convince. If companies stop supporting it I feel like it will drop off in value.
How it actually works... I have no fucking clue that's why I'm asking.
