I agree Mt. Gox is still establishing itself as an exchange, however for US citizens it seems to be the best option if you can get through the verification process.
I would sell my beer for bitcoin if I legally could. It would currently be considered bootlegging :-)

Im  curious as to where you are going with this... It seems like you already have a concept in mind.
Personally I like to have a second computer set up on my desk and I play videos as they are available.  Payout is small but over time it does add up (I call it my "interest" building)

The calculator is interesting.  I would love to see 5% of the world population using BTC!

DONT use any exchanges originating from China or Hong Kong....if you are in US.  If you are looking to buy try LocalBitcoins

Western Union type businesses. Money Transfer services, etc. will be obsolete.

microBit      nanoBit     picoBit     femtoBit    attoBit  .Personally I think that once BTC reaches $100,000 or more after a few years it will be necessary have terms to describe the fractional amounts.  I've already been calling uBC "microbits"

Thanks for the Tip! I currently have a half barrel pilot system that I use to test and perfect my recipes.  I will be posting soon on the system and the vision. I would like to start with a 15 barrel system with and step it up to 30 barrels within the first 7 years.  
Thanks again and cheers!

Well, you aren't SUPPOSED to buy guns or drugs with BC. But then again you aren't SUPPOSED to buy guns and drugs with Dollars, or Euros, or Yen or even shiny little rocks. Anything that has value can be used to buy illicit items.
