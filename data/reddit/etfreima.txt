Look into rbf or cpfp
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:28:47
Wow, are you Satoshi nakamoto???????!
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:42:03
yeah, the transaction that was stuck was to a Ledger, after the original dropped, I bit the bullet and did a higher fee tx, which went through within a few hours
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:33:42
Yeah, actually, it took about 3 weeks for it to finally show as dropped on breadwallet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:09:44
All alts are shit
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:15:35
I want a high pitch screech every time the market moves $5
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:40:21
What was your fee?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:10:34
Or be a man and use arch...

obv troll
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:11:38
I haven't used electrum. I believe it's desktop as well as mobile.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:19:29
Only you can decide that. The price may go up dramatically, and it may go down dramatically. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:05:46
My transaction has been stuck for over a week now. I've sent an email and all I got was an automated response saying to wait. Until this is solved I will continue to tell people not to use bread.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:26:43
Transfer from coinbase to gdax for free, then transfer from gdax to electrum for free.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:43
What kind of id?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:51:06
It is important. My cac card is accepted, but never actually went through. Once I used my driver's license, it was much easier.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:57:46
I mean, I'm not trying to, I only did 10.1sat/b on my transaction. Didn't expect it to take this long though :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:28:24
Same could happen for fiat, doesn't mean it will.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:16
You think nobody cares about $1k?!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:09:16
Lol okay

Quick mafs
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:11:16
Eventually it won't be, in its current form. Though that eventually, when the 21mil is hit and we lose most of those coins won't be in our lifetimes. Regardless, if BTC lasts long enough, I'm sure a system will pop up to fix this.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:08:40
Do rbf or cpfp
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:40:35
never said it doesn't. It's just a lot more secure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:12
Don't post your balance

R u ok?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:45
Thanks Dad

MOSS, it's not like you to use that language!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:01:37
Lol, be patient my dude. Hodling isn't about instant gains. If you believe in Bitcoin, hodl, if not, don't.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:28:04
I would look into getting a trezor or ledger if I were you. A bit safer and still pretty convenient. You're definitely holding enough BTC to warrant spending $100 on a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:13:31
My dad works at Bitcoin guys, they're laying off 120 employees. Sad...
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:22:32
whatchu gaining by persistently annoying people with your speculation?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:59:23
Oh no! I'm only up 346%! Woe is me!
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:08:12
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:56
I haven't used either of those wallets, but generally a low fee means it will take longer. Im at 13 days waiting for a low fee transaction. Check your transaction on blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:47:24
Privacy coin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:54:32
Wrong sub?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:04:36
Selling isn't even an option for me till at least 2022
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:05:49
It doesn't net you any financial gain, but you could run a node
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:48
Bold statement
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:35:07
You're making yourself a target by advertising how much money you have
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:22:59
My sincerest apologies sir. I formally introduce myself as the creator of this subreddit. When I made this, I accidentally forgot to mention only fortune tellers are welcome here. Good day sir.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:17:24
Wanna bet? How about, if it's not &lt;$1k on Jan 1st, you eat your left nut? You seem really confident.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:07:44
Depends on your method of payment. Did you use debit/credit, or bank?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:55
You make yourself a target in doing so.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:57:20
So within a year, not this year
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:20:40
Doesn't mean you should be okay with losing money you shouldn't have to lose
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:39:32
You seem confident
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:19:35
Try 2
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:57:09
I'm actually not encouraging anyone to do anything, due to the fact that I'm not omniscient, like you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:22:10
You must be new
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:59
Bro, this is nothing. To put it in perspective, a couple weeks ago it dropped from like $9k to about $5.4k. in 2013 it dropped from $1300 to approx $100.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:42:23
By paying that fee. The network is crazy congested right now. Don't mess with low fee transactions unless you're willing to risk waiting 3 weeks + for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:03:15
Same as you would for yourself. I'd recommend a hardware wallet and give it to him when you want.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:56:14
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:03:08
By selling that Nvidia GPU and using the cash for a down payment on an antminer
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:30:39
Definitely, I'm hodling long term, so I don't really care when it gets confirmed though
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:45:35
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:11:27
So, here's my theory. If you buy now, it might drop, then I guess you have a net loss for like a day or two until it hits $15k. If you wait, it *might* drop, or it might not, then you'll be wishing you bought at $11.7k. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:25:33
It is true, 21 million is the max
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:49:55
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:12
I don't think there's any one specific cause like a bunch of businessmen got a Friday evening off. I would guess more so along the lines of the ever increasing publicity, a couple big buys here and there, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:56:06
Lol, you're really digging there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:37
I agree, though hodl is about the best advice to get right about now
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:50:52

@_date: 2017-12-08 22:00:45
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:25:33
I've been using it for a while and do not recommend it in its current state. New update is all sorts of buggy and it doesn't support rbf
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:53:47
It's been a week for me
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:04:58
EVERYBODY LISTEN! hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:01:34
Are you serious?
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:05:42
What losses?
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:06:06
Whether I am or am not isn't even of concern. You asserted that a drop would happen by New year's. That didn't happen. This is completely ignoring the fact that even a big drop like this can be healthy. Even that is completely ignoring the fact that sometime in October we were at $5000, now we're hovering around $8-10k, which is still crazy growth. Even if it goes lower, I just see that as an opportunity to buy.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:57:53
Fuck it, I'm gonna, only $25 though
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:30:53
 What if his bank is usaa and he doesn't want to expose that he's military?  Calm your tits.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:24:35
I'm still up more than $500, so again, what did you warn me about?
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:39:01
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:13:36
I'm at an astounding 3%!
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:29:31
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:34:37
If they're seeing coinbase transactions tell them you didn't.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:54:42
I'm fairly new as well, but I'm pretty sure nothing will happen. Bread is essentially a bank you're in charge of. Your btc should stay btc no matter what in bread.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:52:13
Then don't hodl
