I just got sick of trying to find a job.

1) You're implicitly (and in all probability, literally) looking down on them.
2) 'Trading' for sex means she doesn't get appropriately compensated.
3) Hookers, at least successful ones, have very finely tuned bullshit detectors. She'd have to be a very special form of stupid to allow a client access to enough real world information for financial transactions, simply because of the possibilities for theft or coercion.
4) Historically, any form of 'trading for services' leaves both parties dissatisfied due to poor performance.

Eros.com, Slixa.com, also, I wouldn't be much of a ho if I didn't promote my own site.
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:16:26
No worries, I caught that when updating my site. Thank you for sharing that with everyone!
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:13:02
The problem is, anonymity is really important for hookers.

Actually just installed Mycelium! 😄

I prefer to be paid upfront, and I require deposits for all of my appointments. I'm also the 1% of whores. The vast majority of us cannot insist upon being paid up front, the clients are simply too afraid of their money being taken and ran off with, and with some of the scams on Backpage, who can blame them?
@_date: 2015-07-02 09:10:35
They take both of those.

Please don't try to offer advice to hookers and then ask for a discount. It's offensive and it'll get you blacklisted.
Oh, and believe it or not, we're not all bloody morons...
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:29:44
Not really.

So, my original idea for a startup was to create BTC denominated debit cards instantly exchangeable for USD - this would be the most seamless solution, but there are serious legal issues associated that resulted in the startup fizzling out.
It's more awareness than anything, the industry will have moved on in three months.

Woo, so, chiming in as a hooker here...
The average hooker on Backpage isn't competent enough for Bitcoin right now, and I'm seriously worried that low-end sex workers are going to be pushed out onto the streets because they don't have the resources to operate with Coinbase.
The smart hookers aren't on Backpage in the first place. I tried putting out a 101 level post on being a ho using Bitcoin, but I'm certainly not an expert.

There are better directories - Eros.com is the predominant one - but I'm very hesitant to recommend any of the review boards in the U.S. simply because they cater to sexual predators.
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:00:01
Yeah, I'm going to totally start taking payments with another wallet rather than directing them at my Coinbase account. Don't want to get shut down. =x

Speaking as a call girl here...


No. No. No.
Do not 'tax and regulate' it.
We don't want legalization. We want decriminalization.
You know what 'tax and regulate' will do?
It means $500 hooker license bills every year that are public record so everybody knows you're a ho. Don't buy the license? Guess what, you're still a criminal.
It means having weekly STI tests 'just in case' you get an STI between the clients of one week and the next, despite employing mandatory safe sex practices. Can't afford the weekly STI tests because you're a drug addled streetwalker? Guess what, you're still a criminal.
It means not being allowed to see a client within x distance of schools. Some areas are so dense that sex offenders, people already banned from being within x distance of schools, are forced to live far away from metropolitan areas. See someone in a hotel in the wrong area? Guess what, you're still a criminal.
Legalization is bullshit.

Why does anyone need a multisig wallet?
Also... We're not doing retail.
It's just not that complicated.
What edits would you suggest?
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:35:51
Honestly, I was pretty content with Coinbase and being discreet about things. I knew about localbitcoins and that there were other wallets out there, but because my problem was converting BTC back to cash rather than cash to BTC, I needed something attached to bank accounts.

Working on it. The stakes are much higher with running an agency and, courtesy of anti-trafficking hysteria, LE is much more interested in taking down agencies than they are individual hookers, not to mention the issue of it being a much more serious felony versus a misdemeanor if caught.
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:55:53
Having 50 IQ points and a graduate degree on the average hooker doesn't change the fact that we're both still whores.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:21:33
All right, I'll use a different wallet for taking payments!
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:47:53
Bitcoin is never going to replace cash. It can and is beginning to replace credit cards.

Cool. The post is as updated as it's going to get, I'm going to start hammering away at an infographic for distribution later.

So, I'm a shitty excuse for a feminist and have a very nasty habit of conflating intelligence with privilege - apologies - making notes as I go.
@_date: 2015-07-02 01:30:47
Only if they're readily exchangeable for fiat.
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:46:41
Generally lower bullshit tolerance.
In my area, the going rate on Backpage is $200/hr, and the clients generally very pushy.
For comparison, my base rate is $1000/4hrs. Very different kind of clientele, and none of the guys browsing Backpage are going to go for that.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:20:16
Awesome - I'll update my post shortly!
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:24:07
Yes, but you can't exactly sleep with someone over the internet, now can you?

The bulk of my business involves flying across the country to entertain tech executives for anywhere from an overnight to a weekend. Sometimes these guys don't plan ahead and find frustration when they can't instantly take care of everything with a Bitcoin account. This is why I'm overly concerned with processing times.
Receiving them and converting them to cash means Circle/Coinbase. =(
