why does it bother you that people vent about how shitty the price has been of late? I think the real worriers are the people who say "quit whining and crying" because they dont want to be reminded that they are down just as much if not more than everyone else. they are just putting on a front. I am completely out of the game and let me tell you it feels great. I am not getting back in until there is a guaranteed uptrend or we are below $200.Because the way I look at it, Bitcoin investing is flat out gambling and if it doesnt hurt when you lose you aren't betting enough.

I will never be out of bitcoin forever but I will never actually invest a good amount of fiat for the long term unless we get under $200. We are one whale sale away from bitcoin getting crushed. Its going to happen sooner than later. A 5000-10000 or more market sell will send the price to double digits.

are there any red light districts where the rentals are?

market makers will help as they are buyers &amp; sellers of last resort.

Yawn. Nothing new today. Price down. I am not buying back in til we go under $200. Funny how everyone has changed their tune. You don't hear moon anymore, no more buy cheap coins etc. Now you hear buy what you can afford to lose. I love the idea of bitcoin but its a pipe dream if you are waiting for a bubble.

you are gambling remember.

Panic sells will occur around the $310 area where buyers of bearwhales coins set them so at worst they get out even if the shit hits the fan. Might see this scenario this weekend. Get your fiat wired to bank, exchanges etc $250 buy in.

Its been a great year to scoop up cheap coins I thought? After all this isnt a get rich quick scheme right?? Buy now for ten years down the road. Everything will be ok. Just fill them bags with btc so the whales can fill theirs with fiat. 
$300 by the end of the day. HAVE FUN!

 I am not riled I feel great. If the price goes up good, down even better. I have been trading in and out of btc all year to cost average myself out of a perpetually falling price. to get out of this game only down $500 after having bought 30 coins between $700 and $300 and having $15k tied up, I consider it a win in my book. So now that I am out and the price keeps falling I am winning because I still have all my fiat ready to buy cheap. g/l

If bitcoin doubles sell half and let the profits ride. I was a god damn fool for not taking my profits off the table earlier this year and that is the reason I am out of the game. Had a $400 cost average at $600 a few months ago and watched all that money go right into the whales pockets.   Only let your profits ride.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:38:00
I would rather tip them with dirty fiat. Why waste good bitcoin on scum of the earth.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:06:02
What do you want to do with it when you get it?
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:41:46
I thought it was clear. The shorts are the only people making money. I am not short but I would not even consider going long until we are under $150.
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:41:52
Shorting is the only way to make money. Im not shorting and I'm not buying either. I will get back in around $100-$150.
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:04:58
Why dont we just do the conversion to bits and still call them bitcoins. And a full bitcoin can be called something else. Bits will not catch on its too late.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:56:23
Its going to take awhile to recover. The problem is institutional size money needs to come in. Everyone that has been holding their bag is selling right into pumps. Short term lower highs. So buying right now don't plan on going much higher than $375 until we are going up for good. I see low $200s maybe lower.
@_date: 2014-11-01 13:35:26
it is a blessing in disguise wait til we hit $250.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:32:36
If bitcoin was rising I would donate. I'm not donating when I am losing money. Like trying to beg at a casino good luck.

@_date: 2014-10-30 12:55:49
Sorry you don't convince me. And until one person can't sell and crush the market no real money will get in. Sorry but this right now is flat out gambling its not investing
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:12:46
coinbase, circle, otc trade. there will always be demand because the price will be going up forever. look at the subscription offer from okcoin/huobi a few months ago, that offered a roi on btc it sold in hours

Why do you want to trade? I would either just go long or short at bitfinex. You can use margin to increase your buying power, but be warned the whales are lying in wait for your fiat. I tried trading and I found out that an ordinary investor has no chance against the whales. They are fully leverage with thousands of coins to rebalance. I shorted about 50 coins on leverage one day and immediately after I put my trade in there were about 300 coins bought to offset my short. I immediately sold for about a $100 loss. and in about 20 min everything went back to the way it was before I placed my trade. So you have no chance. The only way to make money is to catch a wave of buying or selling and get out quickly. Also add into the mix all the exchanges are corrupt. No rules, laws, regulations etc. so you get to trade against the whales and the exchanges have fun bro.

With bitcoin you should cost average down. I bought in the $700+ range at the beginning of the year bought all the way down to the mid $300's. Ended up having a $400 cost average. Dumped most at $375 after the whole bearwhale bullshit and took a $500 loss. I am through with buying and holding and listening to all the shills and bagholders. I actually feel good not holding anymore and watching my hard earned money keep going down day after day. The manipulation is clear as day: lower highs on the pumps to keep you in the game or if you want out you sell at a loss.

GOODNIGHT SWEET BITCOIN! KISS KISS 
@_date: 2014-10-25 23:19:22
 rather than tip toeing around that fact that bitcoin has shit on everyones head over the last year now all the perma bull pumper shills can stfu.

We will be below $288 by next week. No news on the horizon other than a pipe dream of a listing on the stock exchanges. As soon as we get near $300 the panic will start. There are no buyers. 300 coins on bitstamp to $330 look at the order book.
@_date: 2014-10-31 01:57:11
no its just an observation. everyone on here pretty much is either a cocky techy computer geek who lives and breathes  bitcoin, or a dickhead smartass who is here trying to figure a way to get rich and is pissed because they are holding a bag, whatever with bitcoin it isnt happening fast enough for them or they are bleeding fiat out everyday. And the best way for them to get back is to make like everything is going according to plan, just relax and everything will be fine. One big charade,
