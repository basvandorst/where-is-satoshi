You'll never be rich, as no matter how much money you make, you will always envy the guy down the pub who has more.  As you make more money, you'll go to more and more expensive pubs, but there will always be the person who overshadows you.  Making money is great, but spending more time with your family is what counts in the end.  Source: UAE

Jihan's fork will reach 500k in 3 years?  Interesting.

Horrible advice.  Never gamble on credit!

North Korea created Bitcoin.  Satoshi = Kim Jong Un.

Wow.  You must be new to Reddit.  Go exploring enough and you will find things that make look like a staff meeting at the Smithsonian.

Buying now gets you coins on both forks.  Dip is good.

No, if you read his comments down the thread he specifies that it's Jihan's fork he is talking about.

I taught a bunch of pinoy hookers in Hong Kong how bitcoin works for remittances and they were very happy.  It is MUCH cheaper than Western Union, even at $20/tx

you obviously didn't actually read my post.  I am not trying to defend Jihan Wu in any way, I am just saying that calling him 'jihad' makes people look extremely ignorant and childish.

That would be awesome.  Cheap coins!

I second that.  This should come as standard on new Trezor wallets.

They only accept Caligulacoin in the really good clubs though, just a heads up.  Be careful with Valeriancoin though.  I hear Persians react badly to it.

This 'Jihad Wu' stuff is nonsense.  You do know that there is a difference between a Han Chinese guy that lives in Beijing and Wahabi Islam, right?  Just because they are both from outside the USA doesn't make them both the same thing.  Grow up and start acting like an adult in your discourse, if you don't want people to treat you like a child.

If you want to learn more about the charity work the masons do, go talk to them.  They are as prolific as the Rotary club or Lions, but much less prone to self-aggrandisement or advertising.  I have done a lot of charity work myself and met with members of the aforementioned organisations frequently and I assure you your cynicism is misplaced.  Unless you have any proof?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:41:17
Oh yeah, because bitcoin can't be sent over the internet

As Bitcoin grows in popularity worldwide it will attract more and more people who don't give a crap about the founding principles and simply want to make money.   this is an article about the education level of Chinese stock market investors.  People in China will buy whatever is going up, whichever version of Bitcoin that may be, and probably all of them.  Given the conversations I have with most people who dabble in investing, I imagine it won't only be the Chinese with this mentality.  Even though here on R/Bitcoin people love to get on their high horse about the original spirit of Bitcoin and it's founding principles, most people who will need to be buying it to create the acceptance that is a prerequisite  for those principles to mature don't actually give a crap about them.  Kinda like the US constitution, actually.

I know what he does. So in what way does that mean you should be changing his name from 'Jihan' to 'Jihad'?

But all bitcoins aren't available for purchase.  As he bought out the ones that are, the price would skyrocket due to the increase in demand.

This.  Sorry to latch onto a previous comment but keeping your coins safe on a trezor is the  thing to learn, especially with such a large amount.  Coinbase is like the local mall.  You wouldn't keep your stuff in the mall after you buy it, because once it doesn't belong to the shop anymore they will not spend any time or effort protecting it.  When dealing with bitcoin expect others to be incompetent at best, and criminal at worst.
