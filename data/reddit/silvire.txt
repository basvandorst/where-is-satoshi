OP probably didn't in this case.
But it's worth stating that not all pedigrees are bought from a store. 
My current dog is a purebred Yorkshire Terrier with papers going back three generations. My previous dog was a purebred Rough Collie...
Both were rescues!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:34
Yes they can. Not all definitely, or not even most by far. But to say they flat out DONT, that's just wrong.
I personally picked up my rescue from a rescue center, and he has pedigree papers. He was given up by a family because they couldn't handle him.
Rescues don't only mean dogs abandoned on the streets mate. They also include abused dogs, dogs given up by their family, dogs seized due to lack of care, etc.

Absolutely agree.

Not the exact same gains actually. If Bitcoin continues to rise at this rate, she'll get less and less gains (but still gains) because she'll be only able to contribute a fixed sum  every month.

It's not the dog's fault is it?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:47:48
Correct. Except who actually knows what B is?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:10:06
I completely agree with you on that. 
It's just that I wanted to address the statement that it will be the exact same gains, which it won't.
But that said, yes, clearing debt is definitely important jndeed.

I'm not sure for both of your questions.
That said, I don't and can't say that it definitely won't happen.
So what makes you so sure that it can't and won't happen?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:29:16
"We just say it won't happen in the English language."
Not quite true. I'm a native English speaker and honestly, that statement varies from country to country.
Although I reckon our discussion has reached its end, thanks for replying! Have a good one. =)

Question: how are you so certain that you can say "at best" you'll make 5x or 10x more than you invested?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:47:40
Not the original poster you're replying to, but what you just described, "hackers" trying to login to your coinbase account?
That's why hardware wallets exist. If your bitcoin is on an exchange, it's not your bitcoin. 
A hardware wallet can never be hacked except through social engineering, and if we talk about social engineering, everything including online bank account access can be hacked that way.

Good point, completely forgot the puppy bit!
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:47:42
Agreed. To be fair, there's childishness on both sides.
I wish BTC supporters would just called Bitcoin Cash what it is: Bitcoin Cash instead of Bcash.
And I wish BCH supporters would call Bitcoin what it is - Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:05:47
You mean Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Bitcoin and Monero?
Stop misleading people.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:50:26
Ah good God, yes sorry.
I always keep thinking of ETH as Ethereum. Doesn't help when places like CoinDesk and whatnot list it as Ethereum (ETH).

Waghorn the player scored a goal earlier in the game from a penalty kick. Zohore, a player on the other team, scored another goal, also from a penalty kick, in the 84th minute, to equalise the score to 1-1.

As a non-American, I've always found that strange.
In my country, there are zero fees for ATM withdrawals at all, and every bank has at least 1 account you can open and put any amount of moeny at no fee.

I'm neutral on this matter, just for the record. Just wanted to say that your reasoning might not be quite that sound. People shouldn't be fixating on whether the price rose or fell by 2.5k.
You mentioned that if BTC was 2.6k and it dropped 2.5k it's bad. But what if BTC is 100k and drops by 2.5k? Same reasoning, but now it's a mere 2.5% change.
This is why people should be looking at % changes and not pure monetary sum changes.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:15:53
There have been cases of people sending BCH to their BTC address on an exchange though, and vice versa. Since BCH and BTC share the same address format it's possible.
Generally you can recover it if you have your seed but if it's an exchange wallet then it's really up to them.

He's still got slightly less than an hour, hasn't passed yet!

Just got the notification it dropped below $1,000...

Refreshing to see someone agree to a differing opinion. =)

I... Have no idea what in the world went on here...
