Just curious why you think Coinbase is a joke. They seem like a decent wallet to me.

I’m just a small time alt-coin miner auto converting on MPH to BTC. My machine keeps on churning regardless of the price fluctuations. I’m still in the black even with power calculations factored in. As long as that’s the case, I’m grateful for the entertainment value all of this has produced.

I don’t even see an iOS app. How can they appeal to the masses without an app?

If it weren’t for alts, I wouldn’t be able to mine with my SLI setup and convert to BTC.

Couldn’t agree more. This is how I get my notifications of spikes or drops too.

A suspicious lack of orange needles on the ground as well. This is clearly staged.

This is how I feel as well. I’ve made all my BTC from mining altcoins and converting. When the BCH fork happened, I dumped that and bought more BTC, but that was it. I’m wondering now when to pull the trigger on a buy. Maybe 5k.

That Hodlgang video and the pump and dump segment at the end were the highlights for me.

I hope I’m wrong, but I get the impression he’s going to bash it too. I fondly recall the days when his show covered more topics. Now it seems very biased and focused too much on politics.

Gets news from a paid clown. Wonders why they’re misinformed.

It’s on the internet, so it must be true!

Really sad to hear all those plates are going to get banned.
