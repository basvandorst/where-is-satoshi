Via normal bank wire. I've done it before to send money home


I'll know more about this after the first trial and error but I would say there is a high chance that profit can be made


At the moment the difference in the price is about 30%... would say so


~~Korbit has a limit of about $10,000 per day which can be increased to $30,000 with further account checks.~~ Sorry I read that wrong, I will be meeting with the bank to discuss this. I can't see a problem, Bitcoin exchanges are legal in Korea. I can show them where I'm buying and selling.


Yep, realised this when I started reading into to it. Honestly it seemed too good to be true, however the main problem with Korean arbitrage is trust and, an 'in'. At the minute all the foreigners outside the Korean exchanges cannot open an account and if they do they are limited to $50K transfers out of Korea per year. 
Korean natives can transfer out more (I believe, need to talk to the bank about this) but cannot open a bank account elsewhere in the world without an 'in'. 


It's in the wife's name, technically she's selling my bitcoins. That's probably an area that could be a problem but since were married I don't think it's a huge issue. Is there something wrong about me managing my wife's Korbit account?
Thanks for the reply man, really appreciate it.

Sorry for the necro-post, but my wife has an account on Korbit. I have a mate in the EU who will buy and send bitcoins. What's to stop me from taking advantage of this?
