Jus because you are using it that way, doesn't make it right. I can use a crowbar as a back scratcher, it doesn't mean its the intended or most practical use for it.

Pretty much all the time.

Do you hang out with anybody who you know ordered drugs off the dark web a few years ago? Cause I do, and this isn't the most uncommon thing for people who made a purchase and just had leftover in their wallet somewhere when they decided to go strait. Not 'millions' for any of hem, but I'm sure there is a few thousand eacg floating around from plenty of low level pot heads, roiders, candy kids, etc.

You could. But you won't. Because you're more spammy, fake, multiple account trash.

Is an intelligent reply needed for baseless taunts like 'I could teach you a lot of things. you're the new one here, trust me'? 
 You spewed garbage and then get upset that people don't waste time giving rational responses to your garbage? Makes sense.

I've ruined more chances with girls who were interested in me at parties by saying something stupid than I've ever actually dated. I feel like it's similar.

If that was his plan he'd probably wind up broke anyway, even if he got rich off bitcoin.

If anyone asks,  say you messed up and sold at 300 and lament about the amount you could have had if you had just hodl.

Wtf really? Damn and my old accounts I think got deleted when they came out with 3d version.

I know you are, but what am I?

I think I repressed the memory of any emails or usernames I thought of in junior high.

I have made complaints over purchases for things as minor as being an aftermarket instead of an OEM part and generally it's considered false and misleading advertising.

What? That statement is so dumb it hurts. Considering that this isn't how any current currency works, it seems funny you'd think btc would get different rules. Alternatively, you seem to think what is happening is that a person buys an exact amount of USD value in bitcoin and that any negative fluctuation will ruin them. This just isn't how almost anything works, you set a budget and attempt to stay within that budget. 
Yes btc's purchasing power is more volatile from month to month, but ultimately sometimes shit cost more or less and you benefit or don't. Your example sounds like someone who budgeted for $1.90/gallon gas and now it's $2.25/gallon and they are just ruined.

You can typically book plane tickets/hotels/rentals ahead of time. All of these also have their own variability in prices daily- so I'm not sure the situation is significantly different than buying your tickets at a bad time and spending more than they are "really" worth.

To be fair, many people have always used it wrong. 'My phone got stolen and all my info was permanently logged in. I've been hacked! '

Not a dedicated team, community can always be developing. You could do it and contribute to the development yourself.

It's less about being legitimate and more about a huge captive audience of snake oil consumers.
