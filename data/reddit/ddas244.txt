Everyone who thinks they are safe with Bitcoin when the government collapses.
Who’s going to keep the power, cellphone towers, internet and infrastructure going?

Did you forget about bartering in gold or USD?

Pitch yourself and wake up from your dream.

Imagine if Iran really starts using Bitcoin to circumvent US sanctions and then President Trump labels Bitcoin as a national security threat and bans it.
Will that be good or bad for Bitcoin.

Drug dealers use this to launder their money.
They buy bitcoin with a bunch of cash from these machines.
It’s well documented.

There are no winners or losers in bitcoin until you sell. 
Paper gains don’t count as profit or wins until it’s realized.
Not everyone can cash out at the same price due to supply and demand.
This is basic economics 101.

Has Bitcoin brought more joy or sorrow overall?

Dude, Bitcoin was created to cut out the middle man and the banks.
All these bullshit markups, might as well stick to fiat. 
Give me a break.

Lamborghini stories are FUD.
Losing money is the reality.
It’s mathematically impossible for there to be more winners than losers.

R.I.P to all those who HODL form that time.

Care to explain?

Drug dealers use it to wash their dirty cash.
That’s why people can get away with the high rates.

Bitcoin outside of miners is a zero sum game.
If you would like to explain to the rest of us that would be great.

Bitcoin is not investing, its speculating.
Investing in a company can bring back returns as they can produce and innovate.
When you put money into Bitcoin it’s speculation of price appreciation. Nothing is created, you can only take out money if there is someone willing to pay more then what you paid.

Bitcoin is neither a financial scheme, share, or property.
Bitcoin is a crypto currency. 
That’s like saying I want to invest in the US dollar. You can’t invest in the dollar, you can only speculate its value against other currencies.

If you are a drug dealer with $100,000. You find mules, John, Lisa and George who are clean buys little at a time.
You open up a business selling pictures of David Hasselhoff for $5,000 each. John, Lisa and Geroge pay you in Bitcoin or Fiat.
You now have legitimate income.
