since he's in Italy I know what he's talking about. Not that you have to be a neighbor to understand a country's politics better but Austrians and Germans are fascinated with Italy so you hear a bit more.

yea. Italians are def the worst offenders when it comes to dirty business. Everything is ok; no path is wrong xD    
I mean it's funny if you know about it as outsider and are aware of the fact that 80% of the time you'll get fucked in the ass.     
I know a top business lawyer in Vienna who brokered a deal between Italians and Russians in Russia either in the 90's or early 2000's. I mean you can imagine how funny this must've been. I laughed my ass off when he recounted the story. Obv the italians sold a hundred thousands Euro machine which was semi-broken. :D :D love the italians lol    
The lawyer bluffed saying either you take the machine or the company will announce bankrupcy and you wont get the machine nor money.
Yea that's why I love the germanic people. They totally believe in rules and order. Love them for it.

Given the choices I understand mentioning him but why would Gary Johnson obliterate them? Trump has at least been abroad (in UAE to invest) and would know what Aleppo is, I assume. Johnson is a pothead nothig else. Or someone pls enlighten me.
