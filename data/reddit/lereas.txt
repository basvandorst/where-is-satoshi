What is it broadcasting?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:19
Yeah, that's what I keep looking at. I look at my 3 month gains and I'm still way up. It sucks being down so hard, but it isn't even nearly as bad as the drop from 1200 to 300, and we sat on that for like 2 years.

Get a wallet compatible with the fork, log in like it was your main  wallet. Make sure you've changed your primary private key first so you aren't exposing it getting the forks.

I mean, it isn't that much different from a bank account user and password, except the money isn't controlled by a bank, but instead the balance is carried in the block chain.

Not a bad idea, though it's so much of a PITA. I guess the effort is worth the protection of the value, but bleh. Really wish Electrum would just create support for BCH on the address. Way less of a headache.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:11
So you have to remember that the bitcoins are never not "online" because they're all part of the blockchain. What it means is that the private keys with which you access the coins are stored on digital media that is not connected to the internet.
At least, I think that's right.

I was joking 20k by 2018 yesterday. I would bet on it by tonight at this point, short of a giant correction.

Imagine your wallet address as being sort of an "account", or even better a particular safe in an almost infinite vault (harry potter style, maybe). The seed phrase is basically your key to your vault door.

I like to hope that if I had a huge amount of bitcoin, I'd be doing the same. Thank you for what you're doing, it's awesome. 
May I ask why exactly 5057? Or is that just what it worked out to left over when you put away what you wanted to keep?

And here is the correction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:16
I learned about it when it was $25 or less. Bought a small amount at 800. Have a good emergency fund but would have millions if I'd really gone in when I could have.
But hey. I have a healthy family and a good job, so I try not to hate myself.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:37
Right now I'm using something called Electrum. It has an android and a PC app, both of which are pretty low frills but seem to do what they need to do.

Yeah, I've been meaning to anyway.

Or it was someone who works for a bank. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:43:59
Someone explained it well above, but if you bought at 1 and it rose to 2, you doubled your worth. 
If you bought at 500 and it went to 1000, you doubled your worth.
This shows those two percentage gains to be roughly equal or at least closer. If there is the chance that the worth will double again, on this scale it shows that it has happened before and makes it easier to see.
I will agree that it makes the next doubling jump see more reasonable that it would look on linear, but the same might have been said before any of the previous jumps.
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:01:44
Do you think that guy that is always making the spray paint space pictures by the news-stand there takes bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:20:53
I'm guessing you're right, but it makes me wonder what the benefit of it is; are they just attracting business based on the idea that they accept it? In the last few days it would make sense to IMMEDIATELY convert to fiat based on the pricing trend. Or do they actually believe in the currency and want to support it and feel it will rise in value so maybe they'd hold it for later?
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:09:39
No. 
I bought at 800 because I wanted to support it as currency. I bought a few and told my wife I'm considering it as something other than a normal investment or gamble. I am not buying it so I can sell it later for fiat gain, but rather so I can use it later when more people take it and its value has appreciated. Like that post someone made with morpheus saying "No, I'm saying that when it gets that high, you won't HAVE to"
I was ready to ride it into the ground, and I'm equally ready for it to hang out around 800 forever and just be equivalent to my initial investment (though obviously I'm really losing money if I don't beat simple interest or other investments). 
I'm hoping we get above the 800, maybe way higher, and also that I can eventually use it to buy various things like I can on Overstock.
Friend of mine bought a few hundred BTC a few years back and now basically considers most things on Overstock to be "Free" when he wants something. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:28:26
Got for right around 800, still holding. 
When I got them I said that I wasn't doing it as "an investment" just trying to make money; I did it because I thought it was a cool idea and wanted to get in on it. Either I'd ride it into the ground if it failed, or end up with a lot of buying power if it eventually succeeded, but I wasn't going to just buy them and sell them later for profit -- that's what stocks are for. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:52:39
I was just thinking about them earlier. Was anything ever totally proven about them? I remember back in like 05 they had their "it was too hot for the ball bearings!" thing, and then went away for a few years before coming back with some kind of display that showed jack shit about overunity energy. Then they just faded away again. 
I never saw an article about how they were a huge fraud. They kept insisting all the way through that they were SURE what they had was real. I feel like if it was fraud, eventually I'd have seen an article about how they cut and run with all the funding. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:02:19
One other thing people need to realize is that if the price stabilizes at 300 or 500 or 800...that's all equally "good" as long as it becomes popular and highly usable.
It sucks for people who bought higher and now have lower worth, or people who had a shit ton of btc because they bought at 1 dollar and missed cashing out to fiat at 1200, but the benefits of the currency aren't diminshed becuase they have a lower "settled" worth. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:39:18
I bought 2 at the same time and feel slightly dumb about not selling at 1200 and just walking away with some profit. 
Thing is, I do believe in the system and hope that it'll go back up in time. I said when I bought it to my wife that I was going to either ride it into the ground or take it to the moon, but panicking and selling at 300 or 400 isn't really all that helpful.
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:12:29
So, serious question: where does that bitcoin go?
When I pay in cash at a store, they can use that cash to buy more merchandise, expand their stores...whatever. 
But most OEMs and construction companies don't really take bitcoin. 
Are they just holding it and expecting to exchange it for dollars later? Are they hoping that OEMs will start accepting it? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:22:19
Yeah, was looking for a similar comment. The top comment is "don't care; won't comply" basically and I really didn't expect any less.
Do you guys know anyone who reported their amazon purchases before some states started making them collect state tax? I don't.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:38:27
While I see the utility, I think this somewhat undermines the whole point of bitcoin. We want it to be a currency people use parallel to the USD (or whichever currency in your country) not just a substitute. This is just allowing you to use BTC as USD, rather than trying to help stabilize the price of BTC. 
I realize that right now it's necessary because of the volitility, but we want stores thinking "I want to sell this for 30mBTC" rather than "I want to sell this for 30 dollars, and whatever that turns out to be in BTC"
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:41:22
I think it will get there. More and more places are starting to accept it. You're right that a lot of people buy it as an investment expecting to ride it up and then exchange for national currency, but I'm hoping by the time it gets that high, it will be a usable currency in its own right.

Bought when it first hit around 600. Sat on it through 1200 and plummet down to 300. Should have bought a bunch at 300, but didn't feel quite enough confidence. Bought more at 1500, and realized if I'd spend that same at 300 I'd have 5x more.

I moved what little I had on CB into Electrum, and it was ultra-simple (short of the fact that Coinbase was going slow as fuck and took forever to send the transaction). 
Create new wallet in the app, send myself the receive address, send from Coinbase. That's it. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:38:14
Two things....
"Too late" is a huge financial fallacy. People thought it was too late when it went from pennies to 10 dollars. Then it was too late when it was 100...500..1000...If you bought at 1500 you'd have doubled your money by now. 
Second is that you can buy pretty much as small an amount as you want. Want $10 worth of bitcoin? You can buy that. Granted, you still only gain value by percentage...so if you buy $10, in order for you to get $10 more, BTC would need to go from $3000 to $6000, vs if you had a whole BTC, you get that $10 by it going from $3000 to $3010.

I found an old chat where a friend and I were staying how Bitcoin seems interesting but it was $25 each so it was a little pricey.

@_date: 2018-02-07 20:02:11
I sold some at literally the bottom after saying how I was going to hodl to the ground. I had been having a discussion with my wife about how much college was going to cost for our kids, and figured that I may well take some profits even if they were less. I still kept some in, but I'd rather walk away from this all someday being able to say I made some money if it were to all crash down.
It is shitty and I wish I'd take my own advice, but...meh. I'll miss out on a bigger slice of the moon, but it isn't like I lost money on it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:52:57
Could wait, but this dip felt worse than any from before. Waaaay more random uncles and dad's bought in this time and they were all panic seeking, and I didn't think they would be buying back in after getting out, especially if they took losses. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:04:19
Yeah. I sold like 30%at what turned out to be the bottom. Sucks. But was pure profit since I'm sitting on house money at this point. 
It's like if you walk away from the craps table with your winnings and the next 5 rolls come up 7 in come out. Yeah you could have had more, but you're walking out worth more than you came in with, so it's hard to be too upset.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:09:44
For sure. For a long time I was telling myself I didn't want to be the bitcoin pizza guy...having sold at a "measly 20k". But as much as even more would be nice, I also started to really think about and realized some people don't make that in a year....many in the world done make that in a lifetime.
I shouldn't be upset with any profits.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:21:43
True, but the adoption had been much lower. So many people who helped the prices huge rise got burned and won't buy back in later, meaning the rise to the same point will be that much harder 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:20:34
...uh...I held it like 4 years, man. Even if I wish I'd sold at 20k, the small amount I had was up plenty even at the bottom this week. 
I lost out on potential money I guess, but I made real money...it wasn't like a panic sell loss where I bought at 15k and tried to not lose it all.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:16:22
The recent uptick after the drop was due to me selling at literally the bottom, which signaled it was time to recover.
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:14:02
I bought a few at 600 before it went to 1200, and I just left them on coinbase. Can you explain why I should pull them out? 
I'm just holding them basically indefinitely until I can spend them as I would cash or credit. It will be nice if they appreciate in value in the mean time, but I'm not treating them as an investment as much as supporting the system.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:26:29
I'm so mad I didn't trust my gut and buy a bunch at 300 on the last dip.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:03:48
Fair warning; my transfer from coinbase to electrum took like 12 hours+ today, and I bet it will be worse tomorrow. I don't want to be looking for wrongdoing, but a lot of people think they're dragging their feet to sit on any BCC the accounts will hold. 
I suggest you get shit set up and send your BTC now. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:08:14
Excellent! I felt weird giving them copies of my driver's license and stuff, but knowing they are totally legit helps.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:04:45
Coinbase hasn't said that as far as I know, and they're one of the bigger ones most people use. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:16:48
Can you give a link to a guide on this? I bought on coinbase a while back and have just kind of sat on it, buying some extra now and again. I don't want to get into the nitty gritty, just step by step instructions of "install this program, look here for your address, send your coins from coinbase." along with "here is a list of ways people could fuck up and lose all of their coin, so don't do these things". 
Way back, I tried to flash custom firmware on to my old netgear router. I read the big post about it, read through the forums for like 3 hours. I posted saying "here's what I'm going to do, someone please tell me if I've fucked up anywhere" and I got a bunch of "haha, read the main post, it explains everything" so I read through one more time and did what I had planned. Turned out that the file wasn't the right one and I bricked my router. When I posted a "wtf, I asked if my stuff was right and you all didn't say anything" there was a lot of "well duh, that was the wrong file. jeez, you're dumb"
I didn't give a shit about the router...I give a lot of shits about my btc, so I want to make sure I don't do something wrong and accidentally send them off into the void. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:11:16
In a similar boat. I bought some on the advice of a friend, have bought a bit more here and there, and have enough that I don't want to lose, but at the same time I don't really want to deal with moving it around. I have only moved BTC once since buying it on coinbase, and I felt the whole time like it could just POOF into nothingness if I did just one little thing wrong. 
I'm trying to figure out how to get my coins off and feel safe about it.

@_date: 2013-11-26 19:31:26
I just bought a couple btc today. I realize I'm paying fees when I know I won't have to later, but it may also end up with the price pushed up from so much buying, and the overall price increase will be more than the fees. 
Mostly I'm just upset that I didn't have a verified account the other day when I first decided I wanted to buy some and they were at $490 or something. 
Though then I guess I could say I wish I'd mined them when they first came out or bought them at a dollar a coin or whatever. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:31:52
I realize that they don't want to specifically equate BTC to dollars so people don't think of them as an investment or a conversion factor, but it would potentially help if instead of saying "How many bitcoins do you want to buy at &lt;price/BTC&gt; they instead said "How much USD do you want to spend on BTC?" and then if you put in "$1000" for example it'll show that you get .9994834BTC or whatever it would be. 
This way people input the amount they want to spend and get whatever amount of BTC that is, rather than selecting the BTC amounts (not knowing how much they're divisible) and seeing a high USD price.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:30:00
Can take a week to get into your account.
Sadly, I believe the reason is to protect against big spikes in price since I have seen stories of people buying some and waiting for them and then having the order canceled on them and being told they were suspected of fraud where its more likely that the exchange sold them off for profit.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:38:29
Yeah, but they have no idea what 2 bits is. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:43:09
Even so, it just feels a bit unwieldly to do transactions in such "small" numbers. 
If 1btc=$1000, then if you want to buy a candy bar using bitcoin someday, it's going to be .001btc. 
I'm not saying that 1mbtc should equal $1 necessarily, but just because of how currency is typically handled in the west with dollars and euros, people have a hard time conceptually understanding how much is "a lot". With dollars and euros and such, "100" is enough to buy you say....a hotel for the night. .1BTC doesn't feel like very much even if it may be the same amount at some point. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:33:01
You can buy fractions of coins, you know.
