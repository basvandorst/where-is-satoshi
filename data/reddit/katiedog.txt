Load up Jeffrey Tucker on YouTube.   I am a single mom that was in debt and struggled but now debt-free by applying the principles bitcoin is teaching you.   I know how your mom feels.  What your mom needs to know is that you are trying to better yourself.   If she only knew the relationship improvement between you if she understood your passion for bitcoin.   Her son might just change the world and make it a better place.

You will have kids someday

Great job!  Doing your part to make a better world.

I agree and teach them the fundamentals of finance is just as important as designer purses.

Try being a single mom.  It is not easy.  I am grateful to bitcoin for turning my son around.

Mothers don't have them.  You can Google it to confirm.

He is trying to kill bitcoin jobs.

Then I issue a challenge to your mom.  If she is technically inclined have her read the original white papers.   I did.  If she is not I challenge her to listen to Jeffrey Tucker's explanation of bitcoin.   She needs to see what lit a fire under you.  Mothers need to get on board to encourage their kids even if it means they have to take the time to learn a few things themselves. 
By the way someone needs to give me cheat sheet so I can understand when my son is talking about the ethereum project.  That one will be homework for me.

It seems like an organized team of hackers have been hired by companies that are threatened by bitcoin.   Look at all the news releases from the big financial institutions trashing bitcoin.   Why wouldn't they put their resources  testing the vulnerability of bitcoin and related businesses.

Cute, I had to ask my son who that was.  When he did I got a good laugh out of it.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:58:25
Good job!

You obviously don't understand the struggles of a single mother.   I am very proud of the man my son has become.

You have my total support now get out there and invent the next innovation that will put you in the ranks of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  This Mom wants to see all you guys succeed.  With a little encouragement you will.  Now get out there and kick-butt!!!

We need to show him he did not do his homework.   Banning bitcoin is in direct opposition to his jobs legislation. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 11:25:21
Maybe your mom should have given you a little encouragement.   Kids need to know that they can change their lives with hard work and staying out of trouble.   Parents should try to take an interest in their kids.  Sorry if you don't agree. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:39:56
Well I am very proud of you.  Good job!
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:54:45
You obviously don't have children.
