No, it should not. People should start accepting cryptocurrencies without any kind of artificial centralized payment providers I fully do agree with you. We should not need Visa and Mastercard in the first place. The realities are however that to buy at Amazon or in local shops you need Fiat. At least for now. I like the idea of complete reliance on crypto; but as you see, 
our Lords like the vision, not so much.
Does this lead in a direct line to a Civil War on a global scale?

Sure thing. VISA said they've terminated WaveCrest's services due to non-compliance w/ VISA membership regulations.
Now you go research what specific terms they broke. 
Besides as WaveCrest said:
"We, WaveCrest, are the issuer of your Visa Prepaid card, which you have enrolled for through one of our program partners. Visa have today instructed us that we must close all WaveCrest issued Visa Prepaid Cards with immediate effect.”
It only shows how Visa treats their end-clients. Effective immediately etc. Such issues should have been resolved internally between Wavecrest and VISA. I doubt WaveCrest had no intention to cooperate. 
Anyway, 
one must be blind not to see how things are going in Europe for instance. In many countries, you are not allowed to make single payments with *Fiat cash* that exceed in value 4k euro;] you need to make a wire transfer for this. why? Because they want to control us. 
They want to have us with RFIDs sticking out of our....
We are not allowed to have guns like civilized free people now we are not allowed to make payments. We need to ask our Lords for an allowance and kindly let them know what we are up to.

Interesting to see how they play the  Metropolitan Commercial Bank. WaveCrest is a niche company lets see how they go about a US bank. I say MCB will terminate their cards in days to follow. I bet my 10 bucks for the end of next week.
