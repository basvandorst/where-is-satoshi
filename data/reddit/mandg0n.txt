@_date: 2017-12-22 02:03:15
bitcoin is unusable 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:55:34
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:27
I mean Segwit came out and it is still not implemented anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:07
HA YEET
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:25:22

He’s self promoting his website 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:33:54
Looking at your post history you made a post about bitcoin 2 moths ago asking if coinbase was okay. Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:26
Back down on Gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:37:28
You do you. Just wanted to express my feelings on my view of the coin. It can go both ways 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:03:13
Exactly what can you do with your bitcoin that is better than other substitutes? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:48:02
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:12:18
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:35
did you have it before the actual fork date 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:06:51
Use gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:57:43
This dip is different. Fees are insane 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:36:36
BAck down. I’m going to bed now bye bye
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:37:02
where the hell are people trading 40k
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:29:49
Yeah I remember using 3 cent fees. It made me angry using $6 fees. When I saw $25 I sold all my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:05:40
It’s up from yesterday. Not a crash 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:32:14
100k per coin? What can make bitcoin grow up to 100k? Already got mainstream attention that brought it to 19k. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:26:44
All these people have faith in something that will never come ? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:18:41
It’s worthless. No use 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:29
How exactly ? I spent $60 to move 10k and I had a Segwit wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:15
damn i have not seen this topic on here
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:22:52
shitpost 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:13:56
Lol did you buy bitcoin at 10k? I’d be salty too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:28:45
Maybe because bitcoin had a use 1 month ago?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:53:51


fee itself is like $20 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:09
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:24:18
That is pretty fast! Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:26:24
So what is the purpose of owning bitcoin? It’s not even usable 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:35:21
How are you going to convince people bitcoin is better than the fiat dollar?  $25 fees to send 1 dollar 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:28:02
$20 to send $1. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:29
I just miss the old bitcoin fees :( 3  cents was awesome 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:25
Well personally I used bitcoin around 2014 when it was cheap and just didn’t use it. Told my parents the amount I had and they supported me. Try to convince them it is something like a stock and you are going to try to profit off of it. Bring up how futures trading is a thing and how some stock companies are taking it serious.

I mean if he would at least browsed the front page he would have gotten answer. Top post is about lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:45
blockchain.info 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:56
its unfortunate i know. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:30:35
Couldn’t bitcoin be attacked? Litecoin and bitcoin cash owners have a good incentive too.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:07:48
Kek 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:09:55
Wait a few days for spam to clear up. Really nothing you can do
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:27:45
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:41:37
I don’t know. Maybe the bigger block size that is 6x bigger than bitcoins. But that is just my guess. And if 6mb is not enough we can fork the coin to 10mb and so on 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:27:25
Transfer funds to Gdax. Has not been down for me 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:30:08
What do you mean ? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:09:51
i bought bitcoin at 15k I am a long time investor and have been talking to everyone about crypoto for the last 3 weeks. e
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:06:16
Back under 14k
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:31:12
Yeah I use bitcoin for everything in my daily life. When I go to Starbucks I don’t really mind the $25 transaction feee with my coffee. When I get lunch don’t mind the $30 fee with my $10 meal (peak hours). Bitcoin is so ideal 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:32:36
How long have you been holding for ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:39:18
YEAH $25 FEES. 850sat regular fee and 1000 sat for priority fee! Def the future 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:16:03
Lots of people loosing faith in the crypto. Considering it has no real IDEAL use people are selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:25:43
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:50:53
BCH WHERE YOU AT ?????!?!
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:56:56
fuck it man I would. it can either be the best decision you make or the worst decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:03:51
