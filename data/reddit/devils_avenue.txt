ok thx. so if I transfer to a non legacy account then it will still have my Bcash?  Meaning I won't lose it or something by transferring out of the legacy account?

ok great thanks for the advice.  So just to confirm.  I'll send all my btc from my legacy account to a new normal account, THEN ill use the coin-splitting tool to get my Bcash from there?

hmm so basically, I'll transfer my btc to a new non-legacy account.  THEN when I use the coin splitting tool to claim my bcash I will point to my old legacy account (which now has no BTC in it) and get the bcash from there?

Oh man I just don't get it I guess...can you explain how it will know how many keys I had on the lost one?  I just can't get how a series of words that was set up BEFORE I even transferred 1BTC to the device can bring back all my accounts if the wallet is destroyed.  Are my accounts online and it uses those words to go search the blockchain and find what was mine?  Clearly out of my element here, thanks so much!

Hot damn I get it now!  Thx again.

do I have to do that manually, like a checkbook ledger, or can it link to my Coinable act?

If it is I sure as heck can't find it, clicked on seemingly everything.
