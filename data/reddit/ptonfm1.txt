Tulips provide pollen.  Pollen feed the insects.  Bees produce Honey.  Insects feed the birds.  Birds feed the cats.  Cats feed the coyotes.  Farm / ranch owners hunt the coyotes.  Then harvest the honey.     
 What did bitcoin do other than buy a graphics card or cpu and use electricity? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:36:27
Yeah, the ones that lost everything had trouble using anything at all because they couldn't afford it.  Idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:04:03
They aren't making money because they are holding?  Don't you even read your own boards?  
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:49:48
Why would anyone want to circuatle currency when they can hodl it like it's their precious?

Are you complaining about your job security?  Just quit right now.

There is no way that a 'bitcoin' or alternate version is worth more than a barrel of oil.  Oil.  The lifeblood of any nation.  Invest in to oil now, because much like bitcoin, it's limited so the price will only moon.

You have to plant the tree in certain conditions.  You aren't going to be planting into frozen soil.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:35:25
There is.  51 years on Oil left.  My lifetime.  It's a good thing all this solar and wind is going to farming BITCOINS...and not electrical equipment I'll need to survive when I get older.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:52:14
1,687.9 billion barrels of oil left.  Actual product.  A barrel is ~$50.  How can a fake made internet math solving software be worth more than a barrel of Oil?   Idiots.  The world is full of idiots.

Segregating something by it's color sounds colorist. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:28:11
The point isn't to short bitcoin, the point is to never put your money in it to begin with.  Idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:57:46
It's fkin HEDL if there were a single creative thought in your head.  But I hate memes with a passion so it's correctly spelled HELD. Idiots all over the internets.  Of course they'll keep the block chain going on their node, they're an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:06:53
that involves the internets.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:07:10
Rather than teach those that do not understand, you'll call them retarded.  GREAT SUB HERE.  Glad you're not a teacher teaching students.  "Why you kids so retarded, it's not that complicated." 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:59:47
Why are all these posts about a grandma or brother?
There are nothing but memes here, go look for rebutts somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:31
No because you spend money to survive.  You forgot to account for spending...
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:19:08
Right now it's used as a vehicle to increase your fiat standings.  So if anything, fiat is going up in value.  Not bitcoin.  Bitcoin is like that person you use for sex(fiat).  You're just staying with her until you find something better. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:30:59
Why would they?  Their money is more stable than BTC.

If XMAS was Year round, lights on all day...    
Compare the transactions to VISA and yeah, waste of energy.

Wow, just the website is down.  Wow.     What is Bitmex?    
Go back to posting Superman memes and "To the Moon" please.

No, the burger I bought with a dollar today can be bought with a dollar tomorrow.  Where's the hyperinflation?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:45:56
It's a metaphor you dumbass. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:08:57
Then it's not a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:19:12
nah man he's just following the community shitposting guidelines.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:41:18
Reduce reuse recycle    
Unless you're a bitcoin farmer than buy all the damn electronics you can thus raising the price for said electronics.  Let's not get started on planned obsolescence.  Mine another coin once you can't mine anymore?  Raise your transaction fees?  Buy another gpu?  You know why they call it book keeping because all they needed was a book and a pencil.  Paper is more efficient.  No need to verify that I bought a doughnut.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:59:26
The best currency is the currency that you can't use because it's "value" changes daily.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:56:51
What's worse, shitposting or your mom thinking time traveling is real? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:27:13
SO REVOLUTIONARY.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:46:11
That involves spending bitcoin as a currency.  Bitcoin isn't a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:58:26
How will fiat ever lose its worth as long as idiots keep using it to buy bitcoins to cash out for fiat.  The currency that will never be.  Why spend imaginary math equation money that magically gains worth?  
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:58:41
It's a bubble in a sense that anyone interested in bitcoin can't see past $$$$$$.  They want to stick it to the banks by....being their own bank  (reads the description of the subreddit).  You guys are brilliant.  Shouldn't you adhere to all the regulations banks go through to even be a ban?  OH RIGHT..
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:43:36
No, they won't.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:41:30
You don't think bots are real?  You've been getting your stupid computer to solve an algorithm for years but bots aren't real.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:32:09
Because it's fake currency.  Generating fake interest from fake money is the biggest scam in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:17:03
Everything depends on electricity.  Do you have a mechanical internet infrastructure?

Oh, I want to be standing in bread lines when no one can pay for the electricity to run the block chains. derp
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:01:22
How are the humans going to pay for the rides without jobs.  This nutcase. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:18:58
Shitposts make bitcoin reddit users look like shitposters that love eating shitposts.  Is it in the community guidelines that "Shitpost one must."  Kids.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:55:50
Toughen up buddy.  Advocate for not posting shit or memes and you to could be tough. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:46:20
It's not.  McDonalds feeds people while using considerable less amount of electricity.  Bitcoin feeds wallets.  What's more valuable?  
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:57:56
I think it falls under advertising.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:14:47
Why should it be so risky?  Virtual currency is supposed to be the wave of the future, but all it is doing is the same as any other stock, just, faker. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:35
Bitcoin did nothing to stabilize Puerto Rico.  They are still without power and running low on medical supplies, but that's okay because power is best used farming fake coins.

I'll turn on my Fan, now it's working to circulate the air.  It'll award me so much of a breeze by sitting in front of it.  Except now some jerk keeps turning up the heat in my room.  I buy another fan to help handle the heat and am satisfied for now.  But the guy that turned up the heat is in bed with the lady that sells me fans...    
He turns up the heat in my room again, so I buy another fan.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:23:25
It's not.  When the financial system collapses, so will the electric grid, and bye bye bitcoin.

Literally nothing is happening.  You have no relatives calling you.  Stop lying.

This is insulting to Elon as going to Mars with recycled Rockets is nothing like buying a NEW GPU to mine crypto.
