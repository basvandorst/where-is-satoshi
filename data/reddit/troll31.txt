Keep showing the Dogecar, eventually we Bitcoiners gonna get depressed :)

Sustainable adoption is impossible. I think this is the biggest problem those bitcoin creators worrying about, they just don't want people talk about it.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:39:26
What a great news, you guys made it :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:31:10
wtf, I thought Dark Wallet is really dark, nobody can see it. A chat in it?
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:58:15
People only learn a lesson when they get screwed. I wish you all the best of luck, say "to the moon" :)

Until all exchanges closed. Don't believe anything you don't like :) Haha

Hahahaha, mad is not good for your health. I've given up sugar and all the sweet food, only lost about 25b. If I want lose more weight, I'll try your way by starving myself :) Call me ugly troll please :)

If those 22 BILLION dollars in Bitcoins in a Drak Wallet, how can US government get the money out of it?
@_date: 2014-05-04 13:25:45
You are right, thank you :) I only know a little bit in English, I'll use scam next time
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:05:10
If r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org disappeared tomorrow, you'll get a better life
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:59:50
For gold, it's very simple, don't you see lots of gold in government basement? because government like it and what to keep it, and at least women can put it on their fingers :)

Here comes the communism. Are you talking about guerilla?

Why don't dream to have a date with Jennifer Lawrence? nympholepsy or paranoia, which one you prefer :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:30:20
Print Bitcoin on toilet paper? Just kidding, at least people see it everyday :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:05:11
If Bitcoin was created by governments, they will like it. Both US dollar and Bitcoin are scheme/scam, but the only different is that US dollar is backed up by US army, Bitcoin is backed up by who (college kid?)
@_date: 2014-05-04 13:15:36
There are so many other good opportunities in China, why do you guys have to stick on this cult shit. Don't waste your life on a scam :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:52:09
No, hold for sure, I'll be rich :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:26:00
We have dark wallet and black market, what you gonna do, haha
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:38:15
No, I'm going to hold my coins until we reach moon :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:39:03
US army, US law, US dollar, ... these things are fundamental of the country. The only way you replace US dollar is to remove US and rebuild a new country.
Bitcoin is just another scheme/scam. scheme/scam is not sustainable, once the number of supporter closes to its limit, the price will collapse. There's no unlimited supporters, it doesn't matter how high the price will reach, eventually it falls.

A Bitcoin backdoor, that sounds not too bad, just kidding :)
But I'm pretty sure that all you Bitcoiners personal informations and all your activities are in NSA database already, don't play game with me, told you :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:35:29
2 million merchants accepting Bitcoin is nothing, every single Bitcoins have to be dumped in market, what's the point of that. Sustainable people adoption is impossible, you will never get unlimited supporters.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:02:53
You know why people get mad, because people are nervous to the truth, Haha :) get madder
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:12:08
As long as you feel happy :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:08:03
“something we shouldn’t waste our time on.” Haha, funny  burned :) By the way, why do we need this news here?
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:04:00
Those Bitcoiners will tell you how great Bitcoin is, then you put those beautiful words in your dissertation. Once this scheme got busted, you open your paper work, and you gonna say "what a stupid joke" :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:54:47
There are some dangers for bad guys to move cash, for example a couple millions, it may get caught up over anywhere.
But if they use Bitcoin with Dark blah blah, government can do nothing.
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:22:32
China government will be extreme happy if Bitcoin weakens US dollars. I don't think US government stupid enough to allow Bitcoin to the moon :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:14:57
I don't like government neither. You create your own money in German, just like you create your own army in German, are you able to create your own army or law in German?
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:46:44
Haha, excuse me, I couldn't stop laughing :)
