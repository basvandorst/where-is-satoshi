I have not tested this on Windows. If someone wishes to submit a patch for a more Windows friendly installation/persistence layer, I would be enthusiastic about accepting it.

It runs on Bitcoin. If you don't see that, you simply haven't looked at it.

Drop Zone is designed to be a part and parcel layer over Bitcoin. This means that Drop Zone can be trivially implemented in existing wallets with nothing more than GUI tweaks. That is not the case with other solutions.

It would be my hope that it will be used as a global marketplace.

Because until today, Drop Zone only had only 1 user.

Yes. But the presumption is that buyers would not want to pay for that. I haven't tested it, but as is, I'm fairly certain that the protocol would support setting your communications to a mainnet address.

All communications between buyers and sellers are performed over testnet secured using CBC mode, 256-bit AES. The reason testnet is used is because it's a trivial implementation for existing wallets to implement and it's sufficiently anonymous for all privacy concern.

Messaging that benefits from the persistence of immutability, such as reputation and product listings, use The Blockchain. Messaging that does not need to be immutable, such as communications between buyers and sellers, use testnet. This is done because immutability is not free, but rarely needed.
Among the many discussions we are not having as a community is how we get more tips to miners. It is my expectation that as projects like Drop Zone are used, tips to miners will increase.

I will not be collecting this, but the sentiment is appreciated.

I would love to see javascript development of a frontend GUI similar to Blockchain.info.

I wrote an abstraction layer that will plug into any bitcoind. As a convenience to the initial users of Drop Zone, I chose to interface with blockr.io's library. All the method calls of the interface are directly pulled from bitcoin-cli calls. Feel free to replace this abstraction layer if you prefer.
Additionally, the takeaway from this design, for the uninitiated is that adding support to any mobile wallet is as trivial as writing a GUI.

Drop Zone uses The Blockchain's consensus to secure transactions and reputation events. It is decentralized because Bitcoin is decentralized. Everything is stored on The Blockchain except for communications between buyers and sellers which are done over testnet. I explain more here:  You are free to alter the client in any way you wish. But Drop Zone doesn't have its own consensus mechanism.

Drop Zone is a protocol. Right now, support for escrow is not included, but adding it would be trivial for anybody who wants it. Here is how I answered the question yesterday:  While I am skeptical of the need for escrow, I would be happy to accept any code that makes it possible.


The product listings are stored on The Blockchain itself. If you look through the code, you will see that adding a listing is simple. Products can be added with block expiration times, with a price, and a location and radius.


I wrote on the [metzdowd list]( "Drop Zone works as a secure message passing protocol, a marketplace, and has elements of a reputation system built in." I do not think that reputation management, itself, should be dealt with at the protocol level.

For anyone interested in the project, here is the [github repo](
I also invite you to subscribe to r/dropzone.

u/frankenmint, the software doesn't generate any addresses natively. If you have the private key, you can spend any associated funds on DropZone.
