That's really cool. I chatted with Jameson Lopp about [Lightening Network, Private Keys and Bitcoin Nodes]( which was really informative, can't wait to see this solution built out further!

How did we forget that???

Asked a question, not shilling anything.

It is a different question whether acquisition makes sense. This question is for those who have already decided that it does, what is the smartest way for them to acquire.

Can you clarify?

Completely agree, in no way are we encouraging people to stop mining at all. Have to be very grateful to those keeping the network as strong and secure as it is as well as the development of the LN! 
A lot of small miners got in when it looked super profitable at $20k and now have to run at a loss since they don't have super cheap electricity. Will be interesting to see how this shapes out in the next few months.

What makes you say that?

Definitely! Areas like China with super cheap electricity still allows for profitable mining even at current prices

For the Maximalist yes, for the average mining investor you can get more BTC per dollar just buying Bitcoin than you would for the amount you pay for electricity
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:33:00
This is very true as well. Out of curiosity, how long have you been mining for?

But that doesn't mean that won't happen and your reasoning will probably be why, don't you think?? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:28:10
I think Proof of Stake for some coins like ETH will do that but there are still downsides to that as well

I think you missed the point of the article, thanks for your input though!

Check out this one, a lot of Bitcoin related questions / discussion.

Yes, you have to stop worrying about the day to day price swings. Just adapt a long term mindset and you'll be a lot less stressed!
