So in other words you won't be remembering this advice.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:40:12
It can continue going down from here.

Since the bitcoin economy (actual commerce being conducted in bitcoin) is shrinking, the rate of inflation will continue to be high for some time even without mining subsidies. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 06:51:10
There is. Just use social security numbers.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:42:18
That's the theme song of bitcoin.

Agreed. He is going to die in prison like he deserves.

Didn't you just (somewhere else in this thread) ridicule someone by calling them a 'butter'? Your comments are rife with hypocrisy. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:40:25
No, it can't.
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:04:09
Downvoted for stating a fact.
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:07:36
That would be dishonest though since Bitcoin isn't actual money. You can convert it into real money by using an exchange.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:59:59
Naw, usually I spend my money on investments that have actual value like equity in companies and real estate.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:12:52
This may be the highest price bitcoin ever sees again, so wouldn't it make most sense to sell now? User adoption isn't increasing by any serious amount, and there are still severe problems with the protocol that haven't been addressed after 6 years that bitcoin's successor is likely to address when it gets created.
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:01:02
It's probably a good time to sell since this is now a perpetually bear market.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:18:12
We are most certainly paid, and paid well. Base salary is usually between 5 to 7k per month, plus semi annual bonuses for achieving certain goals we have set through the year on bitcoin price reduction. On top we get 401k double matching at up to 8% (we contribute 4, they contribute 8% base salary), medical, dental, prescription drug coverage, and 30 days paid time off per year. Also nice travel budget for attending bitcoin conferences too.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:44:12
Huge drop considering that btcusd has lost 5% in just the past 24 hours.
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:56:21
We get paid a lot of money to do this. Ask yourself: if you could get paid $500 a day just to post on reddit, would you turn it down? You're just jealous that you don't have jobs as easy as ours.

The problem is he has autism and Dunning Kreuger syndrome and this causes him to think he's a genius when we all see him as a babbling retard.

High risk doesn't always mean high reward. A lot of people would say you're taking a high risk **low** reward speculative bet here.
@_date: 2015-03-28 11:18:02
It's a scam. You're awfully dense if you can't see this. No one is going to rent out a money printing machine to you when they can profit more by just using it themselves.
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:12:52
US and foreign equity markets yield a CAGR real return (I.e inflation adjusted) of about 7 to 8 percent year over year if you're investing for the long haul and not just playing speculative kiddie day trading. That's pretty good return over 40 years.

They have to do this to prevent money laundering. What exactly are you complaining about?
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:46:46
Nope. I stopped using cash a long time ago. Just keep a $20 on my person in case of emergencies but I haven't had to spend any emergency cash in almost a year.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:18:15
I'm not being sarcastic though. Go look through my post history. I'm a paid shill from buttcoin and I'm paid bi-weekly from the bankroll of a major Wall Street investment bank. I truly believe that bitcoin needs more regulation so that it becomes less infested with criminals and scammers.
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:49:27
No they're not liable actually. Package was legally opened by border agents to make sure that it didn't contain illegal contents.
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:54:42
It's worth something because it has actual value, unlike Bitcoin.

Return to your basement neckbeard.
@_date: 2015-03-04 06:58:53
It's not so you can keep prices down, its so you can make a higher profit. You're not going to lower prices just because there are more cash payers, you'll just be pocketing the difference.
To answer the question: no. I will **never** use cash over a credit card because credit cards protect me in case I need to do a chargeback.
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:19:07
So what happens when price moves back down to $200. And then back down again to
$150. Will you keep averaging down? At what point do you cut your losses and realize that you've fallen into a Monte Carlo gambling strategy and that you're insolvent because you can't keep doubling down into perpetuity?
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:16:12
Because it makes everyone realize that bag hodlers are only in it to get rich quick. They'll be punished for their hubris, but we are allowed to have a laugh at their expense in the meantime.
@_date: 2015-03-13 06:56:24
Yeah actually you do need to go out of your way to defend that position. Show us an example of one country that has a functioning intranational road system that was constructed without central planning. Then show us how that system was cheaper to build than a centrally planned one.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:28:20
We actually need more regulation. Money laundering is a serious crime and we should be doing everything we can to stop it from funding terrorism and drug cartels.
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:47:52
It isn't surprising given that the majority of bitcoiners are weak academically. It's very likely that OP has gone his entire life (all 17 years of it) thinking that the idiom refers to a seed *literally* being **planned**. As in, someone *comes up with a scheme or strategy* for the seed.
@_date: 2015-02-20 05:44:15


This isn't always stupid. Like in cases where you're buying assets that are actually valuable because they're backed by something that produces value for the economy like equity in companies (that produce goods and services that people desire and therefore pay for ) or real estate (that provides housing and places for businesses to conduct business, also desirable and therefore people pay for).
When you're buying assets that are backed by nothing, or assets that are backed by something that just isn't valuable, then yes; dollar cost averaging is dumb because as Paul Tudor Jones has said, "Losers average losers."
In this case, you're right that the retards averaging down in bitcoin as an "investment" (the quotes I'm using are so sarcastic it's ridiculous) were stupid to do so because it's a valueless asset with **one** minor caveat:
Bitcoin is valuable for one thing and one thing only. It allows you to conduct illicit business slightly easier for certain things. Buying drugs, ordering assassinations, and the like. If this is what you like to do, then bitcoin has value for you. Otherwise, best to stay out of it.

Investing is not about risking as much as you're willing to lose. It's about risking as much as you're prepared to lose in order to gain as much as you're seeking to gain.
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:52:45
Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:38:56
When you have no marketable skills necessary to earn an honest living, getting rich off of Bitcoin while sitting on your ass in the basement of your dad's weekend cottage sounds like a great use of your time.
