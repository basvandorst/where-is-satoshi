This isn't really a problem as the payouts for the blocks are huge.
The only thing one should keep in mind when setting up an account with mmpool is that you cannot change your Bitcoin address afterwards. Hence you shouldn't use an address at an exchange, as the exchange may suddenly change your destination address, and then you'd loose parts of you mining income.

Not quite 6 months. Another arbitrarily chosen timeframe tells me BTC is up 7% FTD^*February-to-date*

In April we learned that Onename are going to switch from Namecoin to Blockstore because Muneeb Ali made the erroneous assumption "the code is over four years old" (watch the video at  or read the [transcript](  
A few minutes worth of browsing the Github pages would have been sufficient to find out that the latest Namecoin client is [Namecoin Core]( Developed in January, it is based on the current Bitcoin Core code and kept up-to-date since then. All merged-mining pools, be it Slush, Eligius, DiscusFish, ghash.io, Bitminter, EclipseMC and a few smaller pools are aware of Namecoin Core and are using it already. Only Onename haven't bothered to spend a few minutes worth of research at Github.  
Now all of a sudden we hear a completely different story from Ryan Shea. Something about a secret "single mining pool" dominating the Namecoin hashrate. I guess he is talking about DiscusFish (F2pool). That's right, at this very moment DiscusFish are around 63 % because Slush and possibly one other pool is under DDoS attack (the Bitcoin-related [BIP101 dispute seems to be the reason]( And right, even without the current Bitcoin DDoS issue DiscusFish have been pretty close to or over 51 % during the last few weeks. This is a temporary problem we need to solve.  
Ryan, could you now please let the cryptocurrency world know about **the real reason** you moved to Blockstore, a system with an intrinsic security problem? (more on that later)  
By the way, what is your business model? How do you want to make money in the future? Targeted advertising?
