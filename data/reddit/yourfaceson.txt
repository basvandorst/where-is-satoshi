This is it. All those people asking “when will the lightning network be implemented on the main net?” Can look here.

So I saw that Coinbase/gdax doesn’t have a tether market, but considering all that’s going down with tether, does anyone think they will fall or be effectively negatively?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:05:34
I must vent. I thought for the longest one I had strong hands, but with the market dipping I got greedy and tried to sell at a high and buy a low, so I could get more btc. That was a mistake. Lost more than I’m willing to say, and this ain’t the first time either. I’ve learned my lesson..... again.

Going to r/btc actually hurts me. It’s like, r/bitcoin and r/btc are so close, but they hate each other. Both think the other is completely brainwashed, and they talk trash about each other like there’s nothing redeemable in either subreddit.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:43:12
True. I mean, I bought back in, cuz I think we may be heading to the moon again soon, but still, my break even price just keeps getting higher
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:33:20
Yeah, and I’ve been seeing what people on r/btc are saying about it, and all they’re doing is spreading complete misinformation and lies to desperately keep people supporting bcash. I have seen a couple threads that spoke positively about LN though, so not everyone is being fooled.

Is that a hecking blade runner reference I see?
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:47:30
Anyone else read “flat” as “fiat” on their first go of the title?
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:57:23
Heyo!! This seems pretty cool! Even if I don’t win I think I’ll probably buy something from you
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:53:25
I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about the lightning network, and I’m not fully sure as to what it does. Does anyone have a link that explains it to a noob like me?
Also, I know at least I want to support it, because it’s important to the growth of bitcoin. How would I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:35:37
So I was checking out r/btc (I know, I shouldn’t meddle with them, most of what they said was false anyway and I wasn’t beguiled) and they brought up something interesting about bcash and what they called “legacy bitcoin”. They said that with segwit and the lightning network, it undermines the original view of Satoshi Nakamoto, and changes it, by not having the same security that Satoshi invisioned. Are they correct in this accusation? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:07:11
It sucks, I tried to play it by selling right beforehand and then I was gonna buy once the price went down, but then that happened. Guess I learned the hard way to not to try and predict the bitcoin market....
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:26
I’m setting up a wire transfer actually, so that’s good to hear. What’s the difference between wire and ach transfer, if there is any. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:18
I just set up a Gemini account because I’m also not happy with the way Coinbase handled bcash as well as their lack of customer relations, but the difference with Gemini and Coinbase is that Gemini doesn’t allow for debit/credit cards. My strategy is to buy the dips, and I can’t really do that if I have to wait 4-5 days. My plan is to buy on Coinbase and transfer to Gemini using gdax to cover network fees, but idk, you think that’s a good/bad idea?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:28:04
So, I was thinking of doing something where I would put like, $20 into bitcoin every Friday (the day I get my pay check), and farther down the line have it grow, but I’m totally new to this, and if anyone had any advice against that, or something to add about a more long term investment like this, I could really use some guidance. I’ve already invested only like 160 when it was a little under 10k, and the $20 I invested only this last Friday has already shown some gains, but I know that can change any time with bitcoin!!

Okay, I can’t actually believe I’m seeing all of these fudsters right now. Do you guys just sit and wait for the moment you see a red candle to post? Zoom out and notice only a couple of weeks ago we had a $1000 drop in only the course of a day, and you’re telling me this couple hundred dollar drop is the end? 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:15:54
True. I mean, yeah I’m disappointed too, but it’s the Sunday dip. There’s always tomorrow
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:58:06
God I love bitcoin

It may have been a pump, but here my brothers, is where we turn the tables and don’t let them dump. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:41:26
It’s hilarious how a green piece of paper, a shiny metal, or a shiny coin with an old guys face on it and contrived rarity makes people think they’re somehow valuable.

Does anyone know where I can apply to become a paid FUDster or altcoin shill? I could really use the extra cash to buy this dip
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:40:25
So much for the weekend dip.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:13:23
On gdax, what is considered a high volume? I used to think 20k btc was a lot, but now looking at it I see it’s about 37k atm.

My condolences to those who missed the flash sale

The year is 20xx
Bitcoin has reached a point where no online payment can stand in its way, and a single btc can buy you a house
Oh yeah and everyone mains fox

I understand the truth doesn’t always have to be happy, I’ve seen that with the market these past few month, but at the same time you’ve given no evidence or even addressed the point that your past predictions have been incorrect, and instead continue to just offer comebacks and emojis which consist of either the smiley face or the laughing face. If you have some reasoning as to why you think it will just drop as you said in your prediction, then we’re all ears to hear about it. Otherwise, if you are just trying to get a rise out of people by making false and unsupported claims, then please leave. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:37:50
All hodlers out there, young and old, lend the price chart your power
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:28:43
Yeah, I was kind of thinking the same thing. 
I agree with your opinion and thus take every FUD post and anti-FUD post with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:39:48
It has been done
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:44:33
The point he’s making is that you have gained no track record as to your ability to analyze and predict crypto currencies on this subreddit, and further, you have provided no reason for anyone to trust in your judgment and instead decide to argue that you are correct instead of provide evidence and let it speak for itself. You are the one that needs to kindly mend his/her ways.

Why are you like this?
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:27:56
Yeah, it was definitely dumb. I’ve been here since November, held and bought through the crash, and I was just frustrated expecting an unrealistic insane bull run, plus I was hungry, worked all day, and late for a meeting I had at night. I’m back in though, still holding

I can’t wait til that happens. RIP That guy that’s been posting that “article”  *10k never again*

Almost! I sold last night out of frustration, but I didn’t stay away for long at all, and came crawling back within 30 minutes
