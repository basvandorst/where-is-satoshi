Time to buy then!

9.5 Bitcoin would change my life right now lol

I’ve dabbled in Bitcoin myself. Bought about $15 worth when it was around $3500. I did seriously consider buying when it dropped to $100 a few years back. Very much regretting not buying in. My wife didn’t think I should, but she actually just told me that she was sorry this morning when it hit 16k lol

What happens when there is a backlog of transactions? Can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:38
I only have $15 in bitcoin that I bought when it was $3500, so my losses will be minimal. I just fear for everyone else.

If it drops to $12 tomorrow, I’m buying one Bitcoin and skipping my cigar allowance money for the weekend lol

I bought $10 when Bitcoin was at 3500, so I’m not in the red yet ��

Yeah, I’m not gonna get in a tizzy over what might’ve been either. More opportunities will come in the future to grow wealth and financial security, Bitcoin isn’t the final stop I’m sure.

Bitcoin has never reached 20k, and a year ago around this time, it was less than 2k. [Here’s the proof.](

Not you. OP. Sorry for the confusion.

You should probably mark this post NSFW btw.

this post was not a very smart thing to put here.

Why give any credence to a fiat currency backed by a govt that will just print more, even when said currency fails, in an attempt to keep up the status quo and quell public doubts about the value of their dollar? It’s a house of cards built on top of a house of paper dollar bills.

Hope I’m not late and thank you for doing this.

Kind of like people taking on debt to buy crypto, dumped crypto when the going got tough, and didn’t have enough money left over to pay the debt?

I apologize. I had been scrolling my feed for a while and came across your post without refreshing and it appeared it had been posted just a few minutes ago.

$3500? It’s at $3,336 right now.
