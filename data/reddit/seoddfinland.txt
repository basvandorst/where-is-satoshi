Please check on how money is created   
Every single currency unit in their debit card has been debt. 
This is why I wrote that they will be unaware of these facts. Money is the root cause to many of our problems which lure in the background.
@_date: 2019-07-13 11:08:02
It will remove the need for money being created as debt... Do you know that most (almost all) of the fiat money you ever encounter is debt? This means that it also carries interest and has to be paid back to the banks. 
Banks can still function as lenders... no problem, but bitcoin being money will force them to actually carry some risk when lending out that money. Fractional reserve banking system that enables banks to create money will then come to an end. 
Banks will no longer have the ability to create money as debt and they will not be forced to conduct moral hazard in order to compete with other banks by taking unnecessary risks upon creating that money. 
There exists also no reason why Bitcoins could not have a third party custodial and insurance solution for those who require, or need it.
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:50:16
Yes probably if you made a profit in the way.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:12:44
So how much were the fees of your payment in total?
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:22:05
So what is bitcoin to you?
@_date: 2019-08-24 03:12:32
Thank you for the answer. But that is kind of my point.
The term bitcoin has then lost its original meaning. 
It does not mean the same thing as it used to mean. I will be a scammer to my friends, family and basically to the entire humankind, if I do not try to explain that the term bitcoin, as used for BTC is no longer the bitcoin I have been telling them about. 
If I don't explain that BTC is no longer the bitcoin I have been talking about all these years, they will be fooled into believing that BTC is that bitcoin and maybe even buying it in the hope of buying a cryptocurrency that is peer-to-peer cash with instant reliable transactions with low fees, which is able to disrupt the current financial system.  
Do you understand my problem?
So therefore I feel the actual scam is in BTC using the term bitcoin, as it is not the bitcoin it was supposed to be. It kind of stole the term and brand value at the same time. 
The idea of bitcoin is too valuable to let it become just another investment tool to make some fiat and keep the current financial system destroying the world. I hope we can agree on that.
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:16:16
Well no, because both of them are Bitcoin with different scaling solutions. Other one chose to scale and the other one chose not to scale.  
They just have different tickers e.g. BCH scaled and has reliable instant transactions with low near zero fees, BTC didn't scale and has slow transactions with high fees and unreliable transactions if you use low fees. 
BCH chose the option that enjoyed the majority support to scale on chain with bigger blocks.
BTC chose the minority support option with Segwit (only accepted ultimately because bigger blocks were promised, if the miners signaled approval for Segwit) and future second layer solutions. Of course later it came out that Segwit wasn't actually a scaling solution, but it was marketed as such in the beginning.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:06:39
Well not really. I think you don't understand how forking works. 
Hint: They share the same block chain until August 2017.
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:41:19
And the fee with the on-chain transfer?
@_date: 2019-08-23 17:43:38
Where can I look that EDA from?... And how does that relate to Jihan Wu giving himself the mentioned BCH? 
Please be precise. You are making some quite serious allegations, so please be ready to confirm them.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:53:43
I thought we should just hodl, so we don't end up like the pizzaguy.
At least he was a part of making bitcoin to be what it is today.
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:21:31
That sucks man.
I guess you could buy BCH through local.bitcoin.com and then exchange it to BTC with an exchange that doesn't require KYC on crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-18 13:27:40
Correct and so does not your partner... The bank owns her fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:58:42
And how did you move your BTC to that channel?
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:39:48
And how fast did your BTC reach your channel?
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:59:49
So we agree on what I wrote right? I make this conclusion as you are not addressing any of the points mentioned. 
But I see you want to discuss another matter on BCH, which is OK. 


The **average** block time is ten minutes. There is a difference. Sometimes blocks are found faster and sometimes it takes longer, but the difficulty adjusts so that the average stays at ten minutes. 


Completely against the hash chain consensus of nodes being able to leave and rejoin the network without trusting anything but the longest proof of work.
Can you provide a source on this?
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:05:46
Yes it is. 
Look at a fork and you see that it divides into many spikes at the end. 
Bitcoin Core is one of those spikes and BCH is another.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:49:46


So bitcoin should not be money in itself? A medium of exchange that does not require banks to validate your transactions and give you permission of transacting with it?
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:46:25
BCH works like Bitcoin was intended to work. 


Don't you think there was a hint of scam when the block size increase didn't happen as promised for BTC? And how about it still not happening after the disaster with the fees and transaction times at the end of 2017? 
Don't you think it was harmful that all those newcomers had that as their first experience of cryptocurrencies? I don't blame so many people not trusting crypto after that. The blame is on the people who decided to destroy the user experience. 
Try using BCH as currency and then try using BTC as currency.
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:09:47
They do and what is delightful, some even use it as bitcoin was intended to be used. 
I used to use BTC for payments, but had to give it up as it came too expensive and unreliable when using low fees, as no idea when the transaction would clear.
How do you use BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-23 17:33:38
Where did I say that? 
Please read again and we can discuss further.
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:06:15


This is just stupidity, or false narrative in purpose. Bitcoin functioning as a direct payment tool, is its most important function. This is what has made bitcoin valuable in the first place and it will remain valuable only if it can be used as money. 
If you use it just for savings you rip the invention of the most interesting part of its characteristics. 
Just consider how bitcoin can enable direct international payments without any need to pay a bank in between, or to exchange currency.
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:56:41
If somebody would ask me to explain bitcoin, I would explain it as I have always explained it, as an alternative peer-to-peer decentralized currency that can replace banks as guardians and creators of money and create a more equal and just financial system that is not based on debt... 
and BCH is more closer to that than BTC, which has diminished to being just an investment tool that actually supports the current financial order. 
So I would basically be lying to the people, if I would claim BTC to be that Bitcoin, which I have tried to explain them before. Long before BCH even existed. 
It would be shameful and deceitful for me to do that. 


Bigger blocks always had the majority support as a scaling solution. Please check.
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:33:18


But if you understand my point, you understand that I can't honestly call BTC bitcoin anymore. It would be a shameful and deceitful act on my behalf.
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:24:55
You have a point there, but privacy is quite an important feature of crypto in general. 
It is an important feature of money in general. 
Would you like me to know your transaction history and account balance?
If not, then why give this information to the exchanges/banks?
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:50:12
And this is counting the transaction of moving your BTC to Moon?
How quickly were you able to actually transact?
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:46:54


Are you referring to BTC adapting SegWit? 
Which was certainly their own stuff and I think most would at this point agree... A mistake.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:03:37
Look again what was written. 
Bigger blocks-scaling solution for bitcoin has always had majority support. This does not particularly mean BCH. 
But I think you already are aware of that fact.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:59:46
Ok, then... 
How did you do it with zero fees?
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:35:47
Please provide a source for your claims. They are all not true and I am getting the feeling that you are deliberately making false claims. 
It is true that in the beginning BCH did not work as smoothly as it does now, but the problem was mostly that the blocks were found in longer intervals. 


Why would you say something like that without backing up your claim? So how is it centrally controlled? 


This is simply not true. The average block time is 10 minutes. 
And by the way... I don't think Satoshi ever meant that it will be like that until the end of mining :D 


Luckily BCH has scaled and it can handle any spam attacks.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:35:04
Have you tried BCH? 
And if not... Why not?
It is the same old Bitcoin which we all used to love, without segwit and high fees.
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:47:09
Why did he move to master lightning instead of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:29:32
Thank you for the reply. 
Still I would like clarification on the point you make about government, or central bank (fed) owning the money, instead of the bank that only possesses them?... Might be I am misunderstanding something in your comment.  
In this example we were talking about a normal bank account in a commercial bank. As so far there is no possibility for a private person to have an account in a central bank (which is most likely to change very soon with the state-issued digital currencies).
I understand the point you made about the term difference, of possessing the money instead of owning it (while I don't think it makes a lot of difference in practice, as they can do with most of that money what they want), if they in principle owe it to you. 
If a government borrows its money supply from private banks (on which it also pays interest on), I can't see the government owning that money at any point, which gets deposited back into private bank accounts through government spending. 
It is more like the opposite, the private banks own the government (which in democracy normally should mean just a general categorization of the people).
@_date: 2019-08-23 17:53:37


Then I don't understand the meaning of the thread. 
Don't they want to learn?


This is just ridiculous semantics and you know it. Anyhow all I get from this post is that you saying that both are **soccer**. I agree, so we can agree on that. 
The scam is bitcoin/btc becoming just a simple investment tool to make a bit more fiat. Anybody who is interested in anything other than making (fiat) money, should be looking for alternatives that have possibilities to disrupt the financial system and therefore make the world a better place.
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:18:12
Ok but which coin actually changed the shakespeares design?
The one that added SegWit and changed the rules of writing style on the following pages, or the one that used larger pages to add more writing space in the same style?
Please get out of this namecalling of shitcoin, or whatever... It just makes you look really bad and I am not that easily triggered.
@_date: 2019-08-19 03:12:29


Fed is not part of the government. It is a private entity separate of government. 


Can you elaborate the meaning of this a bit? Governments normally borrow their money supply from private banks.
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:35:51
Agree with almost everything you wrote there. 
Hopefully we'll get there soon... Without banks hijacking bitcoin on the way :)
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:56:56
Supercool answer. 
Now I understand them perfect. 


How does this help me to understand anything? I think with statements like these you also alienate the people you don't want to. 


Does BCH share the blockchain and history with BTC up until August 2017?
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:11:29
How can fractional reserve lending happen with a currency that has limited supply that the lenders are unable to expand?
I could see it happening in a certain kind of second layer solution built on top of that currency, that works mostly on transferring IOU:s and the main network tokens working as fractional reserves for those IOU:s.
With gold you mean current "paper" trading of imaginary gold? Or printing out more gold backed "currency" than was actually kept as reserves?
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:34:22


This statement seems incorrect. The purchasing power of BTC normally goes up the more longer you hold it. Check the history. 
It should work as a currency that encourages saving, unlike the USD that will certainly lose purchasing power the more longer you hold it and you should spend it as quickly as possible. 
Of course currently BTC is not functioning as a currency anymore and has become a speculation tool.
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:29:43
So nobody doesn't want to answer the actual question? 
Frustrating stuff.
@_date: 2019-06-08 18:34:23
Wrong... And yes.... Just check how hard it is to start your own bank. You will need political connections at least
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:51:54
Why is that?
Unlike traditional currencies it holds its value, due to limited supply and a poor person who gets paid in Bitcoin, can buy the same piece of bread still after a few months which he can buy today... Probably even 1,2 or even 2 pieces of bread. 
With fiat he could in a few months buy only 0.95 pieces of bread, depending on the inflation rate.
Also, as it is not created as debt he did not indirectly have to borrow the money from the lending class (bank stock owners) and pay it back with interest. It is an automatic system that transfers/keeps any real wealth in the hands of the lenders. 
Bitcoin causes the power that the banks have on the poor to diminish.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:13:51
The utility value of any currency will be of using it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:06:39
He's clearly the excluded poor guy who can't afford the current fees.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:41:59
What?? 
Are you right in the head? Please stop this madness now. 
You are like the banks man. Now we have a chance to change the system and you want to go back to that shit?
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:02:52
Is it scaling so that the fees remain reasonable? Your comment brings no additional value to peer-to-peer cash. We need it urgently.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:41:00
Do you remember why segwit got consensus?
If not... I will remind you because of the promise of 2MB blocks.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:33:43
Actually it seems it is, as you are lying so much it hurts. All the things you are saying, just confirms what I have been saying from the start. Please grow some conscience. 
Only reason SegWit reached consensus was the 2X part and I now know you also know it. So just admit it and stop this nonsense.
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:51:41


Ridiculous joke mate. Hahaahahaa. Good luck on your chosen path with a coin that needs layers to work.
I hope your path eventually leads you to bitcoin and actual control-free money soon.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:23:33
ad hominem doesn't work so well actually... only if you are using it on Trump.
Good luck by the way on your chosen path, which seems to lead to a human kind gone extinct... No Joke. But you, and your kind, will be held responsible eventually.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:50:05
This is true. 
Now it is sad how bitcoin has been transformed into something most people in the early days would have not wanted to see it transform into. Anyhow luckily bitcoin still lives.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:41:46
So you also agree that the promise of block size increase was a scam to get SegWit activated?
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:55:19


Who is it then?
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:08:06
The majority was always voting for increasing it. What are you talking about?
Trying to confuse on purpose, or just ignorant?
Proof is in the fact that it wasn't increased. Sorry, but a cold fact.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:21:04
I think SegWit was not called off, but please do tell me who refuted the very urgently needed block size increase?
Fairly interesting read also: 
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:01:00
Why was it called SegWit **2**X? Please check the history before you answer and make a fool of yourself. 
Manipulative nature :D
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:12:59
Please clarify and be sure to make them stand? With links and whatever. You are either new here or trying to make false claims.
What are your intentions? Why do you want to lie to the people? Absolute waste.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:50:59
Absolutely wrong. Do not make false statements like this again.
Increasing the block size was the only reason that the majority of miners voted for SegWit. Please check the history.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:10:59
Please do clarify?
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:54:13
Not yet of course... But that is what we are targeting right?
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:42:32
Being poor does not equal being stupid.
This remark makes me lose all interest in this conversation. If you are that ignorant, you can't possibly comprehend the true value of a peer-to-peer currency. 
I could wait, but some people can't afford to wait, which was my point from the beginning. Instead I have to look for alternatives that will be more efficient in realizing it, even if I wouldn't want to.
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:34:52
Please offer details and correct me in a reliable way. 
I truly would appreciate that. So far have not yet received any reliable counter-arguments on that.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:45:53
Got your point and agree, but I think it is achievable right now... Just sad it adoption has been intentionally delayed in some ways. I hope you read that from my original post.
We could already be doing the things you mentioned with an easier solution.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:29:04
OK... then tell me why is it excluding the people it was supposed to help right now? 
The people in desperate need right now and they can't afford high fees. Also they can not afford to not adopt early.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:15:16
That is like closing your eyes when the thunder approaches. 
Might make you feel safer for a moment...
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:30:46
You don't believe people using it?
Even though they invest in it, I hope they have higher intentions in mind e.g. savings instead of buying stocks in the traditional finance/gambling market.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:55:35
OK, but in this case the middle-man is normally a group that you can be a part of, not an outside entity.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:49:01
How to make it possible for everybody then to do this? 
Is crypto in general with its POW pointless, because the LN with its custodian priviliges seems to be just that?
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:41:10
Yes but Bitcoin will become much more powerful when we start discussing about value of things in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:15:07
This I agree upon. That is why we can not let it be controlled by anybody.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:03:53
I am nobody to say anything just as you...
but when you research the current monetary system and the problems of the world, I am sure you will find a connection. The monetary system is a root cause that needs to be corrected and the idea of Bitcoin can do that. 
Instead of surrendering to fatalism, please have a look at how we can make this happen together.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:34:13
But time is of the essence I believe. 
Anyhow thanks for your thoughts and I will do the same.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:47:43
Thanks and please point out where I am wrong. 
I really would like to know.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:13:41
Which is more convenient?
Opening a payment channel or downloading a custodial wallet? 
I know I would never have the patience of opening channels...
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:14:26
OK, true in a way, but how does that transform into benefiting the world?
Do you think about these things and of their importance when transacting with money?
@_date: 2019-05-28 06:27:58
I was planning to read it but if you exclude the reason of money being created as debt, I chose to just scroll.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:31:53
But the real utility of it is in using it and it is crucial for a massive percentage of people.
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:14:20
Yes I was and agree, but LN seems like a poor mans choice to scale it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:38:34
How does this benefit the conversation of BTC:s utility value?
"OP was an astroturfing r/btc numpty all along, as several others pointed out."
Actually very interested to be educated.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:19:59
This is a poor reply. Price is only relevant if you are hung up on the idea of USD as the only money out there. 
Bitcoin should become money! It is not a means to make more money.
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:39:21
No. This adds an intermediate, which bitcoin was meant to get rid of.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:45:06
Because the network is enough. LN just confuses newcomers and make them believe in its necessity. People need to understand the importance of being in control of their own tokens/money/value/ and not render it to a service provider. 
I don't understand the need for the second layer. 
Why do we really need LN, when we already have Bitcoin and its network hashing that makes it reliable?
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:52:04
You spending it 2014-2016 made it possible to be of value today. 
Without the characteristics of being money, bitcoin would not be worth anything close to what it is today.
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:38:07
No. Wrong. You think of USD as a constant in that. Purchasing value of bitcoin is relevant, not its value against the USD.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:00:23
This I don't understand. Why would you choose to pay larger fees even if your f... choise? 
Also the network becomes exclusive in that mindset. 
Only the wealthy can participate.
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:16:10
Is it still bitcoin? Seems totally foreign for the idea.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:11:03
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:26:33
No hidden agenda. I want you to change my mind.
The reason for my post. But I have a hard time understanding the LN:s usefulness plus the need to keep fees high on-chain. This way the new financial system will exclude the poor just as the old one did. 
Surely you must understand my point as well?
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:50:20
Because of transaction fees that exclude most of the population in the world. 
Otherwise interesting points you make. I got into bitcoin because of a more just monetary system and that why I am passionate about its purpose. 
Why is it impossible to scale on-chain without maintaining decentralization?
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:57:01
What? 
I meant the question as explaining of what my understanding is flawed. 
Naturally from those poor alternatives USD...
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:30:15
I am an economist by education and I really hope all this would be true (referring to control of interest)... but having experienced the late 2017 transaction fees and confirmation times, I know it is just the original fantasy. The utility of BTC has been intentionally destroyed. 
All the things you point out though are valid but BTC will not fulfill them no longer. BTC seems to be controlled by the traditional financial powers at be. Otherwise it would have scaled long times ago to enablethe function of interact as peer-to-peer money.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:51:41
Astroturfing... hmmm. Maybe for the original idea which seems to be lost to so many, but I have no coin in mind. I fell in love with the idea of BTC and how it was going to free the world, but it has become unrecognizable to what it was. 
LN, for example, is just the re-introduction of the middle-man which I wanted to get rid of by entering this new exciting financial system.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:22:43
Appreciate your honesty. 
What do you think brings intrinsic value to this new investment asset class?
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:28:18
Perhaps. True concern?
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:15:07
But it is kind of is an emergency isn't it? We need an alternative monetary system to get rid of the "money created as debt" paradigm... And we need it fast.
It can release us of the curse of the need for constant economic growth (No need to pay back the interest on the debt), for example. 
This can get better by involving everyone (low fees) and disabling a system that benefits only the ones in control of it, by replacing it with a system that nobody is in control of. 
I don't really care about big block or small blocks, but I do care about bitcoin being free of manipulation and capable of being the monetary system that will bring economical freedom to all... Instead of the economical slavery that the traditional system is now offering to the poor of the world.
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:08:44
I have performed a lightning transaction on my cell phone and it required me to do a on-chain transaction to move my BTC with the required fee. 
Also I was trying to locate a back-up of my wallet so I could be in control of it, but I could not find it. Please tell me if I am (f)actually wrong and I can be in full control of my coins within a ligthning-transaction enabling mobile wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:09:43
Ok then how about 1000 satoshis? 
Have you ever used any other currency than the USD? 
If so, at those moments I am sure you have made the mental conversion in your mind while paying. 
Nothing different with Crypto... That is why I am expecting Bitcoin to take the place of USD in our minds and monetary transacting.
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:32:20
Still sad, don't you think?
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:29:35
Do you have a link to that? Tried googling, but can not find.
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:02:40
Because if it is money, it will benefit ALL instead of just benefiting me as an investment.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:35:55
@_date: 2019-05-26 01:56:33
Bitcoin should be money. Not an investment to make money.
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:06:10
Thanks. I agree.
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:04:50
OK, most of what you write here makes sense. 
There is a very important aspect of money being, and created as, debt unmentioned. This is true for most of the discussion involving crypto and money. For some reason this gets ignored.
