Agreed, and same experience - STILL WAITING.
Also note, they just changed their fees - email transfer are now NOT FREE, they are $2.50 and limited to $500 transfer.
BAIT AND SWITCH marketing - beware.

does he also think governments will outlaw trading in gold...?

Imagine you saved them. Then one day on the way to get your big cash you got in a car accident and died.  
Not keeping them actually *saved your life*.
There are infinite scenarios when proposing "If only I..."

It was only today they just introduced that fee. Meanwhile they have been saying "Free" since launch.
They launched under "free" and then immediately introduce fees when people start using the service?  
Your choice, but it's a telltale sign to me of unscrupulous marketing.

- would recommend enroll in free course "cryptography 1" by stanford university - coursera.org.

Beware - they are sneaking in new fees.
They announced/advertised free email money transfers, but oh hey, suddenly now it's $2.50 charge, since people actually started using it.
That is a bad sign - not the amount of $2.50, but the bait and switch.
Be warned - they have shown the signs of being dishonourable.  Do you want to trust your money with a business who does the bait and switch?
cavirtex - expensive, but they are upfront and honest about their service.
