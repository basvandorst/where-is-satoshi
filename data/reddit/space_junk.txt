You mean like this? Looks like they already take bits.
" The point is, we realize there are times when you may find yourself in possession of a RiffTrax that you didn’t pay for (hey, it’s the internet – it happens.) All we ask is that you do the right thing so that we can keep bringing you quality riffing for years to come."

Because no matter what the economic, monetary, or social problem, bitcoin is the answer.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:23:43
Are you a customer? If not I don't think it would be a good idea. Think about it. If they get 2,000 people emailing them to accept bitcoins, yet they will only get 4 or 5 people actually paying in bitcoin how's that going to look to them?
Someone did that to a local business where I live. The company put up a poll asking if we accepted bitcoins would you pay using them. The poll ended up being like thousands of people saying yes and 10 or so saying no, because someone posted it to reddit. This was for a food delivery company in Melbourne Australia. The company is in for a shock if they decide to accept bitcoin because probably 99% of the people responding don't even live in Australia.

Why stop there? Maybe you could get a bank loan for, say 100K? Buy bitcoin with it. Then you could let the price rise to 10,000 per coin and buy your own island.
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:40:54
Exactly. I thought bitcoin stood for freedom. I hope some of these bitcoin Barrons help you in your journey. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:28:16
What do you consider rich?
 My good news: I doubled my initial investment into bitcoin. The bad news: I had 3 coins. Still, I bought a copy of GTA 5, and took some friends out for a few nice dinners with the proceeds, so it was a win for me.
@_date: 2014-11-15 10:56:38
Yup. It looked like a spammy bot randomly visited the thread. I'd be surprised if it didn't piss more people off there than it got interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:19:49
But that reviewer is still free to publish the review elsewhere. Or start a whole new Web page etc for his review. Low pay =/= to no freedom.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:35:04
I have seen hundreds of accusations here about people being paid shills. No one has ever given any evidence that it actually happens. Who is paying them, and why?

So you would not get her an Xmas present just because you want to use bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:31:29
Make sure to tell the guys over at your plan before you put it into action. I'm sure they would be more than happy to frontrun it for you!
@_date: 2014-11-09 06:09:20








I'll add another few
3) When Palestine and Israel are best friends.
4) When North Korea becomes the 51st state in the USA
5) When Warren Buffet apologizes for dissing bitcoin and suggests everyone convert their fiat.
6) When Scientology is declared world religion.
7) Barney Frank becomes the president of the NRA.
Hope that helps.

Plus if you account for inflation, 250 mil 1995 dollars is approximately 400 mil 2014 dollars, making the entire premise untrue.
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:52:08
You still didn't answer his original question. In what way is it not free.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:01:50
This is really sad. I don't have any advice to give, but I do hope you are able to get some help and turn things around.
@_date: 2014-10-29 23:27:33
I subscribe to both and Yes is one of the more outspoken members of buttcoin but he often makes very valid points in this sub, which can be quite an echo chamber. How far does it go after banning him? Will you ban anyone who isn't towing the party line? Who gets to decide? 
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:52:45
Yea, I see no evidence that the 1995 dollars are inflation adjusted. Why not add bitcoin vc is almost double what was spent on the Hoover Dam, built in 1936 costing $165 million?
@_date: 2014-11-04 08:42:44
I did, a long time ago. I bought 3 of them in October of last year. I thought/think it's an interesting technology. I played around with them for a while and discovered it was too much of a hassle to spend them, plus during the 3 or 4 weeks I owned them they doubled in value. So I ended up selling them for double what I paid about a month later.
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:27:35
I agree, this is imminent. Why can't we create a bitcoin funded kickstarter to send a lot of bitcoin/blockchain missionaries to North Korea? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:12:37
If you are so worried and believe bitcoin needs a "defibrillator" and that a scheme to engineer a mass purchase is the way to save it, perhaps it's time to put your money elsewhere for investment purposes? This plan smacks of pump and dump.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:46:04
The way price has been trending they can sell low now, or sell even lower in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-02 07:55:12
So are you saying there is an early adoptor buttcoin whale out there, just biding his time, waiting to crash our Gox?
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:43:46
I'g guess most are looking at this from a the government is trying to take my assets view. But think for a minute about it from another perspective. 
A few years ago I was rear ended while at a stoplight by an uninsured motorist going about 55 MPH. It totaled my truck and I had about $3k of medical bills. The guy wasn't broke despite not having insurance. My lawyer took him to court and won a judgement in my favor for medical bills + cost to replace the truck. Not a lot of money really. But the guy knew that either he gives it up voluntarily or the court would take it from him involuntarily.
Now consider how this would go down in bitcoin land. What is to keep this guy from just saying oh I forgot/misplaced my private key? As much as I don't like the thought of it, there are still valid reasons that courts and governments need to have access to peoples money.
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:24:46
A life without bitcoins truly is a living hell. I mean, how are you even going to buy alpaca socks?
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:51:41
Do you know if any of the BTC ATMs will be supporting this new coin?
Also, do you expect them to raise in value?

But who else will fight against an evil company that %99 of reddit has never used, nor will ever need to? I hear that in response to his "ad" WU board of directors has been called into emergency meetings and will unleash a wave of paid shills upon reddit. Plus the CEO was so scared of the bitcoin vs WU ad he literally turned into a pillar of salt.
@_date: 2014-11-22 10:43:14
Yes. The only result of this can be WU total collapse and bankruptcy within the week.

I'm sure that while the elderly hardware store owner in Milwaukee is spending 15 minutes scraping that sticker off his front door he's going to be wondering how *he* can get in on this whole bitcoin thing.

Um...a bunch of guys getting drunk on a boat?
@_date: 2014-10-20 07:14:25
Agreed. The next 30-60 days are critical.
@_date: 2014-10-20 06:52:09
And what if in two months it's significantly lower still? 
The ark of the covenant doesn't have a tablet with "bitcoin must always go up" inscribed on it. There is a chance many people will ride this to the bottom. For an example of why this is a terrible idea look at the employees of Enon who bought stock all the way down to zero.

But the doco wouldn't be about fishing. Imagine instead it is about the fishermen walking around town buying ice, beer, lures, minnows,  fishing line, and finding a hotel for the night. Sounds infinitly more dull.

I had an Alienware laptop many years ago, before Dell bought them. Luckily I was able to convince my non IT boss that I needed one because it cost about 4K.  It was gigantic, heavier than a box of hammers, it threw off enough heat to boil a can of coke set next to the air vent, and when the two fans on the bottom kicked in it sounded like a C-130 taking off. It was okay for gaming I guess.

Dare we say euphoric when the price hits $100/coin? 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:43:28
So maybe bitcoin is the Banyan Vines cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:17:48
Not to pick on you or anything, but I also notice the source for bitcoin VC is CoinDesk. They are hardly a neutral party, I wonder how they came up with that number.

The hassle and complexity of securing your bitcoins &gt; any discount a merchant can realistically offer right now.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:39:45
No "most" people are not interested in it. Most people have never heard of it.

Exactly. This is why it's a terrible idea.
@_date: 2014-12-01 09:40:07
So then bitcoin will cover all the people who suffered "unauthorized transactions" with their blockchain.info wallet recently?
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:37:44
Look, unless they are into it you may as well give them some Japanese Yen. I guess the only difference is you can take the Yen to the bank and easily exchange it for the currency of your choice.

Okay putting aside price, it sounds like the OP is addicted to gambling. While I'm no addiction expert I do believe that abstinence is the central tenant of most addiction treatment.

I was just making a point that comparing 1995 dollars to 2014 dollars without adjusting for inflation is ridiculous.

Can I ask what led you to this conclusion? Why is this something you figured out, and not the teams of archeologists who have devoted their entire lives to studying Stonehenge?
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:08:21
It just sounds to me like you don't want any dissenting opinions. All good bitcoin news, all the time.
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:39:44
This is true. If we ignore the fact that humans have been fighting and waring for thousands of years before the concept of fiat currency. Bitcoin will not change human nature.

@_date: 2014-10-22 03:45:35
Does it really matter? With the imminent collapse of major world economies making fiat worthless, and bitcoin taking its place as the de facto currency of the world, we are in trouble my friend. The only route to salvation for us is to pray to the almighty block chain for some sort of crypto-dole. I fear we are on the wrong team.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:11:12


I don't understand this. Why will bitcoin create a new middle class? If someone's Labour is valued such that it means they are in poverty is that going to change just because bitcoin?

I'd generally agree with you. Once the name calling starts, rational discussion usually ends.
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:48:43
Interesting. What can be done to mitigate this? I see people here hoping for mass adoption, but if people have to wait hours to see their transactions go through, like the OP, I don't see how bitcoin could ever work.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:56:08
This makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to explain it. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:21:08
Why does this have to be manipulation? Would you call it manipulation if the price was rising? Short selling is a part of normal market operations, not necessarily manipulation.  Look at it this way, with a huge open short interest there is a limit to how far it can fall since eventually those shorts have to be bought back.
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:33:30
How do you derive the proper value of bitcoin to be around $300. Just curious.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:59:43
I'm not sure about bitcoin trading platforms and brokers but, if it's anything like forex the traders probably have a stop loss order in place to buy if the price rises too much and they begin to lose money. 
They may also have limit orders in place to to take profit if it moves in their favour.  
And then should bitcoin move drastically against them the broker should be able to close all of their positions if their available margin =&lt; 0. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:28:52
I'm familiar with double spending and know its tough to accomplish. I was more interested in the situation where the blocks take a long time to mine, are people wanting to spend bitcoin with a merchant that accepts it directly stuck waiting till the block is mined.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:03:58
How would that help the case of a transaction being stuck until a block is mined?
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:55:31
Not being a bitcoin user I chose a bad example. Say I'm at JB HiFi tring to buy a new MacBook, using bitcoins. It seems in this case that I'll just have to wait till the block is mined (in this case 2 hours), or JB HiFi will just have to trust me after the transaction is broadcast to the network. 
I doubt they will let me leave with a $2000 computer and 0 confirmations. 
Is someone trying to fix this? I cannot see mass adoption taking place when this can happen at any time.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:18:59
Got it. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:41:49
I asked this question on another thread about this issue but I'll ask here too:
So what I'm wondering..when these "hard blocks" happen does the whole bitcoin economy grind to a halt? What if I'm waiting to pay for a coffee, do I have to just sit it out for 1 hour and 55 minutes till it's done?
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:15:40
Great thread. It's a thing that happened, why are you getting down voted for it?
I liked the guy in it who said he was waiting to buy till $250 looked cheap and they laughed at him.
Bitcoins like the early Internet. All hail bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:43:44
Looks like you are saying that if they accept the bitcoins directly you're going to be stuck there for 2 hours, or the merchant will have to trust you and let you leave.
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:03:19


Could you share reasons for that conclusion? Who is manipulating, why, and how?
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:19:46
I'm not sure, but I'd imagine that you wouldn't be able to find a bitcoin broker willing to let you naked short. How would they ever collect if your bet went really bad?
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:07:31

Yea I see no point in being rude calling people stupid. Things like that. Plus my guess is that most bitcoiners are are probably good smart people. I just like to poke fun at the ones who think bitcoin will magically end poverty....just cause bitcoin. Or think bitcoin is the most important invention in the history of human civilization,  etc..
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:12:18


People have been saying this since coins were $500. Funny how the cheap coins keep getting cheaper.
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:17:27
That's not manipulation,  that's just a healthy market at work. If the underlying instrument is strong this won't work.  If it's weak the shorts will pay out.

I agree with all of this. I'd also add that it will be hard for retailers to price items in bitcoins if we keep up with all of this volatility, won't it? Especially more expensive items.
