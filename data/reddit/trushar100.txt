So initially right after a fork we have doubled our money?

So for now, we sit and wait. Nothing more?

Well this definitely cleared things up :-/

Thank you. 
So would you not store banking info in LastPass either? Say you have several high value fiat accounts with cash and other securities... would you have paper wallets for those accounts too?
It seems to me that would mean someone with say, a few cash accounts, stocks, digital asset, crypto accounts, etc would have a notebook full of login info. 
Another question: is crypto more susceptible to having key info stolen than banking login info is? I would have thought not. So this make me think to either store all crypto and fiat account info in LastPass or take them all off... Thoughts?

Excellent input. 
But Circle and Coinbase both offer 2FA. So should i leave my coins there?
I go the hardware wallet to 'be my on bank'. But am I shooting myself in the foot here?

Cool, so in the box is probably a 'data' cable. I didn't even think of that. 
Thanks.

I'd like something similar on how to sell BTC for fiat. Would you be willing to make that too?
