What Would you be buying now if you were an average Joe? Just curious. Maybe Ether. Pretty stable.

Yep. This is exactly what I'm trying to do but I'm not exactly sure how to get any left over coins I would like to keep into a software wallet. I'll have to play around with it.  Do you recommend a software wallet for Mac running Lion OSX?

Sound advice.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:25:24
Yes of course. I'm wishing I purchased more because the price went up $20 in one day after I bought but I'm just playing it safe right now. Thanks for the advice.

I use coinbase so I'll have to inquire about holding coins in their vault one I move them over from Korea. I'd like to save them in a separate offline software wallet as well. And then have a physical paper copy in a different location. Is this possible? Thank you.

Yep. You too? I'm thinking of going to the Bitcoin meetup next week. See what it's all about and hopefully get some more info.

Thank you for the info. I've got the coins in my Korean wallet now. I'm using Korbit. I'll have to look again and see if there was an option  to send the coins to a personal wallet.

I'm aware. But still, it's worth pointing out. :)

So... Who is it?

Is it possible to drag the price down by selling to yourself at the lowest bided price over and over again?  Just curious. Not even sure if that question makes sense.
