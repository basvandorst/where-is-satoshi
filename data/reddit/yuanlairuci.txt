Was very concerned for you for a moment, now I’m chuckling. Best rickroll I’ve seen in a while

If you don't mind my asking, what kinds of skills should I be looking to acquire as a code camp graduate with 7 years of experience as a translator in order to flesh out my resume and make myself more attractive to tech companies? I'm working on supplementing knowledge of data structures and algorithms, but not sure what else I need to be doing to get closer to the entry level CS majors.
If you'd rather not take the time to answer that's cool too, just thought I'd ask when the opportunity presented itself. Have a great day!

I hope it blows up! I definitely intend to start tipping soon for some smaller translations to kind of whet people's appetites. Obviously I can't go around paying market rates for translations I didn't even ask for lol, but I see people on these subs, and even more so on doing translations for free and I just have to think "why?". Even if it's just $5 for a quickie translation, that's something, and I can't see why people can't be expected to toss a bone to someone who just provided them with a service.

That's awesome advice, thanks. I figured my experience translating wouldn't help, mostly just included that to emphasize that I'm already a fair bit into my working life. I built a few small projects during camp but will start planning and looking to build something larger and more long term. I'm hoping to transition sometime within the next year, hopefully it will work out! Thanks again, have a great day!

Glad you think so! I really hope people get into it. One obstacle that the translation community faces is that the average person tends to undervalue the service. Since speaking a language CAN  become very reflexive and intuitive, they tend to think it's easy to turn one language you speak into another, but it really is quite difficult to do high quality translation. Even just a few lines, though it may not seem like much to the client, represents years of study and experience with the language and associated culture. I'd love to see linguists, even those who may not consider themselves "translators" start getting their fair share. Even if it's just a burger worth of pocket change for a five minute translation.

Unfortunately, this is sort of thing is standard Chinese business practice.  As a translator though, reading these emails made me wonder if I should start advertising services in the Bitcoin industry.
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:32:11
It's not likely I'd cooperate with them after this whole debacle. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 10:24:01
op will deliver
@_date: 2015-05-23 16:14:38
I see.  Now it makes perfect sense.  Thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:14:45
The Chinese way tends to be sloppier though and doesn't work very well against any cultural lines. The only reason it semi-works between two Chinese companies is because they expect the same behavior out of each other for the most part. Mix them with any culture that expects transparency, timeliness, and efficiency though and you're in for a boatload of "misunderstandings".

ELI5 why 21 bitcoin represents one of a million?
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:19:31
Same here.  Unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to sell it to pay off my student loans this month.  Really hope the price doesn't jump again before I have a chance to buy more.
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:02:33
Hope so!  We'll see what happens.

I've been for most intents and purposes self-employed for most of my adult life. Some people are good at it and do really well, but I've always been pretty mediocre. I'm looking to find more traditional employment next year for the structure and benefits. To me, having tried the alternative, employment doesn't actually look as bad as you might think.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:48:38
Double standards are typical in China. If you don't respect them you're bulling them, if they don't respect you it's their right to make up for the 100 years of occupation. At least that's the thinking anyway
@_date: 2016-11-04 07:39:51
What they'll do is block connections to foreign exchanges, pass laws to limit domestic ones, and possibly even come up with their own coin and block current blockchain protocols.  It's standard for China. Block foreign things, create a domestic counterparts, and make it so much more convenient that no one bothers with the foreign version.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:09:57
No, this is typical Chinese business
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:20:52
They've got shitty service, but they are huge.

Fuck the Greek government.

I've got native Chinese translators if you need them. Pm me and we can talk. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:54:53
As a professional translator I can't tell you how much it grinds my gears when people try to translate into their second language. Your mother language is your target language. Always. Otherwise you get shit like this and it just looks unprofessional and careless. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:04:11
That's super rare to find though. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:01:51
A one day bounce does not a rally make. If you're playing with huge leverage and this made you a lot of money in the short term then good for you, but otherwise this is nothing to write home about 
@_date: 2016-09-04 19:55:23
Transparency and China do not normally go hand in hand.  If they actually do this it will be a game changer.
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:30:23
This is super cool. Props!
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:12:10
Closer to WeChat or Alipay in China.

Can we make that a thing? "Just my two sats"

Video authentication has been a thing for a while, it just wasn't done natively in the app.
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:44:40
My understanding is that it's at best a grey area for individuals to accept bitcoin as payment. If your contractors are foreign, don't worry about it. No one is going to care enough to check. If they're Chinese they should be a bit more careful.
@_date: 2015-10-18 03:12:28
I do this for my student loans in the states. I live and work in China and getting money out is a pain in the ass, but with btc I just pay a couple transaction fees and I'm good
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:24:01
Because in the interim between the old system and a system that uses crypto exclusively, it's a more reliable store of value than most other coins. Holding all your funds in BTC is great when it's a bull market, but when the price drops to 1/6 you're reminded why we still need something resembling Fiat for the time being.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:46:28
And unfortunately the mobil payments system over here requires a Chinese bank account. We need crypto yesterday.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:44:19
Which is why stable coins are going to be so important as we transition from Fiat to btc. We need to be able to store value in something consistent, then convert it to whatever coin we want to pay with st the PoS.
