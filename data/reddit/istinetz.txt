"I made up an example to illustrate how bitcoin is better. If you point out it's not actually better than just using a bank even in my entirely made up and very unlikely scenario, YOU are burying your head in the sand. Not me. Somehow. Bitcoin!"
I can literally name 10 services that aim to do exactly what you described, except they work. Whereas if you try to withdraw 1 million from a bitcoin exchange, you're waiting a few months at best, if they don't go bankrupt or steal your money. And since there are no exchanges in Africa , you have to use a bank or a financial company anyway. Wooo Bitcoin!

CAUSE ITS FUCKING BITCOIN

The fuck are you talking about
This is your hypothetical, YOU wanted your imaginary person in Africa to receive a million dollars

maybe if you pay me in a currency I can actually use.

The guy in Africa now just has to wait for a Bitcoin exchange to open in his country.

Withdrawing a million dollars from a bitcoin exchange would most certainly take months though. Again, if they don't close in the meantime or steal your million.

I am well aware of that fact. Are you aware of the fact that you can't actually spend bitcoin? So you need to convert it to an actual currency.

Or use one of the many financial systems in use that are faster, cheaper, more secure, and less subjected to currency risk than the dollar-&gt;bitcoin-&gt;local currency path you're suggesting.
Because in the hypothetical he actually uses the money at some point, right?

Okay. How is your Nigerian gonna spend his one million in Bitcoin? He can't buy a house, or a car, or groceries, he can't pay his bills, he can't go to a restaurant or watch a movie, he can't fill up his car. He can only use it to buy stuff online, and you can't survive on hipster t-shirts, mining rigs and drugs.
