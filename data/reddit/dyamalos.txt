I once ordered a case fan and it game in via USPS. They gave it to the guy who lived at the entrance of the drive.
The thing would have fit in my mailbox.

While I like mint, I've been having issues with getting it to work multi-monitor with ATI drivers.

Skype does this too when you call anyone. whoever hosts the call is connected directly to everyone else.
No P2P solution will prevent this because you have to know the IP of who you are connecting to. The only way to beat this is for some kind of TOR-like routing, but that has the potential to degrade performance which can ruin a VOIP call.

My biggest problem is that the people I use Skype with are not as security oriented as I am.
I would love to ditch Skype for something like this, but it would need features that make it much better than Skype for most people to switch to it, as encryption is not a high priority for these people.
Some people seem to be missing my meaning, so I'm going to quote my post from below:










Again, personally I would love to ditch Skype, but it is hard to do so with nearly all the people I use Skype to talk to not caring about security.

What I mean is that for the average person, and probably 99% of the people I talk to with Skype, encryption and security are not factors they care about.
If this this really only has what Skype has, but it's all encrypted and not routed through a central host, they won't care.
In their eyes it gives them nothing more than Skype. They already use Skype and so does everyone they know.
It's the same issue as with Facebook vs Google+. I don't use social media, but everyone who does uses Facebook. No one ever talks about G+. G+ doesn't give them anything new that they want, and everything they do want Facebook already has for them.
I don't know what feature they could add to pull people like this away from Skype, but while encryption and security is enough for us it won't be for most users.

I know Steave Gipson is hosting a copy of it on his site.

Not to mention the infrastructure that would be needed to be installed and vetted for banks to pull it off.
It would be a large amount of money for little pay off.
Honestly you are better off just encrypting the keys for your wallet and storing them in a number of places so you don't lose them.

Honeslty, if anyone in my family was tech savvy enough to understand bitcoin, you'd give them the wallet but they would make their own and pay themselves with the one you gave them.
Otherwise the secret isn't secret anymore as that would mean more than they were in possession of it.
That way you could keep the info just in case they did lose it before they put it in their wallet.

When I was in 8th grade a friend and I were poking around Linux and learning how to use it... on Gentoo.
