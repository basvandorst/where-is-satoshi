Old article but Bill Gates just sent this out through his facebook. 
 
Pretty cool to see (tacit) endorsement from someone like Gates.

Cool. I remember looking at bitcoin a few months ago, there was a significant delay in processing transfers. Has this overcome that?

They spend most of it investigating risk.

Checking this sub out because I was tipped a 'satoshi' today. I think most people that are curious will have a squizz irrespective of the amount tipped. 
Can someone give me a tl:dr of what this community is trying to achieve through this whole malarkey? It would be seriously cool if I could tip someone a beer or whatever and they could actually go out and buy a physical beer. Is it likely bitcoin will ever be that fungible ?

So coins are given public addresses on the blockchain and require a corresponding private key to move. If someone has a wallet containing several coins do they require several private keys?

Price drop probably shrunk my account balance. a taco.

Thanks for taking the time to write that out. You just cleared up so many things I didn't understand.

Great, thanks! I couldn't see for looking. 
It might be a good idea to make this more prominent within the FAQ. Because it leads with 'This posts explains some dos and don'ts about what to post on I just assumed it wasn't the place to be looking for basic answers despite having a link halfway down. I think this sub is probably getting a lot of traffic driven by the  tipping that is 'have a glance at the faq' interested but maybe not 'check out related subs list' interested.
