Hey, I did a lot of research into futures to write this up - if you find any factual errors, just let me know and I'll fix em up ASAP.

Do you mean the price? because I think the basic info is still all valid unless I am missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:40:52
Done! I double checked too - crowd sourced info at it's finest!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:54
can I quote you in the article? As in "reddit user Mav-911 adds this info:"
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:05
Working on that now! That will be much more speculative of course, but fun!

Even worse, I bought 1 bitcoin years ago, and I just checked - it's still one bitcoin! Must be a scam.

Active devs, great social media presence, what's not to love. I hear an updated roadmap is due soon as well.. just to continue the sarcasm.

As an alternative opinion, my trading was not profitable untill I learned to set low buy orders. Sure, sometimes I miss the boat, but many more times I miss that all to common scenario where the price drops the second I buy -  as if the market gods were playing tricks on me. I don't just set my orders at an arbitrarily "low" price, I choose a price based on technical that minimizes my risk. It is a bit of an art. the hard part is when you do miss by just a bit, and you have to watch the train leave the station without you. It takes discipline to stick to your guns, but it has been worth it - at least for me.

Nice! My friend recently traveled to Zimbawbe - you can sell these bills to tourists for about 50 cents, but no store will take them!
