I don’t think a 10x from here is possible in the short term (1-5 years). Just as a matter of scale, the current bitcoin market cap puts it at 4% of gold. A rise to 40% of gold in that time frame would be spectacularly unlikely. Just my opinion.

well, obviously the abuses by the NSA (and others) are a form of tyranny but they don't raise to a level severe enough to warrant armed revolt, thankfully. But you'd have us all disarm ourselves so that we're absolutely powerless in the event that the government *does* cross that line. Given the principles upon which this country was founded, I can assure you that the citizens of this country will *never* allow that to happen.

It's even easier than this since most HTTP requests, even POST requests, will fit inside a single TCP packet (with MTUs at 1500 bytes). So every node just needs a connection to Command and Control for synchronization and an active TCP connection to the exchange server, ready to transmit the request. Assuming there isn't a lot of latency on either connection you could pretty easily get it down to under a millisecond without even syncing the computer clocks. And this is assuming you even need to do it from separate hosts.
- construct HTTP request
- open connection to C&amp;C
- obtain estimated send time from C&amp;C
- sleep till shortly before estimated send time
- connect to exchange
- block until send command received from C&amp;C
- send HTTP request

You are mistaken. Since bitcoin isn't officially recognized as currency by the U.S. government, online gambling with Bitcoin is not an illegal event under the Wire Act or Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. For example, see

So let me understand-- you don't think government should allow citizens to arm themselves, but you think we should use our arms against what you perceive to be intolerable governmental injustice that has no remedy but to be met with force? 
There are three "boxes" we use to fight tyranny: the soap box, the ballot box, and the ammo box. We haven't exhausted the first two yet.

@_date: 2014-04-13 21:53:16
It's very naive of you to think of an armed citizenry in that way. Just because the primary purpose of our 2A Constitutional protections is to defend against tyranny, doesn't mean every tyrannical act by a government body will be met with a citizen uprising, just like our government doesn't deploy our nuclear arsenal as the default response to every act of foreign aggression.
In fact, perhaps you hold such a hyperbolic view of firearms for the same reason, which is to say that you expect an armed individual will respond to each and every confrontation with lethal force.

With all the computers around the world currently working on these math problems, they collectively solve one problem in 10 minutes. That's a tremendous amount of computing power just to solve one problem. It's this tremendous amount of power that actually secures bitcoin. The math problems aren't arbitrary-- each problem represents a batch of bitcoin transactions, so you can't "undo" those transactions without solving that problem faster than this huge network of computers. It will never be feasible to do that. So the math problems secure the system, the miners that solve these problems are rewarded in bitcoin-- the very thing they're securing-- as compensation.
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:09:35
That's absolutely ridiculous. In 10 years approximately 20 million bitcoin will be in circulation. A value of $1M per coin would be a market capitalization of $20 trillion, which would be the entire GDP of the United States in 10 years. All the gold in the world is worth only $6T. The entire M2 money supply is $10.5T. LOL.

To spend the equivalent of $50k per month in today's dollars under those terms you would need $21 million in the bank, or $2.1M per bitcoin if you had 10 bitcoins.

At that rate you're not only living off the 5%, you're depleting the principle too, at a rate that will have you at $0 when you're 90.  You could get better than 5% in the market, but you'd probably be more conservative when you're 65 (with more in bonds, treasuries, etc), so 5% is reasonable, if not even optimistic.

Suppose you're able to live on $2k per month in today's dollars. In 25 years that will be about $4k after inflation. If you increase that by 2% each year (to account for inflation going forward) and, upon retirement, you put your money in something that gives you a 5% APR, you'll need $850,000 to live till you're 90 years old. **So you need each bitcoin to be worth $85,000 in 25 years.** Good luck my friend.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:49:22
Right. You need $21 million USD, so just divide $21M by the number of coins you have.  If you have 650 coins then 21,000,000 / 650 is about $32k per coin.

Looking at the Internet Archive of the 2012 copy of the ArchWiki page on Bitcoin, it does have a section on "How to get Bitcoins" with a link to bitcoin.it's page on Pool Mining.

1. Put TAILS on a USB key.
2. Boot to TAILS, which contains the Electrum client.
3. On a separate (connected) laptop get the Electrum word list online. Pick 12 random words (your "seed")
4. Online, check the addresses that your seed generates. You can use a python toolkit, or an online service, or another Electrum client. Confirm that all those sources generate the same public/private keys as the Electrum client on your unconnected TAILS laptop. Do this with a few different seeds. The purpose of this is to make sure that your TAILS install is not compromised.
5. On the TAILS laptop, enter a new random Electrum seed from the wordlist and write it down. Take the first address. Take a picture of the QR code. Using an online service, transfer a couple bucks to that address.
6. Reboot the TAILS laptop. Open Electrum and restore using the seed you wrote down. Transfer the coins back to your online service.
7. You now know that: A) your TAILS install is good, B) you can pick random words without relying on any RNG, C) when you transfer coins to the generated addresses you're confident you'll be able to get them back out.
8. Now reboot TAILS. On a fresh piece of paper write down 12 random words from the wordlist. Do not enter this seed ANYWHERE except on a fresh unconnected clean boot of the TAILS laptop. Take a photo of the QR code for the first address. Turn off the TAILS laptop. 
9. Transfer coins to that address. The 99.99999999% only way to access those coins is by using the seed on that piece of paper. Put that piece of paper somewhere VERY safe. Those 12 words are the only way to access your money.
10. Once the piece of paper is in your fire-proof nuclear fortified safe, you can keep an eye on your money using a watch-only wallet or just linking to that first address in a web browser. 
11. When the after-tax value of your bitcoin exceeds the balance on your mortgage (as bitcoin value increases and your mortgage balance decreases), sell the bitcoin and pay off your mortgage. One way or another, God damnit, your bitcoin is going to pay off your mortgage.

I do not think that is possible, my friend. Even if bitcoin took 20% of the gold/store-of-value market, took a full 50% of the ecommerce market, 20% of the global money supply, 100% of the black market, and 100% of the remittances market you'd be at something like 150k per coin, and those are extremely ambitious numbers.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:08:05
Yes, the "store-of-wealth" market is an $8 trillion dollar market. If bitcoin captures 20% of this market (which is profoundly optimistic) then that translates to an approximate per-coin value of roughly $50k.

You also have to pay state and local taxes, depending on which state you live in within the U.S. The rates vary from state to state. In some states there is no tax, in some states the state tax on gains (and income) is quite high. This is in addition to the federal taxes that everyone else is referring to in these answers.

Add up all the money you spent buying bitcoin and then divide by the number of bitcoin you have.  If you spent a total of $450 buying bitcoin and you have .07 bitcoin, your dollar cost average is $450/0.07 = $6,428.

You're including the coins being offered at $10k. There are only 595 coins right now available on GDAX that are **under** $10k. Once demand burns through those we'll see the $10k price print.

With stocks the smallest amount you can buy is generally one share, so stocks split to keep the share price down. With Bitcoin you can buy fractions of a bitcoin, down to 8 decimal places. There are named units of smaller denomination, the smallest of which is a "satoshi."  One Satoshi equals 0.00000001 Bitcoin.

Global wealth is currently at $317T USD according to the Global Wealth Report (as of mid 2018). The top 1% own 45% of this wealth, or $142T.  There are currently approximately $17.6 MM bitcoins in existence (not accounting for non-spendable coins). So if the top 1% put 1% of their wealth into bitcoin today that would yield a price per bitcoin of about $80k.

It would be mathematically impossible to give every person in the US 1 bitcoin.  It would be mathematically impossible to give 10% of everyone in the US 1 bitcoin, no matter what the price is.

@_date: 2017-09-01 20:22:58
Yep, you should have won. If someone provided a range he should have used the midpoint of the range as the actual guess. In his example, the guess was 100 - 200 apples, the correct answer was 199 apples, the range guess should be considered to be 150. The person who guessed 201 is within 2 apples, the person who guessed 100 - 200 is within 49 apples. 201 wins. Otherwise, the best guess is 1 - 100,000, because then you win if no one's range hits. With this approach you were off by about $32 and he was off by about $66 -- twice as "wrong," in fact, as you (both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of error).

But it can be altered because those coins can be provably burned.
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:52:43
Actually, this is essentially how bitcoin works! The "proof-of-work" upon which the blockchain is built is based on finding a value that makes the hash of the block come out to something specific, just like you described.  The "difficulty" specifies, roughly, how much of that hash must match something specific. To match the entire hash would be phenomenally difficult. So difficult, in fact, that for all practical purposes it's impossible today.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:18:07
...and not even a hint of sarcasm.

Even if Electrum stops operating, the algorithm they use to generate the wallet from the seed is well known and widely published. There are existing open-source standalone tools that do this. The fate of your coins is in no way tied to the fate of Electrum.

If you place a market buy order on Coinbase Pro they will give you the best match from the Coinbase order book (i.e., the "best" price for your bid) and charge you a 0.25% taker fee. They do not charge any fees on the withdrawal - they batch them up and pay the transaction fee themselves. I would be very surprised if CashApp or anything else could beat that.

If you're holding USD on Coinbase that has cleared ACH you can buy bitcoin and transfer it out immediately. Not sure why you had to wait 6 days. Maybe you deposited cash and it was made available for trading but not for withdrawal until your deposit was settled.
