I should have bought yesterday you'll say tomorrow like you say today. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:28:36
Sounds like a horrible idea but I support it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:27:31
takes a little bit of time for the confirmations to come in. Just wait an hour or so and check back.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:19
 can we get this trending? Hah.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:24:20
yup! I buy and sell bitcoin on local bitcoins. You can buy as much or as little as you want. many people set minimum buys though
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:04:38
I did. I also bought more though

Welcome to bitcoin mother fucker 
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:01:47
rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. IMHO I don't think it's weird at all.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:15:41
I don't carry on my ankle it's on my hip, and yes this scenario would be different. I wouldn't put myself in that situation though because any transaction involving cash or bitcoin transactions would be done in a public area and under surveillance(coffee shop or outside of a police station). The point being don't be stupid and follow someone to their car to get cash. Either they bring it with them or walk away. I have been selling bitcoin for a while on Craigslist and localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:57:44
it's the reason why I obtained a CCW. I sell a ton of stuff on Craigslist and every transaction has gone smoothly. I haven't had to use my gun and I hope I never have to. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:17:46
not if it's concealed
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:46:58
It was during halftime
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:56:04
This is why I carry a gun to every Craigslist transaction I go to. This exact reason!!! I don't care if you're selling xbones or motorcycles you need to do it in a crowded space. A coffee shop or the parking lot outside of a police station. Places with security cameras.
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:59:36
If the gun was already out pointed at me I would most likely comply. No sense in getting shot making a sudden move. You would have to guage the situation. Does this person really want to shoot you? Read their body language. Do they look crazy or desperate? On the off chance they do start shooting... how could I position myself to best find cover and avoid vital organs. Are there cover situations and places to run to? Where is the quickest exit. 
The whole idea of carrying a gun is to use it as a last resort or when your life is threatened. If the guy has the upper-hand already there isn't much you can do but try to talk him down or seek cover at an opportune moment. I suppose you could go for it while reaching for your wallet or something and seeking cover. This isn't a movie you should avoid conflict at all times and should attempt to escape harm in any way. 
It's hard to say what I would do because every situation is different. Every setting is different and the skill level of the threat could vary immensely. I just have to rely and hope that my training and tactics in handling a situation like that are better than the assailant.

just hold on man it's gonna be a wild ride.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:38:14

I kinda want to buy a car with bitcoin now. I wonder if their auto buying service will let me buy with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:01:42
I want to buy a jeep and paint it orange with a big bitcoin sign on both sides that says I bought this with bitcoin! lol

Dogecoin just had a massive jump this morning. I think it's worth mining.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:01:45
I'll ask because I love you &lt;3
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:52:19
took a big loss from mining equipment. A jump from 250 - 400 would ROI me. I don't mind waiting.
@_date: 2014-12-31 22:23:53
I sold 100 xpy at 0.0688 at the spike. This is so fun 
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:12:40
OOOOH MAN I just got the email! So freakin excited for this.
Edit: Ok so I added my account. You can't really do anything other than view your coinbase balance... Kinda useful in that I don't have to check the CB app now for balances, I can just look at the USAA app. Would be nice to have a buy button and to select an account the funds will come from on the USAA side of things though.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:43:28

me too! They even helped me out back in sketchy wire transfer days!
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:54:23
I traded altcoins and doubled my investment rather than holding btc and waiting. I am not feeling the burn as much when all my BTC is now profit. I cashed out my initial investments.
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:15:00
Everything I want on Amazon I check overstock first before I buy that item. Most of the time I can find a similar item or the same one on overstock. I love them.

The nsa is still a government agency. These agencies hire fuckin idiots most of the time. Throw enough idiots and money at a problem and that's how things get done. I've been in gov contracting for years and have seen some real dumb shit like this. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:01:40
Yep. It's stress free if you believe in the technology why not stay in for the long haul. If you really need cash you can always sell without issue. I have sold a bunch on craigslist for great prices.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:06:20
It's fine just keep buying. I've auto bought $100 every week for 4 years now. Profited the entire time.... Profited more bitcoin that is.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:50:49
Just the way bitcoin goes. Supply and demand. This price was inflated already market is correcting again. Guessing we'll see coins in the 800s by next week 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:03:55
Sent a sketchy transfer via western union to some guy in China who then sent the coins. Never actually got scammed believe it or not. Still have my first bitcoin ever bought on a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:10:36
Congrats on retirement! I am still pounding away... I would say that crypto is only about 5% of my portfolio though too most of my investments are in solid funds that I can control. Wife and I plan to retire at 50 though if all goes to plan. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:36:19
Yea, my wife and I live on 30% of our take home pay haha we always joke about being too poor to do things even though our nest egg is ridiculous and house is paid off... Good mindset to have I guess.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:22:52
We have 3 homes bought with VA loans 0 down no PMI. They're great for rentals since it's all controlled by the military. Constant stream of cash. 2 of them will be paid for in the next 5 years while the other will be gone in 10. Rinse and repeat!
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:41:51
Lol what? This is just how bitcoin works. Keep on buying and quit yo bitchin fool!
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:46:02
Daily buys at $5 for me. instead of getting starbucks everyday I toss it into my btc account. I am still up even with all the rises and falls.

Lol someone lost a lot of money 
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:06:19
Hodler here. Been hording btc for almost 6 years now. Still have my og paper wallet with my first coin in it. Other than that the trezor holds the vault. Yes I cashed a large portion of my holdings at about $17k but I've since bought back in. Took the wife on her dream honeymoon back in February. Life's great as a hodler. I no longer have my cash in the game since I pulled out my roi a long time ago it's all monopoly money to me now. If it crashes to zero tomorrow fuck it it was a blast. Not trying to get rich, blockchain is the future.

It's a good way to get more fiat which is my goal.

$100 weekly buys over 5 years has made me a very happy HODLer. That said I buy and get out very frequently as well.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:50:00
I don't mind paying taxes at all. I actually welcome it. I'm still buying though not going to stop until I think the time is right. My trezor is locked away far from my home and in a safe place. Paid off my student loans though

What exchange allows you to buy 100 coins? Not saying you're lying but I don't know of any that will do that kinda volume.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:17:14
I am an opportunistic bitcoiner... I get in big and get out big. I do have some for long HODL(my weekly buys) however, I know that I can make small gains in the meantime by riding the waves. I bought 10 btc around 1700 and got out at 2000, bought again at 2200 and out again at 2500. Made a bunch of small profits while keeping my main holdings. You can do it how ever you want though. The tax man will come knocking though if you do quick ins and outs like I do.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:03:27
I have made $50,000 buys and sells through coinbase because that's my limit. That's no where close to 100 coins. I don't even know an exchange that matches that volume... them fees are a bitch though.
