Meh, at least his stats actually use the same time frame. The OP used two completely unrelated periods beyond that they both end with the present day.

Just adding to your comment. I agree with you

Prisons, railways, housing for the poor, healthcare, military, insurance*, the list goes on and on in favour of things the government *can* do better than private business. It mostly depends on the honesty and integrity of whoever's on charge, regardless of the path taken to get there, unfortunately.
*Insurance is a personal pet peeve of mine, since (car) insurance is a legal requirement I believe it's unethical to allow private business to compete over how much they can fleece the public for.
At the very least, there should be government mandated maximum tariffs allowed, in order to prevent companies from artificially raising prices. The same should hold true for health insurance in the US system, but I haven't lived there in a decade so I can't profess to know enough about how it works these days

No, but rolling on impact can disperse a helluva lot of energy.
Many years ago, I took about 2 ninjutsu classes before I went to juvie and they both focused on jumping off scarily high heights and rolling on impact to not break bones. 
I feel like the procedure would be similar for shedding off speed too.
