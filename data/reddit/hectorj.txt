I think you made the same mistake I did : forgot the 'm' in "msatoshis".

The study is lacking.
They don't give their "single machine" specifications for example. It could range from a Raspberry Pi to a high-end server

Here it is : 
Some notes :
- There is two pieces of code to copy, the javascript and the html, I delimited them with comments
- the percentage is rounded up to the nearest integer
- I already put your fundraising address and goal in the parameters
- that code works but is not as clean as it should be. Ideally the script should be in a separate file, and the inline css ("style=[...]") should be integrated into existing css files
- I should add some error handling. What do you want to be displayed if somehow blockchain.info API is not responding ?
Edit : final note : the data used is the "total received" by the address, not the current balance (it doesn't care if you spend some of the received BTC, they will still be counted). That can be changed in a second, but I feel like it's the best behavior

Keep in mind that it's not part of the protocol, and that every miner may use a different implementation of their choice to prioritize transactions.
Now, if we're talking about the "reference" implementation, I think what you want to look at are these line of codes : 


As I understand it, the **last** criteria for prioritizing transactions is indeed by fee
So your transaction with 1 satoshi fee has a *slightly* better chance of getting in a block than one with no fee at all, if none of them have a high enough priority
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:37:19
Has it been stress-tested ?
How much can it handle ?
I'm skeptical, CloudFlare is more than just software, it's also a huge infrastructure
@_date: 2016-03-09 01:39:55
But those running **full** nodes would profit from thin blocks, and without having to run this relay network on the side, no?
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:39:26

The only alternative I know in Vietnam is  with "2.5 % + 13400 ₫" (and their price is often above exchanges, for example right now it is at 13 189 000 VND ~= 588.6 USD while bitfinex just jumped to 585.8 USD).

They can keep working on the "Core" repo.
XT has already been rebased a few times on Core new versions
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:21:44
"rebase" here is a Git term : 
When a new version of Bitcoin Core is announced, Bitcoin XT can just redo their changes on top of the new code.
Like this Bitcoin XT benefits of all progress made on Bitcoin Core, while keeping its specific changes.
This has been done before and will keep happening.

btcd hasn't fully catch-up with the network yet (I started it recently) so comparisons are probably unfair but here are the numbers :
So far btcd has 10 connections, using 103 MB of RAM (
My Bitcoin XT 10.2 has 79 connections using 939 MB of RAM (
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:12:24
hmm, what does the logs say ?
    tail ~/.btcd/logs/mainnet/btcd.log
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:20:50
I don't think that's entirely true: a non-mining node with RBF disabled won't relay the second "doublespending" transaction, no?
Still it would probably make little difference, as some other node will relay it to the RBF miners
@_date: 2015-07-19 03:15:26
    btcctl getinfo
But you need to have setup rpc before that. For example, in ~/.btcd/btcd.conf I have* :








and then in ~/.btcctl/btcctl.conf :








After setting these configuration you need to restart btcd, and then with "btcctl help" you can get all possible RPC commands.
It seems 11 is btcd's equivalent of bitcoind's 8 (I just remembered I have some kind of firewall setup by default on that server, I'm gonna open the port right now)
If you have some trouble do not hesitate to ask :)
*Actually I have setup TLS with a self-signed certificate but it's not very useful if you keep RPC on the local interface

@_date: 2016-02-22 05:57:20
- Define "the network". Miners? Full nodes? Miners, full nodes and lightweight clients?
- "get the approval to run your code" =&gt; Gavin was criticized just for getting some code out in the open for people to run if they want, so not everyone seems to agree that this is the way to go.
- Define "overwhelming majority". Some seems to think 75%+ is enough, some seems to want no less than 99%, and there is some in-between.
I see nothing clear in this.

My point is that it is not an optimization, it is a size limit increase comparable to a 2MB bump, just done with a soft fork. 
You're not fitting more groceries into the same trunk. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:39:06
But it does not compress anything, it just counts the witness data as 1/4 the size it actually is.

And I maintain this point, given that it is an arbitrary increase in block size done via an arbitrary discount on how some data is accounted for =&gt; accounting trick.

Edited my [orginal post]( to clarify
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:36:26
Just a note : the immediate capacity increase is an accounting trick, not an actual optimization (from what I understood)
Edit to clarify:
It does increase the number of possible transactions in a block, but not by optimizing (ie. doing more **with the same resources**), but by making blocks bigger. The "accounting trick" being the part where old nodes still see 1MB blocks because part of the data is not in the standard block (that's what the "segregation" means), and new nodes only take in account 1/4th of that "segregated" data size (this being referred to as a "discount").
Also, that doesn't make SegWit bad, I just wanted to clarify.

I suppose you already know that group :  (I'm not very active there, because as said before I don't know enough Vietnamese).
Do you know if there is some Vietnamese laws (foreign currency or trading regulations) which could apply to Bitcoin right now ? I'm trying to know if any business could start accepting Bitcoin with no problem, if they need some authorization, if it's a grey area, or clearly forbidden.
Thanks for your work.
