Wait and see I suppose. There's always a leak in the damn. If they tighten down hard enough the leaks will spring. Oppressed people can be pretty innovative.

I paid $385 and I’m doing well. We had 3 properties, 2 vehicles and 2 children at the time we split. 
It’s called being an adult and working it out.

They're just driving it underground. The Chinese won't give up crypto profits over something as ineffective as a government ban. Bureaucrats! Pfffft

How can a global debt ever be satisfied. 
The current money system is really a debt slavery system used to control populations. 
It’s all an illusion and a control construct. 
If interest and debt keeps accumulating where is it coming from and to who is it owed. 
Answer: it is being created from nothing by a small group of elite globalists. 
The current money system is the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on humanity. 
It’s run by criminals doing criminal things. Causing wars and division among people who would otherwise co-habitate on this planet in relative peace. 
In closing, fuck the central banks and their fake money (debt), fuck the bankers who prop up the scam and fuck the governments and their legions of enforcers who oppress their own people for personal gain (whether financial, personal or political)

You Paid $5k for an uncontested divorce? 
WTF? That’s a $300-$400 application to the courts if there’s nothing to squabble over. 
Lawyers and government. Leeches!

You get it. Now there’s two of us. Lol

���� the banks. Pull out all your cash and see how their business works for them from that point on. 
Their days are numbered. It’s like watching a beached whale try to roll itself back into the ocean. Pathetic. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:47:44
Pretty much. 
That’s what I’ve done.

The fed (all central banking cartels for that matter) have perpetuated the greatest scam in human history for centuries if not longer. 
How people can just accept that a private corporation has been given the authority to issue our nations currency and loan it back to the people to whom it belongs while charging interest is beyond me. 
I woke up to the scam years ago and can see now that taxation is theft, the interest penalties and fees they extort from us is theft and private central banks are the scam running it. 
Their time is over. Out Freedom from their debt slavery money system is here and once enough people wake up, we will take back control of our lives and leave them to rule over an empty house with no authority and nothing to offer. 
They're dead already, but I don't think they've figured it out.

Keep reading and you'll find most of those reviews are geared to move you into another money making scheme that the poster is involved with.
Sounds credible up until the "but wait, there's more..." moment.
