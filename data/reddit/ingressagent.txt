Well said. +1

This seem like a good article for Bitcoin

Now I'm seeing all kinds of holes in his story.

Hodling for 15 years does sound like a really good idea. I would recommend occasionally exchanging &lt;20% of your hodlings for fiat or spending the crypto on things you need once in a while. Just some common advise I see posted around here. Good luck!

I think it's about the pre set buy/sell orders people have in place. $10k is a significant number to trigger a lot of sell orders. But who knows how many people are waiting for any kind of tiny dip then they'll buy in big. Hard to know

Next stop Mars in 2018!
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:37:07
That's true actually we all forgot the moon is a part of mars so we going to mars at least

I would not sell. Buying more is always good though. So hard to time it out. Easier to make mistakes doing that than if you just hold. Once your up 400%+ start taking out small chunks to play with. 
I'm no expert, just relaying what I've read around here in the past. Good luck though!

I wanted to do this. Can I just use BTC I already have in a wallet and divide it into 2 or 3 small parts and put on paper wallet?
Really been meaning to look into to figuring out paper wallet. Some quick video I'm sure exists
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:30:56
Buy little more when you can. Keep holding. Be well off
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:14:19
This gave me a lol thanks for sharing
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:10:18
I first bought in before the significant September dips. Didn't phase me, bought more. Laughing now 2 months later, great gains on my small investments
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:18:27
Any well kept listing of online merchants accepting crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:25:59
And again at $6700! Ha. Mind you I'm only throwing in ~$40 at a time. I don't have as much disposable income as I wish I had right now 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:02:17
Bought one last time today at $6470. Must stop buying. Making this note mostly just for myself
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:15:11
Good find, really
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:47:36
Yea that's the thing. In 2 months I'm up over 550% on VTC. BTC only ~200%. Other alts I'm doing fine on. One of them totally shit the bed. So my entire portfolio is only up ~220%. Going all VTC would have been way crazy gains but if I went all BTC I'd have had less stress/playing markets for the same outcome
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:09:11
I'd say more like 1993. Mass adoption isn't even near being realized
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:43:42
Dang, sorry friend. Think you'll buy again? Still early days for crypto. Wait for a nice dip
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:32:33
Some now, some later, again 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:50:26
I like this theory
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:10:18
100,000 new coinbase accounts were created between Wed-Fri so, sort of yes. Probably not all grandparents but regular partners and siblings and aunts and uncles buying a bit or two!
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:23:04
Yea I'd never unload 100% of holdings. That seems crazy. Exchange like upto 20% of holdings for cash to pay for debt or things you need. Still keep vast majority of holdings for future growth
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:25:47
What does a crash even mean? It will dip or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:26:00
That guy on the left thought it was a right fucking joke that Amazon could even be worth what Sears is. Lol and a half

This post reminded me of 2004
Remember when you first got Facebook? It was like this. You maybe thought it was neat but not many people have heard of it.
Then you would overhear someone mention Facebook while you are out in public. Then it became regular. 1 billion+ users.
I think Bitcoin is like that now, how Facebook was back in 2004. Didn't make much sense then, but once everyone and their moms had it you signed up too.

Wonder where the bottom is this time? Bought a bit at $7100usd and a bit more at $6900usd
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:24:44
I also advise yes. I've been grabbing bits of BTC since the dip
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:34:39
Nope. Buy moar
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:32:29
Just hold. Too hard to time your sells and buys. It'll still go up long term
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:29:52
This time last year if you slammed $100 down for BTC it'd be worth $1000+ today. Few hundreds can make a few thousands. Few thousands can make many more thousands. I wish I had $10k to throw down but not willing to go into debt over it for now
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:20:56
It is all, for sure, wild speculation. Nobody can know what the heck will even happen. Check the trends, charts usually have trends. But even that means very little.
I say grab $50-$100 of BTC or whatever. See how you like it
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:14:41
I started buying just $50 or $100 here or there. Timing is nice but waiting can be costly. I've been spending more than I should, but every month that passes I wish I would've dropped more in!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:16:32
This is a good guess. Weekends are usually slow with a good Monday morning bump. Since this weekend has been pretty huge, I say Monday might be mega moon
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:21:41
Sell 25% of your holdings at a time. That way you cash out some gains and don't lose out too much when it keeps going up
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:58:59
Hey reading your comments from earlier. Very helpful! Just wondering if you could explain. Coinbase seems to only accept Visa &amp; MasterCard where I'm trying. Am I missing something? How to add more fiat for BTC? Could be country restrictions
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:48:01
I say it dips again when China wakes up. Wait a few hours then buy

So everything I have sitting in my Coinomi App is ideally best not left sitting in there?
Is there a quick single wallet I should use instead? Printing them onto paper, I heard that is a thing.
I want the nano s hardware wallet. Should probably order one asap.
Im only holding ~$200 worth split pretty evenly between btc, eth, ltc, vtc, bta
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:15:27
That's a great point. Thanks for sharing it. I've been changing some fiat for cryptos for a month or so now. It's super fun and portfolio is doing well!
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:59:51
This article is mostly good until the last bunch. Really don't see a scenario happening where BTC goes back down a lot, ever
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:26:38
I don't think it's the bottom yet. Hoping for better discount maybe later today, tomorrow, Friday. We'll see
