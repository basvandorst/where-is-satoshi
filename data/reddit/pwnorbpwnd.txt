Canada to be specific. It's not like I really care, if they catch me whatever, oh hey sorry *swat of the hands* I won't do it again, pay a fine and be on with it. Also, I don't buy coins, I mine them.

I NEED to, well not need but I'd like a chunk of my power bill to get partially paid, a couple of kwh isn't much to cry over at .10c/kwh here  but it's nice not paying for bitcoin with my power bill at the end of the year being 5 times the estimate every month that my power company throws at it.

Always remember this, as any newbie will have the misconception of ''I have to have a full denominator of coins.'' For example 1, 2, 5. You CAN buy 2.2 if that's all you have. But anyway, to answer your question find an exchange online near you. Assuming your in US I'd go for Mtgox to buy or sell coins, you're in Canada go for cavirtex. Both exchanges have several options for appying money to your exchange account like depositing into a specific account they have at a bank or through services like Dwolla, etc.

Different architectures, CUDA cores in Nvidia were definitely not built for SHA256. AMD/ATI on the other hand, they specialize in that, ever since the 5000 series they have improved(cut out 6000 series, they're par).

That site is a piece, it says I'm not in Canada. Bull, I'm in the dead center.

Hmm.. Sooo, it's technically under the category of tax evasion then.. How in the hell would you pay taxes to avoid this?

I highly recommend everyone pay caution when persons with no reputation try to open a business.

I was having a nap and woke up to my phone buzzing away from texts telling me every post that Josh made today and I saw that he was actually confirming the packaging and damn near shit myself. 9 months and almost there.
