I’ve listened to Alex here and there over the years just out of curiosity and for a laugh. The guy sounds and acts crazy all the time. I remember about 10 years ago when he started saying the global elites are going to start ushering out over 70 different genders in further effort to emasculate men and destroy families. I thought over 70 genders? Things like cis gender? Zim and Zer? I thought, this guy is so bonkers nobody’s ever going to adopt that crazy crap. So I got a laugh and stopped listening. Fast forward today,  if you don’t use people’s preferred gender pronoun you can go to jail for it in places like Canada and California etc..  The guy’s delivery sucks, bad, he makes a clown of himself, but he’s said and predicted a lot of crazy stuff that turned out to be true. Yes he said Sandy Hook looked like a drill.. he didn’t ask anyone to attack families or call for any kind of harassment or violence. Conspiracies are what he does and you can’t be 100% right all the time. It’s terrible that there are crazy people out there that harassed these families but can you really hold Alex accountable to the degree that he’s being held? Yes, retract your theory, apologize (which he did) but other than that prosecute the actual people that harassed the families. Anyway, he’s the biggest to be banned but there are tons of other people that have been banned recently as well and I’ve got to be honest, it’s really really creepy. If something big goes down like trump being taken out one way or another (not a trump fan) false flag terrorist attack etc.. these are all the news outlets you’d want gone. As I type this I realize I’m sounding like a conspiracy nut but yeah.. just had to get it off my chest. It’s weird.

It could take years to fix yes, but I don't think it will hurt bitcoin. Coinbase isn't getting 50-100k new users a day because people want to buy their coffee with bitcoin. It's because they're looking at it as an investment / store of value, like gold. The vast majority will be happy to hodl and watch the price continue to rise until LN or whatever else kicks in. That being said, I totally agree it has major problems and the fees are ridiculous.

Well here’s a link for the California law,
I actually heard about the Canadian law from Jordan Peterson, not Alex.

I think it's a great question I'd like an answer to as well and it shouldn't take hours of research to answer. I'm a noob too... I keep hearing about how bitcoin is better than banks, but my bank charges me 0 fees for using my debit card to buy something and it's instant... doing a simple transfer from coinbase to my ledger wallet takes several minutes and costs me high fees. To me it just seems like digital gold or something. I bought in at $2700 so I'm pretty happy but I don't understand why it's touted as so much better than banks or the best crypto compared to things like IOTA with zero fees.

Ok, there seems to be a debate about the specifics of the new law in Canada, I’ll give you that. But you said my links, as in plural, prove your position. Can you dispute the California law?

That’s weird enough for me. My only point was that Alex had talked about the 70+ genders/pronouns years before it came about. He didn’t predict any jail time I had just seen the headlines. All the support for children getting chemical and surgical gender reassignment that has come along with this is troubling too. Anyway you’re right, no need to go on here, and no need to get angry friend. Cheers!

It really just seems like digital gold for lack of a better term. An investment / store of value. Sure you can buy things with it same as gold but it doesn't seem like the reason people want it. The thing that sets it apart from gold is it may never stop growing in value. It's this weird new thing.

Someone heard the same podcast I did and already asked the same question, no answer there either. 
The podcast is: bitcoin knowledge podcast and the part is at 36 mins in of "how to protect and profit from upcoming bip148 Fork" on June 13th. For anyone who's curious to our confusion.

I heard the same podcast and asked the same question here. I was told I'm speaking word salad, lol... did you ever find an answer?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:26:27
Thank you for this. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:39:59
I'll take that as just transfer my coins from coinbase to my ledger and don't worry about "network validation" as I must just be confused about something I heard that is totally unrelated. Sorry for the noob word salad.

Could you recommend a wallet? This is all alien to me, thanks!
