Future predicting is impossible.  But!
My voodoo says if the trend continues . . . price spikes mixed with bubbles which collapse to higher lows . . . followed by higher highs . . .
Two years is possible.  IMHO.
Network Effect.  First Mover Advantage.  One million new users a day within months.  Wheat from Chaff Separation.  Wall Street and Silicon Valley $$$ and brain power.  Market Building.  Intense Developer Attention.  Madness of Crowds.  
Imagine if you could have bought a share of stock in "Internet" twenty years ago.  Not Compuserve or Netscape or Prodigy.  But a share of the "Internet" itself.  
Now imagine that you did not have to have a brokerage account to purchase this stock.  That you could purchase it by phone or with cash or through a bank account.  And that you didn't even have to purchase a whole share.  You could purchase just a tiny bit of a share if you wished.
And that this share purchasing power was available to anyone living anywhere in the world.
What would a share of "internet" stock be worth today?
I don't know.  But, I figure a lot.
Of course, Bitcoin could be replaced by something better and flame out.  It's possible.
But, I think this unlikely for all of the reasons mentioned above.  IMHO.
I believe in Bitcoin and the people who use it.

If so, and you believe there is no chance of parole, boat or fly out of a neighboring country ultimately landing in one where there is basic internet and where the weather is good (for those nights when sleeping indoors is not an option).  Check treaties regarding extradition.  Check Localbitcoins for a presence in that country.  That will make life possible for you.

Moral of the story:  Central Bank of China has run out of words.  It's legal but . . . it's unsafe . . .but it keeps rising in price . . . 
They have nothing left they can do or say that will not incriminate their credibility regarding BTC.  
The next bubble will be all the proof the Chinese public needs regarding the "legitimacy" of Bitcoin and the illegitimacy of their Central Bank's opinion on BTC. It will be a clamoring rush by the Chinese to get into bitcoin  that will be the fuel for the next bubble.  And the next.  And the next.

This is a very heart felt appeal and it resonates. . .
If ny wants to retard themselves regarding btc development, fine.  bitcoin is the money of the people.  We do not ask anyone's permission to use it.  No one told us we had to use it.  It is as free as the air and nothing short of pulling the plug on the internet will stop it.
The only ones scared by regulation are the big money folks.  The whales.  The ones that want to go along to get along.  The ones that want mom and dad's permission.  
It is a mighty big world out there and what new york does will be viewed as important by some state governments in new england.    Maybe in london.  But not by People.
Bitcoin is a Juggernaut. Best thing to do is get out of it's way.  Darwin was right.  As we are about to find out.

Localbitcoins is fine for $60.

I trust paper.  But, I am over 40.
The bugs in paper: fire, water, mold, insects, rats, oxidation, manual desecration.  
I feel confident I can prevent all of these from hacking my paper wallet.
Because . . .
 . . .they are well understood, after dealing with these issues for millennia, remedied by ever increasing levels of preservation, backed up by highly motivated institutions which are focused on preservation of paper; libraries, governments, and such.
The bugs in software and hardware are beyond my ability to comprehend. 
What I do know about both is that after about 5 years, they get buggy.  There is little remedy for this, so the solution is to "update" or "buy new".  This may not work for all things bitcoin over time and so I stick with the legacy tech: ink on wood pulp.

Yep!  I was talking to "help" at Coinbase today because I couldn't find a way to pass BTC directly from their site to a paper wallet.

My bet: Josh wrote the lawyer letter.  
An idiomatic broken syntax, common in non-native English speakers, difficult to replicate and indicative of this particular writer's voice, is evident across documents that should "sound" completely different.
Read quote  then immediately read the lawyer's letter.
They are in the same voice.
IF both docs are written by the same man, this is troubling because it reinforces the central thesis of the OP: Garza will misrepresent himself extraordinarily at the drop of a hat.
