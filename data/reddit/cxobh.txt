Every good thing doesn't have to be a response to something bad. 
Acceptance increases gradually and understanding improves as people examine fundamentals carefully over time, realization dawns that misuse of centralizing power and authority has brought greater pain than the benefits it was formed to bring. What is so bad about a commonly verifiable public record of transactions?
I'm hodling because I expect people like you to understand over time.

We will see - nothing is for sure - there's a lot of motivation to not let decentralized ledger based currencies survive. It could all be for nothing and everyone may lose a lot of money and faith. 
Yet it could be the other way around right? Cryptocurrency may gain strength as a reliable and stable form of currency. Let the dragons settle down after they've wasted breath and money.

Look my friend, centralized control hasn't helped. Decentrlization gives each individual the control to reject ledgers that act like governments or politicians. A common public record of exchange of value that cannot be subverted per convenience. The control is implicit in the use and participation.

Could I ask you to qualify your post by saying "IF they pay for the social constructs" instead of "as they..."
You make a presumption about the accountability of government spending.

Agreed, it a does try to overcome the concentration of mining centralization. It wouldn't be prudent to reject the whole idea because one implementation failed. We'd all have to give up currency since the Vzuela one failed. There is a long process of evolution ahead shortened only by the accelerated pace of innovation. Still want to be stuck with withered tree pulp?

The government elected by the people of every country chose to provide guarantee on face of a piece of paper. The same people chose to male cryptocurrency a representative form of currency to reflect value of the world 's tradeable resources and a medium of exchange of value to bypass the governments misuse of power and control over currency. Do you have a problem with that?

We the people, duh!

Why does the law allow law enforcement to take innocents for granted?

And yet bullyingeveryone isn't alright. If you withhold someone, they should have the right to know under what suspicion they have been withheld and what is the course of expected action. The withheld needs to be given a chance at proving their innocence before being harrassed.

Because there is no free lunch (or dinner) outside of the government
