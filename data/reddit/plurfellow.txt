Well, someone tipped me with it and I'll give it a shot. My vendetta was in how it came about mostly and I like reddit because I can have multiple anonymous accounts with no outside connection or identity attached.
The original bitcointip held true to that notion being private and closed ended. I don't know enough about changetip to say one way or the other but linking my facebook is a no-no OR I want to treat it like multiple addresses + throw aways.
As I said too... I've tipped over hundred people in the past and I think I estimate ~$2K in total tips over two years or so. I didn't, and still don't, want a new system.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:07:56
For user adoption on people like myself... I would prefer another option to your service to never need to interact with your website or linking of accounts.
Literally copy what the bitcointipbot did and if I want to start linking accounts with a shared pool or add facebook, etc, then I can go to your wbesite at a later date.
I just received a tip and the process (and wordiness) of the message, then going to your site, then linking, then being dropped off back at your site with no BTC deposited (hasn't been deposited still)... it frustrating.
I would want a service I can run out of reddit and messages with the option to use additional features. Maybe then your business model could sell premium accounts for linking multiple reddit accounts together to 1 wallet, etc, for your more advanced users.
I'm sure you have your own business ideas and direction, but just to put it out there... I've tipped what I estimate ~$2.5K since the bot came around and fully stopped after this change. I am not as comfortable with the lengthy process required by your service nor do I think it's as simply effective for me tipping out to someone else. So, I'll probably still not use this in its current state.
My purpose as a user isn't to tip across all of my social media accounts... only on reddit. And I want the simplest and most private way to do that. Even just going to your site gives you more access to my whereabouts and information.

This is true, but using total in circulation / market cap isn't correct either. Really, it's the yearly transaction volume which will also take into account total bitcoin that traded hands.
A house sold for bitcoin contributes to this but the seller could spend the money elsewhere thus doubling each bitcoin's productivity. In that case bitcoin's total circulated value would be much higher than current market cap.

Startups are comprised of many types of people. I would say most tech startups - especially the good ones - don't stay on top of twitter because it's annoying with low return on time invested.
So, it is not uncommon for a startup (likely a busy one) to let their twitter go for a week or month. Once they have social media people hired full-time you will see consistent management of online presence.
I just don't think you've likely followed a startup that is this early stage. Tech startups like Uber or something are a long ways down the road already. Series A, B, etc.

A currency is obviously worth more from wider acceptance. This is a key component of why USD is so valuable - you can go anywhere with it.
Could you re-read your statement, you've now said the same way twice, and find a better way to get your point across? It doesn't make sense. "just because you list your home for bitcoins doesnt magically make bitcoins worth more dollars"?
Are you talking about the price going up from homes being listed in bitcoin? If so, you are thinking too narrowly. The reason the price went up is because the media reported on it - which gave bitcoin more exposure, more trust, and told people are real things you can buy with it. It wasn't the house itself that effected the price.

Bitcointip integrated and posted a direct transition over to changetip. It was forced but that doesn't mean it will succeed. I was peeved by the whole thing because throughout my accounts I have tipped over $&gt;1000.

The pricing model for these companies will be much more cost effective since, unlike paypal or VISA, they don't need to do the calculations in-house and they don't set the rules. Microtransactions will need to occur within a closed environment closer to debit/credit cards. Coinbase already does this sort of thing.
Right now, when I think of bitcoin's place in microtransactions... I relate more to how I have come to utilize it. If a blog, a charity, or various other tip-type methods exist for me to pay, I'm more likely (much more likely) to do it.
I'm waiting for a video game to show a QR code at the end or various other types of new business models / revenue streams.
Generally - we don't know what will become of things but I see the direction it's heading and the potential of it all. Bitcoin, and/or crypto, is going to be a huge thing as it continues to rapidly grow (the infrastructure / user-base).

Fair enough but I am more peeved that we were shuffled off to a worst product, with a worst name, and more steps to the process. Bitcointip was simple and worked well.


No one around here cares about the alts in any positive sense. I am an altcoin supporter as they have other purposes, better communities, etc, but people tend to stick to one primary currency. A bitcoin user tips btc, a doge tips doge. I don't see mix-matching.
Even then, the name "change" tip is terrible.


I haven't tried change tip besides looking into it and have no experience with it nor the incentive to start. If they create a side project or something that is as simple as the old bitcointip then I probably would.

Bitcoin-purists interpret the "reason" for altcoins to exist to be because of some minor benefit over bitcoin - that isn't it. It's completely driven by greed, excitement, and the longevity of profitable mining.
That said, those are true market metrics be it Bitcoin, stocks, flipping a house, or anything. The industry around alt-mining is huge and allows the average joe to get involved and turn a profit.
This is all a competition. Bitcoin should develop things that make it more useful in the real world to mass users, companies, etc... not spend time to *hopefully* integrate their competitors.
If you owned altcoins and bitcoin said, hey destroy your blockchain plz, would you do it? Hell no. They are their own industries. "You have to use bitcoin to get into dogecoin, though!" Yes, and you have to use fiat to get into bitcoin - what's the point?

Keep in mind these are physical exchange devices, not cash dispensers.
A regular ATM takes your USD cash from a bank and dispenses USD denominated bills. A Bitcoin ATM does a conversion for you - an ATM investment vehicle.
The robo ATMs that only do cash are purchased for ~5-6K. I would say, given the amount of exposure and business these oeprators receive, and the function as an exchange market (a lot easier than building a new MT Gox), that $20K is pretty damn reasonable.
Anyone saying otherwise for now fit into: Haters.

In general, it's not fair to compare any dollar statistic to bitcoin right now. The two have completely different purposes and one is **4 years old**. The market share we're talking about is a future one, and only then would these conversations make any sense to have.
So, what is bitcoin currently good for? 
- Buying various things - especially online,
- Buying has no risk of fraud, identity theft, counterfeiting, 
- it's good for moving money internationally, 
- holding money personally &amp; privately, 
-its an interesting speculative investment, 
- it opens you up to a million other very interesting speculative investments, 
- mining altcoins is less speculative with a predictable ROI, 
- third-world country can accept it easier than any other online transfer / payment service, 
- it protects Cyprus, Venezuela, Ukraine, and any other civil unrest country from gov. seizure,  
- It enables you to evade taxes, which can be a good thing or bad
- it enables someone from China to liberate a small piece of their wealth from monetary control
- It is super lightweight, transferable, divisible, transparent, decentralized, fair, consistent (the technology, not price), and more.
I'm sure I could continue along. Just those are some majorly disruptive attributes. What other technologies in recent memory has this sort of progress or potential?

I would be more "worried" or interested that the Chinese government will create their own coin. It matters the originating rules, but it could be a good thing. They want to push a global standard, but probably wouldn't want an unknown like Satoshi coming back to effect its adoption. Done properly, it would be a huge market disrupter and their support would likely have everyone buying the first ones as fast as possible. I don't know if they'd go as far to disrupt the other currencies, it would likely have random and catastrophic effects. Would they use bitcoin's fair mining distribution or equally distribute them to their socialist citizens?
The major players in the US government are no where near a point of creating their own bitcoin. If it happened, it would be a secret operation from the more secretive groups and it would seem like a normal alt-coin that eventually was also the US's.
This isn't going to happen because of politics - those they represent won't be early adopters and likely against the idea. They represent their shareholders and technology-wise some top lawmakers can barely write an email. If this occured, banks would be the ones pushing it through. It would be tied to the USD as to not destable themselves.

Here's the thing... giving bitcoin is nice for both parties involved but the value of the tip bot is in the show it gives.
A person writing +# internets verify *looks interesting*
People have fun with it, non-accustomed users ask what happened, we get to have another big bitcoin conversation hijacking other threads, and anyone wins.
You can add stuff like that to your own tip program but next I see your other benefit, coinbase, as a severe bottleneck. Many users, especially on reddit, don't like tying their identity to neither reddit nor BTC. Does your service imply a person can't tip someone without a coinbase account? I think that's what you're saying which completely defeats the purpose of tipping muggles in other subreddits.
If you want to create a tipping service... you should understand what makes the other ones so good to begin with. Work hard and best of luck, creating stuff is constant learning curves.

[Even the long-standing bitcoiners are turning into zealots]( This is becoming a self-righteous religion, where we are the good guys, yet marketing a highly volatile security so our price continues to raise for basically no reason.
The thing that is incredibly messed up about all of this is that... by pumping bitcoin and advocating it, we advocate it based on the high growth potential of wealth. Very few of the newcomers are doing it because they follow the original crypto and libertarian ideals.
So, we're selling snake oil to hopeful onlookers. Even by advising 14 year olds to market it to their parents. It's become morally questionable, which is a new feeling for me within this industry. I can't imagine how many people bitcoin has destroyed because of foolishness.

There will be two types of bitcoiners: 
1. one that abides by the law, especially when bitcoin exchanges fiat - these will be the people that create long-term businesses, contribute value, and potential mass acceptance.
2. the one that wants ZERO government and is very vocal about that point. This will lead to the general public's fear/disgust of the currency and the price will reflect that. Your revolution will never make it past a keyboard.
I am from America, am a libertarian, and love bitcoin... but you guys sound fucking nuts most of the time. Even if the end result is complete removal of financial power from governments (which, good luck with that), this world with no government would not be better. It's been a long time since I've heard this group discussing ways to make the world better in the short-run by utilizing the inherent benefits of BTC protocol. You sit here, waiting and bitching, then when a seizure happens because rules were broken you go ape shit.
Long story short, find a rational middle-ground. The effects you want are already baked into the cake. Think of yourself as a friendly settler talking to the local Indians, if you'd like, rather than walking out guns drawn.

A lot of it also has to do with how broad the term "bank" is. For instance, a casino acts as a bank in many ways (loaning, vaults, cash on hand, etc) but is not considered a bank. They have the same, and other, money laundering laws to report to due to the nature of its business. Someone that accumulates up to $10,000 in transactions on a given day meets the requirements for money laundering protection and so all of their gambling needs to be tracked and accumulated.

If your business runs parallel with other industries that require "know your customer" laws, this really isn't an issue. If you are part of a service with implied security, then this definitely effects you. 
Bitcoin businesses, and other businesses for that matter, are all based on the assumption of your private information. If you use a trade, expect to be known, it's a requirement and those laws are in place for safety.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:58:43
1- China's financial services and banks are not allowed to touch the asset. This restricts bitcoin from one of the largest industries in the world, and the direct "enabler" of bitcoin companies to exist. In Canada, you can not find a bank within their oligarchy, in America it is nearly impossible and companies keep their US banks as a trade secret.
Banks may be less motivated to talk to bitcoin companies. I feel the repercussions just beyond bank's additional market cap (and, we're dealing with currency here... banks shoudl participate in the future). More regulatory pressure, lower upside benefits, and/or less use *is a bad thing*. (Although consistent with our culture credo, against our price which we seem to love talking about)  
In general this lets us know the government does not want it used as a currency and is willing to 'ban' bitcoin-related industries.
3- Remember, this is all my interpretation. The price, with the same services we have right now, was relatively steady around $120 last. Silk Road turned out to be a positive in media, which seems to have carried further into China for whichever reason. China fueled this growth. Our reason for the price was "china's transactions backing it, when would/could that ever end?".
The last two other parties that entered were sideliners from the last bubble (better investor class, more responsible), and complete newbie speculators / don't know of btc / never seen a bubble / still arguing with me. The money they put in vary but you can see with the transaction volumes up the slope... that people were holind BTC rather than trading it more or spending it.
So... the growth with these players hit $1,000 and could never bounce past gold. The transaction volumes were so low during this time, you would stay seeing some scary swings. I expected this crash. What I didn't expect was China's news which also showed us how little the market is over there compared to what this sub tries to portray.
4- As I mentioned in the previous comment. There have been very little addition true BTC companies to come into existence since then. The ones he have, grew, and new merchants joined, but I doubt they even got a single sale during this time. The true economy probably weakened if anything. I don't follow that stuff but the Sheep Marketplace had to have weakened confidence even in the black markets.
We need more companies that introduce BTC's inherent value to corporations, entire industries, and/or more companies that do the things we know work - exchanges, remittance, ATM, etc.
Also - I have been following this for about 4 days with great success. 
People, like they do with other things they're emotional about [ie: relationships]) act the same way. Bitcoin isn't all that different regulatory versus a Paypal, Google Wallet, Dwolla, etc. It also isn't that different from commodity trade or stocks - especially given the lack of real world use yet to mature. 
Again, this is just my personal stance.
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:40:32

You are very young, there is no need to be buying into bitcoin at this time.

If you make this investment, and it tanks, you will never hear the end of it. This isn't worth the stress for you. If your priest is using BTC as the hot topic to talk about, you are just setting yourself up for a bad time.

Everyone here, for the most part besides the people selling things, merchants, or startups, are speculators, investors, and users of the bitcoin currency. None of them are entrepreneurs and those that think they are have a really narrow idea of what it takes to meet all of these legal, monetary risk, investor relations, day-to-day issues, software development, so on that others here are doing.
People also refer to the code-base in a "we" plural usage. No, it is "them" doing "us" a great service.
I do get what you're saying, and the passionate user-base of bitcoin will help guarantee success, but the majority of people around here act as if they contributed anything more than some words on a screen accompanied by self-interest buying/mining.

The reason these banks are choosing to do this stuff isn't bitcoin-specific or against you. It's not out of fear of bitcoin itself, it's government fear.
Bitcoin is associated with a large money laundering and "financial crimes" risk. They don't want the headache or paperwork. If you read financial industry news or went to Money 2020, you'd realize bitcoin isn't the only new technology going after seamless global transferring. This sort of "safety risk" is a blanket fear for all banks/companies right now.

Sticking true to some pure ideal may seem noble but you'll just go down with your own ship. I think they'll all succeed at varying lengths. Diversification is a good thing and BTC isn't bulletproof.
The scarcity of BTC remains true and there is no changing that. This multi-coin working against BTC's scarcity is a new argument and completely shallow one. 


Pure speculation. Bitcoin has big financial player interest, companies (including mine) working to provide across all industries, and brand value. Also, no one gives a shit to learn about bitcoins anymore, they just buy first and panic later.
Stop being so afraid of some altcoin taking market share, and work towards increasing the real value of bitcoin. The value proposition and price is now dependent on corporations, remittance, and other real world uses. Go make something that oil industries want to use BTC for.
On the flip side, if a coin was created that made utility tracking and payment significantly easier/automatic, was better suited for cross-national oil purchasing, had accounting principals built in, or various other escrow or properties that created value - bitcoin would be in a lot of trouble. There is no point in taking a break to fight competition at this point.
Also, I have a lot of respect for Eric but he's the last person to listen to on this. Any loss in current and future BTC price directly effects his net worth.

So a cash store. That isn't revolutionary or motivating. You are just adding another payment option, and you should do it if it's simple, but I can guarantee a flood of users won't come. It may make me hear about your game once, but it doesn't catch my interest and really thats a service you provide to your real target audience.
A *revolutionary* game like the one I described may entice people to 1. buy your game, 2. buy bitcoin, 3. seed said BTC into your game (this funds the natural economy itself... they put BTC into your game, it's their real currency players trade with... and you just collect on people repairing their gear and stuff.)
The in-game cash store credits for BTC won't do you much good in terms of marketing. I can almost guarantee you'd be underwhelmed.
That said - just ask your potential userbase what they think (they've given you their emails, right?) and maybe you'll learn they want it.

I suggest also subscribing to the nice folks over at It's the best place to get free and **unbiased** feedback. 
Also, entrepreneurs forget that they can go prove their value, make a dollar, crowdfund, show interest in the concept, and just about anything else even before they even have a developer. It's not necessarily the best path, but an entrepreneur's job is to just **go make things happen**. If your resources available says: I can't build the next ultra-secure exchange, then look at said resources and pick something people want that you can do.
Success = passion and passion != success. So, go test a new idea every day or every week until one sticks and shows a ton of positive feedback. If you have momentum and show you're capable, you can find a developer.

Agreed, I personally don't support illegal activities and believe the laws - even placed on BTC - should be done by the books (which, right now should be very little but isn't). I like to think of the good laws can bring, and am troubled whenever the alternative motives seem to arise.
The Texas scandal decision is good for bitcoin and consumer protection, I believe BTC users deserve protection. However, I hope the laws used and put in place allow for an entrepreneurial mindset.
Regardless of one's belief in bitcoin over the long term, there are applicable uses that provide value (currently, I believe international liquidity is one such use). I really feel at angst with the BTC community's opinion of government at times, but also feel overwhelming anger at times from how governments act. Overall, I think all markets should return to more open and competitive regulation that protect their constituents.
On a side note, there are many legal things sold on SR. I wonder what laws are in place that require companies legally liable for products others sell on their marketplace?
@_date: 2013-10-15 18:00:19
They can co-exist in separate markets. Also, bitcoin companies for the most part are betting on the success of bitcoin as are their VCs.
They should ask themselves if they are gambling their investment on bitcoin or the companies themselves. It's definitely bitcoin. So, do they worry that there will not be a market for this? Maybe there isn't but there is evidence that there is.
If it all works out leetcoin will have grown enough and tested enough by the time bitcoin hits more pockets around the world to be in a defined market leader position. They can also increase this opportunity by doing cooler stuff than those other companies - which the flexibility of bitcoin and being a startup enables/offers them if they take advantage of it.
So, do they want to fund this company's opportunity to be a market leader or not? This is why bitcoin investors stick to their packs - the other bozos don't know enough.

It creates a new financial instrument tied to bitcoin. If used correctly, it will provide a new alternative for hedge and fund managers to invest Joe Shmoe's 401K into.
That manager may just want to invest to diversify and not actually deal with the regulation and buying of actual bitcoin. 
Are there really bad worst case scenarios? Yes. But those twins would be in for major crimes if anything too fishy happened. Them being so publicly known is a very large trust builder, and at the moment building BTC press is probably their main goal.
Thank you, Winklevii twins. As far as I am concerned, you are doing us a solid until proven otherwise.
EDIT: I may not have made it completely clear either... **they want to market it to wallstreet and portfolio people**. I'm sure a single investor can purchase too, but we all will probably just stick to our real BTC. Really it should just add liquidity.

The thing in common with all four of your examples (and SR is unharmed... so... why'd you add that?) is that they were/are doing illegal things.

In all honesty, what you did builds character more than tuition will teach.
College in its present form is all about having an experience and getting a piece of paper so companies will even look at you for a job you'll likely hate. Follow things you care about and/or learn to write code for the easy win.
Do not, regardless of what your parents may say, get into large student loan bills. If you are a driven person, go to whatever is cheapest and come out a free person still.
If you are extremely intelligent, go to an ivy league and meet people. If you are somewhat intelligent, got into an expensive pretty nice university - do not get student loans under any circumstance.
That is my advice.

Assuming it was a statistically improbable win... the business model of slots takes into account jackpots and they *should* recoup it over time. This is just a gambling business risk, but again statistically they should be ok in the long-run. There are laws in place in gambling that require a casino to maintain a proven amount of cash on hand that ensures the company will stay in business regardless of 99.9% of statistically improbable circumstances. A new company like this, however, could potentially go bankrupt due to a few lucky rolls.
Gambling law and the Nevada gaming board, are one of the few circumstances of government that I really support. Their main goal is to progress gaming internationally, require safe business practices (which the online gambling thing being slow is a result of this... currently they are enabling it and testing), and to protect the image of gambling as a whole. 20 years ago, gambling was a very negative thing, and now it's a family trip destination to gamble. That is primarily a positive thing the gaming board and Las Vegas marketing did.
They are also lenient - something I wish financial and federal were. For instance - they will let you offer gambling, offer gambling services, and what-not after you apply for required licenses. So, you can be up and running day one while they analyze and "vet" you. This sort of approval by allowing/watching/testing is uncommon and very cool for entrepreneurs. At the end of 3 months (or if opening a casino, one year), they will approve you and you continue on without any more needs from your end.
Back to Justdice: for an example, an undisclosed casino opening once had a whale come in its first year and gamble an excessive amount (I can't disclose but... it was insane). He won that year by a lot and drilled a hole into their P&amp;Ls/earnings. However, the year after, he lost big and net result was positive.
Regardless - the lesson is that even if things look ok in an excel document, you should only offer levels of gambling that you can stomach and is financially safe. Smaller casinos won't let you pull a slot lever for $200k each but larger ones will. And yes, there are players that drop excessive amounts per bet... that is not a ficticious $200k.

You may think this is a good idea, but take note from Uber's constant legal troubles.
You have to become as large as possible to have an active seat in the legal hurdles. Bitcoin is doing a pretty good job in terms of growth and the news surrounding it is substantial. You don't want to fall out of the press when you already know you will have large enemies. The media is the perfect place for this battle, too, since banks/credit card cos/financial institutions try to stay out of the news as much as possible (for good reason too).
Do you see a bank openly accepting BTC companies? No. And the ones that showed interest? Stopped. Why? The laws haven't really changed, so what caused it? Whispers behind closed doors. Market makers pushing the pin in their direction as quietly as possible to make it more difficult for this to grow.
So - yes, the things we want are baked into the bitcoin cake already, but you definitely don't want to be a $1.5bn market cap (tiny tiny tiny) with **no** voice.
Think of a game-changer in technology in the past and how rapidly they took over / caused the downfall of their pre-existing market holders. This technology has to follow that same path. 
Now... aggressively defending bitcoin or attacking other's opinions are never cool and never get the results you want. Actually, it's almost always detrimental to the point you are trying to convey. So yes, stop with that if you see it.

Another ridiculous story the media will not understand, blow out of proportion, and increasethe cycle of misinformation. These headlines are a real disservice to their readers, as one commented, "I wonder if this is going to pop the Bitcoin Bubble that is going on right now."
Most of our transactions are closely tied to to the originally mined bitcoins. Thinking that connection is significant is a complete misunderstanding of what the blockchain is / does. 
What we have here shows an early adopter, moving money to fund Silk Road purchases, in an "irregular" quantity.
It is not irregular to move 1,000 coins when you likely have 100,000s to throw around. This "news" and research is more white noise.

Bitcoin's market cap is ~$2bn. This is smaller than my mid-size city by many multiples and a blip on the financial or corporate radar.
I am extremely confident that any purchase made into bitcoin, whether it crashes or not, is going to eventually be profitable. There may be some critical error or reason for its demise, but I am now also confident in bitcoin's ability to resist negative media/events.
My point is... people can ruin themselves with bad trades but buying in a long position should be fine. People will make a lot of mistakes and this is a higher-risk/bad time to buy. If in doubt, go long.
@_date: 2013-08-11 10:24:31
I'm just saying there is no real downside to them adopting it. If they think its too political, I think BTC has bigger fish to fry rather than us trying to buy their acceptance.
I don't know their financial situation, but Bitcoin Foundation did a really great thing with their non-acceptance of CA's law against them. I would prefer to support movements that remove the greylines in law. That and things that educate more people on bitcoin's real benefits, potential, and use.

On an everyday tape measure, we have taken baby steps in regard to actual infrastructure and acceptance. Gyft was a great value-add and I really believe BitPay is the bitcoin staple company right now.
I actually think a lot of Joes like having Wells Fargo protecting them from fraud and going to bed at night with the (generally correct) feeling that his money is safe and accessible. Also, Joe probably doesn't want to learn something new and definitely doesn't care about cryptography. The discussion of cryptography in itself, although I think we both believe in it as a necessity for the future, is a looney-bin topic to most people. Hell, a few years ago I had no idea about it, and bitcoin I've known about since last November.
Some places I see real benefits - right now- for even the common person is through globalization, travel, and potential investment holding. Sharing the bill and paying back a friend is really simple and nice as well.

The regulations already exist. These players aren't claiming their earnings nor loss, and specifically not from a gambling income perspective. If they are, I would be surprised but I don't claim to know everything.
Will the government crack down on IPs from US to these sites? I don't see why not. I think internally, online poker will become more and more legal over time and as the concept (and business owners) are intensively vetted out.
Heres the thing... to own a casino or get into it from a gambling business perspective, the gaming board vets the shit out of the owner/board themselves. I doubt it matters if I go into details, but for safety, I'll just say it's pretty intense and a long process.
They vet the owners out to protect gaming industry's image (which used to be negative), and the players using their services. Poker websites are a proven and great economical feat, but from a regulatory and industry perspective it is important to know the owners, audit them, and create a sustainable market.
Their cause and regulation is completely supported by fact, after the whole poker debacle a few years back. People are trying to get rich quick, skipping laws, and doing whatever the fuck they want. The gaming board will ensure proper business structure (casinos are really corporate and boring!) and that all laws, regulation, coding, %s, and etc are fair and ensured on a regular basis. I will applaud the gov when they have a fully entrusted, stable, and fair online poker economy. That can only come with time, testing, and preventative rules in place.
**Gambling in America is one of the few industries I can say is continuously looking out for the players and the industry's image for economic reasons.**
Currently, they seem to be testing poker in Vegas. You can gamble online in Nevada with Nevada poker sites.
fyi, OP's question is pretty dumb... but was asking about bank rules rather than regulation. Banks I'd guess can do whatever they want and has nothing to do with gambling in general. Gaming board is pretty legit so far.

Unless lobbying takes place, there isn't any real benefit for them to be pro-BTC. The benefit of following regulation is keeping your ass out of jail, assuming you were breaking a law (which many btc companies are, or are waiting to find out if they are).
The benefit of being diligent in the regulation process is getting your story out/education and having a part in the discussion. I really hope no one thinks that an exchange won't/shouldn't be regulated...
An exchange should be regulated to protect the customers using it (have we forgotten bitcoinica, false pricing, insider trading, etc), and an exchange is regulated because exchanges have existed long before bitcoin made owning one in your basement possible. 
I think we can all agree it was shitty to see the large sell off of insider bitcoins right before CoinLab announced their lawsuit.

That's funny coming from a BTC user.
Here's the path I see with LTC:
The creator now works at Coinbase, they will likely have some sort of vested interest.
His brother works at BTC China, more interest.
The volume of LTC is enough for many trades to already have accepted it. MTGox and various other ones will likely finally deliver on it. Liquidity and exposure will increase, people will see a "cheap coin".
All of the noobs around me say BTC is "too expensive". LTC is commonly said to be the silver to BTC's gold, this is a great position to gain more credibility.
Said noobs will see the "cheaper" bitcoin, buy that instead. ..."Need to get in early, I missed the boat last time!"
Entrepreneurs will start getting more involved with LTC, and/or add it to their BTC products. Now that liquidity is there, they can just as safely deal in either.
Profit. Multiple currencies can and will exist. I'm sitting here glad the BTC I put in a week ago is now double. This comment pushed the price down, I bought back in. What will the future hold? Who knows. *with either*

I wish tech companies would come together and agree that forecasting revenues is unnecessary. There is no way to accurately project their revenue or EBITDA in this type of business. It's not a restaurant with endless comparables to base it from. Also, expenses will most likely be above budget, but those are a lot more predictable.
I'm in corporate finance and there is just no way I see this bank doing break even during the first year and EBITDA flow through of over 50% second year. I don't know if that's a red flag, because this is obviously a document prepared for investment, but it isn't even realistic to me.
For those numbers they would need... 
- A clean and non-problematic launch
- Cooperation from partners of large institutions
- A customer base
- BTC to pick up momentum again

We are likely entering a nice calmer phase of upward trend as new companies announce BTC acceptance and the last hype-machine settles. I would be very happy if the BTC price crashed momentarily, but I don't see that happening.
There will either be another bubble within 6 months or consistent extraordinary growth. I actually, finally, bought my friend litecoins. I had "noobs" in RL ask me about them. I believe people psychologically want whole numbers and that BTC seems "too expensive". People are going to figure out their other options.

If you look and keep up with bitcoin volumes and charts, the twins could dump their coins easily without too many issues.  Just that aspect alone makes this a null problem.  Buy/sell walls and timing come into play, but they wouldn't be the first to sell that much, nor the last.

- They want as many board members as possible - which totals hundreds.
- They want you to pay a large amount for various membership tiers with seemingly little benefit.
- The entire website is built to sell membership and pump their agenda. 
-Their agendas have no focus, cover a multitude of futurist  topics.
- They show little to no progress, details, campaign, or other in any of their multitude of topics.
- They rank top donors on the bottom left.

Well the timestamp and number of confirmations is the most important part. If by meaningful you mean significant to bitcoin, then I believe the way currently in use is best. That said, Proof of Stake would be a tremendous improvement and help guarantee the longevity of BTC.
If by meaningful you mean for humanity like folding there are altcoin(s) that already are doing this I believe. At the very least I've read discussions about it. And I agree there. This would also be a tremendous value proposition for the technology.
It would be incredible to allow researchers to purchase computational power for research. Opening the technology to those types of input could be extremely dangerous though. What if someone could "buy" computational power for their DDOS / bruteforce attacks / ect.

It looks like more and more people hoarded this time, so the price went up as the supply went down. I could even sense from my friends, colleagues, and online that people were strictly holding.

I wanted to check your hemorrhage comment. Although, their stock news is currently positive - they are losing money compared to last year. Their margins are thin and becoming more-so. Hemorrhage is the wrong enough to be "false".
* GAAP net income was $15.6 million for the first quarter of 2013 versus $16.4 million for the first quarter of 2012
That is on... 
* GAAP results for the first quarter were $154.1 million in total operating revenues
~10% margin and becoming worst. That said, their transactions business and cardholders are both up each quarter. If your comment is hoping for future hemorrhage, carry on Wayne.

No. It's a way to leave your BTC holdings without going to fiat. These arguments in this thread are exactly what BTC users combat the past 3 years! Funny how the tables turned.
I am BTC supporter and entrepreneur. I look at LTC, as mentioned, a penny stock, but a penny stock I understand the technology and has major upside potential due to its positioning and relation with BTC.

I believe the real opportunities lie in focused applications in business. Although I agree that there are viable companies within the scope you mentioned, I have been playing with an idea that would run parallel and be a better option for real businesses within an industry (not as a store-front but actually in conjunction of their business model).
Those opportunities you suggest, will probably come, but will be like picking the twitter within a bunch of investable social network startups.
My biggest problem right now before I push "GO", as I've been reading all applicable laws and reaching out to people within FinCEN law practices, is that I have come to understand a balance of launch versus legality. To play within America, all of the laws need to be met, which will cost at least 20k I guesstimate just to become licensed + lawyer fees + reporting in place + audits set up + etc, and that will enable me to run business as I'd like to (legally). Next, as someone that figured out bitcoins use within my own industry... that would require me to lose my job (even from an angel, I'd want minimum 1 year run-time) to be successful.
So... launch versus legality must be executed like an artform (Uber vs transportation unions + regislation, for example) but sadly we also have the spotlight on us currently. A startup needs to launch, push and grow as fast as possible to show it's value, then pursue legal implications as the clock strikes thin. That said, the initial legal fees and licenses known still need to be in place before tranferring money for customers.
Sorry that this is long winded, but it is a large issue for potential startups within your focus and I hope it is helpful. I would be open to discuss my idea if interested, but also knowing the worthlessness of ideas versus execution, it is hard to even begin executing when I don't want to land in legal hell a year from now.
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:05:37
At the very least, it is doomed to fail because anyone who actually gives you money now will have a large majority of the coins in existence. This is assuming you actually do things in an honest way.

It really all comes down to pure speculation on all accounts. I wish we could pull all of the investment speculation out of the price and see real world use.
What is the real market size of remittance, paying people back, the mining, merchants, and so on? 
I'd imagine both BTC and LTC would have a very low mtk cap in terms of actuals. So, both are likely speculative of their future, and their prices are based on that anticipation vs risk. They're really in the same boat.

My guess is it will drop... but my guess isn't really worth anything.  I think the sell/buy we saw was either the visual exchange of USD --&gt; BTC away from gox/dwolla or the price was rebounded by people wanting to keep it steady somehow.

Well, you don't see any recent posts criminalizing Texas for prosecuting the bitcoin scandal that occurred this week. So many hypocrites in this crowd.
Anti-competitive laws and all the mini-laws that convoluted the system and were put in place by lobbyists, are absolute bullshit, but the premise of requiring businesses and people to be upfront with who they are is for protection. BTC has yet to successfully create a web of trust and anyone can (and constantly does) run with the money with no repercussions. That's disastrous when you consider the goal most here have of mass adoption.

Holding dollars or gold doesn't make you entrepreneurial anymore than bitcoin does. Try to argue with yourself otherwise while the real entrepreneurs in this community work their ass off to increase your price.

We want people to buy bitcoins and use them to purchase things and transfer money.
Someone smart enough to figure out how to buy in, holding, then running away scared is not a good thing no matter how you look at it.

The total size of the network now more-than doubles every month and has seen 10% growths per-day. Even long before the latest craze, the bitcoin network was faster than all supercomputers combined. It's a monster and the only formidable challenger would be quantum computing... but if/when that becomes reality then all computing, security, and all money will be compromised.
This power, combined with the distributed/decentralized nature of computers on it, makes bitcoin extremely improbable for attackers. The question really isn't whether someone can successfully 51% attack anymore, but rather, can a country / group of people maliciously change how computers work which could hypothetically cheat the system.
NSA can't beat the types of crypto used in BTC, but it can "cheat" by compromising how computers generate random numbers.

Yelp and Linkedin is already taking on too much unless its done very eloquently. So, make the Yelp features you want and add the Linkedin features with **laser focus on user experience**. Let the users decide how they want to use your site. December, I imagine, is a very unrealistic launch date too.

It is 0.6% of total bitcoins (at 21mm) or 1.1% of current outstanding. That equates to $49mm being dumped at current market price. There are $160.7mm recorded transaction volume (USD) per day that take place on the blockchain, presently.
This sale would be largely positive news (new bitcoin returning to the market, get them cheap). The price will largely be unaffected and will likely cause the price to increase after it settles. 
The biggest effect will be from the headlines that FBI is selling Silk Road money. Idiots will sell because they don't understand numbers, while people like me buy. 
This is all generalized forecasting - but what do I know... all I have is this lousey career in finance.
Real forecast: FBI (if they sell) sell it to private buyers through auction. You won't see the entirety hit the market at the same time and those buyers are likely hoarders anyways. I know, I wish they would dump them too. Give me a good price, at that time, so I can continue on this rocket to the moon.

Since it is their money, they know the technology, and they have the additional finances to do things properly... I'd imagine there will be a super complex method of offline storage. The money should have very little risk since I doubt they'll ever need to touch the stuff online.  It's a derivative of cold stored BTC (I assume).
These simple questions are most likely the ones they answered first. And will have a presentable solution when investors are asking them.
EDIT: A good question would be... who will audit the funds? Will the addresses be made public?  If not, how will we know what's there? If it is hacked and anon, who will ever know if they have the funds or not?
@_date: 2013-07-03 00:06:08
Anyone around here can vouch: Bitcoin is not easy to obtain (they literally stated this was a reason for making the ETF)
Bitcoin is expensive to store in a risk/expertise way. Assuming they don't shoo you away, try to teach a random co-worker or person within an investable age group how to securely store their BTC and use it at a later time - it's cheap until you lose it. And, holding their coin on a trade house is even riskier.
There are a lot of reasons a person on wall street would prefer to buy this through Winklevii over the endeavor of buying real BTC. A more geeky person that thought this was all cool, would probably want to invest on their own.

Since no one has been capable of an intelligent reply:
These ATMs are an amazing contribution to the bitcoin community. They solve a MAJOR problem of the initial fiat --&gt; BTC transfer process.
The machines that only do fiat to Bitcoin will be released first due to legality issues.  The companies will need to be an MSB in every US state they are present in, so expect a tiered launch.  This should be an anonymous way to convert cash to bitcoin, but I am not positive on that fact.  
Reasons it may not be anonymous is due to money laundering laws.  Any invested amount or combined amount spread across ATM machines totaling over $10,000 are required to report it.  There are also "know your customer" laws in place that I am not sure how they effect this ATM process.
I expect it to be a rocky road for these companies due to # of users in an area, them actually using it, customer retention rate (will they come back, was the experience a good one), expenses of security and cash collecting, and the big dog... legality.
If the exchange price is reasonable, however, this will be the way I purchase BTC.

This is a big deal for them because of money laundering.  It is their job to protect US currency from criminals, and they're not going to just let this be an internet safe haven.

He completely disregards the growth rate of our infrastructure and likely future of it. Money from governments have existed a long time, but it has not stayed constant. This same argument could be made about when the world governments left gold standard 40 years ago. A lot has changed since then including its own instability, a loan-based system which cripples our youth and parents, and over 90% of value lost per dollar. They held the gold bag back then and would still be if they didn't spend it already on wars.
This currency is mathematical. Regardless of Satoshi himself cashed out, it would recover because the underlying truths would remain untainted. This author would be screaming "TOLD YOU SO!" while I would be buying cheap BTC.
Ponzi schemes don't have a userbase that is so dedicated to a mission of liberty, fairness, and the removal of *at least some* power from those that want to give you loans while also taking away your buying power with printing presses.
This isn't a ponzi scheme. It is a very new and highly volatile currency / commodity +/ security, which has the market cap of a mid-level corporation and only 12 million full shares to give out.
Place your bet, I know I have, as well as my friends and I working on bitcoin companies to continue building the infrastructure - funded by the currency itself and/or others that were *early in*.

There have been two sides to this community since the start. The arguments heat up and chill out based on price and overall positivity. We *mostly* all agree the technology is awesome and in general libertarian views.
Sorry to be the voice of entrepreneurial reason but if you want to financially disrupt large industries you have to follow the laws that govern that place you're reading this from. The features we all can agree to want, are baked into the cake already, and will exist regardless. You are the early adopters, and if it all works, you will have the financial influence that comes from it. I'd venture a guess many wouldn't be any different if you had
What do you think the bitcoin foundation does? Whether you like it/them or not, they are facilitating and educating our way to hopefully not be hunted like witches (in the US).
You all love seeing investment news, love seeing the price go up, volume up, headliners to disrupt this or that, the news that TX court will pursue that scammer, but you think you should play by different rules? Get real. You have to slowly work hard towards something to make any real change. Too many of you want instant gratification, both politically and from price, as you sit behind your keyboard. Show some damn respect to the entrepreneurs trying to overcome banking, subpeona, legal, liquidity, price change, negative-stigma, moving countries, and all of the other great tribulations they are going through.
This article is completely tin-foil hat shit. You source one article and your personal opinion, you obviously have not met or spoken to many of the leading figures in bitcoin/btc companies. Also, an **investor's** perspective on anything is a terrible mindset to base your argument from. Investors are all type-caste the same when it comes to this stuff, they may think BTC is cool but the don't give a shit about the political side. It's all upside money for them.
Great brainwash piece you have here, though. Why don't you cite some actual btc entrepreneurs in it or reach out to them for quotes like a real journalist would.
Yes, this is a wall of heated emotional text because as an mod and long-time bitcoin supporter, pieces of literary shit like this pop up bashing the people working their asses off to make this work.

While reading his article - a gyft advertisement to pay with bitcoin was next to it on the screen. Gyft enables bitcoin users to shop at tons of stores, which carry tons of products, all around the world. 
This is one company. Coinbase and Bitpay both broke over 10K merchants months ago and separately, and Coinbase + Blockchain combined have reported estimates of over a million active users.
Large companies have adopted it and many more will soon, people are finally disregarding their extreme local monetary policy when visiting family or traveling, decentralized stock markets are being born, the hungriest entrepreneurs in the world have a common goal, the userbase is loud and extremely active, and so on.
This is more than money. This is the future of money, and we're the ones in the startup days.

There are several sides to any story. I wouldn't even want a one-sided party ran coin. That seems very insecure.
We all will have different opinions. You seem to think that the sides are polar opposites. Typically, the pro-government people are libertarians.
Also, pro-government will be the ones that create legit businesses... thus growing the coin you use. It's a wi-win, the ingredients you want are already baked into the cake. If it came to a point where the protocol would be re-written for governments, then the coin is dead, but again libertarians wouldn't abide by that either. Nonissue.

So there are a few things that come into play here...
1- The gaming industry is controlled by the gaming board for the most part - which is located in Nevada.
2- The gaming industry wants to grow and create value, not inhibit it, but they are historically very close-knit and require a tremendous amount of "vetting" to allow new faces to enter. It's not for anti-economic reasons, here's why:
2a- Gambling has been looked down on and discriminated for a very long time, to ensure safety of players, it needs to make decisions slowly and carefully. 
2b- Technology in gaming follow suit with 2a due to all of the legal requirements, audits, and "safe gaming" regulation. This is on the player's behalf, not casino. It is a large cost ofr casinos.
3- Online gambling quickly arose, they are high risk companies, and ultimately their stand-off and slowpoke regulation process was correct. Online gambling websites were a total PR disaster.
3a- Gaming law is protecting players, protecting the casino industry's image (so it doesn't go back to a derrogatory term), and ultimately it needs to protect gambling itself to make sure the owners are pocketing cash. A lot of these laws were created to change Vegas from a shady city with cash taken off the top, to the family friendly vacation it is today.
I'm sure I could go on... but in general the laws are and will be decided on what's best for the industry. It is not anti-competitive, it is not anti-economical, it is proactively preventative against problem.
Online poker is now legal in Nevada, if played in Nevada. That is the introductory law, a beta, and a testing ground. I am a startup guy (mod of techie, I own BTC, I am starting a BTC company (and gaming, btw), and am a libertarian BUT this specific set of regulation process has been very good and been a huge positive for gambling in general and Las Vegas.
LV companies will not pack up and go. We're still growing locally and internationally. OP's question is a banking decision question and has nothing to do with the law. From the law perspective, consider yourself  more informed and feel free to shoot me a PM or any additional replies.

He isn't saying it will take over some 1% market share. He's using it as a pricing comparable since they are very similar.
Seeing what Bitcoin's price would be at various %s of Gold (something an investor can visualize) is a very good thing to include. All that matters is the sale in business and this *will* help.
A lot of these investors also probably have gold. If you're selling BTC to this crowd and in this format, it's perfect.
I get what you're saying. But this isn't exactly what you are thinking and it does add value to the pitch. So, moot point. Bitcoin is also easier to picture totaling 1% or 5% of gold. I assume we all here are betting on it.

Do you forget the point of your original post already? Bitcoin is plenty fine now and would be fine even without those services (although damaged with SR down, but then blackmarket reloaded would take over, and so on).
You also make a claim with false evidence, backed by false data points (IE: SR is unhamed).
I don't give a shit if they try to take it down. Legally, there job is to take it down. Does that align with my personal beliefs? No, but you are (purposefully?) delusional with your claims.
Part of me also guesses SR has a kill switch that open sources a how-to and the code because DPR is a loony and would rather go down as a martyr than run.

The banks control an elected side of government, and their control mostly goes as far as a lobbying vote does on specific laws / adding their own pieces to laws.
This isn't some relation where they are in the same office. When they want change, it still takes effort. 
This is also assuming all banks and financial institutions are created equal. They aren't. You may want an all-encompassing "the banks" or "the government" and use them interchangeably as an "answer". But it's not true.
All companies dealing with purchases internationally, movement of funds, entrepreneurship within the financial space, and more... are feeling the wrath of a bulging government.

Well, the implied assumption is that you would have to "validate" it. This would be similar to a credit check. This already happens in many industries including anytime you've ever applied for a loan.
CoInvalidation proposed a system that collects all of the identity requirements of users as a central hub for bitcoin companies to implement and take care of their KYC and AML requirements. This is a far stretch from what the backlash assumed, but it's a slippery slope and no one should trust those individuals involved.

As I mentioned in other comments here... I am a BTC supporter and entrepenreur in the space.
I disregarded LTC until a week ago when simpletons around me asked what they were. They are doing research and want "whole" numbers and/or not to miss the boat. I bought my first share of LTC that day and have been quite happy since.
I also see a lot of upside in the founder working at coinbase, his brother, the market cap being enough for "why not" include it, its natural marketing as the "silver" coin is fantastic, and so on.

They are all one and in the same. The reason for alt-hate is that they obviously take away marketshare, thus value of our bitcoins. They all face the same hurdles. This is like racism, where everyone is nearly identical but disliked because they're different.
Altcoins are going to make people rich because of their ability to explosively grow and multiply your wealth. As their market caps continue to grow, at a fast pace than even bitcoin, they become large enough for bitcoin companies to include. The development and management is nearly identical, so it's a flip of a switch.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:20:04
In the most crude way to provide an example of how the real world works for startups - think of SharkTank.
The investors don't want your "what if" values of some dreamland future, they want actuals. Based on those actuals you can determine a value based on multiples / discounts. Those multiples / discounts take into account the likely upside.
So without the speculation, is bitcoin a $1bn industry with a 15x multiple right now? Is it a $5bn industry with a 3x multiple? 
Is it a $15bn industry we should value at a 60x multiple (future value of $600bn [now above gold])? ...thus the price is way undervalued?
The utility of some unknown and high risk future is really misleading to bitcoin's true **current** utility value. A government could have a huge effect on price as we saw today. There are a lot of reasons this is still extraordinarily a high risk investment.

We are also touching onto the transfer of money, commodities, and any industry you target. They are all regulated in some form and need to be recognized with proper measures taken.

No one can seem to get past the right now. This is also another reason I feel this China news is bigger than bobbleheads want to consider - the future of bitcoin in China can not compete with RMB and there will be no mainstream financial services.

You are the best. I think another take-away \(which is my mindframe... so warning: bias\) is that people need to stop looking at the price and fueling day-to-day topics.
Contribute to the infrastructure. Support companies that introduce bitcoin to large industries (very few exist right now and are struggling). And look at the long benefits more.
We talk about price and drama so much here. It is exactly what the media reports on our bitcoin and industry as well. This fuels instability. We need to discuss and help the technology of it, benefits to rich and poor alike, true bitcoin companies, and more.
I want a premier news group's article to talk about how over 50% of the world without a bank account can now have financial services, I want to preach the stability of math-based certainty, the frictionless transfers and that you can send money home to your family easier/cheaper now, the accurate and forever nature of our blockchain... hell just educate others on how *truly revolutionarythe block chain* is.

Yeah, as mentioned by the naysayers. You haven't provided enough open source code, commitment beyond your word, and so on. I will not be investing due to the questionable nature of your proposal. It has no time lines, it may or may not happen due to an ill-received financial proposal, and various other reasons.
Maybe your timing is too soon, maybe you haven't released enough of what you already do have, but for various reasons.. your strategy has not met the goals you set out.
Also, is this vest an amount that is specifically for you?  Or is it in the vesting program already set up in it. I think your failure in this will be not valuing what being successful in this would have benefited you, rather you want money upfront and the entire system is obviously built around a financial incentive to first-investors. Your greed will gain you a few thousand upfront, and lead to this thing's failure.

It is a game between the players involved. Each player would call out if the previous was a lie or not... there are similar card games and the OP has done a terrible job explaining it.
OP, no you should not do this.
1. you could have access to the lie or not lie and play the winning hand whenever the pot got large enough (which you've probably already considered and didn't mention)
2. your writing and ability to explain is so poor, I have doubts your code would be much better. Thus, the coin is likely unsafe.
3. it's a card game that involves too much trust, and trust isn't something that comes easy around here. I don't think people will care to play, and if they do, they won't trust you anyway

This is a more of a scenario for mass adoption. Same with most point of sale systems unless it's built into the thing you already carry (phone, ipad).
It's an uphill sell to a restaurant, why would they want to complicate things immensely, and bitcoin users have to 1. be in a centralized area, 2. know this place accepts bitcoin, 3. decide to spend btc on it instead of cash, 4. all have some form of app on their phones.

The nice thing about these cryptocurrencies is that even if bitcoin was to implode... which I don't think a single event can accomplish... the idea and concept are going to survive and continue along.
Our biggest problems right now has to be the volume. People aren't spending them (I rarely do, maybe $10-$20 per week). Next, the websites and businesses that accepted them no longer will since there is no benefit.

We call that "setting new precedents", but I actually never saw the original request. Is it public? Does anyone have a link?
Even a response saying the exact same thing is a response. It would imply that they also agree that there are grey areas and would be choosing whichever requirements they deem fit. 
I would imagine then that the Foundation would need to take them to court.
This court hearing could then lead to new precedents, which I don't think we'd be favorable in. I don't think it'd be favorable because it is a hard concept, technology, history, and use to understand - and let me clarify not because of lobbying or "hate". That shit against BTC is over-emphasized around this sub.

The Bitcoin Foundation has earned their stripes in my book. Way to go! 
The outcomes:
1. Good or bad, we get a precedent ruling.
2. Good or bad, we make them figure out and specify some of our own legal questions.
3. They took a hard stance and explained when/how/why Bitcoin is legal in different forms.
*Or..... the government ignores the letter and requires a MSB anyway. There's always that too.*
Regardless, awesome job! Thank you people on the bottom of that letter and those involved.

To be fair... Tommy Trash is a huge mega-DJ. Knife Party is a bit larger and did portray their album in a better way (sincere).
Basically, this sounds like someone told him to do it for a song to test it. He probably doesn't know much about BTC and promises to tell more all-stars about it. 5 BTC is actually a fair price for his level of exposure, if he follows through.

Caution though - You would only be able to use digital currencies in and out of that system. You can not facilitate the x-fer of players trade from bitcoin to USD/EUR. You will need to be very knowledgable about what constitutes becoming an exchange. That would require a money transmitter license for every state in the US your players are sitting in. If you want to do it "legit", that is.
Best of luck!

The price is speculation. When I argue BTC is currently overvalued, people back their pricing arguments with *the future value*, not present value actuals. When I argue that the future has been deeply altered by this Chinese announcement, they argue the price has nothing to do with it.
So, are we speculating or is ~$1,000 the present value backed by real transaction volume and utility?

Most of the links have negative comments, mostly about topic and writing quality. Without those fundamental necessities I don't see them "succeeding" over the long term.
By looking at the amount of topics they want to discuss (all cryptocurrencies) they will dilute the value of their articles further. Hopefully this post will be seen (which is likely) and they will adjust to less articles of higher content quality.

"Some people want to watch the world burn"
For reasons other than bitcoin's market value - control, power, etc.
This all said, since BTC is decentral and open-source, it would be foolish to think anything you did would have a finishing blow. An alt currency would take over, a new currency with new algorithm to protect the last one's failure would, a fork of BTC from the date before issue would be released, and many other different scenarios to hit the reset button and/or adapt and continue along.
If there was a catastrophic occurrence like that, I would immediately put in buy orders because I'm confident in its ability to recover or be copy/pasted with new protections in place.

I would be far more inclined to play any game that uses bitcoin. Not because I have bitcoins but because it adds a level of hardcore to the game that has been missing since Everquest. I am speaking from an *'in-game currency is tied to BTC and via player auction houses'* perspective, NOT a buy in-game store with BTC. I could care less about a game accepting BTC from their microfinance store unless I already played it.
I can't even imagine Everquest-style or vanilla-WOW-stylle world PVP with player-loot options. EQ used to let you loot the money off the players you killed plus one item. Maybe limit the total cash loot down to 1% or something, but.... that would be so unbelievable.
The economy would be super competitive and vibrant. Every player would be more engaged since they would be learning real economics tied to the fastest econ learning curve I've ever experienced (and I'm quite well educated). As more players put money into the system and joined the game, the economy itself would grow, prices would increase, and people could actually make some serious money. Bitcoins are divisible by 9 decimals - so it could work at any level.
That said, I am immediately put off by your post's title. We owe you nothing and that is a bad attitude to let off when you're conducting market research or doing marketing itself. Anyone that has released a product will let you know that - no one cares. You have to prove why people should, not the other way around.
