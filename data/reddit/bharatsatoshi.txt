The manipulation is totally with Bcash.  Vent there.

Unconfirmed transaction??? Confirmed BCH pumper!

Look at the market depth for BCH.  NOTHING but huge bids to prop it up and keep it tracing with BTC.  The market is not being allowed to function.

Yep.  I just bought that dip too!

The actions of Roger Ver and Coinbase are bad for the crypto world.  BTC can handle competition,  but getting shot in the back is not competition.  When you need Korean traders and paid pumpers to boost your coin, then that speaks volumes about your concerns for longevity and security.

If history repeats, then buy with both hands!

While you are waiting for Coinbase, I would check for another option.  They are playing fast and loose for the profits and endangering the long term viability of crypto.  Now they are planning derivitives!  Can you say 2008?

It will put and end to the nonsense we have experienced overy the last several days from the BCH propogandists.  Then we can get back to growing Bitcoin and evaluating viable alt coins.

A lot of those high fee trans. are probably junk from the BCH pump.  Miners have figured that out and may be rejecting them.  They are all code and little substance.

You can say thank you for that to Roger Ver and his cronies for your trouble.

Very close but not free.  The blockchain still needs to run underneath the LN.

I'm getting so annoyed with these Bcash pumps.  They are a distraction.  Bcash is totally unethical and I refuse to touch it or trade it.  The Bitcoin LN has more nodes than Bcash!!!  That shows just how small Bcash really is.   Hopefully this pump will die quickly and we can get back to business.
