Not to throw more shade on the situation, but is it odd to anyone else that the SkeletonKey wiz technologies promotes is identical to the ones Gox was distributing, or is that just a Japan/coincidence thing?

Having gone through those hoops myself, it hits a whole new level of slow if you answer with any word besides "No" to the "Are you a MSB?" I think that they were already operating and the banks, which backed said accounts for years, probably were waiting for regulation/clarification themselves. When the regulation hit the accounts were seized/frozen until further review. Specifically I'd say Mutum Sigillum probably should have known better but in the end this all helps regulatory needs come to the surface...which would be kind of important if you're a leading exchange housed in a different country. 
I really want to know if Karpeles is going to see any jail time since it states he was the one to say "no" on the warrant hehe

Every time a large sell occurs, the increase in volume adjusts the longer moving-averages into a more accurate position. This, in turn, fuels the next buy rally since this is all happening over such a short period of time.

Yesterday a friend of mine sold at 22.3 because he said it was weak. I argued that the MACD, Accum/Distrib., moving averages in support, stochastics, parabolic sar, etc etc all were favoring its rise due to fundamental reasons. I side more with the "Shit goin down in Yen and Euro atm" for price rises. It hasn't even truly bubbled yet considering that all the major moving averages are within 10% of current price. So if someone did choose to sell strongly the 10% dip would be seen as a "sale" to incoming market-buyers, hence another pop upward.
People also forget that this is divisible into satoshis, so the price itself is completely arbitrary. There are no tangible units like gold ingots or paper notes so why should it even be anything? Not to mention that every time it goes up everyone involved gets paid more...self-fulfilling prophecy. Haters gonna hate.

I'm in your boat but I feel that it's 100x easier to talk trash about Gox than to do math. Let's look over a few issues and LET SOMEONE PROVE US WRONG:
A ) Gox is not BitFloor. Gox is a Japanese company that adheres to all rules on their turf, was one of the early KYC/AML enforcers, and has held a ruling share for so long it hurts me to see people compare it to others at all. Not to mention that through this mess it IS STILL DOING BUSINESS at  or  by volume. 
B ) Due to lack of legal/regulatory definition, Gox is probably 2/3 guilty of failing to file as a MSB for its fiat-transfer volume. I heartily agree that the $5m should be percieved as a "deposit" with the U.S. Govmnt. I don't see them just up and shutting down now that this issue has been made known. 
C ) Yes, there is CERTAINLY A THREAT of fiat/solvency problems. However, they are a profit generating business and still hold a very decent market share. Every other exchange has not faced threats on the scale that Gox has and they're still here so I feel that this matter is more about butthurt and lack of experience with international wires. The sheer scale of what they're doing is insane vs. what people expect time-wise with regard to wires. 
D ) While the transfer cap for Euro is bad, I hear Japanese domestic transfers are top notch. If you're just going to let your 50BTC sit and then later transfer it to CoinBase/CampBX, what's the issue?
E ) Despite all this I want to see competitors and decentralization of exchanges. However, as mentioned by someone here, BitStamp is in Slovenia so we'll see if they get hit too and how well they recover. 
It's all an ongoing experiment and I'll be the first to migrate accounts if a serious substantial issue is confirmed, like in the BitFloor case. Please prove me wrong on all of this.

Point: Gox doesn't have to shut down because the US thinks so. T/F ?

After wiping a legit tear...I must wonder:
Can we also employee these homeless people with BitCoins? Having spent years with every walk of person, I know that you truly can "teach a man to fish". I am not very far from Pensacola and am curious if there isn't a hugely untapped labor market here...

Run it out of the homeless shelter on a raspberry pi where they can exchange their BTC for something useful that the shelter can order online or perhaps BitPay/etc it for them into a living situation or other. This way you can oversee them and help them begin to open bank accounts, pay taxes, etc.

"US subsidiary " wouldn't really be in Japan would it? Japan has its own banking regulations. The US did in fact rule that it "lied" by saying it was not a MSB, but then why did they have to subpoena 22 businesses in New York if the rules are so clear? They're not. 
MSB definitions do exist ( ) , do you feel that Mt. Gox is a traditional currency dealer/exchange? Do you feel that the banks that oversaw HUGE VOLUMES of such transfers for years are not-liable or should be scrutinized for lack of auditing since it's ever-so-blatant after the fact apparently uguyz?
Why would such a progressive entity do such a thing? I do not think it is so black and white. Especially followup: What now? Is $5m enough to buy off MSB laws?

As I see it, yes you are absolutely correct. Most of them are not salvageable unfortunately. However, it's that "some" that I'm interested in. Especially the &lt;25 yo's who go between orphanages/half-way houses.
They can quickly learn technology and could handle a usb-wallet. I've just started brainstorming on what would be possible for them, but simple ideas like cleaning up the trash on a beach or helping to serve food for the other homeless could easily be rewarded and supervised.
