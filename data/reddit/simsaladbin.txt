So you are responsible for f*cking up the Reddit database?

Bitcoin couldn't go much higher.

This morning I was looking up in the sky and saw those clouds floating around. Thought damn, I have to warn the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:16:34
If it makes you feel any better; Sure.
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:35:22

It's written in English so you can also assume the currency notation is. Meaning that thousand separator is a comma and decimal is a point. 
Five thousand and seventy dollars.

I disagree, this year is not a tough year.
2018 when it went from ATH to 3k that was tough for some.
But this year it went up from 3k to 13k and now back to 9k.
If you’ve been here long enough, you know how big the swings can be and that it’s risky to trade with high leverage.
Just HODL, sit back and relax. It will go up. A lot is happening and more is coming.
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:54:37
Since when is bitcoin “finance &amp; business”. It’s a nerd invention to send numbers between users on the internet. ^^/s

Haven’t you had enough of bitcoin already?
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:16:54
So far the only ones with regret are those invested in alts.
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:00:48
Can you sell bitcoin??? ELI5
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:57:47
It's clear that you don't listen or take the advice given here. So I suggest you do it and come back to us after one month with the results ;)

I don’t see him, who’re talking to?
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:28:35
I let you in on a secret; this was the last time it went under 10k!!!
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:26:45
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:42:25
I looked it up and got that info, if you say it’s wrong I remove it.

Cryptopia exchange closing has no effect on bitcoin.

You could try some clomipramine to reduce the stutter.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:56:57
Can somebody tell me what’s going on? 
I’m without internet at the moment.
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:11:53
