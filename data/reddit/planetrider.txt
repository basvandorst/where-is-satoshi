My point was never say never.  Myspace had like 90 percent of the market but didn't have any uniformity.  They gave everybody the ability to change their pages and put music on them.  Ultimately, it became a site that felt cheap and tacky and catered to teens looking to hook up.  All myspace had to do was go to a uniform UI and focus on social networking for the masses and they would probably be relavent today. Instead they chose not to and let their lions share crumble into a niche market.

How is an ipo not a pyramid by your definition?  Anyone who gets in early like a microsoft is in a pyramid? That would be a no.
A pyramid is when you fund an upper level with actual funds from new investors on a lower level.  Then repeat until you have dozens or more of levels. That's the pyramid business model.  It will fail because not enough people exist to keep it going.  Aka known as Ponsi.  It bears no resemblance to the commodity structure of bitcoin.
Plus the pyramid is always centralized because it is a business and the owner skims even more profits from the pyramid.  
You still think bitcoin is a pyramid? 
Edited to add. The social security system is closer to ponzi than btc

Seizing assets is revenue generating which opens itself up to corruption and abuse of the law at the expense of innocent people.   There are instances of just having cash in your car and being pulled over and the cash seized and never returned even though no crime was committed. They abuse the law because it's generating revenue so can continue to seize assets and so forth. This lets them purchase more staff and equipment to do the same. Huge conflict of interest in my opinion.

I agree that price goes up with added transactions and demand. It is irrelavent if I am just trying to send value from A to B in one off transaction. I don't care if its $20 or $2200 per btc if I am just sending a set amount to someone else. In that example price per btc is a non issue.   The value of btc is the vehicle, the network, to get funds sent without a central authority.
The only time price matters is if you are storing wealth in the network or if you are trying to gain from the swings.

I'm putting away around $50 a month this way. The strikes occur every week or so, so it basically dollar cost averages those btc I pick up that way.  Purchasing things with btc occasionally and buying littles bits on a go forward basis is my way of contributing to the system.
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:13:20
In the article. There is no dispute between which assets are tainted and which are untainted. The government still wants to freeze all assets in a preemptive move to secure the assets for penalty.  This is not fair for someone who needs their undisputed assets for defense. Just because it's going to court doesn't mean the person is guilty.  If the person is innocent, then this current system is broken and not meant for anything but to confiscate assets to pay for the department initiating the freeze.

Storing my money in btc sounds better than a hemmoraging savings account.
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:04:48
The issue is whether the government can freeze untainted assets in a preemptive move to secure said assets for penalty award.  If they are innocent until proven guilty then they shouldn't be able to. They are treating them as guilty and the court is just a formality until they are convicted and untainted assets taken.

I'm talking about the case in question. Where there is no dispute on tainted assets versus untainted. When and if the prosecution wins. Who gets the money that is above and beyond the tainted assets?  The state or the business that the money was stolen from? I have no problem with the damaged party getting the money but I have a problem with the government keeping the money because this just fuels the practice of inflating penalties and taking assets for general funds or however they classify it.

I don't get why they would hold your coin.   If you purchased them you should be able to freely do what you want with them.  It's disturbing to read this sort of thing.

QE is to keep stock prices up to avoid the consumers from losing confidence in the dollar.   Keeping the rich assets protected while the average workers sees their salary deluted.  It's all smoke and mirrors from the centralized control.   Normal market forces have been thrown out the window. QE is creation of a bubble and to think creating 85B a month to buy back bonds is a good thing is misplaced confidence in our overlords.

Exactly. I tried this on roulette years ago. I figured I could get small returns and get free drinks.  Sat down. Bet on black and 12 reds came up in a row destroying my bankroll.  I didn't even get a drink.  I've never tried it again.  House limits are there for a reason.

The fiat currency isn't successful because it's regulated.   It's regulated because the powers that control it wants their share of the pie.  If the zombie apocalypse occurred gold would still be valued as a trading item without regulation.   A true currency where people agree to trade with doesn't need regulation to transfer wealth successfully.

Why should the business keep it in btc?  It work be foolish to do so with a 90k transaction until the volatility is gone.   The buyer still paid in bitcoin as the medium of exchange.   That's what counts.

If bitcoin can't get foothold none of them will.   If the competition starts now it can only hurt the public perception of virtual currency.   It will emphasize that coins hold no value if you can create an infinite amount of other currencies so why bother with them at all.

Litecoin uses scrypt while btc uses sha256.  You must compare litecoins kilohashes to btc megahashes.  Same GPU rig will hash slower on litecoin than bitcoin due to scrypt memory usage.  A lot of miners just wish they would have bought coin at the time they bought their hardware.  The return has been for higher buying coin.

Its volatile because a 1000 btc buy or sell can affect prices.  That's how small the bitcoin market is.  The volume isn't there because virtually nobody as a whole uses it.  The volatility will ease with adoption.  And there is no built in erosion like the dollar so value should rise until a equalibrium is established.
I agree is is NOT stable.

Anything of value is hoarded.  Fiat is hoarded or else there wouldn't be millionaire's.   The argument that it is hoarded is not sound.  People need the necessary things to live and money will be spent regardless if it is a currency based on debt or a currency based on math.
