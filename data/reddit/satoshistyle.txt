I wonder what all this data looks like if you take Satoshi's bitcoins out of the mix.  The reason i suggest that is that i believe it to be highly improbable that he's going to 'show up' one day and cash out all his bitcoins.  It would take an extremely rare psychology for a person to sit on 1,000,000 bitcoins for 5 years as the total value of those holdings grew from perhaps hundreds of dollars to over one billion dollars not cash out a single one along the way. IMO, these coins are most likely gone forever.  So, I think without his coins in these stats, the distribution of wealth would look much more equitable.
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:20:50
If he hasn't cashed any of it in already, he's not going to.  Remember, if he wanted to, he could have done this quite anonymously using a mixing service.  
It would take a beyond-rare psychology for someone to stand pat while his fortune grew from a couple of thousand dollars, to over 1 billion dollars, without cashing out a penny's worth of profit because he is holding for a bigger gain. A bigger gain than a billion dollars?! Really? Without taking ANY profit off the table so far?  
He's most likely not interested in personal fortune at all, even for the sake of using it altruistically.  His gigantic act of altruism in life is giving the world bitcoin.  If things go well, it will have an immensely positive impact on the world and it seems unlikely that he'll destroy that by cashing out for personal gain.

@_date: 2014-06-02 23:39:16

I really enjoy James D'Angelo's Bitcoin vs. Gold lecture, i think it's excellent for learning about Bitcoin in terms of the important qualities it possess as money, and how it compares not only to gold, but to dollars:    and for the bigger political/social ramification stuff, i really like his video on transparency, found it quite mindblowing.  - an it's good regardless of the political ideologies of your audience.

I agree, and I think the media frenzy over it will drive the price up very quickly by a factor of 5x or 10x.  
Remember that price run we had to $1200 was when almost no one heard of bitcoin, and there was precious little media coverage compared to now. Now we've got the world's attention, if we run to $1200, the price is going to really explode.

Its also worth noting that the consolidation of mining power is not at all the "tragedy of the commons." That's not quite the right term for it. It's really just the centralization of power.

People who think bitcoin does not have value because it is not backed by some physical commodity, may never come around. Tell him that despite it being non-physical, *information* has value. Bitcoin is an electronic accounting ledger based on a system of consensus among it's participants.  In other words, Bitcoin is *information* and to have a bitcoin is to have a piece of scarce information on that distributed electronic ledger.
Also, the US Dollar has not been backed by gold since the 70's.  To hold a US dollar in your hand is to hold a non-scarce piece of paper/cotton with pretty green ink on it.
Sole access to my bitcoins exists on a piece of paper (okay, two pieces of paper) that no institution or organization can ever leverage or lend out, unless I voluntarily give them the ability to do so.

David Friedman's Machinery of Freedom is a great recommendation.  I feel like the legal system aspect of no-government is what trips people up the most.  I'd also recommend Robert Murphy's lecture called Market for Security ( which is along the same lines.

It would be a smart move for Neo &amp; Bee to use colored coins to do an IPO, for the purpose of raising money to set up a second branch in the ukraine.  That way we could all support bitcoin adoption in the ukraine while also participating in the first big bitcoin based IPO using colored coins.  This would be fun just for the sake of participating in an historic IPO, a cool way to support one of our new and exciting institutions, and the unique nature of the company and it's IPO could also garner some real positive media attention, which is obviously much needed after this Gox scandal.

Bitcoin is an open source network protocol. Anyone can take the source code, and change the maximum limit of bitcoins that will ever be created, but in order for that change to take effect the vast majority of bitcoin miners and wallet providers would have to choose to upgrade to this new code with the higher maximum number possible coins. That is in conflict with their own economic interests. It would be like asking farmers to voluntarily burn down half their crops instead of harvesting and selling them, every year from now onwards, and having the vast majority of them agree.

Those are 3rd parties that hold your bitcoin for you in some way, shape or form.  The point however is that i can send my money to my father/aunt/sister/brother/friend/business associate, on the other side of the world, directly from my bitcoin wallet to their bitcoin wallet, with no 3rd party involved in the transaction whatsoever.  Not only does the lack of third party make it cheaper, easier, and faster, but it means i don't have to put trust in a 3rd party in performing the transaction honorably or competently.

It is not true that there are no victims.  Customers of MtGox entered into a contract with MtGox for the custodianship of their bitcoins.  MtGox broke that contract, and owes it's customers their bitcoin.  The fact that they cannot or will not give the customers their coins back has created victims.  Your analysis is like saying that if you invite someone into your home and they murder you, there is no crime, because you voluntarily took on the risks involved in inviting them into your home.  Or even, if you buy a product off a vendor on eBay, and they do not deliver, no crime has been committed since the buyer took the calculated risk that the seller would not deliver.  NO, a contract was broken, one party is at fault, and one party is a victim.  Breach of contract is a crime.

The 2-3% fee that every talks about in the credit card industry is technically called the 'interchange fee'.  From wikipedia:  "In the US Card issuers [visa, mastercard, etc] now make over $30 billion annually from interchange fees. Interchange fees collected by Visa and MasterCard totaled $26 billion in 2004. In 2005 the number was $30.7 billion..."
So although 525 million seems like a lot, it's less than 2% of what credit cards take in in processing fees in the US alone.  The price of bitcoin could therefore grow by at least 50  times (ie, it could become a much more ubiquitous payment method) before the next halving of mining rewards, and still cost less than credit cards.
The wikipedia article:

If Satoshi has not cashed out ANY of his 1,000,000 bitcoins by now, he's not going to.  What do we really think?  He's holding out for the big score?  600 Million dollars isn't enough?  Not even enough to convince him to cash out say, 10% for a cool 60 million dollars?

Just let the free market work. In other words, people will, and have already, invented alternatives. Peercoin's proof of stake / proof of work hybrid was invented to provide more decentralization of mining power. Many coins have followed suit, even coming up with further innovations on that to tackle the problem. Even litecoin's main claim to fame was to switch the mining algorithm to something that is ASIC proof, in order to provide more decentralization of mining, and that was the first bitcoin alternative out of the gate. I think some of the bitcoin 2.0 alts will have peer2peer mining pools built in and enforced by the protocol.
The point is, we just have to see what the market comes up with. If people are highly concerned about it they are free to switch to other coins or perhaps make a push to have bitcoin's code changed, or apply social pressure to miners to join p2p pools. Its a very young industry and technology, the free market won't solve all problems instantaneously but it will solve them efficiently and morally. Give it a bit of time, see what the market comes up with, no need to turn to a governmental body to create a law to accomplish what most people want anyways.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:16:49
It seems like all those things could just be built on top of the blockchain, rather than within it.  Like a decentralized reputation network that references the blockchain, integrated into wallet software, but not part of the bitcoin protocol itself.

Absolutely correct.  The losses during the financial crises were simply socialized, meaning that instead of a few thousand people losing a lot of money each, millions of people lost a small amount of money each.  The problem with this type of solution is that it provides consumers NO INCENTIVE to seek out financially solvent institutions, and move away from financially questionable institutions!
With the recent situation with Gox, we can see from this reddit group that the community is already trying to figure out which exchanges are safest and very importantly, how exchanges can cryptographically and publicly prove their solvency. These are exactly the market forces Mr. Voorhees was talking about.

The speaker was referring to the fact that in a cryptocurrency based world, governments could not pay for war by inflating the money supply, as they have to pay for virtually every major war since the roman empire  (is, either by diluting the amount of precious metal in their coinage, or more recently, removing themselves from the gold standard during periods of war in order to print massive amounts of money). War is extremely cost ineffective compared to cooperation and trade, and without the governments ability to subtily socialize the cost of war through inflation, it's less likely, maybe impossible, to have any large scale wars.

understand that these barriers to entry you experienced when trying to get into Bitcoin exist in many markets, and are caused by government regulation for anti-money laundering and financial tracking type purposes.
the easiest and fastest way to get bitcoins, unless you live near a bitcoin ATM, is localbitcoins.com - the craigslist of buying and selling bitcoins.  you pay a bit more for the service, but it is fast and easy.

Here are some purposes for bitcoin, take them as you will:
1.  Bitcoin provides a system of money with scarcity, in stark contrast to fiat currencies which do not have the property of scarcity, strictly speaking.
2.  Bitcoin provides a system of digital 'cash' - an irreversible payment system where money transfers from one person to another, with no 3rd party necessary.
3.  Bitcoin provides an opportunity for the 3.5 billion people on the world who do not have access to traditional banking, an alternate means of banking and access to world markets, through digital currency, without the traditional barriers-to-entry that they face (such as a government recognized mailing address).
4.  Through some of the more advanced projects such as colored coins, master coin, open transactions and ethereum, bitcoin or an abstraction layer on top of it, can bring public finance to the 6 billion people in the world who do not currently have access to it.  Businesses of any size will have the opportunity to have an Initial Public Offering for almost no cost, and investors will have none of the traditional barriers-to-entry of investing.
5.  Charities and non-profits who wish to publicly demonstrate their honest operation can take advantage of Bitcoin's public ledger, the blockchain, to have all their donations and outlays completely transparent to the world.
6.  Bitcoin's blockchain can act as irrefutable, publicly visible, proof of payment.
7.  Bitcoin allows you to 'push' money to a merchant, as opposed to revealing all your financial data and trusting that they will only take what money they ought to.
That's all i could think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure there are a couple that i'm missing.

@_date: 2014-03-31 00:57:08
Right, but your argument in your original post was that "Bitcoin can never be cheaper than VISA or Mastercard even in a world where bitcoin is an accepted currency."  In a world where bitcoin is a world-wide accepted payment on the same scale that visa or master card is, it certainly could be cheaper.  The price might be $10,000 / btc, and the # of new bitcoins minted per year might be 657000 or more likely 328500, which according to your calculations would be a 'cost' of 6.6 billion or 3.3 billion, respectively, compared to visa or mastercard's likely 60 billion / year (remember, the 30 billion i quoted was within the US only).

1 confirmation is fine for basically everything except houses and cars perhaps. Lots of people find 0 confirmations fine for small purposes. Mycillium and others have/are coming up with clever ways to detect double spend attempts before the 1st confirmation, so within a couple of seconds they can assess the fraud risk on any particular transaction.

Still, as a user, why would I want to use my email service plus a third party like Dropbox, to send a 10mb file, when I could just add it as an attachment on the email instead? I'm not understanding the OP's analogy as it seems to be in fact advocating big blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:36:35
Maybe I'm missing something here, but I always assumed one of the reasons Gmail got so popular was that they allowed large email attachments. I certainly found it convenient, and it left me thinking "I wish everyone's email accounts allowed larger attachments." I can't imagine there'd be much support at this point if Google suggested they were going to go with 2mb max, do you? Isn't it still frustrating when email providers have a 2mb limit? Why would I want to use a 3rd party service like Dropbox if I didn't have to?
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:25:20
Do you think users care about email server constraints, or what emailed was 'designed for'? I'd wager most users wish there was no constraint on attachment sizes, regardless of ant inconveniences to service providers. As an IT person, I can't say I know too many people who like to be constrained when it comes to computer use, period.

Yes, based on the hope that the compromise between big blockers and segwit scaling solutions would unite the Bitcoin community once again.  That was the intent and reaction to the NYA when it was proposed.  That didn't happen, and now a significant part of the community that was content with that compromise has left for the big-blocker's immediate solution to high fees and long confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:52:26


Yes. Most people that have a lot of money in alts were originally bitcoin investors &amp; users, but left because they didn't like the direction bitcoin started going in when the current developers took over.  The bitcoin community became so contentious that it fractured, and a lot of previous, long-time Bitcoin investors got really turned off by that as well.  So, yeah, expect some animosity for these reasons.

Honestly if you are feeling as panicked as your post indicates, and assuming your post isn't sarcastic, this is simply a sign that you've invested 'more than you can afford to lose' - bitcoin is volatile, don't invest money that you can't afford to lose.

if the latency of big blocks causes theoretical double-spend risks, wouldn't increasing the block frequency avoid this issue?  1MB blocks every 1 minute wouldn't have any more latency than 1MB every 10 minutes, but would be 10x the number of transactions per second.
