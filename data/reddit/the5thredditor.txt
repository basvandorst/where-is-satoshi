Thank you for the clarification. I guess that shows how stupid I am. :)

You used the word "any". Tell me the last time you spent gold on a good or service. The only reason gold, silver, and platinum are good stores of value is because they are adopted. Bitcoin will get there. Give it time.

Can you just buy all the bitcoin you want on Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:10:05
Damn, I didn't know that Coinbase had a limit. ;)

Why are people starting to call Bitcoin(BTC) Bitcoin Core? It is the real Bitcoin by consensus.
Stop spreading the Roger Shit Ver propaganda.

I truly believe the long term value of Bitcoin is going to be as a store of value. There are many other fast transaction peer to peer currencies that can replace Bitcoin very easily.  I just think in the future this will be the gold standard of crypto.

And do you speak for everyone else other than this one youtuber? Just curious.
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:55:14
Fair enough. And I am surprised you downvoted me for asking a question.

I don't think it is a representation of how small the banks are as much as how little respect they give to bitcoin. They think that putting up a small fence can just stop it. It is too big to be stopped by something so trivial. That is how I read this.

Every single post this guy has made in the recent past is either negative or just FUD. Probably a BCash fan who is upset that it didn't get adopted after the useless Blocksize increase.

It isn't about have a retarded uneducated opinion. I personally don't share mine that much. I think the most opinionated person I have run into recently on Reddit is you. And it appears it is a rather retarded one. Learn to be more objective and don't always assume the worst. You might smile more and lower your blood pressure as well.

I agree. we need to start looking more towards this being a total Fiat replacement and not just an investment like a stock share in a company.
