No, no. It is a invite only community like many others. There are ratings for the plattform and it is like a darknet marketplace. all legit.  
you know private torrent forums, you cant get in the good ones without invites, some people use the accounts they have to make money and sell them on bitcointalk.org  
  
it is not risk free but they try to lower risk by certain techniques, sometimes they share insider information - it is all about beating the market.

I was on a preaching mission. I told them it is a money printing Maschine. That you only can win, everybody wins. One good thing cam e out of it though, now I know who my real friends are. All the people that abandoned me because of losing a couple grand were not my real friends. Haha I told them the money is on the streets, you just have to pick it up. Everybody can get richt. And many more things, yeah it was a. Very good time. My thinking was they would get rich and they coming in would raise the price further and I would profit to. Win win. Turns out only I win because I got early enough in to handle bear market

Nobody is happy with the current situation, people are unhappy. The lack in gains is real. We even have to endure loss.  
  
I guess we should do the scheudled halving RIGHT NOW. We cant wait to 2020. We need inflation to sink right now. We want gains. We want BTC to go up. Do the halving right now. We need to react.

Eh the goverment can overtake Bitcoin in a week, if they wanted to, but why bother. They could also control it like you wouldn't believe. But again why bother.  
How could that work?  
The goverment says owning bitcoin is illegal. They shut down all the exchanges that deal in USD or are based in the US. This would make bitcoin as an investment obsolet, would be just the same like investing in drugs.  
It would also destroy it as a currency. No buisness could accept or pay in bitcoin.  
  
But again, why bother? I just want to show that the goverment could easily and quickly control bitcoin, if they wanted. as of now, they are tolerating it, it is no threat.

for me the darknet is the real net, the important things are going on there, inside informations, secrets, fraud technics, you can buy drivers liences and buy trips for one third of the price. imagine going to hawaii paying only 400 bucks for a week, flight included. this sir is the darknet, unlimited possiblity, no rules. we dont live by the rules of the common people. play the system, make gains, ....

Many darknet vendors are losing money. After you order the money is in an escrow and you dont get it up until the customer finalizes the order.  
All the while BTC has fallen some 10-15%. they have to carry that loss. They arent happy. Ideally you would have a currency like USDT, that has a fixed rate.

Yeah if a business sees that cc is too expensive they add a surcharge which lot of online retailer do or stay away from cc. But the big retailer have special deals with the cc companies,  making them pay very little on each TX.  So much so,  that they prefer cc than cash.  Because mind you handling cash is quite expensive and comes with dangers which again create costs.

It doesn't need all this nonsense. It doesn't need hundreds of millions of whatever.  This is the beauty of bitcoin it is not a huge operation that only government and huge coperations can afford.  You can run it entirely on amateur graphic cards. The difficulty will adjust.  The millionaire miner are the problem not the solution. So as you see no sickend greed is necessary.

Yes they have. They block development or a simple hardfork in order to make more money. This is not what satoshi intented. He himself commented that this limit was purely random and to be heightend if needed.

 Bitcoin development is a hard fork as satoshi intended. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 07:25:56
They have no choice to cut on profits if they want or don't want to.  The thing is, if. You pay always cash you won't get anything cheaper,. Most business simple make more profit with you. Paying with cc cuts on their profit.  Most businesses treat cc and cash the same. Online business more than traditional business charge for cc payments however that's not the norm. Major players never charge for cc extra.  Business rather see you pay with cash or any form that isn't expensive to handle,  because they make more profit. You understand now  what I mean by it cuts their profits? In your Modell the business always makes the same profit because they simply add any cost simply to the consumer with no effect on turnover. This is simplistic and wishful thinking. Ever cost you adds, lowers your sales. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:14:49
My point is the greed of miners is ruining bitcoin.  What also is intended by Satoshi is that the limit is increased according to need.

This is delusion. There is much more fees connected than this to sending money with bitcoin. 
Once the bitcoin is in the wallet of the receiver, has has to pay quite some fees to get it in his hand. 
Lets say I receive some money , now I have to send it from my wallet to an exchange. The exchange charges another amount, than to transfer fait from the exchange to your bank account costs again money. 
It is a lengthy process and there are numerous times fees to be paid.

The situation with the mempool currently is to say the least suboptimal. We need segwit, because your payment can take up several days to conformation. Not everyone wants to pay fees up to 50 Cents. When I do SEPA (Bank) payments, I dont pay a single dime. Bitcoin NEEDS to be  	competitive with the fait currency, otherwise it wont stand a chance. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:28:00
Satoshi built the foundation of cryptocurrency, but he couldnt and didnt foresee all possible problems. This is where alt-coins came in. They do a better job than bitcoin in many places. They dont have the popularity yet though.  
  
Many people are invested in bitcoin here, they cant have a neutral view on it, because they are looking at their investment rather than at the currency bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:20:47
Fact of the matter is you don't have to pay these fees with bank wire or credit card TX. This is why I complain,  I hate fees.  Add a fee here,  another one here and there.  My exchange charges a fee for exchanging then I have to pay another fee to get the coins in my wallet. Then I have to pay a fee to send the btc to the vendor. I have to pay fuck ing zero fees on my euro TX,  be it cc or bank wire. Fuck this fees, there are alts who work without fees. Btc should be fee free and  instanious. No waiting  for TX to be done.

Credit Cards are the worst, the fees are too damn high as a vendor, but the users love it. What you can do as a vendor is to add fees to payment per CC. 3% is quite a lot just for a financial services. I have to pay on my end, my bank as well for my account. Fucking rip off, you end up paying thousands for financial services. However we here in europe have other systems for payment, which are also quite popular, one being SEPA. 1.5% if you combine it with Sofortüberweisung, which is instant. I like it to be free or clearly under 1%. I see there would be a real good chance for bitcoin to fill that gap. Lowest fees, like 1 Cent per Transaction AND extremly fast. At max 10 min. This can be done with segwit. The fees have to stay at 1-5 Cents and conformation within minutes. As a vendor I would make the insentive for user to use BTC in that curcumstance by adding fees to all other options. Only the problem with volitality remains. If you look at Euro to USD, you will see that there is only minimal movement. Weeks and Weeks it goes up between 2-3 Cents only. It is very stable. You can account on it. You dont have to worry about exchange rates.

That was not was I was saying. Some rise in costs, you cant but have to pass on. Like if the products you sell, rise in costs substantially you have to pass that on. But it is ludicrous to think you can pass everything on. You have to keep the cost of making business at a minimum, or either you cant compete. Other buisness are perfect at that, so you have to find a way or fail.  So no, you cant pass all costs. This is wishful thinking.

Good questions, thank you. 
If costs of a product or service rise that we sell, we pass it on, not in every case but in nearly every costs. If costs of employees rise, it has to be passed on, because it is too much to be ignored. The thing is, you have to be really careful as you are in competition. You try to keep costs at a minimum to be able to compete.

You got it all wrong. People on the darknet are clogging up the mempool with their many transactions. The mempool is very small and every TX that is not absolutly necessary should be avoided. We dont want high fees like in 2017.  
  
You should be thankful people keep their bitcoins in the wallet for years. The mempool is full. Its clogged up. Stop making TX. Keep it clean for high priority TX of investors.

Crypto has been a blessing in the skies. If it weren't for crypto currencies I would still sit in a job that I hate. Crypto got me into trading. The thing about crypto is that you have a highly volatile asset that you can trade 24/7, you have very low trading fees, that you dont have to pay any taxes for, that is tradable world wide.  
A dream for traders. I got in it slowly. Small trades and the feeling of making money out of nothing was such a rush, such a kick that I got into it. It became bigger and bigger. I traded the money that I earned, so I was more willing to take bigger risks, because my thinking was, this is free money, even if I lose it, I havent lost anything. The risks that I took paid out. The money I got I invested in my work room. I spent a lot of time and effort working at my room. I thought if I want to be successful I have to surround myself with a place that displays success, I wanted my workplace to be like a fortune 500 CEO. And I did. I spent a huge amount of money and time to make it perfect. I have a maid that cleans it pitch perfect every other day. I feel really well in my work room, I spent up to 12h a day in that room. Sitting there I feel like a boss, looking at my gains I feel like a boss. With competence, confidence comes. This is why sometimes people think I am bragging, but actually I am just very very confident about that part of my life. I know I am one of the best out there. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:48:03
BTC is not a make me rich vehicle. Risk managment is essiantal. Take gains and keep some BTC. Can always buy back in when it crashes. Bro, you have to understand when BTC collapses it could fall back in a side ralley like 2014. 3-4 years of nothing.  
My advise is very reasonable. When people dont listen to reason and call anyone who expresses caution a traitor, one is in a bubble.

Before I was always concerned about btc being in a bubble and the bubble suddenly bursting off and I would become a year long bagholder. However I realized that mass adoption phase has just started. Btc is more in the media,  people are coming in bringing fresh money. Look at how many new people sign up o to fiat btc exchanges. What we have to do is get more people into crypto. Also btc is deflationary and the btc community has strong trust in BTC. Look at that sub. I used to laugh at them,  what fanatics they were. BTC was crashing very hard and they said this is a chance,  buy, buy. Buy the dip. I thought those people are insane. I am now one of them. Btc is here to stay. Maybe I am wrong but I believe in btc. Also why I like btc more than other currencies is that it is connected very good to fiat. There is no other coin that you can trade Vs fait as easy and much as btc. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:39:58

Forget about mass adopation then, go to the trading ways of the year 2010, when bitcoin was nothing. Make bitcoin a extremly small niche? This should be the future of bitcoin.  
  
Even local bitcoin is highly regulated and it is way more risky than the classical exchanges.  
  
A future without exchanges are not a future way to go.

what I can tell you is that he (a "he" most probably) is a single person.  
they did an analysis on everything that was posted under his name. writing experts analysed his writings and made out patterns in his writing that occurred in all postings, the white paper and other documents under his name. everyone has a unique style in writing, words, phrases, the way the sentences are constructed and the like.  
  
we can say it is one person or identical twins ;). as to his gender: satoshi is very, very likely a male. first the crypto scene is very heavily male. repeated surveys came to about 95% males, the number is even higher for cryptography developers.  
  
private keys: as he developed bitcoin, even if he lost his keys, which is unlikely because he is a very intelligent and functional person, as we can see through his works. but even if, he has a backdoor in his program to restore his keys. he is the administrator of bitcoin if you so will and certainly has built some backdoors for emergency cases.

I am very, very worried. My wife said I should stop playing with the money. We have a joint account, she checks it often and asks question when there are big expenses. So I have been really smart and pulled small amounts for the past 8 weeks from the ATM. Then I put that money in another accunt she doesnt know of.   
  
Then sent the money to an exchange and bought Bitcoin. I thought I buy bitcoin - then it doubles and then I tell her, and she will be happy. It didnt turn out that way. I think I will sell now and buy myself an e-bike, and tell her I bought it from craigslist at a great deal. If she asks why it is new I will tell her a part was broken and they couldnt sell it, so I got it cheap but I can fix it. I will sent the small e-bike amount to my other account and make her believe I sent it to the craigslist seller. You got to be really smart with my wife, but I do it for her, I want her to be content and not worry.

Not trying to brag but I am one of the best crypto traders. I called two major dips, and I went ALL IN. Everything I had, I put in. I put my money where my mouth is. I risk financial bankrupcy by one of those bets but I was so sure about it, that I went all in. This dip I went in too early, I bought in at 3340 USD, still an awesome trade. I dont have any, any fiat anymore to invest in. I basically sold all my furniture, everything that I had in the house to put it crypto. it is free money. I even borrowed money from my family to put even more in crypto. My goal for this trade is 35%. After this trade I will be rebuying a fridge and a TV. Better ones. I need to sell to pay my rent. My landlord is pissed, I am late more than a week now, but I also dont want to close this trade too early, so I keep holding him off. I just need one more week, just one more week.

Many very smart people are saying Bitcoin is in a bubble and about to crash. You shouldnt be trashing anybody for saying it, it clearly mimics the movments of a bubble. I would reduce at least some portion of my holdings. Take gains now. People are VERY nervous. I am in the community and I havent seen so much nervousness yet. There is just so much uncertaintiy. I advise to reduce a portion of your position. Take gains, reduce risk. If it collapses you have at least secured some of your money. If it goes up more, you have still some stake in, and took some gains.

Forget about mass adopation then, go to the trading ways of the year 2010, when bitcoin was nothing. Make bitcoin a extremly small niche? This should be the future of bitcoin.  
  
Even local bitcoin is highly regulated and it is way more risky than the classical exchanges.  
  
A future without exchanges are not a future way to go.

Once I met someone from localbitcoins, turns out he is black and he wasnt alone, there where two other black males with him. Thugs. The deal was, I would buy 1.5 BTC. I had all the money in cash with me. Things turned sour, they tried to cheat me and steal the money. Of course I was prepared knowing such kind of deals are risky and shady people you have to deal with. I was carrying my peper spray with me. I sparyed all of them and ran as quickly as I could. What I learned from this story is never meet someone with no reviews and ask beforehand if they are blacks. I dont have anything against blacks but still I am free to choose whomever I want to make buisness with, the risk with blacks is just too high for me, there sure are some fine apples but I cant take any risk with that kind of money at stake.

I am very, very worried. My wife said I should stop playing with the money. We have a joint account, she checks it often and asks question when there are big expenses. So I have been really smart and pulled small amounts for the past 8 weeks from the ATM. Then I put that money in another accunt she doesnt know of.   
  
Then sent the money to an exchange and bought Bitcoin. I thought I buy bitcoin - then it doubles and then I tell her, and she will be happy. It didnt turn out that way. I think I will sell now and buy myself an e-bike, and tell her I bought it from craigslist at a great deal. If she asks why it is new I will tell her a part was broken and they couldnt sell it, so I got it cheap but I can fix it. I will sent the small e-bike amount to my other account and make her believe I sent it to the craigslist seller. You got to be really smart with my wife, but I do it for her, I want her to be content and not worry.

This is partially true. Gold has an inherent value. It always has been in demand in modern civilization, thousands of years ago. For its beauty.  Now there are also dozen of industrial,  medical uses.  And of course as jewelry. The big difference to btc is,  that it is physical.

Yes but 80k is a two year salary. His friend bought the coins probably at 100-200 usd,  so the loss won't actually be that big. He could leave 2-3 coins to cover the initial cost. So the friend hasn't lost anything other than  the potential of the higher price.

I calculated once what Kraken earns every day based on their volume. It was like 350k dollar per DAY. Those guys make millions and there business is growing like crazy. You have to pay fees, fees, fees at every little step. From one single trade they make like 0.5%. I see often 50 BTC trade. Thats 625 Dollars at a single trade. I am sorry but those fees are killing me. China used to have no fees and HUGE volumes. It only shows that you can keep your buisness afloat without trading fees. The fees are too damn high. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:56:15

Segwit2x has a huge support behind it, so I dont see the risk of chain split. I am not keen on the HF but it is a scaling for the future. Sathoshi thought one MB would be enough, like bill gates thought 512kb RAM is enough and nobody would ever need more.  monero does a HF every six months or so and they havent split into 10 coins. a HF doesnt mean automatic chain split. 
  
cheap tx makes mixin of tx for anonymity way cheaper and more attractive. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:59:47
If 86% are supporting why havent it activated yet. If it is only intention, but no actual signaling of Segwit2x, what are they waiting for? We have less than three weeks time for it to activate.

It is beginning. The crackdown. The European Union introduced harsh legislation against crypto currencies recently aswell. They can't take that everything is becoming decentralized and out of their reach. Once a decentralized system succeeds they can't do anything about it, there is no organisation, no nothing they could attack. Their only advantage now is the gateway to crypto currencies - FAIT. They will loose this in the foreseeable future. If trading is made decentralized even for fait they can't do anything. They are loosing control on all fronts and they are panicking. Decentralized marketplaces like open Bazar is the next thing. On all fronts cryptos are offer decentralized solutions and the government is watching live how things get out of their hand. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:34:29
Yeah maybe. Looking at it that way it sounds possible as a vision.  
I think with mass adoption there will be a higher crypto currency competition. Now there is Bitcoin, than nothing for a whole while and than ETH. BTC is now like the dollar, Oil, Gold, and most commodities are traded in Dollar. You buy most altcoins with BTC, they are traded in BTC, their price is given in BTC. We will see if BTC can keep up this dominance.  
I tell people Kodak invented the digital camera and came out the first with one. Where is kodak now? Who is leading digital photography? Nokia came out with the first mass mobiles. What significance does it have now. It wasnt able to adapt to smartphones.

Yes right. I just brought it up to show that assets, the higher the market cap, the slower they tend to grow. Look at Gold, Dollar, Euro, all move very slowly. Look at huge corporations they dont double their value in a year.   
Bitcoin triple its value in 3 months. It cant keep up that growth because the money influx to keep growing become bigger and bigger. If you threw one billion dollar at bitcoin while it was 100 USD, it would increase twenty fold. throw a billion dollar now at bitcoin now it wouldn't even double.

Bitcoin would only reach that high of a price if the US-Dollar or Euro collapses. IF that happens your concern will not be Bitcoin but not to go hungry.  
Only physical gold will be secure in a dire state. Bitcoin relies on electrical current, on internet, on devices. Good luck when a crisis like after world war I occurs to be saved by bitcoins.  
  
BTC wont have a 4000 billion marketcap. But if it gets to 10000 USD this will be huge and a reason to celebrate. Why make up nonsense numbers.  
Growth naturally slows down. Amazon Stocks grew 638 times. But the past 2 years they didnt even double. Where should the money influx come from to double such already huge marketcap.

Its different though to set a limit. I have an alarm set to inform me of any major drop, I was informed, I went running to my computer. I was there right at the bottom. Kraken failed me . I intended to jump the pullback after the big drop. missed it. This is money lost. Imagine stock exchanges working like that.  
  
And yes this happend repeatedly and has been a theme with kraken.
