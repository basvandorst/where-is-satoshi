What? i didn't say the bitcoin supply is unlimited the opposite it is limited at 21million bitcoins? Could you please explain my stupid logic because i don't understand what you are saying?

Well the most rare things in this world are actually really valuable but more abundant things like gold are valued higher because of their uses like gold. These things up on each other make it look like great money. It is like partyhats in runescape which you can own a small part off.

I don't watch Star Trek(old one) but i heard someone say  that the engines were thought of for money means that they did use money for a long time to come.
And there will only be a total of 21 million bitcoins like mentioned which will never be reached.

longest chain is the best chain. and i only care about the 21 million original bitcoins btw.

That's true  but try to get 51% of the network if bitcoin does get accepted  because you would be the richest person alive. It could happen if no one accepts bitcoin and it dies.

Like i said the total amount of gold is going to be higher bitcoin will only have 21 million coins max.
200 years ago the total amount of gold in the world was much lower as today's and gold works as an inflationary currency unlike bitcoin will.
This is why gold worked for so long and so well.

Agreed so let's not waste it in an horrible fiat currency society we live in.

Ah thank you, but the difference between gold and bitcoin is that the inflation of gold will always keep up because we keep mining gold. But we now for a fact that in 100 years there will only be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins which will never be fully mined right? Just like for example an old video game i played Runescape where you had a limited amount of rare event items. The value of this rare event items went from nothing to 5 dollars to now 6000 dollars because it is the only store of value in the game since there is no investing. This is why those rare event items are the most valuable thing in the whole game. but it is only the investing part i worry about.

Of course there is not but by mining it there is more gold supply leading to inflation if used as an currency. 
Also if heavy industry does take off in space the total supply of gold can increase even faster but that will happen when i am already dead.

One country opens it self to Bitcoin becomes the Bitcoin leader other countries miss out on the money and join the party again.

If you think of the world like a video game bitcoin is the only thing where there will never be more of than the market cap so in theory making it the most valuable thing in existent.
For an example in Runescape you have had an event which released useless party hats in the game these gave you no help or extra bonuses.
But after that event they were never more released while their were a lot of new coins created.
So after a while people catch on to the idea that it was the only way of truly holding it's value in the game and prices have skyrocketed every since.
The real value has gone from 5 in 2013 to 6000 even out preforming bitcoin itself.
But in Runescape you could not invest like in the real world and compound your wealth.
