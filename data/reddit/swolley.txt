How quickly after two confirmations until you charge back?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:41:17
Calm down, wow
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:27
Is it down? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:15
Apparently at least one hour from now until trades start happening.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:47
Holy crap

I like how every post on this thread has a different answer so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:36:40
I got mine for free from some website like five years ago lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:58:24
On that same vein, get a third nano, in case you lose the second and keep it in a tertiary location. Much easier than purchasing a second new one, waiting for shipping and stressing out about entering the correct phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:46:07
Just noticed this also after reading the thread about the new ETH on that site
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:54:59
Any reason you assume they will be $500 each?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:01:34
That's because 46 is low.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:21
Until I hear more reports of this, I'm taking this post with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:56:23
I think we're a long way from that scenario being a reality, but I think it's a possibility that, if the crypto scene gets big enough, it can leverage businesses to start accepting BTC as payment. 
We've got a lot of hurdles to cross before we get there, though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:53:31
1.5% "dip"
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:08:12
I see this joke like 20 times a day on this subreddit 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:10:21
Because you do not own your private keys if your BTC is in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:12:31
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:48:06
Nope. No one has. Ever.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:20:39
You can claim it here: 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:34:21
I remember thinking "I'll buy again when it hits 7k" and while that seems so long ago, it really was only a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:28:50
Wow. Massive risk. Hopefully it pays off for your sake.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:49
Yes, please!
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:54:20
1) Congrats! 2) Best practice to not disclose how much you purchased.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:17:18
If it goes ALL THE WAY DOWN to $23/coin, then that is when I consider it dead. I'll still hold (because why tf not at that point), but I'd have little optimism from that price.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:53:40
No, it is. Didn't you read the post?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:01:16
I'd personally rather not bust if we don't hit $240,000 in 2018 so you're alone for this one.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:19
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:53:15
It's like you're living in a pessimists' dream, lol. Stop overthinking everything. Just put it all on your hard storage device, back up the 24 words and place that in a separate location, have a second backup somewhere at perhaps a family member's house. There. You're done. A lot of the "what ifs" don't really help in this situation
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:56:12
Why 3?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:06:59
Are you sure you didn't send it to your Legacy BTC address on your Ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:52:42
The price at the time of transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:33:39
This brought up a ton of comments lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:41
Why does this guy out his goofy face in every thumbnail of his? I couldn’t watch more than the first two minutes anyway
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:07:57
How did they find your address?

This is a new, weird, elaborate troll/plan/way to beg for money from the community while at the same NOT REALLY begging for money from the community. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:50:13
reading this post and probably about to respond with contempt. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:24:10
How can you tell which trades are bots?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:53:21
What service did you use to get in contact with this person? You haven't provided enough information. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:37
Wait 2 weeks and it'll be sent back to your address.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:52:53
 If you win, buy Bitcoin. If you lose, sell Bitcoin. There you go, that'll be 0.001 BTC as payment
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:34:56
Bittrex serves me well as long as you already have BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:53:44
It’s YouTube. Chill. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:59:17
Hard to listen with this guy speaking so slowly.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:46:27
There's like 1,000 YouTube videos that can probably explain it a little better than someone on here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:54
Now it sounds like you’re just trying to get in a fight lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:22
Maybe, but it seems as though you can type it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:59
If I was a Bitcoin millionaire, I might consider doing the same thing. If I was a Bitcoin 100kousandaire, I might even consider doing the same thing. Why not? Haha that's funny
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:18:47
This is a strange Bitcoin-related video.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:55:14
I don't get it
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:51
Chinese Proverb was such a smart guy.

Yifu Guo was a student of the famous NYU University and is regarded as one of the greatest inventor in the biticoin community because of his purpose built Biticoin miner. 
His invention was so popular that within the first few months it generated revenue of over hundred dollars.

When was the last time a broker lost all your money? When was the last time an exchange lost all its customers money?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:38:42
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:04:27
Correct 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:16:41
Breathe bro lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:22
Not enough
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:21:38
Isn't it best to not store money in these online wallets? (genuine question)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:44
No, Coin Base is responsible for 27% of BTC trade volume, lol. Where did you think that translates to the US population? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:47:22
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:33:33
Really good post 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:22
Really great write up and response. Thanks. The fall you’re talking about may be happening now. 10k to 8.6k in 15ish minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:47:02
Never heard of the Dragon-Slayer thing. What's that about?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:13:00
Any reason you have two?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:10:47
I ended up finally finding my .wallet file on my old computer from around 2013 when I first became interested in BTC. I had forgotten about it entirely until a couple of nights ago when I woke up in the middle of the night. Crazy. Anyway, I didn’t have to go through with using the mnemonic phrase to access to legacy wallet which was nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:30:17
Thank you for the warning but I knew that much at least :) Update: Funds acquired! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:43:09
Coinbase and GDAX are owned by the same company, FYI. They both display the same BTC price. Coinbase is for casual traders and GDAX is a bit more for advanced traders.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:27:17
Oh okay, that makes sense. I have some money in Bitcoin and tonight was looking into the Bitcoin Ledger wallet which prompted my question. Just not sure if that's overkill or not. Do you like TREZOR?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:40:49
I'm an idiot, my bad. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:13:56
You can’t brute force Gamertags because you can’t login to a gamer tag using only the Gamertag (if that makes sense). You have to use your Microsoft ID which is associated with your GT. Additionally, it’s easy and possible to determine if an account exists or if an account is taken by just modifying the URL at xbox.com. Just FYI
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:03:59
Why? (Genuine question)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:44:39
Which website is your first link from?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:37:25
Never reveal amounts! But enough to make me very happy ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:03
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:35:50
Any more info?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:07
I think that 8.6k temporary dip was the low point for today. We'll hover back around 9,5000-10,500 before the next dip to 7,000 and below next week.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:17:08
What’s a better exchange, with this in mind?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:46:29
Yes Bitcoin is very bad. Sell them to me for half off and you can be forgiven for your sins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:26
Coinbase/GDAX seems up and fine now for me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:30:32
Alright, I'll add that to the list of items I should check out. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:08:07
Also, I have access to the e-mail that is associated with the Blockchain account. I had to approve access to attempt to log in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:04
That’s what I was thinking. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:23:51
I order hitmen with BTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:31:36
It hasn't reached 11k on GDAX which is what most people use to monitor "official" price (so I've heard).
