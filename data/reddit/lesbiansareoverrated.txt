Looks like you will get your refund, though you won't be able to use the card anymore: 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:25:06
so, everything minus fees? they probably used default fees to send it back

Where's Bitcoin and where's Coinbase... Why would they care
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:32:48
There's a bunch of MasterCard providers still: 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:20:04
OP says Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:31:37
Thanks for the response! I love me a clear corporate communication.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:05:17
Real people. I have a friend who wanted to jump on the crypto train a month ago - he's a smart guy, QA engineer, started to learn the protocol, tried how mining works, etc. - as he was 3 days into exploring he wrote to me "OMG, so you can buy just a piece of Bitcoin??" - it took him That long to get it, and was not obvious at all. After that I believe these reports.

Copy/paste the address and you should be fine. Check the fees you are paying, Coinbase might set fees that are too high. Compare to  and see if you can adjust fees in Coinbase

@_date: 2018-09-13 20:02:26
Obviously not, I'd have them remove "core" from Bitcoin's name, and place it on top - but the "recommended" thingy is the most obvious and the most arrogant one IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:55:31
it says "cryptocurrency", not Bitcoin. Sellers ask for the crypto they need. I've seen cars for Dogecoin there already:

You're right. Just wanted to check at what stage *exactly* the bitcoindotcom wallet is pushing newcomers into BCH.

Thank you. Crazy but someone just complained exactly about the same thing verbatim in my post earlier:

Perhaps. I clicked "priority fee" instead of looking for today's fees and tweaking the amount. Just went the simplest and safest way, as a user.

Or do you mean to actually send the 0.01 they ask for AND spend it elsewhere? )

To buy my ticket to a Bitcoin conference I and pay with Bitcoin (duh?) I need to:
1) write an email
2) tell you my name and country
3) wait for the address to manually pay to.
Come on guys.
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:37:12
I didn't buy the BTC I spent. 
Vice versa, I had no fiat available at the moment
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:07:07
Yeah you're right. Cards still cost money too and you have to buy them.
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:09:43
If I had a separate prepaid card without my name then I guess I'd transfer some fiat to it and pay. But I am OK with transactions not being "instant", which seems to be the only downside mentioned in comments

10% fees? Ridiculous
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:05:18
not _every time_ you buy something, but in this particular case I was OK with it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:34:54
1) You have access to your Bitcoin as long as you have your Private Key. You will need a wallet, there are many - select those that let you control private keys.
2) Buying without any verification - LBTC, Paxful, Changelly, ATMs (
3) No
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:54:41
You see it's a compromise between anonymity/regulation and price. Sellers on Paxful will offer you BTC for PayPal USD and charge you a lot more than you see on Coinmarketcap - because they have to hedge against the risk (of you opening a PayPal dispute and getting your money back while their BTC is gone). So if it's anonymous, on a platform that does not collect any info, or using a reversible payment method - then it's more expensive.
If, on the other hand you go to a regulated broker like Coinbase you'll have lower fees, BUT long verification, long deposits and withdrawals, possible outages and account locks.
It really is up to you to choose. Here's more info: 
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:15:01

@_date: 2017-11-30 22:41:15
This sucks ass. Don't use overly regulated centralized exchanges, at least that's my takeaway.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:35:42
Yes no problem in buying some to learn the ropes. Watch out and do your due diligence before every deal though.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:09:30
Yep, this seems to be the general consensus today :D 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:58:07
No matter who OP is, Bittrex is lying about their verification levels. No ID = no withdrawals of ANY size: 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:29:37
Yes but have you withdrawn it?
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:09:49

peer-to-peer marketplaces, decentralized exchanges.
Namely, Paxful, LBTC, Changelly - 
Big regulated players are the most vulnerable here. Make sure you also don't store your coin with them.

Not really - whoever was not using WaveCrest as a card issuer, survived. Some are coming up with new providers already, e.g. Bitwala is partnered with a German bank and will roll out new cards soon, etc.

Nope, they didn't:

@_date: 2018-03-05 20:02:06
I've met the name Monaco way too often but I've met zero reports of anyone actually using the card or of the cards' existence. I'll add Monaco to the table tonight, you're right it has to be there - but according to other comments it's only going to be released in the end of March
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:47:52
This post is the recap of what's been announced so far. I'll gladly publish another post once the situation changes.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:47:07
Alright, I added Monaco to the list - but most of the info is blank, I ain't installing their app and/or submitting my personal data to them, I think they're just a shady ICO. Someone with an app please comment on the limits - I'll add them to the table.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:59:23

P2P exchanges are your friend.
E.g. even though LocalBitcoins requires KYC in most contries sellers and buyers use it only to start messaging and run actual transactions off LBC to save on commission. It's not uncommon to have someone on LBC tell you write to their Telegram or sth alike. Just pay attention to their ratings and use other security measures (public place for meetings at least). Currently three best p2p exchanges to [Buy bitcoin anonymously](

Whenever there's an anonymous option, it means you can order a card without any IDs, providing just the shipment address and name on card - but those cards will have REALLY low limits, like $200 per withdrawal and, say $1000 lifetime limit. i.e. after it's had $1000 it'll just die. I have not gotten one like that, but they exist.
