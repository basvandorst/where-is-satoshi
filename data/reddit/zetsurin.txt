No, the Trezor holds your private key.  Nothing really relies on Trezors servers.  If you want you can use the restore seed on a 3rd party wallet to access your funds.  As long as you set up the correct derivation keys you have full control of all of your funds via whichever software you wish to use outside of Trezor.  The key benefit of the Trezor is that no private key is accessible from the PC you use.
This is the beauty of crypto: its all just a mathematical formula.

Me personally, I'd pay any price just to be able to get myself out of any DMV centre.

It's literally called a coin, it should be a currency.

"Well, here's your chance at almost 60% discount!"
Wow, bargain, that makes it only about 800% higher than a year ago!   Yeah, I'll wait a little longer for a better sale to buy more than I currently have.

The great news is that you can still jerk off each day.  Don't need to be retired to do that!  You also made some profit, so all good I say!

I'm long Bitcoin, so I am always happy to see it rise, but I will be first to admit it's not even a commodity.

Bought a single coin @ 40 USD years ago.  If only I actually bought more back then :(

I'll say one thing: The time to buy bitcoin is the same as the time to buy gold - when nobody is talking about it.
Given the inflationary nature of the coins, you will probably be back in the black eventually.  I admire your resolve, that's the temperament one needs when being an investor.
