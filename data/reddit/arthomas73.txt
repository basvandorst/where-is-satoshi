What if I told you, you haven't made anything until you spend it.
cash is just another store of value. it's like saying "What if I told you, you haven't made anything until you bitcoin out."

The value of a currency is it's ability to act as a proxy for the real economy.  The more people trust that it will accurately proxy the economy, the more value it has.  A reliable, accurate currency needs to slowly grow with population and increased productivity, and increases in available goods and services.
So I agree... bitcoin shouldn't be backed by anything.  I would argue any other value a currency has... the more vulnerable it is to distortions that make it less reliable as a currency... if a killer application for gold was found... it would go up in value, and get out of synch with it's function of proxying as a value store for trading goods and services. similarly if a huge gold mine was found it would devalue gold, and agin get it out of synch.  If you "back" the currency, you make it vulnerable to these types of distortions.
People trust the US government to create more money supply at a slow, reliable rate that is in line with the increased sum of goods and services available.  it's amazing really... when you consider that countries denominate their debt in their own currency.
i often wondered what will happen to bitcoin after around 2025 when it stops producing more coins....
