access. With 3/4 of Kenyan adults using MPesa, the company is able to decide what products of services people are able to utilise via the service. If they didn't utilise mpesa, people would be back to using physical cash for everything

What is needed: connection to the internet, a cell phone, and knowledge of the value of bitcoin (intrinsically) and how to get it. 
Those three things are easier said than done.

Monetas provides software to banks that enables them to offer an MPesa ( like service. All of the first implementations are planned in emerging markets, where access to financial services is low and need high. 
Like MPesa, users do not need a bank account and can send and receive money digitally. Unlike MPesa, Monetas can facilitate $0.001 transactions across mobile networks (MPesa can only be sent to a user on the same mobile network in Kenya) globally for negligible cost. 
There are no accounts, and users hold national currency in a digital wallet- just like how bitcoin is held. Although a national currency, it is issued cryptographically and held in wallets provided by licensed financial service providers (banks) who complete the AML/KYC.
Reading this will of-course discourage the hard core bitcoiners with distaste for banks, national currencies and regulation. On a positive note, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) will allow for much faster and widespread uptake of cryptofinance than that of bitcoin. This strategy allows for cryptofinance to gain widespread adoption with the AML/KYC required by every country today, while lowering barriers to financial services that have resulted in the exclusion of over 2 billion people. 
Although not the ideal for many bitcoiners, we believe it is a step in the right direction that will empower billions who don't have the luxury to access a bank and must store all of their wealth under a mattress. Once people are transacting in CBDCs, it goes without saying that settlement between cryptocurrencies will be instantaneous and fix many problems associated with buying btc with fiat today.

"It does not seem that Bitcoin has a future within this national system". Well, we hope it does have a future, but at this moment we are working on transitioning from the pilot stage to a national rollout. The possibility of buying bitcoin is a concern that will come later once everything is up and running. 
And yes, the 12 markets are all nation-states throughout Africa

"the" bitcoin blockchain

to say is more clearly, blockchain integration is coming in 2016 (coloured coins). The issuance of national currencies on the blockchain will happen, but the ability to trade btc on the platform will not yet be available  (baby steps)
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:54:20
This is the first national digital currency sanctioned by the Central Bank that will allow for the world's cheapest and most functional mobile financial service platform that allows for sub $0.01 transactions to be settled instantly, even across different mobile networks.  
So it is big for a first step.

Yes, however timelines for openness and the ability to exchange with foreign exchanges will depend on the government. Other projects we have in development are much more open and will allow for access to fx market and cross boarder transactions. 
Our plan is to open source the non-critical components to allow for 3rd parties to develop on top of them and encourage a platform for our partners to develop specific products for their target customers.

Yes, it will be on the bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:28:09
This is how Monetas believes that crypto-finance will be adopted fastest. National currencies will be around for a long time, but turning them into crypto-assets allows for instant settlements between other crypto-assets (like bitcoin or other national currencies on the blockchain) and the ability to transition form the legacy technology we have today.

A few things this article gets wrong:
1. Tunisia launched the eDinar over 10 years ago. Monetas will provide a new tech layer that will power the eDinar, but the national digital currency has actually been around for a while. 
2. "Although the firm states that its technology is similar to alternative distributed ledger technologies such as the Bitcoin blockchain, the Monetas protocol grants its authority a certain level of power which enables administrators to control the circulation of eDinar and revoke transactions." 
No, we do not claim we are similar to the bitcoin blockchain, but instead compliment it by allowing for scalable off-chain transactions. Monetas allows "administrators" (central banks) to issue currency, maintain monetary policy, adhere to AML/KYC regulations, but not control the circulation. It is not possible to revoke transactions on the Monetas platform 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:43:46
People salivate when they hear "blockchain". Monetas is not a blockchain, but instead will utilize the bitcoin blockchain as an asset layer to record ownership of the asset (coloured coins) while allowing for the trade of these crypto-assets via the off-chain Monetas solution 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:04:59
Conceptually similar, however the software has been designed from the bottom up
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:06:31
So these guys wrote this article without any input from Monetas. They got lots of stuff just plain wrong... Monetas is not developing a "advanced version of the bitcoin blockchain".

Not a private blockchain, but the ability to trade crypto-financial assets off chain. The bitcoin blockchain will be utilised as an asset layer to record ownership of the issuance, while Monetas provides for a (soon to be) decentralised off-chain transaction platform. 
Monetas software is conceptually modelled after a notary public. This "digital" notary is not a financial intermediary and never touches assets. It instead verifies the participants involved in the transaction (via public keys), and the terms of the transfer can be met (by keeping a log of the previous balance associated with sender). Although not as secure as a blockchain transaction, it is both faster and cheaper and allows for secure "off chain" transactions.

Although MPesa has done tremendous good for Kenya, there is a long way to go to make it more functional. Cryptofinance will be the tech that gets it there in the near future. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 08:24:22
Yes. This is NOT a private blockchain. Monetas is (will be when additional partners come online) a decentralised transaction layer that allows for secure off-chain transactions of crypto-assets. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 08:22:43
At the current stage, no. Things take time and we must however take steps towards the blockchain. We do plan on integrating with the blockchain in future iterations, but at this early state it not.

@_date: 2015-10-09 14:18:04
Yes, Monetas would like to solve the issue of scalability and cheap micro-payments by complementing the blockchain with a decentralised transaction layer.  
@_date: 2015-10-09 14:16:18
the eDinar has been used for remittance and online payments (from approved websites). Current plans are only for testing and to further the development of the client application to include all necessary functionality. Once this is complete, it is expected to be scaled up to migrate over existing users.

The Tunisian has something called the eDinar. A digital currency they created about 15 years ago. This will allow them to increase functionality through the ability to issue on the blockchain and trade off-chain (with Monetas). The currency they are trading in is fixed 1:1 with their national currency, and they can enter and exit their system at parity (minus exchanger fees). As the ecosystem increases in scale, they will be able to access other cypto assets within a fx marketplace.
