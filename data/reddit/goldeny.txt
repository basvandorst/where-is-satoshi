Exactly. Warren Is very conservative. When He miss the internet bubble, a lot of people said his time was over, but finally he didn't lose all respect because he was the one who laught when internet bubble popped and everybody was losing money.
So the only reason he is still alive on the market is because he is a fucking great investor, always following his strategy and thinking independant. And as investors we should all learn about his life. And the best way to "be the next Warren Buffet" is not to listen him ( because he is done since many years ) but do what Warren did his whole life : be smart, be patient, think independant, understand what you are investing in, and love what you do.
So don't say he is an idiot or whatever. He is fucking smart but all the genius people become old. Don't blame him, think by yourself, believe in what you are doing, And you will be succeed.

He has 13k followers. I think he know what was going to happen and he plan to give money anyway, but what a better way to gain popularity..

French guy here. Need to read in depth and will update. Seems good for now
Edit 1 : 
The committee on finance noted that:
1° The development of virtual currencies, among which is the bitcoin, is a long-term trend, raising important legal and economic matters, that can no longer be disregarded by public authorities.
2° Despite a number of clearly identified risks resulting from its volatility, its anonymity and its lack of legal guarantee, the bitcoin offers multiple opportunities for the future, both as a payment system and, above all, as a decentralized validation protocol.
3° Public authorities should work on a well-balanced regulatory framework, in order to prevent abuses while preserving the capacity of innovation. To that effect, the use of existing legal categories seems like the most relevant solution for now, for the definition of both virtual currencies and associated services.
4° The international comparisons realized by the French Treasury for the committee on finance show that France's choices are halfway between the strictest regulations - adopted by countries such as China, Japan or Russia - and the lightest regulations - adopted by countries such as the United States, Canada or Israel.
5° The clarification of the regulatory framework applicable to virtual currencies is to be carried out at the European level, and if possible at the international level, considering the transnational nature of virtual currencies.

I agree with your idea.
I think 40%.
And market cap is relevant.
1 you can compare with other cryptocurrencies. So if bitcoin is 4 billion, litecoin are far overevaluated for example. ( based on the service built on )
2 it's an indicator. Sure it don't mean 4 billion is invested in. But the valuation is as relevant as market cap of other company. Its part of fundamental analysis.

Ripple is not a. Cryptocurrency, it's a centralized IOU system. You can't buy ripple share, they ( the dev ) decide the price alone, so it don't mean anything.
