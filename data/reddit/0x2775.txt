That's not what he said.

I hodled through that as well, this time is different

How long in advance? This has been dragging on for 2 years already.

Because if the fees are high and everyone moves onto something else Bitcoin will be useless and lose it's value.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:19:05
So is bitcoin going to stay as it is now forever and just die? Because as it is there is never going to be any sort of consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:37:27
It's both

This is good for bitcoin

He got things right predicting the GFC but how many things has he got wrong? He expected the USD to tank in the GFC along with US stocks. The USD rallied massively and all stocks everywhere tanked, overseas more so, so his investors got the worst of everything. He got the initial gold bull market right but then it's done nothing but go backward for the last 5 years. Not to mention not having a clue about Bitcoin.

Financial crisis with currency wars

Interesting, basically the same as me price and quantity wise. I bought 500 at $8-20 (most around$10). Difference being I sold half in the run up to $250, then another 150 in the run up to the all time high. Sold most of my remaining ones this year. I have faith in crypto but not that it's going to be bitcoin that prevails. Only lost faith over the scaling and governance bullshit.
You've got balls holding that whole time without realizing any profit. How much of your net worth is tied up in bitcoin?

Saw an article on Reddit in early 2011. Was interested in gold and stuff after the gfc and instantly saw the parallels in bitcoin as sound money but with the advantages of cash. Instantly FOMO'ed and couldn't sleep until I had my hands on some!
At that time I bought them thinking they'd most likely get banned by governments, still surprised that never happened but it was a worthwhile all  or nothing gamble. You lose a few grand but unlimited upside. It's not everyday something as fundamental as money gets revolutionized.

Similar to me, on the flip side taking some profit makes holding your remaining coins much easier.

This has got to be the worse idea I have ever heard, it undermines the whole currency.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:24:18
Do you realize most of is old school bitcoiners? They have probably been in Bitcoin far longer than most people here and made far more money out of Bitcoin than you ever will.

Own both and stop worrying
@_date: 2017-04-16 10:46:05
haha, well if 150BTC is you 'just in case' you are doing a little better than me :)

Andreas is a spokesman, Vitalik actually creates stuff. There's no question who would get schooled.

This guy is an idiot, I hope people don't listen to him.
@_date: 2017-04-16 03:12:41

I'm glad I've mostly abandoned ship and don't have to worry about this bullshit anymore.

I was a gold bug starting back in 2009, when I heard about Bitcoin in 2011 I bought it because I could see the parallels with gold. Sold the gold in 2013 as I had Bitcoin and didn't need it anymore.

Maybe if you said something 5+ years ago you could pass yourself off as a visionary, not 11 hours ago.

When Peter Schiff comes around, sell.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:17:31
When it does crash those type of people lose faith in it and don't buy anyway.
