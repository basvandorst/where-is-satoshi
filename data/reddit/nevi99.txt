Actually, everybody i am talking to wants to Invest and give me their money. But I'm  worried to take it.

Yes that's true. people who are aware can do that but that's only the minority. The majority will be happy while all the transaction informations are accessible to everybody. Which could lead to massive abuse.

Sure I can, I can do that now already if I want to. But the system itself isn't anonymous. It's even more transparent than cash money.

- ok Thats nice.
- why would I buy it now when I can have it cheaper tomorrow?

No saving money doesn't help the economy.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:57:51
Yes, we will see. The reason why I am sceptical is the fear of losing even the little rest anonymity we have at the moment because all of these crypto. Nobody should know that I sometimes drive to the gas station in the night and buy chocolate :)

I understand but how does it work when I want to receive money. Somebody has to know my adress  or not?
And the divisibility doesn't help at all. Why should I buy a pizza for 0.000001 btc now if I could get a car for that same amount in 5 years?

Savas ans Sido two of the biggest names in German rap.

Yes this makes sense. Then it is probably not a currency but more something like an asset?
Edit: actually now i start to think that Bitcoin is something like a ponzi scheme. If people believe in it I will not spend it since the value is rising. If nobody believes in it I will have nothing but some bits and bytes. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:09:27
It can be. But how many people actually do it? And if all exchanges is done in crypto will it not make tracking of money flows easier? 
Once u have someone identified though one single transaction you can check all his past and future transactions. That's scary to me to be honest.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:27:38
Well that's what Bitcoin promises to be. An anonymous currency. Which it obviously isn't neither anonymous nor a currency. 
Don't get me wrong I would live to have a anonymous  currency which can't be controlled by any institution.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:45:27
That's a valid point, though. And it's much easier transferable than gold or other deflationary currency. But is that enough to justify the current hype?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:24:04
Which are those coins? They seem to be mot interesting than Bitcoin.

Not good

You shouldn't ask here for participants. The test will not be represanratiuve.

Well he would get a finacial Compensation but not in the form of interest but as a fixed reward.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:06:03
I can't believe what some are saying here. Even today we have central banks paying negative interests... 
Everything depends on supply and demand. If nobody is going to give you the interest you desire  than you have two choices. One is not to loan money or accept other ways of reward except of interest. 
There are already some banks who work like that. They lend you money and you get a fixed reward. Without compound interest.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:41:35
In a deflationary currency there would not be an interest
