trading to yourself would inflate volume, not cap.

I was asking about my banks regulations on Coinbase transactions, and the teller say to me "Bit...bit..Bit..coin? whats that?" blew my mind. there are definitely a lot of people who don't know what bitcoin is, and i would venture to guess the majority of people who *do* know what it is either don't have any or have a couple bucks in their Coinbase.
The VAST majority people don't know what an alt-coin is (except maybe ETH)

They're working to bring free internet access to those without access in Detroit.

more like, $51,000?! what do they need $70,000 for? I guess well just have to send them that $100,000 they asked for. 
This is the government were talking about after all

Buy the rumour, sell.. Your account to a shitcoin shill?

I guess its time to start using GDAX! Thanks for the heads up, i had no idea!
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:48:17
Who knew? Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:43:03
Yeah. Could always be worse though. BTMs are charging 10-20%.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:02:18
Never used GDAX. I am a bittrex guy personally. But if OP is just interested in bitcoin (for now) theres no reason they would need to use gdax at all. Unless youre saying that GDAXs fees are lower than "coinbase".
I always thought coinbase was the fiat/crypto and GDAX was purely crypto/crypto
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:01:51
Well. For me the goal is to never have to trade for fiat, but you gotta understand that liquidity is key to this market right now. The first question new investors usually have is, "how do i get my money back out?" To which i reply, "if everything goes well, youll never have to."
Edit: love the attitude btw.

In my opinion, if you are interested in bitcoin and want to invest, try cost averaging the market. Just buy whatever you can afford every month or every other month. If you stick to your schedule, you dont have to worry about buying at a good price because your costs will be averaged across the amount of time youve been paying in. 
If you want to make some money with this, i would reccomend thinking of it more like a retirement account than something you can profit from in the short term.
Coinbase charges 4% on all purchases. You can set up a debit card or bank transfer and automatic purchases if you are so inclined.
If you decide you need to sell, coinbase will wire transfer the funds into your bank account within 3-4 days. (Another 4% fee when selling).
If you plan to put money in regularly, and not take money out for as long as you can stand, that is probably your best opportunity to take any meaningful profits in your situation.  
Hope this helps. Feel free to ping or PM me if you need help figuring things out.
Edit: not BTC. But ill help ya get started.

Honestly though, you guys make some great arguments.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:55:34
Noone can say for sure if you will. Honestly, it could drop back down to $2000 for the next year before leaping up past $10,000. That said, i think most would agree that you will profit. If BTC did make it to a 1 trillion dollar market cap, each bitcoin would be valued at $47,619. A $10 investment today (.002 BTC) would be valued at ~$94. A trillion dollar market cap is lofty for BTC right now. But with coming scaling solutions and more enterprise adoption, i think very possible in the long term.

That's it guys. Might as well just rebrand as Samson Mow's Hat coin (SMH For short)

So he just has the private key hanging on his wall 4 feet wide?
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:48:59
So having a 4 foot wide private key on your wall is supposed to be *more* secure? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:23:48
Just the public key is a pretty cool idea, but then he said private key as well and I was a bit confused. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:52:15
I don't get it.
