You don't need that. Paper wallet is not a QR code, it's a list 24 (typically) words written on a piece of paper or engraved in metal or whatever. When the time comes, you simply type those words into any wallet software you may have then available. HW wallet OTOH can fail. A list of 24 words is simply less fragile in *real life* than HW wallets or QR codes. Last but not least, such word lists can be memorised while QR codes cannot.

They involve a piece of custom electronics that has not been made public. But this line of attack only makes the hardware wallet as vulnerable as the piece of paper containing the 24 words (aka. paper wallet) and this is considered very solid. Anyway, check this and watch the video on that page:

Meanwhile, the Poles told the Brits in July 1939 all the technical details about the Enigma machine (the three drum wirings, the reversing drum wiring, and the initial scrambler, etc. etc., everything, including the "bomb" machine which Alan Turing later enhanced). What was the price on *that* and why wasn't it added to the value of the gold then? If they want to count, let them count everything, no? 
Incidentally, the guy who broke the Enigma in 1932/33 in Warsaw, Marian Rejewski, happened to be in London at the time Bletchley Park was being set up yet he was never  invited to work there. It was an instance of incomprehensible stupidity and borderline criminal irresponsibility on the part of the British IMHO.

I agree. Notice how after every whale-move the price tends to continue sideways, *no matter what level has been reached*, up or down. To me this means that the market currently consists of two main actors: (1) retail, small, it just does what it does, its mood is cautiously optimistic, and (2) whales, large but VERY manipulative. What Number 2 wants is to get a lot of BTC without raising the price, in fact preferably by depressing the price as much as possible without totally ruining their future clients' trust in the thing in the first place. It also shakes the amateur weak hands and armchair traders off which again makes more BTC available for easy picking.
So it's a delicate game, that's why we've seen the following clockwork: Step 1: BTC crosses $10,000, Step 2: *immediately* there is a dump to about $9,000, Step 3: the retail gradually brings the price back up, Step 4: BTC crosses $10,000, Step 5: *immediately* there is a dump, Step n+1: rinse and repeat.
The big Wall Street movers will try to play this game as long as possible so the price will continue in this range or lower potentially even for months, despite (or more likely *because of*) all the Big Money interest/manipulation, until one of the following happens (they are not mutually exclusive): (1) PANIC sets in among the whales, when they finally notice the above tactic ends up bringing in WAY too little BTC to satisfy their clientele's needs, (2) the volume for whatever reason (foreign governments influence? changes in some laws?) increases to sufficient amount that selling a stash of BTC won't trigger a noticeable drop in price anymore.
Either way, I'd just ignore the current price shenanigans completely. TA has its place but these days the BTC chart is not it (other than for entertainment and theoretical practice).

This is what I found odd too, that Wright guy is the same way. What's up with that? But I haven't decided 100% yet. If it's a fake, it's reasonably inventive, I mean a standard faker would present himself as an American, an expert software designer, all the predictable stuff. Here somebody went an extra mile and (assuming it's all bunk) made Satoshi into a Pakistani who is not actually a big programming expert. They also made him a frequent visitor to the UK (which explains why the genesis block quotes the Times (which is something an American would never do)), etc. All in all, as far as reasonably good quality TV screenwriting goes it's not bad. On the other hand here is why I find this whole thing weird: if I were Satoshi, I would:
* probably not reveal my identity no matter what until the situation clears up completely (so another 10 years at least). Considering the stakes (nothing less than upending the world's financial system to some degree), I'd just assume there would be powers wishing me the fate of Julian Assange.
* but if I did decide to publish that web page, then:
* I'd do it through a high-powered legal firm, NOT a cheeseball PR outfit (???!),
* I'd post a short message encrypted with one of Satoshi's private keys *right at the top of that first post* - what's the DEAL with that stupid cat and mouse game? AGAIN? What does THAT accomplish exactly?
* Regardless of anything else, given the amount of money under my control, I'd have over the years be quietly and anonymously donated a slow trickle to worthy causes like cancer research.

The most important thing to understand about Bitcoin is that it's not "stored" on any particular computer or computer device. Instead, it is a so-called "private key" that gives you access to it. That private key is frequently in the form of a sequence of 24 words written down on a piece of paper. It may be worth your while to keep an eye for such a word list. It may be less than 24. Don't give those words to anyone unless you trust that person 100%. Once you have it, all you need to do is install a "Bitcoin wallet" on your computer (e.g. "Electrum"), run it, and when you open it for the first time, click on something that says: "I already have a seed" or "pass phrase" or "private key" or some such. The wallet will then prompt you to enter those 24 words. Type them in carefully. Once you are done, the wallet will tell you how many Bitcoins are available (are controlled by) that private key. Then you can ask someone trustworthy to help you do something with those coins: either keep them as an investment or cash them in.

I don't know for sure, of course, but I find his reluctance quite understandable.

Entire *countries* (e.g. Libya) were *invaded* or at least seriously threatened simply because they wanted to get off the petrodollar. So he may consider being laughed at as nothing compared to the unknown risks to his and his family's safety in the future. That's exactly what I would do if I was Satoshi anyway.

I'd say just wait several days. In general though the single *most important* thing in this business is: don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

It's a bit like the Bible says: if you have a lot (i.e., you can afford), you'll have even more, but if you have little (you cannot afford), you will lose even the little you have.
The insidious part of all that is that those decision influences are rooted in the subconscious, you are not really aware of them (while studying TA charts up the ying-yang). To you it will all seem like you have some sort of inexplicable consistent bad luck.

Bitcoins are not stored on the hard drive, they are on the network, always (think gold in a bank vault). Your wallet is merely a place to keep your private keys within an easy reach. Of course this doesn't make your situation much better.

Bitcoin does not reside in your wallet. It resides on the network. To access your Bitcoin you use secret keys. The wallet is only a handy-dandy tool to manage those secret keys so you don't have to type complicated secret gobbledygook by hand. What really counts is the 24-word seed phrase that you should safeguard (on a piece of paper, say), it allows you to recover your wallet's full functionality in case the wallet was lost or stolen or damaged.

Make sure your psychological/emotional station regarding those funds is that you can afford to lose them. Otherwise you'll be tempted to trade it, sell it when the price goes down, etc., which is a surefire way to lose it. If you do decide to buy, learn about hardware wallets.

Yes. That was the point. Marian Rejewski used an interesting abstract algebra approach using certain regularities he had noticed regarding permutations of certain cycle-like patterns and their decomposition into transpositions. He wrote a detailed mathematical paper in 1979 detailing this work. Using this "cycle theory" he was able to figure out the exact wirings of the Enigma drums. Given that, the remaining problem was figuring out the "message key" (which was the initial settings of the drums) which then resulted in getting the cleartext. Closer to the beginning of the war his (and his two collaborators') main stumbling block was simply the lack of resources. The "bomb" machine they had designed was made for them in Poland very quickly but after Germans added two more drums, they needed a machine that was 6 times as large. They also needed a new bunch of the so-called "Zygalski sheets" which vastly sped up their work (carefully prepared perforated sheets through which light was shone to detect the alignments of the holes, long story) but that again required a lot of work. This was one of the reasons they invited the French and the British in July 1939, without telling them the reason for the invitation at first, and then they told them about the theory and the method of the break. Later Bletchley Park had FAPP unlimited resources and they greatly enhanced all that work, esp. the "bomb" machine which eventually was changed from mechanical to electric, thus producing the first computer. But they never invited Rejewski to Bletchley Park which is super-bizarre not to mention astonishingly irresponsible. Bureaucratic incompetence of first magnitude.

Yes, it is stupidity but the singular single-mindedness of this stupidity strongly suggests that they have prepared precisely such a mechanism *in case they get the "word".* (Similar to newspapers preparing obituaries of famous people years in advance sometimes.) What most likely happened was this mechanism got accidentally triggered and went live (similar to newspapers, again).
So this means they are getting ready just in case. Whether this is just being overly pro-active on their part or they indeed got an unofficial word is an interesting question. I lean to the latter as being merely pro-active would IMHO tend to result in preparing for more obvious issues than Bitcoin.
So no, this was almost certainly not anything random. But not any sinister conspiracy either. Not yet.

No, the Swiss numbered bank accounts were actually not any "risk to the financial system". (Hint: nobody else except USA had this faux "problem".) The amount recovered from the Swiss banks by the US IRS using the new laws was chickenshit AND it was a one-time thing anyway. Meanwhile, the *real* problem remains to this day: big US companies like Amazon pay NO TAX. And this is not only a much bigger amount than all those pitiful Swiss chickenshit accounts but it's EVERY YEAR. Every year the IRS loses billions of dollars because of those moronic loopholes.

OK, fine. But you get the point: most of the popular presentations of Bitcoin are *way too complicated* for an average person to make any significant dent in popular acceptance. (When I say "too complicated", I don't mean to imply that everyone is stupid but that most people are for whatever reason simply *not interested* in that kind of abstract dissection.)
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:02:56
Yes, it's very good, but in my experience (talking to acquaintances, etc.) the level of detail in videos like this is FAPP way over their heads or interest level. For better or worse, this is not the way to make great numbers of people interested in Bitcoin.

Yes, and of course the USD is/was never used for crime.

Almost all explanations feature TMI for an average user. They should simply make two things clear:
* the coins do not reside in your wallet, smartphone, or computer. Instead, they permanently circulate on the network: think of gold bars sitting in a vault somewhere and all you have is claim (aka. "private key") of ownership. It is those *claims* that are stored in wallets, and wallets can be restored even if lost if you put a copy of the claim in a safe place right from the start, even on a piece of paper.
* how the system is kept safe without any central authority: it's been cooked up so that it would be more expensive for a crook to falsify records than to simply remain honest. ("More expensive" would hit him in electricity bills which would overwhelm any profits from the illegal activity.)
The rest is technical details and caveats which are mostly irrelevant to most users.

Bottom line is that if Bitcoin succeeds, it *will* rise a lot in value because the 21 million coins will have to cover at least USD $1 trillion to be feasible, no matter how you cut it. (Nothing real can be done with the current pitiful market cap.)

Yes, every single time some price drops, people's comments are as if they saw such a thing for the very first time in their lives. All that accumulated market knowledge evaporates in an instant. The psychology of markets is a most bizarre thing. IMHO the root cause of this is about 95% of the people invest more than they can afford to lose (observing that limit is probably the single *most important key to success* in this business). So the instant the price drops (for the millionth time), all reason goes out the window because of the elemental, animal-like, fear.

The whole idea of Facebook as a currency was *beyond IDIOTIC* from get-go. The sooner it's buried the better. If Zuckerberg believed for a minute this could fly, he is either incredibly naive or an idiot. Either way, the sooner he steps down, the better. He is only wasting everybody's time.

Yes, it's paradoxical but the point is that (surprisingly) there is a mathematical trick involved that makes it possible to prove that you possess the private key without actually revealing it. This was invented in the 1970s and is called "public key cryptography". It's actually not at all obvious, as I said it's a clever mathematical trick.

I have a printout I made on 26 October 1987 of *all* domain names (second level). It's about one page and a half. Interestingly, APPLE.COM is on it but no Microsoft in sight. At that time Bill Gates didn't think much of networking computers in general.

This is exactly why TA doesn't work very well with Bitcoin at this stage (i.e., several years early). The timing of the price movements up will be for the time being decided mostly by things like: (1) the dates the whales have their staff meetings and conference calls, (2) when exactly certain key people will find time to meet at a game of golf, (3) when exactly that yacht or that Honda jet will be ready to use for some function/entertainment or another, etc. etc.

I don't find it strange he does not want to provide the final proof: Bitcoin is clearly a technology which can affect the entire world financial system. Now think what happened to Julian Assange for "merely" disrupting the world war machine "slightly". Part of me can totally understand his sentiment that at least a faker is able to see his family. Another point indirectly supporting his claims is that if the real Nakamoto was someone else, that someone else would likely make some anonymous use of some of his Bitcoins, e.g. a donation to cancer research or something. It is only if Nakamoto is Wright that we have this odd situation that the relevant huge money is unable to move without potentially compromising his safety.

This sounds good on paper but is unworkable in practice because of the unpredictability of life. Taxation does work well but the key is: nobody cheats. Then the rates are low and there is no need to criminalise the evasion, and the whole thing ceases to be morally offensive. For example, in Switzerland the tax is 13.2%. And for a very different economy example: in Russia taxes used to be almost 40% until Putin in 2003 closed tax loopholes and passed the savings onto the population. The result: 14% tax rate today (someone please correct me if I'm wrong here). In the US numerous studies have been done over the last several decades and have shown a similar thing: if there were no loopholes, the US tax rate would have to be around 14% in order to generate the same money for the government. So 14% seems to be a good ballpark for honest, reasonable taxation, rather independently of the economical details.

Reminds me of Bill Gates in the early 1990s ignoring completely the Internet and networking in general. In 1987 I printed out *all* domain names in the world (1 1/2 pages) and "microsoft.com" is not on it. But Apple is, so is IBM, Lockheed, few others. Bottom line is being rich does not make you an oracle.

Bitcoins are not stored in wallets, they physically circulate in cyberspace. What wallets store is just the private keys that unlock the relevant coins so they can be spent. So ultimately the only thing that matters is the pass phrase (typically a list of 24 words written down on a piece of paper, kept in a safe place just in case) which can be used to restore a broken wallet. It doesn't have to be Ledger, any wallet that implements the pass phrase restoration (aka. seed) will work: when setting a new wallet up, click on anything that says something like "I already have a seed" and follow the prompts.

My take at ALL *mainstream* media comments/advice/forecasts regarding stock market and the like is: they are designed solely to sway the little people in the direction that would lower the price whenever Big Money wants to buy some. I could never understand, for example, how all the well-known analysts keep their jobs given their abysmal track record on predictions. But if their job is to BE WRONG for the above reason, it makes sense.

It's not difficult but intricate ("the devil is in the details" type of thing), I found Antonopoulos' book to be a very good reference: "Mastering Bitcoin" (O'Reilly, now in 2nd edition). He considers concrete transactions and traces them through the whole thing from creating the transaction to including it in the blockchain, considering what happens when information sent across the network gets out of sync between the nodes, how it's all straightened out eventually, etc. The transactions listed in that book are real, meaning you can browse the actual BTC blockchain for them.
