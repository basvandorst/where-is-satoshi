Haha I got them listed for sale for $10 each. No biters so far. 
It looks like the heat melted the plastic screws on one of them too

Ive been paying $45 a month to them via my credit card for over a year now for their fancy box. I wonder if I can switch it and pay  with bitcoin now!
Edit: Cant use Bitcoin for their subscriptions, even though they let you choose and prepay months in advanced.

Not going to purposly sell a broken unit to someone. This is absolutely rediculous that BFL pulled this after I tried demanding a refund.

I am one of the people running this fund, and I would like to clarify.
Upon seeing this now, I do see it may not have been clear and to the point enough.
This initial raise is to add about 50mhash to the setup. And we will not only be mining Litecoins. We will be mining the newest and most profitable coins, and trying to flip them around to earn the biggest profits for our shareholders.

Not that I know of. But they are interesting to play with.
I generated the pre-signed transaction with brainwallet.org
Where i entered the private key of the address that contained them, and the destination address (which was where it ended up after you imported the private key)

To increase the incentive...
If this gets front page by April 28th... the FIRST 100 accounts will have a text field appear in their account where they can enter an address. Within a few days, (Once i go through all 100), you will be receiving 0.02btc (About $3.20 around todays high) for being an early user of the site :)

Goddamnit, I just realized the tool I used put it all back to capitals. That is incorrect. Thanks for bringing that to my attention.

Well I said obfuscation in the sense that I used multiple steps of ciphers. And it was more of a puzzle.
1. Its hex, convert it to string.
2. Theres 2 parts, the first part had ROT13 applied. This is a signed transaction that needed to be broadcasted.
3. The second part was simply a Ceasar Shift by 1. After step 2 was broadcasted, the balance appears in this key.

Thats the easiest part! People have already exposed it in the comments :)
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:17:54
Didn't expect to get this many comments. 
I got all 10 for a total of 12 btc. (that's after any taxes the site included and shipping) 
Some of them I have already sold at a profit. (2 sold for 2 btc each. 1 for 1.5btc). I do understand that the Roi on them is next to non existant and I was well aware of this upon purchase. I bought them for fun, and figured why not. I currently got 2 running through my mac (an unpowered hub, surprised it worked. But the speed fluctuation is crazy due to lack or power I guess) and tomorrow I'll be setting up my pi to run them all. I have plans for experiments for mods to them to make them more efficient. If that works out I'll post up derails on that. 
I do like the share found lights. Currently blinking away in my dark room. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:28:30
Yeah, unlike my first contest, this one is actually possible. Its more about the puzzle and the steps this time, rather than the ciphers and obfuscation methods used :)
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:59:02
Uh oh
Maybe I should have taken that into account before doing this and destroying the private key...
I guess I'll make a script and let it run trying to figure it out but besides that, it may be lost
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:37:20
Am I missing something? They are looking to raise 25k...
Yet if everything they have there to offer is nought at the price set and people don't pay extra, they only raise 14.5k?
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:37:26
Haha as did I! 
Except I only bought 2 for 0.03~ each. The total dividend was 0.01585692. Awesome.

All 5 comments given...
Here is the hint.
As you already discovered, taking the binary:
**01001010 01100111 00111001 00110001 01010010 00110001 01010100 01101110 01111010 01001110 01101001 01000010 01000100 01001101 01000001 01001010 01010100 01100100 01010111 01100111 01000001 01101101 01000001 01011010 01000101 01010110 00110110 01110101 01110110 01001100 01101011 00110001 01000111 01000101 00110010 01110010 01010000 01101001 00110101 01001101 01110000 00110001 01100001 01000010 00111001 01101110 01000001 01100010 01101111 01010101 01000001**
And converting it back to a string brought:
This is **true**.
Now, it is known that private keys must start with a 5. There is only 1 5 in this text.
One user brought it to the front, but that didnt help.
Every character in this has been randomly scrambled around, I used a site like [this]( to shuffle it randomly.
Now its a race to put everything in the right order and solve it.
Now, should I also join in this race? Would that be fair? (I do not have the private key, and I would show all my work)
@_date: 2013-10-26 15:22:31

Three port hubs. I have tried everything, it seems to just max out at 18 connected no matter the configuration. Even with adding additional hubs for extra power, no luck!
Its almost as if the data collides when communicating with the Pi. As ultimately its going into the Pi over 1 usb port.

No addresses are ever really "registered" with the network. The chances that somebody else accidentally generates the same address as you is near impossible. If i remember correctly, somebody somewhere said something along the lines of: "It would take all the current power of the bitcoin network generating hashes for over a trillion years to try and land on the same as yours"
So really, you got nothing to worry about

@_date: 2013-05-05 01:13:50
Here is what you were given:
Now, taking that and converting HEX to a String you are left with this:
I said before and after the semi colon are two different things.
If you apply the ROT13 algorithm to the first portion, you get:
Pasting that into  will excute a bitcoin transaction, which pushes the bitcoins into the final resting place. The part after the semi colon is the private key. This private key applied the Ceasar shift cipher at Z (or 25). Importing that key gave you the balance.
If you figured that part out first and tried, you would be left with no balance until the first part executed.
Hope everyone had fun.
Who was the lucky person anyways?

I find it funny the project file used when compiling this was "FUNFUNPLAY". Still trying to determine what it does.
Edit: This is rediculous. It decrypts itself at runtime seemingly. Lots of care was put into this one.
Edit: The Java application that runs takes in 3 parameters. One is the file name, the second is the download path of the virus, and the third is a website. The website passed in is BTC-E.com, the real and valid domain. The domain is what is used to display on the site. Essentially this is a "simple" and script kiddyish virus loader to display the real site behind it. 
Going to run the virus in a sandbox to see if it makes any network calls.
Edit: Seems to be a keylogger.

Still looking into it. Just getting the proper run-times in place then I should be able to let you know the file path in which the virus resides.

I recently bought a rasberry pi, arduino, and over $200 of other electroncis and things I wanted. 100% with bitcoin. I'm more inclined to buy things these days If I can do it with bitcoin. My web hosting, domains and everything now are in one way or another funded by bitcoin. Its awesome.

**Since step 2 has already been solved...**
I figured I'd expose what part of it meant.
If you got it down to the text containing the semi colon, the FIRST part was a ciphered and pre-signed bitcoin transaciton.
After deciphering it, pasting it into:  pushed it to the network. So the bitcoins moved from its starting address on to another one. Now its a matter of figuring out the rest to collect!
So it was more of a dynamic puzzle. After the first part was solved, solving it actually MOVED the coins into place. Which is why both were needed.
Since the first portion is no longer needed (as it only needed to be sent through once) I figured I'd let everyone know!
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:03:57

**If you did run this, it is fairly simple to remove!**
This virus seems to connect back to a command server that takes in all details about your computer. Every few seconds it sends a keep alive.
The file is Client.exe after it is first run, located in your users Application Data\Microsoft folder.
It does not seem to transmit wallet files anywhere (as far as I can tell). 
The process is also Client.exe. So if you have that running, you probably are infected.

Well, the site template and everything is built on Twitter Bootstrap (Google It). The code is done in PHP/Javascript. I have simply learned it over the years. I started programming really young and it just caught on with me. If you are a CS major, web design should be no problem. I suck at templating and themes, but the backend and functionality code is where I excel. A nice simple way to start (which is how I did, I never read books or anything to learn this stuff) is have a project in mind. Then, for every single function and thing you need to do on this site, Google for how to do it!
Such as "How to read post data in PHP", "PHP connect to MySQL", "Javascript AJAX call","Javascript update page dynamically". Etc etc. And just piece it all together. You will learn quite a bit doing this, and it is how I got to where I am now.

Simply put, **The private key has been recovered!**
Now, I can do one of two things:
1. Run a new, EASIER and actually POSSIBLE competition, maybe spread it out over a few?
2. Evenly distribute the balance to everybody who actually took part in it. (Meaning those who commented before this post, and had something to say on topic related to what this post was about)

Yeah, I love node. Makes working with it really easy. The only database I've ever used with it is MySQL, which is annoying as hell to work with when everything is async! Using the async library with the waterfall function makes it a bit easier, but it is still a little messy

Each hub is individually powered though, so how could that be it? The hub that is getting  only has 5 on it at the moment. A different hub in the loop has 7 and its the same type of hub. So I don't think it could be that

I've never bought in. Everything I have I mined directly, or mined alt currencies on launch day and dumped them at the high pump. Ive always profited maybe 10x mining alternate currencies and selling to BTC, than mining btc directly. Ive had over 16k LTC at one point, but sold them slowly over time and currently sititng on 3.5k. I also mined 100k PPC on day 1, sold about 90k of them for $300 and I had about 80% of the volume on bitparking. Well my sell of triggered massive buys and caused a nice spike. 90k PPC as of right now is 243 BTC, or $32,076 USD (at the price of $132 each on BTC-E). You make some, you lose some. At the time I sold they were on a steady decline for months so I figured get out before its truly worth nothing. I atleast got about 10k left, so thats nice.

Reading up on that now, it should be technically possible to recover it with up to 30% damage. Seeing as theres only a little corner missing, it should be doable.
+ 0.20 EXTRA btc on top of what you drain from that private key to whoever can do it, and show how it was done :)

Oh how glad I am i didnt order the 10 block erupter blades. Initially would have been profitable this October, but now assuming the rate is consistant (Which it wont be) it will take until July 2014 and still be $80 short of breaking even.

Running this sandboxed seems to ping itself then exit. I think it knows its sandboxed. I will now run it without the sandbox for further analysis
