By paying the taxable amount on the value of the traded item?
I'm not sure, but that would make sense to me anyway

Huh. Well, my bad then. TIL. I thought they were treated as securities in this sense. Thanks for the clarification.

Thanks. I'll do some more digging tonight. Gotta get stupid cgminer working first

4.4 android devices can already do this if they have an NFC chip and the PoS terminal has the new tap-to-pay technology that's gradually (FINALLY) starting to roll out across the US. 
I'd imagine that with some effort (and possibly root privledges), you could write a smart-watch app that triggered the events on the phone to pay via google wallet with this approach. Assuming your watch has an NFC chip as well.

You can definitely insider trade a currency. It's treated just like any other security.
Having said that, bitcoin isn't currently a currency in the eyes of most governments. There's no "insider trading" because there's no laws saying it's illegal. 
There are most definitely many instances of insider trading going on. Not just with Mt.Gox, but all the time. You can see glimpses of it just looking at the price history and lining it up with big announcements.

Thank you for this, I'll be looking into it tonight. Now if I could just get cg-miner to actually ignore my 2nd video card that it's having issues with. -d &lt;working card&gt; isn't working ;_;

This is a fantastic idea and I'm sitting here trying to think about how I could integrate it into a game I'm speccing out to develop in my spare time.
The only drawback I can see is not wanting to deliver the purchased product until payment clears, since I don't have the option to use the google wallet/app store account as an in-between to front the cash. To ensure people don't just spoof their way to free in-app purchases, I'd have to hold the purchase until the transaction had at least a couple confirmations.
The reason in-app purchases work so well is because they feed off peoples impulse and need for instant gratification. Requiring a 5-15 minute buffer between purchase and item receipt to handle transaction processing would totally kill the experience, I think. 
Maybe I'd still try it out as an option, or have a stipulation that any bitcoin purchase that fails to meet &lt;x&gt; confirmations will be converted to a USD amount and charged to their google play account, but I don't know if, as a developer, I can legally do that.
Definitely something to look more into. Thanks.

The QR code is his wallet address. a lot of the bitcoin apps have QR scanners built in which will copy it to the to/from field.
