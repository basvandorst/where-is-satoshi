How do you mean the blocksize is limited to 2 user transactions? In what time? And why/how?
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:22:29
This, entirely this. Existing payment systems are extremely scam-able. 
So someone selling irreversible bitcoin for a reversible/scam-able payment method (Bank transfers are not as secure as you'd think), they will need proof your sending from you're account.
I've had people try very elaborate scams, and also had my account frozen from someone trying to scam for as little as £20.
Changing one cryptocurrency for another that wouldn't be a problem, it's entirely due to existing payments being risky for sellers to accept.

Could try through mycelium (if you have an OTG connector)
@_date: 2016-08-27 15:38:58
Localbitcoins.com is definitely an option if you find a good seller/buyer.
(I'm not from NZ so i'm not sure of the other options)
@_date: 2016-08-24 14:20:01
I mean purely from a seller point of view, existing payment methods come with a lot of risks of chargebacks, or account freezing/closure from one bad claim/payment.
If I know your account number and sort code (Which you'd have to give if wanting to accept a bank transfer), I could have your account froze within the hour, if you've had any kind of problem before it could be quite likely they'll just close your account without any chance of appeal or trying finding out what actually happened.
Edit: Not to mention being able to set up direct debits and things with that info, which aren't too hard to cancel and claim back, but the way the system is built it's actually impossible to stop it happening)
From the customer's side there are definitely good protections, but that can be built on top of cryptocurrencies anyway as an optional extra with escrow and things, with existing systems it's mandatory.
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:11:19
Paypal is easily reversible long after the transfer, and is therefore inadvisable for BTC trading. Scammer's payment of choice - so keep that in mind for any trades you may do.
@_date: 2016-08-24 14:34:02
Scanning a QR code to pay absolutely smashes apart any other payment method online, literally seconds and as fast as can possibly be, with a bonus of entering no details that are stored and then hackable.
Most places will accept the transaction instantly, unless your buying something expensive, or depositing to an exchange (or DNM).
Again consumer protections are nice, but they can be put ontop of cryptocurrencies easily. For example, i've spent a few thousand pounds at purse.io buying things from amazon, the site holds my coin and if I don't receive the item or there's a problem I know I can get it back - if everything's good I release it to the buyer.
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:51:57
I can make money magically appear at an ATM with a code you put in, using 'get cash', if you use a RBS/Natwest/Tesco ATM (but limited to £130 a day).
(Would do through localbitcoins)
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:27:07
Most wallets will display the £/$ etc. value of the BTC when your typing in to send. With Mycelium you can choose the currencies you want it to display it in, and when sending tap the top right corner and it will cycle through you typing in the amount in either BTC/£/$ while showing how much that is in the other.
Different exchanges can have a slightly different $ to BTC price and the price can move a little, so if your buying something for a set BTC price it's best to type that exact amount in. Some places (e.g. Paying in a shop through bitpay terminal/online) will automatically know the bill payment needed in when you scan the QR code.
@_date: 2016-04-07 10:32:04
All good sellers have average release time's of 0-1 minutes... It couldn't possibly be any faster (for bank transfers). Most trade's I do are &lt; 3 minutes from starting the trade, both buying and selling. So i'd disagree - it's only slow if you choose a slow seller (:
(Obviously the first trade with someone may be an extra few minutes if you need to prove you're sending from your own account)
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:58:30
Maybe they will/could only accept bitcoin after 1 purchase has been made through a regional payment method, and account region locked?

It's shitty, but hold tight, I was loosing faith but got a reply (telling me to re-submit documents). They'd opened it up so I could submit again and I got verified within 30mins, same for a friend (waiting over a month but then quickly verified).
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:57:12
This. Site is awesome for visualising!
(and at almost anytime 300 or over is a very high fee and only needs to be used if needing the transaction in the next hour or two)

Get screenshots of the trade and conversation and the part showing they have verified Number/Name/UK IP - to show to the bank. Though it's possible they may not accept any evidence.
Every bank treats an incident of fraud like this differently and it seems to be pretty random. So expect the worst (money from the fraud transaction lost &amp; account closed, however it's rare you would actually loose the money in my experience - but definitely can happen! Account closure but money retained is more likely usually, but seems it may be the other way around here, regardless you are 100% entitled to the rest of the money in the account although it can take a while unfreezing).
Ask Localbitcoins for any information on the person in a support request (and to report the user as fraudulent, if you have any message from your bank showing account froze that would help, although annoyingly banks never give anything much to tell you about it).
Sorry to hear about it, I wish these scammers all die very slow and painful deaths.
Every trade where you accept bank transfers you should get your own verification from them with ID and note showing that they know they are buying bitcoin, it will avoid most of these scam attempts (although I know it doesn't help the current situation).
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:18:20
Yes, just as a lot of new people are flooding in from various news articles, we take away the first/easiest line of defence for them to spot scams/ incorrect info.
I can see it could help for some unpopular views in technical discussions. But there's definitely a price to pay by choosing max vote-hiding in an attempt to support them.
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:16:11
I think because it allows institutions an easy way of getting exposure to bitcoin, without actually having to think about holding and securing any - or the regulatory/policy issues of that - It's going through more regular channels. Also people can invest through 401k plans and things.
Initial holders had to hold shares for atleast a year, so I think that stops arbitrage.
(I know very little about any of those but I believe that is generally why, I imagine it may be less overvalued when Winklevoss ETF comes out as another channel for such institutions and individuals).
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:24:04
No, it is hard to believe, but with just the account and sort code you can set up as many direct debits as you want to companies. (It's up to the company to put in any extra checks, but enough don't).
I've had a lot of direct debits appear on my account for random insurance companies. Worst thing is the banks say there is no way they can stop it, I've repeatedly asked but can't stop an account from having direct debits set up.
Though because of the obvious flaws, it's easy to recall them, even a long time after. (UK DD, maybe different systems in the US).

Segwit gives you different segwit addresses, to get your coin into segwit you'd click that first and copy an address to receive to - then go back out and into legacy and send to your segwit address.

No linking needed :) literally can take 5-10mins to complete the trade, just as easy as sending money to a friend :) However, if your a new account, and especially if your wanting to buy a lot on your first buys, sellers will probably want some kind of ID just to check your name is the same as the bank account you use (some people try and use stolen accounts). ID can usually be a picture of your bank card with the number covered just to check your name, or picture of driving licence or something. Once you've had a few trades and feedback then you may be ok without

All existing payment systems are generally flawed, meaning the seller takes a risk every trade. Even having ID's is no guarantee. And banks will close accounts after 1-2 problems, even if you've done everything as perfectly as possible, and banked with them for years.
So it can be ok, but be fully prepared you will likely experience scam attempts and bank closures. (Not applicable for cash trades, although that is far more effort and can have other things to consider like counterfeit's/dealing with a lot of cash).

Lending to people wanting to short BTC - there'd be short periods where many peeps may be desperate to short and would pay over this rate for a few days or weeks.

It's free? I need to look into how OpenTimestamps work again, how be it free, don't you have to do a bitcoin transaction - even if you group transactions?
If you group hashes then you don't have 'granularity' to know which thing changed. Unless it's run's on a whole other system, which would still need payment.

That doesn't sound too great to be honest, as fee's rise granularity and accuracy of timestamp gets worse? So fees rise 10x you get 10x less anchors?
I could see how some use cases may not care for exact accuracy of timestamp or high granularity (knowing that if it doesn't match then which exact document is different or missing, not just that something in a whole database is different but no clue what it is), but for some it definitely would matter.
E.g. if you want to prove authenticity of all documents in mortgage cases, using Factom you can know exactly the costs per document now and in a month or year and can plan. If something is wrong and you've factomized every document individually (which is very cheap) then you'd know exactly what the problem is and still prove all the rest of the documents in the case, and rest if the documents in your system are correct.
Using opentimestamps you would just know something was wrong in your database?
I should just research myself again, so sorry if my assertations on opentimestamps are not correct

Depends what country you're in. In the UK you'd give Name, Sort code &amp; Account number (and any reference you want them to put). Sort code &amp; account number can be used to set up Direct Debits pretty easily - shoddy bank system - but they're also pretty easy to cancel and long after they are set up because of that.
The main problem is risk of reversal, or mainly 'man in the middle' attacks. Choose someone with many trades over time and you should be fine. Large amount or low trades then definitely get some ID with note so you're confident they are sending from their own account, and have some proof they knew they were buying bitcoin.

Sending with mycellium with 'normal' fee is 9p at the moment. Not sure what you're using to send, but unless you need 99.999999% guarantee of inclusion in the next block rather than 95%-99%, you would be fine putting a 10x lower fee.
Obviously 1p fee's were far better, and makes a real difference for adoption in poorer countries, but it's nowhere near £1 for normal use yet.

Yes, small trade your most likely fine, big trade could be at large risk of reversal.
In future get a picture of ID with a note to be sure the person sending the money is the same person you're speaking to in the trade, and to have proof they know they're buying bitcoin.

Sellers are at risk of man in the middle scams, so need proof the person is sending from their own account. It's not ideal, but absolutely necessary protection when trading an irreversible currency for a fiat payment method that is less so.

Localbitcoins, but use a normal payment method (Bank transfer or Cash)
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:39:04
Your account will likely be closed, you will likely get the balance of your account back, but it can take a month or two and many times of going in to show ID and ask before you hear a decision/ any info.
If it was for a specific transaction someone tried reversing, then you'll have to get the evidence (ID's and things that you need to be getting from people anyway - if your not, then begin doing so or stop trading forever as you'll always be hit by scams with nothing to protect yourself)
Banks all react differently, and for each situation, so noone will be able to say for sure - depends if you were just flagged or if it was a 'man in the middle' attack - again, if you don't know what that is, look it up and protect yourself or stop trading forever.
Just ask for specifics of why, and keep chasing it, expecting the worst (taking a while to hear and account closed) but hope for the best.
Good luck.

If they have many trades/ a long time verified with that name you will most likely be fine. The problem is 'man in the middle' attacks, which the specific note &amp; ID helps to mitigate.

I love everything about Revolut (Apart from no Fasterpayments, that means I can't use it as my only/main bank still, but that's a UK bank issue of not opening up).
This feels a little anti-trust/ old bank style thinking though, stop customers going elsewhere because they might be offering the service? surely they can just do it better/easier anyway and not worry?
(Guessing it might be trying to appease their banking partner/overlord in someway?)
I'm supposedly signed up the the Revolut BTC Beta test, but been waiting 2 months with no word now.
Already recommending to friends, but if they add seemless/cheap cryptocurrency exchanging/card spending, and somehow managed the miracle of true faster payments then I would abandon everything for them imediately and spread their gospel.

Yes, can be very annoying for sellers as it messes them around (and if multiple people do the same then they have coin's locked up for a while). If you do it regularly you may pick up some negative ratings and others will be less likely to trade with you (can also set trades so people under certain % can't see them).
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:42:07






@_date: 2017-11-01 13:33:59
No real penalty (other than possible bad rating), just morally questionable.
I guess you mean Cash trade rather than online, as payment window is usually 90min for that. Tbh I thought cash trades generally have a bit of floating price, but haven't dealt with them so can't say for sure.

I think also fee estimations and customisable fee's in wallets are a lot better now. I think before an attacker could fill up blocks to create higher fee's, then it would become a self fuelling fire of high fee's for a while as people keep putting 10-100x the fee needed even when there's not that many transactions anymore, now it should return to normal fee's a lot quicker.

@_date: 2019-02-07 11:59:42
Yes, I think fee estimation &amp; also more customisation in wallets is pretty huge. Mycelium only had 3 options I think, and the lowest was sometimes insanely overshot.
I think before high fee's led to a self fueling fire of high fee's for ages because of that, now things should return to normal far quicker after big flurry's - be it attacks or normal cycles.

No, just no. I really suggest you take scamming seriously, some might be loss of money, but others will be accounts frozen and closed, chance of being put on blacklists and visits from law enforcement. Scams aren't necessarily just someone reversing, the problem is man in the middle scams.
It seems fine for a bit, but seriously, if you never ID you will loose a lot of money and accounts and it won't be worth it, plus you have very little defense when something does go wrong.
(Source: 6000+ trades)
@_date: 2016-09-18 18:50:36
An ID with note is required by most sellers on LBC, any seller not asking for ID when accepting bank transfers will do when they are hit by a scam and learn the hard way.
If you choose a good &amp; trusted seller you'll be fine. Localbitcoins watermarks the picture when you upload it - overlaying the site and specific trade number - so it can't be re-used.

Fiat spend is estimated, and Tether being un-backed is speculation. They may have all, 50% or nothing. But you don't know.
It's big, and would be a blow (mainly through panic / reputation), but it's not as big as Gox, and a very different eco-system and situation in general.

@_date: 2018-02-28 09:25:31
Unfair to be downvoted for asking tbh.
Some kind of cost to sending is needed to prevent spam - Also eventually fees will become a larger proportion of the money paid to miners for securing the network, as the block reward keeps halving.
Networks with free(ish) transactions generally have no one actually using them, no solution to spam attacks when they are used or subsidise with a higher coin inflation rate etc.

Though unlike IRL, The entire customer base and potential future customers are all connected via visible feedback and ratings. So as soon as a seller tries to scam, people would know and not use them. (Obviously customer bases are always connected to a degree, but far more removed than in an online market)
The amount of options is vastly increased, multiplying the effect of more minor bad deals (e.g. IRL a guy may be giving bad/variable quality but being the only dealer in town people still use)
The payment would also probably be in some form of escrow, so if the seller sends a bad product they'd be unlikely to receive any money
Obviously it won't be perfect, but it seems like the chances of people getting a bad product would be reduced overall
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:10:06
Best option depends on which country your in. A good seller on localbitcoins should be able to sort it quickly
@_date: 2015-09-12 01:04:16
If a merchant has customers pay through bitcoin, it encourages other merchants to accept it, increasing the viability of business to business bitcoin purchases. 
For businesses and consumers, the more options there are (especially covering usual purchases) the more incentive there is to hold some/more.
Spending at a place where they convert 100% to fiat is like selling on an exchange, but encourages an eco-system which could lead to higher demand.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:38:12
Paypal payment are far too reversible, so it's hard to find people willing to trade a reversible payment for an irreversible one

Localbitcoins doesn't work like that, no experience, but I doubt coinbase works like that.

Very interesting, does anyone know any merchants that use NorthPayments currently?
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:38:38
It's hard to ever get clear information from banks about this, but yes. The huge risk to people selling bitcoin in the reversible nature of online fiat (be it bank transfers or paypal - Never accept paypal!!)
Banks handle it in different ways and often can cancel the reversal pretty quick if you show full evidence of the transaction. 
However, they can also just give up as soon as they hear bitcoin and close your account, but I think they're generally becoming better. So get all the evidence you have and give it em' to prove you upheld your end. (did you get ID to prove they initiated the transfer?)
In future ID's from people, preferably with a note proving they have taken the photo. and mainly - don't trade too larger amounts unless you trust and have traded before!
Good luck! I hate these fkers with an absolute passion. Don't believe it was necessarily a hacked account, I think it's more likely a man in the middle attack or someone just trying it on.

Used for many years and many trades (UK - Bank Transfers).
'Advertiser' pays 1% fee, that is the only fee (although sellers all set their own prices and can be around 1-10% over the 'exchange' price).
Buying - Choose a good seller and it should be super fast and easy
Selling - Be careful, well rated buyers and you will be fine, but if you're putting up the advertisement and accepting bank transfers then make sure you get a picture of ID and be careful!!
Buying is very easy and safe, but selling to newbie's can be risky if you don't do appropriate checks.
Never ever use paypal.

edit: After inspection:
- Bitcoin already available and listed twice for deposit methods (Min: £10 Max: £10,000)

Mining generally requires cheap electricity + enough money to get the latest miner + ability to set it up, most people will be better off just buying bitcoin instead - Unless you generally just want to support and help decentralise the network.
Buying/trading depends massively on where you are and what method you'd like to buy with.
Localbitcoins.com is generally easy, quick and global, if you find a good seller they will usually help you with advice if you need aswel.
Depending on where you are, Circle/Coinbase are options, also exchanges like Kraken/Bitfinex/Bitstamp - but there can be lengthy account authentication processes + fees and delays depending on where you are.
Welcome to the world of bitcoin :)

Localbitcoins traders are the only people I have any trust in anymore (As long as they've done a decent amount of trades). 
Never had a problem loaning to big LBC traders, but i've had big losses on loans in USD/EUR/INR. Used to spend a long time assessing and diversifying, but would still be waay down overall if it wasn't for going in big with the few LBC sellers and 1 big miner.

As an isolated point no, but the torrent market was only mentioned here as an example of something thriving despite many attempts at shutting it down.
It's very interesting that it's shrinking as an overall, but I think it's still pretty huge? and only really made smaller by the rise of decent alternatives.
Bringing back to bitcoin, that could mean a higher risk of being superseded by better alternatives rather than any attempts to shut it down.

I double checked, William Hill definately doesn't accept bitcoin right now.
There was a [Forbes article in 2013]( which claimed:
- WinPoker "...will now begin accepting bitcoin as a deposit and withdrawal method to their WinPoker accounts which are on the iPoker network.
Consisting of over 30 different brands, including large European bookmakers like Paddy Power, Bet365, Betfair and William Hill."
They are all pretty huge, I don't know if they ever actually began accepting bitcoin, or if they did but only through neteller and then stopped that?

But with MMM being talked about in media a lot suddenly, I wouldn't be surprised if the traffic doubled from that alone. But most of those people would be visiting just out of interest to see how big of a ponzi it is.
Also by visitors, it seems to be a lot bigger in India &amp; South Africa than in China.
There's no doubting there are some users from the youtube channel... but also it only has 5000 subscribers and a handful of people uploading a day... very very far from something with millions of users, specially if they are all being instructed/promised big rewards for posting.
So I don't doubt there'd be some effect from MMM, but if they're just using it as a transfer medium and selling again straight away, the effect would be neutralised anyway.

For something relatively new/ not known or fully understood/ with barriers (both real &amp; perceived) to purchasing, I don't think that statement is correct.
If I think there's a good chance 1000x or more people will join and the price will sky rocket - I still have very real limitations on what I can invest, therefore the price definitely will not reflect the actual event of &gt;1000x more people wanting to buy.

:( Still the main reaction seems to be "just look up how much bitcoin companies have stolen from people". 
A massive aspect of human psychology is that first impressions of something create a heavy base for which all future information is assessed. 
This sadly means that far more positive news has to be heard before the majority will change their view of bitcoin to positive. Luckily the system bitcoin competes with is just about as shitty and thieving as they come, and the positive aspects of bitcoin should continue to grow 'exponentially' (or 'by a lot' to be more technically correct).

What a government wishes to allow has varying degrees of effect depending on the country in question. But no governments wishes are ever absolute. The price would be hit, but I can't see every single government in the world banning it, and if that isn't the case then bitcoin certainly wouldn't be 'finished'.
I believe it would be vastly reduced in value for a while, but also worth a lot more than 0.40c. Who know's at the end of the day, but it's the surety of the 'bitcoin would be finished' line that made me laugh :)

Localbitcoins.com has an escrow system for buying/selling bitcoin.
Purse.io has similar for buying things on amazon with bitcoin and releasing when you receive the item.
Then there are general escrow services independent of specific sites. (that's probably what you're asking about, but I haven't used any general escrow services myself).

For most people, Localbitcoins provides an easy place to buy (or sell) bitcoin, and through a variety of methods. 
People will generally be happy to pay a bit above market to get the coin quickly (and also not having to go through the lengthy verification of exchanges, or sometimes fees)
Though people also sell a bit below market if they need the fiat quickly, or similarly not being able or wanting to wait for verification and transfer to/from an exchange.
So if you didn't need/want to sell quickly, or for a certain method, you could likely sell for more. But if you put up an ad instead of instant selling to someone else's ad, you have to pay the 1% advertiser fee + people will likely choose a high rated seller first unless you offer a bit lower price.
There's a few things like for the UK, I think the max available needs to be atleast £100 for it to be on the front page (otherwise it's still findable, just through search, or 'more' options.
Also be aware with selling, that pretty much all existing online payment systems are flawed, meaning sellers trading in an irreversible asset/currency like bitcoin are vulnerable.

Allowing chargebacks would be a very different system (and one that, like the current systems, gives a massive amount of help to scammers).

There'd have to be check's to not end up creating a 'steal-on-demand' market, like having to provide reciepts/proof of purchase. Also possibly requiring items to be bought in cash so return right's aren't affected and things.
There are already companies offering food delivery for stores that don't deliver, so I imagine this would share similarities with that, except for all things :)

I see many varied reactions from extreme interest to the "bitcoin - Ha!" response. 
I think a main thing is that if you know absolutely nothing about bitcoin, you'd question how it's just 'invented', and then only hearing Gox repeated in the media leads many people to dismiss it as 'dodgy' or a scam

[a numerical mess](
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:50:44
[You can see the current distribution of Factom nodes on Factoshi.io - currently 137]( but I believe that will grow quite a lot over the next year or two. Factom is early in it's decentralisation phase still, but is already more decentralised than most of the top projects. It has one of the most decentralised and mainly *completely transparent* governance systems. [You can see all the discussions between the node operators and take part/ ask any questions in the Discord]( [and on Factomize]( - Node teams are not afraid to hold each other to account (as users do to).
The 26 teams all include at least 3 people, some like Factom inc. have over 40. There are also many companies working on top of factom that are not ANO's (Authority Node Operators) such as [Linxens]( Dutch company [Sphereon]( and Chinese company [Wancloud]( - Who will try to become an ANO too in the next on-boarding round (in about 2 months I think).
Factom isn't mined, it is paid to ANO's for running multiple high capacity servers. ANO's are expected to have 24/7 response to any issues, take part in governance and generally further the protocol. They all defer a certain amount of their FCT per month to the grant pool for paying others for development. If an ANO is mainly just a high quality server team than they generally defer 70% to the grant pool. This means around half of the new Factom created is going directly to pay for it's own development and improvement, and a lot of the other the teams are developing and improving out of their own pocket too. As Factom has to be burned (destroyed for ever) by anyone using the network, this ofsets inflation and also should eventually provide an equilibrium, where price grows as useage grows. (As price grows each Factom can be exchanged for more entry credits - always kept at $0.001 - if there is excessive usage and FCT burned than the price will likely rise to accommodate the new useage.
If you keep a mysql yourself and want to keep anchoring in to bitcoin for every change that is going to cost you a lot of money, specially if everyone else is wanting to do that too, and specially if transaction costs of the main net rise (which a lot expect them too, by many times, luckily Lightning/Factom and 2nd layer solutions should make it more usable then ever at that time while keeping insane security). Using Factom will be 1000's of time's cheaper.
Others could copy the Factom network, but they would have to also be as perfectly transparent, have a way to pay for the high capacity and quality nodes and network teams to prove their trust. But it is possible :) The world will get a trust mechanism either way, and it will sorely need it. The amount of data, importance of it and ability to fake that data will all continue increasing at pretty crazy rates going forward! But if it's to secure billions of documents it needs to be crazy scalable and cheap, so that's why you need a system ontop of BTC to do that.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:19:25
Using localbitcoins, you would usually have coins in under 2hours (within 5mins if you use a good seller and your bank transfers that quick). 
However scammers have really made it hard for legit new people, most sellers have been hit at some point, often leading to major hassles with banks over months and accounts closed. So the risk for them can be quite high with new buyers. A picture of some kind of ID just to show your name and if your only buying a small amount you should be fine, once you've built up a few trades people will be more open, just remember  that to begin with you appear indistinguishable to the guy that just got their account frozen over $30

@_date: 2017-06-16 13:16:29
As Manticlops said below, it's highly reversible, even a while after the trade. 
But so are bank transfers to a certain extent too, that's why it's best to go with someone with many trades and 100% rating. If you sell high amounts, or to anyone that's a vaguely new trader, then you should ask for ID (with note to prove they know they're buying bitcoin).
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:45:33
Hashing straight into bitcoin is prohibitively expensive, specially for someone/business wanting to secure 1 document or wanting to prove each page of each document, or each change. To combat that Factom is it's own blockchain layer that can anchor into bitcoin (able to anchor into multiple, or any future chain, obviously bitcoin is the most secure right now and I believe still will be long in the future. But if that changes Factom can easily switch or anchor to multiple) 
It has 26 teams running servers currently, moving to 65+ overall. Instead of the token paying *only* for security like bitcoin, Factom (while fairly decentralised and secure by itself) can buy it's security cheap from bitcoin and others. FCT needs to exist to pay the high functioning nodes, but it means some can be used for development too (nodes defer a certain percentage - average around 50% at the moment, to a grant pool, where anyone can apply for a grant to improve the protocol). There is an expectation and will be high pressure and competition for nodes to be furthering the protocol or they will be voted out.
FCT is burned to create entry credits, needed to write information to the Factom chain. This two token system isolates use of the protocol from the fluctuating price of FCT. So unlike Ethereum and others where the transaction cost is unknown and may be 10x 100x in a month when congested or just slightly different everyday, people looking to secure data on Factom know the exact cost now and in the future [(incredible cheap $0.001/kb)](
[This article explains the two token system and need for FCT token better than I will](
It can take a while to fully grasp, and you are totally right to be sceptical of all systems, most the token economics aren't right at all - both to be a useable system, or having any reason for the token. But if you look into it, i'm sure you will see the merits of the two-token system, aswel as the need for an FCT token and the way FCT burning can create a floor price from usage (not a thing in almost any other project) and good token economics.
Sorry for waffle and I do agree, most tokens don't actually use the token in any other way. Factom guarantees price stability (which is insanely huge for adoption at this stage especially) &amp; also allows anyone to set up their own services allowing people to secure their systems without them having to know how or even that they are using a blockchain.

[Factom was used as evidence to win court case in China this year](
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has explicit said in press releases, articles and many times in senate hearings that they desperately need a way to secure their data and make it tamper-proof. [They have taken on Factom Inc. through their  Silicon Valley Innovation Program, taking them through all 4 stages, awarding the highest amount in grants at each stage]( They have said they are happy with the progress and also that other departments have been interested, so it's definitely a problem that *someone* is needing solved right now at least ;)

- The cost's can be 1000's of times lower (making usecases where millions+ documents need to be secured very feasible)
- The cost can be kept constant, which allows businesses/governments to plan spending and actually use it, also two token system allows others to provide subscription services for them without them having to know they are using crypto
- TPS isn't feasible on btc, lightning is not the same as not on chain, transactions need to be stored as that is the only way you can secure data, and a way to secure data is extremely needed and will only become increasingly more so in future. TPS once sharding is completed TPS should be many thousands of times bitcoin making a lot more usecases possible (was designed to shard from the start and is pure data, so way easier than ETH to shard)
I'm pretty much a bitcoin maxamilist, have been very heavily involved for around 6 years in the space, very sceptical of all other coins... but you have to realise there's a chance some other coins can fill use cases btc can't by itself (or won't be able to till many many years in the future). No matter to me what you do, but I would recommend you look at some other projects as well (with a sceptical eye), as there are a handful of diamonds

Factom my friend :)
Lots of different projects looking at the supply chain with it at the moment. But major one that is public is [Linxen's dLoc (can also be used for authenticating Passports / Birth certificates / Driving licences / Qualificatons etc.)]( - dLoc uses Factom to secure the data, as it's incredibly cheap (always $0.001 p/kb to store on public chain, archors into bitcoin for security, 2 token system to keep transaction price stable, and when sharding finished should be able to handle many thousands of tps)
[Linxen's currently make the US passports and many others, plus smartchips for a lot of debit/cards of the world]( Say 80% of the population use one of their products.
Do love VeChain's sleek look and partnerships (am invested) but have a lot of doubts about their unknown nodes and control of VeChain company and also how they will maintain the cost of tansactions. Also rewarding the rich with a higher percentage seems just wrong (more for holding more ok.. but why should the richest gain money double as fast % too??)
Ultimately the world will get some good solutions and streamline/ cut out a lot of fakery and gain data on inefficiencies by blockchain for supply chains, looking forward to it!
