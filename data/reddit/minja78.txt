1. So T,D,&amp;H are putting bitcoins into savings to offset a loss? 
2. So T,D,&amp;H are under no legal obligation to cover a loss? 
3.  I guess 1. kind of answers this one.  
I'm all for transparency in the industry.  I tried to research My companies perimeters for assigning an Insurance score.  
It's apparently like butches bakes beans recipe.  
I know its credit based, I know it doesn't count tickets, accidents, insurance history, cars, coverage or multiple policies.  I've seen an 819 fico have a lower Insurance score than a 680 fico.   Fucking bizarre if you ask me.   
All that said I want transparency and I commend you for trying but this idea needs a lot of work.

I think your research should have started with some definitions: *keep in mind I'm not attacking your idea I just pointing out what a lawyer is going to tell you down the road* 
  
Insurance Definitions:  






You seem to be under the impression that you aren't selling insurance so you don't need or have to be regulated by the insurance industry.  You are trying to create an insurance company there is no way around that, you're pooling premium payments to cover a loss.  You could pay with horses pet rocks vs bitcoin and it would still be insurance.  That said you're going to have to answer to the insurance commissioner in each state. Bitcoin isn't going to get you around the plethora of law, rules, and regulations.  
Correct me if I'm wrong but adding the insurance commissioner to your plan basically breaks everything.  
Good luck.

I'd love to see the sales pitch on this.  
1. Tom, dick, and harry all pay 100 per month to their team for 12 months.  Dick's house burns down how's he getting paid?  
2. How can you have insurance without a contract?   Tom, Dick, And Harry all need some sort of assurance that they have insurance. 
3. Aren't the premium payments going into a master Wallet?
