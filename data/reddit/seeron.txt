What is FUD?

Can you make a suggestion on hardware wallets and malware software please.
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:51:44
Actually posted in multiple places at the same time cause I was frantic after losing trust in my computer and $15k in crypto.  But not begging anybody for anything and not a bot.
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:12:32
It honestly happened so fast.  I just figured if I copied/pasted then no issue as I have never manually typed in btc addresses.  This totally caught me off-guard.

Which hardware wallet should I purchase?  And are there any dangers to them I should be aware of?
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:16:20


Well, should I use AiroAV, Sophos, Mcafee, Bit Defender?  Would appreciate a recommendation to remain clean cause this cost me $15k already.

Using [Blockchain.info](  \- in this instance where I lost money was using a web browser on my windows machine, but I also have it as an app on my iphone.  Never had problems with it.

Thanks, I appreciate the support :)

Unfortunately I didn't install one.  I feel like such an idiot!!!
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:25:51


Would love to know myself.
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:26:42
Just looked that up.  Thanks, I'm now researching everything being said here and learning a lot.

Unfortunately, I didn't install any malware removal tools prior to this happening.  I feel so depressed right now.

This was a copy and paste.  Didn't manually type the address.  So obviously whenever I type in the address, it manipulates something to change to another address.  I am going home in around an hour (still at work) and immediately downloading Malwarebytes as that seems to be the community recommendation.  I am interested in these hardware wallets but also want to know if they have vulnerabilities.

Using [Blockchain.info](
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:40:06
I have been also want to scan them to ensure no malware infected them.  That's why I'm asking which I should use.
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:05:44
The machine infected was Windows 10 with all security updates.   I honestly didn't notice anything til after I copied/pasted the blockchain verification to send to the intended receiving party pending verification via email.  So took like 10 minutes for them to reply it wasn't their address.  Only when I compared did I realize what had happened.  I'm afraid to login to [Blockchain.info]( on the infected Windows computer as I first want to remove the malware.  I'm stuck using my Mac laptop now to communicate which uses AiroAV antivirus but unfortunately, AiroAV doesn't work on Windows.  I feel so violated right now.

I had no idea this technique was possible.
