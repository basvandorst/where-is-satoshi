If the economy crashes, crypto crashes with it. People will pull money from crypto to pay bills and cover losses
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:06:16
ill do it for a small fee of 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:54:03
Down 50% in the last 3 months. Very stable. Damn you guys crack me up
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:54:55
But dude it’s FREE!!!1!! 
-idiots who probably don’t contribute to healthcare being “free”
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:24:41
Yeah and the funding source wouldn’t be their own wallets
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:18:25
The less places accept bitcoin, the lower the price goes
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:28:12
Just like when it goes down 8% in 30 minutes right?
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:50:30
When you have to give people lessons to use crypto, you know we’re not even close to adoption. It needs to be as using things like visa or venmo 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:52:52
There’s no point in using bitcoin over fiat if you can only use bitcoin in 5% of places where you can use fiat everywhere.
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:28:48
And I’m sure this guy put 10k into bitcoin @ 18k lmao these people are fucking idiots man, there’s no point in trying to argue with them
@_date: 2018-05-01 04:18:31
Back to r/buttcoin you go
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:17:50
Hmm OP and all the comments are from reddit accounts 5 days old....
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:05:41
How can it be priced in when no one in hell even knows the true value of bitcoin? Shit goes up and down 50% every month. This isn’t the stock market
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:19:00
you still around? Did you HODL?
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:51:05
I dont think I've paid my bank anything in 11 years to hold my money. You poors must have &lt;$1500 in your accounts
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:28:39
Past results....
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:32:14
Take your money out of bitcoin and invest in learning English
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:55:50
Exactly. Dentist is losing money doing them at that price. Must be overcharging for the abutment and crown
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:19:41
Nah actually looking at the small print. Reatoration must be done in the office. Restoring it will probably cost about $1500 so the patient is still paying roughly $2000. Still a good deal regardless because normally it’ll cost $2700-3000
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:07:17
Hell yeah brother KKona
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:31:09
Madden 04 was the best mike vick on the cover
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:38:50
Just like this meme
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:11:05
It's the common folk we need to get onboard. If it's not easy enough for your 70 year old grandma to use, it will never work
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:44:47
That feel when when
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:39:21
Got it. Waiting until Saturday to buy more btc
@_date: 2018-11-08 06:21:42
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:05:08
This could work for just about anything investment related, not just bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:56:28
Oh really? Who made you the judge of who’s made for crypto? I was just making a comment my dude. $500 is less than 0.5% of what I make in a year so I’m not worried
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:28:27
Oh great we have a fortune teller on our hands. When should we buy in?
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:23:49
Just hope this is the bottom friend
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:43:11
Why don’t you just say you have .552 BTC? Or do you mean you have .552mBTC?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:18:09
Me: ITS HIGH NOON
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:19:56
I invested $500 at $9300 then 3 hours later it’s $8700. Great timing right? Time to HODL I suppose
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:45:58
Sell and never come back
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:46:03
What? I’m chill my dude
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:13:55


@_date: 2018-03-09 15:19:15
Hmmm doesn’t look like it got under 8k. I’m starting to question your abilities as a fortune teller
@_date: 2018-07-02 18:11:17
Average crypto redditor right here
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:59:03
Here ya go ���� r/politics
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:41:42
OP put this up for karma... move along
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:29:00
Yeah doing stuff like making crayons!
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:18:38
You do know that 99.99% of the world accepts FIAT and not bitcoin right?
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:23:54
Donating to a guy who already makes $500,000 per month from subs LOL
This is not adoption
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:15:01
Invest what you can afford to lose, but I feel like in 5 years we’re gonna wish we invested everything 
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:35:23
Pump eet 
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:02:11
That’s the time to buy bud
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:51:38
You had 2 weeks to buy in at 7k now you’re FOMOing hahaha
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:23:23
Or do the opposite of which side has more money
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:21:43
I think we're very far off from it becoming mainstream. You cant have a currency that changes 10% in value on a daily basis
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:38:44
But that makes sense for fiat ATMs because you get physical money. Bitcoin can be bought and used digital 24/7
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:25:50
Someone disconnects the bitcoin server obviously. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:56:57
Wouldn’t exchanges just be the new banks?
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:55:19
FUD.... it’ll be 250k
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:37:58
Oh no not a -10% day how will I ever survive
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:29:03
Buy high sell low right?
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:28:06
Can anyone actually explain the point? You’re paying 10% more for bitcoin through this shit
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:38:45
Easiest is Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:52:24
FOMO SEASON
