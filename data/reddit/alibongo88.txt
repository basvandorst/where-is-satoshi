Give us this Bitcoin  our daily reward.
And forgive us our trespasses,

And lead us not into alt-coin temptation, 
But deliver us from the evil banks. 
For thine is the kingdom, 
The power, and the glory, 
For ever and ever.

It is possible to envision a future where this technology creates a form of ‘glass 
government’ that is more accountable to the citizen. There are a number of use 
cases, and as the technology progresses it is almost certain more will emerge. 
This may help to achieve policy objectives. The key points for ministers and the 
civil service are: 
The technology is in its early stages but shows significant promise. To unlock 
the promise of block chain technology, it is essential to understand how the 
combination of:
• Reconciliation through cryptography
• Large scale, secure replication of data
• Provable Transparency 
can be used over three horizons:
• Supporting the emerging ecosystem
• Early trials and pilots
• Positioning the UK as a global leader

2) Call in moneys owed to you and pay off or renegotiate debts
3) Do not store money in the bank, stash cash notes somewhere safe
4) Convert all equity and bond investments, as well as pensions to cash
5) Hold US dollar and bitcoin in equal amounts
6) If you don’t own a house or apartment already, prefer rental
7) Sit out the deflationary recession and plan to make significant purchases and business expenses in the new cheaper business cycle

Just got a dm;
from levlufian sent 51 minutes ago
Hello, I would like to apologize to you. I did not think my messages were very bad, but the overwhelmingly negative reaction surprised me. Thats why I want to say I am sorry and give you a bit of explanation.
The reason I started sending these messages is mainly because I believe in Ethereum long term. For a long time I tried discussing with people on ways to improve bitcoin, but anything that doubts the status quo is immidiately downvoted or censored.
When I found out about Ethereum I was amazed that most of the ideas I though of before were actually already implemented in it. So I wondered why I never read about it in the common information channels.
Then I realized, the censorship in is much more deep-rooted than just theymos, it is actually most of the community. So many of the participants really want the value of bitcoin to go up and get rich quick that they are incentiviced to downvote anyone who doubts the current decisions of the status quo.
Then I realized I can easily by-pass the censorship by sending private messages, there is nothing the status quo can do about that. All I want to do it try to inspire people like me to find the information they need to make a rational informed decision.

Something went wrong. When I  first saw this a few hours  ago, I clicked on the video, it prompted me to  pay 25c, nothing  wrong with  that. I decided to try  it out later as I didn't have any  btc on the device  I was using  (smartphone). When I tried it this time round it was different , when I clicked the  video it instead  prompted me to  sign up to Popchest  (which I did), then I tried  again but this time it redirected  me to sign up to  Coinbase. ?? I've since tried several times more with the same result. WTF?

I watched a bit of his Webcast,  he claims that he split the 38000 btc into 10 separate transactions. So if he's  telling the truth then there should be should be 10 transactions of 3800 clumped together on the Blockchain a little bit before he first tweeted about it. Should be easy enough to find out if he is bullshiting or not, right?

These greedy fu*ks still don't get it.  Yes the blockchain is great but without Bitcoin i.e. The miner's validating and ultimately making the whole system safe, secure and quick to use, you have nothing. I repeat (if anyone from Forbes happenes to be reading this or any other greedy financial  institution, please read the following sentence very slowly and just give it 2 or 3 minutes to settle in) BITCOIN and the BLOCKCHAIN come together as a package, if you try to separate them you have NOTHING!

I posted a tin hat theory the other day about why 21M btc, I suggested it could be that the inventor was 21 years old at the time. I've just had a quick look at Amir Taaki's Wikipedia page and he sort of fits my theory he is currently 27 old so he would have been 20/21 around the time Bitcoin first came to light. My theory all depends on when the 21million figure was first established.  But then again, I haven't done any substantial research like I said it's a tin hat theory lol but it's always good to theorize.

Yeah you are probably right but the majority of people have been conditioned from a young age to respect and blindly accept what the police and anyone of authority wearing a costume with a shiny badge say and do.  Even after the cop realalised Andrew was in the right, that didn't matter,  people in a position of power absolutely hate admitting they are wrong especially police ( don't get me wrong, there are a lot of police out there doing a great job but there are a lot like this one too ) Also I think the by standers did the right thing by just getting there smartphones out and recording it. Imagine this happening before smartphones were invented,  I believe that we wouldn't have even heard about this story let alone been able to send him some btc. Most likly people would have just walked by or just completely ignored it and the cop would have just fabricated a phoney change.

Here's some data from roughly the same time last year. 
The Catalan region has long been the industrial heartland of Spain – first for its maritime power and trade in goods such as textiles, but recently for finance, services and hi-tech companies.
It is one of the wealthiest regions of Spain - it accounts for 18.8pc of Spanish GDP, compared to 17.6pc from Madrid. Madrid, however, has a higher per capita GDP.
Secession would therefore cost Spain almost 20 per cent of its economic output, and trigger a row about how to carve up the sovereign’s 836 billion euros of debt.
It would have a gross domestic product of $314 billion (£195bn), according to calculations by the OECD, which would make it the 34th largest economy in the world. That would make it bigger than Portugal or Hong Kong.
Its GDP per capita would be $35,000, which would make it wealthier than South Korea, Israel or Italy.
And Catalonia's contribution to the Spanish economy is twice that of Scotland’s to the UK.

Don't get me wrong,  I see Bitcoin as the better ride. 
The old system reminds me of an old,  small/ dark/ rickety haunted house ride, where poorly paid actors come out of nowhere and shit you up. 
Bitcoin is more ls more like the newest/fastest/most secure roller coasters imaginable.  Outside in the light where you and everone can see which way you are going (no matter how scary it looks).

I thought I should revisit this thread because I mentioned before about the percentage of bitcoin around the world in particular the USA and China.  After a quick Google search ( I would have done a more in depth search but because I decided/remembered to do this this just before I go to sleep its just a quick one lol ) this is what I found; 
And this
So if these figures are still roughly correct then it's safe to assume the USA would benefit from this the most followed by Asia ie China.  Obviously good old satoshi nakamoto would be the biggest winner with nearly 1M btc. But again I think it's safe to assume he/she/they are American but I could be wrong on that one lol, only time will tell.

Usually I would be the first to agree with you but this time might be different.  I wonder what percentage of bitcoins are held in the US and more specifically by the US government. There may be a second side to this as well. I'm not sure so correct me if I'm wrong but I think China is in the lead when it comes to percentage of Bitcoin so if that's true then China would benefit the most from this. And I don't believe the US is dumb enough to go against China. But I may be wrong.

The way I see it is, if Bitcoin became the dominant currency in the world(99-100% adoption), the government's ability fund wars would reduce dramatically due to $£€¥ being devalued and particularly obsolete.  So basically it would be pointless for government's to ask the banks for more worthless fiat money to fund phony wars. I am not saying all wars will end due to Bitcoin, that would be a stupid thing to say. I'm just saying it would be greatly reduced. If there was a legitimate reason for war then fair enough, they could raise funds by people donating Bitcoin,  mining or whatever, they would find a way. Also imagine Bitcoin becomes the world currency, governments around the world would have to be very careful about how they spend their "bits" because 1) now everyone can see where that money is going, so no more misallocation of wealth or backhand deals and 2) you can't just create as many Bitcoins as you want out of thin air, there will only be 21m Bitcoins produced ever, this would mean no more going to war and not worrying about the costs. With today's monetary system this isn't so, governments take us into wars by borrowing more money from central banks at the burden of the taxpayer later on, creating more and more debt.

That's why digital currency is very important. It's used for all this bad stuff.".. Is there a video of this guy saying it?  I bet not. It seems too simple for someone in the secret service to say.  The grammar is weird and seems too constructed.

It's pretty much the same trend with all YouTube channels which uploads a video about Bitcoin. Although it seems probable the majority of views are from Bitcoin believer's(myself included), there has been a steady increase in views over the past few years, months, weeks and days. I remember only a few year's ago Bitcoin video's would take weeks or months to reach the same number which only takes days now.

Here's the full quote:
   " Many of you have heard about not only bitcoins but blockchains and that unbelievable technology that underlies the Bitcoins of this world at the moment, and how incredibly convenient it will be to actually generate trust and identify players and whatever pseudo they decide to use.
    And many of you in the industry are actually worried that those technologies are going to massively disrupt the current industry.
    Pause for a second.
    If those new technologies and as long as those new technologies are going to abuse, take advantage of, the yield for anonymity, I think the banking industry has quite a few good days ahead of it as long as it takes ownership of those issues of capital and culture in order to actually restore the trust without which you see no trade no transaction no business can take place."

It all depends on which bitcoin wallets you choose to use. If you just do a little research you'll soon discover there are in fact some bitcoin wallets which are fully insured in the event of loss due to online hack. I believe Xapo and one other which I cannot currently recall but I'm sure someone on here will soon post a list with links. Also I remember reading recently that there are many more fully insured online wallets/bitcoin company's coming very soon.

How Does It Work?
We are a cooperative. To join the cooperative you need one share (30 Euros). You also need to pay a onetime membership fee (30 Euros). In other words, the minimum amount of money needed to join is 60 Euros. Your first share will give you one vote. You can also buy as many additional shares (30 Euros each) you want. There is no upper limit to your investment.
Every member has one vote independent of the amount of shares you have. You can use your vote in member meetings, where we decide on important co-op issues. As a member you can suggest Robin Hood Projects, become part of the selection board and participate in the work of the cooperative.
You can buy shares by clicking the green BUY SHARES button. When you click this button several fields appear. One that asks the amount of shares, another that asks you to choose one of the six options about how you want to divide your net profits (profit minus co-op’s costs) between you and Robin Hood Projects. If you choose to keep more than 50% of the profit, there is a onetime fee.
Once a month, the money invested in shares will be exchanged in dollars and sent to our broker, Interactive Brokers, in New York. That creates a new series, which will be invested in stock exchange, according to the information from our algorithm. Thus, the performance of the investment depends both on the euro/dollar exchange rate fluctuations and the success of our investment portfolio on the stock exchange. Please note: There are no guarantees as past performance is not an indication of the future results.
We are a ‘slow’ investment organization. If you would like to sell your shares, you will need to notify the co-op. We are regulated by the co-operative law of Finland and other Finnish regulations. The actual value of each share is calculated after the end of the fiscal year (end of June) when costs of the co-operative are deducted from them. The Finnish law lets us transfer monies from sold shares earliest six months after the end of the fiscal year. You can also sell your shares to other members. Your membership can be canceled at any time by letting the co-op management know in writing.

Although Bitcoin wasn't mentioned specifically, reading between the lines, the uk are going to try to leave Bitcoin alone. 
A spokesman for TechUK, the UK's technology trade association, said: "With the right resources and cooperation between the security agencies and technology companies, alongside a clear legal framework for that cooperation, we can ensure both national security and economic security are upheld."
The TechUK spokesman told the programme: "From huge volumes of financial transactions to personal details held on devices, the security of digital communications fundamentally underpins the UK economy.
"Encryption is an essential component of the modern world and ensures the UK retains its position as one of the world's leading economies.
"We have to make sure we reach the right balance by ensuring the fundamental principles of privacy are upheld so there's a lot of work for legislators and tech firms to do."

I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.

Ahh ok. 
I'm inclined to think that a large number (if not the majority) of people investing in Bitcoin believe that price will rise after the Halving due to obvious reasons (supply and demand). But of course     nobody truly knows what is going to happen, but, within this large group of people (imo) who believe  the price will rise, there's bound to be a few  (with deep pockets) who will try there best to short the market just before the Halving in an attempt to cause a panic sell off and then simply buy back in at a lower price. Unfortunately , with the Bitcoin market cap of a little over 10 billion dollars  (which sounds a lot, but it's nothing really compared to other assets) this type of stunt is possible. 
I'm not suggesting the price will rocket immediately after the Halving, it's more likely to be delayed slightly like last time.
But again, nobody knows. I'm just suggesting it's a possibility which I'm inclined to believe.

You are correct daveime I did skip the second half of the article (my bad lol). But after taking a second look I still think it is good news for bitcoin. I've taken into consideration the part of the article you copied and pasted.  Firstly I would have totally agreed with you, a few months ago. But the fact is bitcoin has matured and is evolving at an incredible pace. Also consider exclusivity of Apple pay, compared this to bitcoin which (correct me if I'm wrong) can be used by Apple customers as well as the majority of devices with Internet capabilities. I also tend to agree with the bitcoin experts who believe Apple pay will just help people get used to the idea of using their smartphones/devices and this in turn will make possible the transition to bitcoin easier after realising its superiority eg micro transactions, low to zero fees ect.

Different countries sometimes have different classifications on what Bitcoin is. So the first thing you need to do is find out what the legal status of Bitcoin is in each country, i.e. currency/asset/commodity. Then just check if this (ridiculous) 25% tax law applies. If it doesn't apply, congratulations, you found a loophole in the system. But if you don't find a loophole, convert your money into Bitcoin anyway and tell them they'll have to accept the 25% in Bitcoin lol. If they accept this then they'll probably have to rewrite the law to include Bitcoin as well as regular money and if they did that, Bitcoin would become more legitimate and most likely cause the price of Bitcoin to increase in value. Good luck. lol

I've just tried your link but  unfortunately got the same result. Maybe they just restricted access to the UK? I'm going to try the other guys advice, but thanks anyway.

Joe has been doing longer and longer podcasts lately, 4-5 hours seems to be the new limit/norm. Although 3 hours would still be great, 4-5-6 hours would be Amazing and more appropriate imo considering the complex subject matter that is Bitcoin. Either way, this podcast will be excellent, i'm sure. 
Keep doing what you're doing Andreas, you're a fucking Bitcoin legend/superhero!

Thank you Bitcoin community for the introduction to to this amazing show. Mr. Robot is extremely well written, I'm now an addict. I ended up doing a marathon and watched every episode including the first episode of the new season with the Bitcoin truck lol. 
I bet this won't be the last time we see or hear about Bitcoin on the show and I'm looking forward to seeing how they play around with it......Watch this space!!!
F Society!!! Buy Bitcoin and Hodl!!!! Lol

Yes,  I would say so. Anyone or any large institution with enough capital and incentive can and will attack Bitcoin at any opportunity.

What more could Greece possibly loose from integrating into Bitcoin. Imagine the inpact this would have. Remember what happened to the price of BTC when Cyprus collapsed. Greece has over 10 x the population of Cyprus.  Do the math!

What's the catch?
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:25:56
Nothing to see here, just people manipulating the market just before the Halving to get cheaper coins. This was expected imo.

Perhaps I should have been more clear in the description, I'm not saying nor do I believe  Craig Wright is satoshi. I thought using quotations marks would have made that apparent, but obviously not. Oh well, my bad. Lol
