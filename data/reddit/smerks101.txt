Its not a comedy at all, its a drama all the way.

He put it out with absolutely no promotion and is now promoting it, it literally appeared on his site one day. That being said it could be one of the best pieces of drama put out in years.

I have a question about tracking something like this, using something like walletexplorer these coins can be followed pretty easily, right?
If that is the case is there someone who might want to get involved to help the NYPD track this a bit, I can only see something like that being a boon for the community.

What are your limits on Circle? Im at $3000 from the start it seems.

Oh wow I wonder why it is so low for you but they have me at 3k and Ive never used them. Though I did have the account open a while with CC/Debit and ACH connected to it.

I sent this email quite a while ago and havent heard back...
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:17:15
I got the response and you guys are a joke, and this just wasted my time. Good bye and I really look forward to the market expanding and all the ill will Coinbase has built up coming to bear and putting you guys under.

I have been a verified customer able to purchase instantly for a long time, 2+ yrs. This is all due to changing my address and now somehow I cannot purchase instantly using my bank account with a CC backup. The option to buy using my CC/Debit triples my fees and costs to purchase and is unacceptable to me.

I didnt think of the DNM thing coming to bite except in the context of if they asked I would tell them I sell coin but now I see thats not an option. 
The tumbler adds a fee though and wouldnt that cut into 10% pretty fast? I think 15-20% would be more fair but I guess it depends on what the perosn buying them is using it for.

Ill check it out. But since they requested my account information I will give them one last shot to keep me as a customer. But this is pretty absurd and really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I move around more than most people so problems due to address changes are magnified by 1000 for me. Most people never move so its a 1 off thing. Ive moved more times in the last 3 years than some do in a lifetime.

no kidding I did not know that
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:02:12
The fact that you changed something that worked based on my only changing my address is ridiculous, the canned answers are unacceptable and unless my account is reverted to the way it was 48 hours ago Im gone for good. My circle account is already created and ready to go.
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:28:30
why would they care?

Every pyramid, mlm, ponzi scheme I have ever heard a pitch for always starts out by bringing it up and immediately telling how different they are from whatever scheme they are trying to pull off.
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:36:02
Its completely disgusting how they treat customers, its ridiculous that their horrific verification system doesnt work any better after years of being in place yet they have the same canned responses in place for it. Overall they drove me off to a competitor and got me mad enough to post about it on social media and here, so clearly they have issues. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:32:34
I have to ask since I have heard nothing in almost a day since you asked for me to email in, did you just ask me for my info for show so reddit thinks you actually are helping me? 
@_date: 2015-10-12 01:19:42
no thoughts there on pricing form what I saw at first glance. I would think in person cash transactions are a premium service, no?
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:10:10
most of them are on the razors edge of legality and are usually complete sucker plays where 99% of people involved make nothing.
