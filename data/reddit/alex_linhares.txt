Thanks! Corrected. What a ridiculous mistake...
I hope accepts.

Thank you, Coinbase!  
My bet on the next one is Xapo.

At other *unrelated* subs, people have been for weeks talking about getting out while the getting is good.  
You know, those people that went for the satoshi vision of raising the blocksize way back in 2010... who would imagine they would be unsatisfied?

Bill for his travel expenses is on me, of course.

Some of the many reasons:
* Geography of time  
* Mosquitos driving down productivity 
* You guys killed all the way to the Pacific... opening a vast trade route.  We were too lazy and just killed halfway.  
PS.  Bonus:  you guys went for world-empire.  We didn't.

There are thermodynamics limits in play here.  Some things can't be done unless you happen to just accidentally break the laws of physics.

Pub key isn't published, only a hash.  Pub key appears when you sign and spend.

The US also outlawed shorting in 2008...

I guess I was confused by the word "election".

So far so good...  here's where I get stuck:


What I'm not getting is that the public key for "Bitcoin Czar" must be chosen at time t.  So at t+s, a new miner joining the network, whom by definition has no previous coinbase address, can never be elected.  And hence, it seems to me, they can never find a block. 
TLDR: If you dont have a coinbase address you can't get a coinbase address? 
I must be missing out on something, but I can't see what.

""Unlike Bitcoin, a key block contains a public key that will be used in the subsequent microblocks"". 
Here's what I don't get.  No *new* miners?  To be elected, at least after my brief skimming of the paper, a miner has to be already known to the network.  
I can see solutions to this, but is my first perception right?
