During a long night out you need to alternate beer with some water to prevent yourself from getting too drunk. ;)

I came here to say the same thing. The black market helped jump-start Bitcoin a lot in the beginning.

I went to the website that's listed on the card. It looks like you're just buying a voucher to receive that amount of Bitcoin when you redeem the card. So if the value was to crash 10 minutes after buying the card; you'd still get $100 of Bitcoin. (Just more of it due to the price crashing) 
Edit: Fine print from the site:


This would make me hesitate to purchase the cards. They're allowed to set the exchange price at what ever they want no matter the price at other exchanges. Hopefully they keep their exchange rate around where it should be.

So much this. You might want to pull that; full name is shown, and it's not hard to guess what bank you're with. Someone could try to track you down. :(

The Fury was originally listed as using 30w of power so it's not a huge change. 
I agree that GAW should have emailed their customers about the change in power consumption. They really need to have an area on their homepage with these announcements other then the Bitcointalk forum. 
However, the hosted GAW miners are coming online, and the initial impressions are that people are getting above the advertised hashrate. The miners appear to be real. 
The ZenMiner controllers are included with the orders, and hopefully software to mine using other platforms will be released. If they're using a fork of CGMiner or a similar opensource miner; they have to release the source code to comply with the licensing agreements. 
The big question now is will they meet their ship date of May 26th?

Is that why they named the webpage the pop clock? ;)

GAW Miners? ;)

I don't see why it would have to. IMO both Bitcoin and gold can co-exist; gold for physical storage of wealth, and Bitcoin for digital storage of wealth. The yin and yang of assets. :)

TigerDirect is pretty much NewEgg and Best Buy having a baby. They sell similar items as NewEgg and they have a large online presence. However, they also have a few brick and mortar locations; and usually higher prices like Best Buy. ;)

Seems like a solid plan. I wish that more people would spread out their purchases like that; less risk that way, and it would keep the price more stable. 
Best of luck; and hopefully you'll be looking at $15,000 worth of Bitcoin soon. :D

Is Bitsider going to be a BTC exchange service? 
@_date: 2014-07-18 03:20:05


Everyone involved with this initial draft should resign due to screwing this one up so badly. 
Reads more like something a puppet from the traditional banking sector would come up with.

From the title I thought you meant that you spent 1BTC on the gift. :P
Glad to hear that gyft is legit; I'll keep them in mind if I ever need a giftcard.

100% This. You never know if they are also using a drive-by exploit to install wallet stealing malware. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:53:51


Hard drives actually aren't sealed 100%. [There is a filtered air pressure vent that could have let water enter inside the drive.](
Could water enter through this filter? I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if it could in flood conditions.

Why did GAW decide to rush the release on PayCoin? 
None of the infrastructure was ready; Amazon integration in PayBase was hacked together, (Amazon won't allow what you guys have planned, so no surprise that it's not working) the expectation of a $20 floor that you knew would never materialize. 
I think the reason why most people are screaming about Ponzi / Scam is because of just how poorly ZenCloud / PayCoin / PayBase has been managed. It's either all an elaborate scam / Ponzi, or GAW is one of the worst managed, incompetent companies in the crypto community. Either of which is a recipe for the disaster we're seeing now.

Do you have the BTC address?

Looks like Shapeshift finally dropped ~~PlayCoin~~ PayCoin. Took them long enough, but at least they finally did something.

When the average Joe gets screwed by the traditional banking system they blame the bank, not the system. 
They're not going to look for an alternative monetary system just because their current bank is crap; at most they change their bank. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:59:00


BTCMiami accepting PayBase as a sponsor makes me really question their integrity. 
From their website: 


Accepting funds from a company that has denounced Bitcoin and having its CEO talk during the conference is accomplishing this goal? Do they even vet companies that want to be a part of the conference?

FYI: The exchange they purchased is Coin-Swap. ~~I'll try to find the link stating this.~~ Edit: [Twitter Announcement](
I'd recommend pulling any BTC you have stored with Coin-Swap.
