Actually a lot of people start really using Reddit for the first time when they get interested in a community that is using Reddit as a major discussion platform. Cryptos are in that basket. You are a passive reader, you feel strongly about a debate, you register in order to share your opinion.
Sure, they can be spam accounts, but they can as easily be real users − albeit likely to be newbies at cryptos.

No, it is not only meant for microtransactions. Large transactions might not come at very low fees as they force intermediary nodes to perform rebalancing operations, but that might still be a lot lower than blockchain fees. $10-$100 transactions might end up common enough for the channels to be tuned to handling them without much rebalancingn needed.

The OP asked for a way to measure progress, and Aubrey de Grey answered there is no such way. This is the right answer. Take cancer for example. Are we at 50% to curing it ? 95 % ? 5% ? Hard to tell…
If you want a quick overview of the progress made (albeit not in the form of a progress bar), you can browse quickly this per-year bulleted list from [Fight Aging](

You are not supposed to be here, on the Internet. You are not supposed to wear clothes. I may have a few other things to point out. 
More seriously, that's what we do. We break the rules and make new ones. We discover fire and harvest its power to build cities and rocket our way to other planets.

Modern medicine was a "dick move" by rich people. Developing countries wildly benefit from it today. So do they from smartphones and the Internet. Very dicky of rich people to have focused so much ressource on that.
Thanks to improving supply infrastructures and information systems, the time between a new technology being mass produced for westerners and developing countries getting access to it keeps on decreasing. They will benefit from cures against aging.

u/deannolan, I must insist on [SENS Research Foundation]( (suggested by others on previous days). Aging kills 40 million people every year. There is by far nothing deadlier than that. It is only a matter of time before we cure most of it. For every year we accelerate the field by, 40 million lives are effectively saved. SENS has made large progress with little funding, so a 1 BTC donation would have a significant impact.

Going that way, the preferred procedure would be to hash with salt. Otherwise the server owner can log to any website that uses the same hash function.

A full genome sequencing is reaching under USD1k, dropping in an exponential fashion.
One BTC is reaching over USD1k, increasing in an exponential fashion.
I am waiting for a sequencing company to accept bitcoins − and maybe it will so happen to cost BTC 1 at that moment.

GET over HTTPS is much safer than POST over HTTP.
HTTPS URLs are fully encrypted end to end, and so is the password in this use case. The only risk is somebody looking over your shoulder − literally.

2:1 comes at no risk − you can withdraw your bought bitcoins from other exchanges right now. Therefore, the only gain from the risk taken is the difference from MtGox and other exchanges right now, which is about 2 folds. How much to you judge the risk of insolvency ? If that is higher than 50%, then you are crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:41:45
Right, I was not considering the block reward —only the fees. As you say, we can only hope that the price does not grow much faster than the block reward decreases. 
At some point though, we can expect the price to stop growing as fast as the rewards halve —most growths follow a S curve. Then miners will make most of their money on fees, and LN will indeed prevent a large part of that money from being burnt into heat.

It could be added bones, but beyond that, if what we really enjoy is tender and fatty, then cultured meat will excel at it way beyond what animals naturally produce. Think how much sweeter are deserts compared to fruits.

I'm actually not sure what you mean.

And one needs to kill a mistreated fellow animal to enjoy oneself.
Let's direct our enthusiasm and buying power where it matters. Vertical farming and cultured meat are going to revolutionize the food industry like Bitcoin is revolutionizing the financial industry.

How would 1/n blocks PoW consume any less energy ?
The way I see it is that instead of paying a fee to a PoW miner, I pay a (smaller) fee to a LN node. That money is not converted into electricity consumption −just return on investment for the LN node.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:17:39
Oh actually, we just got consensus for it, and it is being put in place in the coming days. It's the Lightning Network. Most of the transactions are going to be verified by mean of locking bitcoin funds (and checking signatures), all that happening in the 10 minutes between 2 PoW blocks.

Can't we encourage donations instead of imposing paywalls ? Information cannot be prevented from spreading, so better embrace it than fight it.

Hmm, yes and no. Yes if you are willing to wear a face mask at the ATM −and preferably on your way there too. Also, don't have your smartphone on you.

From what I understand, you send from your before-mixing address to a bitcointip address; from that first bitcointip address to another bitcointip address; finally from that last bitcointip address to your after-mixing address.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I think all those transations are kept in the blockchain connecting clearly before and after mixing addresses.

there are fees to this approach, and technically still traceability ― unless you know an altcoin exchange that guarantees to erase the exchange log.

I think Silk Road is a centralized server. Do they guarantee erasing transaction logs from it ? If not, in the ―unlikely?― event the server gets ceased by authorities, they could trace back your funds.

Users don't even have to do anything for a security fork to take place. Miners do. Most miners belong to a mining pool and/or are active members of the community. As long as the fork is uncontroversial, the majority of the mining power is guaranteed to apply it within a few hours. It's been demonstrated in practice.
