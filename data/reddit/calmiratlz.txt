Just install the new version, the old wallet and BTC will still work just the same.
Note, however, that the exchange rates were moved out of Preferences and into Plugins, so go to Tools -&gt; Plugins to enable displaying your currency of choice.

That's where Bitcoin needs to go mainstream first so it's an option. I asked for this a few times, but when walked through the process to register and buy Bitcoins, they basically said "Too much hassle. Take USD or we'll find someone else for the job."

Unlikely at this point. Too many people are invested in it. You can see an actual crash and its recovery here:

That's *very useful*! Thanks. Have you converted Bitcoin to ARS, and if so, got a recommendation on where?

Yes, the money wire is something **like** Western Union, though not Western Union. They work by buying stock of a company that trades both in the New York and Buenos Aires exchange and selling it locally. So what crosses the border is stock, not money, and thus gets past the standard controls.
Payoneer won't take payments from individuals, only registered companies. Most of my clients are small business that don't meet the 50 employee requirement.

Cost of living depends on how much money you can earn, though. A quick job that I can charge $200 USD to a client in the US can only be charged around $66 USD here (official rate; $44 USD parallel rate). So gathering those $4000 is much harder if you work locally.

I don't know specifically about Australia, but any services to send money outside the country are extremely restricted. Last I checked, Western Union only allowed up to $300 ARS to be sent -- which is less than $40 USD. All in the name of keeping the money in the country.

It's legal, but you get charged with import fees anyway, even if it's used. They open the mail at the border, determine the value of the item, and charge 50% import tax on that. If you are getting something used, and thus don't have a receipt, it's actually worse for you because they look up the price themselves -- and they don't exactly pick the cheapest price they find.

No, though our government has made a big show of being big allies of Venezuela, as if that were the greatest thing ever. Argentina.

Coinvoice has been mentioned on this thread before, I am looking into it. It looks like a huge step forward.
And yes, the customs office would confiscate such a card in a heartbeat. I was using a wiring service, but new regulations mean I can't use them anymore, either.

You're basically saying "throw away all the contacts and experience you have and start over, if you want to get paid in Bitcoins". That's not the right approach. Bitcoin needs to grow so it can be used everywhere, not become a closed circle where you need to work for "the right people".

Argentina. As an example of what the policies do to the economy, an iPhone 5S costs $3500 USD in the local market:
