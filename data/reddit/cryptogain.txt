But you can get rid of fiat for other goods/services much faster/easier then bitcoin, that was what they were trying to convey.

Head over to a bitcoin jobsfair or the local reddit bitcoin jobs thread and offer your services. Bitcoin economy 101.
Then watch as the value of the bitcoin's you recieve plummets first via inflation from miners and then via deflation from artificial shortage.

Amazing. A true pioneer, maybe even unknowingly placed himself ahead of Steve Jobs by accepting bitcoin. Only history will judge this but we all know this man is a legend.

Bitcoin requires advanced infrastructure to operate. High speed bandwith, electricity, smart phones. People who think bitcoin will somehow work in the 3rd world are delusional.

Agreed with the OP.
People should be grateful even for a fraction of a cent. Many of us are NOT early adopters and rich enough to hand out money. 
We give what we can. I even voted for dividing bitcoin by 1 billion not just 1 million decimal points.
Folks, everyday spread some satoshi's to new individuals, let them know how to empower themselves in this new economy. Bitcoin is the savings account we've been waiting for all our lives.

But bitcoin can't thats the problem. When you exchange BTC for other stuff the intermediary is fiat through services like bitpay/coinbase.
Why would people exchange real wealth for what computer hardware produces everyday from nothing?

This is a deliberate attack against bitcoin and against the bitcoin community. Trolls are now attempting to discredit BTC via establishment virus scanners. 
Downvote this topic. We've had enough negativity over the past 2 years to last a lifetime.

That's amazing news. Be sure to give back to the community by telling everyone around you about the gift from Satoshi Nakamoto.

I'm perfectly fine allowing those with much higher levels of wisdom and knowledge then me hold all the wealth in bitcoin. Their projects will benefit me and give me work in the long run. Think how much stress Roger Ver has for example and we get the reward ie the blockchain.info wallet. Satoshi Nakamoto deserves to be a billionaire for what he has given us. Being impoverished is ok if our benefactors are benevolent, like Roger Ver has been to this community. Thank you early adopters for setting the pace. Now it is up to us to carry the baton forward.

This is the killer app we have been waiting 5 years for folks.

It won't. Like all bitcoin companies except those exchanging in and out of fiat, circle will be a bust.
If you look at successful "technology" companies as a whole, they are just glorified ad pushers.
The most profitable strategy in crypto currencies has been betting against a wide array of bitcoin business's. The failure rate is near 99%.

Gavin is totally clueless which is normal for a failed developer.
Bitcoin's problem is miner subsidies. They increase in real value as the price rises putting extra expense on the network. This increases downside volatility.

Simply amazing.
I think we should also introduce the poor farmers of Uganda and all of Africa to Satoshi dice.
Why labor away all day? By simply borrowing bitcoins and then utilizing them on Satoshi dice, we give even the poorest amongst us the opportunity to reep a better life.
A tear came to my eye when I envisioned that poor sheep herder winning his first mBTC on Satoshi dice.
We Salute you DYMIX.
Ronald if you can read this head over to google and search for satoshi dice and just-dice if you want a better life.

Maybe you didn't realize that the vast majority of participants in bitcoin are impoverished? Around 100 individuals hold all the coins, so where pray tell me are we supposed to get BTC to tip with?
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:55:08
I gave this video a second look.
Ronald seems like your ATYPICAL lazy complainer about the world.
While his sister works hard in America and convinces people to send him charity, he spends his days strolling the streets and playing on his laptop.
Ronald had no qualms about putting in the effort to locate someone willing to exchange him BTC for Shillings since he understood it meant free money for him.
Soon Ronald will have many children with various women and begin appearing on the internet asking for assistance.
This video is empowering lazy individuals to seek help while they lament about the state of employment in their country.

No. He understood the telephone gave utility. Trading stuff in return for nothing in the hope that someone else pays you more for that nothing is not very rational.

0.3cents goes a long way in Africa. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:42:05
You really are greedy and selfish aren't you? Some of us are TRYING to spend our tiny stash of bitcoins by selflessly tipping great threads. I bet you were very happy to learn about the microsoft virus scanner detection.

The Bitcoin Foundation is the most important institution in the world at the moment.
I am proud to be a paid member and I believe Peter Vessenes could one day represent not only bitcoiners but the world.
Folks. We have arrived. Bitcoin to the moon.
Bitcoiners We Salute You.

BTC Technical analysis is the modern day magic.

Satoshi is the famous historical figure not me. 
Bitcoin allows the disillusioned to break away from the chains imposed onto them.
