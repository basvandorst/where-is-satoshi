ShadowCash FTW ;)
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:51:36
Yeah thats what I said "non-windows" GUI.  You must have trouble reading.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:50:35
Look up the word "fungibility" in a dictionary.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:57:25
Or a linux GUI?

I really love ShadowCash.  Monero is cool too, but not as easy to use.  Does ShadowCash have advantages over being tracked that Monero does not because of the minting of new tokens?
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:32:07
I really like what ShadowCash is doing.  Ring sigs built onto a bitcoin blockchain.  It allows it to plug in easier with existing infrastructure, and has benefits of both a transparent chain and an anonymous chain in one system.  Also it is easier to use than monero, because they actually have a good GUI HTML wallet. No need to trust others with your privacy by using MyMonero.
Shadow Project also has encryped messaging in their wallet. They also are planning a decentralized marketplace within their wallet.  If they can deliver on that, then this type of Evolution exit scam will be a thing of the past.

Ohh "smooth" one of the Monero devs says if you want a non-windows wallet, then you are limited to command line or MyMonero at this point.  Source:  
Doesn't sound very optional.  I am sure windows is perfectly safe for privacy and security too ::rolls eyes::

I will use ShadowCash instead.

I really wish Bitcoin would implement zerocash or sidechains that are anonymous.  But for alt-coins I like right now the coins that use ring signatures.  Usually they are cryptonote clones like Bytecoin, or Monero.  I prefer [ShadowCash]( because it is not a clone and is instead a unique implementation built by the devs.  
Also ShadowCash has the best of both worlds.  It has a transparent chain like Bitcoin, and also an anonymous token that uses ring signatures similar to cryptonote. The anonymous tokens exist in a type of 2-way peg to the main chain, similar to a sidechain.  This also has advantages because it can plug in with existing infrastructure much easier.  This is why for example shapeshift.io has added ShadowCash, but they have not added cryptonote coins yet.
 From my understanding the zkSNARKS are a type of cryptographic argument of knowledge that provides the best anonymity.  But right now SNARKS are still in development and not fully trustless. The SNARK technology is still advancing to overcome some obstacles.  Since ShadowCash uses tokens, it may be much simpler than other coins to slot SNARKS in in the future for an even greater level of anonymity.  SNARKS for example allow you to keep hidden the actual amount being sent as well, and they provide better anonymity. 
Another good thing about ShadowCash is that it has a much simpler to use wallet than other coins like Monero.  Monero are still working to develop user friendly GUI wallets.  Shadow has a pretty cool wallet and is the first HTML type wallet I believe.  They have encrypted messaging within the main wallet similar to bit-message.  Also they have an in wallet block explorer.  They have said they plan to launch a decentralized marketplace similar to Open Bazaar within the wallet soon as well.  If they can deliver on that, it would be a pretty amazing project.  It has not gotten much attention yet, but its gaining awareness.

Cheap is good for distribution because anybody can buy a large amount of SDC for cheap.  If it was truly bad distribution you would see similarities to a cornered market where the price is way higher than it should be.  Kind of like ripple, and also DRK/DASH.  Everyone knows duffield instamined the shit out of that when it was X-coin or whatever it was before he rebrainded.
The decentralized marketplace will be the downfall of sdc?  That doesn't make much sense especially considering this whole fiasco with btc-e happened because of Evolution exit scam from a centralized marketplace.  Shows there is a need for decentralization.

One day the government is going to call you a criminal. Then you won't feel like such a winner in your public sector job. You probably already are violating numerous laws every day and you don't even know it. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:52:54
No it does not, not sure what you are getting at tbh.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:57:23
You must mean the criminals in the NSA who are spying on us illegally and violating the 4th amendment.

Thanks PT, you rock!

Check out [ShadowCash](  They have an amazing GUI HTML wallet, with in-wallet encrypted messaging.  Also SPV, and Android wallets too.  They use ring sigs with anonymous tokens pegged to a bitcoin style blockchain.  This has many advantages over Monero and is not a copy and paste clone like other cryptonote coins.  They also are working on a decentralized marketplace within the official wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:08:41
This is a very dangerous precedent to be set.  If the coins are being tracked and tainted, then it is not good for the fungibility of Bitcoin currency.  This is why we need anonymous cryptocurrencies.
EDIT:  Everyone please check out [ShadowCash](  Most undervalued and best anonymous currency on the market.  Ring sigs are used on anonymous tokens pegged to a Bitcoin style blockchain with a 2-way peg.  [Transact Anonymously](

Mainstream is never going to use a command line wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:59:41
I'd be perfectly fine if all of the cowards who want to be tracked, traced, and regulated use Bitcoin, and the rest of us can use a real currency that is fungible and has the properties of a good money.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:47:38
You're right there is no fungibility at all in Bitcoin.  That is why they need to implement zerocash.
@_date: 2015-03-21 22:00:23
Fungibility is important.  The solution is to use anonymous currencies like ShadowCash unless Bitcoin wants to implement zerocash into the main protocol.
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:30:11
DRK has a vulnerability because of the centralized aspect of masternodes.  Yes its still semi-decentralized but they become targets by governments who want to protect us from terrorism and money laundering.  Please do a show about [ShadowCash]( its a much better solution with ring sigs built into anonymous tokens pegged to a bitcoin style blockchain.  They also have encrypted messaging in their official wallet.  Soon they will have a decentralized marketplace within their wallet too.
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:46:27
Its fungibility not fungability, and in Bitcoin's case it is not immutable, because it does not exist in the first place.  Fungibility won't exist in Bitcoin unless they implement zerocash or other anonymous system.
