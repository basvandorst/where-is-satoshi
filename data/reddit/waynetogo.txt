Have them cash it, it'll be an accounting/tax nightmare, especially after New Years with the new tax laws, you'll get dinged for converting to fiat.
The hassle of creating an account and verifying your identity to accept the bitcoin and sell at market price to transfer to your business account is not worth the hassle.

I signed up a while back, filled out the verification forms, took a selfie with the required info and nothing after a few weeks. Decided to login to check if I had any btc in there and it said I was unverified and need to fill out the form again. Thank goodness I didn't have anything in it and just closed the browser and stuck with bittrex and binance...

All these upvotes and no summary? Wonder if anyone really listened to it, but the summary is:
Trustee still has them (the bitcoin). There is a business (coinlab) claim against the clients funds  in the order of $75 million holding it up. Another $5million in deposit motgx gave to coinlab is holding it up. Motgx gave $5million to coinlab to get license for US and coinlab didn't get it and trustee trying to get coinlab's $5million back. The lawsuits are holding up the return.

All that moisture and water everywhere next to live computer parts. I guess it's profit over safety there...

But litecoin with coinbase, transfer to bittrex, sell for btc and transfer out. Still have to deal with coinbase but not the bitcoin withdraw problems.

Since yobit disabled btc withdraw/deposits they went ahead and credited everyone with bitcoin cash and it's been trading a bit.

Any ideas on how this will work if asia decided to go with bitcoin cash? Anyone on the Chinese forums reading how they are handling this? It seems like I'm reading about bitcoin cash from only one group planning to dump it and not the others planning to using it. You can't dump if there are no buyers/users.

Bittrex doesn't change BTC wallet address. When you copy and paste did the paste address change? There is a virus going around that changes the bitcoin address of people who copy and paste and doesn't check the pasted address.
