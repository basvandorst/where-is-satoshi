-.- 
Yes, and I am psychic and know the future. I knew exactly that within a span of only a few days, BTC will rise triple the amount. And I chose to wait on purpose.
Dude, think a little.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:46:42
Exactly. He was and is extremely ill equipped to handle any money, let alone try to invest hundreds of thousands. Especially in bitcoin.
If only I had that amount of money....
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:17:06
Yup, let's move on, it's a fake.
*walks away*
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:13:16
Rather than asking *IF* they will adopt it as payment option, ask *WHEN*. 
Psychologically you're suggesting to the store that they're behind the times and it's something they need to look up and look into.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:24:24
Thank you! My passphrase exists nowhere in the world and is pretty long. Hopefully I'm safe. I just wanted to check a new passphrase I thought up for a second wallet, and I don't know how to check. I never checked my first/original passphrase  since I don't know how to.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:26:35
True, but I am horrible at remembering phrases I tried to get from a key. I believe my passphrases are wholly unique and don't exist anywhere on or off the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:40:28
Nice piece! This reminds me to complete that piece I've been planning.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:46:06
I was simply thinking that an easier entry into the currency would make more people get into it and use it. Hence, BTC economy strengthens.
But. like you said, maybe not. BTC is so new that it's difficult to figure out what reactions will be caused by actions.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:22:27
Great! Could you please tag me in it, so I can see it? :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:08:59
Well then, I must have been very unlucky. But it was my case. It was horrible to see.
I kind of wish the site had a minimal bet faucet to play with, like primedice. Then I'd play there, cause I like their minesweeper game.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:40:51


You could, but the chances are astronomically against you. Even IF you get luckier than anyone on earth against any odds, combined, chances are you will happen across a wallet with an amount like 0.05 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:52:27
Holy hell, 37% O_o
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:50:43
Hah, I'd love to see your script, and try it. 
There is no chance of it generating the same address, but it'd be fun to see it try, haha
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:28:33
Your first problem is finding any place that would give you bitcoins for a large amount of credit. I have never heard of one.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:53:55
So... If I want to check my passphrase, how do I go about it?
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:13:03
Yes. While I didn't know his parents, it seems that his father didn't exactly give it a lot of thought. I feel very sorry for his sister, who got very much screwed over by this guy.
I am still hoping that this story is a fake.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:15:00
I'd love to see the script, and look it over
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:43:10
Clearly you have not researched bitcoin and what it's about, and don't know anything about trading.
First of all, stop trying to trade bitcoin!!l
Second, get help from a financial advisor. And NOT over the internet.
Yes, bitcoin has huge potential, but it's exactly what the word means: potential. Nothing guaranteed, and it can get completely destroyed to zero.
First rule of investing into volatile markets is: never invest more than you're willing to lose.
I'm sorry about your predicament, but you were clearnly not ready to handle the money. I wish you had thought of getting help with it.
You need to come clean about the money to your sister as well. Can't continue lying to her, especially not if she thinks there's more money than was left to you.
Bottom line right now is: GET HELP.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:11:07
They advise you against bitcoin because it is not advisable to do day trading like you did. Why? Exactly because of what happened. You panic sold. No financial advisor wants to be part of that. 
I can see why you think bitcoin will make you rich. But so far, it hasn't. 
Nobody will be willing to risk their name/company/reputation in trying to help you gain your money back on playing with bitcoin.
It's not as easy as "buy low, sell high".
Nobody has a crystal ball to see where bitcoin will be going 5 hours from now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:10:03
You are correct, despite what the current fiat is worth, you will always have the same amount of Bitcoin.
For example, I sold something for 0.045 BTC, which was worth 25 dollars at the time. Last I checked, it was worth 35 dollars. It's still 0.045 BTC sitting in my account, but it's worth more in fiat.
The real power of bitcoin lies in its ease of using, transferring, etc. but of course one can ride it as investment.
Tip: I'm sure you you've heard this before, but when/if the price plummets, DO NOT panic sell! Ride it out.
Welcome to the roller coaster! :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:04:46
Can't wait! :D
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:12:19
Only invest what you can afford to lose. Most important, do your own research and do not rely solely on internet strangers advice when it comes to your savings (if it's sum you would lose sleep over if lost).
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:01:58
People see get rich quick opportunity in bitcoin, and even though they have never traded or paid attention to any markets before, they get on board.
Then they see a bit of a dip and get scared that they'll lose their investment. They sell as fast as they can, panicking.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:26:56
Works just fine for me :3
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:05:35
I wish :( I'm just sitting here waiting for info verification, while all this beauty is happening around me :/
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:45:31
Would I have to buy Minecraft for this?
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:53:06
How do the hackers even know what to look for? Or when? I know mothing about it, but it would be very interesting to know how they think and in extension learn to pritect my stuff better.
Any explanations? Is there a way I can try/see this working?
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:25:14
Highly doubt it, since bitcoin is a currency, not a product.
It's similar to whether we can buy Euros cheaper on Black Friday. :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:40:47
At current rate, 0.01 btc is about 8 dollars :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:17:31
Came here to say this.
Businesses have no choice but to cash out bitcoin into fiat, since they cannot yet pay their operation costs with bitcoin yet. If they do this with bitpay, they don't "lose money".
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:18:48
150k, from around 750k. Damn. 
Listen. Day trading with bitcoin very very rarely works out. Because it's very volatile.
To me it slowly seems that you're not so much looking for advice, but trying to validate your decision of wanting to run with BTC day trading.
I am really sorry for what happened to you, but if you knew just a little bit about trading, you would have known not to panic sell.   
450k is a BIG amount of money. Face it, you squandered it.      
Running to reddit for help when you feel like you're in the shits won't garner you much sympathy.
I wish I could help you, I hate to see people in such situations. But neither I, nor anyone else here knows the future, or what bitcoin will do for certain, so you can make back your lost money. 
If we could all do that, then we'd all be busy with making money for ourselves the easy way.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:22:31
Ask not IF they accept Bitcoin, but WHEN.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:04:52
Yep, I have a tiny amount I gathered from faucets, want more! :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:09:39
I thought posting referral links was not allowed. Besides, it's not very nice for you to ask such a question trying to trick people into clicking your link.
Not cool at all.
If you post referral links, be up front about it, and only post where they're allowed.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:27:52
Past is past, can't change it. No need to get depressed over it, really.
Admit once to yourself that you could have gotten into it, then take this experience and use it in your future moments.
Get into bitcoin now. Set up a little payment into it every week, it'll add up.
Being "happy" when the price goes down a bit is pretty much only spiting yourself. Nobody else cares about (or knows about) how you feel in that regard.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:33:40
Nobody knows, sorry. :(
If we knew, we'd all be doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:03:34
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:56:58
I'd be interested in what you can say about primedice.com.
They have a free faucet to start your gambling from, 1% house edge.
Edit: their site may be down
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:10:37
Haha, I didn't google it :) But I know for certain :) 
I'm not sure I understand why it would be insecure if I thought it up?
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:06:50
I tried it, but I found that when I was betting 0 money, I could get to minimum the third line on the biggest layout, every single time, I counted, 500 times out of 500.
As soon as I bet the minimum amount, I was hitting bombs on first and second steps so often, that I gave up playing.
EDIT: Also just FYI - posting referral links is highly frowned upon in this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:12:22
I agree! Why isn't there a site that takes prepaid debit cards as payment for Bitcoin? I hate to share any bank account and so much personal info on the internet.
And once I do (did), it takes AGES to be verified and I can start buying.
I've been waiting for verification and transfer of money for over a week now, watching BTC climb from 220 dollars to 600. Not being able to do anything.
And please don't tell me about localbitcoins, I refuse to pay a 30-40-50 dollar upmark for "convenience".
I just wish there was an easier entry into BTC ownership. SO many more people would buy bitcoin if it was more easily accessible.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:50:53
Do you hear your own reasoning? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:37:06
How can you check if someone might be using the passphrase you are thinking of? I am now paranoid.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:05:36
First of all buy BTC.
Or, provide services or sell stuff for bitcoin.
Alternatively, you can slave away at a faucet for cents an hour. Or try your luck at any gambling site that has a faucet to start with.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:03:36
Ok, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:35:56
Thanks so much for the explanation! Based on what you described here, I am happy with my passphrase now :)
Had no idea that's how these hack things worked. Very insightful.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:22:57
How can I check that? I use Electrum for wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:45:22
Which faucets are you using?
Most of them either don't pay out less than a certain amount (usually 5000-7000 satoshis), or they pay out only once a week, like freebitco.in.
Also, you can have a wallet in blockchain.info, or electrum, no need to download the entire blocks anymore, if you don't want to.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:57:23
If you feel like you MUST invest in bitcoin, then buy 10k-20k worth of it, make sure it's VERY safe, then forget about it. Do NOT panic sell, like you've been doing. It's very stupid to do.
Don't look at the market, don't freak out over bullshit. 
Now, this money might increase, or get completely lost. Bitcoin, as you noticed, is VERY volatile, trying to play it when you're this incredibly inexperienced is foolish.
I rather see you find a good advisor...
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:23:16
Ah sorry, can't help you with bitvisitor. I went to their site once, but didn't do anything.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:12:29
Not many other options in Canada :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:56:33
The way you should format your question to them is not *IF* they will accept bitcoin, but "WHEN". Even "have you already?" is good.
Makes a huge difference psychologically. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:03:43
Thank you for the tip! Appreciate it :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:37:27
No need for  throwaway :/ I own a bit less than 0.01 (can't remember the exact amount, not gonna log into my wallet now :) )
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:39:09
Let the man himself say it. :D
I summon you, @_date: 2013-11-19 21:55:33
Awwh, thought the demo might be good enough. :( Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:13:52
Oh please make no mistake. I have absolutely no intention of buying his mom's jewelry, even if prices were lower.    
As someone who makes their own jewelry, I know *very well* what goes into making them.
I was merely offering an opinion, take it or leave it, no reason to get defensive. As for Etsy, there are plenty of other sites where people sell their handmade stuff, I was simply mentioning Etsy because it's the most recognized name.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:54:07
How do you do this? I'm so curious! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:10:44
Here you go :) @_date: 2013-11-20 20:43:11
I'm not so good at math, so how many blocks is the 0.20 BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:59:19
Thanks! :3
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:31:01
Makes a big difference :)
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:52:19
If you are a Doctor Who fan, I can sell you a pair of polymer clay handmade fish fingers and custard earrings :D
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:45:12
It has the potential to bring you such return, yes. However, you should try not to invest more in it than you can afford or are willing to lose. 
Keep in mind, Bitcoin is very volatile. It has the potential to lose everything you put into it as well.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:17:11
Congrats on that!
The only person who can make that call is yourself.
You should do your research and weigh the pros and cons.
If you pay off all your debt, you'll be debt free, but no bitcoins.
If you hold onto your bitcoins, you will stay in debt and then either gain more fiat worth of btc (they pay off debt+interest), or lose it all (stay in debt, no money, no btc).
It's anyone's guess what btc will do.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:07:52
Not that part. I mean the part about wanting to invest 150k more to quickly make up all or most you lost. On bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:44:38
40 BTC is still a lot, and has the potential to become even more. 
Past is past, you cannot change it. Look into the future now, with the knowledge you gained in the past.
EDIT: If you think 40 BTC is not a lot, comparatively, I have 0.11 BTC, and trying to get more by selling my crafts.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:01:06
Panic selling. OP is a pro.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:58:38
Invest what you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is still in its infancy and thus very volatile. I believe in it, and hoping to buy some as soon as my info clears.
Tip: If you do buy in and a crash happens, DO NOT PANIC SELL. Ride it out. It's the biggest roller coaster ride.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:04:40
This has got to be the 5th repost. Please stop.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:01:40
No offense at all to your mom, but the prices are insane. 
Anyone can find the same quality (and better) jewelries on Etsy (and if the seller is part of the BTC circle, then pay for it in BTC as well), for a LOT cheaper (25$ average).
Maybe your mom can do a sale discount for people who pay with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:36:49
Hmm, I believe I made a mistake. I did not see that the metal was pure silver. I assumed it was sterling silver.
If it's pure precious metal like that, then such price is justified.
My jewelries use simple sterling silver, since I cater to a whole different niche.
However, my opinion still stands on his mom possibly giving a small discount for buyers paying with bitcoin, if she wants to drive more BTC traffic there.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:11:08
How about keeping some, using some?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:13:04
I am definitely in bitcoin, and find it incredibly interesting to watch. Also, I am definitely a woman :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:33:07
There might be a lot of legit sellers on localbitcoins, but stories like this (plus my intense dislike towards any such website like craigslist, etc) just reinforces my opinion and resolve to never EVER trade through them or any other similar way.
I'm sorry for all the trouble you're going through. :(
