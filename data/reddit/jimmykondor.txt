Can I have some of what you're on? Actually. No.  I like my brain cells.
The world hasn't changed. The world is in a constant state of flux. Oil is still INSANELY profitable. Renewables have some significant hurdles to overcome. And guess what: we still need oil to make the products that produce "green" energy.

Lots of people here talking about stores of value (and Krugman himself).  Here's the truth of the matter.  The goods are their own stores of value (land, buildings, gold, silver, food, furniture, water, etc.).  All we need is something to show the RELATIVE value of each of these based on current market conditions.
The old paradigm of money is that the marker of value is the store.  That will not be true once we've moved to a truly digital currency.  The beauty of bitcoin (the blockchain really...) is that it allows you to mark WHATEVER YOU WANT as the value store.  With a little clever programming, you tie whatever you want in the physical world to the digital transaction in the ledger.  The network does it's thing to validate the transaction and BOOM! value store.
I know it's not really that simple - as the concept is only part of the equation - getting it adopted is the real challenge.
The problem is that we've always seen money as the STORE of value (gold/silver/copper coinage, gold/silver certificates) - since the gold standard was abolished that is no longer the case.  Money is (and always was) only a MARKER of value.  The value is in the goods that money is exchanged for.  The money is only a placeholder so that I can produce a good and not have to directly accept goods in return.
Once this paradigm shift takes hold - the old world economists will be left in the dust.
