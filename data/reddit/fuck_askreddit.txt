do you have any evidence of this
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:26:37
Yep! This is nothing new. It should pass shortly. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:35:01
WOW! That is amazing. That is almost a whole year of reddit gold. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:54:42
this sucks.
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:17:52
This truly is amazing! I am so happy for you. I wanted to invest early in, but considering I was in college, my "extra" money wasnt exactly expendable while still being caleld responsible. Go enjoy that house!
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:52:44
I agree completely. I wouldnt have sold at 260. I wouldnt have sold at 400. Unless it got up to 1000 a piece where I could guarantee enough for college and some extra money for my parents I'd rather stay in and use the currency.

I have purchased less than 1 BTC on mtgox before. You sometimes have to be carful however when entering because it doesnt always allow it.  You have to type  0.5 or whatever. I could be confusing it with another exchange. Basically if you want to buy - I recommend using a different exchange entirely (simply because mtgox already has so much or the market volume.)

I think he meant to say itll get to 200 by july. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:29:52
and now below $140
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:36:58
Okay.. lets not be crazy. USD is not dead. It is worth a lot! The only issue is that it is worth less and less over time. But you can still buy a hamburger with it, a car, a house, a person's labor. Bitcoin still has a long way to go until it will be acceptable to pay people in btc.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:58:16
yea... not cool.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:29:42
Why do you need to tax drugs? Im not saying you cant, but why do you need to? I think we are too accepting of adding on new taxes. Regulatory commitees should be funded if they are required, but I dont see why there needs to be a tax like with cigarettes or something. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:09:23
I am on the wrong end of the spectrum. I only have USD. :(

Who gave gold to a bitcoin billionaire's throwaway account???
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:25:47
It is still a currency.

45,000 ... nice. I guess I lost a few thousand. wow. I didnt think about it like that.

There should be a way to avoid this. 100% of my CC purchases have gone through without flaw. What if there was some system of escrow. You made a CC purchase (or paypal... whatever.) And then the funds were in escrow. The merchant sends you the funds to a mutally agreed non encrypted account where the transaction can be tracked. Then you have to click a "Verify Receipt of Coins" Once this is done there could be no refunds or charge backs. Is there any way this could be done? Or if using Paypal you have to have the funds availible. If using the credit card, the purchaser would be liable to return the bitcoins, not the merchant. I am a bit unsure how it all works but I know there is a better way.  I would be fine with a flat 3% fee.

On a private site, each user would have their own URL which would have to be encyrpted but privately assigned. You would access SR through this URL only with the associated account. Thus, any DDoS attack would be easily traceable and the URL could simply be deactivated. The actual host URL would be private, unknown, and inaccessible. This has a bunch of issues, one of which being implementation. Because SR is so large now, it would take massive amounts of computing to generate all of these URLs. It is much easier to start off by using a private design and sending out "invites" rather than now switching mid way. Any solution will take much thought and consideration. 
Note: I do not have a degree in computer science, and this is only my understanding after reading a few articles. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:45:21
okay - so Let me start out by saying that this seems awesome. I pay bills. I like bitcoin. GREAT!
Now let me show my ignorance. Why would I use this service? I can write a check and send it to the bank without worry of an issue with using fiat because I have fiat and my debtors accept fiat. So what do I have to gain by using this service and paying an additional (albeit very reasonable) 1% fee and additional sign up security risk?

He is actually a huge silver coin collector. But yes. Definitely.

wow. Thats 1.5 Reddit golds! That is amazing
@_date: 2013-10-21 09:11:17
I am excited for sure. But at the same time... I have been excited before. These things come and go and while I certianly hope bitcoin is here to stay, I am not going to get too excited over a fiat exchange rate.

I want to make a sex game or online strip club game and use "titcoins"

@_date: 2013-05-02 18:45:05
Actually the price rose while SR was down. None of the dealers were able to cash out and bitcoin purchases were still being processed (Price rise) Now SR is back up and is running decently. Many pulled their bitcoin out and others like me purchased items (all legal items of course.) Then the merchants pull the btc out to fiat and hence the price falls. I do not however attribute the sell off just to this. SR is still just a small portion of the total btc market, but it could be a contributing factor. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:59:26
Why is there such a huge difference in price from exchanging USD and exchanging CAD? I do not understand and I do not like it. I am stuck to using coinbase waiting 4 days for an order because its the only place with sub $5 fees.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:19:55
Now that you have made so much, why not go ahead and take out the $30,000 and just invest what you have made. (I would prefer you not do that since I also invest in bitcoin) but it would be smart. Then you are guaranteed not to lose and you will only lose a fraction of your total investment.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:28:33
Silly people who dont realize that the independent variable should be on the x-axis. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:02:29
No forced transactions. But just things I would buy anyway. Like the guys bitcoin grinder posted up the other day was pretty cool. I might buy that, I am just waiting for his metal ones first. And that.. er.. computer... maybe we could share?
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:14:31
why would a miner possibly do that?
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:34:15
Mtgox webpage right now: 


I know it isnt related, but it certainly does humble me.

What is up with a $20.00 wire transfer fee for adding money? 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:31:10
Ive asked this above but I will ask you too: It looks like you have you spend $15 - $20 to transfer USD to your wallet. How to you avoid these huge fees?
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:03:01
WOW. That is amazing.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:36:19
I like how they make it sound like this guy lost anything. The article should say, "I would gain thousands in bitcoin if I cashed out now" But sadly it misses the whole point of the bitcoin anyway. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:50:04
The best way to get rid of coins on SR? BUY BUY BUY and throw a huge party!
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:52:10
Eh.. holding is great. But I much prefer to SPEND! Get the btc economy moving!
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:43:28
I do not expect bitcoin to ever be a sizable portion of the worlds money supply. Especially not in the state it is currently in. One day however I do believe a crypto-currency will be strong and possibly in everyones "wallet". The issue is that bitcoin is having to lead the way. However - I said I do not believe it to be "sizable" that doesnt mean it wont be significant. I cant put dollar amounts on it, and I cant put a percentage of GDP or of the WMS. Nevertheless, I want the currency to succeed, and that is why I have bought in, and continued to buy in. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:20:18
And the other half of the time I get things I couldnt otherwise purchase on the internet! Sometimes.. Like this past week they even coincide with one another!! :) 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:57:47
Regulation is fine. As long as it is done in a representative way which benefits those it is made to protect. The issue is that it rarely happens that way. People can act out in mutual self interest, but in this case mt. gox made unfortunate choices. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:28:46
panic move.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:23:23
Yep! And it worked GREAT for a decade of mainstream internet. But now... they are trying to change course.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:52:30
This makes me so happy. All of those girls deserve what they get. For me, being a guy, I just wish I started dealing drugs a few months ago. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:48:51
I think an issue is that people do not see bitcoins as being the amount that they spent, but instead see them in terms of the price they could be. You are correct holding with upward market trends is tempting, but you have to see it as though you made that extra money for free, so spending it is only helping the rest of your money. The currency wont improve until we are able to get transactions for normal things. Exchanges currently play a disproportionate role. (which is to be expected for a while)
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:59:46
I might give it a try. I am a good looking guy but you understand that when guys post on subs like that it has a completely different connotation than when girls post up. Do you get any tippers?
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:29:55
They say low fees, but how to you put money in your account, if you only have USD
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:33:30
Like I said, how do I tip anon? Also - the bitcoin is over half owned by my father. I am just the middle man. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:51:07
It seems like someone in canada could buy and then sell for +$1 and then still turn a profit. I would do that. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:50:54
These service fees will never work. We have to have a simple solution that only charges a minimal fee. 10+% ... even 5% is too much.

I love how you just tipped the guy a dollar and you get downvoted. lol Good for you sir!
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:06:32
It could be. I hope it is. But remember to NEVER get carried away over price. That is not why we are here. I stuck with it at $50. I will stick with it $250. But even if it goes to $20 I still think btc is the start of something great.
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:52:07
It is exactly the same situation between copy cat exchanges. While more *is* better... it is only better as long as the attacks are not directed at the site. Currently SR is the only reliable site, but that could change. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:43:27
My father kept bringing up that bitcoin wasnt "real" and that it was just a scam to buy in to. I spoke to him a bit and ended up getting him to "give" me $200 to "do with as I wished." So I bought him 2 bitcoins. This was just a week or so ago and now I couldnt even buy 1 coin with that inital investment. Even though I trust the value will continue going up, I am going to pull out some to pay him back. Its the least I can do. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:47:54
The US debt really isnt a big deal since the GDP is so high. People recognize large amounts of US debts, but with the current economic system large debts are allowed to a nation with strong credit. People are making lots of money by loaning us debts. And USD is a fine way of paying them off. Until people refuse to accept USD as tender, the dollar is not dead.
