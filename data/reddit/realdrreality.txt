Haha no wonder he doesn’t understand bitcoin!

Freedom 2.0

I’m more than happy to have this clown remain a no-coiner.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:16:55
This guy chose the wrong sub for that mess
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:40:00
See you there brother
@_date: 2019-07-22 03:50:46
Another reason I love the Aria
@_date: 2019-07-19 16:17:52
Funny how I thought it was funny
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:31:56
Oh I agree ;)
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:30:30
Okay AOC just keep your hands off my Satoshis
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:34:54
I’d trade a bolivar for a Satoshi, so to me it’s already worth more
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:04:17
I have no plans of selling, only exchanging for goods and services.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:47:44
“If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry”  only response we need for this guy
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:41:19
What excites me about Bitcoin is the hashing power and security of the network. The computer network is extremely secure along with its limited supply. With the current actions of the fed, I’m looking for a place to park my money. I’ll choose the most secure network there is. It fits my needs more than ETH.
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:37:01
I can’t wait to become a citizen of such a place
@_date: 2019-07-08 13:42:44
Now that’s some sauce that’ll go well with my breakfast this morning ;) thanks
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:56:50
I’m doing that. this guy has been misleading people for years!
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:18:24
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:44:50
Bitcoin Forever!
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:06:11
Peter Schiffs live bitcoin challenge!!! Now Live on YouTube. Here we go boys!!!
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:40:37
Any run we get in the next coming months, and maybe the run that got us here could be pricing it in.
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:07:33
Rodger that!
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:30:49
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:40:24
Yeah we’re just hearing him ramble on. There’s a reason he doesn’t have guys calling in. This guy is full of shit. Where’s the debate???
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:57:37
She looks more like a Sith tbh
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:41:05
I look at BCH like every other altcoin. And like every other altcoin, They are all falling in respect to BTCs dominance.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:00:00
Good for you
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:02:58
A week in bitcoin feels like a quarter.
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:29:40
Maybe it’s also because their government debased the national currency 
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:41:04
Not really 
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:10:05
Do it 
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:15:38
“What is dead may never die”
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:16:21
I read this in Vin Diesel’s voice 
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:18:52
A bitcoin based economy is what we’re all hoping for. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:02:17
I’m over here still buying dips 
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:04:02
All hail mother block chain. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:17:10
Ethereum has not yet pledged fealty 
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:03:47
This is true. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:33:22
I never had a savings account until bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:52:15
Because for whatever reason, people love to decide what’s good for other people. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:08:41
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:47:09
Robert Kiyosaki said he owned 5 bitcoins in a recent interview. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:08:08
Governments are fighting back. I’m interested in seeing how this plays out in Zimbabwe where currency alternatives are needed. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:39:19
Awesome, thanks! 
@_date: 2019-11-12 15:12:16
Traded some boomer bucks for some digital scarcity ;)
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:33:13
I’m not sure if this counts. But the same cars that used to cost me 60k are costing me 90k now. That’s in a ten year spand 
@_date: 2018-10-01 20:10:20
You’re not the only one :) 
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:32:15
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:22:11
Buying at 3k was a lot easier than winning the lottery. But yeah good luck with that
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:57:21
Why quote this Rat?
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:47:57
Yes and I’ll have four times the amount I did last time we got that mark 
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:15:42
He said in an interview once that he owns 5. Just to see what happens. He’s hodling
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:39:42
His people speaking. It’s YUGE
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:39:19
But... but.. my words.. you don’t care? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 23:42:35
I don’t want explicit btc prints in my apartment because I’m paranoid but this I’d buy in a flash. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:34:19
I wanna be a rich boi! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:21:18
Bch is more like Cain. Rodger ver is bitcoin Judas 
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:37:09
Then moon? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:52:40
It was a miracle to get from pennies to $100 per coin. Why would that be easier than 10x now? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:54:44
We only live once. Just let people be.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:02:29
You literally said don’t compare them 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:15:01
Yeah right off the 836 heading into downtown would be sweet. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:54:28
Right or wrong I’m hodling on
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:07:54
Hodl on tight fellas! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:13:00
And bitcoin will rule over everything the light touches 
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:15:16
I lost you in your sea of words 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:28:29
It’ll be a lot sooner than that! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:30:00
Same here brother (hulk hogan voice) 
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:25:53
Its true, it will reach millions of dollars
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:35:44
Thanks for taking the time to respond. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:50:23
I consider this investing similar to buying gold. Digital assets are part this new world we live in. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:43:35
I really can’t stand when the main stream media mocks cab drivers, bar tenders and regular people for talking about bitcoin. It’s so condescending. Thanks for what you’re doing and you’re not alone on your mission! 
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:32:55
My black magic hublot looks pretty frickin sick. Just saying..
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:01:09
What’s your opinion on the Petro Yuan? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:52:02
I’m buying more at this price so I feel good about the amount I can scoop up. I’m counting the amount of coin I own. Lower prices allow me to buy more. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:04:16
This is cool
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:13:40
Orange for me
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:50:17
And now we’re wrong until we’re right. Good day sir 
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:56:07
Cheers my fellow Florida man
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:59:34
I want one because Batman had one 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:10:13
I’ll buy
@_date: 2018-04-18 10:30:33
Some people just think about price my little green friend 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:04:40
Til Jimbo Jones has been in bitcoin for 4 years and is probably a rich man. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:36:05
Well don’t turn back now. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:40:58
First time I’m hearing about it. And I think it’s awesome. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 02:04:43
The sminem is a legend like none other.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:12:52
Let’s hear some of that sound reasoning 
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:26:03
Thanks for the heads up. I won’t be using that service after hearing this. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:16:02
Ain’t nothing on the news but the blues. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:08:30
Bitcoin would overtake fiat in a day haha 
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:06:50
I guess he was able to keep his kneecaps 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:37:20
Lord I wish I was hanging around this forum back then. My optimistic nature would have payed off!
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:06:41
Godspeed friend 
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:05:33
I’ve told people I sold my holdings and got out because of the recent price drops. I’ve really been buying more.
