And yet it is entirely circumvented with a single fake utility bill.

So you want asset prices to deflate? When people talk about inflation being bad, they're basically never thinking of appreciating asset prices.

So long Bitcoin. Price is tanking, sell your Ponzi shares now!

Posting this at any time in the last two months would earn you a slew of downvotes.

You can't have pump and dump without the pump. Suckers look at a price and equate it with value.

They're all debt based because debt came before currency. The idea that something with "innate value" makes a good currency is preposterous, even if you could find such a thing.

I was very, very right at that moment, hence use of the word 'instantly' in jest, since only idiots think they can predict what will happen day to day.

It did and it will. It doesn't have to be 1929 to be a tulip level speculative bubble. Even those who expect to make money by speculating on Bitcoin don't have any coherent argument about what price it could forseeably stabilize at anytime in the near future. So it's just a pump and dump shark tank in the mean time.

Just wish I was the moron who figured a way to short BTC a week ago when I stated that was unequivocally the right move.

Thanks, I've cued it up to run right after I finish this documentary explaining The Elders of Zion.

Sometime in the last few hours it went south of that line. I take it you're now worried and I'll get all your upvotes for being so instantly right?

The idea that some currencies are based on "debt" and some aren't is hilarious.

It's a distinction without a difference. As you point out, it's not the "innate" value that makes the currency but "the faith of trading participants."

The name is problematic, sounds like a slur

If you bought at $1600 you probably wouldn't look at it so diplomatically. It has pump and dump written all over it, so it probably won't be too long before you reflect fondly upon the days at $800.
