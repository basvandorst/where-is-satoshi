Stores could implement the barcode scanners to update the prices automatically based on the market changes. Could be pretty cool. Not sure why the market changing so drastically is a good thing though. 


Could you elaborate on this more?

So you are suggesting that people donate, either dollars or BTC and we convert everything to BTC until we share the funds? 
So take that $30,000 and buy 34 BTC then hold onto them and hope they increase in value. I dunno, I guess for some reason the mining seems like it has more of a chance for big finds. Say we find a whole block of 25 BTC. I'm not sure how possible that is these days. Any insights?

With so many transactions happening on a daily basis, and the length and randomness of the codes, how viable is it to track and locate people based on Bitcoin wallets? Especially since a user can create a new wallet for each transaction. That seems to be where the real anonymity comes in.

Doesn't have a USB plug, so that's a downer, but still looks to be one of the best deals around. I could be completely wrong. I am very new to all of this.

Yeah I've perused that article. Such prices!! So I guess the question then becomes, how do the common people get into the BTC game? Is it a game or will this become an globally accepted form of currency?

Ooooh now that is fancy. Like like like. Then you give permission, and that brand new physical bitcoin arrives in the mail. haha

Thanks for clearing this up. So when I am looking through these cards on ebay and Amazon, what spec should I be checking to know the mh/s?
TIL that there is no such thing as a fast, cheap graphics card on the market right now.

*he says while he quietly buys up all the stock Amazon has to offer.*  haha ;)

For some reason I had yet to think of all the hassle free transactions this can bring about once the major sites start accepting BTC. My mind is joyous at the thought of using BTC to buy whatever thing I really don't need off of Amazon.
Well said sir! Bitcoin is here to stay.

That would be very convenient but I'm sure many of the people who like Bitcoin for its anonymity would be against that. Although if it was some sort of option in the wallet on who the personal information is sent to that could be nice.

Doesn't this defeat the whole purpose of having bitcoins then? I think when we see dollars and BTC as sort of the same thing, this takes away from what bitcoin is. Bitcoin, if I understand correctly, is made to be a solution to the problems that the current form of money and the way we exchange it creates. It uses the resources and technology we have to improve upon the current way we exchange compensation for goods and services. So the idea then, would be to only use bitcoins and not USD as a placeholder for them.

Ahh okay now it makes sense. Again this is all new so I thought the two were the same unit of measurement. THANKS!

Such a great description and beautiful point about the nature of this new currency. Thanks for sharing these thoughts. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:41:39
This is the math I used
1200Mh/s x 100 units = 120,000 Mh/s
1000Mh/s = 1 Gh/s so 120,000/1,000 = 120Gh/s
Now I have since learned that the card I talk about only has a speed of 30Mh/s so this is all irrelevant anyway haha. But is my conversion rate from Mh/s to Gh/s incorrect?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:25:53
Thank you for the correction. So how does the increase in hash rate affect the amount of BTC acquired by mining?
