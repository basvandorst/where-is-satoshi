Nope, the number of inputs (past received transactions) is what increases the size of the transaction which therefore increases fees. The number of addresses the inputs are from make no difference. So if you make a payment using 5 inputs from 1 address or use 5 inputs from 5 addresses your fees are the same.

Lawnmower sounds brilliant, is there an equivalent which is available in the UK or Europe?

Yes 100% agree with you. The community as a whole really could do with moving to mBTC and displaying prices in that more often.

It still is a fair amount, it's 1/26th of his wealth and he is one of the richest men in the world.

Good job I didn't take a maths degree then.

Me and my friend are from the UK and in early 2011 we really wanted to buy bitcoins, we tried everywhere online to buy some there just wasn't anywhere which was fairly easy available. In the end we gave up and regret that decision very much these days.

Here's what a profile looks like:  basically just lists all my cryptocurrency addresses so if I ever need to give them to someone I have a simple link I can remember or put in a forum signature.

So you have around 66ish BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:30:32
Thats not too bad, you looking to sell them?
