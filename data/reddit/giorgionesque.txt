Are you implying that Bitcoin is money?

To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Do you even live in the real world? I know what you're driving at...the evil bank! And its evil ATMs! Hur, dur, OK. But you can also readily get cash almost anywhere; stores will give you 'cash out' or change for cash you already hold, people buying stuff from you on eBay or whatever will sometimes give you cash, hell, set up a lemonade stand outside your house and you'll likely take in some cash.
What distinguishes these transactions from Bitcoin is that you can do none of this, or thousands of other things you can do with cash, with Bitcoin.
QED, bitch.

Yeah, I love my bank too. Why? Because without it, I wouldn't have been able to buy my first car or my first house, because when you're in your 20s, you don't have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, so you leverage the bank's resources to your personal gain. And then there's the other convenient services, now that I am older, like a credit card (which is a payment mechanism, not a loan facility as some people seem to believe...even Ray Dalio, although he indicates that other people see it as this, not himself personally) which works no matter where in the world I might be. And if I want to buy several rental properties, guess what? My bank is right there, providing me with access to capital which I would not otherwise have, so that I can leverage the bank's resources to my advantage.
These fools who think banks are evil should try to live their lives WITHOUT a bank. Then they will understand what evil really is - it looks and feels a lot like privation.

Calling everyone who doesn't see things your way 'idiots' is not a good way to win any argument. Consider for a moment that there may be more than one version of the truth. Also consider the possibility that it is you who might be the idiot and who might be horribly wrong. I'm not saying this is the case, what I am saying is that you should consider it. Things are rarely binary ( as in 'black or white').

To be fair, the clue is in what you've noted: false. IE fraud. Fraud is usually illegal.

 **I hope we can finally prove them wrong in the near future, because this is definitely getting under my skin now.** 
How's that going for you, then?

This guy knows it is a zero sum game, huh. Well that's precisely what's wrong with Bitcoin/crypto. It is a zero sum game which means for one to gain, another loses. In normal businesses, when a transaction takes place, value is exchanged. I pay a dollar, I get a loaf of bread. That sort of thing.

People who aren't old enough to have a credit card really shouldn't comment on how they work. Credit card purchases reflect immediately on plenty of cards, mine included. ANZ bank, New Zealand.

Dude, please, read a few economics books before embarrassing yourself further.

Surf on over to r/buttcoin plenty going on there. The I told you so has begun and man is it going to be epic.

These people are euphoric because it's a) funny and b) exactly what they expected would happen sooner or later. Everyone loves getting a bit gloaty and feeling awfully clever when they call it.
