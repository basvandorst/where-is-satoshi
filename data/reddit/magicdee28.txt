He is currently offering an apartment in seattle for a ridiculously cheap price (with pictures and everything) 
 Here is a link to ONE of the Ads for the apartment 
Below is the email he sent me in February 1st from david.brown
Hello, thank you for your inquiry,
First of all, sorry for the late reply (I had a terrible week at the job).
The apartment I own on 301 N 104th St ,Seattle, WA 98133 is available and ready to move in as we speak at a monthly rent of 600.00 for the entire property. A few things about myself, I'm 56 years old and I am inspecting offshore oil rigs. Oh, and you can call me David. Most of the time I am offshore, I return to Seattle a few times/year. If interested, please give me some details about you (age, job, lifestyle or whatever you think makes you a good tenant).  What else...? the neighborhood is very safe, behaved pets are allowed. The move in amount will be first month + one deposit.
I would need a few rental details as well, how long do you plan to rent the apartment, starting when?
I'm currently on an oil rig but I could plan my trip to Seattle so I can show you the apartment. I'm sure you will love it, no one lived there since I've taken the photos .
Best Regards,
I.A.D.C. Certified Engineer - David Brown
Hopefully some of this info helps- maybe you can get in contact again (tricking) and some how get the details you need to prosecute or get something back! Good luck!! (Ps- thanks for posting, this was how I figured out he was a scam, so you saved me at least!)
