How is Dash premined? At least the website claims that it is not.

I can second coincheck. You can deposit up to 50,000 Yen (over 500 USD) a day without any ID.

I wonder if there is some defense against this kind of attack

Yes it has Japanese subtitles when you stream it from Vimeo. However, when you download the video there are no subtitles at all.

What if I was carrying casascius physical coins?
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:42:16
I guess this means that the shares will just keep going down in price as the difficulty increases then. I kinda liked it the way it was before.
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:09:41
Gotcha, where I get confused is people keep referencing some other p2pool that isnt decentralized and saying not to use that. Are they just talking about a single node? If every miner connected to the same p2pool node that would negate the decentralization of the system, correct?
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:28:41
I am on the slush pool. Is there any reason I should switch to this (other than the zero fees)?. I honestly don't understand what p2pool is about. Would my payout suffer at all?
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:41:02
I am not in the U.S. and I can use bitcoin in the store and on other bundles. Just not this one for some reason.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:15:31
Yeah, I just noticed someone else mention that you had to first click the send text message button and only then the Google authenticator option appears. That did the trick for me.
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:23:08
Who is 'they'?
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:29:21
What a coincidence I just ordered from them earlier.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:30:52
Yeah, I was gonna donate, but then they asked for my info.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:00:54
Unfortunately, I can't sign up because my phone plan does not include text messaging...
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:28:18
Yeah, I was like wtf?
@_date: 2014-12-31 04:20:01
That's an interesting project, thanks for sharing. But I already have that functionality. I am looking for a way to use HD wallet xpubs to be able to have merchants on my site receive customer payments directly without any middle-men at all, including myself.
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:25:04
Oh, I see. The instructions said to make sure to have your seed written down before doing a firmware update so I thought it would be wiped.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:37:53
The specs and the price on this thing blew me away. If this thing cant ROI then what can.
Also, I am reminded of my 50 BTC purchase of a Jalapeno. Boy was that dumb.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:56:52
Also check out bittracks.com. I run that service.
@_date: 2014-08-26 06:35:08
I don't know if there is any truth to it, but what I read was that the mtgox "cold" wallet was just on another server. So it still required manual intervention with zero security benefits.
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:38:30
I see, thanks for the clarification. Basically if I am already running a bitcoin node (which I am) I may as well run my own p2pool node as well.
Have a beer on me. @_date: 2014-12-31 09:20:45
Yes, but a lot of HD wallets don't even appear to have the setting. The only one I am aware of is electrum and I am not even sure the setting still exists in electrum 2.0. Even if I ask my merchants to up their gap limit, it wouldn't be clear what to set it to and I would probably have to continuously monitor it. So I was wondering if there wasn't a better solution.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:27:08
I actually pitched this exact thing to a big printer company and was shot down :(
@_date: 2014-09-01 03:06:41
Couldnt they make more money by blackmailing the celebrities?
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:59:49
They require a minimum deposit of 10,000 Yen (about $100) and don't appear to have any ID verification process. I'm in Japan and just sent them 10,000 Yen to try it out, we'll see how it goes.
Their site is even worse than mtgox, I didn't think that was even possible.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:35:34
You too huh? Did you get shot down too? I got the whole Bitcoin would tarnish our brand response, although they did think it was a neat idea.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:35:27
"customers who have earned points with PointTown will be able to cash them out in bitcoin, merely needing a bitFlyer account to do so."
How about merely needing a bitcoin address?
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:24:38
Thanks, but I am looking to build something that doesn't require a third party service. Also, it looks like the wallet is generated by the API, I need something that allows me to specify my own wallet, or rather, a wallet for each merchant or product on my site. The wallet itself should be in the possession of each merchant who will only share an xpub with me.

Thanks for the tips. These look very helpful!
Here's $5 @_date: 2014-04-11 11:35:31
So far so good. My account was credited the very next day (unlike weeks or months with mt. gox), I purchased and withdrew some bitcoin (0.5% transaction fee). Despite transactions being handled manually, I received my Bitcoin almost immediately. The market depth is obviously not there yet, though.
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:07:01
Am also in Japan. Would love to get paid in Bitcoin. What service do you use to get JPY in your bank account?
@_date: 2015-05-17 22:09:03
Yes, I am also curious as to what they add to bitcoin that makes it acceptable under islam. Implying it is not on its own?
@_date: 2014-11-09 09:14:42
Yes, I made a successful purchase from them.
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:34:47
I was thinking about it, but I would like to nail down the music bit before moving on to other more complicated things.
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:45:54
Indeed, but what to do after you've created the monster?
@_date: 2015-05-02 12:19:30
I run bittracks.com. Its been around since 2011, but never really gained any traction. It was difficult getting artists on board.
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:19:12
Funny. That's the exact same argument I used to dismiss Bitcoin when I first heard of it. Look how far it has come. I think you just need some patience, these things take time.
@_date: 2016-01-26 10:29:43
Bitcoin Classic is rejected because the "creator" may have smoked weed? I don't get it. Anyone can change the block size limit to 2MB why would that depend on anyone's reputation?
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:23:30
If somebody did find a way to hack it, wouldnt they be incentivized to keep it secret? Maybe bitcoin is hacked and the whole mt gox debacle is just a cover for it!
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:39:12
A single developer's opinion can cause the price to drop like that? I doubt it. Was he even involved in Bitcoin Core? Wasn't he just the guy that made BitcoinJ? Why does his opinion have so much weight?
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:48:01
Seems to be limited. I contacted bitwig about enabling bitcoin payments (they use digital river) and they said it wasn't available on their platform, only on "SWReg", whatever that means.
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:05:05
There are a few somewhat known artists, like dual core and Alex Sheridan. At least those were the only artists I had heard of before they signed up.
When I contacted artists, most didnt respond, some were against bitcoin, others didnt want to deal with more than one site (i.e. they were all in on itunes or bandcamp), a few said they would do it but then didnt follow through. In the end I dont think I was able to get any artists signed up through cold calls like that. I even met some in person but nothing worked out.
One of the other big issues was a chicken and egg one. Many artists wanted to see numbers. Very little sales meant artists didnt want to bother signing up, which meant the site never got  the content it needed to gain any traction.
I spent a good chunk of money on advertising too. I could get people to the site, but it never had any impact on sales. I think it was just too early back then.
I think the bitcoin payments are great. So easy to get working and I depend on no one but the blockchain. I didnt have to sign up for any kind of account either, just build it.
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:22:36
Both my trezors no longer work. I cannot initiate a firmware update and am locked out. I set them up and left them alone barely ever using them. I would recommend against it.
Support said to record a video or something, what a PITA.

Video of his arrest: 
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:16:26
It's been years since I've used the currency exchange services, maybe things changed in that time because I never had to show any kind of id.

So, satoshi didnt pay a high enough transaction fee. The ironing is delicious.
@_date: 2015-08-28 06:19:49
Why does it feel like so much longer since I've seen prices that low? Also, maybe we shouldnt jinx it as we might see that price again. But I guess that would "actually be a good thing" TM.
@_date: 2015-08-01 01:19:55
In Japan they always cover up the face of the accused. I think it's a rule or a law or something.
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:53:10
So, if I opened up a brick and mortar Bitcoin-cash exchange I wouldn't need to collect identifying information on customers?
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:14:57
Really? I never had to show any kind of id.
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:36:14
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:24:59
Here is a non-paywalled source: 
They are accusing him of faking the US dollar and Bitcoin account holdings. It also says there is a strong possibility that at least some of the stolen Bitcoins did not actually exist. Furthermore, they suspect he transferred user's money to other accounts and are investigating bringing embezzlement charges against him.
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:00:30
Unfortunately, there is. Banks where I live have shitty services with shittier websites that are stuck in the nineties. Bitcoin companies products and user interfaces are modern and far easier to use. How I wish I could escape from my current bank.
@_date: 2015-07-01 10:01:18
Sounds similar to the argument against DRM.
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:26:22
They are pretty much irrelevant for Bitcoiners anyway since you can't use your Bitcoin deposits with their Mastercard anymore.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:26:38
I wanted to buy some games from the humble store but their bitcoin integration is still "temporarily disabled" weeks later :(
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:33:23
Thanks, it was unclear that site offers a download. The text seems to imply a streaming service. However, if the comment below is correct, 480p is not something I want to pay for and watch.
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:29:05
Will it be possible to purchase a DRM free downloadable copy with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-17 11:07:43
Oh, do you know of any sites you can easily deposit and withdraw to?
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:28:22
@_date: 2016-02-09 14:28:01
Does it help at all that when I saw this news I thought of you first? Seriously, though, you had to know that your business model had an expiry date.
@_date: 2012-11-10 09:05:40
Yeah, that is what I was looking at. They say png, but look like they were compressed with jpeg.
@_date: 2012-11-05 13:09:26
Someone designs a better bitcoin logo and then distributes it in jpeg?
@_date: 2012-07-19 21:46:48
Thanks for the feedback! The sparseness is intentional, it is meant to be usable on a smart phone as well. Track times were dropped for this reason as well. Maybe I'll have to rethink this decision.
Not sure skipping through track sections is useful... they are only like 30 second previews anyway.
Thanks for the compliment on Chaos Theory, that album was made by me many moons ago.
@_date: 2012-06-11 03:24:30
Can you tell me what browser/version you used?
@_date: 2012-10-30 06:27:08
Indeed. Not my album though, I made "Chaos Theory". The other albums are by other artists.
@_date: 2012-06-11 08:49:12
Thanks for bringing bitwig to my attention. It looks frickin' sweet.
@_date: 2012-03-29 08:46:37
No! I lost too much on that site. Don't tempt me again!
@_date: 2012-07-19 21:48:39
Glad to have contributed! I totally dig the games for bitcoins idea.
@_date: 2012-06-11 03:26:44
I was going for so simple that it needs no explanation, but obviously failed.
@_date: 2012-08-13 02:43:52
Hi, I responded to your question via e-mail, but for any others that might want to know, there is no file size limit. Artists can either provide me a download link to their material or I can provide an FTP account for them to upload to.
@_date: 2012-07-19 21:49:10
Too bad, but maybe if you check your inbox, you'll find a surprise ;)
@_date: 2012-02-01 15:52:42
I was pretty sure some of the people behind Mt.Gox had made an appearance on the Bitcoin show in the past.
@_date: 2012-11-22 12:41:41
I *love* the simplicity of your checkout process. Compare it Amazon's 5 step torture extravaganza. This is exactly why bitcoin is so freakin' awesome. Good luck.
@_date: 2012-10-30 15:50:49
I enjoyed that, thanks!
BTW, interested in listing any albums on 
@_date: 2012-02-01 11:59:33
"Nov 10 to Nov 11", is that Nov 2010 to Nov 2011 or Nov 10th to Nov 11th?
@_date: 2012-10-29 12:43:43
Well said.
@_date: 2012-10-29 12:53:49
I run  and although the site has very little in the way of content, I strongly believe something like it is the future of digital downloads. There is no sign up, you just send money, and you get your download. That is literally it, you can't get any lower friction than that. Artists are paid in real-time after a brief delay (6 confirmations). It has a very "selling music from the back of the van" kind of feel to it. Good luck!
@_date: 2012-11-10 09:06:05
The links say png, but the compression looks awful. Looks like someone saved to jpeg and then converted to png or something.
@_date: 2012-06-10 21:16:02
Yes, a new bitcoin address is generated each time you click the purchase button. The page you are seeing is a unique order/download/key page. Once payment is received to the address, the deactivated buttons are enabled and you can download.
I'll have to add a little explanation. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2012-12-23 14:37:29
This is a great idea. I just wonder if it would go against Google's terms and conditions. You would basically be cutting them out of their share. Also, many users would download the software thinking it was free and be presented with a payment screen, probably causing them to just uninstall the app.
@_date: 2012-06-10 21:02:38
Artists get 90%. The site takes 10% minus any transaction fees incurred when forwarding payments to artists.
There are a few reasons for the low price:
 * I want to encourage impulse buys
 * The prices are specified in BTC, so even if BTC suddenly spikes to $10 or more tomorrow, it will still be pretty cheap
 * The price listed is the minimum price, you can pay more if you like
With that said, obviously artists are free to set their own prices.
@_date: 2012-02-01 15:34:24
Here I thought they were making money hand over fist.
@_date: 2012-06-12 03:39:25
I was thinking of a few simple categories like NEW, TOP SELLING, maybe TOP RATED if I implement a rating system. I will probably also have to add filtering by genre, but I always had trouble categorizing my own music and don't really want to impose that on anyone else either. In any case, nothing is definite. We'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2012-08-22 11:35:46

* unlimited downloads
* multiple formats

I've relaunched bittracks.com with a totally new design and a second album by another artist.
Any other artists interested in publishing their albums, let me know.

This is pretty cool, but there doesnt seem to be a way to purchase more than one card at a time. I am travelling and dont have mobile data so cant purchase without wifi. Do most starbucks have free wifi?
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:58:37
That makes literally no sense. They are discriminating against funds deposited using a specific method??? Once it is in the account, what difference does it make?
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:48:14
Odd. To test it, I just made a purchase, successfully. Maybe this rule does not apply retroactively?
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:35:57
I dont get it, if it is "centrally managed", what do you need the blockchain for?
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:37:44
So, if I send my funds to another user, they won't be able to spend it either?
@_date: 2011-07-28 20:33:28
Yep. Selling original music, mostly as an experiment, here: 
The experiment mostly failed. But it was fun. lol.
I used to be on Amie street before it got shut down by Amazon.
@_date: 2011-07-28 20:40:50
Got into Bitcoin over a year ago. Back then it took only like a few hours of mining to get a 50 BTC payout. I thought it was a neat toy, but never thought it would get anywhere so I totally forgot about it until recently when the price exploded. After re-installing my computer, I actually kept meaning to re-download the client and start mining again just for fun, but never got around to it. My laziness didn't pay off that time. Oh well.
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:18:17
I agree. It is really revolutionary. All you need to do is make a website, there is no bureaucracy to deal with. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 13:38:22
Thanks for the tip. Never heard of these.
@_date: 2011-07-30 00:01:40
Working on this, and it should obviously be the reverse: the artist should get most of the proceeds.
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:52:36
Because bitcoin is cooler?
@_date: 2011-08-27 08:51:30
I don't actually know what I was hoping for, but yeah...
@_date: 2011-06-05 10:45:23
Oh cool. Thanks for the info! Yeah, I'm not anywhere near you... :(
@_date: 2011-06-17 11:54:39
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:53:30
Looks like only one or two so far... better than expected!
@_date: 2011-08-27 11:39:46
Those were my thoughts exactly, but when I logged in to mtgox the price was back to normal. I am disappoint.
@_date: 2011-08-27 23:55:51
Actually, I'm in Japan, I wonder if they decided to start showing me the prices in JPY. I am still seeing this, is no one seeing this on the mtgox login screen? The mtgox widget on my Android phone is giving me the same thing.
@_date: 2011-07-30 00:04:18
Your user name is epic Mr. Jizzmopper
@_date: 2011-07-28 13:45:02
Yeah, but at this rate I'm gonna run out of Bitcoins soon and nobody wants to buy my music...
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:43:06
Is there an easy way to do this other than having multiple computers? I mean, the bitcoin client doesn't let me work with multiple wallets at the same time... is the only way to actually manually swap wallets in and out?
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:17:15
Yes, but I am a nobody. Selling in BTC at this point has the side benefit of getting me some exposure I otherwise wouldn't have gotten.
@_date: 2011-06-04 09:49:20
Yeah, I am trying to get a little site together, but I wonder if anyone will buy anything with bitcoins going up they way they are...
@_date: 2011-06-17 14:49:22
Already done.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:00:11
I use mybitcoin.com, which has a merchant link creation page where you can setup a payment. Once the payment is made the user is redirected to a page that you specify. Right now, I generated the links manually once, but they have a php API to do it dynamically if you need to.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:12:55
Awesome idea! Grooveshark on bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-04 09:50:52

"We need to be clearer about what kind of money is going to serve us, and I think that must be money that's issued as a public utility and not issued for private profit."
I think that statement gets at the core of the issue, and the reason that I have so much hope for the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:37:12
Thanks! Yeah, still working on a new brand... I used to have one.... but I am trying to start fresh. I don't really believe in albums, and plan on adding tracks every now and then. For now, I guess the artist would just be bittracks.com.
@_date: 2011-06-04 09:48:21
I didn't realize Mt. Gox is in Japan. They don't seem to take Yen though...
Where'd you get that address anyway? Doesn't seem to be listed on their site. Looking at that address on Google street view, it seems they operate out of an apartment building.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:00:56
I just took the easy way out and used global obfuscated links. So, potentially one person could buy the music and publish the links and everyone would have access to the content for free. I don't really see much of a point in trying to secure it any further than that.
@_date: 2011-07-28 20:48:09
Nobody wants to give me a credit card because I am a dirty foreigner. And back home they didn't want to give me a credit card because at the time I was a dirt poor student with no job. But they did give me a $30,000 student loan... go figure. I didn't quite get it, to me it seemed they were handing out credit cards to anyone who would ask (and even those who didn't), and they rejected me! The girl who did the rejecting looked like she was straight out of high school too, that only added to the pain.

This is good to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:08:31
You can call it an experiment, yeah. After Amie Street went belly up, I honestly just gave up. Bitcoin arrived on the scene, and presented an opportunity, I doubt it will pan out, but it's worth a shot. What I really wanted (and what I had with Amie Street) was a dead simple, zero start up cost, pay as you go turn key system with a built in audience. Amie Street died and I was left with nothing. Also, no Paypal or most (all?) other such services are available to me, so Bitcoin and me are perfect for each other. Someone else mentioned bandcamp which does look quite promising.
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:29:24
Exactly, also, assuming your customers already have BTC, the "purchase barrier" or whatever it is called, is much much lower. I doubt anybody would have trusted their credit card number to my tiny little independent website. I am thinking of a future where an artist can put their bitcoin address as an mp3 tag and post their tracks to the piratebay and have people donate directly from their music player, or even have the music player automatically donate a tiny bit (with the amount as a configurable option) every time the track is played.

I am currently in talks with one other artist to get their stuff on my site. Right now the site is mostly manual and extremely primitive, with no notion of artists or albums, so there is quite a bit of work to do to get there.

Sometimes I wonder if Bitcoin will just end up like the dream of Desktop Linux, relegated to a niche and never really catch on in the mainstream.
However, maybe like Linux on the server, Bitcoin will flourish as the backed of payment systems, and although the masses won't be using Bitcoin directly, they can still derive some of its benefits that way.

"Bitcoin flourished as quantitative easing was expanded, soaring in value by more than 700pc in 2013. Now quantitative easing has ended Bitcoin has collapsed. The fledgling crypto-currency hasn’t been alone in retracing its central bank funded gains. All asset classes are now crumbling."
Interesting theory on the Bitcoin price drop. I haven't heard this one before and not sure what to make of it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:55:26
I think it would be difficult if not impossible for them to accept bitcoin. It would require getting each individual artist to accept it. Bandcamp works by having you pay artists via paypal directly. They take their cut by receiving payment for every 10th album or so.

Yeah, they could do that. And then like 5 artists would enable it and how would you even find them? They would have to build some kind of discovery just for bitcoin and I am sure they dont feel like doing that. Dont get me wrong, I totally wish they would do it, I just dont think its practical.

I live in Japan and there is not a peep about Bitcoin anywhere. Nada. I think I did see ONE short article posted here, but that's it. People here are very conservative and don't even use credit cards. Many brick and mortar stores don't even accept them. Cash is king. All online merchants do cash on delivery. The age distribution of the population doesn't help either.
The irony is that Japan has more to gain from Bitcoin (at least compared to Canada, where I'm originally from), because the banks here are absolutely dreadful. They close at 3 pm, ATMs at 6pm (or charge exorbitant after-hours fees). The online banking systems are atrocious, looking like a web page from the 90s with a lack of functionality to match. One of the reasons I love Bitcoin so much is it lets me avoid that crap and manage my money in the 21st century. If only somebody here accepted it for payment...

"This issue was not observed to affect any critical infrastructure, such as miners or exchanges, since they do not frequently restart their bitcoin software and use multiple nodes simultaneously."

"Bitcoin is not a fiat currency in that no government declares by fiat that it is legal tender for any particular use.  But it is fiat in the sense that it is created in the cybersphere out of nothing more than imagination, with no inherent value, unlike gold or silver coins, or currencies backed by precious metals."
This is where he lost me. By inherent value I suppose the author means the uses of precious metals for things other than as a store of value. In which case they are mostly worthless. Almost all of the value of precious metals comes from the fact that they are rare which make them a good store of value. Bitcoin uses pure math to create rarity and thus imbues the system with value, all without needing the crutch of what the author refers to as "inherent value". I think it is a good thing. Inherent value of physical things also used as stores of value is just a by-product of our physical world, so it is easy to see how people would conflate the two. People just can't seem to get over the "inherent value" issue and I think it has a lot to do with Bitcoin being intangible, but in my opinion that is exactly what makes it most appealing as a pure form of money.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:53:41
I dont buy the "you can always make pretty things out of gold" argument. The only reason people like to have gold jewelry is because gold has value and is seen as wealth. If the value of gold dropped nobody would want gold jewelry. The value of gold is just as much an "illusion" as bitcoin or the USD. Gold has even less actual inherent value than bitcoin since it doesnt come with its own payment system.

Thanks for the advice. All things that I have considered. I am not sure I am quite ready to expand outside of music though. I think it would be better to focus on one thing first and maybe expand later. For the record, bittracks.com actually predates CoinDL by quite a while, although at the beginning I only sold a single album on the site (my own). One interesting trend I am seeing is as the BTC price rises I am getting more and more inquiries from artists to add their music to the site, especially recently. The tough bit is the lack of sales, I am afraid the artists will be discouraged and just give up. It also leaves me with little ammunition to encourage new artists to sign up.

When you buy through bandcamp, you are paying directly to the artists paypal account, so you not only have to convince bandcamp, you will also have to convince each and every artist on bandcamp to accept bitcoin.

People lament that the dollar is no longer backed by gold. But what is gold "backed" by? The same exact thing that give the modern dollar and Bitcoin their value, the belief that it can be exchanged for something else now and in the foreseeable future.
Put another way, having a huge pile of gold and not being able to trade it for something is exactly as useless as having a huge pile of cash and not being able to trade it for something which is exactly as useless as having a huge pile of bits and not being able to trade it for something.
Being backed by gold gives you nothing, except maybe peace of mind if you happen to have more confidence in gold over the dollar to hold its value in the future. If that is the case, then just buy some gold.
@_date: 2013-08-25 21:34:25

I am suspicious of fiat currency myself, but I've been wondering, did it not have benefits? Could we have had the economic boom that we had in the past 40 years and all the industry and technology that came with it if we were still on the gold standard? I really don't know. Fiat currency may be an illusion, but if everyone has confidence in it, is it not beneficial? Or are the costs and risks of the bubble bursting too great? Maybe that is something we will yet find out.

Maybe his choice of "declared" was poor but, I understood this to mean exactly what you said, that it is "declared" to be the de facto standard because the government forces you to pay taxes in it.

It may well be that printing money is the best way to stimulate the economy but the potential for abuse overrides any possible benefit.

This argument makes no sense. By that logic, Adobe owns every work anyone has ever made with their software, but wait, they used 3rd party tools to compile and create that software, so the compiler software company owns Adobe's software and by extension every work that has ever been made with that software.

I honestly don't understand why everyone is getting all butt-hurt over BFL, didn't people know what they were getting into when they pre-ordered?
