How about mirrored foil so that the "bank note" shows you, the individual? 
That would be nice. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 13:59:55
A merchant account with Coinbase let's the customer pay with a credit card and simultaneously purchase bitcoin with can then be kept or converted to fiat. 
That might work for you. 
A possible drawback is that the process might confuse some people.

Hello. 
There are many options for this. 
If dealing with relatively small amounts, one can use a wallet on desktop and/or phone to hold/distribute. 
You can directly pay out to the participant to their phone or a paper wallet. 
I can offer recommendations if you are interested via PM. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:15:09
Totally agree with many of your points, especially the auto debit idea. 
I'm hoping that Circle will solve many of these issues (still waiting on that invite). 
BTW, Coinbase _does_ have email support. In the early days, it was very slow, but it's definitely improved, and some of the support people are really helpful.

This. 
That Bitcoin is more than its currency features. 
The ability to use the protocol to create a cryptographic (or mathematical based) trust between 2 or more people that don't know one another in an international agreement without an intermediary is potentially huge.

I've been pleasantly surprised to have gotten no flack so far in and ancap subs (among others). I was also surprised to see most of the tips completed/accepted. 
That said, I also tip for good info or comments in bitcoin subs. 
Edit: also, YouTube tips that are accepted and well received.

I had the same issues when I first leveled up. I was told (by Coinbase support) that it was a third party identity check service that was failing. It was probably 3 or more attempts (with several days between required) before it finally just worked... Luck.

I mention this below, but what if the private key was sealed with mirrored foil so that the image would be that of the holder? 
Would be more appropriate no? 
Or maybe the image of a crypto hero on the public key side, and the mirror seal on private key side? 
Either way, good work, nice designs. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:36:12

I consider the opening of markets which are underrepresented or unavailable across international lines to be a high value target, and in some cases a good argument for adoption. After all, I can advertise my products and services to the world, but the banks have held off the ability to sell to those markets for far too long.

Using Coinbase (which Google is already using in their currency conversion), they can allow a subscription payment. 
One can either pay monthly, or keep a balance far enough ahead that it is convenient, yet they are not leaving too much BTC in their account.

To tie known identities with bitcoin transactions. Imagine the tracing possibilities. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:30:22
This. 
Programmable money is the best path to get those who have only heard about Bitcoin from the media to really open their minds and think about the possibilities (in my recent experience).

Coinbase allows CC payments which are immediately converted to BTC and then processed to the merchant in either BTC or USD. 
Fees are 0% if the merchant doesn't convert to USD or for the 1st 1 million dollars that are converted to USD. 
My startup is going to be using coinbase as our sole payment processor.

Possibly have the bot reply to a post from banned account with an explanation that it's a banned account? 
That could provide the shaming necessary. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 23:59:00
I agree. 
I didn't see the bitcoin option until checkout, but, I did make a purchase with bitcoin. 
Awesome. 
Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:15:51
Maybe require account and use some level of data quality check (e.g. geospatial and network location match, history, etc.). Nothing's perfect, and they're already filtering noise.

Why did you focus in this instead of getting BIP 39 and Litecoin support for Android (if I understand correctly, these are already supported in your HTML5 and iOS versions)?
