Agree with this.  This is really the only way anyone could link your real life ID to your bitcoin address.  This the issue I've always had with taxing bitcoin.  
If I get paid in bitcoin, I should only be taxed for what I change into dollars, right?  
From what I understand the IRS would try and tax the income you made in Bitcoin, which begs the question what cost basis would they use?  When I made them or time of taxes?

I don't think you have the ability to generate a specific address (i.e. one with your name in the middle).  Otherwise I could duplicate any address I wanted...

None of that!  What we've got now is wife and girlfriend amateur stuff.  We're not actually a pr0n site, we just resell access for bitcoin.

I've been trying to think of how to verify that for people and I'm not quite sure how to besides getting some reviews on the site and oddly enough I can't do that until people use the site!  Its a vicious circle...
I'm open to ideas though, and I'm hoping that with the newsletter giveaway those individuals will leave some feedback.  
Do you have any suggestions?  Maybe links or announcements from the vendor sites?  
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:03:07
We started bitcoinpeepshow.com to remedy this problem too.  I don't want this stuff showing on my credit card and bank statements.
