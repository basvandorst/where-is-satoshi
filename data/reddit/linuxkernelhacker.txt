because they got their Wells Fargo US bank account severed, people who could no longer exit to fiat saw USDT as the next best thing, so they kept printing as much as they could, creating insane demand for BTC and every other crypto they desired to pump.
I bet they also have massive mining operation, and and insane amount of future contracts on which they'll hardly lose their bets since they can manipulate the strike price just by printing more USDT and controlling the supply/demand.

most likely miners with a large slice of the hashrate pie (say 10% is more than enough) looking to bump minimum  transactions fees up. 
they know they'll mine back a fixed daily percentage of the blocks (about 10% daily) and by forcing everyone to pay more they get their money back and profit nicely with the rewards and extra fees. small blocks are awesome for this economic attack as it's easier to put pressure on the fee market with such limited space.

I was just in germany for 5 days (attending 34c3, a lot of crypto people there) and find his hilarious after barely being able to use my credit card, they're still as backwards when it comes to accepting electronic money as 5 years ago on my last visit. 
Everything in Germany is so advanced but when it comes to money so many places are cash based only, there's no way in hell they will use Bitcoin with how complex, slown and expensive it is to use, let's not become delusional. 
on the other hand ive spent 2 weeks in norway and iceland and ive yet to see what their paper money looks like, these are cashless societies where criptocurrencies would be a more natural fit.

What part of Bitfinex printing USD to manipulate Bitcoin's Price (and every other coin they want) isn't clear?
People are selling in case they don't have any funds to back their tokens, if they don't have the funds, the entire price rising will be explained as a bubble, it'd be like Mt.Gox but way worse, a fraud in the billions.

that'll explain bitcoin going back below $800 before the madness in price growth started. We need to look at Bitcoin's price around september 2017, when Tether barely had $400M in the bank.
This past january, in the course of 7 days they printed $1.2 BILLION alone.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:39:44
and then we find out that Tether = Bitfinex.
Not only they print what people consider USD worth, they are also able to high speed trade on their own platform as they please.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:37:32
No, people looking to get out of Bitcoin's volatility were receiving all the USDT Bitfinex could print (Bitfinex = Tether), they might have been receiving a worthless token (if it's not backed by anything)
There was no way the Bitcoin price would go low if Bitfinex didn't want that.
They print $100M a day like nothing, look at the Omni ledger.
Just last week, in the course of 7 days they printed 1.2 billion.
Enough to keep the entire markets from collapsing, as long as people trust USDT (like people trust the US Dollar) they can keep the fallacy.
If they don't have the USD to back all that printed USDT, they're acting as the crypto federal reserve.

According to an ABC investigation, a subsidiary of a Florida firm collects taxes with an app and diverts them to regime accounts in Russia, China and other countries
Given the blockade imposed by the US on Chavismo's accounts in that country, as well as the sanctions imposed on the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) on January 29, a digital application called Jetman Pay collects aeronautical taxes, converts into bitcoins through digital wallets (wallets) and diverts them to accounts abroad.

guess you dont get it, it's a simple equation on how an expensive attack yields awesome profits.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:38:57
any pool controlling over 10% of the hashrate is incentivized to spam even if that means spending BTC, this pushes legitimate transactions to pay more fees, and if you get 10% of blocks with its 12.5 BTV rewards + the huge amount of BTC on the fees (averaging $50/tx with many over $100 a pop) of all those blocks you make your money back with a really good profit. 
This is what happens when you regulate something, in this instance, max blocksize, it's doing the total opposite to spam control, it's incentivizing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:13:54
you are starting to see it. they are controlling the market rate.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:25:07
no, because it's way more expensive to create scarcity. this is an economic problem, not a technical one. if blocks were 10x bigger, spammer miners would have to spend more than 10x the amount to create scarce space as there isn't yet enough bitcoin demand for such blocks, there's at most 4x if you aggregate other blockchain's transactions. E.g. bitcoin 300k + ethereum's 1M + 100k others
propagation is a non issue as it affects everyone equally. in fact there's less latency as the blocks get bigger. see Gavin's research on 20mb blocks years ago when the internet was slower.

@_date: 2017-12-26 02:49:25
that's not the reason why you spam. the reason why you spam is to make more money by pushing legitimate users to have a higher minimum fees. Pools with just over 10% hashpower are banking on fees thanks to limited blocksize and uncapped tx fees. Very easy attack. has nothing to do with BCH, all to do with easy money on the table. Blockspace has become a blackmarket miners are exploiting. Happens every time you regulate anything.

that it's not accepted by every website as a form of payment, because it cannot scale. If it's not a familiar currency every where in the internet it won't be adopted in the physical world, therefore it will always be a speculative asset for people looking to make an easy buck.

looks like you're doing heat exchange wrong :)
You want those miners blowing air to the outside as directly as possible. it seems there is quite a distance to the extractors.
You can build a heat exchsnge box next to the extractors on the wall and have the Miners blow the hot air into it, your miners will remain cool as long as the fresh side doesn't get any hit air bliwn around. Been there.
The way it's set up a lot of hot air is being recirculated and it seems your miners being so close to one another will overheat faster. be careful. Also do you have fire extinguishers?
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:16:00
I turned off mine (similar size operation), right now for the same cost of electricity you can buy 2x the bitcoins monthly that you'd mine.
in the US, with residential electricity (at 220v) it's profitable for around $7000+ per BTC, miners in the US are running at a loss unless they have very cheap kw/h.
If OP is in USA she's totally losing money and learning from lots of mistakes (she must be having huge issues with cooling and miners temperatures right now)

@_date: 2019-03-27 13:19:03
OP clearly has cooling issues, that's a lot of miners blowing very hot air into the room, you want nothing but cool air for the intake, op needs to make all miners blow directly outside or make a heated change area next to that wall where she has the extractors. No hot air back into the room. No amount of AC units will be able to cool that room with that many Bitcoin miners blowing hot air. If those are zcash miners perhaps it could work as is, those don't blow much heat.
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:23:44
you still need scalability and very low fees for that. meanwhile other coins are doing a much better job for payments. 
Bitcoin should continue its path as a settlement coin for institutional users with Liquid. If you take the time to learn what is happening outside of Bitcoin you will understand better, Bitcoin is seen as the old grandpa, 1st gen coin. Much more capable (faster, scalable, cheaper and dollar pegged) coins out there for currency use.

That company was doing several crypto acceptance experiments without any specialized hardware until now, it seems that in Venezuela crypto for retail does make a lot of sense, due to the crazy hyper-devaluation over there, also it's so much easier to send remittances over crypto than going through common (considered Illegal) channels (basically buying/selling USD in bank accounts abroad and having someone deposit fiat over there)  
in the article there's a demo of how the process is so much better than the BS QRCode process most wallet apps have. This works with a tap, they have an NFC card you can load with crypto, but they also have a wallet that's NFC enabled if your phone is NFC enabled. This is the future of cryptobased retail payments, happening where it's needed the most.

if you are in the US, it just doesn't make any sense to use Bitcoin to pay for anything.  
It's a hassle (buying it, sending it to your phone, paying for those fees, not to mention you have to keep the accounting of every spending event as it is a taxable event under the current IRS code, it's bonkers) when it's so easy to use credit cards everywhere, we already have electronic money, perhaps for a "small" subset of the population that's unbanked in the US it'd be a god send, but then again, the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin makes people want to HODL, not spend.
Once there's the infrastructure for a scalable stable coin to pay with, won't name any, that'll make more sense.
If you are not in the US and you live in a country with a central bank that keeps devaluating your fiat, by all means, ask for Bitcoin acceptance everywhere. it makes sense for you.
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:33:20
you need the hot air to go out, make holes in the wood panel right in front of the miners exhausts.
 you need a cold/air separation to do it properly,
you already have that back wooden wall,  specially if you will add more miners and want them to be taking cool air the whole time. Air should ideally go outside. Been there before, the costliest unforeseen expense was dealing with cooling, followed by sound proofing.
Doesn't make any sense blowing hot air back into the same closet.
I had hot air blowing into the same room, and even with an AC unit, multiple fans, air will always get hotter, and if the miners suck warm air they'll blow even hotter air, it's a vicious cycle.
All hot air must be blown outside.

easy, it's an append only (no "update table" operations), immutable, built with cryptographers with security as a core feature, all transactions are signed from address to address out of the box, may support smartcontracts and the representation of digitized assets, you don't have to trust partners in a federation that use it (trustless consensus), you don't want to build all of that on top of sql or no sql dbs which aren't meant for mass replication, the blockchain is just a different kind of db that has been designed for finance, that's why... and blockchain consensus mechanisms dont all have to be PoW and energy wasteful, a valid set of signatures by the partners can make the settlement of tens of thousands of tx per secs (or perhaps several orders of magnitude faster). Why reinvent the wheel on top of conventional general purposes dbs if blockchains exist.

what I think will work in terms of scale will be blockchain interoperability.
and sure they're not magical, but they can do a lot and will do a lot more simply by riding hardware and network improvements. Information technology only gets cheaper, faster and bigger every 18 months, you can't ignore that and artificially choke it with the excuse of centralization due to storage/processing costs, and then go and build an overly complex network that ends up creating centralization in the form of hubs. Too inconvenient, on-chain scaling and chain interoperability will make LN irrelevant.

kind of hard to support online shopping with LN in a decentralized fashion. OB sellers cant have their nodes up all the time, listings are stored on IPFS to offer offline listings. For a user to pay using the LN, not only it has to spend over $20 on on-chain fees to open a channel with a hub (fee from exchange to LN wallet + fee to open LN channel with hub), everybody has to be online at the same time to make the transaction happen.

you also need to think, that as more miners come in and there's less money for everyone daily, many of us chose to use our resources to mine other coins with more upside.
Also, many of us, already have our costs covered, and some of us may have less operating costs than others.
Some of us may have a big trading stash, not everyone is silly enough to just sell. A serious mining operation has a trading team, with positions in multiple exchanges, with bank accounts in multiple countries to make money risk free with arbitrage, and lately we can also offset risks with the futures market.

i think you dont know how LN actually works.
Opening a channel for a new BTC user, today, at about $4.90 avg on chain tx fee would cost $10 bucks, at best $4.90 if you can open directly from an exchange, on top of what you deposit in the channel. LN fees are also uncertain if they will remain so low in the future.
then imagine having a store online and only being able to sell if you are online at the same time as the customer, not a great business proposal to ebay/etsy sellers

Full nodes don't have a say, miners are the real full nodes (as described in the white paper), without miners, no blocks, no new bitcoins, no transfers, full nodes are simply backing up the blockchain, and it's the miners that say what happen next for full nodes to make any validations.

those wallets connect to servers, they arent online all the time forwarding transactions.
a phone's connection is very unreliable as it drops when moving from cell to cell, there might be bad coverage and it can also jump from wifi to wifi, or wifi to carrier. Maybe when 5G is here towards 2020.

so if you did crypto to crypto prior to new tax law...?
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:25:44
how about the simplest explanation, Bitcoin does not exist in a void, people are using all the other blockchains combined and the transaction levels ARE down. Look at daily transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:52:09
ha, im waiting for BTC at $2k. Anything past $1k was insane already last year, watch for tether printed the last 18 months and you will see why.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:34:32
on cointraffic though
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:41:00
it will be hard going past systemic issues like:
- being online all the time (unless you want to hand over your keys)
- finding optimum paths (and not going always through big hubs), since it's an NP complete problem and the network can be constantly shifting
- being able to cash in/out if fees get high again
- waiting periods to be able to use funds
It will be a solution for some cases, but not an overall scaling solution.
My money is on sidechains.

Reminder, OpenBazaar still supports BTC. Once fees go back below $1, then BTC will support OpenBazaar.
No need to bash on OB which has been a Bitcoin champion and big evangelizer of decentralized economies back when we didnt have people tell us what we could use Bitcoin for, back when we actually spent it.

Nobody can predict the market folks, if they did, they wouldn't talk about it and would simply make the money themselves.
Another charlatan.

0-conf transactions would be much faster. But RBF killed that.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:10:38
indeed, just turned 40 and I'm all of those.
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:43:55
actually quite the opposite, Peter Todd if I remember correctly killed 0-conf transactions (which would make LN unnecessary) when he brought Replace-by-Fee, a solution to a problem that only exists when you have limited block space, aka, he's a small blocker and most likely hopes that LN succeeds. But reality happens and you need to be critical if you want your way to actually work. Criticism isn't trolling, you're just too used to being trolled too much.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:04:39
exactly. Not needed when you have decent sized blocks and 0-conf transactions for smaller amounts (&lt;$6000). Small blocks and RBF killed all that.

This article was written by Angel DiMatteo, he's been writing for DiarioBitcoin since 2014, back then he lived in Venezuela and then thanks to cryptocurrencies he could leave the country to Colombia, he always says how he's living proof of how Bitcoin literally freed him.  
This article seems to be hitting home for readers at DiarioBitcoin, it's written from the perspective of an outsider and crypto enthusiast, he breaks down what you need to know about how things are with respect to the legal/regulatory situation, mining, most liquid and popular cryptos, merchant adoption, exchanges and how blockchain adoption outside Bitcoin is having an impact in the country.

how do these shitposts make it to the top?
2 idiots that have no clue what a currency is, why is this so relevant.

some people don't have bank accounts, can't open bank accounts, won't trust banks, can't afford banks, much less exchange accounts.
people that deal with cash a lot, service workers, strippers, prostitutes, drug dealers, illegal immigrants, tourists from abroad...

cost of employees running your ATM network, the fee paid to store/location, cost of getting a money transmitter license in some states, hardware cost, blockchain fees, banking fees, exchange fees, insurance, the cost of safely phisically moving the cash out of the atm (armored trucks), compliance costs, business operations (rent, bills)... yes, it's not cheap running these ATM networks.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:01:26
OP should take a good look at Ethereum's use, and Dev. community. don't be so cocky.
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:39:33
because people are selling their BTC earnings to buy alts that are too cheap in their view. You should read about the alts getting more trading volume and understand how they work. There's a lot more (evolved stuff) to crypto than Bitcoin.

reminds me of Gnutella
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:35:20
yes, lots of leveraged markets out there. also options and futures.
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:05:26
of course it would, OP has no clue about the power of market liquidity.  
This is the equivalent of a run on the bank, all of a sudden, the ONE utility Bitcoin has going for itself (market speculation) is gone, the price might feel some upwards pressure initially due to more offer than demand, but eventually the demand side would be gone. This would be suicide for BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:33:39
a shitload of empty blocks would be fairly easy, this would make the mempool run out of memory, let alone people pissed they never get confirmations. easy attack.

that'd be at least 67.5 million transactions, we all know what would happen and how long that would take with the current blocksize...
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:48:35
67.5 million LN channels would need to be opened on chain, keep up
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:37:32
for those like me that had no clue what "PUBG" is, it's some South Korean shooting video game called PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:33:25
i Highly doubt it, unless many years pass and you get another whole bunch of noobs to fall for it, by then blockchain 5.0 coins will be around and BTC may have lost the crown. BTC better evolve
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:08:54
and it would take weeks or months for all the 67.5 million transactions to go through...
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:50:39
yeah, not doable nowadays if they all wanted it. hopefully that would happen organically over time.

what are the findings of your review? are you talking about Bitcoin Unlimited?
