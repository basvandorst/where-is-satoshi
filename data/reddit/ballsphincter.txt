well those theories were proposed long before bitcoin existed.
and, I would say, they were correct until bitcoin existed.
no need to berate people for being right a few hundred years ago just because they were only right for 200 years instead of 209 years.

Isn't that the same year the US took the silver out of their coins?
Probably didn't want the huge burden on their mint from american silver bugs being lazy and using cambios instead of metals dealers.

So basically you're saying that bitcoin is successful in Venezuela because the Venezuelan government has not managed to impose AML/KYC on bitcoin users within its territory the way the US has.
What happens if they eventually succeed?

And damages arising from any judgement of default on that contract can be paid in cash.
Also, everything you've said is civil law, not criminal, so they can't get the cops involved (except of course if you don't show up to court when they sue you, so show up).  Worst case they drag you into court, you say "I surrender, here is the payment of damages in legal tender".

You know, this is the sort of mind-expanding gossip I really miss from the early days of bitcointalk.

Yeah the lame part is that because 95% of the work of running a darknet market is basically organizational+management crap, it does not actually attract the most technologically skilled people with deep crypto background.  And honestly, when the FBI is after you, successful OpSec actually requires that sort of background.  And you can't really "hire out" that task unless you'd enjoy getting extorted.
I predict that we are basically doomed to an endless string of new DNM becomes superpopular -&gt; noobs flock to it -&gt; gets busted due to OpSec fail.  Appears to oscillate with a period of about one year.  Forever.

Actually more likely answer is that the plaintext keys to $8 million on his laptop were just his personal hot wallet.  Probably killed himself to make sure that the ~10x larger cold wallet with a deadman's switch gets to his wife/kids/family/whatever.

Wow there is so much understand-fail here I cannot begin to fathom.


No, they're mining against their choice of coin.  Once the forking block is mined, they have to pick.  The work they hash on is based on the previous block.  Also, this time around, most (all?) of the proposals include a rule requiring a forking block at a certain height, so they have to choose **at** the forking block instead of the block after.  Technically the miner chooses the pool and the pool makes this choice, but it's the same result.


There is.  And it's actually 101 blocks.


They can't.  At best they can pay for the promise of being given those mined coins 16 hours later.  It's an IOU, not a transaction.

below has a great point, in the case of restaurants you generally order, eat, then pay, so you do actually incur a debt.  And if they refuse cash you can simply leave having committed no crime.

**Duh this is why you use _registered_ mail.**

@_date: 2017-07-08 07:21:02
Perhaps but that chain will never grow to be more than one block long because it will have a minority of the hashpower.  Even ancient versions of bitcoind will follow the hashpower-longest chain correctly, they don't need to know any of the stuff above to do that.
Note that the activation doesn't happen unless a substantial supermajority of the hashpower declares support for segwit2x.

This is actually a really good point.  Encourage them to call the police.
There's nothing illegal about them saying they accept only credit cards.  But if you eat first and they demand payment and then refuse legal tender they have no recourse from law enforcement.

It's not true.
The IRS is upset that only 800 people used this special form they want people to use.  It doesn't mean everybody else didn't pay their taxes, it just means they filed the wrong form when paying those taxes.

Read the IRS's complaint.  That's where they got the number 800 from.  At no point do they offer any evidence, or even allege in a coherent fashion,  that tax is being underpaid or underreported.  The only thing they can show is that there is a statistical likelihood that people aren't using their fancy new form.
The IRS is pissed off that people are paying their taxes without also doing the IRS's bookkeeping for them.
I am unsympathetic to their plight.
