\^ This, a million times.
Also these people: "Haha bitcoin is down 85% since its top! From 19k to 3k! It's obviously going to 0 now! I am definitely not buying and glad I never """"""""""""bought the hype""""""""" !"

Fuck KYC.
Fuck AML.
Fuck governments. Harassing me for my $1,000 purchase of bitcoins (and locking my account!) but rich drug lord laundering money in Switzerland? No problems!

Drug dealers laundering billions with major banks: OK, here's a small fine.
People buying $100 of bitcoin through an ATM: OMG FULL INVESTIGATION REEEEEE
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:48:22
I'll never understand why people accept to give their biometics to random companies like that. Are you people really that daft?
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:21:20
He's the first one to admit he got lucky lol
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:26:06
And other favors from other billionaires, yes.
Check the GE deal during the financial crisis for instance. Must be nice to be able to guarantee a 15% annual return because you "know" people.
Additionally, check out the scam that IPOs are.

People who find new drugs  are smart. People who discover new mathematical formulas are smart. Satoshi was smart. Being lucky in your investment (which BTW also include missing investing AAPL until very recently) isn't being smart.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:21:10
You can with insider trading.
Check the time he was under investigation by the SEC and the investigation "mysteriously" dropped off. It's nice to have high-placed friends, isn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:24:24
Warren Buffet isn't "smart." Warren Buffet got lucky with a couple of his investments. For every Buffet in the world, there are 1,000 equally a smart people who went broke due to bad or just even average luck

But but but muh death spiral!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-12-27 10:24:54


So do most people who have altcoins, are you saying these are not investments?


So if I go and buy beanies, is that an investment?
If I go and buy rose bulbs, is that an investment?
By your logic, if I go to the dollar store and buy something, it immediately becomes an investment.
And I have bitcoins fyi, and far more than you probably.
@_date: 2019-12-27 03:56:32
Bitcoin is NOT an investment however. That's like saying a lottery ticket is an investment.

@_date: 2019-09-22 00:09:55
It doesn't matter. Just because something happened before doesn't mean it will (or won't!) happen again.
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:51:22
Sure. Just go bankrupt and never pay it.
See: What trump did (for real estate not crypto but still)
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:57:18
If by "sell" you mean buy more, then yes, you are correct.
My average price on bitcoin i still $1,100.... Despite buying a ton at 6k,8k, 10k and even 12k.!
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:07:22
Tell that to investors of Bear Sterns, or even fucking General Electric.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:22:14
I don't...?
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:43:07
You are 100% correct.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:19:40
You are 14, use your money on things you will like, such as games, going out with friends, or even your education.
People like to say bitcoin is an investment, which is, but it's also extremely risky.
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:34:20
Go back to bashing bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:32:12
and then it jumsp to 100k and what do i do?
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:20:07
Bitcoin is NOT a currency. It can be used as a currency much like gold could be used as a currency but at its core, it is not a currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:41:43
I think (and this is a guess, like yours) that we have one last good push coming on the stocks. Thinking, 3,300-3,500. Then perhaps a 25-30% crash. Not worse than 2008 or even close to as bad as 2008. I think 2021-2022.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:01:57
Haha I have stocks in my pension plan through work. Not really my money though if you think about it!
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:33:17
Just look the S15 on.
And believe it or not, Bitcoins are not even 10% of my assets lulz. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:43:30
That is the winning strategy, long-term. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:33:14
I will let this comment of yours speak for itself:

So will I, buddy :D
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:24:16
Bitcoin going to $1M but in 2025 or so

Useless IF lightning network works. I personally don't believe in LTN so LTC might have a use.

I wish haha. I just am a guy who makes a low 6 figures salary and doesnt spend much. I dont really like or want t o buy anything. I dont have a car. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:15:56
Not what the whitepaper says at all though
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:03:01
This is 100% wrong.

Yep, that one.
"muh consershop!"

Closed my coinbase account over this. Fuck those people.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:13:23
I am doing $1,000CAD a month here, hoping I reach the magical number of my age in bitcoins one day.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:26:53
Bitcoin is the future and going to 100k but not in the immediate future.
I think sometimes in 2020-2021 a lot of bitcoin short sellers will get wiped out, and fast.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:41:01
Anecdotical story time!!!
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:02:46


No, I do not


I get what you'Re saying. You're not wrong. But government has been doing this since pretty much 2011. Why now? Why this specific year?
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:43:53
Sure. Back in the days, that's what people used.
The only thing is, gold is VERY impractical to use. Bitcoin isn't.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:21:49
im still adding to my BTC
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:36:54
Uh, no. My S9 paid itself the same week I got it lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:09:00
No problem, you are welcome.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:01:20
Fortunately I don't give a shit about what you call.
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:23:32
It's just gamling and guessing. Ignore everyone who tries to predict the future.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:22:17
This is unfortunately 100% correct. It's even worse with the ETFs that people on here seem to be in love with. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:29:23
Im long bitcoins and im long stocks too. Both serve different purposes.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:11:35
100% agreed with you.
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:19:02
Weird, when I zoom out, it's up 270%. Maybe you have eyesight problems?
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:23:39
Yes. Definitely when I had been buying bitcoins for over a year and it was STILL at $200. At this point, I thought this was it. Bitcoins were irrelevant. It would remain at $200 forever and just be a side experiment and I thought to myself it was time to move on.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:41:02
And if you had bought GE, you would have been down 15% ROI. Your point?
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:50:27

Have fun man. You have an entire life to invest, enjoy your youth while it lasts, because it doesn't

\&gt; we need to reverify you 
It happened to me once. 
Never again.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:32:10
Agreed with 100% of what you wrote except for one thing: bitcoin is not a stock.
Companies can (and will) emit new shares, at BELOW MARKET PRICE, to their friendies. Bitcoins can do that
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:23:01
It means why the fuck do you accept to get paid in USD? The government can just print as much as they want. In fact, they do exactly that and it's called inflation.
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:39:27
It wont replace the financial system but it's worth way more than what people give it credit for.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:19:44

Yes but this time le bitcoins is le dead!!!!!! XDXDXD KAPPA101
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:24:05
What do you mean, "exit?"
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:22:39
Stocks arent up 1,000% in the last 3 years neither
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:59:20
Sure buddy I'll see you at 20k.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:29:42
I heard the exact same thing in 2011. Here we are now. Fact is, you missed the longest bull market in history.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:02:07
I got banned from for pointing this out
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:25:04
How is my grammar broken?
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:49:32
Haha i have plenty in stocks too, dont worry
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:25:54
Nope. Bitcoins going to $1M eventually so why would I stop? This is something im giving to my kids.

Agreeds, I have bitcoin/ether but most of my money is in st ocks
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:17:41
Not. Early. Enough
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:43:04
\^ This is the correct answer ALSO in addition to that, nobody can make bitcoins. They can only be mined, and they are mined proportionally. I'm mining some as we speak.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:05:06
My exit strategy is when bitcoin hits $1,000,000
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:33:20
I have other accounts but I will not post with them for obvious reasons, the first one being that I have a significant amount of bitcoins.
I will conclude by saying that I bought a S9 soon after it came out and, back in the days, you could mine some blocks yourself with it, no need to join pools. I've been on reddit for 10+ years.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:01:04
Fuck off and go back to troll.
When bitcoin reach 100k, just remember this: you had a chance to buy at 3k. Write that on a banner in front of you.
