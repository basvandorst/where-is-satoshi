Understand that profiling would mean connecting online identities to real ones. And that would be a HUGE breach of privacy unless we are in a full on police state.
2nd, Once you ID a BTC'er, how do you get the Private Key? It is one thing to surprise one, it is another thing for them to know and then make adjustments. Once we know that we are being targeting, it is Brain Wallet of the like, time.
Bitcoin (or Cryptocurrencies) are the best we have regarding Government adversaries and our money. No question there, can't compare it to easily confiscatable things like: cash, precious metals, bank accounts, etc.

I think what Wikileaks is doing is pretty ethical and the American public seems to think so as well, even with Big media coming out against it. If the whistle blowing system worked, this wouldn't be a problem, but corruption does what it does.
Regardless of what we think, the system is going to correct itself.

No evidence of the murder charges. They were dropped. You think the Gmen just drop charges like that?

He was never tried on the murder charges. It appears it was to sway public opinion. Not a new technique mind you.
As I said, the murder charges were dropped and no one was killed. If you are concerned with death, again, look to the banks - they were already tried but not convicted (due to consumer confidence - if you believe that.) Look at invading countries (1 million deaths in Iraq for a false war) - let's be honest and say the system is a sham.

Well, sure would be a great way for the intelligence agencies to discredit BTC (even though they are the ones who did the crime.) What I mean with the former comment is to pay the "ransom" - who knows, maybe they have the GOX coins and can buy the rest, or just buy them all. Even if they did, no way of knowing if they get them off the market, but that is beside the point.

If the Whistle blowing system worked, I'd be all for it. But the only way to get this deep corruption out is going to be, minimally, exposing its criminality.

Thx for the answer. I thought nodes are often as minimal as one can get (to save on electricity). And in a sense, we don't exactly have a surplus of nodes. That will have to change in order for Rootstock to work? As contracts become more advanced and such, I wonder what will happen.

Gold coins have a very small markup generally. Maybe 5% - 10%, depending on how hard they are selling puts on the metal.

Good point. The gist of what I am saying is that just look at how people are using Bitcoin everywhere. Right now it is a store of value first. The online scene (both dark and not) is growing. But that can't be all of it.

@_date: 2015-12-15 17:22:46
Let me clear my point. I'm not saying I am for government intervention. I am generally against all government intervention. But what I was saying is that Safaricom excluded BitPesa from doing business when they hadn't done anything wrong, and they gave no reason why. This is similar to what is happening in Australia with banks and bitcoin businesses. 
I appreciate your well thought out response and I don't disagree with it in principal. I see your point, the government, perhaps helped them to get there and that is the very thing I mentioned to remedy things (Is there another way?). We have a tech that can truly help people. 
All I am asking for is for Bitpesa to be allowed to operate there as they are truly helping people. And when people are truly being helped, I'll bend my "Government stay out" rule. After all, we have to try to get them right as it doesn't seem they are going anywhere. 
And sure, we need to find a way to remove the continued problem of these monopolies, but in the meantime, in light of how much we can help people, why not have the State make up for some of the wrong it did in this case? I can't stay black and white with my State views here.
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:04:51
Do you really want to use that as a solution? Wouldn't it be better to approach the problem as slowly as possible?
I'm basically saying "I don't know" and your argument is "Well, we can undo a mistake with a soft fork." Sounds dangerous and I'm not sure it is true. And if true, look at the problems we already have reaching something. 
Guess, we need some heavy simulations here but regardless, we are going in the direction of increasing the block size. And before it happens, we are probably going to experience problems (that have already started), which will inch us closer to implementing the change(s). 
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:29:55
Ah, thanks for the clarification. So, in your opinion, can the Cascius coins hold their "markup" value in BTC? That is hard for me to grasp, considering that Bitcoin is going up exponentially (where as something like gold is much more docile.) thx. In a sense, we are talking about a markup on an exponential asset that is also exponential...

Man, we have come a long way in just the last year.
"The head of the Payment Systems Department at the National Bank of Ukraine Natalia Lapko has said that the regulator is carefully watching the intensive growth of digital currencies and does not rule out the possibility of integrating bitcoin into the Ukrainian financial system.
According to Ms Lapko, the National Bank has established close relations with the country's bitcoin community and is now assessing bitcoin-related experiences of regulators from all over the world to formulate relevant standards and keep up to date with the latest developments. She believes that implementation of the technology can be greatly beneficial for common citizens as they will get an opportunity to transact with more convenience and at lower costs.
Ukraine is one of the leading Eastern European countries in terms of bitcoin usage. Several bitcoin and blockchain events have been held in the country this year, with governmental officials taking part in them, and the Blockchain Incredible Party conference is coming soon."

And then we will hit that point where "Do you have any Satoshi's?" comes up. Think about this, if and when BTC hits $10,000 will many people you ever meet will have a few? As a store of wealth sure, but not an every day thing imo.

Well, unsure, but I guess if you are lucky enough to own a few Casascius it would be wise to hold on to them (unless they are all you got, then don't put all your eggs in one basket.) 
You bring up a very very good point, the collectable value to people, if BTC does become what we think it might, will be huge (for Casascius). It is akin to having the first guitar model, a stradivarius violin or the like. But, we are talking a money here and that complicates most analogies. 
My feeling/thought is that there is a minimum and maximum BTC price range that is optimum for Casascius coins. Too low, no go, too high - by by.

Well, he sort of made a good point though. When one looks at the sheer amount of laundering that took place through HSBC and Wachovia, the courts finding them complicit in the laundering of drug money,  not to mention 20,000 or so dead people, and then they are not prosecuted due to the courts worrying about financial stability falling from the ruling, what should we think?
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:29:35
When they say BTC is up 40% and the USD is up 9%, isn't that a deceptive statistic? Isn't the USD being measured against falling currencies and BTC measured against the USD? This is hard on the brain, but if BTC was measured against those same falling currencies, wouldn't the rise be much more than 40%?

I do see banning Cryptos as being a huge problem, especially if their acceptance and benefits start to be widely seen. So, I think it is difficult to see so far out.
But technically, if larger governments ban then (and smaller governments would probably pressured to follow) the price would crash and if the app stores ban the apps to trade them, what could people possibly do? Mom and Dad aren't going to jail break their phones.
One hell of a film brewing here but hopefully banks and governments continue to be terrible at what it is they do as it relates to money. That is what got Bitcoin here to begin with.

Well said. I wonder if Bitcoin is going to be too entwined with our existing system for governments to even consider bringing it down (making it illegal as it will threaten collapsing currencies.) If they can make gold illegal as they did in the 70's, don't put it past them to keep their control while their system collapses.

Of course. And I wonder how much longer we are able to do this? (At least with an app or the like).
Still, and I don't see stats (transactions from LBC are private) I would imagine a huge amount of those BTC are purchased for stores of value. Why would it be different in Russia? The dark market relative to the BTC market, I've heard (?), is a smaller percentage.

Could be a store of value (immensely so) in that case. A price of 1 million USD would give it a 15 trillion dollar cap (with 15 million coins or so). My zeros ok? 15 trillion for a huge financial disruptor is not a big deal (some day).

Actually, yes, it took just a little detective work.
Governments comments regarding Bitcoin put a bit of fear into businesses, this was posted in many places in the past. As with China the government wants no competition monetarily. 
Nothing here: 
Now, I'm not saying their are no businesses that accept Bitcoin in Russia, as that is not the case. But not many

I really doubt they are buying them in Russia on the street to then spend them online. These are holders.
The Chinese exchanges are another matter all together, that clearly is fake volume. P2P exchanges like Local Bitcoins can't be faked like that.

I would be really careful with statements in either direction. Bigger blocks can obviously foster more centralisation of mining. Smaller Blocks can centralise confirmations on the lightning network or whatever method they use. I think the segregated witness idea, so far, sounds like an interesting possibility and it is not a hard fork.

Sorry to hear Blythe. If only there were a Niche for you to go into before it is too late. You know, something that wasn't just blockchain, maybe something a bit more that no other big companies/banks were yet behind. Oh, it skips me, must be something...
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:02:16
Well, I think we can look at the larger banks (e.g. FED banks, ECB, etc.) differently than our local banks. I think the larger banks, if BTC starts to affect them we will see a huge battle. The smaller banks, that will happen just as a matter of convenience and we see that starting already.
What is going to happen if the private blockchains doesn't really do much (outside of saving a bit of money) for the banks? Then you will see a huge shift to BTC and that is where the big fun will truly begin. And the banks will be in a catch 22 (especially the before mentioned Central Banks.)

But if the government does come down on "anonymous" wallets in the future due to some BS thing, you can bet Coinbase will be there waiting to be one of the only "legal" wallets out there.

I wonder if it really is going to matter though. If they stall the block size increase, then we have the probability of the lightning network being implemented. If they don't stall things, we get a larger block size and eventually, the lightning network. It seems we arrive to a solution anyway. I do prefer keeping BTC core rather simple and building around it, but don't know what is truly best. I'll trust the experts.

The amount of money flowing into BTC though, is quite small, relative to the amount of money "leaving" China. It is very very small percentage.

Very well stated. If we break it down to $$$ markup and not a BTC markup, then we have to reconsider things.

As currencies start their inevitable collapse, you will see a flight into finite things, be they gold, silver or Cryptos. Most likely Bitcoin will top that list for quite a few years, even if something "better" comes along.
The very deep issue here is people are questioning money. Now they can ask the governments &amp; banks some good questions. Now they have a choice.
Watch how bitcoin gets attacked and tied to bad people, things, etc. They will try to Usurp it but will probably fail.

Japan is the perfect situation to try BTC in. That economy has just been stagnating and starting last year (or there abouts) Japan has been following the FED's/US' advice on QE. Yeah, print trillions of fake,nonbacked money to fix your problem, that is the answer! Now they can have a secure money that is limited in supply and actually can give people more buying power and help to extinguish government issued Shiat, I mean Fiat, or did I? It is an experiment worth taking...

If this next bull market starts in Bitcoin and it really starts running, I mean, bitcoin can double or triple in price and you know what is gonna happen?

You might want to check out the new blockchain.info app. I just installed it and it appears to link you "directly" with your account via a pairing that you do from your account (not the app). So, it technically is not the app that is sending money, though it appears so. Very nice work around.

And it appears that ending the war on drugs is near the top of the list of Corrupt things to stop, which further de-funds corruption. War is right next to that and coming in the cross-hairs (ironic, I know.) ;-)

It does work securely. The weakness was not in the client, it was clearly in the OS. Anyway, going forward, we need to move to a more secure and specialized OS to deal with money (in particular).

Barring an act of God (or government or tragic failure) it looks like we are in the S Curve rise. Where in the S-Curve is anyone's guess, but I'd say still fairly early on (being that we are still in what looks like the early stages). Each rise has been what, 10 times that of the initial price or so? The last two moves took us from app. 26 to 266, then from 120 or so to 1200, and now we are "stabilizing" at 800... too (Dun dun dun)...

The TOS are long and they can basically pick and choose who stays and who goes with apps dealing in this area.

Even if software is available, I don't see people tracking (or wanting to track) small daily transactions. The IRS should just apply the 14k yearly gift to purchases. In other words, if you are spending over 14k in bitcoin a year, then start tracking it. 
IF they start tracking it to the point of btc losing it's fungeability then you are going to see tumblers take over and then when Starbucks, etc. wants "traceable coins" (you ID with purchase) you will see the trade of bitcoins go underground. They really need to be human about this. This technology can make governments as we know them irrelevant in 10 years with all the blockchain is capable of.

This is the nature of fragile (centralized) systems - they break when pressure is applied. But people are anti-fragile. Take this "technology" and add the pressure of a failed war on people, I mean consciousness, I mean drugs, and you have a TORRENT of a problem on the horizon. 
They will not be able to disable these systems, and technologies like namecoin and other decentralized DNS systems are going to put this movement into overdrive.

Is the Fed “tapering”? Did the Fed really cut its bond purchases during the three month period November 2013 through January 2014? Apparently not if foreign holders of Treasuries are unloading them.
From November 2013 through January 2014 Belgium with a GDP of $480 billion purchased $141.2 billion of US Treasury bonds. Somehow Belgium came up with enough money to allocate during a 3-month period 29 percent of its annual GDP to the purchase of US Treasury bonds.

Argentina and quite a few other countries have inflation over 30% a year. Perhaps right now Bitcoin is for those countries. It is VERY difficult to get Bitcoin in those countries for obvious reasons. Listen to the Bitcoin Outpost podcast which comes from one of those S. American countries to hear it first hand. So, an inflation rate of 12% when one compares the demand (look at the overall price increase since inception) is for all purposes, deflation as the demand outstrips the supply.
Most sellers would love to change their 2%-4% fee to .5%. We will see continued adoption there - which is everywhere. A 5% profit is suddenly an 8% profit - across the board. Think about that and add it up.
BUT, will we see use? You seem to jump over Bitcoin as an asset, which is primarily it's role right now. My answer is yes we will see use, as government money everywhere seems to be headed for a catastrophe. Bitcoin is a huge statement for many people and don't underestimate how far memes will go, especially those that make change.

For those of you saying to just let it happen naturally when the demand is there, etc. First, I guess this petition is one of those early stages of deman ;-) and  I think you are overlooking something huge. As millions purchase items on Amazon they are going to see the BTC icon as a payment. This will open more and more people to BTC. "Legitimate" shoppers will think more legitimately about BTC. It is a bit of a self fulling prophecy. This could be HUGE for BTC.

As the other poster said, you are focusing on BTC as a payment system. You are missing so much more. In addition to it being a relatively deflationary currency (yes there is more coming but the demand is far outstripping the supply), there is the whole disruptive side to the technology. And that spans more than our event horizon will allow for. And then factor in the synergistic effect all of these things do together (i.e. - payment system, "stock like", deflationary currency, disruptive black swan, anti centralization, ownership ledger, programmable money, stateless, etc.)
There is the whole aspect of Bitcoin being an Anti-war currency as well. A bit deep to get into here, but understand, without endless money printing, you can't (easily) have a large war. And forget about a prolonged one.

And you have to love the "stable value" comment. Yeah, it is still 1 Euro but each year you can buy less with it. With bitcoin it buys more (so far). The comments from these guys from the past just lack any thought. They are like state sponsored propoganda... oh wait.

So, all the people holding those coins don't believe in BTC and want to sell? Naaaah, this is more about pulling coins off the exchange than selling them.
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:01:26
But you got a car, people aren't buying BTC cause they don't understand it at the most basic level. And, right now, they don't need it. It will take ease of use, like when AOL had all those CD's everywhere, to get BTC truly adopted. Business will force it to an extent on people imo, to save money. It will happen, just a matter of time.

Since most of what you are talking about is done in dollars primarily, I wouldn't worry.

This is actually pretty good news as it shows you "they" are not in control. To manipulate public opinion they actually have to manipulate public opinion.

The war on drugs has done and continues to do more damage to the very people it pretends to protect. Instead of looking at law as from God, you should look at what these laws have done to mankind. What Ross did (if indeed him) was create a market for a need, be it illegal in the States eyes or not. Speaking of which, did you hear how Wachovia and HSBC were busted for laundering drug money worth around 1/2 a billion and causing around 10-20k deaths? Sometimes you have to think for yourself and not follow laws.
The sooner and more peacefully the war on drugs ends, the better. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:30:50

Look at the timing of the arrest of Shrem the day before the NY hearings began. Clearly some good timing there. Look at the arrests in Florida. Those two guys were charged with Money Laundering when no crime even took place. And they were setup up (approached).
It looks like Bitcoin is pretty secure, but they will probably look to make things tough for a few to send messages to the many.

I am by far in btc, a tiny bit in LTC. I've dabble in the alts. 
True what you said about others saying "be friends", but you didn't answer the question, you just refuted it. Do you really think it is wise to have just one digital currency? Even though btc is decentralized, it is a central point of failure so to speak (if there are no other alts). These cryptos in the future will probably be able to communicate organically with one another. To just say it is btc or bust is extremely short sighted. The even horizon is just too short.

Well put. A bit like HSBC and Wachovia being fined 1 billion or whatever for laundering 500 billion of cartel money and being responsible for the deaths of 10k - 20k people as a direct result.

When is the finger going to actually be pointed at the real criminals? Families are having their "wealth" stolen at every turn. Banks are still printing billions in inflation monthly, the FED audit shows theft on a scale matched by the US' GDP. 
And we are calling BTC a tax haven? How about looking into the theft of our labor via an inflated money supply used to fun illegal wars, Genocide in Gaza, etc.

People mostly seem inherently good. But, for years, via a bought and sold media, we have been driven like a herd of cattle using fear into believing not to trust one another. Divide and steer.
Yes, there are bad people in the world, but I would point my finger at those that profit from creating instability in the middle east as a political strategy, kill 1 million Iraqis in the process, profit from it, etc. as the ones to keep an eye on.
We are on the road to no where if we are going to continue to be led by the least among us. Decentralizing and making transparent our society (and of course using our hearts) is our best chance.

For sure this is great news, as is the Ethereum, etc. news.
The problem I have, is if BTC is going to eventually see 5 digits and on, how can these platforms possibly keep up? For sure they will go up in value, but if Bitcoin is 10,000 in 2 or 3 years, I just don't see it being possible that these 2.0 tokens can move with it.

I can communicate what it is, how it is, where it is, etc. but it just beyond their event horizons. It spans into semi-disparate areas. I think it takes people with at least a sense of technical, financial and a heightened sense of intuition to put together the relatively complicated picture that is Bitcoin/Crypto. And then there are those that just "get it" or it "clicks" for but those are few and far between. And even when you do get it, it is still a difficult thing to English...

Well said, labeling something as a drug is a bit of a cop out. It trivializes the substance, as most everything we consume is a drug. Some are just stronger than others.

Not sure if this is sarcasm or not, but I'll play it like it is. The mining algorithm is something we wish the FED actually did, instead of just printing. Mining bitcoins, which is really not what it is happening, is more like a "release of the bitcoins" into circulation in a pre-determined way - namely, not 65 Billion of them a month, which is raping a peoples. But I digress, or do I?
ps - Bolding doesn't make anything more true. ;-)

IF there is a HF of BTC with Segwit, some will move to it and other won't. By definition there would be two Bitcoins. Will both be successful? If industry gets behind the segwit version, I would think so, but would they take that chance? Lots of money to be made...

They profited Billions and Billions and were fined less than the profits (just from the drug laundering of HSBC and Wachovia.) Sort of like - What message are you sending when you fine people .05 cents for speeding? Sort of the same thing... Like a car company who doesn't do a recall cause it is cheaper to pay out in a lawsuit, even though it kills people. And the before mentioned banks were responsible for app 19,000-20,000 deaths.

You are leaving a lot out. As long as the State and Corporate interests are in control of the alternative monies, there is no threat, as we are basically living under Fascism.
Interestingly, many of these corrupt individuals have been tied to child porn and molestation and generally they get away with it. I'm not sure regarding Liberty Reserve, but judging the government on past actions, I wouldn't trust what "they" said about closing down LR.
Related - HSBC and Wachovia laundered 100's of billions of dollars in drug money. They did so complicitly. They are responsible for the deaths of between 10k-20k people due to their laundering. No jail time was given and the courts said they didn't want to weaken the banking system by doing so. You see, there is not justice. So we are going around their corruption.

Well, this is just a step in the right direction. A few more steps will be full use of bitcoin on "dumb" phones. No offense to BitPesa but it would be even better for the people to have direct access, use, etc. to BTC. Why pay 3%, when you can pay less than one and have a money that appreciates in value? Bring wealth to the people in addition to remittances. 37coins seems to be doing this (Not affiliated with them.) - I suggest you look them up.

On a side note, do imagine if he had substantial wealth in BTC. What would the US Government do? Outside of him making a bad mistake with the private keys, I could see the US Government putting pressure on the banking system  (e.g. Wiki Leaks) to not take his coins but that is going to be game they probably can't win.

The answer to money. Money as we currently use it is NOT about exchange (the original point). It still creates haves and have nots. It creates war and though i love BTC and see it as anti war now, once it gets big, governments will still find a way. But for sure a step in the right direction.
If we are using bitcoin in 30 years or so, we would have failed as a civilization. We need equality in exchange, not "money" per say. But it is difficult to look outside of primitiveness when it is so prevalent.
It will be more about producing and exchanging mid term, not controlling like now. And people will look back at capitalism as just another primitive form of government, and the money that went with it.

I agree I can't see SW as a hard fork, realistically speaking. I was speaking idealistically. It would be a fork though, so there is nothing to say we can't have BTC1 as a store of value and BTC2 as the SW lightning network.
My point with SW as a soft fork, and I should have been more clear, was that if someone with money/power like e.g. banks, state actors, etc. can EASILY just buy mining power and never approve SW. 
Now, I think this is going to cause more problems for them though as another crypto will probably fill the void, though it pushes things out. LTC just doesn't have the hashing power imo to reliably to segwit when it comes to attacks and such.

If a few large Nation States make BTC illegal, that pretty much kills a lot of its uses. Not many people will want to take a chance. Making it illegal makes buying it really tough. Don't get me wrong, love BTC, I tell people about it fairly often, but I have not met a person who has yet to have already had some. It is still a baby.
That said, if they make it illegal then we will see other forms, like Dash, Monero, etc. surface. If we can keep the coins CPU friendly, then the network can be secured partly through users and partly through virus infected computers.
@_date: 2016-03-12 09:54:32

They really need to be careful here. If they push hard to get control of BTC's blockchain, there will be a huge exodus to anonymous currencies like Monero and more mixing type services will surface for BTC. All this big money moving into BTC, in a way, has me worried, but perhaps it is just another unknowing Trojan Horse. The scariest part is that most people are none the wiser regarding BTC, so they will take what there is.

Well, thanks for the detailed reply. To clarify, and I'm not being semantic, rather literal, I am not talking about perfection, just making things better, a great thing to always integrate with this type of technology as we are dealing with a growing amount of money. It is important. Honest truth, I didn't know what you meant, seriously. I was not trying to create division or the like here.
I don't deny your points about BTC being potentially better than what we have, I agree with what I know thus far. But in some situations I would like insurance with certain purchases via a CC. Regarding BTC, don't stop because she is better. Nothing to be really proud of with an old, mostly antiquated financial system that was never driven to innovate. Long live the monopoly they hoped. (I'm ecstatic with what BTC does and looking forward to BTC disintermediating as much as she can of the existing system.)
Regarding the greed comment. I can see your point, but I can also see the point of view that if BTC is not able to be regulated (some), it is going to be an incredibly bumpy road. I'm rather for staying free and independent but I am not sure they will "allow" that. I want BTC to free people, so, however that is achieved, let's go in that direction. I'm just not sure where that is tbh. 
No argument with pretty much all of what you said. I think the problem here was our differing opinion regarding the meaning of a few words. ;-)

Greece needs to reduce its capital controls. If people are limited with their withdrawals, how can they really sink much into BTC? They need living money, not saving/protecting money.
This is a first step but it is going to require Greeks to put aside some of the restricted money they have for BTC, Gold, etc.
Will be a LOL moment when Greeks (and others) no longer have to listen to governments and their capital controls as they/we have created our own money.
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:16:44
You know, as this downward economic spiral increases, and more comments like this are heard, BTC is just going to vacuum more of the existing paradigm up.
We talk about "Oh, if it takes just 1% of golds investors, etc." but what happens if the economic system slowly continues this decline? In that situation, if BTC is still receiving money, and it will, we are going to have a Bubble on our hands, the likes of which we haven't seen since the early days of BTC, think of going from .01 to $1 and more.

It will be nice to see BTC grow into a store of value and for us to have the choice of using State FIAT, which me thinks is not going to be going over well over the next few years.
People are going to start putting more money into assets, not necessarily spending, so what is the FED going to do then? More than 1 ounce of gold is illegal, BTC is limited or forbidden. These people are going to grasp at straws to get their collapse.

When bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, I would rethink that. Not saying there is not a use case for pay pal and CCs ( there is, assurance/insuarance for starters). But to go across any border, saving fees, etc., there most certainly is a difference.

Pay Pal has the money licenses. I really wonder when they will offer exchange like services. Perfect place for the masses to buy BTC.

Governments are in a catch 22 here. They need a way out from the abominable QE and 0% interest rates. There doesn't appear to be any. 
So, they might go to negative interest rates to force people to spend (talk about keeping consciousness low) but at the same time there is a more mature BTC and other cryptos. And if the Gmen want to be jerks about it, we have anonymous coins like Monero to boot. Government's days are numbers at least as we know them. Get some good seats for the show.

@_date: 2016-01-07 08:23:28
We were waiting for this disparity to happen and this is a GREAT sign. BTC often moved with indices but as this crisis really starts moving, there are going to be few places to turn and people are realizing that. 
Once BTC crosses $1,000 again, I think it will be the last time to get sub 1000 coins... for ever. And then it will be $10,000 but who know what that means as FIAT (government) money is losing it's meaning. And when you see big money move in, you will know it.

Have you spoken to many people about BTC? His comment is pretty spot on from my talks with MANY MANY people. Most people have no clue about BTC and yet continue to say why it is going to fail.
That said, there are still quite a few people who want it to succeed but will not buy in and take a chance. We are the rebels it seems, which is ironic considering the corruption in money.

I'm not talking and "every day" type of thing. I am talking the evolution past money. Money is exchange and right now it is more about power, have's and have nots, war, poverty, etc.
Moving past money as we know it:
It is not a question of "Can it happen?", it is a question of "When will it happen?". My guess is that we won't be using Bitcoin before it reaches the end of its emission curve in 2140, as money will not exist then. ;-)

Not sure and this is coming from a Bitcoin guy. The hard fork and segwit talk/problems are having an affect. ETH has liquidity where as the other alts - I don't really know much. 
If BTC does not move forward, others will come and BTC will lose market share as it currently is doing. This is more about the movement, rather than Bitcoin, so diversification as an insurance is not a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:34:22
For the average person, they don't look at "market cap" of a company. When the stock is $200, it is too much. 
So, when Bitcoin is more than the price of gold, for the average person, psychologically, that is something big.
(I don't disagree with you, just stating how it appears for most, even a lot of Bitcoin people - we just passed the price of gold - yeah, not the market capitalization.)

Fair enough about not needing to be replaced if something is old. But we are talking about technology that intersects money and that is a bit of a different animal. 
Here in Europe they chips on their cards, they still don't have that in the States? It seems as long as they are making money, why upgrade why innovate, etc? And now something comes along that is going to most likely (at some point), cause them to innovate or die (or perhaps integrate and drop costs). But a change is a coming. ;-)
Re Coinbase - Much easier to jump onto an existing network. There is nothing wrong with how Visa works for the consumer. I don't disagree. Sometimes I don't want to spend BTC, I want protection. The problem with Visa is for the retailers in large part, the costs do get passed on to the consumer though. Saving 3% or so across the board (maybe more as many costs are hidden over years of inneficiency) must be done imo.

Can you explain why theft isn't applicable (or something similar)? I understand they need a trial to prove that, but there appears to be no BTC withdrawals happening.
Come on, don't give me ToS. They don't have BTC to withdraw. Your answers are a bit like a lawyers answers tiptoeing around the truth. (I don't mean that offensively, they just appear skirting things.)

By the time Bitcoin is much above these current levels, I think both silver and gold will have broken out. I don't think the shorting of the paper markets will be a solution here shortly. About damn time. (See Gata.org for more there.)
That said, I can't see Gold being more than 10k or 20k or so in the next few years. Maybe Silver gets to where BTC is now in a few years. But Bitcoin, if governments start buying it, if the global money system starts to fail more... oh boy, I won't even bother saying where it might go. You all know...

@_date: 2016-06-03 20:30:18
You will be keeping an encrypted copy there. And that key doesn't go up there. As long as the Trezor is not compromised, your passwords would be as secure as that encryption (And in light of recent NSA dealings, that is always going to be a sore spot). Still a weird feeling I can see, as you really have to rely on that encryption, whether or not it is blockchain (open) or cloud (closed). 
And if on your desktop, you have to trust the security in the same way but at least you aren't handing it to them. Though when online, what is the difference?

Thanks for the answer. Would it not make sense though to just have the Trezor unlock the master PW for e.g. Keepass, and then for it to close after use...I mean I think that would at least stop the danger of a keylogger.

Absolutely DISGUSTING, but not shocking.
The Foreign Policy Journal reports:
The email identifies French President Nicholas Sarkozy as leading the attack on Libya with five specific purposes in mind: to obtain Libyan oil, ensure French influence in the region, increase Sarkozy’s reputation domestically, assert French military power, and to prevent Gaddafi’s influence in what is considered “Francophone Africa.”
Most astounding is the lengthy section delineating the huge threat that Gaddafi’s gold and silver reserves, estimated at “143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver,” posed to the French franc (CFA) circulating as a prime African currency.

Amazing, so they try to hide a 462 million dollar loss by not including a 10 billion dollar transaction?
Seriously, if someone doesn't go to prison over this (and they won't), do we need yet more proof? "People of the court, it is true what DB did but if they didn't lie, confidence in the banking system would be lower. So, they didn't have bad intent. Their intent was patriotic; therefor: we are increasing their credit line with more monopoly money."

Depending on the role Thiel and some other influential Bitcoin people will have (and their influence), this can actually be a springboard for Bitcoin.

Ah, I see. But the thing with those derivatives (as you are probably aware) is they are shady and extremely dangerous. And for a huge bank like DB to have that many of them, it really should be criminal. No one at the top should be so stupid (And I don't think they are, I think this is corrupt govt. complicity - probably to help "the Americans" at that time.)

I guess we need to see some stats regarding his predictions but it seems he's been right quite often (though not hitting tops yet imo).
MSM was pretty much behind Hillary even though they mentioned the emails, but didn't go into great detail that I've seen. To say this race was 50 50 is crazy. Really. Trump had like a 10% chance of winning according to many MSM outlets. MSM was behind Hillary as was Wall St. and Corporate America.

I agree - we need to see some stats. I'm sure someone has kept them. Though we have to be a bit flexible with timing. If he says Bitcoin rises to 700 on Thursday and it happens within a reasonable time, depending on prediction, we have to consider it. I'm weary on who does the stats.
It is not a 50/50 chance to predict Trump when he was overwhelmingly the underdog. Take some responsibility here.  That is not generalizing, talking about 2 candidates in general, that is generalizing, talking about the biggest upset in our presidential (recent) history (which one was bigger? Maybe there exists one). We need to look at these pollsters as polls greatly influence. Stg to consider.

Well, just think of the 330 or so million people in America. Imagine 5% of them regularly use Bitcoin. 16.5 million regular users. Our price right now is $780. Oh, we also have like 16 million Bitcoins right now I believe. 
Maybe we are averaging 250,000 transactions a day, that somewhat correlats to the price. Imagine increasing the number of transactions by 64. What will that do to the price? And I'm leaving out a lot of variables. 
And with other countries using Bitcoin, man, I think anything below 10,000 with a little more use than now to $100,000 as it really gets used (and is also fled to as a store of value) to $1,000,000 and this isn't even the shit hitting the fan. 
For comparisons sake, a market cap of 10,000,000,000,000 (trillion) is $625,000 per Bitcoin (with 16 million BTC in circulation). I don't think a 10 Trillion dollar market cap in a few short years is unreachable. (When one considers the global situation, banking systems, etc.) That is a move of 800 times up from current levels. That is small market cap financially speaking, think about that.
@_date: 2016-11-13 17:04:48
Last I heard he said when Bitcoin broke 680 or so, it would challenge 700 and hold eventually, then 1,000.
Honest truth, he is not saying 12,000 USD Bitcoin this coming year. That is a reflection of where the system will be though, as gold will be very high, silver more so, etc.

Because BTC has demand higher than Brazil's inflated currency.
Because Brazil can just keep printing it, not with BTC.
Bitcoins inflation rate is not really felt as the demand is essentially exceeding the supply. And you can be sure Brazils currency will never see a bubble in price (up or down) like BTC's has. It is the up that is consistent with BTC though. ;-)

This is more about convenience than difficulty.
It will be industry e.g., Amazon that pushes it on us as they have too much to benefit. With their very low current margins on profit they see the chance to really increase profits by removing what is essentially a middle man (3rd part) in the credit cards. Going from 3% profits to 5% is potentially huge.

The idea of BTC being gold and LTC Silver, was too simplistic. But to look deeper, LTC handling the transactions and being being more the back end, the store of value, the grandaddy, etc. makes sense.
Not even sure if we would want to do any major changes on LTC, after segwit and maybe a couple of others. As it's value grows, it becomes more resistant to change I think. (more value, so take less chances.)

It is interesting to think about the last halving as BTC was really an unknown in 2012 (relative to now anyway.) But Marcus makes a valid point. 
Further, miners appear to have to sell a lot of their coins to pay the bills. Now there will be half as many coins for sale and that means coins from "holders" and speculators will be weighed into the equation. I just don't see people selling into this new demand (due from the halving). We are going to have roughly 1800 less coins for sale a day. Not a lot, but that is 1/2 of all mined coins now. Surely it is going to affect things...
There are plenty of coins but there are an awful lot of people who are just buy and hold. The liquidity is really not that high.

Well, sure it pays to be ready, but I'm not sure we know if what is coming is going to be game over or just an adjustment. I hope the latter, and that the existing empires just fall away and die and not try a last hurrah.
If these banks really do crash and burn and we do have a few Bitcoin, we are gonna have to learn to share cause it is not going to be pretty. But, we need a bit more time (at least a block size increase, SG, etc.) before BTC is ready. The money masters still can float the ship a while longer is my bet, so we should be ok.

Notable quotes
His conclusion was succinct. “We were set up.”
WhenJeroen Dijsselbloem, the European Council President, tried to issue the communiqué without him, Varoufakis consulted Eurogroup clerks – could Dijsselbloem exclude a member state? The meeting was briefly halted. After a handful of calls, a lawyer turned to him and said, “Well, the Eurogroup does not exist in law, there is no treaty which has convened this group.”
 “So,” Varoufakis said, “What we have is a non-existent group that has the greatest power to determine the lives of Europeans. It’s not answerable to anyone, given it doesn’t exist in law; no minutes are kept; and it’s confidential. No citizen ever knows what is said within . . . These are decisions of almost life and death, and no member has to answer to anybody.”

People mostly have no idea about BTC. But for what it is thus far, it is showing to be a store of wealth. Once Lightning and all is up and running, the big boys jump on board and it starts to be used as a payment network. That is probably when the sparks start flying imo. And that will feed the store of value more. And then, she'll tell to friends, and she'll tell two friends, and so on, and so on, and so on...

You are missing the point. Companies, to move forward, always have to integrate tech at costs. So, you want BTC savings to be just for them? Doesn't seem reasonable. 
And if they start accepting BTC with no savings for the customer using it, why would I use BTC over a CC with protection, when there is nothing in it for me? I would sooner just do a bank transfer for free and instantaneously (e.g. here in Germany) than use my BTC. 
That said, I would want to help BTC out, there is that aspect for sure.
Also, if Amazon did issue a discount that would be a huge incentive to get BTC going. Seems that until we have a mom and pop interface/wallet, it is going to be slow. It would have to be transparent and in the background.
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:01:56
Wow, this is pretty amazing. I wonder if Paypal is still doing nothing here? Supposedly they have a wallet with BTC but if they were smart they would use their Money Licenses and do exactly the same AND SELL BTC. Become a type of exchange Paypal? Why are you sleeping (not that I want you succeeding per say). It is BTC I am concerned with. ;-)
@_date: 2015-09-10 08:15:41
Bitcoin is useful tech. It is disruptive for a reason.
Amazon's small margins will probably stay small. They will also have to compete with companies passing the savings of BTC on and that will happen. ;-)
Chargebacks and theft are such a problem in the CC industry that they even black out certain areas. BTC, in large part, can help to fix that problem.
You skip good points I make. The internet took time to take hold. 
My point is talking with you is not like communication. You can't see the basis of some arguments that are being spoken about by some pretty intelligent people. You refuse to even look in the middle.
Again, the internet was nothing at the start, just as BTC is (relatively speaking.)
Also understand, BTC will eventually be a store of value, a payment network is just one of it's things. Not depending on that. A store of value (inflation proof - predetermined amount) is another up and coming thing and we can thank the FED and Banks for that.
The Key to disruptive technologies is seeing them (Black Swans). You have been gifted, but I can only point... :-)
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:49:39
1. Companies do integrate tech at cost. They get new computers (e.g. tablets for orders, etc.). It is unreasonable how you are all or nothing.
2. There is not a 3% cost of integration of BTC. What are you talking about. Have you heard the examples of how Overstock did it cheaply?
3. They will want to use BTC to stop chargebacks for example. 
4. What are you talking about? My own comment, from your limited perspective shows you what you want it to show you. The wallet will probably be within the next year. They have come a very very long way. 
Anyone ever tell you, you pick and choose in your argumentation?

@_date: 2015-09-10 19:13:33


I think by removing chargebacks (at least as we know them). And more importantly by lowering fees. Maybe they meet us in the middle, we both save 1.5%


Would love to see pics.


If governments get control of BTC then sure. But if that happens, then anonymous money like Monero might help. We are in the early early days. I really don't think we know what crypto's are and certainly not what they will become. The application of money alone is a doozy.


The analogy perhaps is lost if you make time linear. As I said, this is disruptive stuff and some incredibly intelligent people disagree with you.
And price going up is a form of success, though not the primary one. BTC's usability has changed tremendously. We have light wallets now! We have easy security (relatively speaking). I had a class of people sending BTC's to eachother with no experience. The tech is close but people are ok with CC's, retailers are not and that is one reason why close to a Billion is being invested in infrastructure this year. The calm before the storm.


I think the main reason for the slide is that those Bots took BTC up way too fast. That and the coins he lost caused him (Mark) to become a fractional reserve lender. Also, we have not been down this road before. This is a pretty incredible time. We have countries near bankruptcy (or technically there actually), banks crashing still, QE going like no tomorrow, etc. and at the same time we have BTC. Not the answer mind you, but a step in the right direction. I'm surprised you can't see any light here. We have hope.


Keep believing true believer but the simple fact is that bitcoin is tiny (in the grand scheme of things), has not changed much in 6 years and when it tries WW3 erupts amongst the userbase and it's uncontrolled nature makes it something most companies would not want to touch
You are talking about a Money (at least the BTC app on the blockchain) that no government has really attacked, when they (US) took down any "private" money due to centralization. How could you miss all the positives. You want something "now" and "now" is a period of time with BTC (or any cryptos). IT is in the infancy. It is not going away, at least it doesn't look like it. And BTC doesn't need to be used by everyone. If it helps Mexican Americans and other immagrants send home money while not paying crazy fees, then that is a huge success. Remittance is full of charge criminals for the poor.
It saved Wikileaks. I think that is more than a dent in the side of the American government. I don't understand how you miss the obvious.
BTC is super tiny. A 3 billion dollar market cap in finance is nothing. I know that. But it was 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas less than 6 years ago. Now 230, not bad, not bad at all.
We will see. Best to you. Just keep your mind open for new things is all I can say. Not saying you are wrong and I am right, no one can really know. So be careful of those who say they know...
ps - Thanks for inspiring to learn the quote function! :-)

It is good news that Paypal will accept Bitcoin. But, if they are charging their crazy fees, it really makes little sense for people to adopt it without an equivalent merchant discount. We are back to credit cards and then the brunt of risk goes from the retailer (CC chargebacks) to the consumer.
Amazon needs to start accepting BTC for a 2-3% across the board discount. 
End game, so to speak, would be if Pay Pal starts using the money licenses to allow purchasing of BTC through them. Well, that and merchant acceptance, etc.

It was only technically the most advanced when it was the only one. Even LTC did some things better. Being "better" or "best" clearly isn't the goal, or rather can't be as other alts will always bring new things to the table. We need testing, stability, simplicity, etc. Without the Hash Rate being up there, I just don't see a competitor taking hold, especially when it appears as though Wall St. and such may have a say.
I wouldn't mind things moving along, but at the same time, Satoshi's vision is right on track.

Well, if they don't give a savings, we will see what the acceptance rate is. The point is a bit like how Paypal got traction. I kept seeing that paypal thing and eventually tried it. Having that "free advertising" in "We accept BTC at Amazon" would be great, of course.
But, pass the savings along. If Amazon is paying a 2-3% premium for CC use, why not pass that on?

No, you didn't read what I wrote. They gave her a bad exchange rate as they always do. My bad not to have suggested Transferwise at first, just slipped me. They took out around $250 extra. "Normal" business, "normal" being a mathematical statistic, not meaning "good".

To a point no doubt. Think of it like this, would you rather have 3BTC at 10,000 USD or 1 BTC in a 2013 Silver Casascius? I can't imagine the later having 20,000 in worth for just the collectability. Maybe, but  that is hard to believe. Selling the physical coin now for BTC in a paper wallet, might make the most (financial) sense, not to mention if BTC has a lot of use in the future, practical use. Banking system does not look good...

I use Purse.io but I am in Germany. Amazon.de stopped allowing it and now only Amazon.co.uk is the only source for me. Sometimes it is cheaper to just by from .de with no discount, considering the Euro Pound conversion and shipping.
@_date: 2015-09-05 07:59:03
I think the thing we have to ask ourselves, if holding some of these coins is: If BTC goes to 10,000 per coin, Are we still going to get 4 or 5 BTC for one? I just have a problem believing that. So, if I had any, I  think current prices and lower would be the ideal selling spot to get more valuable BTC in return.

And, it raises awareness on the corrupt banking system. So when they strike back against BTC, we now have more people on our side.

Well, judging by the numbers, the technology is lacking. It is essentially your credit cards on your I-Phone, not much more outside of that convenience. We need some form of 2FA on cards in General. BTC will probably take some time here but once the apps come out, it should be ok for retail. At this point I see it as a store of value (longer term), speculation, diehards, a statement to the corrupt banking system and governments, etc.

"Can it be scaled?", really?  I ask you, honestly, how can you argue about BoE adopting BTC (right now) when that is far off (if ever)? And on top of that talk about the TPS, which we all know is way too low. Look, this can be changed, that is clear. So, why even present that argument?

Well, Dimon knows a thing or two about State Level corruption, so perhaps he has some inside info.
But until that day where BTC is made illegal (which I doubt comes), it is going to put tremendous pressure on a corrupted and broken financial (not to mention political) system. And perhaps they make it illegal as a currency but not as an asset, good luck with that as well.
And it is going to be fun, watching good money push bad money out, even though it may cost Dimon his joke.

Really sorry to say that this whole thing has been set in motion, many many years ago. Governments don't even need false flag attacks anymore. I mean they have guaranteed future terrorist attacks by bombing the hell out of the middle east. Just a sad situation. Yeah, it is more complicated than that, but many question every aspect of what has led up to this mess.
I don't think they will make BTC illegal but I can see them making any anonymous features illegal.
Right now, we need divine intervention.
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:18:45
I tend to agree. But they will attack this aspect and when that doesn't work they will connect it to terrorism. Oh wait, they already...
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:36:02
I do hope governments allow these Crypto's for a bit longer before they begin their inevitable "anti-terrorism" campaign against any and all competition. 
When people start pouring money into BTC, I just can't see larger governments sitting by idly. Truly, BTC  will really see use in those governments, like Argentina, where the money has been inflated away.
Controlling the money supply has been a central point to empires, and I am really curious what is going to happen as their monies, collectively, go to shit. We all know what they will want, but they are a balancing act these days.

Good point, but regardless of the banks using BTC or Visa using it (both for a rail payment system), I think we are looking at a similar thing. They can say all they want that they don't want to use BTC, but if it performs - then after the first banks jumps on board the others will follow in a storm or be left behind.
@_date: 2015-11-17 16:38:37
I really really hope Satoshi hid those private keys well. He is the only chance of semi-controlling the BTC price as the bankers are quickly running all currencies into the ground.
Satoshi's best plan is not to have thrown out the private keys, but keep them along with his anonymity and then once BTC is extremely high, start spreading the wealth. Now that, that is every corrupt bankers/governments worst nightmare.

Better to be on the safe side when we are talking revolutionary tech. Whether or not it hurts Gavin is besides the point, as this is about BTC.

If it is a great tumbler, then maybe, but hard to know. Where computer forensics is right now, I don't think it would be hard to get a fingerprint, so to speak, of where your coins came from, if they are your via a tumbler, etc.

@_date: 2015-11-25 19:45:31
Not sure we need big companies any time soon, though sure it would help. But lets not put the cart in front of the horse. We need to get BTC ready. Over time we will see what has true value. 
If Visa can do something monumental on their own or using private blockchains, then more power to them. They need to innovate. 
There are bigger fish to fry. We have a store of value that is the best performing currency this year (or damn close). 
BTC does a lot of things and if we just talk about established companies, then we are limiting what BTC does. Not to mention just staying in the "status quo".
As long as they don't false flag BTC to death, we will probably be fine.
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:06:00
Thanks for those tidbits, especially that paraphrase and Satoshi's rebuttal. It is going to be fun to see what the banks do when their blockchain solution is not all it is cracked up to be.

@_date: 2015-11-20 17:14:24
Not sure this is misguided. It seems like an opportunistic attack for those who find BTC a threat. Be that banks, criminal governments, etc. 
I don't really believe people can be so stupid as to go after BTC when it is just an innocent baby (at this point) and when the real problems lie elsewhere. This is an opportunistic attack on "the enemy".
Just like 911 got us the Patriot Act and Homeland Security (and my aren't they doing a good job of taking down websites!), the Paris attacks and what follows, will get us more bullshit.

Nice video, got to like Reggie.
I am definitely for BTC and not private blockchains. But that said, for blockchains that might not need the strength of BTC's blockchain (and perhaps at some point, the cost as well), what is wrong with a private blockchain? It is essentially another open protocol and NOT JUST a database, certainly it is more as it is open (not really private I believe). I would like to learn more here so appreciate any comments.
I can imagine some huge blockchains co-existing with BTC but those storing value, real value, should definitely be on BTC or be pegged to BTC, something along those lines.
Ideally, all of these blockchains should be connected in time...

Actually that is the definition of inflation, but I think I know what you are getting at. As long as the demand outweighs the supply, the price will go up. e.g. - BTC is right now inflationary but the demand has been outstripping the supply.

When Google, Apple and other large tech corps start getting involved in BTC tech here, the relatively small banks are going to have a problem, a very big problem.
And don't think that corruption will take down BTC and the privatisation of the control of money. They have not thus far been able to control information as well as they hoped and they are doing a horrendous job of controlling money.
I'd say the future is bright because those who are in control have lost control.

I think Mt Gox, on the one hand, did a great dis-service (if the Willy Bot report is true) by inflating the price. Now you have a higher priced BTC which is a turn off to your average Joe. The longer the price remained low, the more BTC would Joe buy. Now it seems, big money is moving in and hopefully this doesn't lead to more of the same...

Just wait till BTC really starts to be accepted (my bet 2 years or less), and then bring it up in a meeting again and say "I'm just curious, especially those that laughed at my past suggestion, how many of you bought BTC? I did, I won't say how many, but the current price is $10,000. Anyway, dinner is on me (and BTC.) "

This is probably going to come back to haunt them, many many times over. It is sort of like talking about your ex to his/her best friends, in public, on T.V., etc. As if "we" needed another reason to dislike Pimple, I mean Ripple.

I have never heard that before. But even if that is the case, does it really matter. It is sort of like going to an exchange, putting cash in and getting Monero. They know (maybe, unless using Shapeshift and even then, if the NSA are watching...) you got some. They have to prove what you did with it.

Another hidden blessing for BTC. The first was probably Paypal cutting off Wikileaks, and now cutting off Mega. The "establishment", in a sense, is pushing customers over to BTC. 
And now Banks don't want a multi billion dollar industry that is legal??? Well, for sure some new banks will start to take up this space, but don't count out BTC to make a huge splash here either. Plenty of "Money" to go around...

As your name suggests, you are looking past the more important aspects of BTC, in sake of Capital. We are talking a dissruptive technology that is starting to be used by the system it is meant to disrupt. When we compare the BTC Blockchain to private ones over time, that will be the proof in the pudding. 
So, let's just sit back and see if the multi billion dollar one, who has thousands of people involved, can beat some private and newly created ones being designed by just a few people.
@_date: 2015-11-17 16:52:17
Of course, but that is not my point. I meant with a high BTC price he can slowly distribute those to 3rd world countries, organizations to help people, etc. 
Now if the World Bank got their hands on those, ouch.
@_date: 2015-10-11 11:32:21
Volume has been manipulated, as others have stated, for a while now. With all the big money looking at BTC it makes one wonder if they are supporting it here, only to smack it down hard and then get orders filled below once triggers go off to sell. Then the price will move up again...
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:06:44
But those behind Ripple are also hoping for it's "tokens" to have value and be used as BTC, etc. If not, all they have is the network, which is a lot, but they want their tokens to also be used as a unit of value.

Well ECB, FED, etc. You have all done a shizz job of managing money. The last people we would want to listen to when it comes to money, are people like you.
Now we have a money that functions more like a money and makes war more difficult, is inflation proof (relatively speaking) and is for and by the people (or Satoshi ;-). Just leave us alone already. Signed - people of Earth.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:05:43
Well, good point. Eventually another phase up is going to begin due, in part, to all the hundreds of millions coming in this year into infrastructure. Amazon and/or Ebay accepting BTC would be like a steroid shot and I think get that going basically at the same time - first with speculative money, then slowly as more people start using BTC there.
@_date: 2016-05-06 09:16:00
Agreed, many questions are now raised. Craig certainly seems like a computer genius and that might be partly responsible for how he presents himself. But if you look at some of his videos about Bitcoin, he seems extremely knowledgable and is really out there with all the evangelists regarding uses. Well worth the watch  and he gives some juicy info.
@_date: 2016-05-16 14:39:19
I was sort of supporting your perspective but if you want "the" perspective, "inflationary" means inflating, growing, making more, etc. as in a balloon is inflating with air. You can't really define inflationary by "all I care about are prices"- technically speaking. I mean you can have an inflationary money like the USD that grows in values because it is the most valued of the corrupt bunch.
So, Ethereum by the definition of inflation is inflationary, no ands or buts about that.
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:32:06
No, I think people will want things. I'm saying you can buy the stock cheaper after the crash. Everything will go down then.
Don't confuse a company going out of business with sales dropping. Many will survive.
Like I said, you can get the shares cheaper after a stock market collapse. It will take time to show who will benefit.

I'm not expert so there in might lie the problem. As when I listened to his videos it sounded like he had a thorough understanding of cryptography. Just boggles the mind that he thought he could get away with it. Well, we can see what happens when that trust dates date arrives, lol.

It went over $1000 in China, which is by far the biggest market in the world right now. I won't argue that the bots and Mt. Gox fiasco could have manipulated the price. 
But, I don't see your point. The world financial system is in a bad place. Gold and silver have been manipulated heavily since at least the 70's or 80's (and the US strong dollar policy - see Gata.org). There is no real safe haven you can move easily. Now we have BTC. The writing is on the wall (for one or a few of these digital currencies)...
Whichever one of these crypto's succeed, might very well be the new standard of measurement as good money might finally push out bad. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:11:38
As more and more people enter BTC and want to just purchase 1 BTC, we are going to start to see, higher and higher prices. I do wonder what is going on in China though. Interesting. Maybe some exciting days again ahead.
I like to try to explain BTC to people, in small part, by comparing it to a stock. Imagine a stock with only 12 million or so shares available to the world. This stock is also an asset and can be exchanged like a currency, quite freely. It doesn't take a lot of brainpower to see that this "stock" might some day soon be very very pricy to obtain. But, most people, even very bright ones with an IT background, can't wrap their minds around what this Disruptive Black Swan is.
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:15:57


Semantically, sure. I'm talking about overnight swaps and such. Banks have (or had) low risk places to gain money. Other Investments - People can't keep money in the bank (CD's), the rates are just too low. So, the are "forced" into putting money into their 401k or stockmarket directly. There is a reason for the obvious bubbles.


In very simple terms, if even a fair amount of the QE money went to "joe" we would see inflation. We would have to as the amounts of QE are extremely high. There is no money shortage just like there is no shortage of inches, pounds, etc. Give the money and watch the economy change. But if you give money to the mostly upper echelon of the economy, that will flourish (e.g. Stock market and load programs for everyone, even Joe, to get a home.) Interesting about the risk, who quantifies that as the FED seems to have no such rule. Long live the QE experiment.


You just left Joe in the gutter. Things have to change and word is spreading, not to mention more clarity of the problem(s).

Fair point, outside of the fake volumes, we might actually be seeing some supply and demand getting righted. We are going to hit that point eventually, which sends us into the next wave up to,  my guess, 2500 USD easy, then we probably settle back on the last 1266 or so high. Capital controls is what BTC was meant for though...

No, but supply and demand with nothing behind it, in the way BTC works, is a difficult thing to grasp.


Yeah, but successful fiat is now backed by nukes and militaries. 
Look, most people can't wrap their heads around what Bitcoin is, especially what it can be if you forget the money aspect. I'm less stating an opinion and more an observation.
How many people have you really met who understand money? I've taught at banks and can honestly say, maybe a few from the middle on up do. People are doing the 9-5 thing it seems and just buying in to any illusion that comes their way.
@_date: 2015-10-27 07:26:56
Many economists realize this is what's happening. How else can you be printing money while controlling inflation? The basic problem is that the banks would rather have no risk or low risk and put money into CD's and such than giving it to a common Joe. The ECB in Europe is doing the negative interest rates to try to force them to loan out the money instead of going for the short term flips and such.  Trickle down economics doesn't work, obviously.
Understand, Quantitative Easing is basically controlling the money supply by printing, not through interest rates. We are in for a world of pain (middle and lower class).
How can money flow to the middle class if where it is going hardly ever gets in contact with them? The reason we have a stock market bubble, in part, is because other "investments" are no longer available, so it is like a Ponzi scheme. Same with housing, it is just a bubble. Do a search on this, I can't do it justice but I've read enough statistics to prove beyond a doubt that this is happening and has been.
The banks should start a "Lend to Joe" program, (for low interest of course, we all get those high rate loan offers in the mail.) And the Federal government should just wipe student debt - Who wants to pay off an old student loan at 8% when the current rate from the FED is 0%? We could do a lot here.
@_date: 2015-10-23 07:21:44
We are talking Apples and Turkeys here. Sure, you can find some uses for a private blockchain but we are essentially talking a variation of a traditional relational data base. What groundbreaking things are banks going to do here? There is no "token" (BTC) involved and some very bright minds out there are not impressed. So let's hear how the banks are going to DISRUPT anything but there own procedures here.
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:38:35
I heard that even though a coin can go into the wrong address or even have been thrown away, lost, etc.  that when we have Private Key breaking tech in the future (and BTC moves up to avoid those weaknesses) that the old "lost" coins can be recovered (if not moved.) Not sure if that is true, maybe a crypto expert can jump in.

Thanks for your kinds words, really, there is no place for that. Just because someone doesn't see things as you do, is no sign of intelligence. If I made a mistake it was for 1. posting my opinion here and 2. Believing the Gizmo article (not Craig)
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:18:06
The banks, Visa, etc. all know about BTC's TPS rate. This is going to be scaled up. This is a young project. Not a deal breaker. When they do their testing, you can be sure they understand this current limitation. There tests are not about this simple limitation, the simple math already tells them that.
All transactions do not need to be, nor want to be, settled on the blockchain as individual transactions. Why pay a fee for every single Visa transaction? So inefficient solution with BTC in its current state. Visa, can simply e.g. use the blockchain every X amount of time and summarized transactions thus far. That is but one solution. The micro payment channels, lightning network, etc., will also be a possibility in the next year or two.
I would not judge BTC based on simply weather Nasdaq uses it or not. I could care less. Same goes for all these big companies. We will, in part, help to intermediate them. That alone makes BTC a success.
Don'T forget, BTC is attractive as a store of value as well. We have a road ahead of us, but luckily those running things like banks and such, don't know what the hell they are doing. They are the very reason for BTC's existence. If they had done things right, weren't so full of corruption, etc. we wouldn't need BTC.
And don'T forget, BTC is being tested all over the world by thousands, don'T think the IT department of a company or bank are going to remove it. This is a huge group project. And I don't bass its success purely on price, companies using it, etc. Rather it will be how it helps to take down a corrupt system, whether or not it continues to exist. It is merely a step in the right direction.
Patience BittHopper, patience ;-)

Honestly, I wouldn't want to profit due to someone else's mistake. And besides that it is in their TOS. I can see your point, that said, but if BTC is partly about making a corrupt system better, then I see no harm in extending that out and reversing an occasional mistake. Just seems like the right thing to do. 
They definitely need to have some form of protection to stop this in the future though.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:01:59

Well, look at the Vault 7 Wikileaks. That should give everyone an idea of the CIA's reach. They definitely could have found Satoshi one way or another.

(See project Mockingbird, it is just no longer a paid project, watch CNN and Washington Post to quell any doubts.)
If the CIA didn't try to infiltrate BTC, they not only weren't doing their jobs, but they suddenly stopped being corrupt, so corrupt that Kennedy wanted to "Rip them into a thousand little peaces and scatter them into the wind."
And now Craig Wright is starting a company to create something based off of BTC? Just can't make this stuff up.

A money not controlled by governments when that is how things have been for a long time, yeah, after 7 years, that is a little bitty baby. People can't grasp what it is, how it can help them, etc. They need it wrapped up in Paypal, Circle, etc. (Not all of them.)

And how much was BTC worth at it's start? Took a while to even be worth 2 Pizzas. They should show 2 Pizzas...
Then let's look back at this in 10 years. From Pizza to Trillion ;-)
@_date: 2015-10-03 13:22:14
Yeah, and globally there are certain powers at play. I think they actually love BTC as if they can control it, well, they can track most transactions. But on top of this there are proxy wars (e.g. present Syria I am afraid) and I have a feeling we will / could see BTC as another proxy. Time will tell.

I never said intelligence, that would imply emotional intelligence, etc. which he is clearly lacking. Agree with accumulated knowldege.
I'm saying in cryptography he may very well be a genius. That doesn't mean he isn't a con man though. And a few Geniuses come across terribly as they lack in other areas.
His ties to Dave Kleiman have my interest. Perhaps he is trying to take credit for something he has no tie. It was that Gizmo article that got me wondering, as at first I thought he as just a con man.

Thanks for the detailed answer. But what did I say that was wrong? IT sounds a bit like a technicality, they don'T need the deposits, but isn't that what the "fractional reserves" are based on? I mean reserve rates are what now, 5% or so? So, technically, any money that come in can then again be loaned out at whatever the reserve rate leaves? Very interesting they can loan out reserves, lol. Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:39:37
I think Negative interest rates are going to push people into BTC in those countries. Good for BTC and good for them...

Wouldn't it be interesting if the US Marshal Service worked with an exchange to move these coins? I mean it seems like an exclusive club and why not make the coins available to the common Joe (which is why I mention the exchanges assisting - e.g. offering a blind auction there.)

Seriously, very well done. Surprised we haven't seen this mentioned before, at least me...
Makes the Dave Kleiman and Craig Wright connection interesting as Dave died in 2013 and lived in Florida. Satoshi's last post was at the end of 2010 and Dave I believe was real sick those last few years. Time will tell...

Most economists are close minded with regards to What is Money.
@_date: 2015-11-21 09:02:31
I am just saying Bitcoin is real money in that it is based on sound math, while their money is based on the decisions of a few and pressing the print button. What I said is being said everywhere, just read between the lines.

I disagree as BTC at this early stage should not just be about profit. What if it doesn't come back down, will you be happy with that profit? Buy and hold (and if you already are then great, but if not, why take a chance on the next great thing?)

I think once Bitcoin really starts growing they are going to relentlessly attack it under a variety of names, pretenses, etc. Bitcoin or some variation of it will survive. And even though I am a supporter of it, I think it will be easier to get these crooks out of power than to keep these cryptos free.

@_date: 2015-10-25 13:37:57
Well, the reason you might have been downvoted is you left all that out. If we are talking a collapse though, last think on anyones mind is going to be saving money through overstock. You will be able to buy anything much much lower then. A bit complicated.
At least now your post sounds like a reasonable plan.
@_date: 2016-05-06 09:09:36
The banking system is ingrained with "shocker" very big money interests, along with a healthy does of corruption. (Please see Wachovia and HSBC for the 100's of billions of laundered drug money.) I can't imagine them letting BTC (their competition) just walk in without a fight. A very simple point but...
That said, if the banking system continues its collapse, something like BTC can actually help to save them as it could (theoretically, years from now) back up the failing QE system.
That is just the banking aspect, now throw into the mix some very big alphabet agencies and I can't imagine them sitting by. Again that said, if BTC can somehow benefit them, or be used by them, then all bets are off.
Just looking at how the media has responded to BTC thus far (attacks, ignorance, etc.) I'd say the writing is a little bit on the walls but time will tell.

People have a problem with this. I understand the tech and economics of BTC fairly well and my job brings me into contact with many. I have only spoken to a handful who sort of get it. Just an observation. I have heard the same from others. It isn't a matter of repeating something, except to repeatedly explain BTC and not have people grasp it fully, somewhat yeah. 
And likewise, look into your argument. How much that you speak about with understanding, have you actually tested firsthand and with a variety of people?

This is a pretty scary consequence of State power. And he quite clearly states that as the popularity of BTC rises, the early values (well, some of them), will go away (or rather be eaten.) And that leads to blacklisting.

That is what happens when Banks avoid giving the money to the middle class. They are giving it to the 5% and that money goes into larger assets (e.g. homes, stock market, etc.) so you won't see inflation.

@_date: 2015-10-05 16:48:47
True, but let's call it what it is, a war on people, and perhaps a war on consciousness. I just think of all the good that money could do. Agencies should not be allowed to keep money from busts, it is a conflict of interests, the wrong message...
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:22:02
Well, I heard that certain agencies do get to keep the funds from confiscated items. Perhaps I am wrong in thinking all do that. TBH though, that money should really go back to the people for rehabilitation and such (not general funds). I am curious here, looks like some laws need adjusting.
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:45:21
Let's just hope they follow the proper procedure and not just rubber stamp everything (as many expect).
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:22:12
I never mentioned me. Satoshi helped to redefine money. One thing we have learned is when 1% or 5% or whatever control the wealth, we have a lot of hardship, poverty, etc. We have to take this experiment to the next level some day and that means not even having money as we do now, or even with BTC. We need to redefine what money is and we are just starting to do that. Difficult to English.

One of the companies mentioned was known to have worked with intelligence agencies. So maybe he is more of an infiltration agent. I think just discounting the guy without looking deeper might be just as dangerous as accepting him. we need to dig behind the story. Is it just a scam?

@_date: 2015-11-29 18:35:58
This is interesting. We have spoken about banks getting on board and how when one larger bank starts accumulating BTC (or the like), how others will follow. There will be a stampede to the door; don't get left behind.
Now, there is this inkling surfacing. This would be another level of the upward price trend. Once we see larger players in this space, we are probably talking a USD price in excess of 10k. That imo is the next wave or two, the ones after that (if we can survive), is anyones guess.
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:40:11
Just because something isn't here (readily) today, doesn't mean it won't be tomorrow. This is coming from someone working with the internet from the early days. What this man is asking for is just about here, imo. Look at some of the projects being worked on currently. Ethereum comes to mind.
@_date: 2015-10-11 11:19:07
An exchange is a bit more designed to store larger amounts of BTC for trading purposes. Holding almost $ 9,000 of BTC on an Amazon purchasing sight, is a bit extreme. Pick your poison but be responsible. Unless you are buying something that is $9,000 why keep so much there?
@_date: 2015-11-16 08:11:00
More like 1/2-1% one way but it depends on size.

Interesting, I heard they had custom windows, but regardless it is quite clear (via the decision) that HSBC and Wachovia were complicit. But the final decision was something along the lines of "We can't prosecute as the people would lose fait in the banking system." Do they mean lose "more" faith? LOL, unbelievable.
@_date: 2015-10-01 18:05:35
Perhaps its less about the price and more about the security? I see your point but to have all these other cryptos only strengthens the whole space in the long run.
My feeling is this space will grow organically, with these cryptos "talking" and "interacting" with one another.
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:25:55

So, then what are you arguing for? I'm at a loss here (again).
@_date: 2016-05-05 06:32:00
Yeah, my feeling is that Craig was involved but perhaps Dave was doing a bit more of the work. Something about Craig doesn't sit right with most of us here but often we see very strange behaviour from Brainiac type individuals. Basically, none of us want Craig to be Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:26:13
I guess he still thinks the least amongst us (e.g. regulators and governments) will continue to lead us. I guess he doesn't get it.
So, rather he should ask "Are people really going to foster regulators and governments over a long period of time?" We the people think the answer is no. Welcome, our little Trojan Horse.
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:28:44
My background on this whole thing is just watching some videos and reading some articles. The Gizmo article is the one that hit hardest. Again, not saying that I think he is Satoshi, but that he could be connected. 
The story from Gizmo, which I imagine was a complete lie(?) is what got me ("evidence"). Re Kleiman, he was in a VA hospital and if his passion was Cryptography (BTC project) I see no big reason for him not to do it as he was wheelchair bound. When going by an article and not actual facts it is hard to discern, in either direction.
For the record, pre Gizmo article I thought Craig was just a full on liar. My spidy senses said too much. But that Gizmo article really got me curious. Anyway, the full story will come out as time goes on.
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:41:06

@_date: 2015-10-25 17:16:30
The hardest thing for economists, or regular people for that matter, is to see something they can't see coming. Bitcoin is a Black Swan. Some pretty intelligent people have no idea about it. I imagine economists just can't imagine what BTC is for the most part. They are trying to put it in a box and it eats boxes.

What are "they" going to do when we have the numbers and the "money"? Hopefully coinbase can help stop the favoritistic regulation but it is just a matter of time until "their" system is no longer the system. Till then, we can try to slow them down. Criminals they are.
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:24:17
Not sure this is a bubble. This is asset relocation. A lot of these alts are going to be special. And many more complete busts. We saw this in the internet bubble, but this is much more organic imo.
Also, BTC is more a store of value at this point, so other practical alts like Ripple have a real use for the banks, LTC - to handle the smaller transactions and act as a test bed, etc. Then you get into the higher risk alts...
This is just starting (and I said that in 2013 and it is just as true today.)
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:18:41
But the Cannabis companies don't need Bitpay per say. What is to stop them from just accepting BTC's and selling them on an exchange? I think most of us see Bitpay as a transitionary (and much need currently) intermediary (for volatility primarily). I know this is not ideal, lots of money, but something has to give. (some)
Funny with the banks, I understand they don't want problems. Meanwhile we have States being threatened (or at least their reps and budgets) by Senators (I believe) for letting these votes go ahead. Then we have Wochovia and HSBC complicitly involving themselves with laundering drug money, and this is wrong for them? LOL

I'm not in outright disagreement here. Yeah, I understand - I think - the importance of the network strength. And in a BTC sense I would say not to judge a crypto based purely on the price. I wonder, if push comes to shove, is it advantageous to have hashing power on CPU's? I mean  our enemy the bot can actually be our friend, along with the virus implanted hash. Not what I want mind you, I'm just talking resilience. Years away from that though.

The government will have to become more transparent, of course. But they will not be able to avoid that. The military, that is another story - "national security", which really means "We aren't telling."

You don't get to say "furthermore" when your first point was apparent to me and everyone and the reason for my post. You can't easily mine to get BTC, moreso after the halving. Buying on the open market causes the price to go up.

This is a really interesting project and area. For one, the way we see computers as sitting on the desk or the like, starts to be expanded and more abstract. I mean we seem to be slowly moving to or being pushed to, private cloud like designs (e.g. Google Drive, iCloud, etc). But with this open model can show is that the infrastructure is sort of owned by the participants (security is in their hands collectively), there is so little waste and potentially very fair redistributions/distributions of its token sjcx (Really just a symbol of value, a token is an understatement in a way. We are going to see true price discovery imo. Like in a business supply and demand type sense, lol). 
These blockchain technologies don't seem to be just a profit driven thing. There seems to be a lot of benevolence (a nice natural form of anti corruption ;-) involved for the good of people, behind some of the emerging uses. 
And this is not controlled by a single or even a few entities. It is owned by the participants. These blockchain type disruptors are going to absolutely transform current global perspectives regarding... "digital money" LOL, all the ledger/ownership based uses and all the other creative uses. 
The current business and banking world must be looking out and seeing the quickening collapse of an existing limiting "business model" being phased out with autonomous technology that is beyond their influence, at least in the normal way, can't just shutdown someone with no central location. It is rather a choice by the people and a clear expression of their will. 
Just wait till this thinking which is challenging our belief systems starts to unlock more young minds with brilliant ideas. We are watching the 100th Monkey Affect happen before our eyes. Enjoy the ride.

It is outside of economic thought, not because it is digital. It is outside of (most) economic thought because it's value is user created via supply and demand. It is not backed by anything in other words. That is a big problem for many. They can't wrap their heads around it, as it gold's value is inherent, no we give it value.
The honest truth is that many intelligent people are in BTC but most aren't, yet. Most can't grasp Bitcoin and I get to speak to IT guys like every day, finance guys less so. 
Another honest truth and perhaps the biggest one is that most people have no idea about money, inflation, deflation, etc.

Yeah, I do also feel like this is coming. But let's not make it seem like the banks have been clamouring over this. Transferwise is a great middle term solution that came from a 3rd party. I think the banks had the resources and customer demand to do this themselves but obviously aren't broken up about customer fees (enough)...

That is why you buy Overstock? It has a chance of surviving the collapse? Get some BTC, Gold and food/water. A collapse is a big big thing....

It is particularly funny as ETC is NOT the fork, ETH is. And that is fine and dandy but there was a name change of the fork back to the original. I imagine this will happen though too when BTC ups the block size?

Really? Has it been that much? If you have a link I'd appreciate it and I will share it with... Germans.

$1500 of sold BTC is money laundering? Amazing what banks like HSBC and Wachovia can get away with...

I think in the next attack they will be throwing encryption at people. 
Reminds me of a joke, what is heavier, a pound of feathers or a pound of encryption?

Interesting points he mentioned. One of corruption comes to mind. Be careful depending on where you live, if there is corruption within the local agencies (e.g. police, political, etc.) they might try to squeeze you for your BTC's.

So, does this mean BTC was created by the CIA?
@_date: 2016-07-23 22:35:58
It might get things moving if Jihan actually does run a fork. That might get a DAO like "petal to the metal" thing going and get this thing "fixed". Then he can fork back.
If you don't like what you are running on, just fork this.

QE is basically trying to direct the economy via the money supply, instead of interest (well, they can't really go any lower.)
But you are missing a part of the equation. To print money, an equivalent amount of bonds are created. What they do with these bonds is buy them back with more money they print. QE should be called "Kicking the can down the road", at least in part. I believe they also buy back assets (including bad ones) that are on banks balance sheets.
This can really go on for ever, or, as long as people go for the decreasing standard of living. (Otherwise known as theft.)

Isn't it MUCH more than that though? I mean a lot of trades are just day trading and such. And on top of that, after the halving people will be more reluctant to sell. And as the price goes up, Miners will once again join that club.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:54:55
That is interesting and thanks for filling in some blanks.
I'm really curious if you can provide any links regarding the inevitable collapse that is coming. We all feel that, but since money is in a sense faith, I wonder if they literally can just wipe the debt clean and start over, without a real depression so to speak. Keeping in mind, money is for exchange, not at all like what we are doing these days imo.
@_date: 2016-07-12 08:19:37
They print their own money and yet they are down almost 50%. Well, actually, that does make sick sense.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:39:04
sure, just another piece to the puzzle. Collect more data sets and make sense of it over time.
@_date: 2016-07-25 18:05:05
The scary thing, this will make you money...
until they shut it down.
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:06:27
People do strange things when pissed off. And people with money also do that. There is an ETH fork, that involves money, no?
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:52:37
You should be warning people about investing in Fiat money that is printed to the tune of 85 Billion a month. Be careful of the reality you choose to believe in. 
So, the kinds of people pushing up the price are people who don't want their wealth confiscated like in Cypress. The ECB has already talked about a 10% haircut in the EU, as have the American and Canadian banks. Don't let the corrupt criminals decide the future of the young. WE should own OUR money, not private individuals and banks that print it and profit from war.
At his age, he sounds ahead of your age. ;-)

One could argue the early phase of most anything new and innovative is speculative. If you don't see the big picture, just stay patient.

I'm not so sure the Chinese government will be against this. It appears they might just be trying to slow things down and thus far that is what has happened. Remember, they clearly did not try to make BTC illegal and they could have.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:48:21
Much deeper counter part risk with BTC. Look at what happened to Germany early this year after they requested half of their gold back from the US. And throw on to that all the Tungsten Filled gold out there. Do you really want to have to drill through a coin and check it for being real? 
@_date: 2016-07-24 11:25:30
Yeah, I just think of this as a natural flow in a sense. I think BTC could use a bit of that "Silk Road" spark, so to speak. Bitcoin, if anything, is not about standing still.
Fun times ahead regardless.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:42:02
You are seeing a movement of wealth. You would be wise to not look at Bitcoin as a stock per say. It is, in the sense you own a part of the network. But it is also an asset (protecting you from wealth confiscation on the way), protocol (more powerful that you can suppose), commodity, payment system, etc. The S-Curve rise is just starting.
We are witnessing the movement of wealth from inflated fiat currencies to a deflationary, decentralized, anti-fragile, black swan, owned by the people, one. :-)
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:14:42
BTC can do what you want it to. If you want to save it, then do so. Each BTC is (currently) 1 million bits (Satoshi's). If most save their coins, there is still plenty around for use. A deflationary currency will be used imo, it's just that it is not the idealistic capitalistic currency ;-)  
Anyway, putting money into BTC to make purchases will probably end up being wise and save you around 5%-10% a month or a lot more, for years to come.

But realistically, can't a lawsuit be filed against the bank(s) in question, class action? I mean if you transfer money via a wire, as long as you are not breaking any law, what right does the bank have to intercede?

Why not integrate the change into an alt Crypoo as if it is a test bed and see how it works?

@_date: 2013-12-10 08:08:45
Well, don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. If you are in BTC for the money, then perhaps it is better off. We need people into BTC for all the other benefits like changing government. If that affects your bottom dollar, then so be it. Welcome, I mean goodby from, the revolution.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:56:50
Huh? They clearly said that they would discuss it with you BEFORE ever doing it? What more do you want? A whole lot better and more reasonable that what BOA and other private banks have already started to do. No to mention not even discussing it with customers.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:38:46


At least give it a shot. If they get enough requests it will become a headache for them. So, at least give them a headache, seems to be going round.

That day is approaching or at least something like it. In Germany Fidor bank is getting behind BTC. It will only take a handfull of banks getting behind BTC to F the other banks not getting behind it. And we have a nice record of those "other" banks... ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:08:51
Bubble - People are just starting to get into BTC. This is just starting. And BTC isn't a stock, it is a currency, stock in the network, asset (primarily right now), payment system. protocol (HUGE uses here), commodity, etc.?
To try to put this into a box with the word "bubble", shows you don't really understand what BTC is. Further, there are only 12 million "shares" in a manner of speaking, further divisible by 100 million = 12 hundred Quadrillion bits. We are talking a Market cap in the hundreds of Billions, if not Trillions eventually. I think you can work a calculator...
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:12:40
The simple solution is to use services that act as escrow (holding the BTC until the money clears). You will then be transferring money to another person (using a rating system). But in smaller amounts. Of course this makes trading a lot more difficult but just to acquire and sell within 2 days or so (quicker if you have instant transfers) there is little the banks can do to stop it.

BTC's are being bought in China at about 5X the rate of America. Just watch this for a bit 
The people are somehow getting money into an exchange and have been as of Wednesday (when things picked up again).

The hearing is a very delicate thing and I'm not sure people realize that. If the U.S. comes off as hard handed it can blow up in their face. What happens if they do that and the price continues up? That is the middle finger from the world to the U.S. Government. Their best course of action is just to go with the flow, for lack of a better word. And it can't be restated enough, they don't want to further F the U.S. economy by pushing innovation out the country (which is clearly already happening with BTC.) Further, we need regulatory guidance so the banks, paypal, etc. can stop being prudes about this.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:41:53
Considering there are more people inside China than outside it, I'd say it's safe to say that "Yes, we do care." Is it a deal breaker - no. But they sure will make a huge difference.
