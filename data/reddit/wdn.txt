A bit of b and c. There's bitcoin the concept and bitcoin the specific currency.
Rather than mobile phones, I would compare it to something like social networking. First came Friendster and Orkut and MySpace and people laughed at them and said it will never last and felt proven right when those sites declined. But now Facebook dominates the web, so those earlier sites weren't actually wrong in concept, they just didn't manage to be the ones to make it take off. 
The concept of bitcoin is here to stay. Whether it will be this particular instance of it that becomes dominant is an entirely different question (and I have no idea how to answer that one).

Well neither company when they launched thought that web-based instant payment between individuals was their product, but for both of them this became the primary reason people used them almost instantly. So they were competitors in fact, if not in their business plans.
As is usually the case when companies combine, they took awhile after the merger to decide which brand/product to stick with. Until the x.com product was discontinued, they were separate products with separate web sites. I had an account with each until the x.com product was discontinued. The x.com product was an actual bank account with a real bank, and you got checks and a debit card, etc., so it was a pretty clear discontinuation of a product when they cut it, not merely a change of branding. They helped you transition your money into a PayPal account, but it was very clear that the x.com account was closing.

You could (at that time) suggest a payment method. If it wasn't in the listing nor agreed before you bid and the seller didn't like it, you'd be required to use the method in the listing. But no payment method was disallowed by eBay at that time.

I don't know what the corporate arrangement was (merger, takeover, etc.) But they became a new company which discontinued the x.com product and kept PayPal's.

Can you tell me which points you think are wrong? I had both PayPal and x.com accounts from the time they each launched.

Heh. I'm just an observer from the sidelines of bitcoin so far. I hadn't noticed what sub this was when I first replied. I thought it was an actual TIL.

No. PayPal and x.com were originally competitors and PayPal had the $5+$5 bonus (five for the new account and five for the referrer) while x.com gave ten for the new account. Later PayPal bought x.com.
PayPal's original product was the ability to beam money between Palm Pilots. Logging on to the web site to transfer money was a back-up method.

The fact that he was riding on grass instead of pavement was an intentionally built-in penalty. The grass isn't there to look pretty. The fastest way to get to the finish line is to stay on the paved track.
