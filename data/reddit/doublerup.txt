Ok, maybe it's changed. Mine didn't go through til Manfred personally approved (since he was only arbiter at the time).

Yeah and blocks are always making mempool so empty! No fee market = no champaign! Sad!

Who does they refer to? The North American Bitcoin Conference can process the payments. Network congestion causing inefficiency because transaction won't clear til conference ends.

Why do you go to this hippy argument? If you don’t own the trademark, you don’t own the brand. Bitcoin can’t be trademarked. Call it what you want, but your argument allows other people to call things what they like.

It’s a free site. What business

What did you do with airdropped BCH? Your flip will pay off when operation dragonslayer is complete.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:28:25
haha sry my bad. I see it now. Frustrated with bcash "joke" being explained everytime it's written.

Yes bitcoin.org was satoshi’s vision of bitcoin info hub so anything else must die 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:44:46
Helpful man made video for your problem

BCH will change in price based on demand. I could count on tether to be $1, in reality $0

It's a question, not inquisition. You can just give a human answer like "Technically, without proof of work, it is a mutable database."

Loved this part
"Bitcoin Cash was a proposed scaling solution that was taken off-chain as there was a disagreement with on-chain solutions, such as SegWit. There is also another on-chain solution in the pipes, the lightning network."
