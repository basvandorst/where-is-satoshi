I'm hoping they won't have a breakfast buffet halvening - where they take half the food selection away every so often leaving everyone to fight for whatever's left

Sorry to burst your bubble but In short don't bother
You are about 18 months too late. The R9 290x does about 1 megahash tops. You will only get literally cents per day with that setup even if your electricity is free.
To give you an idea I have 1 SP20E miner which is running at 1.2 terahash and it nets me just $4 USD per day before electricity costs.

I'm sorry but the only way BTC is going back down to $10 is unless everyone loses faith in it due to some technical issue that cannot be overcome (highly unlikely) or a competing currency is seen as even more revolutionary and therefore everyone jumps ship (also very unlikely IMHO).

Speak for yourself you young whipper snapper i just turned 74.
