The altcoins in my portfolio that I bought a week ago are up 50-100% on average. I got into ADA on the 1st and have a 100% R.O.I. with plenty of climb to go. Bitcoin meanwhile is floating within a narrow 10% range, day to day.
On a roulette table, there's a house advantage. Buying altcoins (with any intelligence whatsoever) is betting in your favour i.e. free money. Diversified altcoin investment is a hedge fund that prints free money..

You're off by a factor of 200.
one 200 millionth.

What's to explain? Bitcoin has a very high base value and its volatility is relatively low. It's easier for Cardano or Stellar to double in value than it is for bitcoin.

20/20 is average. You can see something at 20 feet that the average chump can see at 20 feet. Hindsight is anything but a coin flip.

"After all he made the right decision."
Hindsight bias.
If I hand you a revolver loaded with one bullet and tell you that if you put the gun to your head and pull the trigger, you'll win a dollar, and you put the gun to your head and pull the trigger and DON'T BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, you *did not* make the right decision. You did something completely fucking recklessly stupid even though you are now a dollar richer with nothing lost.

Didn't realise I was wasting my fucking time.

Shame you *absolutely fucking ruined it* with the patronising /s bullshit.

Reddit is so garbage sometimes.

20/20 means you can see something at 20 feet that the average person can see at 20 feet. That's dogshit. 50th percentile. Median. Average. A coinflip. Guessing.

It's a rookie mistake to sell on a dip with a regular commodity on any exchange, like gold or oil or currency pairs.
But with Bitcoin, it's extra stupid and grievous to panic and sell. Think about it this way - everyone that has ever panicked and sold their bitcoin now regrets it. Every single person. Bitcoin is easy mode. You can't fuck up unless you fuck yourself up and panic and sell at a loss.
The only way is up. It's fucking BITCOIN. You're not pulling out to minimise damage, you're pussying out after taking the hardest (and most fleeting) hit that ez mode Bitcoin can pull.
HODL HODL HODL. It isn't just a meme.
