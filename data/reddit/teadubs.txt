Honestly, the tone of responses has surprised me. I think my entire post could definitely have ended with "for now". I'm aware that bitcoin is changing and evolving and a lot of the problems that currently exist will likely be worked out. I might even get back in when that happens, but that doesn't change the fact that, at the moment, it's got issues, one of them being the community's response to people who, by their own admission, are confused and make mistakes. 
The voice of this post is definitely not authoritative, because I'm DEFINITELY not an authority on this. I couldn't even process wtf the 12 word thing was for! In my post I even say "I don't think bitcoin is bad. And I recognize that this happened because I fucked up." I'm really surprised that saying "there are a lot of easy, very costly mistakes to make right not, and that's bad for going mainstream" was met with such vitriol. Thank you for not being a dick.

There are a lot of easy, very costly mistakes to make right not, and that's bad for going mainstream. I know because I made like 4 of them, and one of them cost me my bitcoins.

Your username is incredibly accurate for this situation.

Based on how difficult it seems to be to get USD into mtgox or other sites, I was REALLY impressed with how quickly and easily I got money into my bitfloor account.

This is where I'm at. The money I used to purchase the bitcoins is on hold, and no bitcoins have been added to my account, so I can't move anything to my wallet.

Yeah, but trying to predict the future is FUN!
(I'm thinking monday-ish too, bounce to about .95-1)

I just got a message on Bitfloor saying they're aware of issues with things being "on hold" and they're resolving them.

I'm fully aware that the graph is generic, and not based on bitcoin. That's why I called it a plot showing a "stereotypical bubble". I debated between using the word "typical" instead, but decided "stereotypical" worked better because that chart is nothing if not oversimplified. 
As for the idea that bitcoin is something new, and is therefore exempt from the traditional predictions and analyses used, I think that's naive. Even if we're using the bitcoin is the new internet analogy, the dotcom bubble followed this chart quite closely. The chart is a model for how bubbles have worked in the past. Thinking bitcoin is somehow super special, especially at this is VERY early phase, is a bad idea.
I'm literally just entertaining myself by playing "predict-a-price" at my desk at work. I'm not selling or buying right now, I'm just bored, and thought I'd get other guesses to liven up my day.

I literally just got back from the bank doing the same thing, only I bought bitcoins at 170, the site crashed, and I have no idea whether or not my order went through or what the current state of my money is. Yay!

I have no idea what this means...
To what are those numbers referring?
