I used once and I remember it charged me 5%. I still think the fee can be lowered when BTC ATMs become more popular and more people use them.

This is so nice. Loving it :)
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:42:57
I smell something big is coming... :)

There are two popular light-weighted wallets for PC. They are Electrum and multibit. They both don't store the whole blockchain. You are free to try and see if which one is better for you :)
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:50:14
No question about it.
He just deserves this.
@_date: 2015-05-16 20:31:53
It is indeed an easiest way. It will also help spread the usage of Bitcoin in the region.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:09:10
Yes that's the beauty of open-source and open discussion.
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:59:48
Just help to promote Bitcoin within your computer science group.
Maybe one day one or more programmers within your group will become a major Bitcoin developer. ;)
@_date: 2015-05-10 14:34:23
It's nice to see the price is not so volatile recently :)
@_date: 2015-05-24 15:49:11
Having a middlemen is basically a bad thing. We all want decentralization.
Governments will just need to make some changes in order to survive.
@_date: 2015-05-17 17:43:46
I just hope everyone's funds there will be safe.
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:36:31
No need to make it so complicated. Changes that allow governments to get taxes from individuals/organizations with all their income including cryptos will be enough.

Find them on Coindesk
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:59:50
Please just throw to me. 
I just use it to learn mining, not for making profit :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:15:34
Very detailed. May try it out
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:42:12
Do you offer free top-level domains?
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:03:19
If you want to test a terrible name, just make an altcoin yourself and name it "terrible coin".  :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:30:58
Yes it seems very inconvenient :(
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:08:32
Ask your friend in the US to help?
@_date: 2015-05-11 05:58:56
Yes but Bitcoin is not only designed for day traders.
For mass adoption, we can't afford to have such a large % of price changes everyday.
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:52:55
Why you still hold funds on blockchain.info after you got hacked the first time?
@_date: 2015-05-09 10:57:47
How about double the block size for each block reward halving?
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:26:54
Can I just download bitcoind from bitcoin.org and then run it immediately?
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:16:19
That is why I like Bitcoin so much :)
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:29:31
Why do you think the person who gonna buy your fb account won't change the password before you do?
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:27:43
I don't think I'll sell my phone number cheaper than my facebook password. It is because I can always create a new facebook account easily for free.
@_date: 2015-04-07 14:08:07
Wall street needs to make money from price fluctuations. 
So you will possibly see new highs, or new lows.
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:19:27
Thanks for the valuable information. I learn something new today. :)
@_date: 2015-04-16 06:09:37
Encourages new participants to use Ripple?
Sorry I won't.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:38:44
You should understand that price can go up or go down. :)
@_date: 2015-04-12 03:11:02
Congrats! I'm sure the more you use Bitcoin the more you'll love it :)
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:07:23
So many unconfirmed transactions because there is no new block found for over 70 minutes since the last block height 352792.
@_date: 2015-04-24 14:01:38
Go find another VC who knows crypto better. :)
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:30:45
Need more exchanges for altcoins. Such as Poloniex and ccex.
Also suggest to build an Android app for it and put it in play store.
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:34:13
I must say I agree with what you said here.
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:46:09
Looks great. Can't wait to try when I go there.
@_date: 2015-02-01 12:51:53
Happy Birthday :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:56:08
Fake but would really love to see Spotify accepting Bitcoin... may be later.
@_date: 2015-02-05 07:09:12
Because people just don't know they have better alternatives.
