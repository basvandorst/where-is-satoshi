Hedge your bets and hodl it. You lose nothing but potentially have a lot to gain.

This new authoritarian government here is out of control.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:12:36
Oh I agree. Which is why I'm very much for calling it Bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:08:01
If by 2020 BTC is 49% under McAfee's prediction it'll be awesome.

"users confusing Bitcoin Cash with the real Bitcoin"
Haha BURN!
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:45:41
This is different. An altcoin (BCH) is massively gaining against BTC. In the past a drop in BTC meant a drop for alts too. Hodling is really hard right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:44:31
Platinum. No way I'm selling. If BTC dies then so does the money I put into it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:08:09
On the contrary, I'm someone who convinced my wife to let me buy 1 BTC at 5600 and am now watching BCH gain at incredible speed while BTC sheds 1000 in around 24 hours. There's nothing I want more than BTC to dominate, but any sane individual can see that this doesn't look good...
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:26:13
I'm probably the only person in Korea buying BTC over BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:35:10
Here's hoping.

I hodl because I want my daughter to grow up not having to worry about money.

Haha nice. This is one of my favorite all time songs. I just sang your version to the tune. It was pretty funny.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:37:14
Mother-in-law = wife's mother. She knows it's a complete gamble and might fall to nothing. She's in it for the long term hodl. (On my Ledger Nano S - it would be truly terrible for her to forget about it...)

You'll no doubt think that it's a cop-out, but most of the major forums are at cafe.naver.com and require you to sign up and post a certain number of times before getting access. If you want to take the time to do it then head on over.

BCH has risen around 50% in the last 24 hours, driven largely by insane levels of buying in Korea, where it commanded around 75% of crypto purchases today. What gives?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:38:16

I said to "reduce tax". The ultimate goal would be to eliminate it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:17:04
Yeah private companies would NEVER build roads! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:18:50
I'm in Korea and this is true. The main crypto messageboards are full of comments like "well, it was a nice ride" and "it's over folks" and "get out while you still can". FUD is massive in Korea at the moment. This could get very messy.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:21:30
Local governments can buy up some Bitcoin and pay with that! But in all seriousness, I see no problem with governments investing in order to reduce the tax burden on their citizens. Current tax rates are insane.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:48:46
Yep. I mentioned in a few posts over the past few days that a lot of Koreans were pulling out of crypto, but I was met with a lot of skepticism. One only has to have a cursory glance at the volume on Korean exchanges to see what's happening.
I just convinced my Korean mother in law to buy 1 BTC though, so I'm doing my bit! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:33:27
It's true. Korean crypto messageboards are in meltdown.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:53:38
This is where I've been buying my crypto. I really like their service. Hopefully Nexon doesn't f**k it up.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:37:55
There's this concept called toll roads.
