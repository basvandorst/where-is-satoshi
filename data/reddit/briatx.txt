@_date: 2014-06-16 17:51:07
But wait, how does this use bitcoin?  Also, what will you do once your fiat collapses to nothing or is no longer accepted?
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:21:13


1) Because EVERYONE else does, and I don't have to worry if someone will take it or not.  It has ubiquitous liquidity while bitcoin proponents cheer every time some mom and pop decides to accept it.
2) Because it is vastly more stable even taking into account the continued debasement of the USD.  I don't have to worry about a 60%+ haircut overnight due to volatility.
3) Because safety is insured via FDIC deposits, at least while the US government is solvent.  Which, while it may not last forever... I wouldn't hold your breath guys.
4) Goods are priced in USD at most places.  Not bitcoin, even where it is accepted.
5) Because I have to pay taxes in it.
6) Because people have to accept it as payment for debts.
7) Because there is no better alternative in the US.  This includes bitcoin.
8) Because using it is more convenient.  Yes I know you will balk but you won't take into consideration how many hoops you have to jump through just to get bitcoin, you will just focus on the ease of transferring it.  
9) Credit cards, while imperfect and run by money grubbing corporations, are still better for the consumer than bitcoin, which only transfers risk from the vendor to the consumer.  The consumer is better protected from fraud using credit cards.
Anyway, I'm sorry if all of this gets in the way of your get rich scheme.  
PS:  If you were to dump all bitcoins on the market right now... you would not get "billions."  That market cap number is a mirage... the liquidity just isn't there.

Thank you for that great example of a completely meaningless and ultimately irrelevant apples and oranges comparison.
Not all computing power is equal, as you should well know, and general computing power such as what is used in supercomputers is much more expensive than your bitcoin mining ASIC arrays.
The only thing that matters would be the replacement cost... which is easily within the resources of the NSA should they choose to use it.  They don't.  They wouldn't.  But they COULD.
In fact, they could easily create a bitcoin ASIC fab and start selling backdoored mining rigs to witless buyers. 
They could also subvert or infiltrate bitcoin development.  Compromised compilers, backdoored libraries or random number generators that would produce an official, yet backdoored, binary without any apparent source code changes.
Your magical mitigation list is not adequate since many of the "solutions" are "turn those machines back off!"  until they can somehow fix it.  That is not a reasonable workaround for a prime time, mainstream transaction processor.  Confidence is a fickle and fleeting thing and that kind of "mitigation" would destroy it.
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:57:53
That's absurd!  I can't think of any legitimate reason to find fault or flaws with bitcoin.  Everyone should have direct deposit into coinbase RIGHT NOW and then max out their credit cards and buy bitcoin... otherwise they'll miss out when bitcoin goes to $40,000.

This is an enormous red herring.
Nothing about using bitcoin addresses or solves any of the major problems in the global financial system because the most recent crisis was at the most fundamental level about overleverage and malinvestment.  
Bitcoin would not solve those problems.  And furthermore bitcoin would make trying to resolve an overleverage crisis harder.  It does not take a huge amount of effort to see how a fixed and presumably deflationary fixed money supply would negatively affect a crisis scenario involving incestuous overleverage and cascading defaults.
Waving your hands and saying a different monetary system would fix everything because it's different is not convincing because, well, it used to be different... and then we got the great depression.  Oh well, better argument next time.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:41:05
Thanks for displaying the legendary maturity level.
I won't respond to your ad hominems, but skipping over the hypocritical bitcoiner hate of altcoins, here are the reasons why bitcoin is not currently better than current mechanisms.
1) It is less anonymous than actual cash.  
2) It is less accepted than cash, credit cards, or even paypal.
3) You have to give up half a percent to 1% off the top to buy it off an exchange.
4) The steps required to buy bitcoin are more risky (see: mtgox) and more convoluted than paypal or credit.
5) Paypal and credit cards protect the consumer from vendor fraud.  This protection is lost and even reversed with bitcoin.  Now the consumer takes on all of the transaction risk with very little recourse.  Therefore bitcoin is actually worse for consumers buying online.
6) It is less stable than fiat currencies, thus makes a relatively poorer store of value and could easily lead to haircuts/gains of 60% or more.
7) Deposits are not insured by the government and usually not insured by anyone.  Any insurance added onto bitcoin will increase fees.
8) As a secondary result of points 4, 5,6 and 7 it is ultimately less secure.
And now I eagerly anticipate your detailed rebuttal.  I'll be back with popcorn.

@_date: 2014-03-10 09:50:35
Yeah, man.  No one could possibly legitimately disagree that bitcoin is going to 40,000 USD and will take over the world killing off all the languishing, gasping, dying paper fiat monies of the world.
Thus Occam's Razor suggests the most straightforward answer is that government agencies are conducting psyops in order to bring down the crypto currency that was actually developed by the NSA.  Or not... we don't really know.  But it is definitely not possible for anyone to have a legitimate belief that maybe a lot of people will lose money buying into something which acts and looks something like a pump and dump scheme and which has legitimate flaws which will hinder, if not block entirely, bitcoin's use at real scale.
Nevermind that the NSA could easily, if they wanted, hack any bitcoin endpoint of their choosing and destroy bitcoin's future that way.  So it can't be the NSA conducting psyops, it must be the CIA then, since they are always jealous of NSA's budget.
So go away psyop agents, heretics, and rabblerousers.  What we need here is to preserve the echo chamber... where buyers always buy and never sell or utter the words "actually bad news" and everyone can go to the moon together.  Satoshi's will be done.  Amen.

It's ok.  You can tap out. Most of you in do.
You might have a point about third world countries.  But extremely poor people don't have much money by definition so how much are they really going to buy online.
In the US poor people unable to hold a credit card have the option of a per paid debit card that acts as a credit card like netspend that you can buy and refill at any 7-11.  I will say this though, if bitcoin could compete in this market while isolating me from volatility risk I would be tempted to buy one.  Assuming the vendors I transact with actually take bitcoin... which isn't a given.

Most of the altcoins are very similar to bitcoin in technology and implementation.  They only vary on some parameters, but mostly the level of adoption.  
I see bitcoiners say that altcoins are pump and dump schemes, designed to make the creators rich.  All speculation.  Less secure.  Less liquid.  Ultimately not better than the existing technologies.  
These are all things that I think are true about bitcoin vs what you would call "legacy" transaction mechanisms using our "dead fiat money."
I think it is quite hypocritical to tell you the truth.  But I understand the fear... all bitcoin has over altcoins is the adoption rate and it has to maintain that lead at all costs lest it just become one coin of many, and not the one coin to rule them all.

Why can't you compare paypal to bitcoin?  It's much more analogous than paper cash.
His point was that even if a company provides those services for bitcoin, they will have to charge fees that will most likely be close to paypal's fees.

@_date: 2014-06-03 07:33:28
I'm not sure how you got from...




At least with a straight face.  
You realize of course that Bitcoin is still, even 5 years down the road, fringe, compared to fiat, credit cards, banking, etc etc etc.  Not only that but it forces the user to pay more fees, carry more risk, and provides less protection, and is harder to use and secure.  After MtGox et al, Bitcoin does not exactly exude what you call a "good stable reputation".
What's the number now, 1.68 million Bitcoin users?  Congratulations, that's half a percent (0.5%) of the US population.  Vs world population, a very mighty showing of 0.0234%.
But this doesn't mean that Bitcoin is failing to win the adoption battle, it just means that we're still in the upper bottom middle top half of the first inning.  Right?  Amiright?
Oh, by the way, number of myspace users?  50 million. Looks like y'all have some catching up to do.

Well, first, belief in something doesn't make it true.
Second, if the price of bitcoin stabilizes at $1/coin would that make you happy?  That would be better for bitcoin as a CURRENCY.
Fiat, is as we all know, steadily debased by inflation.  However, at least it is mostly predictable debasement.  I don't live in Argentina so I don't have to worry about losing 50% in a year.  If I did, I would be buying gold, not bitcoin.
In the US, the inflation target is proclaimed to be 2% a year.  Not nearly as bad.  Of course if I want to avoid debasement I am forced to invest, but at least I can choose the market and level of risk I am willing to accept.  With bitcoin, it's just pretty much bitcoin.  That coincidentally has what appears to me to be a repeating pump and dump pattern in its chart.
Still, trying to claim superior stability than one of the worst fiat currencies on the planet (and one that doesn't affect me personally) is not very convincing.
I agree with you if the price of bitcoin never goes down then it would be a good investment.  I also agree that if the price of bitcoin never goes down then it would increase the people that would buy bitcoin.  You know what other asset had prices that never went down?  
That's right, housing.  
You know what they call a reinforcing feedback loop of buying as the price only goes up? 
That's right, speculative mania.
You know what the range of time it takes for speculative manias to burn out?  
That's right, 5-7 years.  Bitcoin is now a little over 5 years old.  If it hasn't already peaked, I predict it will do so within 2 years.

According to wikipedia the NSA has an ANNUAL estimated budget of 10.8 BILLION USD.  Do you think even 1 billion USD has been invested in mining?  I sure don't.  $10.8B is about $3B more than the current market cap of bitcoin... and not to belabor the point of the word ANNUAL... but that's every year.  
Don't fool yourself.  The NSA, if they wanted, could without question, fuck with bitcoin 24/7.  But why mess with such a good and reliable source of SIGINT?

Yes, I see your "Bitcoin is not a protocol" and I raise you "protocols have it even worse."
Several of you made this claim, I'm only going to respond to one.
In what metaphysical universe can you possibly assert that first mover advantage "is a sure thing" (whatever that means) for protocols.
Let's go back in time, shall we?  Quick review.
When's the last time you used [Gopher?]( [Ftp?]( [Telnet?](  [IRC?]( [POP3?]( [ICQ?]( [AIM?](  [RSS?]( [RTSP?]( The list of earlier but dead protocols goes on and on.  Then there's myriad format wars, phone wars, tablet wars, wireless specification wars, social network wars, search wars, etc.
Sure, you might still be using some of those.  Sure, there have been a few protocols that have had significant lasting power.  But it is not even close to a sure thing.  In fact, it is much more likely that protocols get supplanted and replaced than to stick around.  
Even the stickiest protocol of them all, ipv4, is due to be replaced because of a hard cap on the number of ip addresses.  
And then you have the fact that Bitcoin's protocol is not even unique, because it is easily forked and copied by anyone.  This increases the chances of someone doing better and replacing Bitcoin.  Imagine if the established powers decide to fork and compete?  Where's your network effect now?

Hmm, that's interesting.

Because, oh, I dunno... something called intellectual honesty.
I like to challenge my thinking.  It will either eventually convince me that I was wrong, or reinforce my current position.
And bitcoin has been found wanting.  Sorry you guys don't feel the same way, but I guess blind faith is easier.

Bitcoin pegged to the dollar would take speculation out of the equation as well as make things priced in USD defacto priced in bitcoin.  Without speculation there would be more incentive to spent bitcoins rather than hold them.  And of course it would have the stability of an actual currency, rather than the wide volatility that it currently displays.  This makes it, as you say, a payment transaction system and not a currency.
I prefer gold because it has stable, standalone value and acts as a good hedge to fiat debasement over time.  It's fungible, liquid, well accepted, and has stood the test of time.  It doesn't depend on a network of miners, electricity, internet connections, stock markets, or banks.  It IS speculative and it IS volatile, but not to the same degree as bitcoin.  Peak to current spot gold fell about 27%.  Peak to current spot with bitcoin... about 58% loss.  I like it as a currency devaluation hedge.  Whether or not bitcoin is the better investment depends on a lot of things.  Entry point, exit point.  Whether or not you were able to realize gains before mtgox imploded.  Etc.  
I also think bitcoin is in a speculative mania.  So that is the main reason I wouldn't buy it.
I agree that bitcoin is much more interesting as a payment system, but sadly without the speculative mania it might be hard for miners to justify mining financially.  Also, the bitcoin style transaction system is no longer unique to bitcoin as all the altcoins have it as well.
To wrap up just a few points in response to the advantages you listed.
1) Current internet payment processors can do much of these things already, with the added benefit of fraud protection.
2) Buying into bitcoin requires fees off the top.  Buying bitcoin at exchanges is also subject to approval, is not instant, is not anonymous and also carries with it the non-zero chance of exchange failure and loss of funds.
3) This is picky, but technically bitcoin has a maximum balance of however many coins have currently been mined.  And a minimum balance of 0.
4) Merchants like the no chargeback feature, but note that this transfers the risk of merchant transactions from the vendor to the customer.  So bitcoin is better for merchants, but inferior to paypal and credit cards for consumers.  Which one, do you think will drive adoption?
5) Some of the printing press and hyperinflation claims seem contrived to me.  Bitcoin creates new coins on a set schedule up to a cap.  The only thing that enforces this cap is the consensus of people running mining software.  Nothing says that can't change.  Also, even if people aren't making more bitcoins they are making tons more altcoins.  Also, if the price of bitcoin converges to zero (yes, this is possible)... even without the hyperinflation of the printing press... what is the difference to the holder of bitcoins?
I think you have a point on international wire fees.
So basically in closing:
1) I am skeptical that bitcoin offers real advantages over our current system of payments.  Cash, credit cards, paypal.
2) Bitcoin carries real risks that are negated with the current banking and online payment systems.  
3) Without the speculative gains I can't see why anyone would want to mine or hold bitcoins, unless it is simply for ideological reasons.
4) Nothing is stopping established players from adopting innovating transaction technologies in order to compete with bitcoin.
5) Cryptocurrency might win and bitcoin itself lose.
6) Bitcoin is likely in a speculative mania.

Well, depending on what you believe it was lost (via Karpeles losing the private keys... which is not very believable, if you ask me) or it was stolen.
So I apologize, I meant to say stolen, not lost.  Feel better now?

Dude, you just don't understand exponential growth forever.  There's always never a better time to buy bitcoin.

Take that critical thinking and get OUT of this subreddit.  This isn't the place for it.

Well good thing bitcoin isn't limited in what it can do or where it's accepted...
Oh, wait.

Excellent commentary.  It is fascinating to watch the mistakes of the past being so mindlessly recreated.
The exits of bitcoin are so narrow that if (when?) the panic comes very many people will be trapped.  I thought the collapse of Gox would kick that off and I'm somewhat surprised that it hasn't.  But I imagine most people prone to panic were locked in at that point and the die hards believe that it was only a bad apple.

Yes that is why I love Zero propaganda.  Full of completely rational and objective voices of reason.
@_date: 2014-04-10 01:32:00
Thank you for a reasonable response.
Yes, who can say what will happen in the future.  Bitcoin has potential, as does litecoin and doge and all the rest.  Maybe the idea of blockchain based transactions does take off in the future and eventually becomes the pervasive worldwide transaction mechanism for the entire world.  Even if this happens there is nothing that mandates that bitcoin will be the ultimate winner.
But that is not the reality NOW.  And I was commenting on how things are CURRENTLY, and I think you agree that those criticisms are fair and accurate.
However, looking into the future, as the Bitcoin services ecosystem grows, fees will grow with it.  Want escrow?  More fees.  Want insurance?  More fees.  Since low fees are really the main competitive advantage of bitcoin, this seems to be a problem.
Furthermore, I don't understand how Bitcoin proponents think that the established money power will sit around and do nothing but watch as the hypothetical bitcoin takeover happens.  Expect the banks and payment processors to compete vigorously, and, shock, maybe even cut fees.
There's a lot more that can happen than is being prophesied here.
My guess is that it is an ingenious long con, but a con none the less, and designed to transfer money from those true believers who buy into it.

Ok, so the fees aren't technically fees.  That makes sense, got it.
This just in, the credit card fees aren't technically fees either, they are now electronic payment transmission tolls.
The feeless case is exceptionally rare.  If a vendor is accepting payment, they are probably doing it via Bitpay (which charges something not technically fees but are fee like in look and feel).  If they're not, and they want their transaction confirmed today, they'll have to pay a bitcoin transaction fee.
But if you are mining, you can get feeless bitcoins, even though mining costs money in equipment and electricity, those costs technically aren't fees either.
And if you receive a gift by someone paying zero transaction fees, then that transaction is fee free.  However, because we haven't reached the bitcoin level cap and new bitcoin is being created every day your bitcoin holding is being diluted which acts as an inflationary redistribution of value so that the miners can pay the electricity bill, but is also technically not a fee.
I think you've convinced me.

If it seems like bitcoin is bad for consumers, it's because bitcoin is actually bad for consumers.

Oh you received it in your personal email.  So that's like the Bible then.
I find it quite easy to believe that someone involved in bitcoin was arrested.  I'm having a much harder time believing that a federal prosecutor is openly and illegally extorting money.
If it is civil forfeiture they just seize the property and make you sue to get it back.  No more extortion needed.
Also this part here in the OP:


Sure sounds like a donation request.  In case someone wanted to contribute.
I'm sure the guy's legal defense and extorting federal prosecutor will see every dime, honest!

Assuming someone does implement a service on top of a blockchain, what makes you think it will be using Bitcoin's blockchain?
I think most of them are forking Ethereum, and even then they will be a blockchain unto themselves.  Sorry if you thought that meant people buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-05 18:42:35
Because there hasn't been any cases in recent memory of Feds seizing bitcoins then auctioning them off to the public later...
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:31:34
I find this to be hilarious.
There's very little benefit of bitcoin over paypal or credit cards for legitimate purposes and in a lot of cases it's actually worse for the consumer.
Everything you say about litecoin can be said about bitcoin.  And from a technical perspective there is no advantage that bitcoin has over litecoin or vice versa.
But don't let your cognitive dissonance get in the way of a pumping up a good bubble.
