You don't need to do anything, you can claim your BCH at any point. So if BCH does increase in value you'll still have it to trade.

Correct. Our banking system appears to be more customer focused that the US. There is quite a a lot of competition here as it's easy to switch bank accounts.

Accurate response. I suppose you could set limits on the buy order to avoid dips and slow down your sale. Assuming he could actually sell the factory then get hold of the BTC (I doubt it). I may convert them into Monero, flee the country, wait patiently and hope no one comes to get me (??). I don't see how you could convert them back into euros, the bank would have some questions.

You would provide bank statements. They may ask to remote view your screen while you're on your banking website or for you to post statements on headed paper. The seller would have to do the same thing.

If they're on an exchange you don't control them, the exchange does. If the exchange shut down tomorrow what would your recourse be? Just move them to a wallet you control.

I think it's because most of the coins are kept in cold storage (so require manual intervention to remove) and lots of people are withdrawing at the same time.
