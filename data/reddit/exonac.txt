Very dubious article mixing up a lot of things. Apparently The central bank is warning against using bitcoins. But is it really forbidden?
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:29:50
"The idea here is that the token always remains a token of a certain value in bitcoins and can be passed around physically or stored physically, it never gets destroyed just like cash."
If that is true, you are right. However I don't think that's necessary or was even intended by op.
I would assume that the paper wallet would be destroyed right after paying with it. I don't see any problem with that.
Edit: op wrote: "A retailer scans the private key, immediately withdraws the btc[...]"
I think you misunderstood.

It depends on the machine.
On the machine there is either a wallet that holds a limited amount of bitcoins (as seen in Berlin:  or the machine is connected to an exchange (as seen in Vancouver: 
For the user to get BTC they put bills in the machine then usually he or she provides an address by showing a QR-Code to the machine or the machine prints a paper wallet. Finally the machine hopefully does a regular bitcoin transaction to the address.
Getting fiat out of the machine is more complicated and not as fast since the atm would have to wait for confirmations of the transaction and also hold fiat money in the machine. The atm in Berlin provides some other way for that (see link above).

Maybe read more than the title then? What you're proposing is far from what op suggested.

Nice article! It's good to explain fiat first before explaining btc.

The bacteria converts gold chloride to gold. So you still need gold chloride.
I have no idea how scarce gold chloride is, but concluding that gold will be unlimited is pretty bold.

Why would you need that? The cashier would just use the private key to send its asigned value to a wallet of the store. It doesn't matter if 100 other people know the private key at that point. If the cashier is first the store gets the btc.

Let me break it down for you:
A private key is 256bits "long". (256 places with either a 1 or a 0) Therefore to store it you need 32Bytes (256/8).
The amount of all possible private keys is 2^256.
To store all of them you only need 32*(2^256) Bytes, which in decimal is:
 3,450,873,173,395,281,893,717,377,931,138,512,726,225,554,486,085,193,277,581,262,111,899,648 Terrabyte.
For one thing, there is not enough money in the world to buy the required hard drives..

I think that's a great idea! Everyone can print paper wallets and the format doesn't even matter for this use case. As long as the private key is readable by a machine (i.e. qr code) this could be really convenient.
To summarize this in my own terms, you would need a machine that could:
1. Scan+import (edit: transmit to other adress) one or several private key(s) into a wallet, while checking it's assigned value.
2. Calculate change.
3. Print receipt with change on it, which is yet another paper wallet.
It's as easy and convenient as cash! Print your own cash!

But it easily could. With a 1Mbit upload rate, which is standard even in countries like the Philippines, 30seconds allow you to upload 1 MB almost 4 times, which is plenty. However in principle you only need to upload it to one honest node with a faster connection who will spread it for you.
The nice thing about getting started is that you don't do it all the time.

When you say limited resources do you mean transactions?
Couldn't a miner just create as many (zero fee) transactions as needed to fill their block?
I actually lean towards this proposal but since that potential issue was brought up it's bugging me now.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:34:51
You are assuming that everyone would have only a 1Mbit upload speed. The average should be much higher.
Also it wouldn't be "or" in your scenario but "and".
According to speedtest.net the average upload speed in the US was 18.88Mbit/s. Testmy.net says that: In the EU it is 11Mbit/s, in Russia 8.5Mbit/s, Canada 6.8Mbit/s. And that's already more than 70% of the nodes. So surely most hops happen much much faster.
You only need to download the entire history once. It's not something that should happen very often.

Just curious. Are you outside Metro Manila? In the province even? No cable internet options?

The maximum blocksize (currently 1MB) limits how many transactions can be included in a block and therefore confirmed. A new block is generated (or found or solved) every 10 minutes.
The amount of transactions that occur in the bitcoin network every 10 minutes is getting very close to this limit.
A simple solution would be to increase this limit to let's say 2MB..
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:58:24
The community might split somehow but the chain won't, at least not for long.
Miners running BU will only increase the block size if they have an overwhelming majority like 80%. 
They first would have to get there which is difficult at least.
After that they will communicate their intentions of increasing the block size long in advance so small block miners can react in whatever way they wish.
At this point some more miners might flip following their own economic interest. Whatever is left without the upgrade will have super long block times and therefore only a fraction of the capacity it has now. Transaction fees will spike up even more.
Then the majority chain will either die or hard fork their difficulty. What will remain couldn't possibly be called Bitcoin anymore.

The bank of England calls Bitcoin a "key technological innovation"
.. is what I take away from the article.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:58:53
How will you fit that many transactions into a single block?
