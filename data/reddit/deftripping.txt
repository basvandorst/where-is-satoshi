Aye. I see.
You're welcome :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:03:16
Erm. I think it does for the people operating within that exchange.
And what exactly do you mean by 'closed quarantined exchange'? Mind elaborating?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:03:35
And how do you back that?
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:05:14
It's there in Bitcoin vs INR option, after hitting the + button on the top right.
Has two exchanges 'Quoine' I guess and the other is 'coinsecure'.
This one is more active.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:18:41
True. But what frightens me is the prospect that they hold to wreck the entire chain.
And this is not the first time I'm coming across this plan. This is the 2nd time. First time I saw this when someone over here did a translation from posts in a chinese discussion forum.
It miners can plan with exchanges behind closed doors, they sure as well can do this.
**And S2X is not the real Trojan Horse.** It is just a bullet in BTC chain to maim and cripple it. BCash was the fallback and the main plan all along. This is what I feel.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:20:56
I see. Valid point.
Thanks for quelling my fears.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:44:23
Those are the Tethered up guys :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:44:33
Yea. I have my fingers crossed.
Could you do me a favor and tell me where are the current supports for BTC/USD?
I see a huge sell wall beyond 6050 on Bitfinex :|
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:38:37
I see.
Um, say if what if the miners in coalition are able to do what is proposed in the open letter.
Which ways do think Bitcoin will be able to sustain through/circumvent this attack?
Thanks for taking the time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:54:10
Na lol
I mean as in the price support. Was it at 5.5K?
Thanks for the info :D
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:07:05
Just my two cents I feel BTG tries to act as a test ground and work towards this.
Moreover these things to be ASIC proof or there should be competition in the ASIC industry.
Because monopoly of these things this makes Miners more rich and powerful than the ordinary community/users.
They can form a coalition with some really big HODLers and push the price like this.
Anyway, do you think this will swing more? I feel Jihan and Co. are just taking a breather. They broke/exhausted the support/buy orders at ~5800$.
Maybe time for next move :/
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:21:53
Oh. I get it.
But it means something to me since I invested in BTC in my currency, INR and if and when I do cash out, it'll be in INR.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:36:52
But as far as I have seen this world/system has a propensity to favor the evil/corrupt.
I'm just riding the waves. I lost quite a bit today. Had put some of my portfolio in BCH to extend my BTC and was planning to cash out soon. Want to buy a drumming kit.
Lost a handful :/
Let's see.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:51:21
I see. Will it affect the Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:47:01
Rising again! 70B$+ market cap ��
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:26:22
Will running a 0.15.0+ node help in the No2X movement?
Also I'm wondering.
I'm a student. And had some money on my hands and invested said money in Bitcoin.
Would it be wise to leave it there? It is in a safe place for now.
Or should I rather withdraw it?
Sorry for this dumb question.
Thank you.

As far as Chinese miners go. In the vein of my post, I think each country, instead of setting up own cryptocurrency could instead set up/fund mining hardware and operations; along with obvious regularisation/AML/KYC implementation.
This would strengthen the trustlees and decentralisation of Bitcoin.
But these are just my musings. No one would give a duck.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:28:52
Would issuing such cryptocurrency, steal value away form BTC? I don't understand you. Sorry.
Please explain it to me.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:11:22
I have coins on Electrum on TAILS.
Is that safe? :|
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:20:29
I see. I did read about this.
Can someone validate this?
Is the BTC.com wallet reliable, as in it seems to me that the private keys and the seed are in my hand. But I could be mistaken. Please guide.
Thanks a ton :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:41:12
I bought in after the BCH split ;-;
Edit: why the downvotes ��
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:26:25
But I has only limited monies. Say I can purchase only 20,000 INR worth of Bitcoin more :(
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:48:07
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:26:00
What is EDA? O.o
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:03:32
I see.
I'm just a college student who invests a bit every now and then in BTC. And thus hardware wallets are out of question for me.
Anyhow. Thanks a ton :D
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:18:44
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:53:44
I see. I'm a college student so can't really afford a hardware wallet. Am looking into paper wallets as we speak currently.
Hmmm. Yes. I get the general hang of it.
But why not Electrum on Linux. Isn't it supposedly more secure, than windows and mobile wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:31:10
That's sickeningly true. Man I hate how this world works. How people with the littlest of power get all authorisation and corrupt.
***Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.***
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:33:32
Think they already did. Those holding on will continue to do so, because maybe it's not a blanket ban.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:49:51
When is the China Bitcoin ban going to be implemented? Is it the 30th of September?
What do you think, will the price of Bitcoin fall then?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:32:56
That's good :')
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:47:19
Thank you so much! :D
I bought coins for all of it. During a minor dip in the price.
Kinda happy about it. Thank you u/Hodl_dodge.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:51:38
I get it. Thanks man.
And yes, totally agree with you on the govt cryptos vs BTC and like.
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:07:45
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:43:32
I see. I see. Thank you for taking the time and answering my queries.
BCash is bound to fail anyway. It was just an attempt to divert and make money out a bitcoin alt. Still is being propagated for the same purposes.
Anyhow that is all political stuff, and I would rather not indulge.
Thanks once again :)
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:31:58
So is how is the beneficial/detrimental to the miners?
And what is EDA an acronym for?
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:40:28
Helps A LOT! Thank you so much :)
