So how many Satoshis is  0.73 BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:44:35
Tried that link. Its weird. Changes values when I dont want it to. Put in my income, expenses and savings and the savings rate flips around the place like craxy. Cant change it back to 2% before it changes other values. Nice idea but not working for me.

Thanks for your hard work (haven’t watched it yet). Any plans to make a more accessible 2-3min version / explainer?

Just logged in now and its screwed up for me too. Do I have to wait for the whole screen to fill before its fixed? Are Coinbase trying to "erase their dirty history?"
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:44:20
Yeah but getting cash into Coinbase is a problem. Deposited on 20th Dec. Still not shown up in my Coinbase Euro account. ��

Why didn't the order go through?

Ask your employer to pay you in BTC via Bitwage. ����

Very difficult not to leave a digital print, no matter how long ago you first typed  on a computer!
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:05:39
As long as you don’t have to share your tips with your other staff!
@_date: 2018-10-31 17:46:34
That’s what I thought!
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:09:12
Just wondering if anyone has a link to the  really good BBC documentary about Silk Road, Ross and his capture? 
I’m sure I saved it to my favourites but can’t find it now. Probably taken down by YouTube. A DTube version would be awesome. ��

Giggidy giggidy!

Plot twist:
She is actually a He!

Should the text not say guess what it will be in 2020?
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:59:28
Is that all that Peter Schiff does?
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:04:03
This is great. But I tried scanning that code with my phone as a QR code and also with BRD wallet app &amp; nothing happens. Is it my phone or is this not a real QR code?
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:26:30
Anyone noticed how quickly that price flashed up on the screen during the presentation? Must’ve been less than 1 second.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:38:57
He’s probably just going to bake a “Spotted Dick“ (which is a British fruit pudding) and eat that Live on TV instead. That’s how I’d get out of it anyway. ��
@_date: 2019-02-03 18:15:08
Hefty commission probably. And maybe education classes?
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:51:20
We do know Hal was Satoshi. Don’t we?
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:32:34
Or it could just be lots of people FOMO bought during the bubble and are still HODLING? 
@_date: 2019-01-27 18:58:32
About $2.50 worth? ;)

Put a small amount into BTC around May 2017. It’s all the other shitty Alt coins I bought that I regret. �� Still don’t regret buying the BTC though 
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:22:39
What do you mean by "batch it"?
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:29:40
Is that a normal shit split in two by a wedgie?  (��|��)   ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:06:09
That’s the end of human civilisation part

So is Etherium totally screwed or should we see a resurge after Aug 1st?
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:12:43
Dont you wish you bought in at 700 now?
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:31:16
Thought I put a sell order in but looks like it was never instigated. Managed to buy on the dip.
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:30:24
Or worst. Just sayin’
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:27:03
Wow. Who would have guessed it? ��
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:28:27
And remember. They said five “short“ years. Not five normal years!
@_date: 2019-05-06 10:15:39
Interesting. Received 7 BTC in total.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:20:14
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:37:30
Well if a crypto website says it, it must be true
