Use circle or coinbase.

So 55% haven't upgraded.
With more contentious changes less uptake again is more likely. 
We could be in for some volatility in the exchange rate.

Only thirty percent of nodes were running 0.11 last time I checked.
Fewer will likely take up 0.12 as the network ossifies further.
So I am struggling to see why you think there would be 70% uptake in six months. 
There is little functional difference to rendering 70% of the network obsolete as nodes unable to validate segwit transactions and performing a hard fork which potentially loses a % of laggard nodes to a dying rump chain. 
In fact both require as much of the network as possible to upgrade.
A series of 'backwards compatible' soft forks like we have had to was IMO a huge mistake.

If a fee market arrives with an artificial cap on transaction numbers then fees could rise to any level. 
So not bogus at all. In fact extremely possible although demand to use bitcoin would shrivel up (along with the exchange price) once it becomes public that fees are prohibitively expensive due to a capacity problem.

Because they don't agree clearly.

1) the turmoil could be stopped if Core simply added a blocksize increase at a fixed date to the roadmap.
2) if demand for block chain transactions doubles from here then nearly half of those transactions will fail.

They are angry at Core developers changing the economics driving bitcoin by introducing an artificial fee market and transaction cap.

A year or so? Try before the halving.

Bitcoin did just fine before Maxwell and would be great without him. It is bigger than one person.
Incidentally the cryptography driving bitcoin was worked out completely in 2009. Bitcoin doesn't need cryptographers. All that is left now is optimisation.

They are. Look up.
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:02:48
They are angry because certain people at the heart of development are deliberately allowing us to hit this transaction cap (which was introduced as a temporary cludge) and by inaction changing the basic economics of bitcoin.

51% attack? Nodes are free to run whatever they like.
Strange way to look at a natural phenomenon. The market will run the bitcoin they want and it will be bitcoin. If the economic majority wants something different to what Core offers then they will choose another implementation. 
No need for hero worship or appeals to authority because they don't work outside this subreddit.
Bitcoin is decentralised and the most run implementation has and always be up to the whims of those who run validating nodes or mine. With the ultimate say over the rules of bitcoin falling on the humble holder or investor who can take away their support and sink the currency to worthlessness if it does not respond to the market.
Maxwell today on discusses raising the blocksize when transaction fees are 50cents. I'd say there is some divergence appearing..

In fact a serious investor would very much examine monetary inflation prior to stepping into the market, so the halving is highly relevant in that context.
16 year olds? Really? Bitcoin has a multi billion dollar market cap.

I'd rather hedge on fixing our scalability problems without waiting for the actual transport layer of the network to break down-- that would be a very sad day.
The two should not be mutually exclusive. Only one group suggests they are. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 19:00:10
It is artificial. For all the years since inception in 2009 bitcoin has organically grown blocks with demand. Now for the first time we have an upper bound to the blocksize which is close to being reached.
Once that occurs persistently there will be (until bitcoin demand drops) transactions that simply cannot fit leading to erratic transactions, laggy confirmations and a bidding war for seats at the bus.
No point pretending otherwise.
