Why the ! has no one commented yet? I am getting my CaVirtex acct getting verified at the moment. Have you tried this method yet? I was immediately going to invest with the Maximiser for short and long term trends, as I firmly believe BTC will reach 1,000,000+. But for the near future: the Closing Price went outside the Bollinger Bands in mid October for more days than usual AND the short term EMA is still below the long term EMA when the short is almost always above the long.
Can you please describe the experience trading with the Maximiser at Coinarch? I just started learning about trading last week. But I've been following Bitcoin since Max Keiser has so it's perfect timing IMO with this Maximiser. They learned a lot from Andreas Antononopolous!;)

This link shows you the partnerships this CEO formed with already existing companies, therefore it is not a scam.
There website has all the info you need on binary options.
I am a huge advocate of this website and have been using them for months and it has changed my life.

That's why I asked about the "world" after because using the word "industry" was a mistake. 
But you're answer assumes that the other 6, out of 7, billion ppl in the world has access to banking like you and I do. When in reality the vast majority rely on their cellphone to do commerce.

And idk why you're mentioning securing the network, I never asked about that. But I do appreciate your opinion on which "space" will be focused on by the world in the near future. Ty

What do you see the world focusing on more in the near future? Bitcoin related tech, or Blockchain?

Need to use your seed plus passphrase for SW. Use Ian Coleman tool and if the passphrase and seed are correct, the balance will be on the addresses listed.

lol you're such a FUDster. Get a life. If you ever contact support instead of spewing nonsense like a child with DYOR, or check out other threads on Twitter, you'll find out that it's simply a display issue and there is always a fix.

This is literally an exact copy of Greg Maxwell's reply on another thread on Reddit. You didn't even quote and give a reference... you are an NPC.  
u/PurpleShizzle it sounds like a display issue, contact support

Not true for localbitcoins.com , paxful.com, etc. p2p exchanges are best imo and it's not hard at all. And yes your rates sound nice now but what about when the price is going up or down, do you change it? How will ppl know you've changed it? They don't know, they just see BTC prices for what you say it's worth (so markups included). Correct me if I'm wrong plz.
Edit: just watched your video, ya don't say it's becoming hard to get involved. It's easy with LBC. If you don't spread misinformation ppl will spread the word about your service but if you're not 100% truthful some ppl won't spread the word. You make it seem like the network has more problems then it really has. No need to do that just for your business. Not good long term.

I tried the Booster. Honestly, I didn't feel I understood it well enough to profit from. The Booster is easier to use.
