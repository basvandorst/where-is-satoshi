Knowing the salt itself doesn't really add much information when you consider that they need the code to determine how the salt is applied to the password.
e.g. sha(sha(password) + sha(salt)) or any number of combinations. Apparently bitcointalk was using a ton of rounds. Point is, they need the code anyways if they plan to crack passwords, and if they have the code they know which columns to use.

You literally can't generate rainbow tables for salted passwords. You'd be generating a new one for every unique password/salt combination. No one would do this, they'd just brute force it.
Here's what the db looks like:
    | password   | salt (random 12 byte string)           |
    | password 2 | different salt (random 12 byte string) |
The password is too long to effectively use a rainbow table. They can just try to brute force each password given the known salt.

Bitstamp doesn't do ACH withdrawals, only International Wire Transfers. Does Camp BX do ACH withdrawals?
I can't find any exchange that does ACH withdrawals (directly or through an intermediary) or check withdrawals or any decent USD withdrawal (Amazon, gift card, prepaid card) other than a $1k minimum wire transfer withdrawal.

Thanks for the link. I don't agree with all he is saying, but he presents the argument in an intelligent manner.
For instance, in his argument about the assumption of government land ownership he dismisses it as circular in that the government would need control of the land to gain political authority. But this isn't circular. A government does not need ownership of the land to be a political authority, and indeed I could imagine a government which has political authority but not ownership of the land. The people could vest political authority in a government without necessarily ceding land ownership as well, and that government would then have political authority.

There could be opt-in governments. We don't currently have one though. And I think everyone is aware of that.
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:11:19
In your view, should government be an opt-in situation, where I can choose to not pay any dues if I want, but still live on the land here?

Do you only pay capital gains taxes when it's converted back to dollars? What if you never exchange them back to dollars?
And does sales tax apply to goods or services exchanged for bitcoins?

Unless you are using a site for transaction processing, like for a shopping cart on your website, you should not be storing any money in web wallets. It's just asking for people to steal from you, whether the owners of the site or the people that hacked the site.
You can easily generate your own wallets using any of the dozen or so different clients. My favorite is Electrum. Another fun site to use is [bitaddress.org]( which works with Electrum.
If you are depositing a lot of money, you need to get even more high tech. What if your computer has a keylogger? Look into things like offline transaction processing, and using live CD distros.

A lot of these ideas are currently up to the private business or person to protect the privacy of others. e.g. merchants should only store data long enough to fulfill a transaction.
Another aspect of this would be requiring that customer information be encrypted both in storage and transmission. I think the Silk Road after-effects are showing what a serious problem there can be when customer information is sent in the clear to merchants.

Me saying you agree to it does not mean you want it to be so, nor that I want it to be so. What I mean is that it is not "stealing" because these things are discussed beforehand and you aren't forced to live here. I don't like that people try to shift the conversation into this false "stealing"/"extortion" realm. If you have serious concerns about the tax law, that's something worth discussing. But jumping to say that it's "stealing" or "extortion" is just absurd.
People are told they are going to have to pay taxes to continue living here. Now you could question the legitimacy of any government, but let's not pretend it's some great surprise or wrongdoing when the government you know is in place is going to demand you pay taxes in the coming year.
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:07:55
I agree with everything you said.
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:02:43
I enjoy seeing well-formed arguments like those; however, I'd say that I don't agree with them as a workable ideology.
I don't usually upvote people in the same thread as me, but you've received one from me.
This strikes at much deeper questions about governments, and whether or not they should even exist. It's sort of another argument entirely, and I think it would be disingenuous to try to apply it to specific laws without applying it as a whole.
The Edgar video is an unbelievably naive take on economics. I can't even believe someone made that video.

Taxes are now extortion? Hah.
Every developed country I know of has taxes and provides social safety nets like welfare and medical care.
No one is forcing you to live in a country that doesn't leave its senior citizens to fend for themselves. On the contrary, you are free to leave. But if you want to live here, then you have to accept that we care about our senior citizens and want them to receive medical care. I want that to be how our country works, and most of the people here agree that they want their country to work that way.
It's **you** who are trying to force your insane ideas on the rest of us, not the other way around.

I don't believe he thinks he is basing his argument on semantics, and I don't believe I am basing mine on it either. Ownership of land is not necessary for political authority if you can imagine a government that has authority but not ownership.
It's not at all oversimplified. The problem is using a broad argument (government's authority to exist) to argue a minute detail (taxes). If you want to argue the government's authority to exist, that's one thing. But you can't ignore that major consequence and use it to argue against taxes.

Nope. You agree to pay taxes. You may not agree that you should have to pay taxes, but you do agree to pay them.

You have a say in the decision, there's other countries in the world, and you are free to move to one. So I don't agree that it is compulsory since you are free to leave.

I never use those Instant verifications; however, they are quite common and not really shady. Lots of online financial stuff use it. Mint.com, PayPal, and a few others I can't remember use it.
What I find more annoying is the PATRIOT ACT Social Security Number verification information. I remember signing up for Dwolla and it pulled up all this detailed information about names of people I've lived with and places I've lived and places that people I lived with live and what their birth dates were. All on Dwolla's site, provided to them by Big Brother.
