This is the perfect relationship for Monero as the Ransomware coin.  
1. Install Ransomware - Ask for $1000 in Monero
2. Person goes to Coinbase to get $1000 in Bitcoin
3. Person sends BTC to Shapeshift for Monero to Ransom address
4. Ransom Monero gets exchanged for Bitcoin

Coinbase’s fiduciary responsibility is to its Shareholders/Investors and by adding Bitcoin Cash it distributes the fork coins along with allows more trading fees.  
If you are a user demanding SegWit it would only become a priority for them if enough users leave their platform, not everyone cares about anything but having a place to trade.  Which is more valuable to them traders on Coinbase or people demanding a wallet they are not using.

R3 and bankcoins make sense to me in the regards that it will quicken the pace of transfers and reporting and possibly increase the banks profitability.  Have you ever tried to wire transfer $50,000 it costs $50 and is a pain in the ass.
R3 will have a place in blockchaining a bankcoin as long as people here continue to think that buying a coffee is not a bitcoin issue.
You cant have both a daily currency coin and small blocks.  One thing has to change, now does R3 use Blockstream technology on top of their bankcoins remain to be seen and we embrace R3 or we look towards real scalability.
Note - I own Bitcoin, Bank shares publically traded and Bank shares privately traded (SUB S Corp).  Either way I want the banks to be more efficient and make me more money.

Bruce - 
Since the Foundation's decision to concentrate mainly on code and with the recent publicity win that Bitpay had with the Bitcoin Bowl do you see th DC lobbying group be unfunded and more education be placed on the companies around Bitcoin?  One reason I ask is one of your opponents for a board seat is a paid member of this group.
I would like to know your thoughts with these 2.0 companies and if the Foundation's goal is code for Bitcoin should we stop supporting things like Ethereum who are perceived competition  and only support Bitcoin code type projects like Blockstream.

GLD is the primary ETF that COIN is following because Bitcoin acts most like Gold, and GLD has been quite successful.  
COIN will be traded on Nasdaq if approved and my guess is less than 100 people who read this reddit forum will have significant funds in it.  Because it requires  cash assets or 401k money which is actually hard to get into COIN.
COIN will also become the pricing mechanism for BTC.
If you dont like COIN then keep your BTC private keys on you.  If you want to buy/sell COIN on a highly liquid exchange as Nasdaq knowing that your money is some what unprotected but do know that SEC has some legal enforcement.

The question you are not asking is which major company will provide insurance over this digitial commodity (~1% of Bitcoin Market Cap) right now and how much will it cost?
And is the cost of insurance something as a COIN buyer would want to haves in more fees for holding this ETF.
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:59:37
Yes but still smart enough to pick up 200k BTC for an ETF and holding X amount of personal coins.
The higher the price is in USD prior to ETF release the more USD they will make (Sales Price of ETF - purchase price less than $25 a coin), and then run the ETF with fees.
Even though they seem isolated they are not hurting.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:34:09
My thoughts as a regular Joe investor 
1) Double size when 25% of blocks per day exceed 1mb limit (or in the future the doubled amount)
2) Miner fees should never be more than $0.10 USD per basic transaction, 3rd world countries this is an issue.  If this means off the bock transactions by a national provider like Coinbase or a regional sidechain on bitcoin at a pegged rate -  I dont care how just make it work
3) Bitcoin is the only smart money asset in crypto, imo.  Fuck Ether and the rest of the alts, concentrate on making bitcoin work, otherwise I will use the Banks version of Ripple to move USD Assets in the future as I think most of the population of the world will agree.
Just quit making this shit harder for the everyday person.

My $GBTC "tree" is me and 5 others who used Retirement 401k Money in places like Fidelity to buy $GBTC, I think all are in at $35 or under and all are HODLing.
Note: The retirement money I was able to use on this was previous employment rollover funds.
My retirement money options for this is to buy $GBTC at a premium or cash it our pay 35% taxes on it along with a 10% penalty (since I am under 55) then buy actual bitcoins to hold at my house, for now $GBTC is the way to go and if I sell I don't have to pay Capital gains now only trading fees. This is why $GBTC is at a premium until a large scale ETF is available and even then I figure a premium though small will be there.

I see nothing wrong with this in much sense the Core has their development plan as does Classic.   
Classic is 1 - go to 2 MB 2- work in SegWit after its tested and let it add the 1.3-2X to get to 3.6-4MB.
Taariq is right the thing that is driving Classic is communication with users, companies and such other than just the Devs.

Thing is with bitcoin you can vote write code and if people dont like it then it wont get accepted (Mined).
And then a fork fixing the issue and why Classic is picking up steam now, the Core stance with Seg Wit as a SF and no immediate change in 1 MB is pushing people away.

I understand you have a fiduciary requirement to your investors, I have a fiduciary requirement to my savings only.  And in my savings I want to use Bitcoin and not a sidechain, I want to use Bitcoin to buy coffee without a 3rd party and have a store of value and to do both, and my best chance of this in the future is for showing Core they are the only ones who matter, while doing it with code I do support, which is 11.0.2 but would need to expand the blocks I've limit.
The market price of Bitcoin will fix itself, If one cannot handle this flutation they need to hedge their position.
I have never supported XT.
I support a 2MB limit submitted and done today followed by SegWit, LN or sidechains, which is all encompassing as we work to scale more in the future if we need to.  But having a Core who is unwilling to come to partisan negotiations a forum and reddit thread who sensors and this is what you get. You can thank theymos, btcdrk for that.

@_date: 2016-01-17 01:44:14
Also Luke asked incorrectly by going straight to github instead of using slack where things are being discussed and bitcoinconsider.it.
This is one of my issues with Core, I don't code so I don't Github so if I go to Core and bring something up I am just ignored.  Classic is doing the one thing Core and Hearn did not do look at users concerns.
I want a 2MB now and working to Seg Wit and I feel most interested in Classic for now would agree, but because 50 core coders disagree, us regular users are fucked.
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:35:47
The most logical developer we have is Garzik, he is the one I wish was lead.  As long as he is willing to work on a project like Classic that is where my support will be unless Core implements 2MB now and works towards SegWit
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:04:16
No there can be multiple sets of developers on multiple bitcoin clients.
Core, Classic and Unlimited - they also can cross work on all.  Core has become centralizied and many feel they are not listening to anyone but Blockstream.
This extreme displeasure would all go away if they went to 2MB, I have not heard 1 reasonable argument why they havent.  I support SegWit but to think it's going to be in by halving is insane, a bump to 2MB would prevent issues for probably a year, 3MB pushes China's Internet issues for miners.
What Classic has done is talked to users then tring to engineer, that's part of Cores issue.
