Hmm and what options do you have if you lose the treznor?
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:49:24
Yes, but A) that specifically states it’s not really an issue if you encrypted your wallet, and B) I read things like this and worry about all solutions:  
I do understand that computers can be key logged obviously, which defeats the whole password encryption thing.

Problem that I experienced was selling, and thinking I'd buy back in at a lower price, but it never goes back down to that lower price. My resulting thought is - okay, well I'm just going to want to reinvest if I sell, so instead I'll just hold. Trying to sell high and buy low is amazing if you do it right, but if you fuck it up, you lose a lot.

HAHA my bad

Thank you, that chart is what I was looking for.
One question - when people write on here to expect miners to switch to BCH temporarily, is that due to a BTC difficulty increase or is it due to a BCH difficulty decrease?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:27
That would be a what.. 35% drop? They would definitely say it’s dead. Lol

Thank you for all of this... I'm a bit confused on something though. Say you buy $10k worth of bitcoins on an exchange. The price of BTC rises a ton, and you end up with $100k worth of bitcoins. Then, you sell to USD on the exchange and then buy alt currencies. Everything then tanks, and you end up back at $10k. Then you sell. This all happens within the same tax period.
You would pay no taxes, correct? Because, at the end of the day, you didn't profit...
Just wondering if there's some weird way to get screwed on this.

I've seen a lot of phishing sites as the 1st paid result on Google lately..
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:53:06
I just had a similar experience. It's really making me believe in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:55:08
Interesting. Okay.. good to know... some posters were saying that you have to disable auto-connect in Electrum, etc etc.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:05:32
I was just getting my BCH wallet going using the private keys from my BTC, and that's all good now. So I have my BTC in Electrum, and my BCH in Electron. However, I noticed on Bitfinex and a few other sites that there is another thing called BCC - 'Bitcoin Core' I believe... and it's price is different to BTC and BCH. It's dollar value is roughly $3.1k at the moment. Is this yet another fork? If so, I should have the same funds as my BTC and BCH, no?
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:28:04
Lol not new, just curious because last time everyone's explanation was that it was too small of a population using bitcoin so it was very volatile. Now it's not a small population.

Wait when you say Google Auto Sign In, do you mean Google’s autofill password feature or are you referring to some third party plugin?
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:14:13
Dude delete this post, why didn’t you use a throwaway!? what are you doinggggg
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:48:05
Interesting. Okay, but is there any risk in post-fork sending my BTC to another wallet, and then making a S2X wallet and sweeping the old wallet keys?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:09:09
It's a solid company, but I suggest using GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) because you will spend WAY less in fees.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:39:22
Just get an account on GDAX and buy through them. It's Coinbase's exchange, US-based, trustworthy. Buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:22:21
Wait - step  is on the BTC side, so that transaction couldn't be replayed on the BTC side since it already happened, and therefore you can't lose your BTC... no? I can see how step  could be replayed on the S2X chain..
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:54:15
yeah. crap. i saw it flying up and thought surely the news is so fresh that it'll spike more in the next few hours... threw a good chunk of change in.. anddddd falling.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:08:23
Wouldn’t that be a targeted attack? Or could someone do this at random?
And this would affect only the s2x side and not the Btc side?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:52:41
Whoa. Okay. Ty!
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:29:54
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:57:49
i know... been in the game since 2012.. just bummed that i called that so wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:48:11
Yeah exactly, I don’t understand the benefit.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:07:01
Problem is, multibit (at least the version I'm using) doesn't allow me to change the fee. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:43:09
Wait yeah why did btc-e not move with the other exchanges? Is something wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:52:52
For those who are hurting right now - I had steadily invested all the way up from $120 and then when it hit $1200 the first time, I put in $20k. The next morning China banned it, everything tanked. But I held, and a few years later, everything is awesome..
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:36:39
I know they've been under market but normally it follows the other markets relatively... but I watched btc-e and unless I read it wrong, it seemed it stayed at like 1370 while other markers went from 1450 to 1600..
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:22:44
I’m sorry, what is a mnemonic extension? I always thought the phrase covers the recovery 
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:39:11
Okay but I've read that small enough fees = indefinite waiting. Is that not true?
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:05:22
Wait, what does this mean though? Just that tax isn't charged for direct purchasing of services/products using bitcoin, right? Buying/selling BTC on exchanges will still be taxed yeah?
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:40:20
Fair enough - I'd rather stick to software though... I know electrum uses central servers... could you recommend software that doesn't?
