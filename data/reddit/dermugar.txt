It's about the perspective. There also were people that were happy that atomic bombs exist and on the other hand there were the citizen of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

I'm from germany and registered via my ID. I can't trade on gdax (which belongs to coinbase) without registering another identification-piece. If I choose my german drivers ID, it gets rejected.

I'm working with Seelen für Seelchen e. V. (a german charity) which translates roughly to Souls for little Souls.
They're helping romanian street dogs to get over to germany and austria, to start a live within families. In the last year there were hundrets of dogs saved by this organization, and they're working with a small team of volunteers to give nearly all the money to shelters in romania. Currently they're setting up a "free shelter" to give a home to dogs, that aren't able to travel to germany (due to laws i. e.), where they can life a good life in groups.
If they get a chance to get one of the BTC, I'd happily manage the exchange with them, like helping them to start a temporary wallet and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:55:31
yep, germany. Thank you for your kind words :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:54:51
germany. And within the last days I was one of the guys, who was checking the balance every few seconds. I'm quite happy with todays price :D

I hope everything turns out good for you and that you get better results in your cryptoinvestments soon.
I'returning the offer to you (and anyone who's reading this thread), if you have the need to talk, hit me up. Sometimes it's easier to speak free to complete strangers than to friends :)

two things I'd like to see in this:
- It should save the amount of bitcoin I tiped in when I refresh. So I don't have to type in my current amount of BTC in everytime I visit
- In the "price ticker"-mode it should say the current value also as a page-title so you don't have to switch you tabs to see the current value
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:08:47
I wish you all the best for that. And for a significant price-jump in btc. which helps you (totally without throwing an eye at my wallet, of course ;) :D)

If the worth rises you may change it back into more $ than you spent.
If the worth falls you may loose every $ you spent.
It's like you were asking "can you still make money with apple stocks" at @_date: 2019-06-13 14:18:30
putting it down to a fraction of a bitcoin may solve many questions, since many people don't know about satoshis/that you can buy fractions of a bitcoin.

Hey there!
* you should only invest what you can affort to loose
* nobody can tell you for sure, if it's a good point to start your investment. There are indicators that speak for further raising courses and there are indicators that speak for a "crash". 
* the best place to start with bitcoin seems to be coinbase.com, since it's easy to use
* BCH is BCash, a Bitcoin fork

whatever you can afford to loose completly. It's worth is rising, but it isn't a guaranteed money-printing-machine.
If you can't afford to loose money, you better don't invest it. In this case it's just like the classic stock-market.

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:10:51
well... it depends on how everything is evolving. Bitcoin made a huge step foreward this year, by adding more than 1.100% to it's wort. 
It could gain another thousands within 2018, it could stay at 10k per BTC or it could crash and become basically worthless as it was just a few years ago.

as long as I can buy a whole dinner for my family one day and a slice of bread the other with the same amount it's an investment. It needs to stabilize to function as a currency - no matter how often it's named a currency in this sub.

there are vpn-services. The most people that are tech-savvy enough to own bitcoin, are able to use a vpn.
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:24:20


there is absolutely NO guarantee this will happen. Of course we all hope for this, but if it would hold it's today-value bitcoin reached what it is made for - a currency instead of an investment.
Please don't tell kids that buying bitcoin is a free ticket to wealth in the future.

I'm working with people that still don't get email at all. They can send mails, they can receive mails. They can't setup outlook/thunderbird/mail/etc. they don't know that adresses aren't case-sensitive and so on. Understanding bitcoin/email/other things isn't a binary 1 or 0-thing
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:14:57


which will cost them all their integrity and in worst case their channel, since the people wouldn't rely on their videos anymore. Seems like a solid idea.
