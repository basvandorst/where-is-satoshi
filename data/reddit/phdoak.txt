All the explanations you have been given so far are not correct. This is a tweet about the XBTUSD contract on Bitmex which is the Perpetual Swaps Contract. This contract never settles which is why its called a "Perpetual Contract" (there is no strike price or settlement date) and its price is based on Bitmex's index price which is made up of prices on GDAX and Bitstamp.
Bitmex also offers up to 100x leverage which means that best case scenario someone took a short position on this contract with $23,000 at 100x leverage. The price went up in a such a way that would cause them to lose more than this 23,000 and so their position was liquidated (forced to close, in this case by buying) by Bitmex's risk engine.
These contracts have been trading on Bitmex for a long time and this is not even a big liquidation for them. These types of liquidations are happening constantly which you can see by reviewing the rest of the posts from this twitter account. The way these contracts work it is impossible to get liquidated in a short position if you are not using leverage. This means that there is 0% chance that this person actually lost $2.3M. They were using leverage and lost a significantly smaller amount of money.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in crypto. Its an incredible read that talks mostly about big trends in history, so it isn't specific to crypto currency, but the authors do predict that inventions like bitcoin will come about and that they will have a huge impact on the world so it does take up a lot of the book. Again this book was written in 1999 so keep that in mind.

I'm sorry for your loss and I really do not want to rub this in but as a PSA for others reading this you could have been saved if you would have double spent yourself with much higher fees. In this case the low fees would have saved you, what you should have done was create another transaction for the same bitcoins with an extremely high fee that would be guaranteed to be confirmed in one block and sent those coins to another address that you controlled. That way by the time the "hacked" coins got confirmed 65 hours later the transaction would no longer be valid and you wouldn't have lost them.

It is based purely on what people are willing to exchange for it. For example 
Price is always a reflection of market sentiment about what something is worth i.e. it is based on human emotion in all cases which is why it is in a state of perpetual fluctuation. There is no such thing as a true price for something.

What people seem to forget is that Bitcoin exists because people wanted it. There was a real market demand for it that inspired people to work on the problem for decades. This is counter to pretty much all other forms of money (besides gold) that exist by government edict (i.e. artificial demand).

Agree 100% with this comment and I also will add, when has there ever been a single asset in history that every human in the world had the ability to buy. What does that look like? At the current world population of 7.5M there is only enough bitcoin for every person to own 0.0028 BTC. What happens when 10% of those people hedge 10% of their net worth into it? 
If you were a millionaire why would you not at least hedge 1% of your NW into Bitcoin? What do you have to lose? There are 10 million millionaires in just America. If they all hedged 1% (~10K) then that is (10,000,000) * (10,000) a $100B market cap. If they hedged 10% that would be a $1Trillion cap. There is a lotttttttttt of room to run.

Main reason I see is that consensus is decided by users/miners/devs all together, not any one group. While technically they could implement segwit for it to become consensus they would need the acceptance of the users, 99% of which went to bcash specifically because it doesn't have segwit. Think r/btc would be stoked about segwit on bcash? Doubtful.

Bitcoin is binary, you either own the UTXO or someone else does. There is no such thing as limbo. If your transaction has not been confirmed then you still own that Bitcoin and you can still spend it.

Security in cryptography comes from the fact that complexity increases exponentially as you add digits to numbers (2^n) . You can leverage that same principle with your wallets by dividing your holdings between more than one wallet. This depends on how you store your keys, if you have 10 wallets all stored on the same computer or all written on the same piece of paper then you haven't increased your security at all, but having more than one wallet is generally more secure and good practice.

When conducting a transaction in bitcoin you sign that transaction and submit all of that info into the public (for lack of a better word) so that the public can verify that you really are the owner of that bitcoin (UTXO). If this data is valid then it will be equally valid on any other blockchain using the same UTXO set running the same code, which is what a hard fork is.
So if Bob --&gt; Alice 1BTC on the original chain, anyone can take the signature info from that transaction and make the same transaction on the other chain because the info will be equally valid (same code).
This data is only made public when you conduct a bitcoin transaction on chain (trading on exchanges doesn't count because that is occurring on their own database). If you don't conduct any transaction on the block chain then you have no risk of losing anything. It is also important to note that your bitcoin cant be "stolen" with replay attacks, it just means that any transaction you make on one chain can be mirrored on the other chain, but the sender and the recipient cannot be changed.

Agree completely. China doesn't give two fucks about crypto currency. China does not want their citizens to be able to easily take large amounts of money out of the country. FUD about banning mining is ridiculous, they don't care about that at all. As long as everyone is KYC'd and they control the gates they will be happy.

If you have a design that makes the bolts on the landing gear of a jet 10% stronger you don't put those bolts onto the jet because you have already tested the hell out of everything and you don't want to introduce new variables into a system that has been thoroughly tested without getting a lot of value in the return. 2x is the engineering version of this in the software world. There is really no reason at all technically to implement 2x, Segwit is working and people are getting transactions through with 5sat/B fees. Why would you hardfork the code for a negligible performance improvement that you know is not a long term solution for any problem. You wouldn't... Segwit2x implementation at this point is 100% political.

Preventing them from trading is impossible, but they control fiat electronically and have the ability to 100% make it down. Have no power to stop bitcoin, but they can turn it into a black market which is nothing new for them.

It seems pretty obvious to me at this point that TPTB in china are accumulating very large positions in Bitcoin. No reason to go through these charades if you aren't. If they really had no interest in Bitcoin they would just ban it and be done with it. Games and fake news like this are extremely bullish long term IMO
