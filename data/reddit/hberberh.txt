Article summary:
- Some words about how Bitcoin has performed in the past
- A neutral mention about Bitcoin's volatility 
- 2013 and Mt.Gox
- They interviewed Ingo Fiedler of the University of Hamburg who recommends to invest in Bitcoin carefully as part of a diversified portfolio of different assets and long-term
- They asked Vinny Lingham for a prediction: 3000 dollars (no timeframe mentioned) 
- Main reason for price surge according to Lingham: halvings, interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties
- Fiedler realised that Bitcoin cannot be controlled by governments and says that events in China often impact the Bitcoin price: if the Yuan sucks, Bitcoin is shining
- A mini description of the decentralised nature of Bitcoin
The words "criminals" , "drugs" and "weapons" are mentioned only once in the last two sentences. No word about money laundering.
I almost feel that mainstream media moronism about Bitcoin may be cured soon.

As you said, people would probably move on to another cryptocurrency where provisions are in place that can deal with this kind of monkey business.

So the tax refunds outweigh the administration costs?

It's just the City of Zug that accepts Bitcoin. Nevertheless, great news!

This person trademarked Bitcoin for pretty much everything imaginable... crèches d'enfants. A bitcoin kindergarten? Or chirurgie esthétique. So this guy will give my ear the shape of the bitcoin sign?
