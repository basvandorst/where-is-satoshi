I said China not because the markets themselves are based in China, but because they are mainly CNY, which is,of course, the currency of China. I am an American and I use OkCoin to trade, but like most Americans on these Chinese based sites, I trade using USD. (yes, I know BTC China only trades CNY). As for market manipulation, I don't think it happens as often as you make it sound. But if a market like BTC China was to slightly raise the value, even falsify, it would raise the value on all markets. Sad but true.

Just curious, what it it exactly will you be selling? Is it all one unit or the RpI software? It seems like a really neat tool, good for small businesses that don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy POS terminals. I believe it's little things like this that will bring smaller merchants into the market, and that's what will make the future for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:58:08
Circle and coinbase really just do the same thing, but circle will give you just a *little* more. And yes, you sell when you think the market is at its highest, buy back in at the lowest. Are you looking to buy and sell everyday as a short term investments or like a weekly thing?
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:50:46

@_date: 2015-03-13 22:34:28
yes. It's not something you have to do, it's just what most people do. That way you move your bitcoins and you for-sure have them. Sites that sell BTC aren't made for storage and to be used as an wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:25:15
Does it really matter? It is only one persons opinion. I want to hear what everyone has to say, good or bad, so I can better judge its value

Well, china by far has the most bitcoins, and their second largest market is about to take a shit. I have been using OkCoin for a while now, I loved the trading layout and no trading fees. But a storm is brewing, it's obvious. Anyone that uses OKCoin is in danger.  @_date: 2015-03-11 18:26:54
...no one really has anyway to know that
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:56:26
Well shit, can't beat that. Guess someone already one-upped me lol. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:15:57
I read about it in a few different places. Maybe they are in the process of removing them still, not sure. Just telling you guys what i heard 
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:17:32
I just stopped using OKCoin today. Your Operations Manager, CTO, CCO, Director of International Operations, product designer, and others left for a reason that they won't tell the public. Your company has lied to the public multiple times, including accusations of false changes in market value and order volume. Until your company can justify these public claims, I won't use OKCoin again. And what made you come and post this information all of a sudden? Your company is going and you know it. It's corrupted market owners that are driven by greed that are ruining that chance for bitcoin to become what it should be. I'm sorry but I don't stand for this, your lies and deception ends now.
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:04:43
You really gave us all the information you could. I don't really know what is going on, seems really fishy. Thank god it was such a low amount. I would research that site and see if anyone else got ripped off, maybe there was a minimum fee or something that was missed. I wouldn't blame Bitcoins in general for this (I know you aren't, but this is how a lot of people think). I suggest buying more bitcoins, but this time from a site that is well trusted like coinbase or circle. I use circle because the give you a little bit more for your dollar. After you buy your BTC on one of these sites, it's recommended that you transfer your BTC out to a personal wallet (or a market of your choice). If you need help finding a good market or have anymore questions, feel free to message me anytime. ALWAYS be on the look out for scammers, they love to pray on bitcoin investors.
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:33:01
Use Circle (or coinbase). And I don't see why a prepaid card wouldn't work. But if you are trying to use  different stuff like moneypak and stuff, you're going to have to use localbitcoins. If you're trying to get the most for your money though, circle is your best bet.
@_date: 2015-03-15 03:59:58
Isn't it just a paper wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:46:39
Looks like someone missed a zero when he was selling rofl. It could also be someone selling a little bit to try and scare people into selling (an attempt to drop the market value so they can buy in at a loew price)
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:54:40
You can go to any site that compares markets or shows volume. China has by far the most, not including all the markets that have CNY in them. Logically, I would assume the country with the largest market and the most bitcoins would have the most control over the actual value. I could be wrong, but that's my opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:29:04
Yep, that's what market investors do. I have faith in blockchian technology, it has shown it's potential in the past. We love bitcoins, this is our passion.
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:59:09
Anything that has value in people's opinion can be used as a currency. BTC is also decentralized and not controlled by governments or regulated.

It's just a guess. If i'm wrong, then please tell us why it's dropping in value.
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:02:23
Well i don't know if you're wanting him to spend it or invest it, but you might want to tell him about site's like BTCe where you can trade it into different fiat or cryptocoins. I thought that was the coolest thing ever when i first got into bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:30:27
I saw that to. I thought i sorted the posts wrong or something. must be a bug.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:35:02
Well I need to know exactly what data you are looking for before I can help. Transaction data could mean a lot of different things. Are you looking for the amount of orders placed? The about of BTC purchased? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:05:27
Money is in the market, not mining. It's just not worth it anymore. Unless you have high end mining equipment or you want to mine smaller cryptos
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:15:13
Well I read an article, I think it was on coin desk, saying that you can predict the future of BTC by looking at the stock market. It showed a chart, over-lapping both of them. They were quite identical, both hit highs and lows at the same time. But when I tried to compare charts of my own, I found the opposite like you said. So I wasn't sure if I was missing something here
@_date: 2015-03-16 05:19:50
It will take time. The more times it goes over 300, the better the chance of maintaining a stable value over 300. It's happened in the past, and will happen again. Although I think the biggest wall will be BTC hitting 2000 CNY. People forget CNY is 80% of the market.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:29:40
Has anyone really figured out the connection on how the stock market affects bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:10:00
Seems like a neat concept. I might give it a try someday, I'm just extremely picky about where i send my BTC

@_date: 2015-03-13 21:43:06
You do understand when you invest in BTC, you're not investing "in a currency", but the success of revolutionary technology known as blockchain. Also, I'm sure IBM people are smart enough to realize that they could make a crypto already. Regardless of how many shit coins there are or the market cap for them.

Why does he only accept bitcoin? I mean, it is possible an all, but if I was selling something, I would accept USD as well. Sounds kinda scammy
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:03:04
Why not just use a normal market like OKCoin, sell everything and buy it right back. Less fees, and it does the same thing you're trying to do. That's what I would do anyways.
@_date: 2015-03-07 10:16:58
If you look at charts, anyone can see that the value has slowly been dropping. But with mining fees, investors, and more merchants accepting bitcoin,  I don't see the value going below 250 USD anytime soon. As for the future, I do see it increasing in value, but only up to around $500. But that's just my personal analysis/opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:17:45

@_date: 2015-03-09 02:09:02
Na, not a glitch. Just some kid thinking he can manipulate the market. Anyone could sell an amount of bitcoin super low, but it's not going to affect the actual value. Even if it did, it would only effect that exchange on that market. It's all the markets combined that makes the price value (somewhat) stable.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:39:28
It really depends on the value on other markets, especially larger ones like BTCChina. So before you can assume that there's actually is a wall, you need to check the other markets and compare the data.
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:05:12
Well that's understandable. It really comes down to how much time do you have to be watching the market (which probably isn't much if you're a parent and work a full time job for example). But either way, you will still need the basics. After buying BTC from circle (or coinbase), find a market you like depending on how you want to trade. Transfer the funds into that market. If you are doing short term investments, look at charts in 1-5 minute intervals. For long-term, look at charts in day/week intervals and decide what a good price is to buy in at, and place a buy order for that price. One really good tip I'll give you, never go "all in", especially if you're new to the market or are investing a lot of money. If you need any help about when or how much you should be buying and selling for, just PM me and i'll help you out.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:24:15
Well, it's like in a market where you are trading for the current sale price. You are paying them for their services (transferring fiat to BTC, then sending it to your wallet)and their fees they have to pay. And I'm sure setting up a network of ATMs that use the new crypto technology doesn't come cheap. I'd imagine they have a lot of debt to pay off before they can even make a profit. Another reason for the price is because the instability in BTC value. If they sold you a bunch of BTC for 300USD and the market suddenly shoots up to 400, that's a lot of money they are going to be loosing.  TL;DR: If i went to a bitcoin atm, I'd expect to be paying a lot more.

@_date: 2015-03-11 17:00:51
The problem is a lot of this information really isn't tracked because bitcoin markets are international. But, the Philippines use PHP for their fiat, and that's what would be converted into BTC. All i was able to find is the price value (PHP) compared to BTC. I know that doesn't help you much, but it's a good start. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:46:36
"value" is determined by what people understand as it's importance, worth, or usefulness, therefor will constantly be changing. It's Impossible for anything in this world to have static value. Example: Euro to USD dropped from 1.6 to almost 1:1.

Fuck that, my mom can buy her own bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-08 23:45:54
Start off with a smaller crypto like LTC Lite coin. They are a little under 2 bucks each right now. Play with that until you learn more about the markets and work your way up. Other coins you could consider (but may be more risky) are ripple, PPC, DOGE, Nova, and FTC feathercoin. I started out with a few bucks in FTC, then switched to LTC.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:04:57
For 160,000 people to invest in bitcoins is still a a little much IMO at the time being, may change in the future. But getting anyone to invest half a million in something is no simple task, still a very risky situation. Now I could be wrong wrong, but bitcoin is *about* a 4-5 billion dollar market. To raise it up to that number (from 300 usd) would be a %381 increase. That's an unimaginable amount to have to be dumped into the system. edit: Last part of the post was for OP, not a reply to your post, sorry, got confused XD
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:51:58
LTC fluctuation will normally go up and down with bitcoin, but it is its own market and will stray off a bit sometimes. First, look at markets. Do you want a safe &amp; stable market like BTCe, or a slightly more risky market with little/no fees like OkCoin. (I'm using Okcoin right now, haven't had any issues. I only have 80$ in BTC, so it's not a major risk). Another thing you want to look at besides fees is the layout. BTCe has one basic layout, OKcoin has different graphs and charts, as well as analysis tools you can use on them. Okcoin only supports BTC to USD and LTC to USD (not including the CNY market side). BTCe however, you can do the same, but trade BTC for LTC directly, or other cryptos including PPC, Nova, etc.
