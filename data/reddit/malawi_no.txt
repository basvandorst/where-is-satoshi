Don't put all your funds in an exchange, read about MtGox.

Hmm, BTC were cheap on the goxx just before it closed down.

Euro have existed for 15 years, would that be long enough time?

Check if you can increase the fees.  
You should be golden in the 500+ range.  
Backlogs seems to be clearing up and fees coming down again.  
I did a swift transaction at 512 sat a few hours ago. It was locked at block 500601 and got included in 500602.

Yes, hodling is free and fees will come down.  
As an added bonus, fees will go down and prices will go up when lightning arrives.

This is a travesty!  
Trying to lure innocent people to that site that will not be named.

Thanks.:-)  
Turned out I did not have any.  
I was a bit to late to bitcointalk for the giveaway you linked to, so guess I made the wallet to be ready for another giveaway.  
  
Might have gotten some sign-up bonus though and transferred to another wallet (don't generally trust the cloud for safekeeping). I know I lost my mostly empty litecoin wallet in a HD-crash, together with some other altcoins.  
I had only done a proper backup of my bitcoin wallet, so I guess any ripples I had are lost. :-/  
  
BTW: Make sure to claim your Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin Gold if you have not done so already.

Argh.  
  
Lost a few coins there and almost did a ragequit.  
Moved over to BTC-E, but the magic was gone.  
  
As BTC have been a lot in the news lately, I went back to BTC-E to find that it was seized, then found out that it was turned into WEX, and logged in over there to find a completely empty account...  
  
Finally got to restored my btc wallet with the little that was left there. Not sure if i had any Litecoins though, but then again, I cannot find it's wallet.dat

Apparently the lightning network might not be to far off.  
Then there will be an alternative option to send BTC where many transactions are collected to be done in one go without increasing the blockchain.  
  
If lightning network is implemented, throughput will increase massively, while fees gets slashed.

Transaction id?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:51
Did a transaction at the time of block 500287 at 200sat/byte.  
Bitcoinfees, estimates it to up to 24 hours, vs up to 21 hours when I placed the transfer order.

The exchange is the middle man.  
You give them USD or BTC to store in their "vault".  
  
Now you have a claim towards them of the amount of USD and/or BTC you have with them. When you trade you pay them a small fee to shift some numbers. As you buy BTC, USD is taken from your account and given to those you buy from.  
  
If you buy 1 BTC, it might be from one seller or 100 sellers selling 0.01 BTC each.  
Same with selling BTC, if you put 1 BTC on the market, parts of it might go to different buyers.  
Either way, it's just a number in the exchanges system that represent their customers actual holdings.

Yes. That's caller arbitraging. Different exchanges might have a different balance between buyers and sellers. 
  
The risk of arbitraging is that the prices might have shifted before the assets reach the other exchange, but it helps keeping the prices relatively equal over time.  
  
If there is an influx of BTC at bitso, prices will go down, and people might withdraw some and send to coin base. etc. etc. ad infinitum.

I am in the exact same position, pretty sure I had my ripples at ripple.com.  
  
I have a string though that I assume is a ripple private key, so now I'm trying to find a post with my wallet address or something to claim them.  
  
I assume you also was goxxed hard, I lost a few coins to that site and rage quitted BTC.  
  
Luckily I kept my BTC wallet, other wallets (unfortunately)not so much.  
  
A little blast from the past -
