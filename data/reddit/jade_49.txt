Men are inherently immoral? Sounds pretty feminist and manhating of him.
Men see makeup and just can't stop from sexually harassing women??
Or the fact that they're wearing make up justifies seuxal harassment? Somewhat?
Or women shouldn't wear make up because they will inevitably be sexually harassed? Because some men are monsters but they still need jobs?
And this is a man who's about personal responsibility?

Yes I know, I've typed it like 30 times and its a weird word.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:33:53
That's not how facts work. Facts are facts. You can confirm them. That's how science works. That's why he's a psuedo scientist...

The law he was arguing against already existed... The changes he was speaking against were just adding "gender identity" to an existant law at the end of a long list of other groups.
Basically it was a law that said "You cant fire people because of their race/sex/sexuality" and they added "or gender expression"
So, yes it did already exist.
Also it doesn't make you legally say anything. I suggest you read the bill, and the original law, it's like 2 pages double spaced. It protects them from discrimination. Basically trans people can transition without being fired/evicted.
That's it.

Glad you aren't tbh.
So fraud should be legal because it's free speech? That's the logical extension of your "total free speech" argument.

Heres a basic video on one of the many many crazy things that JP lieks to just say. As to bill c16 you can google the changes it made. Or you can watch the JP contrapoints video, or her video on pronouns which addresses the pronouncs controversy. You can also look up the very mysognystic things hes said (enforced monogomy is needed to stop incel violence, women are sexually assaulted because they wear makeup and some men cant help themselves)
He's a religious psuedo intellectual moron.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:28:47
Another video showing just how stupid he can be.
He regurgitates basic self help tropes. They help people. If Hitler gave a speech that included the thesis of "Seven habits of highly effective people" that wouldn't make the rest of his views logical or palitable.
Just because he borderline plagarized some self help stuff your parents should've taught you when you were 10 doesn't mean his other ideas aren't stupid or dangerous.

I've read the bill (which is an alteration to another law, it adds maybe 20 words to an already existant law).
The law he was arguing against already existed... The changes he was speaking against were just adding "gender identity" to an existant law at the end of a long list of other groups.
Basically it was a law that said "You cant fire people because of their race/sex/sexuality" and they added "or gender expression"

He has a legal right to call a transwoman a man to her face. But no one has the legal right to call him a cook in a private setting.
Cut and dry free speech.

Bill C16, I suggest you read it and the text it ammended, they're not long and you'll see why Peterson is an idiot.
@_date: 2018-12-31 00:07:11
**just read the bill**
It's 2 pages double spaced.
His arguments dont hold water, it's been a bill for over a year, you can read it and clearly see he's wrong (which you clearly haven't because you keep saying things that clearly show you havent read it) and top legal scholars say he's wrong.
You're wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:57:53
BRB, asking my doctor friend.
He says you're wrong.
It protects people with a mental condition? Wowza.
You know there are laws that allow you to take service dogs into places that wouldn't otherwise let you for if you have autism disorder and might have a freak out.
You don't know what you are talking about.
Okay. Simple as that.


This line proves it. You haven't read bill c16.
You can't have and also say this sentence.
You have no expertise. You are not a doctor, you are not a lawyer, you haven't even read the bill in question.
You are simply wrong.
If the bill compels speech could you show an example of it being abused?
You know you also are compelled not to call your employees the n word, or a faggot.
And you could probably make a pretty shitty argument about how "it's true" and so you're having your free speech taken away.
Fortunately people who own businesses have the maturity to not use slurs against their employees. And in Canada you can't fire someone for being gay. Sorry to any biggots who are inconvenienced.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:48:06
Fortunately that's not what the law said at all. Phew.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:50:50
He is totally far off, ask any legal scholar.
As are you. Bill C-16 was an addendum to an already existent law that added **Literally one group of individuals** to a list of **other groups of individuals**
It added trans people to a list of other groups (races, sex, sexuality) on an already existant law.
You literally have it 100% backwards. Probably because you're listening to JP and not actually looking into it yourself.
Read bill c16 and the changes it makes to the already existent law. It's like 2 pages double spaced, it's not long.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:47:22
No its not. The bill altered a different already in existant law. It added "gender identity" like 4 times onto the end of a few lists "race, sex, sexuality..." that you can't fire/evict because you don't like them.
The bill is over a year old, has anyone been fined or charged over pronoun misuse?
Peterson basically read a law that said "You can't murder people" and said "so now I can't even express abstractly how I wanted people to die? That's a violation of free speech"
The man has no legal expertise and it shows. Which is why a bunch of legal scholars were like "What are you talking about Peterson?"
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:19:28
Jordan Peterson is a nincompoop who should stick to self help and faith related topics but doesn't because he can trick rubes.
The entire thing is his fault, because he's rude and arrogant and kinda ignorant, and he is basically a con artist whos figured out how to get dumb people to give him money. He's basically the Canadian version of info wars, which is to say an incendiary person who creates controversies for profit.
All this trouble over this man, bleh what a waste. He's a 60 year old with no accountability and money up to his ear making a fuss over what is basically nonsense. What does he produce, truly. Noise.
As to the legal case, JP's is frivolous which is why they threw it at someone else, the frivolousness of their case, I think it being thrown out will lead to his being thrown out, and I think his Patreon clone will likely fail. He either is trying to get a bigger % because he looked at Patreons cut (of which I have no idea what it is, it could be extortionary) , or Patreon was gonna cut him off because of whatever and he got in front of it.
Eiiiither way I think he'll fall out of revelance soonish. He's said plenty of generally off putting things (in a moral and scientific sense) and is increasingly shady, dealing with distasteful people and being greedy. 
I think trans people just uh, win?
I don't wanna declare it early, but I'm calling it now. We win? Which is great for you guys because I bake. We're just around now, like Koreans, or old people.
OOOOOoooooOOOooOOooooOO Old people.
You just have to deal with it, sorry for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:37:57
It's not. The law JP fought against didn't say what he said it did and the response to his senate testimony was "wtf are you talking about?".
The law was "You can't fire someone if you find out they're gay"
And they added "If they're trans"
Basically a trans person can transition without being evicted or fired.
JP is a moron who fancies himself an expert on everything but is incredibly out of his element when talking about basically anything that's not psychology and he's not even a particularly respected psychologist.
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:37:43


I do not really know much about that case. University politics is frankly childish and unimportant.
If you'd like my opinion as a visibly trans person:
* Everyone should get a life
* Just call people by the gender they dress as. It's literally always obvious. Or just avoid using them if you're not sure. There are not that many trans people, this should come up less than literally hundreds of issues that directly effect you
* Trans people, come out, correct someone if you want, you will get misgendered, just be calm and move on.
Trans pronouns are basically just politeness. We are an overly polite country, this isn't hard.
You say sorry if someone else bumps into you. You say thank you for everything, you don't say like, 90 words, in public.
That's Canadian.
Cis people try your best. Trans people be polite.
**YOU TIP BAD WAITERS**
You do. Just use the persons fucking pronouns. Be nice! I'm nice to religious people, I don't mention their beliefs are nonsense. I don't casually bring up how good pork is to jewish people, I don't argue with vegans, I avoid talking about politics with Conservative Americans.
And as for me, I've literally not had a person be a dick to me in over a year.
Not one impolite person. People make mistakes. Every day. Hundreds of times even. I don't caaaare. I'm me, leave me alone.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:30:11
Um, actually the self help advice he gives to young males is the thing he is universally given credit for.
People hate him because he's a religious whackjob who lies constantly, makes things up constantly, denies climate change and dances with alt right types.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:26:52
[Here's a video]( highlighting one of many instances of JP making up nonsense.
I've listened to a fair number of his debates, and he consistantly makes up things about stuff he has no understanding of as premises for larger points.
He's not trustworthy because he has shown himself to be willing to totally fabricate statements in order to barrel towards his world view, and suggests you read entire books for every couple sentences of his statements in hour long word salads.
The man is a smart person's Trump, he's a bit of a con artist tbh.
