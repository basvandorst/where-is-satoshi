1. It's very, very, very hard to time the market (especially with the bitcoin wild ride)
2. If you want to invest long term and are already sold on bitcoin then the best bet would be [Dollar Cost Averaging](
3. Bitcoin by design is deflatory currency and over long term (few years) it seems to be holding up. So my best guess would be to always invest ASAP, provided we're not at a rally.
4. You should take any advice from strangers over the internet with extreme caution and only do what sounds reasonable to you.
5. Also I wouldn't invest more then you feel comfortable losing since currently it's a bit of a wild west here and chances that you'll lose your bitcoin one way or the other are pretty big.

The point is the more value something has the harder it is to move it by 20%. So if market cap will be 100x what it is today, the swings should be much smaller since you need much more money to influence the market. If bitcoin is to succeed, we're still in the penny stock phase right now so violent swings are to be expected.

How many companies do you know, that backed a failed technology, switched to something else, recovered and managed to be a good investment? To each their own though. I've done a ton of reasearch (I'm constantly doing more), and it led me to believe that bitcoin is a good bet. If you think betting on companies is better then go bet on companies. I personally see them as bigger risk. I'm not trying to convince you to change your mind, just sharing my perspective, answering your original question.


Yes, and the miners are doing it currently. I don't see where you'd insert a publicly traded company into the picture though?

You're really investing in the tech/protocol that the currency is based on. And the answer to "why should I invest in bitcoin tech" is that if it will gain mainstream adoption, the currency is bound to be worth much more than currently.

.com bubble happened because people threw lots of money on shitty companies. Just like right now people are throwing lots of money on shippy cryptocurrencies. That doesn't mean that e.g. Amazon was a bubble, just like it doesn't mean that bitcoin is a bubble. And bitcoin is has really competent people behind it, with a really reasonable approach, unlike many alts.
A lot of crypto will pop since there's a shitload of them and realistically only a few can gain mainstream adoption. The fun thing is that the easiest way to liquidate altcoins is to sell them for bitcoin so it's possible that death of altcoins will actually give more value to bitcoin. 
It's also possible that many people will lose faith in crypto in general though, so who knows.

Bitcoin is very much taxed in form of capital gains in most countries I've heard of (including USA). Now there's a lot of problems with this interpretation, nevertheless if you e.g. sell bitcoin on an exchange and make a profit and don't include this in your tax form then you've basically commited tax fraud.
And as far as the volatility goes it's still very early in the adoption phase. The more people are using it, the bigger the market cap and the bigger the swings. We're still not there yet, but that doesn't mean we can't get there at all. I mean, you could easily say the same to Wright brothers when they made their first flight. "LOL, how is this going to be useful transport device, it barely lifted one person for a few seconds". If bitcoin is to achieve all that it's supposed to be, then we have a long way to go and we're still very early in the process.

I mean, I've already written why I consider it safer. And as far as answering this in general then the 3000% gains holders made over the last few years seem like a pretty good reason to me. What companies could you've invested in that got that kind of gains? I'm not saying this certainly won't change in the future, but for now, nothing comes close.

There are people who actually trade. Most likely there will be investment funds that will actively trade.

The problem with fees now is directly tied to the fact that bitcoin has risen in value like crazy over the last few months and this isn't anything you can realistically predict or plan for. And there is a solution that not only helps to decrease the fees, it's actually a valid improvement in the protocol - SegWit. It it allows for bigger amount of transactions while still technically holding the 1MB limit (go read up on details if you're interested). Adoption rollout was slow and the adoption is still low but the whole point with it was so it was "opt in". Basically the core devs are in agreement that with the scale of Bitcoin now, it's much better to make small, careful changes instead of "let's just do a quick fix while we work on the real solution" since "quick fixes" are the things that usually lead to bugs and/or crashes.
There are many reasons why one might want things like Segwit and LN instead of "let's just increase the blocksize for a while". The main one is that it has permanent effect to achieve temporary fix. Not only don't we know if it will actually help (see  to read up on how bigger blocks may actually make things worse), it make the whole blockchain bigger to store - so even if you revert it at some point, your blockchain will be permanently bloated with 2MB blocks, requiring more storage. Now in this case it might not be a big issue but it's a terrible precedent. Imagine how the blockchain/bitcoin would look in 10-20 years if you coded it in a way that has permanent stigma for each "quick temporary fix" you applied.
If you're interested in more info then here's a talk that touches on the same subject (i.e. why don't we just increase the blocksize):

A few things on twitter happened.  
First he simply stated, when asked that the isn't a "bitcoin millionaire" because he isn't a long time holder. Then the community favorite, Roger Ver, made fun of him for that. Andreas responded that he isn't a "bitcoin millionaire" despite believing in bitcoin and preaching for it for a very long time, because he didn't have any spare funds to invest at the time and sold all of his early BTC very early to afford rent and support his family.  
So you've got a community favorite that was publicly shamed for not being rich by a community least favorite, followed by a class response + sob story form the favorite. At this point I think it's half just wanting to support him, half wanting to stick it to Ver.

The commonly accepted idea is that limited inflation (currently the aim in the US is 2% I think) stimulates the economy, because it promotes spending and/or investing. Whether that is true or not is a different question, that I don't feel educated enough to try to answer, but people just pointing out inflation as it's some kind of "gotcha!" argument come off as just plain ignorant. If you simply hold your money, it's considered bad for economy (by most economists, which presumably know what they're talking about), therefore inflation is specifically implemented into the currency so you don't do that.
So TL;DR it's designed that way so you don't hold your money in a mattress but spend or invest instead, which is considered more beneficial for economy/society.

You can't *at the moment* since we're in the middle of the biggest bull run to happen to bitcoin. You could a few weeks ago, you could a few months ago, you could a few years ago and when segwit and LN will get common adoption you will be able to do it again. It's like saying "how can spaceX get us to mars when they've never even sent anyone to space yet". It's a process, and we're slowly getting closer and closer. The wild speculative bubbles on the way are just a side effect.

Do you mean in effectiveness or likelihood of passing? Because it's definitely way more likely to pass than an internet ban (especially with current administration). All you need is a good spin on it ("drug money", "fighting crime", "fighting hackers", "safety of citizens", "ponzi" etc.) and the public will eat it up.
And when it comes to severity then both internet ban and bitcoin ban would be extremely effective since no company will want to get in legal trouble. Sure, it will still work as peer to peer currency, but you won't be able to buy anything with it from a legally operating business and if they ban exchanges running in the US, then selling it and getting your funds will be a pain in the ass as well.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:17:23

You seem to imply that bitcoin now is what bitcoin strives to be. Right now bitcoin is still in it's infancy. It's still pretty dangerous and unstable. Right now it's not better than using cash. Btw. I think it will never be better than using cash, but it doesn't strive to be. The goal is to be better than paying via Debit/Credit Card or making a bank transfer. But as of *right now* it's still not really "better". Bitcoin is still growing and new solutions are regularly introduced (e.g. we're still waiting for reliable hardware wallets that are soon to come).  
He didn't pay the premium because bitcoin is better. He payed premium because curretly bitcoin is way more confusing, dangerous and hard to grasp. This will change with time, but today's usability is nowhere near the end-line usability.  
So he basically paid a premium because the payment was more covinient for HIM and less convinient for the guy he paid. This is expected to change in time as more and more people are knowlegable about bitcoin and the whole process is simplified.  
Also he didn't NEED to pay the premium. Many online shops charge LESS for BTC payments because they avoid the Debit/Credit Card fee. This is an isolated scenario where someone decided to basically tip someone else. You can't really conclude that "this is the future of bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:34:37

The problem is, for bitcoin to really function properly as a currency or even a payment system, it needs to be officially supported or at least ignored by goverments. As a buyer, you're in the clear. But if the state doesn't want vendors to accept bitcoin it can very simply forbid that or hit them with ridiculous taxes, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  
Torrents are a missed example since it's either used for freeware (so cannot be really hit with taxes or any income related stuff) or for stuff that's illegal to upload/download either way.  
So while bitcoin technology/network cannot be realistically killed, it's widespread acceptance by businesses can be successfully and very easily bombarded by tax/currency laws.

The service went down pretty fast (5 minutes or so). If the attacker wasn't quick enough with withdraws then the money is safe. And even if he did manage to withdraw all of his BTC (unlikely), "only" 18K BTC was stolen. This is no MTGOX, but this was the most popular polish exchange. If anything is lost, most likely only the coin that were bought. So if you stored fiat and BTC on bitcurex and didn't do any trades while the attack took place, you should be fine. Any other scenario - I guess it's 50/50. But this is all jjust guessing. Props to bitcurex staff for reacting so quickly. Let's see what come out of this.

No matter when you bought in, simply holding to S&amp;P shares would give you profit as of today. Even if you bought in right before the 2008 crash, never bought after and never sold you'd be profitable today.  
Of course buying at the dip, right after the crash would get you better results but trying to time the market isn't going to be profitable to you long term, especially if you're a novice.

Create a paper wallet:   
Read this and follow instructions://  
After you've done all that you should have 1BTC siiting in your bitstamp.net wallet. Go to their "withdrawl" section and withdraw your 1BTC to your paper wallet. Btw. if you want it to be exactly 1BTC check what fees you have to pay on bitstamp for BTC withdrawl and buy 1BTC + fee and withdraw that. I can't find any info about their fees, maybe someone here will know.

If so, this means that it's easily traceable to a single person, which is good. It also means that this person is probably shitting him/herself right now. It also means that they might have not cashed out, since it was dumb luck, not a coordinated strike. But if this was a known issue someone has to get fired at Bitcurex, no doubt.

You have no idea how exchanges works. You just state your price for selling. It's displayed anonymously. If anyone states a price for buying that correlates with yours, the transaction is done automatically and anonymously. Your BTC will be up for sale until they all get sold that way. Noone knows who buys BTC from who. Noone cares. The exchange is the middle man and it's the exchange that needs any kind of reputation.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:53:33
Don't get me wrong. I use lastpass on all sites that don't really matter to me. But I have exclusive passwords for accounts related with BTC and my bank account. They are strong and I just remember them. I have a copy on an encrypted USB stick stored at my parent's place, so I'm covered even if I ever forger them. No matter how "safe" it may be I will never trust and online service to store a password that gives access to all of my money.

Nobody knows. You can't predict any of this. You never know if you're in a bubble and if you are you never know what phase you're in (well, maybe in the mania phase when you suddenly hear about bitcoin rising in news, but you never know where the top will be). You can scale the graphs up and down and make every scenario fit the pattern. You can just look back and say "yeah, that was a bulltrap". Whichever it becomes will be decided by future price swing that nobody knows jack shit about, but people at try their best to analyze throwing fancy names and graphs. Also not all bubbles end up with a return to the mean, sometimes it just stays low.

I was going to ask why would gender be relevant but there are many services and products that are gender related, so I guess this answers it.

I think it's 1BTC vs 1 ounce which are the standard measures used to determine the price of both (at least in US, since rest of te world uses metric and grams).
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:24:03
To start with, just stop putting words in my mouth (hands?), please.  
To follow: I agree that bitcoin's usability right now is terrible. It's way less *convinient* than using cash, card or a bank transfer. It's security is sub-par. It needs a lot of money, investments and support to be better or as good as other forms of payments **in terms of usability and security**.  
That's not what bitcoin's core idea is about. It's mostly about decentralization. It's about the fact that it's value is not correlated with any goverment, noone can seize your funds, noone can impose fees on you, noone can hold your transactions. It's mostly totally *different* than other forms of payments. For people that value those principles it's better. For people that don't care about them, it's just different.  
So yes, there are aspects of bitcoin (mostly usability, convinience and security) that now are worse than the alternatives and they require a lot of work and investments. But once that is sorted out, it's goal is to provide a similar or better service, while **also** introducing it's actual core principle, that is decentralization and eliminating the need for a middleman.

@_date: 2014-03-06 09:14:45
There are workaround for that. If it's a big transaction, they can take your name and address from your ID and sign something, so they know who you are, if you double spent. They get that info if you pay with credit/debit card anyway. Or maybe something else, I just made this up in 10s. If people will want to pay and accept payments in bitcoin, I'm sure someone will eventually figure something out.

I think the core idea is that you don't have to convert to fiat eventually. Sure NOW it's safer to do so but I doubt the end game for bitcoin is 1) convert to bitcoin 2) pay 3) convert to fiat. You achieve almost nothing on such a transaction.
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:10:36
I'll just copy and paste my reply to a different comment:
The problem is, for bitcoin to really function properly as a currency or even a payment system, it needs to be officially supported or at least ignored by goverments. As a buyer, you're in the clear. But if the state doesn't want vendors to accept bitcoin it can very simply forbid that or hit them with ridiculous taxes, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.  
Torrents/p2p are a missed example since it's either used for freeware (so cannot be really hit with taxes or any income related stuff) or for stuff that's illegal to upload/download either way, so it's not done by any businesses.  
So while bitcoin technology/network cannot be realistically killed, it's widespread acceptance by businesses can be successfully and very easily bombarded by tax/currency laws.
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:37:47
While true, you only need it suppressed in USA and China for it to significantly diminish it's potential. That's just two players. Also since EU rules are above local goverment laws, it can be killed in almost all of Europe by a single ruling. That's just three rulings and most of global market is essentially gone for bitcoin.  
I'm not saying it's likely, but it definitely can be done and isn't that hard as people portray it to be.

This is bizarre. I may be getting the VAT stuff wrong but I always imagined that the seller pays the tax. I mean, yes in practice they forward the payment to buyer by adjusting the price for the VAT they have to pay. But all things considered, the person who is legally responsible for paying is the seller. It either works like that in Poland or I don't know what the fuck is happening anymore.  
edit: wikipadia tells me that I'm right and (at least in Poland) VAT is the tax that you have to pay if you provide services or sell goods. Are you sure it's not the same way in Norway?

Opposed to noone. Anyone who claims to know what will happen with price is full of shit.

If you hang around you'll notice that it's basically flooded with all kind of random predictions and almost all go to hell. Some are occasionally correct due to statistics - there are so many of them that some are bound to hit by pure luck.

The best and simplest way is the same now as it has been years ago. Buy what you can and hold. It's the strategy that has proven to be most effective, both with bitcoin and with stocks (S&amp;P 500). Everything else is definitely not simple and will most likely give you worse results.  
*Just make sure you don't buy during or just after a big rally (like right now)*.  
edit: oh, and also, for the time being the simplest and safest way to store your bitoins is (in my opinion) blockchain.info with two passwords and 2 Factor Authentication (meaning you get additional code via sms everytime you log in). Don't store your money on exchanges. When you're done you can read about cold storage and decide if that's for you. You can also try coinbase but I never used it so I can't say anything about it.

I'm not sure if this works everywhere, but in Poland you can use PayPass cards for up to ~16$ per transaction and it's processed offline and then later confirmed at your bank.

All eggs in one basket + it's not even your basket. While I agree noone should or deserve to have their money stolen from them, this only happened to people who didn't follow any security logic.

That's still just an underground market, no legitimate businesses. If bitcoin is pushed to that niche than it will be successfully "shut-down" and will lose in value significantly. Right now most of the price consists of speculation about future growth and is driven by people wanting to make a profit on mass adoption. If it will be clear that never happens and bitcoin will have to stick to illegal lowrises, most of these people will pull out.

Bitcurex is also "no questions asked". They only require verification when you lock your data for editing. If you do so, but then want to change your banking details, email, BTC address then they need a copy of your ID and a signed statement. Also they recently handled a hacker attack very profesionally - the service has been cut off 5mins after the attack, first statement has been made about 1h after that, and next day morning a statement "your balances will not be affected" has appeared. Service was up and running in ~5 days, and everybody got their funds from before the attack restored. Only downside is they do PLN and EUR only, no USD yet (they're based in europe). PLUS, they sign their statements with full address.

Currently it might need a lot of things that it won't in the future. What you're seeing is the technology acquiring it's form through hoops and struggles.

You may be thinking "it shouldn't have to" but it's exactly the opposite. It definitely has to. It has to get all of the bullshit shaken off while it's still relatively small (in regard of what it strives to be) so it can be reliable when it's past that. We've seen mtgox fail but thanks to that other exchanges invested in more security and people started demanding more evidence of that. We'll probably get through this 51% bullshit once for all sooner or later and we'll have that put of the way. And yes, people may lose money. Only after we've dealt with this kind of bullshit you'll be able to say it's safe. Right now it's noy, nobody claims it is. It's an experiment that hopefully will pay off. If you're not interested it's fine, but don't go around bashing it for not being something that it can only become through dealing with it's problems.

The biggest polish exchange, bitcurex.com just started operating after blocking a hacker attack. It was down for couple of days. The price went down since people that got scared started selling out. The other exchanges followed I suppose. Add this to the blockchain.info news and you've got yourself a panic situation I suppose.

I don't think the issue here is about the semantics of the 'fanatic' word. My idea is, if you're 100% sure that something happens and it does, it still doesn't justify your certainty. If you have 15k in savings and use it all to buy lottery tickets and then win you're still a dumbass for doing it.  
Btw. I'm not trying to compare probability of bitcoin success with winning a lottery but this just illustrates my point nicely.

@_date: 2014-05-27 09:36:01
It depends on how you define gambling. By the dictionary definition gambling means it's mostly luck. Poker isn't mostly luck as there are tournaments and recurrent winners. There are also people that live solely on poker winnings. This means that poker is more a game of skill not chance, thus doesn't fit the gambling definition. You're also not playing against the house but other players (unlike e.g. blackjack) so the game rules are not rigged against your. Poker is basically a sport, in the same way chess are. Just the fact that you can lose money on it (if you suck) doesn't mean it's gambling. Actually it's more of a statistics game than anything else.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:46:42
It's like you totally misunderstood the whole point. It's not "the future of bitcoin" it's just a way to encourage people to adapt **now**, while it's still in it's infancy.  
If you want to share your car with coworker while going to work (to split the bill expenses) you might say "come on, the first ride is free". This doesn't mean that now you have to drive around more, hauling your coworker's ass for free, it just means you took a loss to convince him to take a mutually beneficient deal.
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:35:00
Why's that? The definition of gambling is that pure chance has the majority influence in your winning. You can't get good at winning a coin toss (like you can't get good at playing the roulette etc.). Games that involve both luck and skill e.g. poker don't fit the definition of gambling, so you can actually get good at them.

For a visual representation, [here's a graph]( that shows bear and bull traps during a bubble. Bull is the opposite of bear and bull trap is the opposite of bear trap.  
"Bears" are the people who assume bearish position towards a certain commodity - meaning, they think it will go down in value. They can profit by borrowing it from someone for a certain fee, sell it immediately, wait for the price to go down, buy it back and return the original amount + fee to the lender. The difference in prices, minus fee is your profit. That kind of "play" is called "shorting", so some people may say they are "bearish on bitcoin" or "short/shorting on bitcoin".  
Bear trap is a certain kind swing in the price. If the value went up for some time and suddenly reversed, some people may decide to go short in order to profit. But after a while the price shoots back up and continues to grow. To "short" the bears already sold what they borrowed but now they have to rebuy it at higher price to return it, so they lose money on it. They thought they can profit by being bearish, but it was just a small swing, so they got caught in a "trap". Hence the "bear trap".  
It's more ELI15 though.

I hope it just needs a critical mass. Noone is interested since they only hear about it in the news, and the news only pick up juicy stories.

The problem is that people currently have very strong and very different opinions about the topic.
The things that almost all agree is:
- Bitcoin's goal is mass adoption and usage worldwide, with robust, decentralized infrastructure. 
"Mass adoption" is a pretty loose term but I think the general idea is that when you ask some random people on the street most of them will be able to tell you "yeah, I've used it at some point" and only a small minority will say stuff like "what's bitcoin?" or "I've heard bitcoin CEO was busted for selling drugs online with his fake internet money".
Then it gets more problematic. People generally believe that the end goal should be one, all, or mix or the following (the further down the list the bigger and harder/less realistic the goal):
- Store of value, basically online gold. You buy it to store a lot of money in an asset that's independent of your government.
- Online payment currency. Something kind of like PayPal but decentralized. So if you want to e.g. transfer money internationally, without any governments telling you what you can and cannot do, you buy bitcoin, transfer it, and sell it "on the other side". The buying/selling here would probably be hidden behind a UI/protocol that basically does it for you, so the user wouldn't have to login to exchanges etc. You can also use it like paypal
- Global currency, used and treated in the same way government issued money is. A reasonable alternative to e.g. USD if want it to be. This is kind of where the focus is now I think, but all of the problems with scaling you might be reading about (blocksize, fees, transactions per second etc.) are the bottleneck if we're to hit mass adoption. It's the most lucrative option to third world countries and the ones with terrible economy (think Greece) that's on the edge of hitting hyperinflation or the gov being a pain in the ass in regards to local currency (like the Indian gov did with the rupee recently).
- Global currency that completely replaces government issued money and is the only currency in the world (IMO this one is just plain naive but a small minority of hardcore libertarians still believe it and many of them are in this subreddit).

As far as I remember it was created during the initial scaling debate. Some people got fed up, saying mods here censor their opinions about a soft fork or sth. So they made their own "true" bitcoin sub. Then they kind of radicalized with every new drama, slowly becoming the new buttcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:52:36
Nobody gave you a good reason because you're not wrong. If government forbids bitcoin exchanges in US and forbids vendor from accepting it then people will lose interest veeeery quickly.

We're still at the point where bitcoin is a novelty and mostly store of value/speculation/investment. If it's banned then basically it's capabilities as a currency are gone. Sure it won't stop the speculation/investment crowd, but that's not the end goal for bitcoin, it's just a stepping stone.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:34:21
The point of having money is to serve as a cushion or as money for your retirement. E.g. you suddenly have to spare 5 grand for emergency? No biggie. Totaled your car? Just buy a new one with money saved up. Hate your job? Leave. Usually you can find another one in a month or two, but for those months live out of the money you saved up. It really saves you a lot of trouble to just have money.
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:29:49
So the price would skyrocket because bitcoin would lose utility?
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:29:11
The easiest way would be to create a law that forbids running a business that undermines the US currency. A seemingly reasonable law. Then you just need to throw bitcoin (and any other crypto that might pop up) into the "undermines US currency" basket and voila. You can even put a nice little spin for the public, boasting how you're protecting the US dollar, US economy and thus US citizens. I guess that would sit well with current worldview of a major portion of US electorate, looking at the current POTUS.

I blew my brother's mind when I told him you can save/invest money not to spend it but to just... have money. It really didn't occur to him that you can just HAVE money. He's 30.
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:45:47
Which it already has and the price hasn't really skyrocketed because of it. The only thing it offers that cash doesn't is online payments but this isn't really that big of a market because buying illegal things online is very risky in itself. Plus people are reluctant to buy illegal shit online because if the seller doesn't ship your drugs/guns what are you going to do? Report him to the police?
Most of "everyday" illegal buying is buying drugs with cash. Most of the big scale, drug lord level, illegal trading is doing fine with cash as well since you need to pickup the shit in person anyway.
Yes, I know *SOME* dudes buy weed online with bitcoin. It's still pretty small market, and you won't reach mass adoption when the only utility is "it makes illegal shit easier" since everyone possessing it will admit that they buy illegal shit.

If you have a big cash flow and spend a lot of money on luxuries each month, you're not really poor. If you don't have any liquid assets and live paycheck to paycheck, but your paycheck is big enough you're not really poor.
And I don't think it's "I will lose it so better spend it" mentality, at least from what I observed. It's that this inability to fathom any other scenario than spending it. "You use money to buy things, right? So I buy things. Why wouldn't I buy it if I have the money? If the only use case is buying then why make your money useless by not buying stuff?"

Well "they should've been responsible" is an obvious answer, but the problem is "what do you do once you (as a government) realise that a bank was not being responsible and now cannot pay out the life savings of millions of people". You can't solve that with "they should've been responsible".
@_date: 2016-11-01 12:06:59
No, nobody knows. That's why you'll read everywhere that trying to time the market and guess the top or bottom is a fools errand, or gambling at best.
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:40:13
a) Trying to time the market is the worst strategy possible. It seems easy ("I'll just buy when it's low and sell when profit comes") but almost everyone gets burned badly eventually.
b) You asked totally random strangers for investment advice. This also almost never ends well because the people replying to you may be experts in investing or may as well be 18-year olds who know nothing and work in starbucks. It also clearly indicates that you have no idea what you're doing.
c) I did it only because there was already a "Yes" reply to further illustrate my points. Everyone can write "yes" or "no" on an anonymous forum and you have no way of knowing which answer is actually valuable.
I can try to offer some advice if you really need something. Bear in mind that if you lose your life savings on this then I don't really care about that at all though - nobody really does, further illustrating why you shouldn't ask questions like that. Anyway, here's what I did so obviously if anyone asks, my advice is to do the same:
Educate yourself on what bitcoin is. Educate yourself on all it's pros and cons (that's a lot of reading, and from different sources too). Decide for yourself whether you think this is a tech/solution that will last and that will be widely adopted (what this means is a totally different problem so educate yourself on that too). If you think yes - it's bound to be worth much more than now. Buy and don't sell it until it's actually mainstream/widely adopted. If you think not - just stay away.
Unless you just want to trade and make like 100% profit in a month and be done with it (or trade even more, based purely on price swings). Theoretically it's doable. It's also a suckers game in my opinion. But as I already stated earlier - I don't really give a rat's ass, so go ahead and make it big or lose a fuckload of money and nerves. Bear in mind though, that nobody knows wtf is going on with the price and what will happen in the future, so you're just guessing and/or asking other people to guess for you.

You do realise that if there's a cash run and no bailout, then people will lose money too? If the bank doesn't have enough money to cash people out and it fail, the people who were late on the run just... lose their money. So if you print more money to bail the bank out or use taxes to do it, you're just redistributing the losses to the entire country instead of just the people that happened to not do the bank-run.

Nope. Steam accepts it, Microsoft accepts it, overstock accepts it, a lot od small, local stores around the world do. There are many sites aggregating vendors accepting bitcoin. We're been past the "drugs and guns only" phase for a few years now. And if you're willing to use a middle-man that converts it to e.g. USD for you during payment then you can use it basically everywhere, but those kind of services are just temporary solutions as adoption grows slowly but steadily.

While true it can give a lot of ammunition to anti-bitcoin preachers. Can you imagine how big of a hit for adoption it would be if newspapers started putting out headlines like "BITCOIN USED TO STORE CHILD PORN". And then in the article they could write "if you run a bitcoin node you're in posession of child porn". If they can write something like this and be technically right, the details probably won't matter as you'll see a lot of people distancing themselves just to avoid a PR hit.

Hacked to few years after, never recovered. So yeah I wouldn't treat this as any kind of solid proof of security.
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:32:57
Did you miss the "invest the money" part of that sentence? The whole point is that people who don't want to spend always had the possibility to convert their money to something that appreciates in value. But noone ever says "oh no, goverment bonds are terrible for the economy, why would anyone buy a house if they can invest in bonds and have a house that's not only fancier but also od better quality".
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:47:23
That's why I said "take it with a grain of salt" since I'm not really THAT much into who wants what (I read a lot about bitcoin and almost nothing about bitcoin "celebrities"). But from the pieces of information I've gathered he's at least by proxy responsible for BCH, as he was for previous attempts to create Bitcoin Unlimited. By "created" I didn't mean he's the developer that actually did the fork, just that he throws money and a lot of words for it to be supported.

@_date: 2017-09-01 14:17:27
An extremely simplified version (this is just my understanding so take it with a grain of salt): he created a hard fork and steered people off of segwit that's a significant improvement in protocol because it fixes an exploit that can be used when mining and that he patented. All of the BCH and anti-Segwit drama was basically created by a guy that doesn't want a bug fixed because he found a way to exploit it and make lots of money.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:51:42
I think the point is it will be forever embedded into blockchain, which can create a lot of legal fuckery. If this service exists I'd say it's a valid point to discuss before it actually happens.

@_date: 2017-09-02 09:30:12
Well, after a year or two is equally easy in bear market. Imagine if you bought at 250USD (this was only 2 years ago). What's the worst that can happen? Oh no, it's gonna crash all the way to 2000USD and your ROI will only be around 700%. Terrible, terrible news :P

I have it safely stored on a Trezor so I guess I'm pretty safe there. I'm just looking for an exchange name or something like that.

Shit, I read the original post wrong. I thought the idea was for Barclay's stock to move, not bitcoin price. My bad.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:08:51
I split my coins using Trezor wallet and then moved my BTC to a Segwit address. I guess this should be enough then? Why would I need to do anything more?
@_date: 2015-09-25 06:05:56
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:58:45
Yeah, but that's insider trading and it's definitely illegal.

Why can't you?

He already answered this in the sticky post:

I'm not sure if you were aware but statistics say that Blockstream is nowhere near being synonymous with core development though.

Lol, no. Theymos deliberately stated that if 90% of sub disagrees then he expects 90% of sub to leave :P

There will be maximum 21 million bitcoin. If they cost 300 USD each this is 6,3 billion USD market cap. If you believe that bitocin will be a popular currency used worldwide 6,3 billion USD is way too low. That's a big ***if*** of course, but I assume most people that say bitcoin is undervalued assume that in one for on another.

So how is this different from the current banking model?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:45:21
Would you mind sharing why it's growing?
@_date: 2016-05-11 10:14:16
So basically what they're saying is "we can make bank transfers faster and cheaper (for the banks)" which is not what the blockchain is at all.
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:33:32
I like how you pulled the numbers straight out of your ass.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:18:38
Nobody knows shit. If people give you a simple bullshit answer like "just look at the mean growth and multiply it by X" ask for their sources and you'll see that they're full of shit.
Nobody really knows. Why would they? It can be 100$ in the next 10 years. It can be 100K in the next 10 years. Who knows what will happen in the next 10 years? Fucking nobody, that's who.

There is a small bitcoin atm in one of Wrocław's malls so it's not that bad :P

Yeah no. Just make a clean install, have some some decent set of lightweight tools (I use Should You Remove It, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and MSE), do a scan from time to time and **actually take care of what you install and from where**, you should be all fine. I don't remember having any kind of unwanted software on my PC ever, except for some adware crap that got installed alongside WinZip. Took me about ~15 minutes to detect and remove it though.
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:37:58
Is it really? I mean it literally happend once. This seems like nothing more than pure speculation.
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:22:10
It is but he says it in the first episode and then throughout the whole show, everyone says "evil corp". It doesn't really make that much of a difference IMO. The show wanted to call the bad guys "evil corp" so they did, and found a loophole so it's not that abysmal. Still very a bit too cringeworthy for my liking. Also they outright stole the "E" from Dell logo :P

Also they might not. It's terrible advice that basically boils down to "gamble your whole portfolio on this major, unprecedented, unpredictable event".

Someone wrote "HODLOR! HODLOR!" in the original thread back in 2013.
@_date: 2016-07-07 11:14:22
Oh shit, someone actually wrote in this thread "HODLOR! HODLOR!" in 2013. That's an interesting find.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:03:58
That's not theft, that's just paying for a service. When money is printed to bailout banks that's not paying for anything, yet all your money is suddenly worth less. There's a clear distinction.

I'll go against the grain here and say I got really disappointed when I tried it. Its critique of society is very hamfisted and the main character is has so many social issues that I couldn't get myself to relate at all. There's one direction that the series take that people really like but it's nothing that hasn't been done before (I'm as vague as I can here because spoilers). Also the big, evil corporation is called Evil Corp. The whole show is one big in my eyes and it's getting it's kicks out of being "above the average sheeple".
TLDR: if you think this is a great scene then it's a show for you:
