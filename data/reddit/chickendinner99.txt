Your post seems genuine enough to me, and represents a common enough misconception, that I'll spend the time to respond.
A lot of people are correctly criticizing your investment plan, but not explicitly explaining why it won't work. So here's your basic answer.
Essentially what you are doing is making a $10000 bet that the price will rise from $500 to $510. You are correct in assuming that this is very likely to occur, and if it does you will receive a 1.02% return on your investment. However, whenever you make a bet, you have to consider the odds. If the price rises above $510, you gain 1.02%, but if the price never raises above $510, you lose 100%. Because of this huge risk/reward disparity, you need to be at least 99% sure that the price will rise above $510 in order to make this investment. Considering bitcoin's history, the vast majority of traders do not believe with 99% certainty that the price of bitcoin will rise 1.02%. This same idea of betting a large sum of money with a great likelihood of winning a small reward, and a small chance of losing it all, can be seen here if you are interested: 
You may look at those odds (1.02% increase and 100% decrease) and think that a 100% decrease is unreasonable, which any trader would. So what do you do? You set a point at which you will sell your trade. A point where you realize that the likelihood of bitcoin ever reaching the initial goal is far away from 99%. For example, if bitcoin hits $100, you would need to reevaluate your trading plan, and form a new probability that bitcoin will ever reach your point of $510. 
Keep in mind that in the market traders are constantly competing against each other to be the ones who sell high and buy low. If you are not in the very top end of professional traders who do this for a living, there is almost no chance that you will make a significant amount of money in the long term day trading.
edit: I would like to clarify that many people fall for this same misconception in the Martingale betting system the first time they see it, so don't feel bad for not understanding it at first glance. While the failed results of using the betting system are more apparent here, understanding why isn't always intuitive.
