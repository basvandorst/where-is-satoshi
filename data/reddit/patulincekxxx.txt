I sold them all. I couldn’t watch how they decrease against BTC.

“Also that blockchain has value, but bitcoin doesn’t.”
It’s like to say:
“TCP/IP has value, but internet doesn’t.”

I had a few errors while following strictly one guide, so I had to improvise. But this site has a lot of great resources, maybe can help - [lnroute.com](

No you don’t need any high specs to run a node. Just a enough space (~200Gb) for Bitcoin Core.

Where can I get one?
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:33:40
Already listed.

Search in %appdata%, exact folder name depends on wallet you had been using. And the wallet file usually looks same or similar to “wallet.dat”.

Until 2140 we got plenty of time lol. You still pay for opening channels though and you can send a normal transaction with normal fee as well. And if Bitcoin adoption &amp; price will increase over time there’ll be a enough fees to cover mining costs.

In LN are fees 0 sats. You pay only once for opening channel, if I get it correct.
