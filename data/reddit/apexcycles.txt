late to the party I'm afraid

Ummm... I have 3 jobs.  But asking me how do I get dollars doesn't really explain anything to me.
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:07:14
That was very helpful... only took You 3 posts.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:17:18
nice... look forward to it.  Hope your server issues work themselves out so you don't have to go through this again... unless you like giving away money, feel free to send some my way anytime.

I'd give you a pretty decent discount if you paid with BTC, even make arrangements for a local shop to put it together for you.

Yes I sell kids bikes.  Mostly road racing and track bikes though.  But a couple of the lines I carry have kids bikes.    How old is the child?
I'll look into simple.com for an account.  Good idea to protect myself.

I can appreciate a smart ass... I'm usually one myself.  Going to try coinbase and just buy small amounts regularly.  I might offer to take BTC in my shop as well.  So if you ever need any bicycle related stuff, hit me up and pay via BTC.

can't connect :(  Really wanted the free $5 in BTC
@_date: 2015-03-06 07:01:44
like I said, I'll work up a deal.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:46:35
Lame, I couldn't even register, let alone redeem anything.
@_date: 2015-03-05 06:03:31
I can't afford 1 BTC... no way I could afford 50k of them :(
@_date: 2015-03-06 05:46:07
If you could be anymore vague...
Yes, I provide a service and get compensated accordingly.  So I should start asking for BTC compensation using a QR code?
Thats essentially taking BTC from other people.  My point is there had to be a beginning, where did those people get BTC from?
@_date: 2015-02-27 01:38:59
Wha?!.... Thank you!

Man. I would love $5 in bitcoin... lucky bastard.  I must be attending the wrong meetings.
