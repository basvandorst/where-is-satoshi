Have you not heard of OTC?
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:18:13
Right, and honestly, if bitcoin continues to be manipulated guess which way they want to manipulate it to go... Up
Bitcoin always rallies during and post consensus. This was a way to crash btc to buy in cheap before the rally
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:35:14
Finally, the truth comes out.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:14:22
Yes, bitcoin is being manipulated. Is it enough to deter a rally? No. A lot of very large sell orders yesterday. When large players unload a lot of bitcoin at market btc crashes a bit. Its clearly market manipulation but their orders have been filled. Now the market owns the bitcoin. And now we rally.
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:22:05
Youre taking the phrase hard bottom too literally. Yes its possible, but is it likely to happen? no.
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:16:09
Thats not true because miners would have to be consistently shutting off their rigs while other miners continue to mine. And if it become profitable again those miners would turn their rigs back on so its not that simple... at all
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:33:00
You would be surprised at the rate large investors are buying up btc
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:00:32
Thats the problem with a profit driven society. The 1% will stay the 1% forever because they have no inventive to share their wealth. Keep the profits at the top and youll keep getting richer and richer.
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:08:39

There is only one way to find out!
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:42:42
Except that bitcoin is usually being bought up pretty quickly. The problem is that the buy side can’t support miners selling as well as weak hands. Thats why when weak hands are out we will reach equilibrium and we will begin our ascension.

“Enter speculation here”
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:43:28
I would disagree because it wouldn’t be profitable to mine btc if the price was between 2k-4k hence the hard bottom of 6k
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:13:53
How? You are the one making them sell at a loss when all they have to do is wait.. who knows if its 6 months or 2 years but those people sold at hundreds of percentage points of a loss rather than thousands of points of gains bc YOU tricked them in selling their bitcoin back to the 1%

Well you have to think about it in perspective. A 60m buy order at market is fairly large. That order would not be able to be filled for the pure fact that most exchanges aren’t trading such high volumes. That is why these type of deals are done OTC even though this would be considered lower volume for OTC

You can either use coinbase or you can just find someone with bitcoin and exchange the bitcoin for money
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:07:09
You make a fair point on money growing on trees these past years. However, btc is continuously being adopted by someone new so if you don’t own bitcoin you won’t be profiting of new adopters. One day a great majority of people will own and use bitcoin and I can tell you right now the price is going to be nowhere near 20k even in a bear market. However, if you are investing non-expendable money you will run into problems whether its btc, gold, equities, etc.

Who do you think created religion? It was literally created by governments (i.e. catholicism by the vatican) to control people. Religion only has positive ethical points because people need an incentive to do the right thing or not do bad things (i.e. steal a cookie from the cookie jar and youll burn in hell). Do you want to know what governments use as a pretext for war almost 100% of the time? RELIGION.

Hopefully btc and other cryptocurrencies with allow for everybody to be financially free without the bureaucrats  making you fill out paperwork and taking your money.

Coinbase has monopoly on easily buying and selling btc. Its nice bc coinbase does exactly what they say they are going to do.

Im giving him some sensible investment advice. Btc is volatile enough that you could make 800% gains trading over the course of a few months. You don’t have to hodl to realize crazy percentage gains, you just have to hodl to get those percentage gains in one investment. You cleary don’t trade so I don’t know why you think you are giving someone sound investment advice.
