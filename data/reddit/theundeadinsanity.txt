Yes, and this is an issue with all investments, since your basis is not adjusted for inflation. This is one of the reasons why long-term capital gains tax rates are lower: to account for gains created solely by inflation.
Your argument doesn't support not taxing bitcoin. If anything, it supports adjusting cost basis for inflation.

Agreed, but you're missing the point. The inflation or deflation of USD does not change the amount of actual USD you possess. Has the purchasing power changed? Yes, but you don't get taxed on purchasing power.
On the other hand, the inflation or deflation of bitcoin does change how much USD you have. It is not just a change in purchasing power. It's a real change in wealth. Therefore, it gets taxed once you recognize that change.

It isn't taxed again. You are only taxed on the increase in value of the Bitcoin. If you originally purchased the Bitcoin for $10,000 and then sold it for $11,000, you would only get taxed on the $1,000.


Correct, because you still have $100. The value hasn't changed. The only difference is that you can't buy as much with the $100 as you could in 2008 (i.e. purchasing power has decreased). With Bitcoin you actually end up with more (or less) USD than you originally had.

This is just flat out wrong. The recipient of a gift rarely pays gift tax. It is the responsibility of the person making the gift. That being said, you'd have to gift over $11.4 million in your life before having to actually pay any gift tax.

It's up to $15,000 now, but your CPA is correct. You can gift $15,000 annually per person tax-free. Any gift above that is a taxable gift. You can make up to $11.4 million of taxable gifts during your lifetime before actually paying any gift tax.
The $15,000 is the annual gift exclusion. The $11.4 million is the lifetime gift and estate tax exemption.
