It is beta software.
It is even more risky than a beta wallet because a lightning node does transactions on your behalf, automatically.
A critical bug in software could allow an attacker to steal money from all active vulnerable nodes on the network.

Terribly wrong.
If your node stays offline for too long, you could potentially lose all your funds.
This is because people that have channels open with you could broadcast obsolete transactions.
When they do, your node would notice it and automatically publish a penalty transaction, protecting you from losing your funds.
If your node is not online to do that, you will lose your funds.
If you have open channels, your node must stay online.

The Globe And Mail did a [similar campaign]( 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:13:27
Really? It is common where I live. Some of them do crazy hours though. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:35:18
50 tickets and 100s of emails is crazy. Why did you do that? 
If I were you, I would write one good ticket with all the required information:
 - full name
 - account number
 - associated email
 - every other detail you have about the account
Then, be patient and wait at least two weeks for a reply.
You may have experience with other markets, but here with btc we have slow support due to the high volatility of the volume on the market, one day they have 10 tickets and the other day they get 1000. It's hard for them to have the right amount of staff.
I had a similar issue with them where I had enabled PGP encryption and email 2fa but my PGP key somehow didn't work in their system and I wouldn't receive my 2fa codes. I was effectively locked out of my account for over two weeks but they fixed it.

Can you tell us your story? How long have you waited and under what circumstances? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:34:19
However such services don't exist yet. The question above was about the current state of things and not some hypothetical future.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:44:23
Are you opening the ticket from their website or are you sending a mail somewhere?
I dealt with their support twice and have never gotten automated replies. I used their website to open my tickets.

Does not mean that the news are all bad. Let's say that it is very opinionated. It can also be intentionally misleading when it comes to BTC vs BCH. Have a look around the website for yourself and you will understand.

No, not just shops. Everyone with an open channel must stay online.
In the case of a channel you would open with a coffee shop, there should be no obsolete transactions that they can use to their advantage as they will always prefer the most recent transactions, where you owe them more money. Coffee shops typically don't issue refunds so there should be no transaction where they give money back to you.
However, with any other store, if you buy something and then get a refund (or cancel your order), the store can close the channel with the transaction just before the refund, effectively stealing you money.
So, in conclusion, you may go offline, but never do it unless you fully understand the state of all your open channels and whether or not they could be closed to your disadvantage.

There won't be many milestone to reach. It's all or nothing with lightning network.

Way to kill the hype 
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:43:27
Linux will always be the safest way, but Windows will be good too.
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:44:58
That is what I was looking for. 750k coins were not even moved lol.
@_date: 2018-10-14 15:46:35
Do I really have to check again to make sure at this point or can I just hop in for free? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:51:42
Secure yes.
Bitcoin isn't really anonymous. You can probably move your coins in a way that makes you as anonymous as possible but it is debatable whether or not other currencies can be moved the same way.
I think we need to focus on the strong advantages of Bitcoin and anonymity isn't one of them. We keep saying that everything can be traced whenever law enforcement complains about Bitcoin so let's get our story straight ;)

This service does not exist yet AFAIK and you still need to trust that it will do its job.
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:07:14
Bitcoin for president!

And how is mtgox going to transfer my btc in usd if not by selling it?
People would start flooding the merchant interface if it was the only possible way to sell 0.1btc. Pay themselves via API.
@_date: 2013-03-24 03:00:51
I should buy an offline printer? :P
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:11:13
I would not support this. I expect a highly efficient trading engine.
Using the API for small trades and automated systems will be a pain.
Lets say I sell WIFI and want to convert to USD for every fraction of BTC I get, I'll just switch to btc-e?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:38:32
How do I know you? Bitcoin IRC?
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:58:41
use your own scanner and print it?
@_date: 2013-09-13 04:31:07
Can I still have my wallet running on my computer?
Trezor will have an address of it's own?
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:41:28
I do day-trading so idc paying the first time really.
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:20:07
why dont you just get bitcoin in there instead?
I'm a canadian and I use virtex to get USD in mtgox. I buy BTC on virtex, transfer on mtgox and sell there.
