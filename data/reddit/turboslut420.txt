Can you explain why? Isn't it just a proposal that the bitcoin network can accept or decline by majority consensus and won't current coins still be usable? I understand why litecoin is an altcoin, but if the network votes in favor of some kind of change that is compatible with existing coins then isn't that apples and oranges?
*I would appreciate an answer here. I want to fully understand the issue. Lots of claims from both sides and I just want to get to the bottom of it all.
***Thanks to the people that actually answered my questions. I am a long holder since gox and I have never seen such a poor display of overall community behavior.

Outsiders looking in are seeing a large group of people responsible for the future of bitcoin that can't even appear to engage in honest and open discourse when communicating amongst themselves.
That is not the kind of impression you want to leave with observers if you want to gain their confidence to join the ecosystem themselves. Doesn't matter how much you feel that the other side is going to harm bitcoin, engaging each other with childish behavior on display for all to see the questionable character of the people behind bitcoin is indisputably bad for bitcoin.

Isn't this change conditional upon majority network consensus?

Can you maybe clear this up for me? Who is Blockstream, how are they related to the core devs, and what is their business model long term? What kind of truth is there to the idea that they have financial incentive to maintain a low blocksize?
(Really sorry to ask so many questions but I am shifting in one direction slowly and can hardly get a straight and informed answer from anywhere else)

And if such a thing did happen? You would essentially have to commit to one or the other permanently by either staying on core or moving your coins to XT?
I am really, really trying to get at the details of this here and cut through the bullshit so thanks for the reply.

Sorta Relevant Question: Does 51% of all mining power exist within China? Could it soon?

The current situation of two echo chamber subreddits that was necessitated by actions of the mods here has served to create a larger divide between the community which has reduced meaningful discourse to all time lows. Nothing but namecalling, over-the-top rhetoric, and circlejerking in either subreddit. 
I just want to hear arguments and counterarguments but both sides are so fucking hostile to genuine questions asking them about "their side" as though I am trying to discredit them that I have lost confidence that either side is acting transparently and in good faith.

Can you explain a bit more how this works?
@_date: 2015-12-27 21:32:29
That is quite the compelling idea you have there, it would be insane to do anything before determining the will of the economic majority. The idea of people having to choose permanently by jumping to one side or the other after a fork could end in a disaster (say core wins and 30% of the network is now mining junk coins after committing to XT).
What kind of insane person would want to be the first to make the jump possibly risking all of their coins? 
Am I understanding this all correctly? I have been a long holder since mtgox and I would hate to see a disaster undermine the entire experiment.

Good. Always wondered about the possibility of the Chinese government deciding to just seize 51% of the network one day.

The sad reality. We are our own biggest obstacles, always.

It is really quite the wormhole isn't it?

Both are real for the same reason, we agree they have value.

What if it is through a payment processor and the ATM owner is instantly converting to fiat? Does that still allow for the same approach?
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:14:38
Cool thanks
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:51:12
Because they didn't understand bitcoin until he showed them that it turns into fiat just like that.
When you first explain bitcoin to people they tend to think that it can't possibly have value because it doesn't even real.

Doesn't matter, address the content of the post and not the OP.

You seem to know whats up.
Unrelated question -- could you setup a btc atm to autobuy on an exchange at the time of the transaction or do you need to keep bitcoin on hand?

I certainly wouldn't feel obligated to pay for a debt that I was not responsible for creating and didn't agree to cosign on.
"No we don't, we don't owe you a thing" is the other most upvoted thread on this subreddit right now. Pick one or the other.

Off-topic - Seagate offers the program "Beyond 2TB" as the hard drive states but I haven't been able to get it to work with my 3 TB drive on Windows 10. Have you OP?

What is unknown is exactly where it will be in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. If you think you know otherwise, you should be on wall street and not on reddit.

Ok but it is very easy for the police to summon the offenders to them and arrest them then and there.

Can't you just do this on BTC-e by converting to altcoins and back?

Sort of on topic and if this informs just a single person it was worth the comment:
If anyone uses the encrypted messaging app "surespot" on their phone, that developer has recently stopped responding to canary questions that they traditionally had responded to regularly. You should stop using it immediately.

It's not. The network would correct any malicious action due to Chinese geo-centralization. You can count on that.
