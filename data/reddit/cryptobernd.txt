This is a pretty big deal, Savas and Sido are two of the rap kings in Germany (imagine Eminem and Snoop Dogg making a song about crypto).
This song made me curious because after listening it was clear to me that they know what they are talking about. So I wanted to know if it was ghostwritten or not and watched a 45 minute crypto interview with Savas, and the interviewer was the founder of TenX. They are definitely legit, Savas said they have a group of rappers who are all into crypto as they like the idea behind it. He said that of course he enjoys the "casino aspect" of crypto and has fun trading with alts and seeing his money increase and stuff but the true reason is the bigger picture, giving power back to the people and having a voice in how things are supposed to run etc. He basically wants a fuck you to the banks. He doesn't have one single favorite cryptocurrency, instead he is more about the idea that all of them represent and he doesn't care which one(s) "win" in the end.

I did, did you? Because of the various definitions out there, none of them have anything to do with limitation. All of them agree on the point that it's money with no intrinsic value, which is the case for Bitcoin as much as it is for USD or Euro or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:24:14
Translation: I lost the argument? Proof-of-work is artificial delay of block generation and consensus-mechanism, nothing more, nothing less.

No it doesn't, it means that it has value because people agree on it. The fact that the government enforces the value of government issued money is irrelevant. There are various definitions out there that will tell you this but none that tell you the opposite.
To not be FIAT money Bitcoin needs intrinsic value, which it doesn't have. That's the **only** attribute that differentiates FIAT money and non-FIAT money, the intrinsic value. An absence of such makes it FIAT money.

For example, the " defines it as "An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange".
What now? We have two definitions which are different.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:46:54
I agree, the intrinsic value of gold and such is arguable, things with clear intrinsic value are sacks of rice or coal which can feed you or keep you warm. Certain precious metals have application scenarios which could arguably give them intrinsic value (thermal conductivity for example).

There's a whole bunch of people who mined Bitcoin way early and simply forgot about it or lost their keys. I would've been one of them if I didn't give up on mining after 5 minutes because I was too lazy and bored to set it up.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:31:04


It's not. That's just one way of how the value of FIAT money can be **enforced**. It doesn't **have** to be enforced if people already agree on it by themselves without the inferference of a third party. There's various definitions that say this. You don't need FIAT money to be government issued and enforced.
EDIT: Source for the argument:
" defines it as "An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange".
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:55:32


In fact, FIAT money has only one characteristic and that is "no intrinsic value". Which is the case for Bitcoin. Ease of transfer, the ability to take it from you, etc. are all points that are irrelevant for the definition of FIAT money.
You like wikipedia? Okay then:
"An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange" &gt; the definition of FIAT money, as by wikipedia. So that clearly proves my point.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:30:06
That doesn't change the fact that you can use a blockchain as a data structure without decentralization and proof-of-work, it won't be decentralized but the contents will be secured just as well.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:53:14
You think it's a bad thing that I'm trying to argue that Bitcoin is FIAT money without the need of a government? You haven't gotten the point of this discussion at all.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:58:00
It's a discussion (as stated in the post) so I think we shouldn't have to add "I think" or "my opinion" etc. to every argument, it can come across that way. It's not intended.
Also I think this specific dictionary definition has some value to it because of 25 economy nobel prize winners involved. There are 1000s of definitions for any given topic on the internet, there will always be one that supports your position if you look hard enough. It's worth to consider where the definitions come from.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:28:39
Bags of rice used as payment aren't FIAT money because they have intrinsic value as they can feed you. Sacks of coal do too because they keep you warm. Gold, Diamonds, etc. are arguable because those things are mostly used in jewelry which doesn't have intrinsic value if all it's used for is being looked at. A lot of precious metals have application scenarios which arguably give them an intrinsic value.
But anyway my point is that it's wrong to refer to Bitcoin as something different from FIAT money because that would mean it has intrinsic value and it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:26:38
You're arguing something that's not the point here. If you use a blockchain without decentralization you can't "claim that" your blockchain is mine, because my blockchain isn't decentralized. There won't be any PoW. You can remove proof-of-work but still use blockchain as a data structure. It's still a secure and immutable database. It's simply not generated in a competitive environment by multiple people where you have to find consensus on which blockchain is the legit one. That doesn't change anything about how secure and immutable the content of the blockchain itself is.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:52:24
Agreed, but those scenarios are basically the 51%-attack equivalent of a decentralized blockchain, aka quite unlikely to happen. It's straying pretty far from the original argument of this comment chain where it was claimed that the hashpower of the Bitcoin blockchain and the access to the "most secure database" is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin which I don't think is the case since you can a) have your own database based on the same technology minus the decentralization and get the same value out of it and b) hashpower of decentralized Blockchains come and go which means it's not intrinsic.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:39:26
" defines it as "An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange".
Can you? It says nothing about government decree here. It's **optional** and is refered to that way because that's how most actual real-life implementations of FIAT money work. They don't **have** to work like that, like Bitcoin proves to us. We don't need a government to make FIAT money work.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:15:48
Yo what the fuck is wrong with you? Why is your whole comment history a cesspool of comments like the one you just posted? What's your goal? Are you mad because you lost money or something?
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:36:06
You're absolutely correct, I don't know if you're the same guy that I initially responded to but my argument was about a single database being secure, in which case I was arguing you can use a blockchain without proof-of-work and without decentralization just the same. Obviously it will be centralized and the "owner" of that database is a single point of authority and also a single point of attack, which can be bypassed by backups and whatnot. I was arguing about the content of the blockchain itself being able to be secure regardless if decentralized or not (even though a decentralized blockchain is rather useless). The main point however was that I was trying to say that hashpower  is not an **intrinsic** value of Bitcoin because it can come and go depending on how profitable it is to mine, so the ability of using the "most secure database" is not an intrinsic value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:15:02
You still haven't answered. Nothing I said there is wrong. If it is, prove it.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:41:40


" defines it as "An intrinsically useless object that serves as a medium of exchange".
OK? Why are you so aggressive?
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:09:20
FIAT money doesn't mean that it's forced on you, it means it's money without intrisic value, which is the case for Bitcoin. If the value isn't accepted by two parties (buyer and seller for example), then it **can** be enforced by a third party by decree. But FIAT money can exist without that decree which I'm arguing is the point for Bitcoin. We don't need governments to create our own currency out of nothing and assign value to it. It's wrong to argue against FIAT as something "bad" because of being FIAT. However it is bad if it is forced upon you. Which like you said isn't the case with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:05:25




Explain to me how this is wrong. I can recreate Bitcoin and have a database that is just as secure, by removing the competitive Proof-of-Work aspect. The cryptography will be exactly the same, the decentralization part will be gone but that part is not required to make it either secure or immutable.




This one makes no sense. It's no secret that miners go mine the coin that brings them the highest reward. It's common knowledge, when an altcoin becomes more profitable to mine, then the hashpower of Bitcoin goes down because miners switch to that altcoin. So it is like I said, hashpower is a result of the value, if the value sinks, so does the hashpower. The hashpower therefor is not an **intrinsic** value of Bitcoin.


Hence I said "theoretically". It's meant to point out that the haspower is not an intrinsic value, because intrinsic means it can't come and go, it always stays, that's not the case here.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:30:52
Yes, absolutely agree, but that's not what the person I responded to argued.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:43:44


Yes, you can, by simply doing exactly that. You can use a blockchain as a database without any other miners or decentralization involved, it won't require any hashpower, you can do it on your phone or a raspberry pi, and the information stored in that blockchain will be as secure and immutable as the actual Bitcoin blockchain. The only difference is that you're doing this by yourself and not in a competitive environment. And you don't need a competitive environment if all you want is a secure database.
You can argue that decentralization makes it more secure because there is no single point of attack, but you can also make 10 local offline backups of your database locally.
Proof-of-work doesn't make it secure, it only manages the consensus of which blockchain is valid in a decentralized system and handles block generation timings. If you want a secure database there won't be any issues of consensus in the first place because there will only be one database. You won't have to figure out which is the "correct" one. Security and immutability is unrelated to that.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:41:31
I'm saying I can use a blockchain for myself without letting anyone else be able to mine blocks for it, in which case the information in that blockchain is just as secure and immutable as in a decentralized blockchain. I get the same value out of it for myself. So your argument that being able to use the "most secure database" is an intrinsic value of Bitcoin isn't true, because a) I can use my own blockchain and have a database which is just as secure and immutable (but not decentralized) and b) the hashpower of a decentralized blockchain comes and goes depending on how profitable it is to mine, so the hashpower does not represent an intrinsic value but rather a reaction value which is a result of the value of Bitcoin. So we still don't have an intrinsic value for Bitcoin which means it's FIAT money.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:20:41
Yes, but FIAT money is not defined by having a finite amount. It's defined as something without intrinsic value which is the case for Bitcoin as much as a government issued currency. The limitation of having a maximum supply is irrelevant for the definition.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:38:09
Then actually think what you think I said is wrong rather than making empty statements with no content.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:46:13
Finally something I can agree with, so far everyone has been jumping down my throat. I think the original reason for the many, many definitions of "government issued decree" that you can find about FIAT money is that up until Bitcoin's creation, it wasn't even thinkable that someone simply creates something digital out of thin air and gets people to agree on a (high) value, without a government being involved (after all, why should anyone). Bitcoin has changed that because of the things the technology offers, which got people to agree on a value because they saw value in the technology itself without the need of the government to enforce this... even if it's made up of "nothing".
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:49:50


That's the argument that is mostly used for why Bitcoin isn't FIAT currency. But it's not true. The database can be created to be just as immutable and secure without Proof-of-Work. Also, the amount of hashpower in Bitcoin is a result of it's value on exchanges, not the other way around. So the "resource" behind the Bitcoin blockchain can increase/decrease as market supply/demand changes. The hashpower could theoretically go down to 0 and then those attributes that you just listed are not given anymore. They aren't intrinsic, they are a result of the price of Bitcoin.
