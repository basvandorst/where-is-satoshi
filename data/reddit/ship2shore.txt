Can you explain the mining with a graphics card?

How does a computer work? "ah you plug it in, and ah turn it on...". Come on man I'm a total eejit on this... Are bitcoins just floating around the cyber space? What does it mean to "mine"? Is it taking other people's btc like shaving off a percentage that doesn't get used?

And that's the glaring reason why it will not reach the masses, people won't invest when they know they are left behind.

I'm positive they do, hence why every second person is super posi and encouraging others to buy in "don't worry you don't even have to buy a full coin!". Obviously not shills, but they sure are selling it, perhaps out of fear and not genuine encouragement for people to "get rich". The only value comes from more people buying in, so it reeks of desperation in here. Not that that's a bad thing, I've got my 1 singular BTC, just the same as any other shares I've invested in, which could turn into junk overnight. I'm keeping a finger in the pie, but it's hyperbolic bs, it's an extremely small specific demographic that utilises this, people are convinced their  grandma is going to be buying in tomorrow. She won't, ever...

Yeah exactly, the point is there is a very large portion of the market who will not adapt, and they will suffer, in turn creating the same poverty it was trying to avoid. Not exactly sure how it helps local economy either. Japan being the biggest investor by far, and also owning the most debt of any nation on earth. That in itself is telling.

Can I please tax it then? No? Oh, well, we are going to have some problems then.

In all honesty, why would the masses bother when they are so far behind already?

I've got 10k from a $600 investment. Why would Joe blow next to me buy 1 for 10k just to catch up to me? He can't, it's not feasible.
