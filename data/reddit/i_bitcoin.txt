I wonder if it would be beneficial to use the IETF.   They have much experience in documenting protocols and conflict resolution on same.   
Of course there are numerous examples where things fell apart but also some pretty good examples that keep the Internet functioning.

It is indeed interesting.   In fact, I can see a lot of potential value in this and a way forward that breaks the impasse we see with the core developers on block size (I have seen this in person :)).    Key questions.
1. Has this idea been thought through already?   See bitcointalk or chat it up on github.   I don't claim to know everything but I do know that I have not seen this idea before.
2. If 1. has not been thought through then spend a few minutes writing up the idea and pushing for it.   It could get a lot of traction quickly.
Key challenge would be maintaining a synchronized list, or lists.   This type of protocol is relatively straightforward to develop but would add complexity.   Nice thing is that it seems quite likely to NOT require a hard fork and would improve block propagation speed for the adopters without fundamentally changing the protocol.   Long run it would have everyone shift to the "agreed" sync method so they can get speed and would then allow for large blocks as propagation is "equal' for all.
Latency is not necessarily a big issue but it does require sufficient memory.   Memory pressure is likely much easier to deal with vs. speed of large block propagation.
Let me know if you need help.   I have done similar work in the past but not for bitcoin.

2. Open phone app
3. scan QR code

After that the little dialog box typically goes away fast (this is very cool) and I get to the next stage of the order process.

Interestingly, if you try to buy 5 billion worth you would drive the market up like a freight train.   It would take you years to buy without driving costs up astronomically and then collapsing when the other end sells.   
Now, if we look at this in a few years the story should be quite different.

We still don't have hard evidence of insolvency.   What is his opinion of all the exchanges making that statement "mtgox is insolvent"
I would, personally, focus on the positive of removing a bad actor (or at least poorly managed one) from the system.    You should also ask him about all the mtgox problems over the years.   There have been many screw ups by mtgox and it is good to have them out of the system.

It is best if you find a complete cycle of bitcoin where possible.     In other words, if the creator of the value (service or product) accepts you are in the best shape.
Anytime more people are involved you are best off.   Look for people who have taken the time to integrate Bitcoin into their product/service sales and give them as much love as possible.

If you read the post from gliph it seems that the major objection is that bitcoin is not legal everywhere.   has anyone tried to find out a way to localize to places where it is legal and make that argument?

1. you can't spend what you don't have as the protocol does not allow it.
2. Watch for double spends (similar to credit card tech)
1. Use multiple addresses, mixers, etc...
2. Are articles written about the dollar unethical if you don't disclose your stake?   Assume everyone has a stake.
3. Yes, it is illegal but may be unenforceable in some cases.   See your fraud and computer crime statutes for some ideas

A very good read and makes a lot of sense.   Thinking further it seems that quite a few 100s of addresses would need to be used to drive salary inputs down closer to cup of coffee level.
From that thinking it then seems like it would grow the number of outputs required for a large transaction.   This would make it more costly in the blockchain WRT size of tx.   Probably okay if the average tx size is contemplated.  Economics will probably drive this :)

No idea, I quite like it.   Coindesk also does something similar but not a global weighted average.   It certainly helps smooth things out.
Not that we can always trust all the exchanges to self report so perhaps global weighted average is not a good representation for any particular individual.   Stacking the API is a constant point of paranoia in the community :-)

Let me create a gazillion of my own coins and sell them to you.

True...   But perhaps this is not worth it?   you know?   Just use atmospheric static as your RNG or get a bunch of monkeys to mash on keyboards.   
In fact, you can have a lot of fun with that...   Get real monkeys to mash on keyboards or devices to generate randomness.   It could be the monkey lotto.   You might laugh or think this is crazy but really.   This type of thing gets people interested!

Not so sure...  Looks nice but searching for them brings up the word scammer in a pretty big way.   Anyone have good experiences?

If Fleetham is working towards neutrality then maybe the positive spin on articles is pushing her to balance every positive with a negative.   How about taking everything above the table of contents and making it as neutral as possible?
I would take the below and sprinkle it all below the TOC so that it does not immediately set the tone.   Let the opening and closing sections be as neutral as possible.

heck, I am going to go write a python script to implement this and go to the zoo tomorrow.  Or maybe I can borrow the neighbors cat and use this rheostat I have.

Sheesh, downvoted just because of the title?  Go to the website and check it out first.

I would not use external factors provided by your gamers even if they are theoretically random.   Toss your own numbers instead.  They are going to have to trust you no matter what you do anyway.

Yea, maybe it is just bad SEO on their part but you can never be too sure.

Apple can beaten up by Gov'ts.    With dollars it is the population that gets beaten down for bringing the dollars in to a country (Argentina for example).   Apple can just be prevented from doing business and they lose an entire market.

&lt;Shrugs&gt;, I always assume that the author of what I read wants me to do something favorable for the author.   only thing I semi-trust is peer reviewed papers published in reputable journals.   I say semi-trust as we have found some pretty painful evidence there as well.

Whoever is segregated will fork.   Whichever area has the most mining power will be the longest chain and the fork will die off.

You don't even have to wait for the first confirmation in most situations.   It is helpful though if you have a very large amount.
That first confirmation should be plenty for you to be able to forward that transaction along to someone else, for example.

Worth storage is one of the key technologies to be sure.   As ease of use grows and we develop a larger and more stable dev community the applications are much more broad though.   Quite simply we are going to reach a new era of financial technology and Bitcoin, or it's derivative works over time, will drive it.
Bitcoin itself is very very scalable as well.   Each of the concerns we have today is addressable given a motivated and engaged development community.   We need to get closer and closer to IETF style (BIPs are an example) so that we can scale this sucker.

I read this and have only one thing to say...
Why not just make these web pages and do it all remotely?  Not quite as cool as having it local to your phone but still.

It depends on time of day and when the API is actually working.   for example, today it was quite slow because BTCchina API was down

Key point right there.  Plan on just the smart phone users having it.   What would that number be?  Realize they would need/want enough for store of value/savings as well as remittance and to use for shopping.   Seems like a pretty scary large number.

Check out the new changes to their site.   Very happy to see folks giving back.   Perhaps self serving of them but we do want people to have a simple/pleasant experience learning about bitcoin.
