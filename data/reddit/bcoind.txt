I think it's the fact that bitcoin wallets would present a uniquely appealing target.
Banks presumably use all manner of defences that they've evolved over decades of dealing with external threats.
If you can sneak some malicious code into a popular wallet, it will find its way onto thousands of PCs, many owned by not particularly tech-savvy users. Then, at the click of a button, you steal a huge sum of money anonymously, untraceably, and disappear.

Because anyone could get involved anonymously and contribute code?

Good info. Can I ask though, is it really so rare to contribute to open source projects anonymously? I thought the OS world was full or shadowy bedroom programmers known only by their user names...?

I think this comes closest to addressing my original question, thanks.

I get that it's not wikipedia, I guess my concern is that any new contribution would have to be vetted by others in the group, and that it's down to each project to decide how diligently this is done.

Why the hell is this getting downvoted? I'd never heard of the underhanded C contest before and it strikes me as extremely relevant to the topic at hand here.

I know, but does anyone actually do this? I code a little, and know how time consuming it is to decipher code that I wrote myself 6 months ago. Are there really &gt;0 programmers spending their weekends trawling through other peoples' bitcoin wallet code?

Yes. At the moment bitcoin effectively rewards people for digging precious resources out of the ground and burning them. It's unsustainable. A system that rewarded productive work would be infinitely better for everyone.
