As I said multiple times the transaction went through after 3 days. After that there were no delays withdrawing crypto.

It eventually worked after 3 days. Since then I can buy BTC and ETH instantly and send them relatively quick. I changed to other exchanges though since Coinbase doesn't support Segwit and charges high transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:31:15
You can take a look at  but they take pretty big fees afaik.

I don't know where you live but bitcoin futures on CBOE will launch at 5pm central, either you short before on bitmex or sell now (if you think bitcoin futures will trigger a panic sell). 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:29:08
There are enough exchange services where you can buy bitcoin and send them into your wallet in unter 2 hours. E.g.  They are not the best/cheapest service but they are fast :)

If you have the wallet.dat your are fine, if the file is not corrupted in some way. You can check here: 
You don't have to use Omniwallet.org. As soon as you have your private key you can import it on any wallet you want to use

If you want to invest such amounts of money I would advise to get a hardware wallet like Trezor or a Ledger Nano S.
Them just get a site from here and buy some BTC: 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:41:30
Glad everything went fine, never had problems with them so far :)

Buying Bitcoin with Paypal is very hard since Paypal basically hates Bitcoin. The only method I know is buying from Linden$ on VirWox and trade them to Bitcoin. (VERY high fees)
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:19:38
Check if the folder C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin or C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Roaming\Electrum exists. Maybe you have your wallet file saved there.

This video should be titled: Why you should NOT invest in anything.

Well if you want to fly to another country and need to exchange money you still do it even though the country has billionaires right?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:27:38
No these are basically multiple wallets. Every address on there has 1 private key to sign transactions. If you want to gift those away you print one, send BTC to the displayed address and give it to someone. They can scan the private key and will have permanent access to the corresponding bitcoin address.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:23:02
I would rather sell now and buy back on monday. Nobody can predict the future but I'll rather miss out on a 1k price increase than holding against a 5k decrease.

For bandwith I only can say that my full node is using ~130 GB traffic total per day. If the traffic would increase by 8x my server wouldn't be able to run other web services, though I don't know if an 8 times block size increase also increases the traffic by that multiplier.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:26:31
Most people only buy bits of bitcoin. There is absolutely no problem with that, only invest the money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:42:56
It literally says bitfinex-coldwallet on the website :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:36:33
 is reachable for me. Maybe check your DNS settings?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:42:01
Yes, I contacted support but they haven't answered till today. I waited and it went through. All follow up withdrawals went through instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:53:45
Why XRP though? What are the advantages of XRP over Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:37:52
Do you really think people will throw money at this? :D
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:19:31
NEVER post these online. You just gave everyone your private key and access to those paper wallets. I hope these are not yours :)
I think you mean your private key. It's basically the key to access the printed bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:05:32
BitMEX is pretty straight-forward. You can deposit BTC and for newbies you can just click Sell market and you have a short contract running. If you use leverage you have to be careful because you could be liquidated (lose all money you bet) if the price rises. I'll send you a PM, I can guide you through the process if you use my reflink ;)
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:24:29
Sure, you can either wait for the chain to be completely downloaded or dump your private key and use it on blockchain.info, so you won't have to download the entire blockchain
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:31:03
What do you mean by wallet ID? The Bitcoin adress? Or the wallet.dat file?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:47:04
IMO blockchain.info is good for that. You can download the App and just scan the QR Code with your smartphone. The account creation is straight-forward and the app has a easy to use UI :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:32:03
It would be a 50 times increase to $50 would be $2500 and $100 would be $5000
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:18:22
No. You should do the opposite: Just keep them in a private Bitcoin wallet where you hold the private keys. After the fork you will be able to use your Bitcoin private key to access any Bitcoin-forked wallet, where you will hold the same amount of coins, which you held at the time of the fork.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:21:13
Explain how BCash's "technology" is better. They just have a bigger blocksize which will increase centralization and they removed SegWit, which is a technological step backwards.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:53:13
And they can easily manipulate the price to rise. If you put a long at 11200$ for a few millions and buy a shitton of bitcoin you probably make a profit :S. Same thing goes for shorting/selling bitcoins, but someone has to buy them first to sell them later :D
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:28:31
Those are old news :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:16:00
I've googled a bit and stumbled upon this project on github: 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:47:42
Not on CBOE but on BitMEX. Short bitcoin to 10k or something, buy more bitcoin and wait til 100k$/BTC next year :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:53:18
The sad thing is I had problems with most exchanges in the last weeks. The most reliable exchange in terms of deposits/withdraws was Bittrex, but you can only use Tether/ETH/BTC to buy other coins.
I will try Gemini next, since some people recommended it on @_date: 2017-12-04 22:31:43
It depends on how much bitcoin you send into those wallets. A newly generated paper wallet is empty. If you send bitcoin to the printed address, there is bitcoin in that address. Once you "redeem" or use the key the address is NOT lost and you can continue to use it. Although I would not advice to use a bitcoin address which has been printed and seen by more than yourself :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:03:02
Yes. But you can trade futures with leverage so if you have 100 million dollars, you can probably buy some long contract with 50x leverage and then just buy bitcoins for 50 million dollars. If everything goes smooth you have bitcoins worth 50 million and you can sell your contracts for 30-40 million. (This is not too likely but theoretically it is possible)
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:27:38
Well you can short with 100-1000x leverage and will not double you money but 1000x your money :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:13:57
If you want to hold your bitcoins long term it doesn't really matter. The price in one year will be much higher than the current price. You can wait for a drop in price but if it never comes you will ask the same question when 1 BTC is at 30000$. So just buy some BTC and wait :)
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:35:13
Having the same issue. Account is restricted and no response from support in 3 weeks. Switched to bitpanda and had no issues so far, although fees seem pretty high.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:53:55
I like your layout, but the BTC price is stuck at 10$ :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:19
You can split bitcoins down to 0.00000001 BTC. So there is no problem buying bitcoin with 2000 USD :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:14:48
Did you use an online wallet? Maybe 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:07:13
It's never too late to get into Bitcoin :) Glad I could help!
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:13:21
You can check out BitMEX ( You can go long/short with up to 100x leverage if you want.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:14:44
at h you can use your BTC to short and long on cryptocurrencies. You can use up to 100x leveradge (which is pretty risky) :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:03:30
I don't know if I understand you correctly but you are basically using your btc to trade bitcoin futures. It's some contract stuff so you don't trade "real" bitcoins but you get paid in real bitcoin when buying/selling contracts.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:59:37
You probably used the blockchain.info wallet. Check  and try to recover your wallet with your super long passphrase :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:36:40
Currently this is a paradise for future trading. Made 0,03 btc to nearly 0,6 in one day :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:39:40
The easiest way to obtain bitcoins by mining is using  IMO. You don't necessarily mine bitcoins, but their client will calculate the most viable coin to mine for your hardware. When you start mining you get paid in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:09:03
Prior to what? Most other sites say that before you deposit money. They informed me after I already bought the BTC so my money is already spent. I think they should ask for Verification before you can deposit money so users who need the BTC fast don't waste money on their service.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:06:24
You can daytrade at BitMEX with up to 100x leverage  (hope this is allowed)
Never go 100x though because you will be liquidated extremely fast :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:13:24
Why would the government receive no taxes? They can easily regulate Bitcoin by only having people register their Bitcoin adresses with the state. Only transactions from registered adresses are legal. This would kinda destroy a big part of Bitcoin but it is possible.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:25:25
They are ALL HIYP's. Seriously check  there are AT LEAST 20-30 Programs popping up every day, mostly by the same scammers under different names. Seriously watch out, they will most likely scam you. If you get in early you sometimes make your money back + 20-50% but IMO it's not worth it :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:33:59
Basically yes, this is called arbitrage. You have to consider that the average Bitcoin transaction takes 60 minutes, so prices could change in that time.

I used my credit card and the deposit on money went fine. The problem is after I bought BTC and tried to withdraw them to my wallet the withdrawal got delayed for 3 days. If I knew that beforehand I wouldn't even bothered since I needed the BTC relatively quick.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:09:52
You could use Monero. AFAIK transactions and adresses are private/hidden.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:33:41
Those sites are high yield investment programs. Most of them shut down after a few days - weeks. If you want to risk losing your money you can try it. Sometimes you even make some money but I would advise to not trust such sites :)
