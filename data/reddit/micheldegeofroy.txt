No its spying and making wars in cooperation with US industrial and banking interest groups to create income and strategic commercial advantages and then making the countries on the receiving end on this politics foot the bill ... War on Communism, War on Drugs, War on Terror

Personally I'm confident that not only the US army is not only the most powerful but also the most active, well trained and the one with the most strategic overseas bases let alone its massive nuclear deterrent.
Interesting article but I personally think that the first US move to position it self as the world currency is it's alliance with the Al Saud and its investment in weapon systems with long range offensive capabilities built during the cold war this dethroned the Sterling.
Yes obviously I am also speculating but yes I would agree but for the moment its reinforcing its global position financing wars and then will move in for the kill.

Thanks for your point of view it has forced me to think things more in depth

Ok so since you seem to be an expert what would happen if the NSA would get into mining Bitcoins ? would they in effect have the potential power to have a monopoly on the bitcoin supply ? would that not equate to one entity having control over all world gold mines ?

Hmm Interesting thanks for pointing it out was not aware, but what is the difference ? any links thanks 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:11:24
1) The USD dollar is already worthless 
2) I do believe that the NSA has the most GHs on the planet at this time which from a mining perspective puts it in control
3) I will get back to you on this one with a concept that details this idea
4) I never said easy just quoted you
I will leave the rest to differences of opinion thanks for the feed back :)

well we are well beyond theoretical concerning quantum computers

The only competition in sight is China and they are backing out of bitcoin because they also understand the GHs potential of the USA Gov
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:31:06
Is it not that the one who has the most GHs has the highest probability to mine a block ? thus control of supply ? am I missing something ? and even if one wanted to hide this position of strength could split the mining operation ?

it's generally known as a "currency shift" another example would be to print dollars to pay people to mine gold (love your hint's)
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:49:33
hmm I see their ability to make the world pay for their wars as a great strength "dollar supports wars that supports the dollar"

You are correct it is pure speculation but if it is not an undisclosed reality yet it will be soon
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:50:54
I think you are flawed what keeps the USA Standing is the US army (if it's not the most powerful world army which one is?) and its ability to protect and impose the USD as the world "reserve" currency and the unit of purchase of oil (USD not the sole unit but by far the dominating unit of purchase  without the power tool they could print as much money as they wanted it would be by now equal to the zimbabwe dollar. 
I will update post to acknowledge that the USD is not the sole unit of purchase of oil

Its only worth the trust we put in it of the power of the us to in force it the gold of fort Knox even if it's still exist is a ridiculous amount compared to the debt which is all it is at present time.

Merging the USD and bitcoin is easy just use USD to pay for the powering and manufacturing of bitming computers until the USD is worthless effectively shifting all USD value to bitcoins mined.

1) The US is printing dollars out of thin air and can continue to do so as long as it wants so for the moment it has in effect infinite resources.
2) Even with fewer than half of bitcoin mined it would still have a monopoly on the mining of bitcoins thus giving it control of fluidity and price.
3) The NSA could easily hide its 51% advantage by breaking the mining operation down.
4) As you pointed out yourself they could do a 51% attack easily and since the money supply is not an issue neither is the cost barrier.
5) Even if Bitcoin owners would migrate to another crypto currency probably at a great loss this would not stop the scenario from repeating itself.
6) Even if bitcoin owners would switch crypto currency using a "proof of burn" process to as you say  "approximate the coin distribution from the original blockchain" that would not stop the US gov to follow into the new crypto currency and still dominate.

1)First of all it's not suicide since having the most computing power it would control supply it would not lose to counterfeiting could double spend and  since the blockchain is a public ledger its not even anonymous so could probably make tax evasion a thing of the past.
2)We are presently seeing a power struggle between the Bankers and the Government for full control of the dollar so to say that the Us Gov controls the USD is untrue but obviously it could change that quite fast.

this is a platform to pay in BTC when you own BTC many people want to be paid in btc by people that do not own BTC hence the platform needed is exactly the opposite as card.bit
@_date: 2016-02-10 00:57:53
I think that as soon as the opportunity to pay in bit coin is made easy  i.e. with credit card or paypal then people will start being paid in BTC and the economy will shift.
@_date: 2016-02-10 01:02:29
One of the advantages of being paid in btc is that its not very transparent and that it gives the receiving person the choice to declare that transaction or not ... the moment you receive anything except cash,btc or gold the operation is traced and has to be declared ...
