the section "Block rewards won’t last much longer." well if theres no transaction fees then miners will sell/use the BTC they get from blocks they mine. if the demand causes the price to dip lower than the cost of operating their mines then they wont sell which causes the available supply to go down but that should keep the price higher. Do you even Supply and demand bro?
