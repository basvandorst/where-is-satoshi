In brief, I would like to form a team of programmers to develop a mechanism with existing technology that automatically gives politicians bitcoin when they reduce taxes, spending, and budget deficits, and that takes away their bitcoin when they do the opposite. The participating politicians can earn more by doing more and by investing more. The programmers will earn bitcoin as a portion of the contributions from interested parties - those who would like to see less of big brother.

No. Justice is when the victim is made whole at the expense of the tortfeasor. No one else - except any agent selected by the victim - needs to be involved. Justice determined by the collective can never meet the direct needs of the victim.

**ReTRN** (Restitution Transfer and Recoupment Network) aims to provide a fully decentralized system of justice funded by tortfeasors (Free to victims). Its aim aligns with DAMN. Collaborate?
