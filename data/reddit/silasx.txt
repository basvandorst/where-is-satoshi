True.  I don't think it fits the bubble template.  That's an unhelpful misuse of language.
But I think there are relevant parallels, like how the Fed's assets are tenuous: it bought up a ton of dubious securities with no easy way to unwind the position and stay solvent.  Still not a bubble, but dangerous all the same.

It's only a problem in the sense that *any* energy consumption is a problem if and when you aren't pricing in the externalities.  Once this happens, people will continue to mine bitcoin, probably at a lower rate, and it will still be a lot, because it's more economical than some other uses of that energy.
And the same is true for all the other stupid uses of energy, like showy sports cars.

GDP is *usually* correlated stuff we care about.  I was objecting to GDP decline *in and of itself* -- did you see the next sentence? If the numbers go down, but we collectively "still produce the stuff people want in a sustainable way", then the economy hasn't been hurt *in a sense that I care about*.

That seems to be mostly orthogonal to Bitcoin though.  I mean, he's predicting the use of strong (public key) encryption to conceal transactions -- Bitcoin doesn't do that.
But let's be generous and assume he meant strong cryptography and was referring to signatures. Still true, but that's not what bitcoin adds; what it adds is the elimination of having to trust an intermediary, by a solution to the byzantine generals problem, which makes the assumption that honest players contribute most of the computing power.
This is just a general list of things that a good private currency will have.

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:24
Hm, I see a lot of good responses but none getting at the core issue.
Basically, there are lot of dynamics at play.  A successful, scalable LN would mean fewer on-chain transactions and lower demand to pay on-chain fees.  But it would also massively increase the utility of Bitcoin, and make them more valuable. So what they lose in fees they gain in market value.
Also, as mining profitability ebbs and flows, new mines come on and off the market.  If profitability goes down, that scares off miners and it goes back up again.

It's a rip on BCH. The analogy is:
"solve the problems of needing more transactions by having bigger blocks" -&gt; "solve the problems of needing more pizza by having a bigger pizza"
"I don't care that this makes the demands of running a node too large for most people, resulting in centralization" -&gt; "I don't care that this makes the pizza's too big to fit through most people's doors."

However, we have to be even-handed about this: most of us made the same error back when BTC was well under capacity (up to about 2015), and that's what inspired the Western Union parody that's banned here.

Numerous instances of sloppy reasoning.  One of many examples:




So, if you use a credit card, you can do the transaction within an agreed-upon mediation system that resolves disputes.  But if you use Bitcoins, you somehow can't attach third-party escrows/mediators, but must immediately jump to using clumsy government courts?
Completely invalid comparison.  Both centralized and decentralized payment systems can include or exclude private mediation systems.  Yet somehow only with Bitcoin do you have to rely on government courts when a transaction is disputed?

Contrary to the article, I think that the collapse of **Bernie Madoff's investment fund** is entirely the fault of the **US Dollar**. As a **mere banknote**, it requires third parties to operate the services nesecesary for a currency to exist (exchanges, shops, services, ect..). Since there is no official platform as such, some degree of trust is always going to be put in the hands of third parties.
70% of the people here rely on the continued operation of sites such as **Amazon, Overstock,** and all of the other banks and exchanges. The change machines themselves are already becoming third parties.
These failures in **the US Dollar** represent the fundamental failures of the **US government**. If there is no **government money-changer** then private corporations will take over the roles from the government.

The dollar *as such* is only *designed* to protect against counterfeit.  Blaming the US Dollar's design for Madoff is nonsensical -- that's not inside the dollar's threat model.

This may be heresy here, but I don't think Bitcoin is at the point yet where it's an important future skill.  Maybe cryptocurrencies in general would work, but I think even better idea would be to teach them about cryptographic primitives, and how they used to solve real-world, practical problems.  Background: [what is cryptographically possible](
Teach them that it's not just about sending secret messages.  For example...
1) Let's say you've solved a riddle and you want to prove you solved it while your opponent Jimmy was still working on it.  How do you do it?  How do you stop Jimmy from saying "yeah, that's what I was gonna say too!" if you can't trust the judges?
Answer: one-way functions (hash functions) and bit commitment.  This can lead to a discussion of how passwords are stored in a way that keeps snooping eyes from reading your database and learning how to break into someone's account.
Perhaps set up a site where they can try to invert a hash, either by breaking the hash function, or by brute forcing it.  (i.e. let them submit guesses and see what they hash to).  Start with something like the ["cow-chicken" hash]( to prime their intuition for what a hash function needs to accomplish.
2) That can lead to an intro to "proof of work" problems, which have applications in preventing spam (in addition to Bitcoin).  Show you can generate unique problems on the fly that require a predictable amount of effort to solve.
3) Talk about digital signatures: how you can generate a string that's unique to you and a message you want to sign, doesn't use paper, and can't be forged.
Together, that would also help them understand Bitcoin, which is itself a merger of several cryptographic protocols plus a novel solution to the Byzantine Generals problem.  It will also get them thinking about how to set up protocols to prevent cheating and reduce the need to trust a central party.

Another [example]( of trying to untangle a claim about "deflation is bad because of volatility because of deflation", where they insist that I would understand the circular logic if only I got up to speed on the ultra-complex serious economics ... which turns out to be "we need inflation so we can get people to spend", an argument I've long been aware of.

- required to pay taxes in it!!!
- regulated by a real central bank!!!
- inflationary!!!

I see it as a good refutation to the ridiculous meme going around that "lol consumers are teh real job creatorz", i.e. that somehow the mere act of consuming creates jobs, which is technically true but in the most misleading way possible.
It's not that "hey, people want cars twice as much, so we hire twice as many people".  No. That's not what entrepreneurs do (and would actually indicate *poor* scaling).  The recognize non-obvious combinations of inputs and outputs that allow resources to be utilized well.
They don't just sell more stuff when aggregate demand goes up, leaving them to the mercy of some mindless consumer.  They recognize that they could be giving you a car when previously you thought horses were the only option.  They recognize that you don't need a master mechanic to build cars, but can break the process into simpler components that involve under-utilized labor.

For me, the sports explanation works best when explaining it to other people.
Imagine a game (say, football), but with a few modifications.
First, there are many teams instead of two, and the game doesn't end.
Second, teams can give points to other teams.
Right there, you've answered the question about "where points come from" and "why can't you just copy yours" -- because, like in sports, the points come from people's collective recognition of who owns them.
Third, the rules for scoring are different.  If you want to get points (without being given them by another team), you have to solve a puzzle.  That puzzle is generated uniquely from the set of all transactions you've seen.  That is mining: attempting to get some of the new coins by being the fastest at solving this puzzle.  Users recognize the validity of the points earned this way for the same reason they recognize the validity of a given score in football.
So why do the mining at all?  To ensure that everyone agrees on 1) which transactions happened, 2) in which order (to prevent double spending).  It ensures this because the "game" has more rule: you trust the transaction ledger with the most work invested in it.  And when a puzzle is solved, it proves that a certain amount of (computational) work has been invested in a given ledger.  As more solutions are found, that "block chain" (as it's called) accumulates more and more proven work invested in it (you count the work of previous solutions on the ledger you're updating). So it's readily identified by other users as "the real thing".
There, shortest explanation I can give that conveys the critical intuitions.  The rest is just the stuff about "yes, crypto lets you do unforgeable signed transactions and proofs of work".

The cost means "if I could buy any amount of computation at the current nicehash rate, this is how much I would have to pay for an hour of that much computation".
Of course, that wholly depends on whether NiceHash has enough capacity.  Once you start exhausting that supply you'll quickly find out how much more you'll have to pay to get the rest.
That's why they have the last column: it indicates how much of the attack you could get if you used all of NiceHash's power.  For BTC, NH can only give you 1% of it.  You have to get 99x as much from other sources.

America has the Social Security system.  States and localities have pension funds for government employees that make investments of varying volatility.
It's just that there's no national system for prudent long-term pension investing.  (There are 401ks and 403bs but there's individually managed and very limited in what they can invest in.)  Instead, our Social Security system -- something intended to be invested for the extreme long-term -- is invested 100% in low yield, special class bonds with no coupling to the issuer's credit rating.

The mods keep me from making submissions about it, but if you had bitcoins in your own wallet as of August 1st of this year, you're *already* at almost $10k/bitcoin, if you HEDL since then!

Right, that's what I'm talking about -- it's currently impractical to short-sell, which is propping the price up (or rather, kept from being pushed down).

It's saying that there's a mining pool with 18% of the total BCH mining power that switches from BTC to BCH whenever the latter is profitable, but then only puts 1 megabyte of transactions in the blocks it solves/publishes, even when there's a blacklog of transactions?

I would very much appreciate you doing that, if you're interested! PM me for the redacted phone number if you want it.
Here's the message they sent me: (and sorry, turns out it was Coinbase, not Gemini).
Dear &lt;my name&gt;,
A transaction has posted to your account involving CoinBase.com (Bitcoin). Please be advised that in an effort to protect your credit union and all our members, A+FCU does not allow transactions involving CoinBase or any virtual currency. If you attempt to conduct any future transactions involving virtual currency, your account may be subject to closure.
Some of the reasons A+FCU has chosen to refuse virtual currency transactions are:
- Virtual currencies have a higher risk for fraud.
- Virtual currencies have no consumer protections.
- Virtual currencies are not backed by a government or central bank.
- Virtual currencies are targets for hackers, who have been able to breach sophisticated security systems in order to steal funds.
- Virtual currencies can cost you more to use than credit cards or even regular cash once you take exchange rate issues into consideration.
For more information regarding virtual currency, please refer to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) website at cfpb.gov or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) website at ncua.gov.
If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact us at &lt;phone number&gt;.

It's an issue of costs and benefits.  Changing my CU's policy just so you won't be wrong and I can get money out of Gemini without having to opening an account at Schwab isn't worth my time.

Not quite: the defining part of modern banking is that it's *expected* that they loan your savings out, and that you don't have the right to sue them over doing that.  Or for otherwise failing to have your money available -- the FDIC, not property law, guarantees that.
(Yes, somehow we got to the point where deposits are treated differently from coat check tickets.)
Now, if we got the point that people were trading MtGox receipts (claims to BTC held with them) on par with in-protocol BTC, *then* they would have real motive to print more claims than they can back, and we might have the same thing all over again.
Except, of course, that individuals can refuse the receipts and actually distinguish them from the real thing, allowing people to "opt out" of a bubble.

I recently had a mini crisis with my credit union over this; I got a transfer (for authentication) from CoinBase that triggered a nasty automated PM to my account on their site, which said:
- why virtual currencies are dangerous and
- why they don't want anything to do with them, and
- how they might close my account if they see more of that 
Unfortunately, I had since made a big transfer from Gemini before reading it.
I explained my situation and called their compliance department, which took the position that "Well, we won't close your account, but please stop doing this."
I asked some friend and the consensus seems to be that Schwab and Bank of America (ironically enough) don't do this and will be cool with transfers from Bitcoin exchanges.

My point was that they're the same an apples to apples basis. If you're not holding the physical gold, but rather, a claim to it, then a crash can destroy it just like Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-03-22 18:30:50
Right, but I just covered the basics in a sentence.  All you would need to explain then, to get more technical, is *why* the mining proves that the latest ledger entry ("block") has the most work invested in it.  (It's because finding the partial hash inversion is only possible by grinding through a bunch of guesses, thus proving that the network calculated a certain number of hashes for that update.)
There seems to be this belief that your only options are an extremely technical explanation that few can follow, or journalist-level oversimplification.  But there's lots of room in between.

Could we *please* stop equivocating on the term "backed by"?  It means something *completely* different in the case of "backed by gold" vs "backed by a military".  The former means "redeemable on demand for a fixed quantity of gold" (which the USD is not anymore), and the latter means "value is generally promoted due to enforcement powers possessed by the military".
They're good points to make, but it doesn't help when you silently switch the meaning of a term between uses.
In other words,
**WRONG:**  
A: The US dollar isn't backed by anything.  
B: Nuh uh, it's backed by the military/ the full faith and credit of the USG / the US economy / [other vacuous expressions].
**RIGHT:**  
A: The US dollar isn't redeemable for a fixed quantity of gold.  
B: But the US government's taxes must be paid in dollars, and the enforcement of this taxation gives it value.
This has been a public service announcement which will make no difference.
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:25:37
Yes, layering on any service will increase the cost.  The difference is that Bitcoin decouples the "running a financial network" role from "being a trusted party" role.  As it stands now, you have to run a big clearinghouse (as the CC companies or paypal do) in order provide this service, but with BTC, anyone that both parties trust can rule on whether to issue a chargeback.  The lower barriers to entry suggest thinner profit margins ("oligopoly rents").

@_date: 2013-04-04 17:27:11


What?  How is that any protection?  If there's a feasible way to ~~get the private key from the public~~ generate valid signatures given only the (hash of the) public key, then you can make trades with that address's balance, *regardless* of how seldom it's used.
It's like this:
1) Address gets transfer of bitcoins (this is public knowledge)  
2) ECDSA being broken, you quickly figure out ~~that address's private key~~ how to validly sign for that address  
3) You sign the transfer of those bitcoins to an address of your choice.  
4) Profit!   (Modulo the fact that everyone else can do the same to you.)
So yeah, it seems like this would be fatal, regardless of your protocol hygiene.
It seems the only protection would be to spend whatever you get ASAP, and hope your signing of that spend gets incorporated into the blockchain before the attacker's transfer -- basically, a major game of hot potato.
Edit: Clarify the kind of crypto break required.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:41:10
Bitcoin hedgers unaffected.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:23:12


Okay, right, in the comment I replied to you were talking about public keys, not addresses.  My point was about addresses though.


The cryptographic literature generally classifies the kinds of breaks of a system, and one break is the case where the attacker finds an algorithm that gets the right results without knowing specifically knowing the key (public or private).  It's a common enough possibility that there's a category.  (Do you want the specific citation to Schneier, or is that believable enough?)
So yes, a lot of people are mystified about how you can reverse engineer a cryptosystem without finding the specific algorithm the victim is using, and when they do happen, they're not obvious.  So I can't be expected to even say what the attack would look like, as it would involve some subtlety in the math that relates the signature to the hash.
However, the fact that the verifier *doesn't even need* the public key to verify a signature, and in fact uses the hash as an input to the verification process, should suggest that an attack, should one be found, would involve finding an alternate way to go from address (plus message) to signature directly, not necessarily by solving the two subproblems you suggest are the only way.

More generally, people seem to think that the size of a bitcoin is in any way not arbitrary.
They will think it's "amazing" when "a single bitcoin is worth $2000", even though you could have said the same thing if the market cap were 1/10 the size and the network were set to have ~~10x~~ 1/10th as many bitcoins.

No, not really.  In the "lost in the forest case", you weren't deliberately forgoing consumption by spending the coins -- you never had the option to redeem the coins for goods, because you didn't have them.  In the "hiding under bed" case, however, you did.
Thus, in the latter case, the economy got the correct signal about much demand (derived from previous production) existed.  In the former case, there could have been thousands of goods produced based on realistic assumptions and which the (would-be) hoarder wanted, but he was unable to signal, from his previous production, that he wanted them, because his earnings were gone.
Hoarding gives a correct signal (output sucks/there's too much uncertainty to draw down savings), while losing money distorts the records of intermediate exchange.  Huge difference.

I had a [decent rig for the time]( running in 2011.  I wish I hadn't mothballed it when I did (sometime in August).  It was mainly because it had insane cooling costs in the Texas weather and moved into a hotel in anticipation of job-switching soon where (I thought) it would get undesirable attention and not be worth the risk.
My parents wouldn't let me run it at their place because of the danger of a 500 mL coolant spill, nor would my brother.  Ho hum.  Well, at least I built up a pretty big cache.
During the rig's setup process, I also destroyed ~2 BTC when I wiped a harddrive to reinstall the OS before I transferred the mined coins to an address with a wallet saved somewhere.  There wasn't much reason to be cautious at the time: "meh, only 2 bitcoins ... maybe $3".

That wasn't a pure positive.

Related question: I haven't cashed out yet, but how does it work to deduct mining costs from previous years. I should be able to deduct the cost of the mining rig from any income I've made from selling the coins, surely.
So regardless of exactly *how* you quantify the expenses vs income, when should I report (or should I have reported) the purchase on my taxes?  If I sell $5000 of bitcoins today, report it on my taxes, and then deduct $2000 from it "for that mining rig I bought two years ago", would I be penalized for not having reported the expense back then?

What do you mean by a rogue miner?  Their contribution of computations to the network *is* their certification.  Anyone who so contributes (by, in essence, guessing partial pre-images of hash targets) will temporarily increase the rate at which bitcoins are mined (via solving blocks), thereby increasing the difficulty factor and thus the difficulty of interfering with the network.
(Edit: In fact, the whole *design* of bitcoin is based around the idea of non-discrimination between hash computations ["hash neutrality"?].  That is, it throws away, from the outset, any system of rejecting contributions by source, even double-spends.  Rather than blacklist their source, it simply has a [protocol]( for identifying which of those spends is the valid one, and that protocol is based on identifying which ledger has the majority of the work invested in it, which is a way of handling the [Byzantine Generals' Problem]( that Bitcoin must solve in order to work.)
The only "rogue" action here would be if someone were able to swamp the network with a higher hashrate than the rest of it (i.e. the 50% attacks you hear discussed).  But you need to be a little more dedicated than a "rogue" to pull that off at this point ...

This is a great intro, but it doesn't cover the mining aspect and why it's important that so much computation (from the rewarded miners) be invested in each ledger update.  (It's to have a focal point that everyone agrees on, and is too expensive to replace with a different one.)
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:06:47
Edit: Sorry, skimmed over the bit about how you're the author.  Thanks for the reply, and the article -- it's definitely one of the better bitcoin demystification articles I've seen, and I only focused on the shortcomings rather than what you did will.  FWIW, you did a good job on the parts you talked about.
The layman's explanation for all of those would be:
- The network picks the ledger that a) has a valid hash solution, b) has only valid transactions (signed, not over-spending transaction), and c) has the most work put into it.
- A valid solution is a number that obeys a certain mathematical relation with the transactions listed in the ledger update.
- A valid solution is hard to find because you can't do much better than randomly guessing -- hashes are one-way functions which means it's easy to calculate them, but hard to invert them (find a number that would hash to given output).
- Since you can't do better then guessing, the fact that you found a solution means you guessed at least certain number of times (and did the corresponding calculation work).  If you're guessing a random number from 1 to 1000, then the fact that you guessed right means that, on average, you must have guessed 500 times.

They don't get a signal for that car *specifically* (which the hoarder isn't signaling for anyway; he prefers the option value of holding the money uncommitted or he'd make a deal immediately for purchase in two years).  Rather, they get a signal in the form of increasing value of money and decreasing value of limited-use goods.  That signals the market to invest in goods that useful across a broad range of scenarios rather than narrowly useful (but highly specialized) goods.
In the case of hoarding, that signal is real, moving production in the right direction.  In the case of lost money, it's a false signal, moving production in the wrong direction.  That's the difference.

Not an expert, but my understanding is that messages are just broadcast by "shouting"; you just send a lot of them, everywhere. It doesn't matter if one gets lost, so long as they reach the other parties eventually. And it doesn't matter if someone gets the same message twice.

@_date: 2013-07-24 16:31:41


I'm not talking about the moral sense, though: just in terms of efficiency.  If you accept that theft isn't simply a reshuffling of existing wealth but reduces total wealth production, then you understand the kind of value-free "bad" that I mean here.
In that sense, both theft and loss send a false (bad) signal, and this is *compounded* by the market's inability to recognize and correct for it.


Also why you shouldn't be so insistent that all money be either spent or invested in at any given time -- some ventures really shouldn't be, an any dependence on that just creates the conditions for bubbles.  If you force out the option to hoard, and force people to invest in specific ventures (or even the economy as a whole) to retain the value of their savings, then you shouldn't be surprised when (physical) capital and labor are locked up in dying ventures longer than they should be.


And once you accept that there are situations where hoarding isn't pure waste, you need to specify criteria for determining when it will be.  So what are your criteria?

Then wouldn't the very best currency be the one in which you can never hold on to money but must immediately spend it?  And therefore you must decide how you're going to spend each dollar before you receive it?
That would imply that the best currency is barter, which (by construction) has *zero* lag between receipt of a medium of exchange and its expenditure, because there is none.  Which means you made a mistake somewhere.


If everyone saved, they're doing it for a reason.  Forcing them not to save doesn't help "the economy" in the sense people actually care about (i.e. maximizing overall utility) unless you tautologically define a "good economy" as when "people trade as much as possible".
There are more things in heaven and earth than maximizing the number of exchanges.

To follow up on my [comment above]( and because I think danielravennest conflates the transaction crypto with mining, let me try another way of putting it.
There are two problems that must be solved for Bitcoin to work:
1) Proving that the owner of bitcoins really authorized the transfer.  This is handled with standard crypto, specifically digital signatures.
2) Proving that everyone is using the *same* latest ledger.  (A subproblem of this is preventing double spends, because if different parts of the network use different ledgers, they might both have proof that a user authorized the transfer of all their bitcoins to 2 different people.)
The Bitcoin protocol says "Here's how you're going to decide which ledger version to use: it's the one that has the most work invested in it."  If everyone follows the protocol then, they can expect everyone else to be (within a few minutes) looking at the same ledger version that they are, because they all switch to it as soon as they hear news of it.  So even if someone double-spends their coins, people will only accept the validity of the one spend that appears on the ledger version that has the most work invest in it.
A **ledger version** is more commonly referred to as a **block**.
The definition of "amount of work" includes all of the work on the block that it is updating from (i.e. the previous block).  So, naturally, if want to submit an update, you will want to update from the latest block because you get all of its work counted in yours.  Hence the term **block chain** -- there is a series of ledger updates, all updating from the previous block/ledger update.
I'm a bit busy, but I'll continue the explanation later to cover why those who are proving they invested work (i.e. miners) submit updates and how they prove it.

For your second paragraph, I'm finding it helps to use a sports analogy, because it answers a lot of the typical questions in an accessible manner.  (I'm going to use basketball, adapt as suited.)
(The non crypto aspect of) Bitcoin is like a million-team game of basketball, with spendable points.  This lets you answer the common questions:
"Where do the coins come from?" -&gt; The same place that basketball points come from: the watchers' collective recognition that each team has a certain number of points.
"Why can't people just make copies of their money to get more?" -&gt; For the same reason that you can't copy points in basketball: everyone else knows the rules and you have to alter their records too.
"What if people don't follow the rules?" -&gt; Same thing as in basketball: the other players ignore and exclude them.
"How does mining get you anything?" -&gt; Because one of the rules is that you "score points" for yourself if you're the first to find a solution for the current block (ledger update).

Two things together
1) Really good hardware and software capable of de-anonymizing the network by identifying the graph structure of payments between addresses, and then gradually unveiling who is who by starting from known (name &lt;-&gt; address) associations.  (Some of which would be announced public in public anyway some of which would be given to you by the merchants you deal with.)
2) Banning "mixing services" (which are very, very similar to money laundering and thus in a much weaker legal position, esp cross-border), which make the problem in 1) much harder.  These services are the weak point because internet traffic can tell you their hubs of operation, which would in turn be easier targets to go after.
Together, the above effects could remove enough of the anonymity, or threaten it enough,  to kill the network effects leading people to trust in its future value.
Solution: ultra-decentralized mixers that somehow solve the problems of a) people keeping bitcoins they were supposed to pass on, and b) not overloading the block chain with ledgers to the point where it's impractical to run a node for any but a few big players.

Whoa whoa whoa, you think that hoarders are necessarily hurting utility maximization, but you're claiming *I'm* being ideological?  No, until you recognize what benefits hoarding has, you can't possibly have a model that weighs its benefits against the delayed recovery.  If we just shuffle everybody into *new* unsustainable lines of production (like the people selling mortgage related products), it will simply mean a worse problem down the line, even though it artificially gooses the numbers for a while.
No, not every trade should happen, and yes, sometimes waiting for better opportunities to arise is good, even in the aggregate.  You can't simply force as many trades to happen as possible and call it improvement.

How long may one hold on to their currency before it counts as "hoarding" and is therefore bad"?  If you can't answer that, you have no basis for arguing for a policy that reduces it, as that would imply that you think no dollar should ever linger in anyone's pocket.

Second, the reason people are asking why you aren't buying them is *itself* a disproof of your claim: it bitcoin reliably gained value like you claimed, you could just buy it now and reap the profits.  It's never occurred to you that any such easy gains are already priced in.

(Incidentally, I remember someone a while back asking why mining pools don't give a disproportionate reward to the miner that found the solution.  I was going to mock it by acting like finding the solution somehow required you to be more insightful rather than just being lucky, and wrote up this whole puff piece about some "hand-miner" getting a bit mathematical insight on how to invert hashes -- as if a lone dude could do that! -- and then somehow finding the solution without just guessing.)

Right ... Just like how the market can't "see" whether an increase in a thief's purchasing power is from the thief suddenly becoming more productive vs. the thief falsifying ownership records of the money.
Nevertheless, we can understand why theft is -- in the appropriate rigorous sense -- bad, while becoming more productive is good, even if the market can't, purely through price signals, distinguish them.


That assumes the neighbor engaging in a sustainable mode of production.  What if they're not?  Or more generally, what if neighbors on average are not?  Then investment in them would make no sense and I'd just be compounding the waste.
The whole "hoarding is pure waste" mentality always carries the implicit assumption that investment is, on average, going to be welfare-enhancing.  If only!  Manias can make it so that investment is (again, on average) not productive, and hoarding is vital to cut off the damage, so long as the benefits to hoarding aren't simply inflated away.

That's why I edited my post: an ECDSA break can mean multiple things.  It can mean "you can infer private key from public" -- which, you're right, only reduces it to a hash preimage problem, which is still hard.
Another level of break would be "you can generate valid signatures given only the hash of the public key aka bitcoin address".  One *way* to accomplish that would be hash inversion + private key from public, but there are potentially other ways.

How do mining pools check the honesty of participants?
The mining pool server basically divides up the work and hands it off to members of the pool to hash and look for a nonce solution, right?  So what's to stop a dishonest client from falsely claiming to have checked a bunch of nonces -- finding no solution of course -- when really they did nothing?
I'm guessing the answer has something to do with how the miners have to send a Merkle tree of the hashes they computed, which can be audited at random, but I was hoping someone had a better (correct) explanation.

How do you plan to get cash to your friend 5000 miles away?


Kinda like how no one's going to carry $3000 in their pockets to buy a refrigerator?
Oh, what's that?  You mean it's possible to layer a protocol on top of physical cash to make it more convenient and safe?  Well, you can do that with Bitcoin too.
By the way, go look up the figure "time until transfer is fully complete (i.e. no longer reversible)" for credit cards, checks, cashier's checks, money orders, and wire transfers.  You agree that for Bitcoin, this value is about one hour.  Now, go look up the corresponding figure for the other cash-substitutes I listed.  (Hint: it's a lot more than one hour.)
And while you're at it, look up the expression "apples to apples" -- great analysis heuristic, I think.

It may be standard procedure to provide evidence you could have legally obtained the bond money (though even on that I'm iffy), but I don't see why they would need to learn about the bitcoins.  If he has independent evidence of "legit" earnings in US dollars (which it looks like the defense argued), then it's irrelevant what *specific* exchange he made to enable the bond posting.
That would be like demanding an independent proprietor prove that his wacky invention (that he sells for money) is actually useful in order to post bond.
I don't even see why the court even has to know about the bitcoins -- apparently, the OP could have just said "I have this job/income", which is sufficient to prove he didn't need to do anything illegal to post the bond.
If the story is true at all, I think the OP was just unnecessarily injecting a reference to bitcoin in the hopes that the government would "bite" and challenge bitcoin, giving him a chance to defend it.  If that's what he was going for ... hey, whatever floats your boat.
