You are right, they use bitcoins code, but the code is open source so anyone can grab it create their own, but that doesnt mean it has value. It would be like someone standing with a burger shop right outside of McDonalds claiming to be selling a big mac, but its not the original for a reason. What makes bitcoin decentralized is the participants in the network that help secure and decentralize it, otherwise known as nodes. Anyone can have a node, just download the bitcoin and blockchain protocol on their computer, and become an active participant in the network and helping to make it more secure and decentralized. Bitcoins network has grown organically like this for 10 years of people opening up nodes to help secure and decentralize, none of the other alt coins have this amount of node participation in the network, which is why, like I said before, bitcoin is the only truly and tested decentralized cryptocurrency because of all tens of thousands of participating nodes. All the other alt coins just copied bitcoins code, and claim to be bigger and better than bitcoin but when you truly look at them, they do not have the rock solid fundamentals that bitcoin has and has developed over those 10 years. These solid fundamentals translate directly to the ability to be able to trust the network and money system because all money is based on trust. At the end of the day the best money is the one you can trust the most to hold value and be secure for the future, and bitcoin had proven itself over and over to be this. The alts are just jockeying for any position of use case in the future. Most likely in my view, bitcoin doesnt need to scale because it already does what it does beautifully as a rocl solid store of value and a new global reserve money. If you look at some of the originals like satoshi and halo Finney, they thought bitcoin would act as the worldwide store of value, and some other currencies would fill the medium of exchange and unit of account. I see litecoin and maybe a few other filling this role. All the other alts will die over time. 
Cryptography is merely a way to code the transfer of value by so it cannot be clearly seen who is sending the transaction and who is receiving it, thus potentially being able to stop the transaction or put due coercion to stop people from using the network because you can quickly identify them. Its kind of a part of the partial annomynoty of bitcoin. It's  it's own separate part of bitcoin that collectively with decentralization, security and limited supply that give bitcoin real value over all the others.

Great I'm glad I could help clarify it for you. Yes, the real value in bitcoin is the fact that it literally cant be shut down because if its decentralization which is why its unstoppable. All the other alts have points if failure the governments could pinpoint and destroy with regulations, etc. Think about the fact that China has already thrown in the towel against and accepted that they cant stop it and is even declaring it legal and the US has declared it's not regulatable because it wasnt created the same way and they are slowly coming to the grips they cant stop it either. Thays why bitcoin is special and king. It also allows for all the other alts to flourish. I can pretty much guarantee if it weren't for the unstoppable nature of bitcoin bitcoin leading the way, governments around the world would have attacked and stopped crypto because it's a threat to their power structure and control of money. 
 You are also right, bitcoin is not really anonymous, its partially anonymous.  I'm hoping in the future they will implement more privacy features (lightning network is one avenue) but if not, like I said, some alts that survive will have their niche area (one being privacy coin) if bitcoin doesn't become a medium of exchange and unit of account because it isn't fast enough.
@_date: 2019-07-28 13:06:21
No it is the most secure because it is the most decentralized. This decentralization is what prevents anyone from truly controlling the entire network.  All other crypto besides bitcoin are not decentralized, the only one even kind is close is litecoin. Decentralization is THE most important property of the many that bitcoin possesses and is what truly sets it apart. Without decentralization we just have fiat currencies styled "cryptocurrencies" because the supply of coins and network can be manipulated.

I think you fail to fully understand why bitcoin has taken over. It took me a while of dabbling in the alts before coming back to bitcoin. All of the other coins can be attacked and shut down or have their supply manipulated from the internal teams that created them. They may also have super fast transaction speeds but the network security is nowhere in the same universe as the hash power that goes into bitcoin. Thus all of these alts cannot be trusted because someone (or a small group) somewhere has the ability to change the network against the communities wishes. The reason bitcoin is the best is because it's the ONLY truly tested and decentralized coin which is why its king. It proved that when it shook off the attempted corporate takeover with the big blocks in 2017. Unless one of these coins magically solves the scale-secure-decentralized trilemma, bitcoin will continue to be king because decentralization and security are the most crucial for a store of value.

We need to respect this generations interest in :
1. Personal financial freedom from corrupt banks and the banking system 
2. Increased liberty through immutability and decentralization
3. Freedom to choose ones own money instead of being forced to use the money of your country origin
4. Wealth generation from an arguably risky investment into a potentially world changing technology
I think it would be naive for anyone to say they wouldn't like to become rich from investing into bitcoin or other crypto, but with bitcoin being close to 10K for one coin, an individual in this generation would need hundreds of thousands of dollars at their disposal to buy enough bitcoin \(and hope it appreciates in value\) and make themselves rich quick. There are many legitimate reasons this generation is interested in bitcoin and to claim the only reason is that  its just to "get rich quick" is myopic and disingenuous.

Thanks for all the replys guys! This is really helping me understand everything a lot better! I have some follow up questions:
I downloaded the bitcoin core zip file from here: [
From what I read from you guys post, I can use a lightweight wallet on my phone to connect to my node at home to verify all transactions are valid. However, is there a list anywhere as to which lightweight wallets work with this BITCOIN Core node wallet? Is there a write up anywhere on how to do this as I am still relatively a newb at running a node and the inner workings. 
Also, Is it useful or suggested to use a VPN or TOR along side running the NODE? My thought here is to mask the IP address so as to node be able to see I'm running node. If it is something worth while for privacy, is there also any write up or link to how to do this as well? Would I simply just start the TOR or VPN and then start running the node after I have connected to one of them?

Good stuff, thanks for posting. I really like your opinion on how you explained that bitcoin doesn't need and perhaps shouldn't be intrinsically valuable.  I think you are correct as well as this is one of the most annoying points that people who chastise bitcoin always mention. Even though they will also agree that the dollar and other fiat money has no intrinsic value either.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:57:20
You're view of people that HOLD as being paranoid doesnt exactly hold water as well as your view that people only get into crypto to "get rich quick". Blanket generalizations about why people do things usually aren't very scientifically accurate. There are many reasons people get into crypto, some of these might be: 
1. Personal financial freedom from corrupt banks and the banking system
2. Increased liberty through immutability and decentralization
3. Freedom to choose ones own money instead of being forced to use the money of your country origin
4. Wealth generation from an arguably risky investment into a potentially world changing technology \("Get rich quick"\)
I think it would be naive for anyone to say they wouldn't like to become  rich from investing into bitcoin or other crypto. However with bitcoin being  close to 10K for one coin, an individual in this generation would need  hundreds of thousands of dollars at their disposal to buy enough bitcoin  \(and hope it appreciates in value\) and make themselves rich quick.  There are many legitimate reasons why people are interested in  bitcoin/crypto and to claim the only reason is that  its just to "get rich  quick" is myopic and disingenuous. It also shows your lack of knowledge about the technology and its possibilities to change our world. I suggest you educate yourself on the technology and then come back to present a decent argument as to why that technology will not succeed and THAT is why you "got out at the right time" instead of calling people who use and value the tech as  "Paranoid" and single minded.

Great article but I think national cryptos can just be added to the list of other shit coins that people won't want. People in Venezuela are already proving they dont want it and would prefer bitcoin or other crypto for transactions.  We already primarily use national digital currencies, adding "Crypto" to it doesn't give it anymore value, its just changes the name of something that is still a centralized, highly controlled and monitored currency.  By the time governments start making their own currencies, bitcoin and the other legit alt coins will have taken hold, there will be no demand for national crypto and no one will want or need use it. I believe people will always gravitate towards permission less, open technologies like bitcoin, and other REAL cryptocurrencies. The only way I can see national crypto taking hold is if your government mandates that you MUST use national crypto otherwise face legal action, however in that case, your country has made it fairly clear they don't value individual freedom.

Congrats! I just recently setup my own bitcoin node and I am also looking to setup a LND node also! Although I found it isn't as clear cut as to how to run a LND node as it its a Core node, how did you go about it? Any suggestions or links to good info?

Nice bitcoin fear porn. Its pretty convincing until I read this statement: 
"There is no inflation, and therefore no incentive to invest". 
The future traveler must have been a Keynesian economist. Apparently if your money is sound and doesnt lose value over time, that means you have no need to invest in trying to accumulate more. 
Investments are always incentivized but they depend on the type of money used. With sound money you are incentivized to invest in solid, less risky products/services because of the fear of losing that sounds money invested as well as building Capitol from the saved wealth. With unsound money you are incentivized to make risky investments to make back the value lost from the inflation of the currency. 
Sound money historically builds empires and golden ages. Perhaps this time travellers should travel back in time and read the bitcoin standard so they can understand how money works.

Great article. Been waiting for years for fiat and all the ills it produces to die much deserved death. I guess if people stay ignorant to the giant global ponzie scheme they the bankers are running, It will be around for a while longer. Unfortunately as long as people allow this they will be able to manipulate everything including  bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:11:11
Its funny that people who dont understand bitcoin initially call it a ponzi scheme when it is literally the opposite and was designed as such. In reality, our current fiancial system is the ponzu scheme because a small group of unelected, unaccountable people control the flow of dollars (or whatever other fiat) to the world and have carte blanche to print as much as they want to enrich themselves and their friends at the expense of everyone else.
Bitcoin is different because there Is no one who can print more for their own benefit. These rich people (and anyone else who understands money and can see what is coming), if they are smart enough, will latch onto bitcoin and hold it for as long as possible. They will have to really make responsible decisions as to how to hold and spend their bitcoin because if they sceew up and spend it on something dumb or an unwise investemt,  they cant get someone to just print more and give it to them at 0 percent interest like the banks do now. Currently money is cheap, easy and disposable to the people in power who control it and it gives them immense power. The simple fact that bitcoin cannot be printed at whim like money can now completely changes the paradigm.

No they just devalue it by 40% by printing more and giving it to the corrupt bankers who created the mess in 2008. Or they do ACTUALLY steal it from your bank account to like they did in Greece. Basically the same thing. Banks own your money, you don't.

I believe he meant fall 30% in value, not dollars literally disappearing, Your comparison is misleading. Dollars are also a commodity tied to oil on top of being a currency that can absolutely lose value. Our or any currency can easily lose 30% of its value quickly if other countries stop using the currency or lose faith from inflation, an other reasons thus dropping the demand and the value with it. 
You might as well say "Ask the Venezuelan how many kilograms of their worthless money they need for basic supplies if you think a currency cant lose 30% let alone 1500% a day". I suggest you learn about basic supply and demand and inflation.
