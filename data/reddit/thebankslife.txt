You sure can, actually only accepting BTC at the moment.

Yeah we can do bulk discounts. PM me with the amount you had in mind.
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:36:38
No problem, I understand. Of course I accept BTC!

My apologies, should have added International Shipping Rate.
Shipping Internationally + $2.50 (per 20 stickers)
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:36:31
Way more expensive.

At the moment currently not offering that. Unless you were interested in purchasing several hundred / thousand. I'd have to order the media. I can print on it, just don't have it stocked.
@_date: 2016-06-25 02:12:44
I'll be printing stickers of these if anyone is interested!

For vehicles? These are technically decals / stickers. You can put remove/re-apply them.

Currently in the process of setting up a small shop, however in the mean time I can 'manually' handle orders.
How many and what design were you looking for? The pricing would depend on quantity and size obviously.

Setup a small shop, not on OpenBazaar.
