Hey, I am actually happy to hear that. I am just trying to get my facts straight. I understand the python has the ability to touch files and that can cause some security threats. But, if none of that is allowed (basically never import os), then is it not safe? I understand for this to be the case, I need to setup some PGP keys for it so people can verify they are downloading the correct application. I understand right now that an application like this is more inconvenient that is convenient. since things like [ and [  already exist that you can download and run from a computer that will never touch the internet. But I would like an application to do all of this. 
But you did mention how you did not like python, would c++ be better?

Right, but once the application touches the internet, it is no better than Electrum. In fact it would be so much worse than Electrum because Electrum is backed by a bunch of smart dudes. I am just some way who rigged together an application. I want to avoid having this touching the internet by any means necessary. But once I do that, a html file serves the same propose. Unfortunate, I still learned a lot about how addresses are generated, which is pretty cool. But, I agree, there is no need for an app like this.

I like the idea of an Electrum light program, but I believe I what I am trying to create serves a slightly different propose. All I want is an application that does nothing but generate private keys and public addresses that can be used as a paper wallet. My thought process is that hardware wallets are easy to use and secure, what if we could make paper wallets easy to use? Even though I am having a hard time finding a real reason to create an app like this, I think I am going to keep working on it and see where it goes.
