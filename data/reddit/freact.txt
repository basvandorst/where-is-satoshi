"11 herbs and spices"
You can remember this because their Twitter account follows only the spice girls and 5 dudes named herb

That wasn't actually a question... asking for a friend.

I think his sentence was better the way it was. Corporate cronies are just a consequence of government. Government is the problem.

I like people's comments about the free market here, the only thing I would add (as a devils advocate) is that I think ridiculous price discrepancies like this could give a bad image to bitcoin. I think applications like this are targeted at people who are new and unsure about bitcoin and it might not be our best representative.

I breathed some air out of my nose pretty quickly

Intellectual property only exists because the government made it law. They can make laws against Bitcoin just as easily. They will claim it's stealing. How they justify it and if/why people will believe it, Idk. It's exactly the same as torrents on the legality front though.

Lol, arbitrage. Yeah go for it :P

My thoughts exactly

I know it won't make a difference saying it, but its absolutely ludicrous that you try to regulate our decentralized currency. As said below, you are pathetic. You're dead in the water and you don't even know it.
@_date: 2014-07-18 05:02:58
I'm sure they do make sense to the legal system, but the legal system doesn't care about 'cents'. All they care about is dollars.

Click bait title much?

Okay, I'm thinking classic cheesy infomercial style. We see some comically evil banksters printing off stacks of money and diving into pools of money like Scrooge Mcduck. Then maybe pan to some hardworking regular Joes looking all depressed about their depreciating money. In comes over excited tech guy to send them all some Bitcoin. They all rejoice and the bad guy is just like "and I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling kids". Zoom in on happy faces of Bitcoin users.

Can you do a look like [this]( If so you're hired.

We ought to be glad they don't use GPG or we wouldn't know the half of their corruption.

I feel like their username contains some choice words for Lawsky

If you're so confident of his impeachment maybe you should put your money where your mouth is.
[Trump to be successfully impeached before end of 2017.]( You can currently buy shares at 2.99 mBit. Payout is 10 mBit. Pretty nice odds for you there ;)
I for one, would be happy to take your money.

That's a different chart.

I'd be careful with comments like this. D - O - X - I - N - G is a ban-able offense.
@_date: 2017-02-10 05:58:46
Wait... wtf is this:
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:19:41
There are already two great replies to this comment, but I really just wanted to point out that: You (nor anyone) has literally any idea what would be possible with more competition in the fields you mention or many others.
I hate to be that guy that turns the conversation political, but I think a realization like this is what leads some people towards Libertarianism.

Guess he didn't want his reddit account to be associated with that bitcoin wallet?

If someone was actively stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from you and your legal system offered no help or possible recourse I wonder what would you do? How far might you go? 
Contractual obligations have no meaning unless they are backed by some show of force against aggressors.

I value people based in how frequently they say masturbatory.

Price is so low we're reaching dogecoin levels of meme.
