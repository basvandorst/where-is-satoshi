well you don't give any facts contradicting what I said. This is just an opinion and I would never make a financial choice over an opinion

what are good alt coins in your opinion? I really like funfair since it is backed by company who has a chance to actually make a profit so rise in value. How do you think about it?

Can I get the link to your website?
@_date: 2018-10-18 09:40:01
Do you have it in higher resolution?

well either way is always a gamble. I made money so I am happy. Also what you explain sounds a lot like: Buy high, sell low. Also everyone who ends a comment with "pro trader here" sounds like a 25 year old virgin living in his mothers basement. So if you want people to take you seriously don't end a comment like that.
