I just downloaded a lightning wallet (BlueWallet) for the first time to withdraw a couple tips I got on here. Is there a way to transfer that to my regular wallet (Electrum)?

How much is .05 and .1 BTC to y’all? Is a desktop wallet ok for these amounts or would it warrant a hardware wallet

From what I understand institutions will be able to buy BTC as a commodity now via contracts? Idk I’m still trying to figure it out as well

I had bought $150 originally to buy drugs, but then I started reading about BTC and ended up holding onto it. I wish I had bought more ☹️☹️
