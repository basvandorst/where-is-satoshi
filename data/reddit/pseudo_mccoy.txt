You hate bankers but love the banks? Tim wants the blockchain to rely on legal institutions and the banks they serve.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:16:20
That's not answering my question. That's a redirection much like Tim's definition of the blockchain.

Yes, but since when do I need a tinfoil hat to use a decentralized currency in a decentralized way?
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:47:37


Fair enough. Not trying to put words in your mouth. I understand we're talking about different use cases now but don't get the point of replicating ledgers in this way.

Maybe the "average person" should consider nutting up and securing his or her own private keys.

He calls the blockchain a distributed ledger that's reliant on legal institutions. This isn't the blockchain I know or want. If I wanted another system that's reliant on legal institutions I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, what's the point?

I shouldn't have to be what? Using bitcoin the way it was designed?

And a 20% discount? Nice. Good to know both companies are interested.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:11:23
You don't own bitcoin if you don't control the private keys.
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:58:25
Oh, right. Sry I read that wrong.
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:23:20
Thanks for explaining. I see these blockchains are separate now. I don't care about fintech.

It doesn't have to make sense for them to ban it.
Never underestimate hubris.

In a previous, related thread it was decided best to change "warm satoshis" to something less obscure.

Chump change.

A couple years ago I had a drone and was offered a job by a realtor buddy to do flyovers on property. A major reason I declined to invest in this was regulation.

Disruptive tech meets cannabis distribution. Who'd have both the resources and motive to attack this? Civil ~~asset~~ drone forfeiture may someday kill two birds with one stone... or spoofed signal.

1) Shoot firearm into the sky within city limits.
2) Get arrested.
3) Profit?

That's awesome. Feels like the US is making commercial use cost prohibitive to all but law enforcement and Hollywood.
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:37:29


TIL by the time drones go mainstream the US government will already have over a decade of experience shooting them down.
I'd like to see the exercises too, but am probably unable to get clearance. If only I could somehow remotely pilot a camera overhead...
