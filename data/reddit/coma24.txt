I do love BTC as the pioneer cryptocurrency, but as a solution that scales in its present form, not so much. LN is a complex 2nd layer solution that feels to me like it wouldn't be necessary (at least not for a very long time) if we simply went to 8MB blocks (that's an 8x increase in transaction throughput), reduce the block time to 60 secs (that's another 10x increase in throughput) and continue with segwit (8x increase in number of transactions per block or more, at least from my recollection).
That's...640x more transactions per second than can be handled now. The mempool would be vanquished in no time flat, fees would drop (and rightfully so) and the currency would become a whole lot more useful than it is right now.
Yes, other currencies work really well because they're not being pushed as hard, but really, you could scale the bejeus out of BTC by just doing 2 out of the above 3 things. I really wish I understood why the increased block size, and/or a reduction in block time was such a controversy early on. As an outsider, it seems like a huge cluster from a public perception standpoint to have all these derivatives of BTC.
BTC had a massive moment in the spotlight in Nov/Dec and it didn't come out looking particularly good. It could've seen way more mainstream adoption, but now it feels so heavy compared to other, more agile systems.
Can someone take a moment to explain to me why increased block size and reduced transaction size would've been a big problem?

I want to make sure you understand. If you have 2 pizzas that are 16" in diameter, and you cut one pizza into 4 pieces (blocks) and the other into 40 pieces, it's still the same amount of pizza in total (ie. space taken up by these blocks)
Now, if you said that you can churn out just ONE SLICE every 10 minutes....you're going to get through 10x MORE pizza (transactions) by using the bigger slices.
Remember, the throughput is not limited based on the size of the slice...you're simply limited to 1 slice every 10 mins. 
If you need to feed an INCREASING number of people...and your machine only churns out ONE slice every 10 mins...that had better be a mighty slice or your system doesn't scale.
A system that is ARTIFICIALLY and ARBITRARILY limited in its scale is not "a good thing because it shows increased demand for space." It's bad because it can't handle what is actually some pretty pitiful volume in the scheme of things.
This would be like telling Ebay, "you guys are so dumb for adding all those web servers behind your load balancer. Your system would be worth so much more if you only allowed 4 auctions to happen at any given time."  No....no, it wouldn't.
The current configuration of BTC was fantastic for a small community to tinker with it...it was absolutely not ready for anything even approaching prime time use. 4-6 transactions per second as a global cap....are you absolutely serious? Are people supposed to feel GOOD that they are number 228,000 in the queue, and that the queue is growing slightly faster than it's shrinking (meaning there is no catch up taking place), AND that people can jump ahead by paying more...but even more good news, if everyone pays more (which is exactly what's happening), nothing changes, other than pools/miners collecting more fees?

Every transaction takes up a certain amount of space. Transactions are grouped into blocks. Blocks are created every 10 minutes. The number of transactions in the block (hence, the effective transaction rate of the system) is limited by the the maximum size of the block.
The bigger the block size, the more transactions you can cram into a block.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:22
Explain how an increase in block size increases the overall blockchain size. 
If you have 1,000,000 transactions in the chain, the blocksize effects how many blocks it takes to represent those transactions. In fact, the overall chain size is made slightly larger by having a small block size because there is some space required per block (independent of the transactions). 
Separately, what has that got to do with the number of nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:43

I agree with a lot of your post, but I hear some chest thumping about BCH not being battled-tested. What am I missing? BTC is being battled tested right now and it is an absolute slaughter. Don't get me wrong, as a dev, I love the elegance of blockchain, the nodes and the mining pools. However, I just don't get how a few arbitrary decisions (10 min block time and fixed block size) have been allowed to hamper the coin's success.
I'm pretty new to the space, so I don't know what the dev climate was like during inception and the early days, but the 4-6 transaction per second limit should've been a HUGE red flag a long, long time ago and it should never have been able to exist this long with this limitation.
The flagship cryptocurrency has this crazy transaction limit and just when it gets the spotlight that everyone had to know was coming....it falls over in the worst possible way...to an issue that was 100% known ahead of time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:35:39
I also work in tech as a dev and founder. You're confusing block size with overall length of the blockchain. Increasing or decreasing the size of individual blocks affects how many transactions will be in the block. Since blocks are only produced every 10 mins...the only way to increase throughput in the current system is to increase block size (and as a result, the number of transactions in a block).
The overall size will be what it will be, that is unavoidable. Why are you complaining about how badly the tech works on a 10+ yr old computer?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:30
the number of unconf tx are sitting at around 285K at time of writing. With so many users in the space, coupled with a lot of shifting of coins taking place, I am struggling to understand how the size of the mempool is going to come down (other than TX timeouts, but those, presumably, will just result in resends at higher TX fees in most cases).
Is LN the answer? I still don't know much about it...but I'm going to look at it really closely to find out. I know shorter block times and larger blocks would certainly help alleviate the short to medium term pain, too, but that's not happening without (another) hard fork, right?
It seems like much of the panic that's taking place is based on huge transaction fees (justified, 2017-01-01 block fee was 0.8BTC, today it's around 10 BTC and the sluggish clearing of the pool. How is this a surprise when the system is fundamentally limited to 4-6 transactions per second? 
Lastly, I hope that dev decisions aren't being made based on keeping the fees high for miners. The effective base transaction fees are too high at this point to be sustainable. There's no earthly reason the fees per block should be as high as the mining reward at this early stage of the game. Edit: and yes, I do mine, too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:30:33
I misunderstood your point. Yes, 1000 blocks and 1 block of the same total size (in terms of number of transactions) will be 10 mins vs 166 hours, that's correct.
I guess the point we disagree on is that you feel that the current effective transaction throughput rate is ok.  I do not believe that miners' systems will come crumbling down if the blockchain grows faster.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:25


That is incorrect and explains why you have persisted in this line of reasoning. The TIME TO MINE A BLOCK IS 10 MINUTES. That's what the DIFFICULTY is for. The SIZE of the block (ie, the number of transactions) has little to no effect on the mining time. Even if it did, the difficulty would self adjust to maintain a mining time of 10 minutes. Edit: I misunderstood your intent there, sorry. I'll explain in next reply.
If 90% of the miners shutdown their machines, guess how long it would take to mine the blocks (once the difficulty adjusted at end of the next 2 week period)....10 minutes.
If the number of miners increased by 1000%, the mining time would be.....10 minutes.
I have a sneaking suspicion that you don't have a working understanding of the fundamentals of blockchain. I'm new to it, granted, but I've taken the time to review how it works.
Also, you're saying there is nothing wrong with a GLOBAL transaction system that can only handle 4-6 transactions per second. I'm sorry, but that is literally the most nonsensical thing I've ever read. 
I did not say it must scale to Visa proportions (40K transactions per second)...however, with BARELY any use...it's falling apart.
There is no VALUE in  reducing the supply of TRANSACTIONAL CAPABILITY, other than artificially driving up mining fees. CoffeeCoin? People can't get their money out of exchanges!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:49
Bitcoin's 10 minute blocks with a fixed block size means the # of sustained transactions per second is pitiful. A large backlog of transactions leads people to increase the transaction fees (in BTC),
 which is good for miners, bad for the actual usability of Bitcoin. Couple that with the increase in the USD value of the coin means the USD cost of a transaction in increases as well, even if the absolute transaction fee is the same in BTC. 
Here's the graph showing transaction costs over time:
 One year ago, transactions cost, on average USD$5. Now, they're ~$120.
So, now you have a mechanism which is slow and incredibly expensive. Unless something changes, the trend will continue. Edit: I guess there is LN coming. I should reserve judgement until we see how that goes.
BTC has the spotlight but the actual user experience as a payment mechanism is going to be a disaster, and there's no end in sight while the blocksize and block times remain the same.
How many first timers are going to say, "well, this crytocurrency has issues, maybe the others are better? I'll give 'em a try." Nope. Between that and BTC vs BCH branding, it's a slaughter in terms of confusion and frustration for people just getting into the space as consumers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:03
How cow. You're a developer? Yes 50k blocks 1 GB each will take less room...congratulations, you did math....but the wrong math.
You're looking at it the wrong way, and it's frustrating because if you're a dev, you'd think you'd have a grip on this basic premise.
Assume you have 1000 transactions to store, and they are 1K each in size. The transactions are going to take 1MB in total, right?
Now, you can GROUP them into blocks. Let's say you have a choice between 1k blocks, 100k blocks and 1M blocks. For utter simplicity, let's assume (incor
With 1k blocks, you're going to need to 1000 blocks to store the transactions. Total size...1MB.
With 100k blocks, you're going to need 10 blocks to store the transactions. Total size...1MB.
With 1MB blocks, you're going to need 1 block to store the transactions. Total size..1MB.
SIZE doesn't change. The # of transactions is what drives the total size. Now, remember, you only get 1 block every 10 minutes. 
What drives total size over time is the number of transactions, not the block size. The block size ALONE determines how many transactions you're processing at once assuming the rate at which you churn out blocks is constant.

fees are in BTC, not USD. Otherwise, I'm with ya. Per block BTC xfer fees have increased from ~0.8  (Jan 2017) to ~10 in Dec 2017. 
If it was simply the case that the BTC amount for xfer fees remained the same per byte and the USD value went up, we'd have little to complain about, but that's not what's happening. It is important, though, to focus just on the BTC fees, not so much the USD portion IMO.

It was a transaction that I was managing, it wasn't from an exchange.
See if you can find your transactions and check the ACTUAL fees. Compare them to what you're being charged. Either they're over paying for the transaction, or they're simply over charging you for it and using the transaction fees to make money.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:09:57
Paid 2.66 cents for my last transaction. Paid 4 cents before that.  What are you talking about with the high fees? That was months ago.

“Another explanation is that a large amount of new hashing power has come online, which has increased the frequency at which blocks are found. This would increase the capacity of the network.”
This implies that the network will get ‘faster and faster’ as time goes on. The difficulty is readjusted every 2 weeks to allow for network hashing power, such that it takes 10 mins, on average, to solve a block with the current hashing power. The network has been running ‘fast’ for MONTHS now. As a result, your statement on this facet is inaccurate. be sure to understand how the network WORKS before posting comments about capacity. Misinformation is not a good thing.

Your expectations must be super low. My last transaction ( had a fee of 0.0000035 BTC.

My last transaction was right around $0.02, so you paid 15x too much. That said, it doesn't matter a great deal...the fees are low enough to not have to worry about it either way.

It used to be that a block would contain 4-6 BTC worth of TX fees (good news for the miners). Now, I see blocks with &lt; 0.5 BTC worth of fees. With the insanity of the Dec rush behind us, transaction volume is down, so fees are way down. Segwit has barely made a dent, unless I'm missing something.
Segwit is great for reducing TX fees when the weighted fee/byte is high, and also to increase transaction throughput by effectively permitting a larger block size....but really, right now, neither of those are particularly needed based on current volume. Still good news, to be sure, but the drop in TX fees (in BTC, not just USD) would've happened without batching and without segwit, as much as I love 'em both.

Except we're actually 41 blocks ahead of schedule right now with a 3% increase in difficulty currently predicted (as of the time of this post). 
Seeing a couple of 'recent' blocks 13 mins apart doesn't give you a sense of the average. There will ALWAYS be blocks found earlier or later than the current difficulty calls for. It's a question of how it averages out over the two weeks.

Even if the TX isn't confirmed on the blockchain, your wallet knows what's up and won't let you send again. Unless I'm missing something, the only way to double spend would be to write your own malicious wallet software from the outset.
This may well become a thing in the future with vendors taking BTC and not relying on confirmations if the $ amount is less than a specific threshold.

If he specifically talked about mining, then you'll want to check for the presence of mining software on his machine. Do you have full access to his computer? If so, look through all of the programs, including links from the desktop. If you're not sure what a particular program does, google it and see if it's a mining tool.
If he was mining for a pool, chances are the mining pool was sending payouts on a regular basis, either to a wallet within his control, or potentially to an exchange where he had an account.
Definitely check for a wallet software (Bitcoin Core, Electrum, or others) and see how you do.

The xfer costs don't need to be THIS low for it to be successful, I would've been fine with 10-20 sat/byte but was in no rush for this xfer and wanted to see how long it'd take to get processed with such a low fee.

The fees should be lowered because high fees are not required for transactions to go through at this point, even if you're not using segwit.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:13:45
the TX fees are much more conducive to smaller transaction amounts now, you should definitely look into it again.
