Copying my answer from eariler:
(Welp formatting got lost in translation, sorry)
I am starting to convince myself this is an orchestrated pump and dump. There are many hedge funds who have delved deep into Bitcoin now, and what is going on looks like a classic strategy.
As I mentioned in the previous thread, this is my theory:
They are clumsily buying up coins, that is to say, they're not being subtle in how their orders are handled (which a stock trader would for instance, in order to prevent the price from going up before their full purchase is filled). This is to purposefully increase the price whilst increasing their stock.
When futures go live, buy puts (a put is a short position - i.e. price goes down, put value goes up) like there's no tomorrow, they'd likely go balls-deep in puts, expect huge order sizes on launch.
They will then chuck enormous sell blocks at the market to scare the shit out of all hodlrs, stimulating a price crash.
Put prices rocket on back of price pullback - sell puts at mega profit
Repurchase bitcoin or walk away with profit. More likely the former to rinse and repeat.
Pump and dumps are illegal in stocks, currency, etc. but would be much easier to hide in Bitcoin.
How to defend? Execute a short squeeze:
"A situation in which a heavily shorted stock or commodity (Bitcoin) moves sharply higher, forcing more short sellers to close out their short positions and adding to the upward pressure on the stock. A short squeeze implies that short sellers are being squeezed out of their short positions, usually at a loss."
By buyers rapidly increasing the price and volume at which they buy Bitcoin, we can "squeeze" shorters out of their positions. Look at Icahn vs. Ackman with their Herbalife battle as an example of a nicely executed squeeze. Ackman had to close out his short position and restructure a new short position.
Whilst these shorts are structured as futures, it means you can't technically squeeze anyone out of their position. However, if the BTC price were to continue going up, these futures would become worth less and less, and hedgies using leverage may be closed out by their brokers (if they don't increase margin cover) in effect being squeezed.
tl;dr - When Bitcoin price starts to plumment, buy Bitcoin.

I reckon they can get the price down to around $10k, if they close out their shorts above that levle, they'll be laughing. If they hold through (what I imagine would be) strong resistance at $10k, they'll be holding those till expiry... $0.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:22
You misunderstand me. I'm suggesting they're being clumsy on purpose to further fuel price escalation. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:07:14
I won't waste too much time arguing with you. If you'd bought into 90% of asset class dips in history you'd have made money. Go look at a stock market index...

Same, only one coin though. Kicking myself I didn't buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:39:45
I don't think you're getting down voted for observation, you're getting down voted for the assertion that people buying making the price go up doesn't make sense. Demand increase leading to a higher price is one of the most basic concepts of economics, and apart from that it's just instinctive. More buyers bidding against each other means sellers get a higher price.. just imagine an auction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:51:11
Good observation. What I was trying to outline was the basics of creating a short position; whether it be with options (buying puts or selling calls), a swap (derivative), a CFD (contract), through stock borrowing (a true short), or selling futures... the latter being how my above scenario would be structured. I felt going into the technicals of it would not better the readers understanding so described a simpler scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:13:40

When I bought in 4 years ago, at the price I did, I viewed its paradigm shifting potential (to the amount I could understand it) worth the punt for one coin. $400 could have easily gone to zero, but I thought at the time "this **could** be digital bullion". Having enjoyed thousands of % return on it, yeah, I reckon I understood it enough for such a small investment. I don't claim to know where it's going, just worth the risk of having a go in case it does.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:46:57
This is exactly what I was thinking. If I ran a large hedge fund, I'd be intentionally buying bitcoin right now "clumsily" to intentionally inflate prices. Next week load up on shorts then dump my entire stack very clumsily to tank the market.

PERSONALLY - I wouldn't chuck in an enormous amount right now, I'd dribble in a few hundred $'s a day, if prices go up - great. If prices go down, you get cheaper Bitcoin.
With that said, if prices hit $40k next week, I'd have regretted not going balls deep straight away...
It's up to you, **speculate with what you can afford to lose**.

If you understood my post, you'd see that I was proposing people buy Bitcoin when Futures are being traded and if the price starts haemorrhaging - I **never** mentioned buying now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:07
Based on your post history I'm going to guess this is a bit of a fib.

The exact mentality you've outlined in the second half of your comment answers your original question... people are "getting in" whilst they can and this is creating huge demand. 
With respect to the first half, using that mentality you would have never bought shares in amazon, google, Berkshire, tesla, Netflix etc etc... when things go up more than down on average, it's usually better to get in now rather than later.

Unfortunately this is more risk than it's worth, no matter the price. As a buyer we run the risk of you shouting your mouth off about how you "RMT'd" your account when everything is sold off and we get our accounts banned.

The fact that **arbitrage** funds are looking to buy in would indicate they are looking to sell on immediately...By whatever method.  
  
"arbitrage (/ˈɑrbɨtrɑːʒ/) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. For instance, an arbitrage is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy low and sell high."

I get it mate, you didn't get in under $1000 so now you're bitter AF and can't wait for it to go to zero so you can say "See, I was right to never get involved" - but that won't change the fact that the rest of us made a butt-ton of money I'm afraid. So stop being bitter and go away.

Thanks, yeah I only bought Bitcoin, when they were around the £300-£400 mark as a long term holding and never bought/sold/used any since.
