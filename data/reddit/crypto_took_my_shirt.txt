They get bitcoin for the positive articles and fiat for the negative articles. Can't lose!

Curious, wasnt hating :) 
I know reddit uses their own if you didnt put one in is all. And anything with the ? at the end is a tracking item.

Except they didn't take any genie out of a bottle... the genie was created and maintained by people that want a different system than they have been regulating for decades.

They've never been against fucking up the site to make money previously

Pretty sure they are going on a blockchain and ICO'ing like everything else

No. 
This is a paid post so some bitcoin casino gets links to their site... its pretty obvious. 
Hodling earns us more than gambling with bitcoin ever will.

Is it reddit or ops affiliate link to click there?

Sounds more like a "legacy" gold hodler than one of us... 


Surprised reddit allows this:

PBoC is almost certainly going to announce a cenralized cryptocurrency in one form or another. And as usual, it's good for bitcoin...
More users adopt the idea that internet money has value. People realize that a government crypto doesn't let them control their money. They still end up in bitcoin down the road, it's just a longer road and higher price to get in later.

This is more important for bitcoin that all the price threads we constantly have here. 
A 50% price drop in BTC would look GOOD to a Venezuelan that held it over the Bolivar there. At least you could leave the country and still buy food in other countries.

I think this time next year we will be more aware of whats going on with banks and governments plans currently. Notice they are all very quiet after so many people we hyping the "new financial system" all of 2017. 
Whatever the "plan" is for cryptos to work within the existing financial markets, isn't going to be clear for a LONG time but things are definitely going on in the background. More of an altcoin/token thing but that affects bitcoin prices as long as those continue being the wild west.

Am with you. The website there for a coffee shop just makes it look tacky.
