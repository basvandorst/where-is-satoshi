I had them at the time and sold around $250 because I needed the money for school and thought it wouldn't go much higher.  I don't regret it though because without cashing them in I wouldn't have been able to complete my degree in Classical Voice performance.  
To clarify I am not complaining about my situation...more or less just getting my tiny tale out there and seeing what people think!

upmost importance - the facade ends there...

hence this post!  Just letting the community know how proud I am of my bro and how I plan to stand by my bet.  What an amazing turn of events!
Oddly enough I might be getting a "big kid" job this week and plan to try to invest some money to put towards his BTC fund :-)

hmm...I suppose you have a problem with me posting a "meaningless" post to your beloved r/bitcoin - I apologize and will immediately let you get back to your serious business - heaven forbid someone have a real life story related to bitcoin that they want to share with fellow bitcoin enthusiasts.

damn some of these people must have shoved too many bitcoins up their ass and cant fish them out...way too much hate for someone genuinely trying to help people get a grasp on what many view as a complex system.
Much love OP!

just-dice is scary - I had two different accounts get hacked and lost 2btc in 4 days all from hacking...a lesson learned on using the google authenticator I suppose...

the site link wont work for me - but if and when it does, does there seem to be decent security for the accounts there because I have had 4btc jacked from me from 2 different sites - one even when I had a google authenticator...and I know it wasn't from my comp.  Just curious because I don't want to invest in more bitcoins just to have them stolen - I would rather lose them on my own!
