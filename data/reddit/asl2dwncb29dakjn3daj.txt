Honest question here: doesn't lightning change the game? Why did you specifically mentioned on-chain transactions?

Does LN requires 2 users to open a channel on the main network (bitcoin) in order to transact? 
If yes, does this means most LN txs will be made between companies and users (since companies will already have a channel open)?
Trying to understand this complex tech.

Perhaps the best return on investment should be thought of as something in the proximity of this: if you payed for, or bought something, that has a life long value now, you have made a worthy decision - regardless of the future value of bitcoin.

It's funny how officials are not even pretending to work for the people any more.

What substantial meaning does this have? Zero. It's a centralized token by a centralized entity. They will just update their registry ("blockchain") and it's a done deal.

how do U deposit money into the app? And don't they price their coins way higher than Gemini/Coinbase/Circle?

I applaud you for your hard work. I am not a fan of the design though. That's just me maybe. Delta is the benchmark in terms of design. No shame in learning from them (:
