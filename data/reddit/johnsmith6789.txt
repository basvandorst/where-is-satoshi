You know what, I'm a dumbass. Please excuse me.

We're in agreement. 
The Rothschild's are the inventors of central banking. All I am saying is that they can contract out IBM like they have done before.

These people have the attitude to succeed. They treat their customers very well. The phone call I received was courteous and I expect to get my Bitcoins soon.
If this fraud detection method doesn't succeed, these people will succeed elsewhere. 
I wish them all the best! Keep serving the customers like you do now!

It was Amir and Intersango that started this "regulated business" bullshit. 
"We have to work with government blahblahblah." 
God, I am finally glad to see a rational voice speak against this so clearly.

There never was a Bitcoin magazine. It was all vaporware.
Soon Matthew will tell us his plan to secretly invest all of our preorder money on Bitcoinica has failed.

Also, you guys are going to think I am the biggest suck-up ever but I want to let you guys know what you are doing right:
The website interface makes fucking sense unlike a lot of crap out there. It's to the point. A two year old could buy Bitcoins on here. The design is easy on the eyes while being elegant. 
By all means, I hope you guys displace Mt. Gox with this. I strongly admire what you are doing. Please keep it up!

80% of Israel is owned by the Rothschilds: The same owners of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, The Federal Reserve and other major banking institutions.
Israel is dangerous territory for Bitcoin. I don't know if we should be informing the well-to-do in that country.

That only validates my theory. If people make a habit of spamming the blockchain, people will start using only young coins as time goes on.

What if I were to launder my coins through services?

Thank you for the bitcoins I just received! 
Getting Bitcoins within 24 hours is certainly quick and well-worth your surcharges.
