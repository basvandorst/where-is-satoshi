sometimes threads like this remind me that much of BTC speculation is built on greed

Couldn't agree more. I spent too much money buying 2 BTC in the fall of 2014 so I had to sell them back.
As of today my profit would've been over $700 and counting.
Now I am left a little nervous to get back into BTC, would y'all advise I invest in an affordable amount right now even with the price artificially higher before the halvening?
Edit: this wouldnt be for a short term gain, but rather to start investing in btc again before it takes off over $1000 in the coming years.

That was the default when I downloaded it, should I delete that and redownload in the directory you mentioned? And that space you mentioned was a transfer error

In the process of redownloading QT and am now getting this error message: Cannot obtain a lock on data directory C:\Program Files \Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is probably already running. The system cannot find the file specified..
I cant view the wallet and the blockchain history halted around 19 weeks out.
What should I do?

Not that I'm one of those people who think bitcoin will disappear, but how much of a guarantee is it that btc will implode as everyone says? The devils-advocate in me wants to justify not investing in them.

Are wallet passwords given seed phrases (usually a list of random words) or created by the user?

Update: I recovered the wallet after redownloading bitcoin QT. .75 BTC i thought I'd lost. Only issue is the wallet is encrypted and I don't remember there being any password so i cannot send any. If i cannot remember/find the password, have I lost these for good?
