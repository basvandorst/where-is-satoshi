My screen just "unfroze" and it seems the transaction didn't go through/was canceled because it is not listed within "last operations" category and my balance (on the ledger) seems to be intact.

I only have the options "Settings", "about" and "quit the app" (that leaves the "ledger wallet - bitcoin" app and comes back to the main menu).

Are you serious? This was a fee you paid when transferring from a cold storage wallet?

I guess its not that bad then - I had to wait for over a day the last time ive did a transaction. I am thinking of turning some of my BTC into ETH. Between kraken, cex,io and bitfinex, which one would you guys recommend?

Just to be clear, I did look at the ledger, every 5 seconds or so. Either the there's something wrong with my ledger, the mempool is clogged again, or my fee was too low. I'm thinking of selecting the high fee option next time, yet considering the scenario that transpired was highly unusual, I am not sure if that is going to be enough.

Lovin' the username, but it's not done. The exchange I've sent it to shows me that my balance is exactly the same it was before this transaction.

That's the thing - my ledger seems to be stuck in the window shown in my screenshot. There doesn't seem to be anything for me to do.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:18:34
But only one transaction ended up going through, correct? Because this sort of scenario seems to indicate, that both of them have been confirmed. By the way, what was the fee that you ended up paying the second time (the "highest" option or perhaps youve input your own custom fee)?

Unfortunately, it does not. This screen is the only thing that is shown (and it cannot be interacted with in any way).

It is sad to see that even a simple Christmas message is causing anger nowadays. Still, I wish that you have a marvelous day!

No, I have not, could you tell me how could I do that? Right now my ledger is connected to the pc, and I can't seem to escape the blasted "verifying transaction" screen. I know it probably silly, but I have some irrational fears about disconnecting the ledger while it is, supposedly, in mid-transaction.

Interesting, I've heard nothing but bad things about them lately. Plus, cex.io tends to have a better BTC price. Have you worked with binance?

Quite a neat thingy you've got there. I fully know I have 0% of winning it, but nevertheless - props for doing this man. May you have merry, cheerful and warm Holidays fellow Bitcoin brothers and sisters!
Never stop Hodl'ing!

I was wondering what are your thoughts about the upcoming Bitcoin forks (Bitcoin platinum, Bitcoin Cash Plus, etc).  Are they a worthless waste of time and resources? Or do they possess an opportunity for real growth? Back with the previous forks, it was enough to just have your BTC in cold storage to qualify for the forked coin, is this still the case with the upcoming December and January forked coins? 
Thank you for your time and energy put in this reply!

Not exactly a beginner, yet I understand what you're getting at. Considering my BTC are kept safe in multiple Ledger Nano S wallets, I'm sure it's safe to say the airdrop crap is headed my way. Either way, Bitcoin is far too strong to be seriously affected by these mosquitoes. Thank you for your input!

Basically, but if it can be sold to buy more BTC...
Why the heck not?
