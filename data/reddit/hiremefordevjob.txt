I already received a tip but thank you very much. I will send that to a redittor on a default sub
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:32:22
Now just collect it and send it to a wallet!

Thanks for all that you have done. I have told many friends (well 3) about tipping Tuesday and actually got them to consider getting into bitcoin. Thanks for everything

Going down to $190 then up from there. I see bitcoin sub $200 for the short term then skyrocketing up once the "right" people have it.
Please also realize I am a huge promoter of bitcoin. I work at a place that's main clients are banks. I mention bitcoin quiet often to the higher ups.  
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:41:59
easy of use.
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:31:01
I will most definitely not cash out.  Big coin is the future. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:50:54
Lets say it only "kinda" takes off you'll still have more than you started! Good news will only bring us down for so long. I see Bitcoin as the future and the global leader in currency. I have 80% in bitcoin right now. Unfortunately I can't pay my rent in coin :(
When I can though I will!

People like whole numbers. Satoshi couldve have made it 1 bitcoin market cap that can be divisible. This 21 million coins that are being rolled out slowly allow the market to be "fairly" distributed. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:01:24
The government just needs to keep screwing over its citizens. They will come, they always come. The problem is by the time most people are interested in bitcoin they have no money.
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:15:13
People have an emotional attachment to price. Going under $200 would be rough for us all. However that would allow a huge potential of movement for big players. I don't think bitcoin could really go down much further than that. Once there is a big enough upward movement from sub $200 upwards we shouldn't see but a few bumps in the road to a much higher market cap.
There were a lot of people saying $90 is the bottom. I just can't see that happening. Especially with the mining reward halving soon.

No mine does not. My phone is jail broken. Also I would use an actual camera. Not a phone

As in shortcuts to the hashing algorithm. Extremely unlikely and I am aware how ridiculously hard to brute for he sha256 is just wondering if anyone tried to mess around with the two at the same time. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:41:20
Why so harsh? I don't exactly understand. There is literally no context you are basing this off of. I understand you believe it will fail. So be it. Even if my idea fails I will be overjoyed to see if my idea is able to spark interest upon other users to better execute it.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:31:11
Well thats what would happen if you took bitcoin away.
Edit your to you
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:42:04
Also did you really just make an account to let me know it will fail?
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:50:58
Thank you! I'm actually going to buy a beer with that I think I have a fee places around here that accept it!

I understand that however at one point only a couple thousand people traded that many.

Typing fast big idea in head rushed this out.
edit: I apologize this was dumb and I should not have typed this comment out. It just shows immaturity. My mistake.

Liquid that turns to vapor would be considered what?  Answer that for me 
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:04:28
I really only do web development however I'm still in college. I have a lot to learn. However, I possess a lot of passion and work ethic. I am by no means an expert on bitcoin nor how it works. I wouldn't even consider myself an amatuer just looking for a place to help.
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:57:56
Sounds good I work in real estate. At an AMC technology company right now. Wouldn't mind something I'm passionate about doing on the side.

This has anything and everything to do with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:37:52
No I don't believe so. I know there are people always trying to find holes in analogies and this was the one the best I could come up with.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:33:46
Didn't we all

So now you say computer things are done by unintelligent people. Please go on with your wisdom. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:29:32
Only if we let it. If the community does not think it will be a benefit to society then it does not need to be forced as a benefit. This will succeed if it is helpful and only if it is helpful. If this is a bad idea I hope it fails too. I wouldn't want to make something and pretend it will fix something. I only want it to succeed if it is meant to.

mainly the people using bitcoin right now are traders. until this is more mainstream stability will be swayed easily with the market cap fluctuations.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:43:32
lmao they just want yer coins.
