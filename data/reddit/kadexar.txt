Bitcoin futures has nothing to do with actual bitcoins. This is just people betting on what the price will be in the future.
Now if I had to bet myself, considering how early it is still and that the price is what it is when only 0,2% of people own bitcoins, the safer bet in my opinion is that the price will be a lot higher in the years to come. I expect a slight dip in the coming days and then quickly back up.

You could also ignore Bitcoin 2 years ago. But ask the people who didn`t what they think.

Why are people upvoting this?? Does no one have a brain anymore? Or at least simple google skills.
Nasdaq, being the best performer, is at a level of 01.Jan, while S&amp;P 500, NYSE, Wilshire and Dow Jones were last this price at around mid December, Nikkei is at levels of October, and Daxx hasnt been this low since beginning of September last year. And FTSE is at lowest since April of last year. Yes, April.
