What would you class financial asset in this case? 
Would a private island be a financial asset?
Also if your computer is seized then you're no longer in control.

It feels like Bitcoin really just lives and dies by the hype. I see no benefit to something so volatile.
People hating of fiat currencies but at least I know unless some spectacular catastrophe happens that my £1 = $1.40 when I wake up in the morning. Heck, even then it's climbing to pre Brexit levels.
What's stopping Bitcoin from tanking all the way down to $1 in the next couple of months?

I mean, you can buy and sell drugs with crypto, no one knows what you could be using it for. You could be using it for cheese pizza or pumping cash into some terroist organisation. 
At the end of the day, the bank did good, they don't want investigations done on their company if something goes bad down the line, it would make them look bad.


There you go though. How do they know you're not doing anything bad? The whole point of Bitcoin is anonimity no?

Replaced by a greater platform.

Bitcoin will hit $100,000 sure. 
If you believe in the multiverse theory.
The coin is on a downward trend where it's going to keep dropping more than it recovers. 
In fact, that's all it has ever done since it hit the peak.

Looking at graphs of the past month Bitcoin is on a downward trend. When it does gain it loses it soon after and then some.

How are shitcoins stoppable though?
The only reason Bitcoin gets growth is the hype it gets from the news and other outlets.
At the end of the day, bitcoin is going to grow old, and it's going to get replaced. These "shitcoins" are probably the ones that will replace it. 
Technology works by proving a concept and evolving on that concept, if Bitcoin is the beginning of cryptos it's going to have an end. 
Besides, competition is good, without competition we wouldn't get breakthroughs and advancements in technology. 
If you only want Bitcoin to exist it's going to eventually be outdone and replaced by something better and much more efficient in the future.

Why are they shitcoins though?
They have the same purpose, unless you mean they're shit because you don't make as much money off them.

You're really going to hit me with a strawman argument? TCP/IP isn't even remotely similar to what I'm talking about. It's difficult to replace something that doesn't need replacing when it does need improving it gets improved.


So you agree with me that it's a concept that is being evolved upon, constantly being refined so it doesn't fall behind the times, right?


Right, like aircraft, land vehicles, computers. There will be a time that some things die out, and replace the old. Bitcoin will inevitably become one of them sooner or later. The history of money spans thousands of years, paper money a thousand years. Bitcoin isn't going to scratch the surface, especially if it continues on its downwards trend.

Why is bitcoin allowed to exist but they aren't?
I don't see your point here. People argue the point of bitcoins is the ability to move away from fiat and gain other advantages, yet you're only allowed one cryptocurrency?
I find it slightly ironic really.

I mean, same could be said about Bitcoin though, it always took a hit as soon as rumours started circulating about countries banning it or shutting trading centers down. 


Much like anything and everything, look where Da Vincis understandings of bird flight led us. Bitcoin is unfortunately finite, and the quicker people realise that, the more stable the market will be. 
Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is an interesting technology, but unless it stables out it's never going to get its place as a long lasting currency.

You can have a coalition with two parties, not sure what the issue is here. 


The problem here lies in the use of chemical weapons. Chemicals weapons are flat out outlawed, they provide instant, delayed and lasting effects on the population, they can also be a pollutant which cant stick around for decades making land unusuable or a danger to life. [Such an example](
The point is to show the world that chemical weapons are a no no. It means no other country is going to say "They are using chemical weapons? Well that's not fair I want to use them to." And so the snowball effect begins.

Is it not a downwards trend? 
Looking at graphs it consistently loses more than it gains.
