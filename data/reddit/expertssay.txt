Statistically more likely actually. If my extrapolation of marketing classes is worth anything

Also minus transaction costs, that would be more money than he found...

I'm not asking whether you can afford it. I'm asking why you'd give a bunch of completely unknown people money?
I don't understand what you're buying with that.
P.S. Yes yes beggars, downvote me.

And this is what happens when some manager tries to be edgy without understanding technology. Also, the project will be called off because of a "lack of customer interest in BTC". Give him his bonus already

Wow that sucks. If this was me, it would be time to invest in more secure mailboxes then. Community funded with a pitch in by the landlord if this problem affects everyone. 
A whole wall sized battery of metal mailboxes with an internal Z shaped slope and the same quality locks (and allowing the same key) as your Apartments door.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:38:08
I think location and ease of access of the mailbox may be a factor. Never in my life have I heard a single case of stolen mail

I always loved this argument. BTCs hash power mainly comes from ASIC farms and can't be properly run on any normal computer since 2015. How are big blocks making BCH any more of an industrial-grade crypto? They both are eqully fucked.

For what reason would you consider a give away? Whats the rationale behind that?

Or the equivalent present from the smart kid brother. A really weird poem with seemingly minimal coherence
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:53:32
Ok thats a valid reason at least. Focus on the ones that really helped you though. Look at your post history. The ones that come out of the woodwork only after you announce free money are usually not the ones helping you for free.
Just my 2 satoshi...
P.S. I definitely did not help. So I'm not talking about me.

You post a title like that as if you're a third party that "just found out" but run with that username?

There is a whole Elon musk threat on right now. Without taking sides, I think not accepting (privately) cunty peoples contributions to society is as naive as it gets. 
Next time someone comes by a candidate for "rocket scientist mother Theresa" please wake me up. I would give Ted Bundy personally a standing ovation if he came up with a solution for global warming. And no, that wouldn't excuse him, obviously.

Find a little kid to say the dumb sentences and keep the volume more consistent between the voice and your narration. The rest is nice

Massively inhibit, yes.
As with anything, the likelihood of all governments pulling the same string is nill because of differing agendas and interest. If you e.g. try to lock in your people in monetary policy, you will. If you try to e.g. circumvent constant trade embargos, you'd rather keep the doors open.

What does any of this have to do with the original argument? 


That might be true locally. Scarcity coming from the prohibition, not the general coin limit. So as with drugs, you might demand a crazy price if you're standing on a public square in Beijing selling coins. But you won't use an exchange to make use of prices in a prohibited area from your sofa at home, so thats of no concern to you (or most of us non-chinese for that matter)

It doens't make powers turn. It just fucks with the usual game. But one needs to honestly ask whether building a nuclear bomb and then letting everyone play with it, really leads to a shift of power... 
The trick in competitive advantages is to not let the enemy take part. BTC now has half of the banking world invested. And those buddies are subject to regional laws and way closer to homo economicus than any normal person. They are easy to manipulate with incentivization and policy because they trade like AIs in an optimization problem. 
So big govs still have the power. If they change policy, the bankers and funds jump ship and the price plummets, I wanna see the BTC hardliners stay put for idiological reasons...

Remember this new law in china regarding online identites and criticism vs the gov?...
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:54:42
You're both right. The storage of value however is largely influenced by speculative investments of financial novices that would follow applicable laws. Especially with the amount of transparency on the BTC BC. I think the price would at least suffer in the short term. It has to, for practical reasons.
