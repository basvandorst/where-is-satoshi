Because if YOU have a Coinbase wallet, that means that YOUR coins are on Coinbase's system and they can transfer the amount instantly off chain.  If you wanted to use a 3rd party wallet, then the merchant would have to wait for 3 confirmations (min) to be safe and that would take min a few minutes up to a couple hours.

They  can't send a 1099 because they don't know your entire basis to go from.  The odds of any information on a 1099 generated from them being correct are slim.  As an example, you could be holding some of your BTC in external addresses.  How do they tell the difference between you buying a car from your friend or sticking some of your BTC in a personal wallet.

He "sold" his bitcoin at the point that he surrendered it for a service, activity, purchase, etc.  So, yes he does owe on the capital gain/loss of the original BTC USD value at the time of the bet.  Sometimes, it's easier if you think of it as bartering transactions.  A person wants to rent an apartment and pays for it in hand carved dolls.  The dolls are valued according to the market value of the rent (assuming there isn't a specific doll market valuation).  Even though there is no cash exchanged, there is a taxable event.  If you're dealing with something that might bring on not only scrutiny, but automated tools to support that scrutiny, I would report it all.

Don't forget the original transaction.  When you sent a $ value of bitcoin (spent) to the gambling place, that was either a capital gain/loss from the original $value that you paid for that bitcoin.

Did anyone else notice the insane number of emails they claim to be processing?  When I was on the site, it seemed like they were processing over 400 / minute.  Doesn't that seem like a lot of transfers?
