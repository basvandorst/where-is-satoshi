Imagine being able to simply send bitcoin to a 'rent-a-robot' 'bike rack' at the great wall of china, and get 1 hour of robot time to roll up and down the great wall Same could be done for any tourist attraction area or even city in general. Want to see the Louvre? Sure, just send $20 in btc to x address and your mini-me comes to life and you can roam around zooming in on the art. Need more time? Just send a bit  more btc to extend your 'life'. once your time runs out, robot automatically drives itself back to the charging station like a Roomba. 
Add a little tray, lockable pouch, and gps tracker and soon you can head to that 1 store that's only in Switzerland and buy yourself some chocolates. Pay in bitcoin by having them scan their qr code at your camera. Head across the street to the post office, and have them pack and ship your chocolates to back to you across the Atlantic. 
Oh the possibilities. Please arrive soon, future.

I think I would like to order this same shoe/style. can you show me which one it in on the website, or if it is displayed? How much did you pay for the shoe and for shipping?
@_date: 2014-08-11 03:31:00
Correct; that's to eliminate confusion with the 10btc 'Gold B' which has no gold rim.

I have written an eBook about these coins. find it FREE at

I ordered a direct deposit from my ban on may 27th, but i was told yesterday that because they screwed up, it may not go through until June 11th. 2 weeks man... 
should have just bought on localbitcoins for a few % overhead and not missed the rise.
@_date: 2014-07-21 12:55:07
Yes truly amazing. This really erodes the concept of states, borders, and the concept of presence. Remember the whole concept of being a 'foreign spy'...well, shit. I can just get mini-me rolling in Gaza and who knows whose on the other end.
What happens when the the first robot mugging happens? Wait till people attach guns to them and have them wait around ally-ways at night, and mothers tell their kids to not go out at night or the killer robots may get you. After all, can you arrest a robot? You will literally be able to do anything, and simply disconnect the machine and have it tied to you in no way whatsoever.
As for the chocolate eating; if that was possible i don't think even buying it would be necessary, as we could simply download the taste. But, aslong as nobody downloads cars I guess it's ok, right?
wtf am I doing getting an arts degree... halp, Im a nerd

probably mid September. It will be free on the same site, but donations are very much appreciated/requested.
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:19:14
There are no known counterfeits with the hologram sticker. There may be some imitations of the 'coin' itself without the security sticker, but no, the ones on ebay are legit. Check out the ebook guide at  there is some info about potential imitations

There's an eBook about all the Casascius coins
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:16:05
shibemint rocks!
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:31:01
Fair enough. I still (and i believe most here) respectfully disagree with you. I see it no differently then a failed bank, due to amazingly poor management. Mt.Gox had its time and place, and made great contributions to Bitcoin; but its game is over at this point. There are reportedly other companies bidding on the exchange name, and it is possible it will be restarted under new management; but surely at-least 90% of all lost funds are gone for good.
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:47:06
if you have to ask, its out of your scope of ability. basically its running computers to 'dig' for new bitcoin. Dont worry about it :)
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:21:47
Ive written an ebook about casascius coins. its free at 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:04:03
Hello, i sent you a PM earlier and was hoping you could connect with me. I have written a free ebook about casascius coins and am working on another to include all crypto physicals.
You can find my work at  I invite everyone to check it out.
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:35:25
my main concern is this; will it keep up with itself relative to btc value? allow me:
Right now i might get 4 or 5btc worth of $ for it; which i could put back to btc.
Assume btc hits 10k this year; 5btc would be worth 50k. Could my coin keep up with that? (assuming that currently; the 'collectible' value is a certain %)
assume we hit 100k in some years... 500k vs...?
i think for the medium term 5bt might be a better bet then the coin

ebay has selling limits; i cant sell above $2500 a month. also; i dont trust paypal enough to send it to someone; they could just say they never got it i sent an empty package. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:17:26
thats about right, but on the high end. 2btc is more correct at current rates
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:39:13
 is who all the North's BTC belongs to
@_date: 2014-08-11 03:29:39
quite a while. I am actually working on a much longer book (~150 pages) to detail ALL coins by ALL manufacturers.

im moreso looking for a place to sell. but your right. andmany coin collectors might see more value in it then i do; i ofcourse could be wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:43:02
You clearly have no background in business. For-profit companies dont get charity; things dont work that way (unless of-course bail-out money from a government) 
Why support a failed business, when there are many new, promising exchanges run by actually competent business people?
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:11:34
I am also in for at-least 1% (3btc) or more if this happens; please PM me if your organizing.

guy seems a bit paranoid, but...
Lets say btc ends up being huge and going 'to the moon'. you might become a target if ppl know/think you have 10.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:23:51
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:02:40
yes; quite amazing.

Just wait till it becomes a common phrase in rap
I can see it now (except such an amount could soon be completely out of reach of all but the richest rappers)
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:41:08
