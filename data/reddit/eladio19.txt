There's one catch, blocksize increase doesn't depend on all those lazy exchanges to implement segwit / lightning to optimize the current blockchain, and it also would be working at the same time it is active.
The problem with the WHEN is mitigated if core decided to roll out the increase now and allow enough time (6 months - 1 year) for it to be active, like it was intended with segwit2x but more time (as well as keeping the current devs) but if they never announce it, then we're delaying things indefinitely.

@_date: 2018-01-23 12:27:37
I want to see that, just checked  and it's still at 10%, both tx and each block individually.
Also what's your fucking problem? The guy stated some correct facts and you're acting like a jerk.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:35:12
Segwit is not based on sat/b, that's just the equivalent. The correct term to use is sat/vb or weight. We want to teach people that segwit doesn't magically reduce the fee, but the size of the transaction, hence lowering fees.

And Ripple ends up fucking himself in the butt, coincidence?
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:16:01
The number of transactions included in a block doesn't mean anything, it's the size (or weight in our case) that can fill in a block and how well optimized is the transaction to make each one take less space.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:08:10
I can't do it as an individual, this must be a consensus amoung users, devs and miners. It seems the ones that's left for this are the devs to agree and set an schedule in the software to a time that's enough for users / miners to switch.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:00:47
I don't understand, only the quotes that match the core ideology are posted here, what about this? Said by the creator of all of this, Satoshi Nakamoto.










































I agree with 2nd layers, but we need a blocksize increase in the meanwhile they're implemented, it's sad to see bitcoin dying a little each day by the fees &amp; mempool issue.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:16:58
Since you're using segwit, state things as they are, you paid 126 sat/vb. There's no way a 80 sat/vb could get confirmed now as mempool hasn't finished clearing the 100-140 range.
Your tx: 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:53:46
The most logical and "tabu" thing in increase the block size to a higher prudent one while 2nd layers and optimizations (Schnorr, MAST) are fully deployed on the network.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:47:56
There're plently raspberry pi running on 1gb doing fine, so bitfury studies on ram is not fully reflecting the reality, however they make a note in this regard:


















The keypoint on this is "The set does not have to reside completely in RAM, although other storage methods lead to elevated transaction verification time.". Given the 10mins per block interval, this is something non-mining nodes can consider, and mining nodes surely have the resources to go plenty on their hardware, so they're not affected by this.
Your other study is more flexible about the best outcome for scaling bitcoin network, at evens mentions that at the time of that study, the network shouldn't exceed 4mb blocks at 10m blocks interval.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:02:07
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:19:59
The real bottleneck is and always be bandwith/latency. Storage is cheap, and we're not talking about 10x increase, even 4x is enough (a simple processor and 2gb-4gb ram can do the job, and that's not expensive to begin with)
I live in Venezuela, people here are not thinking about running a full node at all, more about what they will eat the next day (if they do at all), also the government is looking over to take all the banks and nationalize them, bitcoin is the only tool to escape this nightmare, BUT the fees to do a simple transfer exceeds one person full month wage (if you do not believe me, go google it). I'm almost sure other 3rd world countries are in the same position, and if letting go some poor countries (way too low to cause an impact in decentralization) of being "able" to run a full node means they can use bitcoin paying decent fees, it makes the best outcome for all.
The problem with LN is that it's not fully working, heck even segwit is stuck at 10% adaption for months! The blocksize increase can go along with 2nd layers, they're not mutually exclusive, but in the meanwhile it will heal some of this very dangerous situation where bitcoin is unusable unless you pay outrageous fees, which in your case people living in 3rd world, won't be able to. 
We need to make the system be decently functional before 2nd layers fully deploys, not waiting them to be the "miracle" that solves all of this.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:30:29
If a single company can have so much impact on bitcoin quality, then we need to improve the software.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:14:34
I agree with you, most people are so focused on 2nd layer solutions but the issue is they are not completely working right now! A simple blocksize increase would mitigate the issue while the other solutions are adopted. I honestly think the fee issue is hurting bitcoin more than the hard fork over a blocksize increase will.
Also when the block reward is over, where are going to get miners profit? it must come from fees, so a blocksize increase is REQUIRED in the long term, because miners doesn't profit as much from 2nd layer solutions and they're the one who keep the network secure. 
Not everybody is supposed to run a node, it's better if more people can use bitcoin without overpaying fees than being able to run a node and keeping the 1MB limit.

Why complicate things, the only tip that matters is HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:00
More block space = more fees to collect and less fees paid for every user, use your logic.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:36:36
According to  it has been below 12% last week.
Don't know if you're being sarcasting on last statement, but I'm not judging devs, they're excellent at programming, the problem is that this issue is not about their competence to do a blocksize increase (many forks already did that with a shady team) but mostly a political choice, that's why we don't see an update about an increase for now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:10
It would be better than instead of selling all at once, just sell enough to your daily needs, that way you won't regret if the price keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:14:09
The problem with segwit is that it's opt-in. And as you can see adoption is around 10%, we can't blame the users for not using something optional, even if it's better for all of us. A blocksize increase it's not optional therefore we don't need to trust users to use to make changes for 100% adoption, instead it's working since it's implemented and nobody but miners and nodes needs to adjust their software.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:30:38
So accurate
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:59:50
It was only 150 sat/byte which is average right now, remember fees are based on size not on amount.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:03:48
Average fee is around $3 not $14, I agree bitcoin is not worth it for sending small amount nows, honestly I think if a block size increase was implemented while the LN and Segwit adoption is in progress this issue would be mitigated by a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:39:10
That chart is misleading, "ATH" for mempool was almost 300k a few days ago, now it's around 180k and decreasing.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:10:58
The issue is, bitcoin was never meant for every user to run a full node, that's simply no sense. You can't expect all users to get technical to run a full node when a SPV wallet makes it very easy. Technology upgrades over time and 1mb is not a magical number, it must be increasing accordingly with time. Also there is less than 1% of all bitcoin users running a full node (around 12k now, this sub has 600k users and there're a lot of them not using reddit/not suscribed, also many of those nodes are run by same individuals), do you think it is as it because "centralization"? No, it's because they don't care and not all users need to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:26:59
You paid 100 sat/b and we're in the 100-140 range, if you're lucky it may confirm today
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:43:04
I really like Electrum, but I have to disagree about the dynamic fees, they're set by the server you're connected to, and they're poorly doing their job (For example, I just ticked "use dynamic fees" and it prompted me to use 787 sat/byte for middle slider) so it's better to disable that and manually set the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:03:35
Of course users are not the only responsible, if the devs implemented a block size increase while we wait for LN this wouldn't be happening, but now we have 2 options: help mitigate the problem or leave for another alt.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:03:59
That graph is not accurate, check 
You can see 140-200 sat/byte are clearing and some 100-140 ones.
Avg normal tx 226 bytes --- between $3.8 and $7.6 for fast conf
Avg Segwit tx 138 bytes --- between $2.3 and $4.6 for fast conf
No need to overpay and make the problem worse than it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:00:04
FYI Localbitcoin has batching by a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:27
I agree with your completely, I'm not concerned by the price but the mempool and fee issue, it's a huge turn down for many people to see this shit show.
I can't even comprehend why a block size increase can't be deployed while the other solutions are ready, 1MB is not a magical number and technology have grown a lot by 2010 when the constrain was made so we can be safe a modest upgrade to 4-8mb won't hurt in terms of disk storage, latency and network usage.
I makes less of a sense than using bitcoin 3-4 times is more expensive than purchasing the hardware to run a full node, I sincerely hope the core devs take actions on this and don't let bitcoin sink while waiting for solutions that are needed in the long term, but for now an action needs to be done.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:15:47
If the final product will be so easy and fast to use like the one in the video, then we will surely alleviate the mempool issue.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:04:36
I agree with you completely, but the current software solutions doesn't allow for the average joe to do the right things at first, that's why we need to contribute mitigate the fee issue, remember this is an open source project.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:30:58
Even though it's not a charity, consider donating to all the btc development team and side projects like LN, if btc was the reason you made all of this it would be fair to make the thing even more great.

Coinbase is not batching txs (extremely critical for an exchange, it should be a MUST) and not using segwit, of course they don't care for their users.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:17
This is one of the reason fees go extremely high in short times, exchanges and many wallets are extremely poor at estimating confirmation times, as it makes no sense to pay 1000 sat/b right now when 200 sat/b is enough. 
Even though it's a bit cumbersome I recommend the community to check the mempool and specifiy the sat/b by YOURSELF not "dynamically", we all need to contribute in all possible ways to minimize this issue while other solutions (like LN, MAST, Schnorr, and block size increase) are implemented.

You're correct, is he's behind a NAT there's nothing to do but ask for change, but I doubt providers are using that for IPv6 addresses.
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:42:55
RemindMe! 5 years
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:47:22
From what I understand, you don't need to port forward IPv6 address as your router will give each of your devices a public address (IPv4 used ports forwarding since there's a shortage of Ips)
So you should just run bitcoin node, add a rule on the firewall for the OS you're running it and that's all, it should work.
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:58:34
Can't recommend this guide enough
@_date: 2019-03-08 19:06:06
You're correct, I actually meant port forwarding, as the router will assign a public ipv6 to each device so there's no need for that.
And agreed with the 2nd point too, but that just applies to some routers (didn't need to on my commercial tp link ones)

I agree, back in the days one would just pay 10c and it would be confirmed in next block. Sadly segwit is not enough and core doesn't want to upgrade blocksize, so one needs to use workarounds like this one until the scale issue is fixed.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:50:47
Turn down for what
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:58:29
The fabricant is trezor but the resellers are many not related to them, that's why it says trezor.
Also trezor just want to increment their sales, that's why they link to amazon, there should be a notice saying that amazon sellers are not related to them, I agree.
However since you're investing your money here, it's better to pay some extra $ and purchase directly from them.

As you can see, only 200+ sat/byte are clearing now, but a few hours ago it went low enough to confirm all TXS at 20+ sat/byte.
Just see the last 4 drops in the graph (those are blocks) and notice until which color they are reaching down, from there you can be safe and take a color above that one, if the network doesn't suddenly get a lot of TXS, your will confirm most likely.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:38:24
Yes, sadly the developed of this site has a default for "Segwit2x" however it doesn't exists, so it's the same as clicking core.
To your other question, one is showing you the COUNT of the transactions in the mempool (around 30k at this time) and the other is showing you the FEES paid for those transactions in the mempool (almost 10 BTC in fees for all the transactions that haven't confirmed), the last one is showing you the size in terms of kilobyte. To be honest, with only the first graph you can know which fee is adequate, the other graphs aren't as relevant.

[This should clear your doubts](
The drops are inside those blue circles, basically when the total drops (example 35k unconfirmed transactions to 33k) it means a block has been found and that's why the mempool lower in quantity.
By that we can see the last range that has been fully cleared in those blocks is the color purple (220-240 sat/byte), so if you want your tx to confirm in the next block without overpaying, using the next range (green 240-260 sat/byte) should be enough.
However early this day, anything above 20 sat/byte was enough to get a fast confirmation, and this happens on a daily basis, there are some hours that mempool is very full, and another that's almost empty, hence the importance of checking, as you can get a fast confirmation when mempool is low by just paying around 10-20c.

If that was the case then it's his fault for not checking.
What I got from this post is that he pasted it and electrum client showed the "right" address, but when he clicked sent it was changed behind the scenes, which malware probably can do that.
Using hardware wallet grants you sign only the address you want to send, whatever the client displays in the screen (which could be an spoof and the real one is not displayed)
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:06:37
Please use a hardware wallet for future times, it shows the address in the device, and if it doesn't match the one you actually want to send you just cancel it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:34:16
No, you didn't read it right. You should confirm the address in the source, not in the electrum client (ie: his friend chat)
