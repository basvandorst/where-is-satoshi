possibly montana or new mexico.. you could probably form an LLC in one of those jurisdictions, or maybe if you know someone who'd let you pay one of their bills :p
check the states in which paypal isn't licensed as a 'money transmitter' or similar  - if paypal isn't then kraken (or anyone else transmitting money) doesn't need to be either.. of course they may still need to licensed as something else - so it's not entirely clear :p
At a glance, Wisconsin and Utah also seem like good candidates.. New Mexico, South Carolina aren't listed - so I guess paypal has no licenses there at all, and in Montana they're licensed as an Escrow Agent (nothing to do with money transmission really). You'd probably need to read the actual acts these licenses refer to in order to make sure.. I'm really not sure about the 'check cashing/sale of cheques' licensed states - some of them might be ok.
Also found this site.. seems like these are the only clear cut ones;
I guess anyone can open a basic LLC in South Carolina, New Mexico or Montana, register with Fincen (still need to deal with the feds), get a dwolla account and setup an exchange - as long as you only accept customers from SC,NM,MO you should be totally legal.

their application form has a Country field, but you can't change it from Germany to anything else.. looks like they're planning too but haven't enabled it yet.. here's a different german bank that allows foreign applicants;
