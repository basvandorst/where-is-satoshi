hope it goes to 0 then i will by all coins for 0. where did i miss logic here?

Ok so fees of a tx also help any previous  unconfirmed transactions get through, did I understand that correctly? I just saw that the latest tx depended on the output of the previous tx and I just thought that would be impossible to resolve. It's nice knowing that bitcoin resolves such issues intelligently if i understood you correctly.
edit: ok just read it's the miners who would do " CPFP (child pays for parent)" in their own interest. ok gogogo :D

thank you. sold all my lifesavings in btc because of you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:04:20

ok great to hear, learning more each day :D

currencies are not stocks. value is measured in adoption. it, by definition, has the value the users give it. not. like. stocks.

yeah those btc all go to an exchange where i need to sell some BTC over a period because next wage i get is in 2 months and i don't want to risk my bank closing my account :D ok i will hope for the best :D just 1 last question: will a 1500 sat/fee help much if it gets critical for me (as a last resort)? do enough nodes support CPFP for it to all get confirmed in a fast fashion if i choose that high a fee?

bitcoin will die and all crypto currencies with it. we're going back to fiat people. because all that talk about troubles in the financial system for years and years is just that, right?
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:35:03
i use a bank that specialises in working together with a bitcoin exchange. i don't have these worries :D
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:39:36
yeah so all bitcoins on earth would be worth 21 million (10 million if you count lost and non mined coins) if bitcoin was $1. that means hardly everyone would be using it.

k thx for your help and for instilling confidence in me. was really getting worried haha like with everything in my life basically .D
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:42:36
OK i think i get it. the part I do not spend gets rerouted back to me, and it is waiting for that part from the first transaction, before it can be used on the second transaction, right? How do i go about solving this? Will using a transaction accelerator for the first transaction help??

imagine being at the peek of your wealth and then losing half of its worth in a few weeks. applies to lots of btc users not just winklevoss
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:36:11

If you know the technology you don't look at price. Every serious investor is like that.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:17:35
seems to me like after every dip there should be more hodlers because only sellers sell.
but no! dips still happen. so must be manipulated to some extent.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:12:40
No i mean if account goes too much into the minus then it would close my account. So i have to gradually sell some of my btc.  nothing to do with that fact you just commented on. edit: german bank that works together with the only german bitcoin exchange bitcoin.de :) (bank:
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:41:06

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:47:51
i always do that but keep running out of money
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:18:58
if bitcoin drops to zero i'm buying all! 0 times 21000000 = 0
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:37:37
I hodl because I hate working for money. Giving time of your life for money just seems like a shitty deal because you live only once.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:13:53
yep ty again^^
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:41

@_date: 2018-02-07 21:21:44
I always do that but somehow it doesn't work. I always need more money
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:09:01
if i didnt have to cash out til i get my next fiat in 2 months i wouldnt give a F.. if bitcoin crashed to 1000$ because i wouldnt need the money. so please, BTC, hold strong for 2 months pls
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:25:24
bitcoin has tought me that markets are 100% psychology. you can have the best product. but doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:56:01

hopefully we get some media support again when jounalists write "bitcoin over 10k again". that would be nice.
