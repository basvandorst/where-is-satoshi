A few points of feedback:
- The headline is "so what exactly is bitcoin?" - why do you wait until after 4 bullet points to give your 'rough definition'? "What is bitcoin" should be the first thing on it, and it should be authoritative, not what comes off as a wishy-washy personal opinion.
- "Is it a wise or foolish investment to own but not use bitcoin" shouldn't be on this at all because it's an incredibly specific minor argument to hash out on a generally-informative flyer, and at the very least it shouldn't come *before* you've even explained what bitcoin is. At this point, your reader doesn't even know what bitcoin is, but you're already talking about whether or not you want to "hold it", as if that means anything to them.
- "What can it do for me" shouldn't be there either, or at least it should be a serious bullet rather than a weird plug for yourself. It should also come after you explained what the hell Bitcoin is.
- Actually, every single thing on the page before the actual explanation of what bitcoin is should be moved below it.
- "Could I ever lose money with it?" "no" - you just completely lost the interest of every single person who's heard about any of the thousands of people who've lost money with Bitcoin. Why the overt lies?
- Remove all the rambling "I'm no economist", "I believe bitcoin will be $10000 before it's $100 again", "this is my opinion...", "don't get the impression that I work for Bitcoin" type shit. No one cares about your opinion. No one reading this even knows who you are. Present the facts and let them speak for themselves, don't inject your own take. You could remove probably 80-85% of the text on this page without losing any actual information.
- Completely re-do the layout. Why is there a bullet point at the very start? Why are there random tabs in the middle of paragraphs? Why the crazy font sizes? It looks like you threw everything around completely haphazardly.

Thank you for giving me an incredibly perfect example of what I just posted about.

No one is saying that. People keep giving examples of its contentiousness, and you keep replying by saying "it's contentious because it's contentious" like that means anything. The fact that people are arguing over it and that it's controversial means *exactly* that it's contentious. Christ.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:28:25
Yep. Half the posts in this thread smack of "it's just too amazing and revolutionary". That type of nauseating autofellatio and the Bitcoin community generally are the reasons people hate it.

I am 100 percent sure that zero people ever have been paid to hate on Bitcoin on the internet, and it is endlessly hilarious to watch this sub circle jerk about how "obvious" it is.

Of all the dumb conspiracies, the "they're just *paid* shills" one is definitely the dumbest.

I don't buy that Bitcoin offers anything not available already here, sorry. If you can give me a specific example that might help.
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:04:59
Do you think every troll on the internet is being paid by someone? Because there are plenty of communities that garner way more hatred than Bitcoin, but they don't all have goofball conspiracy theories about people being paid to do so.


is a troll's wet dream. This subreddit feeds them *constantly*, and gives them new material all the time. Case in point: posts theorizing that because people hate on Bitcoin, they must be paid to do so.
People are going to troll this place as long as it's fun for them. There's no mystery to it.

That is exactly what the person you're replying to is saying, so thanks for agreeing with him after this retarded 10-deep derail, I guess.

It is definitely speculation, but it's not a catalyst for intelligent discussion because there's nothing intelligent about your speculation. Your premise is valueless. It'd be like if you walked up to a bunch of mechanical engineers with your great idea for a perpetual motion machine. The discussion ends at "not possible, you don't understand the topic." If you want intelligent discussion, don't base it on a profoundly unintelligent premise.

My favorite posts here are the ones that smugly assert it's been "proved" that a bunch of people are paid trolls.
Proved by who? A bunch of people who agree it's been proved? 
There exists literally no evidence whatsoever to support your view.

And with Bitcoin you can just take the money and run since there's no way to reverse it!

Even if that were the case (it isn't), your brand is still toxic. Either you've been co-opted by assholes who hate women for some reason, or that's the narrative people are believing, but you can't save the tag at this point. Ditch it and move on to something that can be associated with ethics in journalism - if that's what you really care about - without the insane amount of baggage you're carrying.

By that logic, nothing is the first iteration of anything. SMTP grew out of message-passing standards on ARPANET in the 70s, ARPANET grew out of fledging ideas for packet-switching networks, etc.
By most sane definitions, SMTP was "the first cut".
Also, ouch on that TCP/IP comment.

This thread is about a pretty specific claim, that Bitcoin allows you to pay in the future without trusting someone else. I disagreed with that, and what I'm hearing from you now is that I was right. We can talk about all the other stuff you threw in in this post some other time.

As a software engineer, I personally don't like PHP. However, there's nothing about it that's inherently "unprofessional" or "for amateurs", and this post is pretty ridiculous. You sound like you don't really know anything about programming.

I mentioned this in another reply, but no, larger transactions sometimes warrant additional security. For instance, I can't withdraw more than $500 a day from an ATM. Up to that amount just requires my card and PIN. Nearly every financial institution on the planet has similar types of protection.


If someone had seized control of your bank account and paypal information (for example, if you saved passwords to both on your laptop and it was stolen), you'd want this type of protection in place so the thief couldn't drain you.
Even if your response is "well I'm more careful than that", there are a lot of people out there who aren't. Everyone probably should be really careful, but it's still good that companies put in protective measures for that type of situation.

It's "lo and behold".
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:37:55


He can. He just had to prove that he was who he said he was. That is the appropriate place for this type of security measure. Do you seriously not understand why large withdrawals from an account warrant additional security?


I guess you'd better tell that to basically every payment processor on the planet, including those that let you sell BTC for USD. 
For that matter, haven't some BTC exchanges been *notoriously* awful about requiring months and months of verification steps and other bullshit before allowing you to cash out?
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:45:05


Curious, if you had a dozen other ways that you knew would work, why'd you choose Paypal to begin with?

I've never had a single issue with PayPal.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:17:52


You're saying that no place should be allowed to store more money than you can withdraw in one go without any additional security measures? That if you have $25m in the bank you should just be able to withdraw it all at an ATM at once?

Without a public forum to view such complaints/removals/etc this probably feels totally inadequate to there people concerned about censorship (I don't care what you remove or why, for the record).

How, if at all, has this thread and the replies to it affected your perception of the Bitcoin community?
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:56:34
Does Bitcoin have the concept of "authorization"? (Not sure if that's the right word) - like, the reason I can buy a thing with my credit card even though the charge doesn't clear instantly is because my cc  company says "this guy's good for the money". What could Bitcoin do to have similar functionality if it's not processing transactions in real time? 
I think the important point is not " how long does it take for the transaction to clear " but "can the system keep up with the rate of purchasing". It's not important that my cc (or Bitcoin account) takes days to clear, it's important that in the time it takes to clear all the new transactions made aren't even further behind. I'm not convinced that isn't a problem for Bitcoin.
