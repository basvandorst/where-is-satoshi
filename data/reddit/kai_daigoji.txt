Which is why I pay (in interest) for protection.  I think bitcoin insurance would be awesome, but probably hard to implement.

You want to convince your wife that Bitcoin is so awesome it's worth investing in.
Let's try this - Bitcoin is a currency.  If it's so awesome, why are you treating it like a commodity instead of a currency?

No, it's not, because he has no 'inside knowledge' on Bitcoin.  He has the same info everybody else has, and the market has taken that info and decided that Bitcoin was overvalued.

It's a store of wealth that has lost 50% of it's value overnight on multiple occasions.  Unless you're predicting Weimar-like hyperinflation, the dollar is better.  And if you are predicting Weimar-like hyperinflation...there's no help for you.

Nobody's **required** to use banks now.  I don't know what you're going on about.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:35:20
Okay - so if I give you $100, then you've seen an increase in your purchasing power.  That's good, from your perspective.
If I give $100 to every individual in the economy, they will all see it as good.  But will that be good for the economy as a whole?

Because the expected returns are less than the utility of having liquidity?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:50:34
This would absolutely be possible with bitcoin.  You realize that there's no reason a bank couldn't exist with bitcoin accounts, right?  And that if you used said bank's services, they might charge you fees?

Here's what's fascinating to me about this post, and the discussion in this entire thread.  The way it's written, the comments people are making, are all talking about bitcoin as a commodity, not a currency.  Which is honestly what it is - it's a commodity that can be transfered pretty easily and anonymously.

Because these 'knowledgeable people' have been saying this for five years, that double digit inflation is just over the horizon.  Until I see some actual evidence, I will continue to ignore them.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:18:36


And yet if everyone saves, it turns out that hurts the economy a lot.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:21:51


Economists don't think that inflation is good as a matter of dogma or faith.  Rather, they believe that certain levels of inflation can be good in specific circumstances because of mathematical models, arguments, and evidence going back half a century or more.
And you have a belief, equally certain, that inflation == bad.  What do you base it on?  If you have models, arguments, or evidence, by all means, share it.  Even if the arguments are bad, we can talk about them  - that's how science moves forward.
But if you don't, then that right there is why doesn't take bitcoin seriously.  Not because you've stumbled across some deeper truth that they're too orthodox to acknowledge, but because you're actually not saying anything as profound as you think you are.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:52:31


It isn't.  There's been almost no inflation over the last 5 years.  The dollar's value is absolutely steady.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:18:47
I'm just saying, if Bitcoin ever becomes a viable currency, there will be banking that charges fees.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:53:38
Which defeats the point of using Bitcoin as a currency, doesn't it?
Also, Bitcoin is fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:47:21
That's a different conversation.  I'm just pointing out that the claim that wait staff make less than minimum wage is false.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:25:20
I think you vastly overestimate how different Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:23:41


Okay, but why do you disagree?  What evidence are you disagreeing on the basis of?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:22:50
Any other currency.  Paper money is anonymous, fungible, has a low transaction cost, etc.  Bitcoin is better for electronic transfers, maybe.  And don't fool yourself, it can be seized.
How is Bitcoin so different that it will spark a revolution?
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:50:14
No, you're not.  If their tips don't cover the difference, the owners are legally required to make up the difference.  They make minimum wage.  The fact that that minimum wage sucks compared to Europe is a whole nother coversation.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:11:11


So no, no evidence.


You realize there are other possibilities than planned economies, right?  That a capitalist economy can exist, and yet not all actions that benefit the individual will benefit the whole?
