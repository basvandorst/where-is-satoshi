Ethereum was made on Bitcoin tho.....
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:25:25
Ethereum was already made for that.

Take your time. Read about Bitcoin and how it works. When you will feel comfortable enough, store it in a ledger.

Why would the government waste 17bn on attack that nobody cares about? Attacking Bitcoin won't bring them votes.

If our ancestors wore titanium to display status, we would use titanium. Gold was lucky to be the chosen one.
Yes, things become valuable when people of a certain status wear them. Look at Gucci they sell crap for a fuck ton of money and the only reason why they can do it is that some people are willing to pay for them. If no one paid for them there would be no Gucci.

I pay my VPN subscription with Bitcoin, I order shit from Amazon with Bitcoin and there's a cafe is Montreal that accepts Bitcoin as payment.
There are multiple online store (Microsoft) that accept Bitcoin as a mean of payment.
It's not because you don't look for options that they don't exist.
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:07:20
Probably not except if you actively try to look it.

Everyone that got in Bitconnect early made profit does that mean that Bitconnect was a great investment? Not really.
The mainstream public can't tell the difference so if you say shit like that, you make it sound like some ez money scheme.

They are clearly less effective than Bitcoin. To use gold regularly as a currency, you would have to carry a balance and a knife to cut the exact amount of gold. 
The solution to that problem would be to give your gold to a bank that would issues bank notes but we all know that you can't trust banks to do nothing with your gold.
Bitcoin is simply more effective. Gold cannot work today.

This is a meaningless post.
The only thing you can learn from this is that you should have bought Bitcoin. It says nothing that can convince someone to buy Bitcoin.
Fuck this post.

Most vpns accept payment in Bitcoin and as long as you don't use your computer on your home wifi, you should be good.

You have to understand that most people like smartphones but only a fraction of these people care about how it works. Same for Bitcoin. Some people simply doesn't give a shit and you can't force them to. If these people are your family, they should try to at least understand your point of view.  If they don't want to listen to you, you shouldn't have to listen to them.

Somewhere in the article the author makes the point that if countries can't stop drug trafficking, how can they stop a virtual anonymous and weightless cryptocurrency.

It's hard to get a VPN but once you have one and you use it on public locations, they might know that someone is using but they can't pinpoint who. I don't claim that it's easy but it's feasible.
The point of the VPN is for the government to not know what you are doing so that they don't come at you to take your possession.

Ethereum is equaly as value as Bitcoin because of the program built into it. It's just not in the same league as BTC. BTC is future money and Ethereum is the next biggest developper tool out there.

You always have the choice to go live on an island in the middle of the ocean. Nobody will tax you there. You have the liberty to live a life free of taxation. If you don't take that opportunity then it means that you are willing to give 30% of your income to the government.

The last new thing in Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash itself and it is a a pale copy of BTC. Might as well use Doge Coin.

Gold wasn't nearly as practical for almost any transaction as bills that why they were invented. Why would you use bills if they are less practical than Bitcoin.
Doesn't make sense to me.

Ethereum has no real usage it's more an experiment to show what is possible with cryptocurrencies (smart contract)

If you want a legit betting site that accept Bitcoin you can still use Microbet. They also accept LN payment. There are some risks but I've use it and it works just fine.
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:49:41


That is bs. There's nothing that doesn't change in price.
When gold was 1st used as a store of value, was it stable? If it wasn't then how can it be used as a store of value in the 1st place and if it wasn't stable how did it become instantly stable?
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:11:53
Way more useful that commenting "BITCOIN" on r/AskReddit
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:41:23
Bitcoin is 10 y/o. You can't expect stability after 10 y/o it might have took gold decades to reach any form of "stability".
I was just responding to your ridiculous statement that gold price doesn't fluctuate it does but the market cap is WAYYYY higher than Bitcoin's. You are comparing a todler to a an extremely experienced athlete.

France as an institution is still exploiting Africa. I agree with you that most French aren't aware of the damage done but their ignorance doesn't make them less responsible because they still benefit from these ressources.

No, the network is a separate entity. The USD is nothing without a network. Bitcoin without a network still has information (the blockchain) that has value.
The network interacts with the blockchain but it isn't the coin. Bitcoin without anybody is still Bitcoin because it has its own unique blockchain. That's the difference between Dogecoin and Bitcoin. If they all shared the same Blockchain you could use any coin interchangeably including Bitcoin. Bitcoin would just be a coin in a sea of shitty replicable altcoins.
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:45:00
Bitcoin is backed by its Blockchain. You can create another cryptocurrency identical to Bitcoin but you can't recreates it's blockchain. Since the Blockchain is a distributed ledger and that information has value. 
Here's an example. The Beauty and the Beast isn't a physical book. It's a story written in a book. The story itself is information and that information can be stored on a physical object but the story itself doesn't need a physical ledger to exist and that story has value. I don't know how much but the fact it's still known means that it is something.
