Hey guys, I'm from over at Just had my first experience with bitcoin over this past week and learned a lot from you guys about how it works. I filing away my bits so I can get a game hopefully during this digital sale they have going on. I've been waiting for Shadow of Mordor, it looks awesome! So far my favorite Xbox game this year has been Geometry Wars 3. I honestly didn't know how they would make a 3rd game when the first two were so great.

Such an exciting time to be bitcoining!!
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:33:07
oh man I got you, I just figured this out a few minutes ago. You need to find out what your wallet code is(should be on the circle account page) then use change tip to send money to your circle account wallet. Use the send money link on the "My Money" page

Thank you! I definitely appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:13:09

I had just transferred some bits into my account and it went down, glad I'm not the only one having problems.
@_date: 2015-01-01 06:27:33
Lol awesome! Happy New Year!

I just try to explain it the best I can and spread the word out to my friends. Just last night I was explaining to my fiancé about Bitcoin mining and the rise and fall in prices. I can't wait til more places accept it as basic payment. It's just so secure and easy it blows mind.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:29:12
Oh man, thank you so much! More bits to the bank!! 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:30:26
Thank you!! It's exciting to see the bits add up, currently sitting at .09 BTC! 
@_date: 2015-01-01 05:52:14
Oh man I was there!! Happy new year!!
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:35:14
I haven't been into this for long but that's my ultimate goal, to have 1 full Bitcoin. I've been putting small amounts of money every paycheck towards buying small amounts of Bitcoin. I agree this low price is definitely attractive to new buyers like me. I think it's a very exciting time to get into it! 
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:21:29
Thank you very much! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:50:23
The worst part: I made a small buy this past Friday and it is taking until next Friday to get my bits. It's rough just watching their value drop. No biggie though, It was never my intention to sell anytime soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:11:35
Well hello, sirs! Hope everyone's having a good day. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:34:11
I haven't come anywhere close to having the BTC to top it off, but I've definitely used bitcoin to buy Microsoft credit. It was a super easy payment system, but then again it seems like every bitcoin transaction is buttery smooth
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:52:00
I am absolutely not a codecracker, I found this out by sitting here for 15 minutes and having no idea how to solve this. Congrats to whoever does!
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:36:43
Hey, welcome to the sub! I'm pretty new here also, but it's a good place to discuss and keep a positive word about bitcoin and ther's a ton of very knowledgable people around. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:09:50
Whew, just came back up. Everything is as it should be.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:34:23
Lol, definitely not. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:00:09
I just recently got into the bitcoin scene and personally I feel like it's in a good place to scoop some up before it takes off again. More places recognize it as payment than ever before. I think it's a good time to get into bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:41:30
Happy New Years!! I hope the price goes up to 10k! :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:05:37
I know, with all this news lately thats exactly where my thoughts went
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:13:01
I agree!! Bitpay and the bitcoinbowl were a lot of fun and drove some great awareness to cryptocurrency. Anything we can do to drive awareness is a good thing!
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:06:33
Oh my.... THIS INCREDIBLE POWER!! CRIPPLING MICROSTRANSFERS!
