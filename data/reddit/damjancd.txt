Strangely that's also how you recognise a guy with arrows in his back...... Not trying to make a point... Just that, that's their visible trait.

I'm trying to read through this, but I seem to be mentally challenged. Could someone Eli5 or even, dare I say Eli12 this for me? Thank you.
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:40:59
Not me, but it's retarded to expect that no nonretarded fella wouldn't. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:16:24
It was like that in the paper :)

Did he really deserve to be called an idiot? Is it that easy to determine it's a fake account? 
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:20:03
It absolutely feeds me, the ferocity of the opposition to bitcoin. It means it's stirring up a lot of bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 04:56:49
It will be indecently exhilarating when governments stop using physical money and exchange it for bitCoin like cryptocurrencies.
Physical and centrally controlled money would soon become infeasible and a logistical nightmare to perpetuate.
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:33:56
what's the easiest and safest wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:04:54
well he WAS the president and founder of bitcompany which is known as the founder of bitcoin.
Hey, this coming up with bullshit is fun.
@_date: 2014-11-17 11:21:03
For a moment, I thought it was r/worldnews and I saw I well upvoted bitcoin comment. Oh well.
@_date: 2014-12-02 05:54:50
So.. I'm a bit new and or stupid, was blockchain part of bitcoin since the very beginnings? 
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:22:46
Some of them are realistic. It's a great TV series, Brooker nails it well there. 
It has the inspiration to "Her" 2014 as an episode. 
I quite liked most of them, even the unrealistic ones. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:41:49
Thanks for pointing that out. I'm slowly pulling myself from the mud :)
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:15:31
Can't you manipulate purchases like that. Show that you've paid, not connect to the net and delete the app before connecting. 
I didn't know about the sync with wifi of firechat. thanks
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:16:09
I love this subreddit!
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:32:31
If it's worthless and pathetic, why lobby for it's downfall? Isn't it already done?
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:54:55
is this  a different way to say just write down the numbers on a piece of paper?
@_date: 2014-12-31 08:30:54
Isn't that impossible since you'd need a connection to a wider net? Mesh networks can only maybe set up a temporary local currency, and one that is quite unreliable probably.
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:08:34
hahaha thanks u/NiceGuyLuke 
You didn't have to lure me into bitCoin though. Been loving the concept since I wrapped my head around it. I think it's pretty much the most elegant and non-violently efficient way to restructure one of the most essential, if not THE most essential elements of humanity. 
Still thanks :)
EDIT: OH dogecoin :) my bad. Still the same underlying concept :)
@_date: 2014-12-03 00:58:26
Jesus fucking christ how elegant. And how fucking inspiring. A few of the right people, getting together, chatting, working something out, letting it spill throughout the world. From then on, no coming back. It's part of society, and there's no stopping it. 
But the way how the system is employed to work and keep it's efficiency through the "rewards" as you say. 
I may have not seen a more subtly revolutionary thing in recent time, maybe even my life.
Glad to be still around. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:26:43
stop downvoting bots. They've got enough shit to worry about.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:24:47
You are downvoted again. Why? If we take part of the dispute in the discussions, the issue will be more directly looked at, and increase chances that a fix to it will stick. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:50:39
If they ask themselves this question, I don't think Chinese gov. official will be ok with them coexisting. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 08:00:46
Yeah Im backing on out on this. Just made a comment about capitalism that wasn't immediately downvoted over there. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:37:33
Does this happen automatically? preScheduled? 
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:41:17
halving as in the price will drop in half?
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:47:03
Cool, thanks :)
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:28:10
That, as far as I know, was the same way Ron Paul played it when he disagreed with others. 
If you are a libertarian, then you go full on liberty even about issues that really REALLY bother you. You can't pick and chose the ones that you are personally not ok with. Even on a federal level, it's still some other people deciding for you what you can do with your body and your things.

Worst case scenario would be? Slower transfers temporarily?
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:41:34
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:07:10
By definition it could be flowers and puppies for all. In practice, consistently, everywhere where it has been tried, the same things. Death, poverty, concentration camps. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:31:43
Basic sanitation is not panacea.
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:29:51
It's probably worded badly. They just want to weed out the communists from the start. Which is a nice thing.
@_date: 2015-04-22 04:16:45
More of a socialist trauma, but thankfully not direct. Through my grandparents, and the brainwashing of millions of children and through sending uncountable people to work, political or re-education camps.
@_date: 2015-04-21 04:50:06
Quite the joke. Any communist affiliations? 
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:33:07
Thank you kindly
@_date: 2015-04-07 01:05:29
Any link for that white paper?
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:57:10
Because poverty, death, concentration camps, systematic killing of political prisoners, brain washing, destruction of property... just a few of the top of my shaven head.
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:05:09
If they existed, sure, we could've said that. 
Death, poverty, concentration camps is not "organised in the collective and some rules". But human individual life for you guys is expendable so I guess that's where that comes from.
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:30:35
Just people having guns works well. Everyone having guns beats machete any time.

Time to cash out the loot huh USMS?
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:19:15
What prevents another mt.gox this time? The people having experience of such things? A bigger market for exchanges? Programming of the blockchain that's updated? 
Seriously asking :)
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:25:39
So a bigger market of exchanges. Cool. I love it that as it gets bigger, it gets more stable and safe.
@_date: 2015-02-01 12:55:11
Would love to see Greece do to BRIC what they did to EU.

Selling the loot

Wow I'm using this fucker as often as possible from now on... Thanks @_date: 2015-02-05 10:43:51
why is it horrible? I've heard people pronounce it actually, when I think about it.
