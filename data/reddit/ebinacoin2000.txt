I’m always inclined to buy when the prices is high and sell in a panic, as a result I’ve lost 50% of my investment, am I just a loser?!

But it’s all good and well to HODL but I bought at 19100  so taking on real losses instead of reduced profits, graph is following a downward  trajectory each day, so the real question is how much are you willing to lose???

I am a super loser, I would have got more pleasure watch my physical money burn than seeing it disappear in green and red squares, but hey you live and learn...

I have to confess, I got into bitcoin last March and put small sums in as the price went from $1000 to $3000, I was having all kinds of problems at work, and was following the rule only invest what you could afford to lose. 
By November, it was clear that I was going to be made redundant from my job, I was due a pay out for the decades of service, just before Christmas I started investing larger amounts into bitcoin, I was kicking myself for not starting earlier, my goal was to acquire a few coins, yes I was a newbie speculator, jumping on the gravy train. Nobody expect bitcoin to get so fast up to $10k, and within 2 weeks of that milestone it was at $15k, people were saying by the end of the year it it would be be worth 30k. So I allowed myself to dream, to get greedy. 
I was even planning to sink my big fat redundancy check into the exchange hope that I might be in a position in 2018 to buy my own home (mortgage free). I guess I should be grateful that the price started correcting itself just before the Christmas  weekend, i didn’t have a chance to transfer any more money. 
With what I had, I hodled, when it went down to 17k I tried to buy back on the dip but I’m not a smart bot so I lost coins, at 13k I was still hodling, chart had been trending down but I still believed a bottom would be found. 
Since I wasn’t working, I could watch the exchange all day, it quickly became apparent that I need to watch it all night too. It went down to 10k and people were saying it won’t go below, but it dipped below. It was under there for what felt like an eternity, came back up again, and I converted some of my holding fiat, it was going up, at this point I just wanted to recover some of the new year’s losses. 
Then it dipped back below to 9k then 8k then 7k. I am all for the hodl revolution, and I wish I could be as brave as some of the people on here, my feeling is this, I am not hodling a loss in profit, but one of capital. I couldn’t justify to myself losing my own money, it’s just crazy; this weekend I lost $1k just from a price move of €7489 to €6905. In the real world if I lost that kind of money,  I would be visibly upset, I’d probably cry but you know the first thing I was thinking was “how can I make it back” “how do I gain on a down” that when I knew I had to go, cut my losses and depart from the exchange. 
And i have to confess this is the first bit of peace of mind I’ve had since December, I spent the afternoon looking for a job. Yes, I am a loser, and really rubbish at the bitcoin game but I was big enough to know my own limits, it has been a learning curve, and i don’t write this to serve any agenda, just want to share my experience, so I can begin to heal.

Some of that money was mine :-(

I invested $12k total and quit when I had $4K, which was today.
