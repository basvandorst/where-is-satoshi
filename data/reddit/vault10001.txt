Well, at least we don't have a school shooting every day. Haven't had one since 1961 in fact.

It's true that we count rapes more than other countries, while America would count a father raping a daughter for one year as "rape", sweden would count it 500 rapes. We also have a much broader definition of what's called rape. 
Yes, there are no-go zones in Sweden. Not that America doesn't have that either ("Detroit"), or any other country for that fact. The only difference is that we map out those areas.. I don't get why you think Sweden have many Africans.. There's barely any here, but we do have a lot of Muslims and Asians.
Also, Americans doesn't have Freedom, your government is controlled by companies that pays lobbyist (which is bribes, and should be illegal). Just last month it showed clearly what kind of Democracy you have. 5 Old capitalists voting for whether the Internet should be open or closed? Where three of them had been paid in millions. That doesn't really sound like democracy to me.
Also, Sweden haven't had a school shooting since 1961. I'd much rather have guns banned than having a school shooting every day. (We recently had a right-extremist cutting down immigrants with a sword, but no other school accidents for years)

Hilarious, some people are easily brainwashed, thinking two news defines what's happening in a country long-term everywhere. Sure, some idiots will set cars on fire sometimes. But at least we don't have school shootings every fucking week.
