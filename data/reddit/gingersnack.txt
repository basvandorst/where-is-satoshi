The dude is a pioneer, putting himself in cold storage. ;)

So what?
All the reporters and news sites in the universe can say there is a discount, but if the site itself does not give one, it's not there.
I'm on the site and it's not giving me a discount.

Nah, a lot of things are just bad right out of the gate and no amount of fixing will make them work. Like government fiat currency, bad idea that just can't be fixed so we're trying to replace it.
Scepticism of new inventions is good on the whole.

I had an idea for "standardized virtual currency" back in 2011. Basically, a currency that could be easily interchangeable with other currencies and stored online. But i knew no idea was truly original so i googled "virtual currency" and found bitcoin. When i read about the blockchain i knew this was it, THIS was answer that made virtual currency *work*. I was also pissed off i didn't come up with the blockchain myself, i pushed my pride down and proceeded to get into bitcoin.
That said, getting bitcoins was such an unimaginable hassle that i went with just mining it. I bought computer hardware and I joined slush's pool and deepbit and proceeded to acquire ~200 coins that way.
When mining became unprofitable (for me) in late 2011, i proceeded to day trade my 200 coins. I've made good calls and lots of tremendously bad ones. In total i was able to grow that 200 to 1000+ and i'm still doing it today.
One of my biggest blunders was selling 600 coins at $3 to buy precious metals. I never should have done that. I keep the bars beside me as a constant reminder of my stupidity and constant encouragement to keep trading.

Have companies like coinsetter been hit? this might really screw up the ecosystem if it turns out to be further reaching.

Yeah i'm wondering if it's too good to be true. I know newegg has a decent profit margin, but 150 off from 500 would mean some items would have to be sold at cost, for a few items it would be a VERY steep cost. 
Unless newegg is counting on the hype being very big but the number of bitcoin users actually buying very small.
I haven't found a way to invoke the discount either, so i wonder if the reporter for newsbtc.com simply made a mistake.

Yeah i've been wondering this too. I've been trying to order something but it keeps charging me regular price.

The site itself still isn't giving a discount, so their press release, for now, is no different than a lie or a mistake. 
Until someone actually confirms it's being applied to their order, i'm still calling BS on the "discount".

I'll believe it when someone actually tests the service and posts their results. Until then it's vaporware.
