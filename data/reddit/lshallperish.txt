Don't hate bitcoin myself if it had stable growth but how does a 200b plus coin gain 20% when alts coins can't even get that lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:18:47
This is the period when you sell when people dont want 15k-20k but asking for 100k lmao
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:46
When the crash starts most of you are going to get rekt so badly it's gonna be funny because you'll soon realize that it takes hours upon hours to clear funds using btc by then the crash will take full force and you'll sell for peanuts 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:14:50
Is that why only 0.1% are in bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:41
And eth had the highest transactions done day to day in the entire market which still takes minutes for funds to appear.. this means bitcoin technology is rubbish
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:06:36
It's much bigger than a exchange. Bitcoin just wasn't meant for this sort of high volume transactions to take place. It's tech is old and no major upgrades have been done on it to improve it. It's value is not from tech its known for being the father of crypto and sheep (people) don't invest in for the tech, only for the money but the real money comes from real life use and that is when you'll see bigger gains then btc
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:08
That's not a issue.. expect hours for transaction to happen.. that's bitcoin for you 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:03:36
Idk but I was reading that millions of dollars in btc are stuck for hours. Btc is digital gold. High fees and slow transactions is something no one in real life will bother with. There are coins out there that have people working on solely to improve transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:37:16
But out of hundreds of coins why bitcoin? People who buy now need bitcoin close to half a trillion in market cap just to double the investment when you can find decent coins out there that only need a billion to 2x this proves that most are sheep following the trend and not knowing about anything crypto related or just simply have no idea how to buy alts 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:10:44
Well I didn't only read I saw btcs block chain transaction times lol some were stuck for 18 hours 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:59:45
Yeah you know how many people would need to get in on btc to see a 230b plus coin go up by 20% in a day? Some Alts can't even do that.. when btc dips it dips by 1-2k but that isn't a crash that's a dip lol now a crash with panic is going to be epic.. people are not here for the tech its 100% money and gamble so loyalty for the new comers don't exist they will exit as soon as they smell the crash 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:32:49
When will it crash lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:49:05
because it has no real use case.. other coins are actually trying to change the world using crypto.. bitcoin is bitcoin and the father of crypto but put technology with it and its a joke but carry on moon kids too 10000k we go

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:54:51
Wait... you sold at 9975 but gonna buy back in at 10000? You think the crash is gonna be exactly on that figure? It's not worth being in bitcoin for another 0.5% but worth it after 10k? LMAO
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:27:07
If big buyers wand to buy than why is the exchange filled with 0.56464788743466 buys and sells.. biggest I've seen was 21 btc bought 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:18:40
You know on the 25th it was at 8100 come 29th 11500... it's down now but comon that's a lot of bag holders 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:47
That's great but eventually it'll be all about technology and bitcoin has nothing to show for it.. no real reason to use in real life, terrible speed, high fees, no staking

No way im buying bitcoin for 10k lmao.. wtf is everyone thinking? Name one asset in the entire world that has gone up and never crashed. Im not causing fud here or anything but the way things work is it goes up then down a bit and up again then down a bit.. not fucking rocketing straight up for ever. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:15
dumb money entering not knowing wtf is going on, they see the chart and see up and buy... thats about it i mean bitcoin is the god father of crypto but the technology is not as good as some other coins that are working on actual real life use. I do swing trades but i fucking sweat buckets at these levels

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:32:55
If you were actually in for the tech you wouldnt be in bitcoin.. eth and other coins are actually trying to work on blockchain tech that can be used in real life.. a slow and a high fee coin like bitcoin is driven not by tech but the actual value and word of mouth meaning dumb money is entering not even knowing what blockchain is.. send your btc somewhere, see how many hours it takes.

2. and fiat is all paper, your point?
3. It's not hackable you just dont understand much. If you buy a nano hard wallet, how can anyone hack your account if its never even touched the internet/computer? and why would they hack you and not a exchange?
4. Bitcoin is more a stock than currency. In the stock market you pay a fee to buy and sell as i said a nano is a physical thing you can carry that is your wallet.
5.Ok you buy 9000 dollars for 1 bitcoin, sell for usd then buy ruple for what ever? Just like how you exchange USD with any other currency
6. I bet you any money you're a baby boomer. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:53:54
is that so? go send your bitcoins somewhere, let me know how many hours it takes and the fee you pay.. litecoin or even eth would be better suited

Bitcoin is slow ( can take up to 20 hours to send bitcoin with high fees) bitcoin has no tech behind it nor offer anything in return (other coins are working on real life uses for block chain and offer staking aka dividends)

So people set a price they want to sell this becomes what is known as a wall because it could be 100 people setting a sell order on a even number such as 10000 so if 100 people placed sell orders of 1btc each that's a 100 BTc wall that needs to be sold before it can move up again you also need buy support to counter the people who market sell as well

Yeah same. I was making a point though. Some alts are trying to take block chain to real life problems I'm afraid there's a lot of dumb money pouring into bitcoin but as a technology it's like a steam engine train. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:08:23
Read about tether. The bull run of btc is mainly bitfinex created a problem with Wells fargo and lost support, an exchange without a banking system just can't survive, so in order to survive it had to keep people interested in their exchange so they created tether out of thin air everytime btc starts to fall and buy huge amounts of btc shooting the price back up people keep interested in then because btc is always raising this has been going for the past 7 months since they ended Wells Fargo deal

@_date: 2017-11-28 14:56:50
no im just saying you would have a better chance with a alt or even a pump and dump coin (ride the pump) than this.. i'd like to think those investing in bitcoin have a lot of money would rather not see a coin disappear tomorrow

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:39:03
it would be ok if we gained 1k every 20 or a month.. thats fine but we seem to forget that just earlier this week we were at 8500 lol

i meant when lol i know what futures are haha 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:55:04
So if bitcoin max supply is at year 2140 which means we have 16 odd million in circulation and article I red says 2-4 million bit coins are gone forever due to death, lost and forgotten (article on a popular exchange have 250million dollars of inactive users ) then we have hardcore holders and new people buying more then ever yet we don't seem to have issues with buying bitcoin still I would assume at some point the purchase of bitcoin would be hard to come by

Are you serious? Nano ledger is what everyone in crypto uses. Reead it on this forum or Google. It's a physical wallet that stores your wallet code so it never touches the computer or internet it's like a little MP3 player with a screen displaying your coins you basically access your wallet by the nano and confirm transactions with the nano YouTube how it works

Bitcoin is great but it is one of the slowest coins to transfer people have been waiting 17 hours to transfer hence why I don't believe in this global bitcoin currency.. fees are high and it's too slow for it to compete with eth or litecoin which takes 10mins and fees are in the cents. You should withdraw it from there and stick with bittrix or gdax but read up on the back logs of tens of thousands stuck in withdrawal.. you need to read up on bitcoin not from this sub because most here are emotionally invested and don't realiZe that bitcoin is old tech

Im sorry but who do you college kids come here by the thousands and buy bitcoin with 10-1000 dollars? what are you expectings going to happen? maybe one day you can buy that new computer and game all the games you ever wished? its fucking pointless.. get a job and buy the damn computer why bother with 25 dollars of bitcoin? it goes to 20k you made 50 bucks.. it goes to 40k you made 100 dollars.. why?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:13:39
Why you here then ? It's like going to watch golf even if I don't like or play it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:03
what are you on about? nothing like this is sustainable long term.. it doesn't matter if its crypto we want btc to stay at this price? then we need to build foundations on it
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:10:11
Alts will make you rich. Bitcoin being raised from tether.. bet those idiots didn't mention about tether creating fake money to boost bitcoin everytime it dips 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:43:41
what price did you buy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:12:13
7 trillion? Wtf is that in btc price lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:36:27
sorry noob question. How do you know what Sat bitcoin is at? i can only see it in terms of other coins
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:39:02
Jesus how didn't you lost your wallet infor it wouldn't have been reliable and pc crashes happen every few years for most people .you could retire now, no?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:27:49
so you think bitcoin will go up without a dip? ok lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:40:25
its like the game "pass the torch" until that torch explodes in someones hands.. or the game HOT POTATOOOOSSSSS haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:57:31
Yeah and? Takes 24-48 hours for most exchanges from crypto to fiat or 15 hours plus to transfer bitcoin. It takes days to deposit why would it take less then 6 hours to withdrawal
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:41:42
Yeah less coins on exchange = higher price, so going back to the guy that bought pizza with 10k bitcoin that guy probably had half a million or even more bitcoin you know it was a period where bitcoin was a joke it was just for fun and people gave it out for fun those people who received the coins or bought bitcoin in cents have most likely lost it all due to shiity first gen wallets and the average pc crashes every 3-4 years so there wallets are gone why would I bother backing up my wallet over a few cents would of been the logic for most 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:07:11
You should be all in or all out. I would wait for 10100 atleast this would sort of guarantee on a new leg up to 11k rather then a crash 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:40:01
Dips have signs? wow i didnt know this!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:48:00
now ask your dad what he knows about blockchain and crypto
"WHAT?? HUH?? WAIT WHAT? ITS GOING UP, RIGHT? YEAH.. OK PUT 10K SON" - Average dumb money enterer
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:15:11
When the dip comes.. im gonna expect 2-3k in 1 hit.. just a giant dildo of red this isnt healthy we should go up slowly and steady and build support along the way.. wtf is this 500+ dollars in 15mins?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:47:01
mate their americans they think america = world lol brain washed people
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:24:31
well heres a reference to what happened earlier today 16 million dollars of bitcoin was sold at the price went from 10800 to 9900.. only 16million on a almost 200 billion dollar market cap.. wtf is gonna happen if a billion is sold at one hit? lmao
