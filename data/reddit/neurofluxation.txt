It was definitely 4. Not 6.

Sorry, what is FUD?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:40:13
Do you get any "reward" for running a bitcoin node? I'm blissfully ignorant :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:43:16
Pretty sure it's a typo for "hold". Which, honestly sounds retarded... Like Dogecoins bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:35:09
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:34:54
Agreed! I've never received a tip of that amount! I got 1000 Doge once... :/

As a subscriber of and a miner and a trader - I fully understand what I'm doing. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:47:29
Your response **is** quite angry though. I like Bitcoin, Dogecoiners do as well.. It just seems that you don't like them.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:32:17
Wow. Angry much?   
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:50:44
This guy! Not only is he right, he has **cake**!

ballsyrolls.com was taken down exactly the same way about a week or 2 ago... Now there is nothing...
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:53:09
Well, seeming as you put zero effort into your question. Here's my answer:     
      
It's fine. Why wouldn't it be?
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:24:41
Except this is in the UK and it's Weed... Fuck you OP.
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:19:03
Still got pizza left? :D I'm in the UK as well!
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:28:36
Why not just join a [practice exchange]( and pretend to trade to learn it?
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:16:30
Yeah, you'll either have to:     
a) get really lucky    
b) git gud    
or c) start using the order system, place orders to sell at higher values - then wait... Yes... Wait...!
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:37:26
Sounds like you aren't being patient enough, or not using the buy/sell system properly - you can set the sell/buy price you want when you place an order. So, if you're buying too high or selling too low, it's down to the fact that you are either doing it "manually" or are just impatient :(

fucking lol    
     
Edit: Bring on the downvotes all you mac users... I'm still laughing...

It's not so much as "automatic" as it is looking for buy/sell limits. [Here's where it is on GDax]( I've not got an account, so this is all the information I can give you for there.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:47:17
is that $826 profit? or is that you would have lost $174?
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:35:58
Not sure what you're trying to say here? Macs are pretty bad for development, not as bad as Windows granted.. A \*cough* "power user" would use Linux through and through, none of this bullshit Lock-Down that OSX does. Plus "brew" support is fucking gash.

To everyone being picky about the fact that something animates and something blinks. It's a free service run by one guy out of the goodness of his heart.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:36:56
No worries, I agree.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:46:27
How come?
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:58:31
That it does!
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:58:55
Perhaps you'll end up like the guy who remembered it and had $80k waiting for him or something

I just withdrew my entire balance of 0.001600 with no fees...!
