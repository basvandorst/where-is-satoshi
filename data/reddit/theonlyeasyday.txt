But there are still a decent amount of PoW coins that are not asic resistant. Couldn't they just move down the line?
I'm trying to think of a real world example of this? And of the potential money someone could make doing this. How much do you think someone could make in a bitcoin 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:12:19
That's true...do you have an argument as to what protects bitcoin against a 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:12:29
Yeah, but that assumes only the enormously wealthy have bitcoin. What about Joe Shmo who bought it last week and now wants to spend it? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:13:09
But won't the difficulty algorithms of Bitcoin keep increasing, thus keeping up with improving hardware?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:27:38
Very nice explanation. Thanks

So what incentive would be there for them to do this? Confirm their own transaction on their own chain, undo it, and then confirm new transactions with the same bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:12:38




So you're mining a private chain? And then releasing that chain to the main chain? Would remining them just give you double block rewards?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:15:03
You're basically arguing that it's more profitable (even with 51% of the network) to play by the rules and mine then it would be to try to double spend? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:17:42
Interesting. It's basically a separate blockchain that reintegrates with the original blockchain? How secure would it be? As of now, if you really want to be secure, you should wait several blocks before considering a transaction final. Why would anyone consider a transaction secure if it was only existing on the lightening network?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:13:10
Fair point. How long could an attacker get away with it before the network noticed?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:45:01
Can you explain this technically to me? How can a minor actually reverse several blocks? I assume it has to do with picking a different chain to mine...
What real world implications of this are there? Could someone effectively spend a bitcoin twice? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:08:21
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:41:36
So really, the likelihood of them getting much monetary value from this would be very unlikely?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:13:42
But then what's the point of a hard cap?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:07:54
Great. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:13:36
In this scenario, I envision the actor using his computing power to double spend on as many proof of work coins as possible. Profiting from as many as possible before they crash...
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:27:51
Why the barrier decrease? If the algorithms ensure the difficulty is on par with mining hardware of the day, the costs of mining will stay similarly high
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:17:25
Thanks for the resource!
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:42:04


Ah bravo. Thank you for the constructive feedback. Apparently, this is the exact attitude that has led you to post nothing of value. Keep it up (\*applause\*)
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:23:55
Absolutely destroys the argument of digital gold 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:19:48
So is there truly no economic incentive to double spending?
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:48:24
Please post the reviews you feel are comprehensive enough. I would like to see them. Thank you
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:30:25
What leads you to that conclusion?
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:22:07


What about my analysis seems superficial to you? I would like to understand your perspective

Jesus, what purpose does r/Bitcoin serve if one can't ask questions like this? You guys should be ashamed.
Also, of course, I've contacted people directly. I'm pursuing many different avenues.
