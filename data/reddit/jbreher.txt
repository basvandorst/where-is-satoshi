Oh come on. We couldn't even come up with a scaling solution in time to avoid congestion, given over four years of advance knowledge.

Incorrect. In a fully trustless manner limited only by the threat of a 51% attack - to which so called 'full nodes' (actually fully-validating, non-mining wallets) are also vulnerable.


If an SPV wallet is worried about potential privacy leaks, it can build a bigger filter. The ratio of privacy:brevity is fully within the control of the SPV wallet, limited only by 'gimme all of it'.


An SPV wallet owns its private keys. To that extent, it is in full control of the associated funds. When you deposit money in a bank, it ceases being your money. You become a creditor of the bank, and you own only an IOU. If you don't understand the difference, you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.

Only in the case where one does not vet their upstream provider. If you feel you need tighter security, you have the option.


Of course it is. Though you may need to invest in more than a Raspberry Pi.


And your point is...? Again, you have the full spectrum of privacy:brevity available to you.

You're aware that SPV wallets also flawlessly perform this function, right?
@_date: 2017-02-10 00:05:20
Your reply is a non sequitir. There is any number of mischievous ways an entity with 51% can disrupt the network. Including exceeding any block size that the rest of the network might want to try to enforce.

Failure to link "actual academic peer reviewed studies" supporting your statement is duly noted.
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:58:43
the problems bitcoin faces right now are of economical nature, not of technical ones.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:24:48


Not that I have seen. I have seen one study that was conducted two years ago, that concluded 10% of current nodes might stop being nodes at 4MB. That is rather different from a study today proving 4MB 'is too much'.
@_date: 2017-02-16 19:53:56
And you don't see this capital requirement a centralizing force?

What part of 


were you unable to understand?
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:38:06
There will never be huge transactions allowed at negligible cost. Any miner that includes such transactions will find his blocks orphaned. Accordingly, the price for large transactions will be set at a rate the network can accommodate, by natural rational miner self-interest. No artificial external limit is needed to bring this about.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:58:34


Unintentional irony?
Your presumption of which group's efforts are more indicative of an attempt to 'dismantle Bitcoin' looks awfully different from this side of the argument.
@_date: 2017-02-14 18:51:56


And enough BTC to lock up a reflective amount in each channel opened. Right?
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:50:26
If we accept that miners mine empty blocks only in the interval between being presented with a potentially solved block, and the time they validate that solved block, then the only way '50% of the miners would be mining empty blocks', would be if it took half a block interval to do the validation. 
In short: your hypothetical is ludicrous.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:27:41
Are you referring to your 'shrink it first, then start growing it' fork? Please tell me that you realize that you are in the minority in belief that this fulfills the spirit of the HK agreement.

Probably a new DoS attempt. My BU 0.12.1.0 (i.e. old) node has restarted three times in the last fifteen minutes.

So amongst these blocks of malleated transactions, who exactly has been harmed by the malleation? Who experienced a concrete and measurable loss? 
Might those who experienced and actual loss have avoided such by using a better client -- without recourse to a protocol change?
@_date: 2016-11-27 02:12:40


Interesting. So you maintain that The SegWit Omnibus Changeset, which couples segregated witness (which is alone the biggest change to bitcoin protocol since inception) with several other crufty features -- including a variable size block size increase, is somehow a bigger change than a simple block size increase? You are delusional.
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:17:02


Well, no. 'Compromise' is something negotiated between multiple parties with conflicting desires. The SegWit Omnibus Changeset was the unilaterally-decided bid for appeasement at best. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 02:17:05
Which makes one wonder why The SegWit Omnibus Changeset (i.e., Core 0.13.1) couples segregated witness with a soft fork protocol, a variable block size increase, a change to the versionbits usage making future soft forks easier to foist upon the system, a change to the hashing calculations enabling more efficient handling of large witnesses, and more. 
Several of these things may be useful. However, it seems to me sheer folly to couple them in one forklift upgrade.
@_date: 2016-12-01 00:00:34


Seems like you've not been hearing what has been being said. Most arguments that I have heard did not consist of pumping 2MB blocks, but rather advocating that maxblocksize stay large enough to accommodate demand. The residual 'attacks' on segwit of which I am aware being made by more than a few consist primarily of:
- segregated witness itself is bundled along with much not-necessarily-related cruft which add to the risk of The SegWit Omnibus Changeset
- by the time it activates, 2MB will be too little too late
- one time nature ensures need to revisit 
@_date: 2016-11-27 02:01:52
Speaking for myself, I would prefer a hard fork. The entire 'soft fork' nature of The SegWit Omnibus Changeset is one of its worst aspects.

What makes you think Tether has USD backing? It has all the hallmarks of a fraudulent peg.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:54:47
Your reply is nonsensical. Non-mining nodes are irrelevant. They have no way to work on extending blocks, nor to refuse to work on them. The only expression of validity that matters to the network is by those entities that can work on extending blocks or refuse to work on blocks. These are manifestly restricted to mining entities.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:15:44
Yes, it would by definition make those blocks valid to the network. Miners working on those blocks by extending the chain is the only measure of validity that Bitcoin has. At that point, the only option users have is to abandon it.
Non-mining nodes are useful to their owners, but absolutely powerless to the network at large.
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:42:42
Not at all. It says that miners enforce any needed rules.

"They vote with their CPU proof-of-worker, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks *by working on extending them* and rejecting invalid blocks by *refusing to work on them*. *Any* needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
- satoshi nakamoto, the bitcoin whitepaper
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:58:08
I'm conversant with Nakamoto Consensus. Thanks for the sideswipe.
And if there is not universal user agreement that the new rules are intolerable? What if you are in the minority? Indeed, why don't you answer my question? I answered yours.
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:05:00
Give it up Adam. Not only are your arguments irrational here, they are also irrelevant. The S2X launch will occur. No amount of internet whiteknighting on either side will have any effect upon this.
We'll come out the other side with the victorious design chosen by the marketplace. As Bitcoin is designed to do. Only then will the majority/minority question be able to be answered definitively.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:29:51
Relevance? 
Regardless, I think he meant that if you do not like the direction the network has decided to go, you can cause your node to not participate with that network.
Here's one for you: what effect will your node transitioning to safe mode have upon the miners who have agreed (either explicitly or implicitly) upon rules you don't like?
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:06:08


Well, that's just silly. The miners _determine_ the rules. From the whitepaper:
"They vote with their CPU proof-of-worker, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:11:41
As a stalwart supporter of emergent consensus, I heartily endorse this kamikaze attack. 2017 Aug 01 will be a very interesting day.

The rest of us merely abdicated our power. Who knew?
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:52:32


rather presumptuous statement, that is.
@_date: 2016-07-27 20:34:19
Why? Perhaps because the loaded keywords 'progress', 'liberty', and 'justice' are most often employed as newspeak antonyms.
@_date: 2016-07-27 20:23:29
Hmm... 
- forkers that willingly abandoned the 'immutable ledger' and 'code is the contract' principles are off on a chain that fits their desires
- stayers that believed in first stated principles are off on a chain that reflects those original stated principles
- market share sum of ETH &amp; ETC today greater than ETH before the fork
Somebody wanna explain to me what the problem is? To my eyes, the fork seems to be a smashing success from every angle.
