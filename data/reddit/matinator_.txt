If litecoin was released before bitcoin, or some coin that has the same marketcap, then that coin would be the most valuable I think, but you are right, basically, every coin is a copy of bitcoin, no matter how you look at it.

3 months ago, people thought they were too late as well, waiting now is just wrong, the earlier you buy, the more profit you &gt; should &lt; have, just trust in bitcoin and everything will be alright in the end, I really believe it will rise to at least $3k.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:31:05
True, we'll just have to give it time and see what will happen in the following days / weeks. I'm sure that litecoin will rise after the weekend, to like 45-50 quickly. It'll be interesting, that's for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:31:17
Up $130 in last 5 minutes, don't worry, it's gonna riseeeeeee
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:27:35
Wow, you made alot of money then, enjoy it!
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:32:12
Up $150 in last 5  minutes
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:27:04
I am rational, I really am, I just see a bright future for btc, and didn't believe it was going down today. It'll rise, but I wouldn't invest too much in it just yet, I'd wait, just like you're saying, but this is a good sign.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:23:32
Just a bad day I guess, will most likely go back up.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:39:30
Agree with you, just the new people that might be scared about this, it's of course not nice to see this, but this is what you can expect when investing, it just can't always be positive..
Think this was just because of the weekend though.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:02:30
Also, go to this site, helps much more than the one you're on in the pic.
Just my opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:40:16
I upvoted you, and I agree 100% on everything that you said.
I see some other coins that have huge potential as well, like primecoin, namecoin and peercoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:13:00
Thank you for this, you are one of the people that help bitcoin grow.
Upvoted your thread.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:24:22
Wait 2 years and you'll get 20x more Euro's or dollars or yen for the same amount of bitcoins, just don't sell yet.
But just make sure you cash out your investment, so you make no lose even if bitcoins crash, and keep some bitcoins, just keep some, you might regret it later on if you sell alot of them.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:36:09
It's rising again,  don't be happy (if you wanted this to happen) / sad (if you invested), it's risingggggg
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:40:02
Knew there was something wrong with the year that I said haha, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:51:21
Just buy now..
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.
The second best time is to plant it today.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:04:46
Well, yes, I would be, because I'd buy a shitload of them then.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:50:10
I think you've just made a nice amount of money.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:34:04
Nah, up $150 in last 5 minutes, it's rising again
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:49:08
Who doesn't..
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:38:01
So what? I don't hear you whining about it when it rises 10%, it's going to happen that it'll go down a bit, but it'll go up again most likely, close that site, and keep it closed for the next 5 hours and then look again since I don't think you're going to sell within a few hours anyways

I don't think you'll become rich with 0.003 bitcoins, there would be too many people that'd be rich, by the time that a bitcoin is $10 000, who would buy lots of bitcoins at once? I think there'd be more people that'd try to sell some bitcoins, like 5 at once, but I don't think the demand would still be that high, that's just one option.
Other option is that you could actually become rich with 0.003 bitcoins, it's about long term, who knows what the price will be in a few years.
There should &gt;exist&lt; 21m bitcoins by 2042(?), but you also have to take in account that alot of coins are just lost, like people that mined, and lost their wallets, forgot them, maybe people that had alot of bitcoins that died..
Only thing that will show us howmuch bitcoins you'll need to have to be rich is time.

There is no best time to cash out, it's all up to you, if you need the cash, cash out, if you don't really need it, I'd suggest cashing out your investment anyways, so you don't really have a big risk.
How can you see if it's going to crash?
One and only answer: you can't.
Back in april, bitcoin crashed for like 50%, people panic sold, and it started rising slowly again. 
just think about it this way;
Alot of people are just not buying now because they think that the price is too high, but once it starts crashing a little bit, people think it's their chance to buy bitcoins, because it's at a price so low, it will probably never will be again.
This is just my opinion on it and I could be wrong, but it's been like this in the past.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:09:07
My calculations estimate he's around 11
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:18:24
What about Anoncoin? You might be interested in that.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:55:56
Completely disagree with you, bitcoin did not everything the best way possible, they were just first.
Big difference there.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:44:02
You could be right, that's what I've been telling alot of people as well, that the price might rise like hell in the following months, when it really becomes mainstream, but you're really talking about 40 years from now I guess, I don't know if Bitcoin then would still exist, maybe something else has passed Bitcoin by then, something that still has to be invented...
Who know what the future will bring, but I'm certain it'll hit $3-4k by april next year.
