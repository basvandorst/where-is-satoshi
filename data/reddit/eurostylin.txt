Seems like a horrible business plan to me.   
It would be better for BTC as a whole if you accepted other payments and the consumers who don't use BTC see that you accept it, and might look into what it is.
Thanks for at least accepting BTC though!

I've purchased over $50k worth of bitcoins through coinbase over the last three months with my chase account.   I've never had an issue.   When chase restricts an account, they send you a letter.  Please post up that letter. 
This is the internet, don't expect me to believe you without proof.  
Otherwise, this seems very odd to me.   Chase is one of the largest banks in the US, and I find it odd that only one person has been flagged for "illegal gambling" through coinbase. 
edit:  every purchase has been over $4k.  I've spent $61,843.38 on BTC through coin base from my chase account since December 5th.     My largest purchase being $19,000 at once.  
I do have business accounts with chase, but all of my purchases have been out of my personal checking account.
2nd edit, due to some pm's I received.  I have converted most of my BTC to LTC, and yes I've claimed every single penny of profit on my earnings.   My accountant and myself spent countless hours of research going over details to make sure I was doing everything by the book.

I see three players for a while, and then two players. 
If Doge changes their name, it could be taken seriously down the road. 
If Doge doesn't, it will be Litecoin and Bitcoin.
I'm surprised more bitcoin money isn't flooding into litecoin as we speak, as their network is up and running without issue.

And it was replaced with a BTC/LTC  button :) 
While bitcoin is wonderful, we are now learning why owning more than one cryptocurrency can be beneficial.

"Stuck with litecoins, which nobody fucking uses"? 
Just had the best f'n corned beef sandwich down the street from  and paid with litecoin.   
Anyway,  good job on the video, besides that.

I received your contact information, we'll be in touch.

 I've been a patron for many years.    Their corned beef sandwhich is amazing.   These guys started accepting BTC and LTC way before it was main stream.   Good people.
They have two locations,  Farminghton Hills, and Pontiac.

Even though this is not involving Bitcoin, it is nice to see crypto currency backers offsetting the carbon footprint of mining!

How are you handling this auction?   You are not handling this through bitcointalk, right? 
If you decide to proceed through a legit auction house, please update this post ASAP to an auction link.  I will not participate in a closed (silent) auction handled through an anonymous internet forum, and I'm sure most legitimate bidders would feel the same.  If you need an auction house that will handle this in BTC, I can set it up for you.   If you do not mind sending me contact information, I would also like to call you and talk to you about purchasing it out right today.   
This is my father's dream car, and it would make me extremely happy to have some of my early gambles in life (LTC and BTC) pay off where I could reward him with this.  I am 100% serious and a legitimate player in the LTC scene.  I can easily convert the LTC to BTC for the purchase. 
Thank you. 
edit:  Thought I would update that I do not feel comfortable becoming non-anonymous by sending you my personal information until I can confirm this is a legitimate setup.  Again, please send me a way to communicate with you,  I would feel more comfortable with a phone call.

With fees factored in, I purchased at $141.14

Didn't want to get flagged for spam, so I didn't post the link...
Anyway,

What the hell does your opinion of the future of BTC have to do with me not being able to buy coffee and silver over the internet using BTC because the confirmations are not happening?  
 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:31:42
Wow, I'm totally lost here. I'm going to look into how this works.
edit:   
Is that what you're referencing? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:45:19
haha, I see what you did there :(
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:06:26
I'm heading to the D on Friday,  I'm going to head there to eat just so I can finally use my BTC locally.   I've talked to so many shop owners around town, and most say they will transition to accept it.   Hopefully one day this will be the norm.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:40:36
Not me!! I already purchased two t-shirts using btc.   It was actually really exciting for me.   Maybe I lead a boring life.  lol
Honestly, that business would have never received business from me if it they didn't accept btc.  I really wanted to see how the transaction worked, it was incredibly smooth.

I'm happy to see we have math professors in this sub!  :)

We have not seen a delay like this since March. 
That chart is an average,  I have two unconfirmed orders over an hour old.  Any idea on what is going on?    Both of my orders are to new companies I have never dealt with before... 
edit:  transactions 84 minutes and 98 minutes!!! Almost two hours :( 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:03:39
It worked!!  Thanks guys.

Bitcoins are a gamble to begin with, these people REALLY like living on the edge.
Market calls with 1h lag is insane.
