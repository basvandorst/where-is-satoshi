Coinbase did double charge me yesterday for my purchase, maybe hold off a few days so that can work this issue out. I’m not the only one who’s having this problem.

Purchased. Good luck on future endeavors ��

Bitcoin Reddit isn’t the end all of Bitcoin, but we do need to express the virtues of Bitcoin and ignore Bcash like the rest of the other altcoin garbage. 
I think Ver’s contestant trolling is causing people to lose focus on what we can accomplish with Bitcoin. Do what we learned a long time ago, ignore the trolls. That also means ignoring the King of the Trolls, Roger Ver

Ok Buzzfeed, your premise is hedged on them selling the BTC. What if they actually want the BTC to hold and spend? They know they won’t get many purchases with BTC so are willing to accept it as an occasional investment.
What you are really railing against is services like BitPay.

The problem with your analogy is the oil has value because of what it can do. 
Bitcoin can’t do anything except represent value. We should therefore spend it as value so it is valued.
It’s simple if you intend to convert future fiat to Bitcoin to hodl but have a use case where you can spend it. Exchange the value you plan to spend in addition to your hodl amount. Spend and hold.
Everyone who wants their unit of account (Bitcoin) to be valued as wealth in the future should use a portion of Bitcoin as an exchange for valuable goods and services. 
If we can’t use Bitcoin in an exchange of value (ie: trade) it can not store value since their is nothing unique about it other then scarcity and security. 
Polished Pope Poo is an example of a scare item that has limited reproduction but are entirely worthless. They may become worth something if I can convince others to use them as a standard unit of account and medium of value transfer. Holding onto my PPP with the expectation that someone else will do something to make them worth Hodling is crazy. 
We need to facilitate the perception of value buy transacting with our value store, Bitcoin

Are we assuming anthropogenic climate change?
Without the current fossil fuel technology humanity would be far smaller. Modern agriculture would not exist.
Should we outlaw fossil fuels and kill billions of people?
