Kind of MF WEIRD that Coinbase crashed right when BTC went sub 10k. Now it’s working and BTC is over 11k. So pissed.

Get out.

I can’t wait until the house intel memo is released. It will be a big dose of reality for many.

This is some incredible fear-mongering. /politics is leaking again.

I want to be jacked. Jacked to the Bits

So... should I buy now?

Too bad people can ruin other people’s lives/careers with unproven accusations.

Use all the student loans you can get approved for to buy more support beams.

I have buys pending on Coinbase. Once they clear I want to move them into a wallet and leave Coinbase. What is a good exchange and wallet app I can use on iOS mobile?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:15:29
I keep getting this issue. Still trying to figure out why it’s happening
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:26:45
A true man of his word. But this is way too far and fucked up.

Man, this is obnoxious. I’d laugh but it’s just sad that some people think and speak like this.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:14:20
Simple fix. Find a longer stick and poke again
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:48:12
Riiight. Lay off the ShareBlue my man. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:41:20

Tick tock.... 
The “meaningless hyperbole (memo) meant to generate votes” should be out any minute now....
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:34:08
Then 5k soon
