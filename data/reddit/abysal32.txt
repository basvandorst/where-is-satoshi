Unless you understand at a relatively deep level how UTXO’s work with paper wallets and how to spend your bitcoin fully from them. I’d recommend a hardware wallet like ledger or Trezor over a paper wallet. Losing bitcoins with a paper wallet can happen relatively easily.

Hey bro it took almost every one of my family members less than 8 hours to get verified and set up with a deposit on Gemini. I’d suggest you call them if you actually have an issue they have been nothing but great.

You saying your going to “off yourself” because they are charging 10$ and 3.5% is sad and disgusting bro. If you don’t like what someone charges don’t use them. But try reading their fees and policies before you go complaining about it after the fact.  As far as you being a great guy because you gave away 30$ worth of bitcoin is also ridiculous lol, I thought you were completely new to the space ? Just came barreling in bought on the first high priced exchange you found then donated it away? Sure thing
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:26:18
Fuck you man, your a fucking liar, you wanted to shit on  btc and the community so you made up a bullshit story and conveniently found the subreddit you wanted to shit on and posted a fucking filthy lying sack of shit story

That would be satoshi bud
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:23:07
Scam bullshit post.... so “your completely new to this” and your not really sure what your doing so in your words you wanted a $100 worth of something so you clicked buy without any research into the item you wanted or the fees associated with the buy order?? Your a fucking asshole dyor 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:36:23
When charges get thrown out or dropped one is not guilty of them period. You can show any evidence you want about any accusation one can muster up in court but... the sentence handed down on the accused better be based on the charges that aren’t dropped. And certainly the sentence should be within the scope of others who had done similar crimes. Ross was given a blatantly ridiculous and unjust sentence on crimes that deserve no where near that type of punishment.
Your the type of guy DeVeelvraat that just follows the media’s every word and spits out the same garbage verbatim instead of looking at the actual evidence against Ross or anyone else that has perpetrated a non violent crime and making a rational more reasonable conclusion on your own. Grow up kid. You don’t put people in a cage for life for this type of shit.
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:09:33
Listen up Deveelvraat you fucking monkey,  maybe you didn’t get the memo on “ innocent until proven guilty” but......... all the charges of murder or hiring a hitman or conspiracy to commit murder were DROPPED. Bottom line is the man got a RIDICULOUSLY long sentence for running a website. You calling him a complete scumbag  is such a disgusting overreach on ones ability to judge someone else’s character, especially of a man you didn’t know. Pray or hope you are never judged by random assholes as guilty of a crime you were never convicted of. As for his character ask his friends and family who he was.

Your gonna be fine bro. Relax and wait. Use a wallet that has the feature replace by fee. Also you leaving the computer on doesn’t help or hurt the speed.

Are you daft friend or entirely ignorant? He isn’t a bankster or some guy running a Ponzi scheme or a drug baron. I agree those people can drive people to suicide though loss of wealth or in the drug barons case cause chaos and death in a community. He ran a fucking website which allowed for peer to peer sales of goods. Some illicit some not. Not sure about you my “dissident” pal but I’m OK with adults transacting peer to peer and not disturbing the peace or causing mass loss of wealth. Attempt to formulate a complete thought next time and stay on topic when you make a comment.
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:20:02
Bow out kid, you lost the argument and any semblance of a point you were attempting to make when you said drug baron or bankster. You should also attempt to reconsider what you regard yourself as. A dissident doesn’t shit on peer to peer anything. Certainly not between consenting adults.

Yes if you buy a bar of gold , you don’t lose money if the price for gold goes down the next day. You lose equity. You still have one bar of gold.
@_date: 2019-09-29 04:24:05
If you buy 1 bitcoin at $8000 and the next day bitcoin is worth $7400 you have exactly 1 bitcoin of value.
You don’t have any dollars at all once you buy a bitcoin my friend. You have 1 bitcoin which has an equity value in $ of $8000. The next day you will have 1 bitcoin. Equity equivalent in dollars to $7400.
TLDR: you don’t lose $$$ unless you sell bud. You still have exactly 1 bitcoin.

Hey asshole go fuck yourself, asking people how much they own of an asset is literally life threatening. Do some research and make an educated guess or don’t and stop trying to acquire data on random people.
