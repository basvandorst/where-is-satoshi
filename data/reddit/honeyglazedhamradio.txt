GDAX batch transfers as efficiently as possible as to minimize the load on them. Which is why there’s no fees. My last transfer from gdax was a part of a 12 bitcoin transaction, although I only got my portion of it, of course. It could take only minutes, or it could take hours. Never noticed a concrete difference when transferring different amounts of coins. Just gotta let it run its course. I can’t complain because there are no fees!

Hope they don’t live in the US.

It’s unwise to use it as a payment at this time anyways. Just wait until BTC finds it’s true value and stabilizes. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:34:57
The value of bitcoin would have to be more than astronomical for 8 decimals to still be too valuable to afford. We say “to the moon” all the time but even then you have to be realistic.

This is a Terrible Time for transactions.

They’re just worried about the volatility of the market. Unstable prices could lead to a loss of profit. Just wait out the storm and hope it settles high!

I’ve never heard of anyone mirroring a Trezor before. I’m not sure they can be used for the same account, although I’ve only ever used one. I would say it would be safer to split them just in case, although I’ve never dealt with using two before. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:58:25
Yeah I don’t think this is the right place. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:17:46
Correction. It’s unstable and unrealistic that it jumps up that much. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:07:40
Gdax bro
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:23:42
There’s a reason why it’s decreasing bro
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:29:12
This leads to more and more mass panic sells and is no good for any market.

More realistic if she hangs from the top and then falls every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:15:24
Don’t hodl your breath... but I believe you may be right!
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:00:39
I put money in from time to time without my girlfriends knowledge. She’ll thank me later. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:21:02
Down by less than 1,000 and climbing again. You really don’t know how to count do you? Just seems like a minor correction. We’ve had worse. Calm down.
Edit: Gdax broke, Who Dis?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:58
This is insane
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:45
Look at all those limit sells. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:03:49
Buy and hodl is only strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:17:51
It’s not necessarily bad to mine, it’s just that the difficulty has risen to a point that is unprofitable for single machines. At this point, server farms and large pools are the only ones still viably powerful enough to mine more bitcoin than money they use to run. Joining a mining pool wouldn’t be a bad idea if you had a few (3-4 etc.) dedicated mining systems, although with only one system, even a strong one, it wouldn’t mine enough to keep itself running alone. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:04:15
You’re better off buying small amounts here and there and waiting for them to appreciate. Those computers alone are too weak to mine anything profitable. Even if you join a mining pool, you’ll more than likely spend more on the electricity you use to keep them running than the money you’ll make. Especially with weak graphics. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:21:08
I'm not too familiar with Armory although I am aware that the fees are particularly limited to special cases. If I'm correct, one of those cases could include receiving lots of small transactions and then withdrawing them as a larger transaction, such as taking small payments from customers and then withdrawing them all at once in a single transfer. If using an individual account for business the best advice I can give you would be to research wallets and exchanges that maximize efficiency for your type of business. If you come across a convincing yet unfamiliar exchange, be sure to read reviews on credibility as well!

OP: “how dare you use secure digital currency in era of the the digital age! Don’t you know it’s better to use easily stolen, shiny rocks for trading!”
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:25
Hitting 10k was a pretty big barrier. Bitcoin is currently ranked  on google trends in the US, and there’s a lot of media exposure as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:03:54
Supply and demand ratio is controlled by mining difficulty/actual demand. Seeing as supply will end growth permanently, and demand can only rise, I don’t see your point. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:42:08
Do you have this in a readable resolution?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:16
Now is a terrible time for buys/sells. The amount of buys I’m watching fall through on gdax right now is astounding. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:23:10
Of course! :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:34:20
Check age restrictions before using an exchange. Don’t buy if you’d be sad to see that money go. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:59:23
Like seriously. What even brought him over here.

This is true. In terms of altcoins, a profit can be made with an ASIC if the right coin is chosen. Not enough to necessarily make you a millionaire. Although the market is fairly unpredictable. I was just speaking in terms of bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:04
Coinbase and GDAX are connected so funds can easily be transferred between them if needed. Although GDAX has limited transfer fees, Coinbase has tones. Don’t know much about bitflyer. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:26:05
You must be from Jodel. Welcome! :D and I will say, don’t invest anything you aren’t prepared to lose. The coin is extremely volatile. While we’re all optimistic, anything can happen. It would be unwise to use your loan (or any borrowed money) in full for any type of investment. If you wouldn’t mind investing a bit of it, that wouldn’t be as big of a problem! You just don’t want to be out of luck and out of money if worst comes to worst.

OP’s last reddit post before this one is titled “Any good looking virgin guys on here???” in r/nofap. I’m sure he’s an expert in economics and currency.

Cant even log on at the moment. Just hodling so no big deal but still. Dang.

I’m game if you are!

Gemini allows for the creation of Institutional accounts for business. Coinbase also has larger transfer fees that may deter you from using it often. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:45:17
These memes are getting annoying on the sub, but I’m glad that some are making the front page!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:53:50
Coinbase also verifies your identity to an extent. They’re tied with GDAX and messing up in one could get you set off for both in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:00:14
None of those computers are going to make you any money. What exactly isn’t affordable? You can buy in fractions of bitcoin if you’re tight on money. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:45:13
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:03:51

I’m still at 1250 on my Coinbase. May or may not be because of the enormous amount of new users. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:50:15
That’s the sad part. Look at the bottom half of the comments. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:12
Wouldn’t that put it in the negatives?
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:13:02
If you only have one of either, then neither unless you want to lose money. You’re WAY better off putting that money into buying a fraction of a bitcoin then watching it rise. That’s the neat thing about bitcoin, it’s scalable. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:09
The 1250 is currently my Debit instant deposit. I usually use that because it’s instant. My bank transfer limit is 7500 but I don’t use it because I only buy about 50-100 at a time. 
Edit: after just setting it up, my paypal withdrawal limit is 15000 a week. Would take even longer to get to my bank account, but I guess good for larger withdrawals.
