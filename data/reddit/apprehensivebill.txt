A lot more people will believe in the currency if they make an ETF out of it

Pretty sure the price drops when a trade (one buy and one sale) happens at a price lower than the price at which llthe previous trade occured.

credit card transactions take less than five seconds, faster than crypto. like you said, crypto takes minutes, which is not good for small transactions.  but large transactions that require a bank transfer, then yes crypto is still only minutes which is great.

What if we got back to the topic of transaction speed?
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:39:34
okay lol
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:25:45
you mean 500 lira??

Let that sink in or be rational and make financial decisions that make sense for you and your family . . .
Ultimately, yes cryptocurrency is an incredible technology, but just like how for every Google there were hundreds of tech companies that failed in the early 2000s, there will be plenty of casualties from the cryptocurrency revolution as well..
If you need to sell, then sell.  If you think it's wise to buy and hold, do that. If you have the time and energy to day trade, best of luck to you.  Everyone's situation is different but nobody should let emotion and shitty infographics interfere with sound financial decision-making.

OP is an extremely low effort post.

I mean, the same thing happens when i send or receive with venmo -- it's not really advantageous for small transactions like that.

It's just a question of moderation and degree.  There are definitely employers who bully their workers and underpay them, while there are also workers who abuse their rights and get paid for work they don't do.

I bet people in Venezuela would be happy if they burnt their bolivars for heating the stove lmao

First of all, nothing in OP is empirical.  
Second of all, things with value that are not used for payment provide other value.  Houses give shelter for example. However bitcoin is specifically a currency, and excluding its value as a currency, it is in fact worthless.
A huge reason bitcoin has fallen so much is people are realizing that it's actually not that great a payment tool. It takes 10+ minutes to process a transaction, which is vastly inferior to fiat money systems like venmo, or any credit card for example.
Now, bitcoin does have a much better competitive advantage for huge payment sums that would require a multi-day bank transfer, but for most people, that's really not relevant.
Still, I do believe bitcoin will increase in value in the long-term, but given it's volatility and minute-scale transaction times, it's really not useful to 99% of people except as a long-term (basically retirement) investment.

It's actually not instant . . . if it was then it would be worth one thousand times more.

It's definitely not gold and never will be. Gold is a commodity that has many industrial (and cultural/religious) applications.
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:35:28
And gold is down 7% since the beginning of 2018 . . . There's a reason the dollar is the world reserve currency . . .

Why are you buying into the false choice of store of value and currency?? Currency is supposed to be a store of value!
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:04:52
The US dollar is the world's reserve currency; it is objectively the single most popular store of value in the world. If a currency is not a store of value, it becomes a failed currency.  
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:46:26
Okay then you don't know what store of value means, Google it it's like a first year college econ concept.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:16:09
Can't buy groceries with euros in the us or dollars in Germany.  OP Twitter is just an idiot.  And yes, currencies are supposed to be good stores of value.
