The days of BTC coming to merchants are long past. BTC is about going OFF THE GRID and preserving individual private wealth .

Bitcoin has gone up slightly while alt coins have added billions in market cap in the last week. This is hot air and will not end well for alts when it does.

1. use google 2fa app. 
2. Make sure phone encryption is on. 
3. Store the 2FA back up key on trezor password manager.

What the actual fuck .  Will someone please end this BU nightmare

Because how you enter the pin on the nano is annoying and the buttons suck

It's obvious Roger and the unlimited team purchased a bunch of VMs to boost the node numbers.

in other words, since the mass media is so sure bitcoin will go to zero, now that margin is available in a US exchange, funds now have a great place to short bitcoin for easy money

They are paying for coins via the cost of hardware and electricity. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:28:54
honestly, who is really surprised by this?
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:14:35
I hope not, i'm just getting into bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:30:05
Verification was done fast but buying coins with my bank it took 4 days or so to clear by CB and be delivered into my wallet
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:38:04
mega unsuprise
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:00:22
mega fail, they are about 1 year late. 'Blockchain' is out, bitcoin is coming back in
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:08:15
thank you!

If what Wu is doing to LTC is any indication, its 100% fact Segwit for bitcoin will NEVER get activated at its threshold by miners.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:12:24
i'm so tired of this malicious clown
@_date: 2017-04-12 01:05:28
his twitter looks like a troll account 
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:34:04
This guy is a clown, people need to stop giving him attention 
@_date: 2017-04-10 03:16:00
If extension blocks were a good idea, core devs would have done it instead of segwit 
@_date: 2017-04-10 02:41:58
What is the point of extension blocks when so much time and testing has been put into segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:32:02
I hope this is real but these are paid articles, be careful people. The timing seems "too good"
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:46:30
it will have 15% at worst then right after the fork we will see it slowly go back to legacy . Miners not going to stay mining 2x too long if the price is less than the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:23:28
litecoin is one thing but a shitcoin with less than 12mil market cap trying to get attention with segwit in not news here
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:01:41
leave it, eventually all that money will be a btc rally when the grand xrp dump happens. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:31:23
this is getting tiresome 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:31:20
a few days ago i saw an email notification that ip from china tried to log into my account there. I never used it or deposited so i don't care but Sounds like they have been hacked or are setting up a hack exit scam.
@_date: 2017-05-07 16:49:28
People like this will not understand until crypto is a 1 trillion dollar MC and they are trying to buy  
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:32:20
even more reason to NEVER activate the 2x part
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:48:46
yes, see here
