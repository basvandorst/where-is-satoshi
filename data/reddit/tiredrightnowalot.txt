Only guess I could throw out is the upgrade to 1.6 with the fork.  Multipools aren't able to mine dogecoin the way the were; well I guess they CAN but they aren't.  So a lot of the pools are gone which is going to (in theory) raise the price of doge and stabilize it.  Hopefully.

Idiot sport that pulls in about $3B in revenue annually.  Idiot teams that are worth, on average, over $100M each.  Yep, bunch of idiots over there, just swimming in money.
Oh, and it has approximately 75,000,000 fans.

It looks that way.  It's yet to be proven, but it's a complete mess.

Haven't really been following that.  Maybe to have no accountability for the funds?   But I really don't know.  One thing that has been coming up is a lack of disclosure on previous alias' and things of that nature.  Not sure if too much of the paperwork and agreements even remain legal if he wasn't up front about that.  was lit up with conversation about that earlier.
End of the day, I'm not sure anyone truly knows anything, but there's certainly a lot of speculation.

Sorry but your own statements are pretty ignorant.  You are saying that everyone knew he was shady and continued to do business, but you're missing the start of the whole ordeal, when moolah_ seemed to be pretty genuine.  You're starting your position from when he started to raise eyebrows and people were beginning to get away from doing business with him.  One thing to remember is that he was an excellent marketer of his brand (Alex Green, not Moolah).  He started to get really bad at this however once he was questioned by people as to what his real intent was, or who he really was....

And it's last on an international stage!  I'd love to be good enough at something to be last at The OLYMPICS!  My god, I'd be lucky to place in a respectable spot at any sport in my city.
That said, I used to play rep soccer, does that count?

I like this comment;.  Dogecoin may prove to be a stepping stone for many people.  As an avid doge user, I've definitely been poking my nose in to more BTC related things in the last week or so.  Time to get my feet wet perhaps.

I agree here; one thing I always try to teach my team at work is this:  No one will ever give you credit when you miss a goal because one thing didn't go your way.  So, when you do get a win, take the credit because even if a 20M donation and then a challenge put you there, you still got there. 
That's a little hashed up, but regardless of the 2 huge donations, it happened because the community got together.  If we didn't, it wouldn't have even started.

Moolah is supposedly the management of Mintpal.  This was set up not too long ago.  The Mintpal founders (from what I have read) aren't complicit in this scheme.  I think it's pretty much just the one person who had a master, evil, plan.

Online purchases:  Identity fraud; happens more than you think.  Not in the Sandra Bullock / "The Net" kind of way, but it does happen.  I'm a retailer who has worked in many stores where this has been a true threat to our business.  Someone swipes a bunch of credit card numbers from an internet database, and sells them.  From there, purchases ensue for quick-to-turnover merchandise.  Think:  PlayStation / Sony Store a few years ago, how many numbers were taken just from that alone?
Chargebacks:  Two years ago one of my stores had a $70,000 chargeback from purchases that were made within 15 minutes of each other by a group of fraudsters.  No joking here; it was organized, calculated, and cost me $70k.  Six months later, over $100,000 of chargebacks from a 30 day period where a gang hit several of my stores for repetitive fraud.  The thing with this fraud is that there are several security measures involved, usually required by the credit company.  Unfortunately, if one of the accomplices works for said credit company, everything goes south.  In this particular case we were able to dig up proof of an assistant in the fraud department of a credit company, and yet my business took the write off.  No bull here; I have the statement to prove it - and no, I won't and can't share.
I don't believe you when you say that you transfer money free of charge to your friends and families.  I transfer money to two recipients frequently and every time I get a service charge of $2.95.  Sure, some banks will negate the charges, but I doubt that they do unlimited transfers due to fees and charges that they would incur from other banks / institutions.
I'm not sure that Bitcoin will improve your life; I'm not sure that it will improve, or even change mine at all.  I think it's very interesting and something that will challenge how our governments look at money and look at the way they are taxing / removing money from people.  I'm by no means someone who thinks that the government over taxes the people in their country, or a conspiracy type person, but I do believe that challenging something so basic to our every day lives can't hurt. 
I didn't jump in here to challenge your opinions btw, more that I could end some practical experience on the chargebacks / credit issues.

Last time I went out to a club I dropped $450 getting shit faced drunk.  I bought a couple of bottles and had a great time in the VIP section with friends.  Great times.
So far in doge, I've spent about $300 and had a couple of weeks of fun, contributed to building wells for needy people in Kenya, contributed to sponsoring the NASCAR event, and tipped a bunch of people some coins for fun.  I've had a good time with this, more than at the club dropping 50% more money.
If you don't like dogecoin, that's absolutely not a problem.  Don't participate, don't buy coins.  No worries.  Thanks to dogecoin, I toyed with mining, I invested a little money- more for fun than anything else.  I've also spent some on bitcoin because I feel like it's a good idea to have something a little more stable.  It's bringing people to your community too.
Like I said, it's okay not to like it.  To shit on it because it's not something you like - all the while it's being used by people to give back to others and add some positive energy to different communities.... that just makes you a loser man.  Lose the attitude and don't participate if you don't want to - otherwise you're welcome to come to and experience some people having fun together, in a positive subreddit.

Hey there,
dogecoiner here.  The last thing we want to do is come to tell you that you suck.  Bitcoin really paved the way for crypto; there's no denying that.  I don't think that anyone in doge really thinks that dogecoin will be even remotely as big as Bitcoin.  The thing that bothers people like me from is when I log on here to see someone raining on the parade of fun over there.  It's usually someone acting arrogant, and/or ignorant to what we're doing or what we're about.
Bitcoin rocks and I have money here too.  I'm holding on to that as a long term investment, I'm playing with my dogecoin.  I have no doubts that doge will also make me money some time down the road.  I can assure you though, I won't be sad if I lose my doge money because it was hella fun while it lasted.
The more bitcoin I get, the better.  The more dogecoin I get, the funner.

Unfortunately your timeframe is a little off.  In the months after the inception of dogecoin, moolah_ and Moolah, the company, were held in very high regard.  Everyone (just about) seemed to love the guy, and the company.  Then, as things got weird, the community started to question his intent.  Question who he was even (from some senior members).  Unfortunately, a lot of great marketing had taken place and a lot of naive shibes stayed true to their word that moolah_ was a god.  Unfortunately, it's been disproven now.
But, in the early days...  he was (seemingly) solid.  A huge sponsor of all things doge, a hugely positive influence.  Once a few people started to question him, he got nasty.

Haha.  Glad I could brighten your day :)

Moolah actually made a deal with someone in advance to pay the required $55,000 for the amount that we raised.  So it's a done deal as it is, and who knows, the buyer might make money in a few months or couple of years when dogecoin lands on the moon.  Much wow.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:38:37
Nope, still running strong :)

Darn, me is a fool.  I fooled meself in to spending money.  Just like you did in Bitcoin, which has been a rollercoaster of sorts over the past few weeks/months.  Yet, you have probably held on to your investment because you believe in it.
People at dogecoin believe in that currency too, not just that it will go up and people will get rich, but that's it's done amazing things for people all over the world.  Oh, it's also a lot of fun too.  For a very minimal amount of funds, you can actively participate in a community that is POSITIVE and welcoming.  Not bad.
+2 doge
That's my 2 Doge for you
