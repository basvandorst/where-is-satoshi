The paraphrase _is_ your private key

This is an interesting line of thought. What is the philosophical basis for not discarding or ignoring hypocritical viewpoints? I haven't reasoned it out, but my instinct tells me it's OK to ignore them. Am I wrong?

As long as there is an exchange rate for alt coins (no matter how small) they will survive. 
I think eventually we'll see alt coins dominate various domains of use.
 Retailers don't care about denomination since they immediately convert to usd.

I think you are viewing at the pre-sell in the wrong light.
I've been thinking of it more like a kickstarter fundraiser (donation) than an IPO (investment).

They would have to buy up enough BTC to function as a reserve.

I have a framework project I think is vaguely related.
I created a framework by modeling a P/T net, and then adapted the rules to build a sort of token-based state machine.
see:  - I'm imagining this same technique could be used in a variety of scenarios to manage distributed apps or model processes etc...

 They would have to deflate the dollar to match.

nah I think we could just form a bitcoin holding company and then allow cryptographic distribution of the stock.

Although the technologies *are* different - the power comes from the users. Consider that  Bittorrent is both distributed and also centralized, but is recognized as 'trusted/fair'. Imagine rules about sharing/seeding as 'smart contracts'.
Eventually I see bitcoin remaining distributed, but it may not remain decentralized.
We don't  need decentralization for trust. Case in point: I gave my bank credentials when I  signed up for coinbase, which I then use as a trusted API.

This is really the best answer. Without a 'killer app' for smart contracts nobody is motivated to learn or refine the idea for public consumption.

What is the difference between a smart contact and a well defined protocol or API? [ as a developer I don't see much difference ]

Do you think multi-sig is enough? What do we need beyond that?

This guy needs to google fiat currency - disclaimer: I only skimmed though the video - he needs to edit out all the filler words and glances at notecards.  ( Really this seems like a school assignment )
