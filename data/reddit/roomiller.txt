Looks interesting.
It wouldn't be a TERRIBLE idea to prep in case of a crypto holocaust anyway.  
I'll have to read into this a bit more, thanks though.

Until all crypto users realize this, as well as bitcoiners, then we will start to really see crypto hit the mainstream.
sigh, maybe people will start to step outside of their tech bubble and realize the key to getting crypto to work, is to make it so easy granny could use it.

People would be skeptical of such a thing though, you gotta realize this, we are in volatile times still...
And could you blame people for getting skeptical over something they've never heard anything about? I mean think about it, people on Reddit are very very very skeptical, some of the biggest skeptics out there.
Especially around these new pump and dump ICOs.
Having said all that, yes I too have put in a decent amount of my BTC to their project, because rarely do people think about adoption like they should be.
BTC needs to hit mainstream and it does not have it's killer app yet as far as I'm concerned. This could be that app from my research.

You're right, but as they say, 'smoke em if you got em'.

nobody is talking about it because in all reality, we're all a bit worried and uneasy.
a little spook like this could send the market flying in any direction!
truth is:
Nobody knows jack shit!
So grab a nice beer and some popcorn and watch the madness ensue.
I like to have the bitcoin charts up on a dedicated monitor with a high-life and watch the crazy shit unfold.  and have auto f5 on frontpage going
