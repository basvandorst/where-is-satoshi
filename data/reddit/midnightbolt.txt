That is the same question we allways get. "How can I know you won't steal my coins?" This is our answer: We don't store all the info it takes to reassemble the private key. That's one of our strengths. 
I'm very glad you asked this question!
How do we know you're dead? simple: same system as 
With our service, you can select your heirs anonymously too. Heirs don't need to know about eachother nor how much the other heir got from the total value. You can anonymously distribute your wealth as you see fit.
A testament's content is known to all heirs...
Regards and thank you for the questions!

Sorry for the late reply. You are very  very right sir. Wa are going to decentralize this. but you allways have to have an exit/entry point into your decentralised system. Also you have to have someone somewhere creating the software for the decentralized system. that would be us.
We have had contact and shared toughts with the guys from ethereum for example but a this point in time their project is not stable enough to use it for something as important as this. It is promising but not yet there.
So, it IS going to be decentralized.
Thank you for the comment and giving me/us a chance to elaborate the idea. This is exactly the reason why we posted this here. You feedback is invaluable!
