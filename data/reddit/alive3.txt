This is great news, shows a large FTSE company is taking Bitcoin seriously and will allow more people to get exposure who don't have the technical knowledge. No change of getting Goxed with a company this heavily regulated!

Looks good however I think you need to show the buy/sell spread.
Did a quick test on your demo buying $10 worth of coins and then selling the same amount in another tab but only got $9.70 back.
Thats quite a spread

"Further, MtGox Co., Ltd. continues to make efforts to clarify facts as quickly as possible"  -Well that's a lie

Small fish only 4.6 coins. Brought a couple of months ago when they hit $1,000. Never saw more than a couple of % profit.
I'll be back, Bitcoin will only grow

Trading overseas is top expensive, i've given up. The costs involved in moving money abroad is why bitcoin is so important for the future.
Australia is getting cheaper thanks to a couple exchange websites and these market makers.
Seeing the 3% listed somewhere would allow quick comparison to other competitors.

Rumor from where?

Thanks for the prompt reply.
I ask about the spread because I like the idea of no transaction feeds so that the price you click on is what you receive however these fee's can easily be incorporated into the spread. Having the spread visible allows one to see how it compares to other market.
Also, I would like to see if your FAQ a comment about where your prices are from (eg Data feeds from btc-e / bitstamp converted at spot AUD/USD etc).
I like BTCMarkets at the moment as I can see the other side of my trade and know exactly what they make off my trade (0.85%). I'm still unsure with market markets if I can't see the spread.
I'll keep an eye on your website, the more competition the better for everyone!

I've used btcmarkets for about 6 months time now. Great website and best of all you can see market depth. I don't like the other sites like CoinJar where they are market makers - you never know the spread.
With btcmarkets you know you are getting a price another person is willing to sell at.

Shorting is hoping the price will fall. You make money as it falls down as you sell at the current price and buy it back at a lower price.
