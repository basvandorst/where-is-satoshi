Ok as a New York State resident why can’t I use crypto.com’s app or certain apps in general in my state. I’m not operating an exchange I just want to invest using certain apps because they contain crypto’s I can’t get on other exchanges I CAN use. Why punish the resident AND the business that want to operate? It’s really really annoying.
Edit:why down vote I was asking a question?

And yet somehow his coin had a 96% boost in a short period of time. Not saying he’s not a fraud, what I am saying is people will still pump the coin to get profit.

In all seriousness this technology needs to be explained clearly and concisely to the generation coming into the college world, we don’t need wall street or any “professional investment groups” muddying the blockchain name or how the tech works, as soon as young people can get the information they need on this tech the sooner we can advance as a species and civilization.

@_date: 2018-12-20 15:31:50
Ok I agree 100% this should not be happening.
For a company to be able to lobby with its own customers funds should be criminal. 
If taking the power away from companies to lobby would be as simple as storing your btc in your wallet so they can’t use it. That would be TRUE power to the people. Mass exodus of btc out of exchanges or Coinbase would mean massive loss of funds allocated to the lobbying being done. Brilliant.
