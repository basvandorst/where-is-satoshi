Buffet also missed the dot com boom. Something he admitted was a mistake. He said similar things about it too during that boom

Half my friends in the sidelines who missed the pump are asking me if this is the dip they should buy and the other half with BTC are asking me if they should sell in case it goes lower. I set up a slack channel and had them talk to each other. Oh too bad you can't post screenshots on replies but the fomo/fud tornado is insane. Most of these people missed the great fomo of 2017 and the following bear market. So really weak hands. Same people buying, regretting, selling, repeat. �� And if course to be honest, I was like them last year ��. Sone lessons you only learn the hard way.

It's a bull market, you're fine. Give it a week tops

The truth is I'm not. We went parabolic and needed to cool off with a healthy retrace. We backed 50% and bounced to the .612  and came down back down. Even if we break 10.5k we have some support at 9700 range. If we break that I'll pull out and wait and see if this was indeed a b wave bull trap. In layman's terms. Undoing all those gains and supports we have is going to take some serious crap like Bitcoin being hacked or a major exchange going insolvent. "Queues Tether fudsters"

Be careful he might sue you... Unless you apologies in an open court with a prepared script.

Just be grateful it's only 1BTC and not your whole wallet. Your biggest problem is this is a cold wallet with no OFFICIAL connection to the exchange besides what you dug up. I wish you luck and will be following your journey.
