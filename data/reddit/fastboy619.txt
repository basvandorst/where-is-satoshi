Hey guys,
During the last couple of months, I’ve been at work, developing a new platform. BitBuku represents a newly established online bitcoin casino, meant to take the gambling experience of its users to a whole new level.
I designed the casino in such a way, so that it’ll be a fun, and easy to play card game. The rules are simple, thus contributing to the overall fun experience.
With this in mind, once the game starts, players are asked to pick a card number, from 1 to K, including A. After both players make their choices, the system proceeds to distribute cards to the players from a new pack. The player who gets his card first, wins the amount that has been betted.
Perhaps one of the best parts about the casino is that it is made solely for players. This means that there is no house or bot that can have an advantage. The result of each game depends solely on the card chosen, and of course, the luck of the two players involved.
To make things a little more fun, the game allows players to choose how much they wish to bet, alongside with their rank. Profits also range from 90% to 99.9%, with very low fees, whereas the chances of winning are of 50/50.
In case you’re wondering about the withdrawal and deposit rules, they’re simple. You just need one  three confirmations before you’ll be free to use the funds however you’d like.
So, what are you waiting for? If I’ve convinced you, head over to
