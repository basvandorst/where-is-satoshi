Hey Maybe we should change the meme
Bitcoin...To the Moons!
@_date: 2017-07-09 03:43:56
Perhaps we can call your condition, coinstipation?

Bravo! Good rhyme. Especially chode. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-09 03:05:58
Ha! 
Be careful though, too much pushing is problematic. :(
@_date: 2017-07-09 03:03:04
RapKu, What the hell, why not! :)
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:26:15
It's stylized haiku, but your reading it as a poem works for me. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:02:49
A haiku just for you, TT. ;)

Yep, your version works nicely. Thanks for commenting. :)

@_date: 2017-07-15 17:18:08
Makes some sense, but would he be buying now, or selling? Or neither?
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:16:28
Not exactly what I had in mind, but I appreciate your perspective. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:16:22
Dogecoin despots? ETH crypto-fascists?  Fiat loving finks? Maxcoin maximalists?!?
Grrr... ;)
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:14:26
I like your Shakespearean last line! :) 
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:33:01
Got it. You think current price levels = buy. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:37:45
That's a haipoo! ;)
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:53:37
...to boldly go where no one has gone before. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:14:22
Like bitcoin, my haiku break the rules. :)
Plus, there are different schools of thought on the subject.
Thanks for your comment!
