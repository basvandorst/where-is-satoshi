I mean, after watching it 10 times I realize you can see his hand "pull open a door" but there's just and empty hand with no door at all.  That's got to be the first, and biggest giveaway that it's fake, and that's at 3 seconds into the video.

I've been playing the "sit and wait until items aren't overstocked on tf2wh" game.  Then having to go to tf2whx and deal with selling the tf2wh currency for bitcoin, where they take a portion of every 1k credits sold on top of the profit they make from the buy/sell price gap on items.
Guess I can skip the bullshit with this.

Have known of bitcoins for a while now, yet just got into them a day or two ago and am in the process of trying to acquire some (waiting for bank verification so I can buy on coinbase). Happy to answer any questions

Digging through the sidebar can yield good results!

The thing that turns me away from this subreddit is when I see people acting like "X Business" is obligated to start accepting btc because someone who uses it also uses bitcoins.  To me, it just seems like it's counterproductive to add in a step of currency conversion and de-conversion just so you can say "oooh i used bitcoins yay."  More or less, it's just the people who act like their on a mission to convert people in places where it's not necessary.  I like to view bitcoin as useful in certain scenarios rather than a replacement/alternative for modern currencies.
