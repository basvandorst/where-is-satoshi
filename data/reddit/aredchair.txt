Just use an exchange.. quadriga let’s you wire up to 500k

True but any large seller with charge you about 4% anyways for convenience. A lot of people purchasing large amount are tossing it in ATMs. May not be OPs case but sellers don’t care, you’ll be paying markup regardless

Changelly is a garbage exchange which should be avoided regardless

Fair enough, it’s just kind of pointless to have about 17 posts a day about price predictions for 2018 that have basically no merit behind them and it’s just someone spouting numbers.

Lmao chill out

When will you all learn, predictions mean absolutely nothing. These posts are all the same shit with different numbers lmfao
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:20:24
Of course not, that would be stupid of me considering there’s been a prediction of every price point. Someone will be right. All I’m saying is there is no point posting these articles claiming any price.
