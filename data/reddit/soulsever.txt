Not in general. I think there's a lot of smug hodlers right now thinking that they have a crystal ball

My understanding is that a wall is a sell order that is big enough to hold the price of bitcoin for a significant amount of time. Essentialy the price on a certain exchange cannot go up until the sell order is filled. Meaning if someone wants to sell 1000 bitcoins at 17k, the price will stay at 17k until all of the 1000 are sold. And while those are selling, others may add more sell orders as well.

It's basically an attack on bitcoin. What you need to know is that after the fork, there will be a divide between the miners on what protocol (segway or segway2x) to use and the they (the miners) will have some sway in the value of each coin but ultimately it lies in the hands of all the users of bitcoin to pick which one is adopted as the real BTC. If you believe in bitcoin or don't care enough to inform yourself on what exactly 2X is then my advice is to do nothing and just hold what you have. 
I am also very new to bitcoin but this is my understanding of the 2x fork

Although your explanation is helpful it is still a little over my head. My understanding is that it is good to buy before the split and store on a hardware wallet? Where would I buy such a wallet?

Bitcoin is a reward for verification of the blockchain, is my understanding
