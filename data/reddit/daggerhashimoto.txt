I'm not sure why we are trying to retrofit a cow with rocket boosters. Leave the cow to give you milk and let the rocket boost a fuselage.  Bitcoin for currency and ethereum for smart contract execution. It was designed for it. How is rootstock going to deal with 10 minute blocks while ethereum blocks are in seconds?   I really wanna know.  
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:22:17
I'm just going to do one... kay?? Aint got time to spoon feed you shit!


Thats because Rovion had access to their network! For weeks, months! Have you worked at a place where they use computers??? okay.... let me help you. You get a username, to login to shit! that username is usually your first letter of your first name, and your last name! So, if your name was Abdul Retardberg, your username would be aretardberg. sometimes you only get 7 characters, so you'd be aretard

If you think I'm stupid, then you're really stupid. My point is, I don't like coinbase as a spectator. I have nothing to do with the US or Iran. Imagine me in Iceland.

I KNOW for a FACT that Russia/Putin actually loves BTC even though he might pretend he doesn't or we hear that he doesn't. Do you know how I know?  RT.  They talk about crypto all the fucking time! not on just one show, but many shows! and it's almost always positive! and we all know that RT is a state news channel. IF they didn't like BTC, they would be told to STFU about bitcoin. Plain and simple.

Thanks for the put-down. 
I'm not gung-ho about anything. I was all for the increase, even-though, I don't fully trust Gavin CIA Andresen, I was like sure! sounds like a good idea. After listening both arguments presented by Gavin and Peter, and listening to the debate, i have flipped my position 180. I'm going to support the actual core-devs. Is that ok with you?
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:03:04
Gavin  is pushing hard for it, but several core devs disagree and for good reasons. Please listen to the podcast to get a better understanding. 
Also, keep in mind, we know for a fact that Gavin has spoken with boys and the C1A, so right there i can't fully trust Gavin. Lets not forget what covert actions mean.

Thats what happens when a person gets to hear the other side of the argument. Gavin is the one posting about block increase every week on his blog which ends up on my front page. It was good for me to hear Peter's position!

1. The email is the one used by Satoshi to announce Bitcoin in the first place. 
2. The email was not spoofed, it actually originated from vistomail's server. The email headers show the email originated from 190.97.163.93 and the SPF records show this as an authorised sender for the email. This does not prove the account wasn't hacked of course, or that the account might have expired and be re-registered by someone else (vistomail is a paid for email provider).
3. While the email is not signed, and there are a number of PGP keys listed on key servers for him (to vary addresses), he didnt sign any emails with any PGP keys.
It is therefore not possible to outright dismiss the email's authenticity as the email originates from an authentic source. The only questions is whether the webmail service was hacked or commandeered somehow.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:23:10

NO such thing! 
From the mailing list:
Something I only recently realised is that Satoshi's apparent policy(1)
of never making any cryptographically secure signatures to link together
his posts - or indeed any communication at all - fits well with the
avoidance of creating a central authority figure. Currently every single
thing Satoshi ever apparently wrote can only be linked together by
trusting third parties - email archives could have been hacked,
bitcointalk might have fake messages, etc. Obviously in practice we have
reasonable assurance that the same person or group was behind most of
the messages we now consider to be "from Satoshi", but ultimately
strictly speaking we can only take each message individually, for the
arguments contained within.
As you've often said, the biggest achievement by Satoshi in the creation
of Bitcoin was to create a system where the identity of the creator is a
mere historical footnote. We can probably go further, and state that
while doing so, Satoshi quite counter-intuitively took steps to avoid
even creating a pseudoanonymous identity.

 To avoid such discussions.
You seem to be assuming that there is specific reason to believe the
message is unauthentic.  This is not the case.
Contrary to other poster's claims, if the message had been PGP signed
that might, in fact, have arguably been weak evidence that it was
unauthentic: no message from the system's creator that I (or
apparently anyone) was aware of was ever signed with that key.
The headers on the message check out.  The mail server in question is
also not an open relay.  At the moment the only reason I have to doubt
the authenticity of it is merely the fact that it exists after so much
air silence, but that isn't especially strong.
In the presence of doubt, it's better to take it just for its content.
And on that front it is more on-topic, civil, and productively
directed than a substantial fraction of new messages on the list.  I
certainly do not see a reason to hide it.
A focus on the content is especially relevant because one of the core
messages in the content is a request to eschew arguments from
authority; which is perhaps the greatest challenge here: How can the
founder of a system speak up to ask people to reject that kind of
argument without implicitly endorsing that approach through their own
This whole tangest is a waste of time.  If you believe the message is
unauthentic or not the best response is the same as if it is
authentic. Focus on the content. If its worth responding to, do. If
it's not don't. Then move on with life.

firstly you're on secondly, litecoin has a different POW, scrypt, which was supposed to make it ASIC resistant. But, as we all know, there are scrypt ASICS out there now, so there goes that advantage. Right now, the network effect of bitcoin is by far the best. Litecoin doesn't have anything to offer. If this thing take off, it will be bitcoin.

Great news folks, 
I'd like to point out, that most of the people sampled on that, no offense, don't have a lot of coins and are probably not as versed when it comes to crypto. (they are using coinbase)
I suspect that Bit-Rich folks (people with hundreds and thousands of coins) have been in the scene long enough to understand which side is the clown-fest, and which side is the side that has the people's interest in mind. And they are the one who will decide which side of their coins they are going to dump. :D   I'm so not worried

Here is my recomendation. Not sure how tech savvy you are, so hope this helps. 
go to    
it's an opensource bip39 generator. 
file&gt; save page as:&gt; save HTML  to a USB disk. 
use a live Linux CD (google how to use live linux cd)  and when you get to the desktop, plug your usb in
Do not connect to Wifi! Do not plug cable in. 
Open the file you saved on your USB dirve and it should launch a browser and you'll see the webpage. 
Now, on that webpage: 
Number of words: pick 12. or larger if it makes you feel safer, but 12 is as safe as it really gets. 
BIP39 Passphrase (optional): leave it blank, or put a password THAT YOU KNOW YOU WILL NEVER EVER FORGET! 
coin pick bitcoin
Hit generate random. 
**WRITE DOWN THE 12 WORDS** AND **REMEMBER THE PASSWORD IF YOU PICKED ON**
with this info, you can generate unlimited number of addresses for not just bitcoin, but shit ton of other coins.  scroll down you'll see the first 20 or so addresses it generated. Pick the first one! there is your public address, public key, and private key. I hope you know what those things are. 
cheers.

One more thing. Propagation and validation time. Bigger blocks make it so when a block is found, it takes much longer to propagate through the planet and much longer to validate. So, if you are a big miner in china, *coughBITMAINcough*, with multiple mining pools,  you have a much bigger head start on building on top of your block. The closer you are to the center of mining power, the faster you can get the blocks, validate, and start mining on top of it. 
This exasperates the mining centralization problem. Smaller miners farther away from china will have their chances of finding blocks  reduced dramatically and they will be priced out. More centralization.

I'm sorry if you're not a shill and I was rude. I'll try to answer your questions as best I can. 


I'd like to know how you came up with that? Is that something you read on Because that couldn't possibly be more wrong.  
1. The mining problem aka the "difficulty" adjusts every 2 weeks. Here is a [graph]( and it has absolutely nothing to do with the size of the blocks 
2. Quantum computers are not good when it comes to hashing, which is what the mining algo is for bitcoin, [sha256]( The blocksize is the amount of transactions that can be put in a block. They are completely unrelated. 


several reasons: 
1.They have been trying to take over bitcoin development for several years. See BitcoinXT, BitcoinClassic, BitcoinUnlimited. 
2. bigger blocksize take longer to propagate on the network and thats bad for small miners and good for big miners! Lets say Im miner A and i own 35% of the hashing power and you're miner B with 10%. Miner A finds a block and it broadcasts it out and immediately starts mining on top of it.  Miner B is on the other side of the planet. It will take longer for the block to get it, and when it does, it has to verify all the transactions. Blocks are at 1MB atm, you might think for a 2MB block it takes twice as long to verify but thats not correct. It takes much longer. All of this makes it so all the big miners and their friends that are geographically closer to each other, have a much better chance of finding blocks and it will get worse as time goes on because it will push out the other miners from being profitable. Next thing you know, we have two miners left. 
worried about Quantum? 
enjoy this song.

@_date: 2017-07-27 18:29:53
correct. Geography will always play a part, it does today. The closer you are to the place where most of the blocks are mined, the faster you get them. But the bigger the block, the more of problem it becomes.
