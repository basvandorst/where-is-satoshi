20MB blocks were well tested by Gavin.


All changes are. 


Segwit is better for transaction malleability. It still allows for a situation where more transactions are being generated than will fit in the blockchain. 


As with any change. 


It appears to me that miners are afraid to move away or have some strange loyalty to core.


Now now.

That depends on the activation criteria. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:12:55


Bitcoin has hard forked before.


A soft fork still needs a majority to upgrade. Those that don't could produce invalid blocks so it's still in your interests to update following a soft fork update. Also those that don't update may not be fully validating blocks.


This point is not confined to just hard forks.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:56:06
Ok, so for a given block size increase how much does centralisation increase?

Decker is self contradictory. He claims that based on an analysis from 3 years ago 16MB blocks would be ok. Then they go on to say a 10MB block will take longer than 10 minutes to propagate and is therefore too big.
BitFury's analysis is flawed. I only got as far as page 4 and found it assumes all blocks are full 24 hours a day 365 days a year. And this:


Is this a joke? I have a 20Mb/s connection and that is the slowest speed my isp does. Even my mobile phone's data connection is faster than that.
And also I don't see anywhere where it says how many nodes are required for a healthy bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:28:13


Why? The transaction will be valid on both forks (as long as they haven't diverged too far). We're not talking about another altcoin, these forks will still be on the same network. Therefore the bitcoin nodes on the old and new forks will still be sharing transactions with each other.
Additionally it could be within the miners interest to attempt to mine both forks and copy transactions from 1 fork to the other to pickup the tx fees on both forks.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:42:59
When do you expect this to happen. Would a GB growth per day be a problem at that point?

I don't think you really understand how engineering works. Every design has compromises and tradeoffs. The 51% attack was accepted as a tradeoff to achieve the other design goals of bitcoin. 
What you're asking for means going back to the drawing board and starting again. And in order you achieve a coin without a 51% attack you will likely have to drop some of the qualities of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:47:08


Good for smaller miners
Is block propagation speed currently a problem?


Is block validation speed currently a problem?


By how much?


Is disk space currently a problem?


If the rate of new transactions is greater than the rate at which transactions can fit in the blockchain then there will be transactions that never confirm. This is not acceptable.


If it's not on chain it didn't happen.

– can be transported over a communications channel

They are not fit to lead bitcoin. Look at the scaling debate. People started saying we're going to have a problem because blocks are growing and going to hit the max limit. Core said, don't worry we have plenty of time. Gavin went off and worked on a solution. When he proposed it core said, no, it wasn't designed by us so no.
What they should have don't is accepted it and then worked on further solutions if they felt it was required. Instead they rejected it and instead of designing a solution they said, let's invite *more* people in on finding a solution. Everyone knows this is far slower. Let's have 2 large conferences on trying to work out a solution that still a lot of people do not agree with (but consensus only matters when we say it does).
They are show to act, inconsistent, many appear to have a conflict of interest and many appear to be software coders but not engineers. They are very risk averse which makes they unable to make decisions or make bad decisions.

@_date: 2015-06-02 05:44:30
I agree with everything you said but in order to independently transfer coins on both forks you 1st need to perform a double spend.
Otherwise you have the same utxos available on both forks. Any transaction you create will be valid on both forks. Without the double spend anyone could (at anytime) take a transaction that had been mined on 1 fork and send it to the other fork. In fact it doesn't even need this manual action as both forks are on the same network and still sending each other transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:29:39
So if a change is implemented as a hard fork is could be a controversial change. But a change implemented as a soft fork can not be a controversial change? Come on, you know that's rubbish.

It's 8MB. Where has 8GB come from? You will not be downloading 8MB every 10 minutes. 8MB is the maximum size. You can only fill a block up to the number of pending transactions. We have a 1MB limit now but every block is not 1MB. Also with headers first you will only download the transactions in the block that you haven't already seen.

I never said it was better. It solves a different problem to bitcoin. Ripple is not about xrp (and xrp could never have increased much in value anyways).
Ripple would allow you to transfer fiat currencies as if they were cryptocurrencies with no more risk than a bitcoin exchange.
Imagine friends/family that are not comfortable about sending their bank details to an exchange. You could be a ripple gateway for them. 
They'd give you GBP in cash and you'd give them GBP on ripple (and vice versa). As long as you maintain a positive balance at a gateway your friends/family could use the ripple GBP. 
It could even be an easy way to buy bitcoins. Your friends/family, using you as a gateway, could then buy bitcoins on the ripple network and send them to their own bitcoin wallet via any existing bitcoin gateway.

@_date: 2014-10-24 22:12:43
Yes. With a 2 of 3 signature the escrow would have to collude with the other party to steal your coins so it's important that they are independent. But if both parties are happy with whatever agreement/transaction they are conducting they can work together to complete the transaction without involving the escrow.

I'm not saying we shouldn't try to help people understand. But why not help them do the right thing from the start. Use a new address for each transaction and if you are using a non-deterministic wallet always backup at least every 100 transactions? Do you think that is too hard to understand?

For large amounts I'd always recommend a brain wallet (from diceware). Make it into a paper wallet. Also encrypt and store online.

From the original paper.  
However using an explicit prunable OP_RETURN output to store the pubkey
rather than re-using one from a txin or txin signature has a number of
1) The txin's owned by the payor are not revealed to the payee. In fact,
   they could be held by a third-party who simply makes a transaction
   with the appropriate txouts on behalf of the payee.
2) Less information about the txouts is leaked. The statistical
   distribution of txouts remains unchanged - not possible in re-use
   schemes because they need to grind the payee scriptPubKey's for the
   sake of the prefix filters.
3) If required the nonce secret can be revealed to prove that a payment
   was made to a third-party, e.g. for dispute resolution.

Just wait until your transaction is 6 or more confirmations deep.


This is true, but if you're crafting a transaction for the purpose of creating 1 of these address aliases you could make sure the transaction only has 1 output.

No, I understand that. I wasn't calling you out as fake and requesting additional information. My point was that evidence of a transaction does not prove this story.
I have seen occasions where people think a transaction provides proof and this appears to be 1.
Anyone could have looked through the blockchain and found a similar transaction. It doesn't prove you own either of the addresses or that 1 is a paper wallet where the address does not match the private key.
Anyways, good to see you got it sorted.

I wouldn't go with an nlockedtimed transaction. I would create a brainwallet. Randomly generated (not generated from your brain) but memorizable (have a look at diceware). Optionally create paper wallets (with the brain wallet keys) and you should probably bip38 encrypt them if you do. 
You could also use the brain wallet to create a n-of-m multisig address and then put the keys on paper. That way you would need n of the m paper wallets (or the brain wallet) to find the key.

@_date: 2014-09-15 07:17:28
This is an entirely personal choice. It depends on how many coins we're talking about and whether you consider that a lot. It also depends on your view of risk  The probability of you losing your keys or stolen from you versus the probability of coinbase being shutdown, hacked or running with your money.
And remember, you don't have to keep all your coins in 1 place.

Depends how you generate the wallet.

The only thing this could be useful for is your own cold storage. 
So move your coins so they are all on the same address. Make an nlocktime transaction to move your coins to a new address at sometime in the future. Put this transaction and the private key of the new address the coins will move to in a safe place. Delete the private key of the address the coins are currently on. I think that is the closest you can get to what you want without a payment processor like paypal. 
(I'm not sure if nlocktime transactions are currently enabled)

Part of the problem is that taking something that is very complicated and explaining it in simple layman's terms is a difficult skill and not everyone can do it. 
From the point of view someone using bitcoin is basically digital coins/tokens that can not be copied and can be stored on computers/mobile devices and sent from anywhere to anywhere. 
But everyone knows you can not stop someone from copying a file. As bitcoin is software that raises the obvious question - how? How can bitcoins not be copied? To understand the answer to this question requires an almost complete understanding of how bitcoin works.

Once you import or sweep a paper wallet private key into a wallet app, scrumple up the paper wallet and throw it away. You have given the app permission to manage the coins on that address.

This article was written over a year ago. I think asics only started appearing around that time. In any case there are a lot more asics now than there were then and these are a lot more energy efficient. Does that mean the whole bitcoin network uses less or does it mean more asics join the network and the consumption remains about the same? I don't know but I've seen a lot of estimates of how much energy is used. 
But why is the focus on energy usage and not energy generation? Shouldn't we be looking more at hydro/tidal/nuclear power generation?






Consider this payment for processing bitcoin transactions. Without miners bitcoin does not work. 
Also a lot of engineering advancements have come from scientific research which at the time had no reason for the research other than science itself.

There is no vote as such. If there is an update to the mining software that will cause a fork, you choose to update or not.

It doesn't even matter which pool you mine in. The amount you make will be proportional to the ratio of your hash rate to the total network hash rate.

1 billion people start creating addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second without producing any duplicates.
In order for me to have a 1 in 1 billion chance of randomly creating a collision they would have had to have created 1 billionth of all the address.
There are 2^160 addresses. 1 billionth of this is 2^160 / (10^9 ).
Time to create this 1 billionth of all addresses is 2^160 / (10^9 )/60/60/24/356 = 4.6*10^13 years.
So 1 billion people creating addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second will take 46344 billion years before they even have a 1 billion to 1 chance of creating a collision.

The only part of stealth addresses that I don't yet understand is, how do I find in the blockchain a transaction that has been sent to my stealth address. 
I know you could check the nonce in every transaction to see if it produces the private key that is required but that sounds very processor intensive. 
The stealth address paper talked about a prefix. How is this prefix communicated to the sender? 
Edit: should have read on before posting but I still don't understand how the prefix is communicated to the sender.

Alice wants to send money to Bob. 
Bob generates a private/public key pair (b/B).
Alice generates a private/public key pair (a/A).
Bob sends his public key, B (this is his stealth address) to Alice.
Now by the magic of ECC Alice's private key multiple by Bob's public key is equal to Bob's private key multiplied by Alice's public key. This is their shared secret. 
s = aB = bA
Alice takes Bob's public key and multiples it by the shared secret to find a new public key which she then hashes to a normal bitcoin address. This is the address she will send the money to. 
Address = hash160(sB)
Again, by the magic of ECC the private key to this address is Bob's private key multiple by the shared secret. 
Private key = sb
You might have noticed that Alice never sent her public key (sometimes called the nonce in the context of stealth addresses) to Bob. Alice includes her public key in the op_return data of the transaction she sent. 
Alice's private key can be used if she needs to show proof of the transaction to a 3rd party.

Didn't a majority of people vote for a government that decided it was a good idea?
Let me ask you. How would you fund said public services?
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:07:09
I though I did, but i've been unable to.
I started with 3 testnet addresses with the following public keys.
    Pub key 1: 0368d0e4fee21c8e507e0f461d8c8f6c5d2599b2cad0ff0db20e56575df3cf51e4
    Pub key 2: 02bbfe71b392d9ae7ae4eb163369372735eeb3d3c3c014652cd07abd934d5e3631
    Pub key 3: 0260d3335d40cc691f9ef1811e215ea8b6a8467211de4716c90e1fe4344ee64117
I then built the following redemption script:
    52210260d3335d40cc691f9ef1811e215ea8b6a8467211de4716c90e1fe4344ee641172102bbfe71b392d9ae7ae4eb163369372735eeb3d3c3c014652cd07abd934d5e3631210368d0e4fee21c8e507e0f461d8c8f6c5d2599b2cad0ff0db20e56575df3cf51e453ae
Which has the address: 2NFkSiye9A7cdE55A15Cvi8Q2Ad9cdTq34S
I then sent ฿1 to this address. 
TxID: b4f9f584daf70d6407747a135d562f4550436a52e10778446b6d5ce4af08927e
All good so far.
I then tried to create a transaction from that address using this site  (making sure to select testnet).
I enter the Redemption Script and it shows the correct address. The problem appears to be that it can not find the transaction inputs. 
After clicking edit inputs it gives me the options:
BitEasy: 
Blockchain.info: 
Bitcoin Block Explorer 
Does this mean that it's looking for a testnet transaction on mainnet?
I think I have all the information required to create this transaction - just can't do it.

Don't worry. I did the same thing. The trick is to buy more while the price is lower (only what you can afford to lose). This brings down your average buy in price. The price is now well above that 1st buy that I made.

IPV6 doesn't mean you *have* to have 1 constant IP address. It means you *can* have a constant ip address.

And if your government sees a transaction from an unregistered ip address and unregistered bitcoin address there's nothing to say that transaction didn't originate from overseas.

An interesting idea for paper wallets. 
Using a 2-of-3 multisig address make a paper wallet with key 1 and bip 38 encrypted key 2. 
Make a 2nd paper wallet with the bip 38 encrypted key 2 and key 3 then give to a next of kin or other relative (best to not store them in the same location).
If a paper wallet is lost you can still use either because you know the paraphrase. If either are stolen the coins are still safe. When you die the 2 paper wallets (keys 1 &amp; 3) can be used to move the coins.

Therefore when you import the private key from the paper wallet you should consider the coins as having moved from the paper wallet to the wallet app and throw the paper wallet away. 
If you want some of the coins to remain on a paper wallet create a new 1. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:25:41


Agreed. 


I don't follow your logic. 
If you fix all wallet apps so that it is very obvious whether you're sending money to your wallet or sending money to an address in your wallets address book then it would stop these accidents. 
If the core issue is not with the wallet this suggests you could apply a fix to somewhere other than the wallet apps. How would you expect the bitcoin  protocol to know which address you intended to send money to instead of the 1 you told it to send the money to?
@_date: 2014-10-12 07:10:23
Because of the confusion it would cause between old bitcoins and new bitcoins. It's also a "fix" that you'd have to repeat as the value of bitcoin increases. The si prefixes were designed for this. Why not use them?

I'm not suggesting any wrong doing. I am simply questioning the  statement from that


@_date: 2014-09-17 21:11:20
Interesting. I'll get you started.
1st I think the method you're referring to is:
Roll 5 dice 12 times.
Use diceware to convert to 12 words (this is 155 bits of entropy).
Private key = Sha256(12 words).
From [bip32]( 
Calculate I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = "Bitcoin seed", Data = 12 words)
Split I into two 32-byte sequences, IL and IR.
Use parse256(IL) as master secret key, and IR as master chain code.
But if I were doing this by hand I wouldn't bother with the sha256.
Instead roll the dice 99 times (255.9 bits of entropy) or you could go with 62 rolls (160.2 bits of entropy) - record the results.
Take 1 of each number and now you have a very large base 6 number. Convert to base 10 and this is the private key you are going to feed into the elliptic curve equations.
When you want to import the private key, convert to base 16 (is convert the correct word when it is just a different representation of the same number? Anyways). Follow [this guide]( to find the wif that can be imported into a wallet.
The public key is calculated as Q_A = d_A x G.
See here 
And for elliptic curve multiplication see here 
To make this HD you have to start calculating hashes by hand.

Not on android it wasn't. 


Can be done on an offline computer. 


True, but you can not eliminate all risks. Only manage them. You could generate your private key twice and compare the results to mitigate this risk. 


That is 1 method but RNGs have failed before. See android.

It wouldn't be very hard to make an NFC bitcoin card. You pay bitcoins to a hosted wallet which tops up your NFC card and can be used with a single tap.

A bitcoin wallet does not have an id. It is simply a collection of private keys/address pairs. Your wallet will record every private key/address you use. The private key is used for spending. You don't really need to know about private keys as your wallet will manage them for you. The "id" you are referring to is your address. You should use a new address for every transaction.

Point 1 may be optional. It depends on your level of paranoia and the amount of money involved. 
How did you create your passphrase?
Point 3 is optional but does not compromise security (unless someone gets access to your blockchain.info account, finds out you're loaded and comes to beat you for the passphrase).




Your private key is sha256(passphrase). This private key could then be converted into a format that multiple wallet apps can read (wif for example). Electrum uses it's own deterministic wallet format though so your passphrase will not work. Unless electrum provides a sweep function that will accept a wif private key, it might not be usable with electrum at all. 
But all you'd have to do is sweep the paper/brain wallet with mycelium (android) and then send the coins to your electrum wallet address.

Do most people care why? Maybe the reasons should be on the FAQ page and a "more info" link from the warning. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 09:02:32
I've seen this said before and not convinced it's true. The reason is that without finding the address from the private key you don't know which address the private key maps to. Therefore you do not know which private keys you can skip. It would be possible to select 2^160 private keys at random and not 1 of them give you the address you're interested in. 
Also this is a probability problem. If you were looking for 1 private key out of 2^256 you would have to try all 2^256 keys to have a 100% probability of finding it. For a 50% probability you only need to try half of them 2^255. 
But as you have pointed out there are "only" 2^160 addresses. 
This means there are on average 2^256 /2^160 private keys per address. 2^105 . Assuming an even distribution of private keys to addresses. I'm not even sure this is a good assumption. There could be addresses with only 1 private key (there are addresses with 0 private keys). There could be addresses with many more than 2^105 keys. 
But let's just go with 2^105 as the average. To find any of 2^105 out of 2^256 in 1 go the probability is 2^105 /2^256. After 2 tries it's 2^105 /2^256 + 2^105 /2^255. 
I'm going to leave this here as I'm at work at the minute.

If i have £1000 to spend and ฿1 is £1 I can buy ฿1000. If the exchange rate goes up by £1 so ฿1 is ฿2, I now have £2000.
If i have £1000 to spend and ฿1 is £1000 I can buy ฿1. If the exchange rate goes up by £1 so ฿1 is ฿1001, I now have £1001.

None. Both MD5 and SHA1 hashing functions have been found to be broken. ECC appears to be better than RSA. 
Cryptography isn't really about making something impossible. It's about making something so extremely improbable over some time frame. So that by the time it is brute forced, the information is no longer relevant. 
Bitcoin uses elliptical curve cryptography. If you are really interested in the maths Google ECC ecdsa. 
You might also be interpreted in Diffie–Hellman. Also have a look at RSA and ECDH. 
As for the core bitcoin, the only relevant cryptographic functions are SHA256 (for hashing blocks), RIPEMD-160 (used with SHA256 to hash a public key into an address) and ECDSA to sign a transaction. 
In addition bip32 uses addition of points on an eliptic curve. 
And stealth addresses use ECDH to produce a shared secret.

Because hard forks are usually backwards compatable but not forward  compatable. Meaning the new version will accept the old blocks. But the new version could create blocks that the old version will not accept.

I think things are rarely that black and white but it is a very interesting moral point you bring up. Is the need to punish, part of the human desire to seek revenge? To make someone feel the pain they made someone else feel? Our brains are flawed in so many ways. I think you have made an assumption that the behavior correcting method world be painless and not considered  punishment in itself. 
Your question could almost be reworded to, if we could painlessly correct someone's criminal behaviour such that they never reoffend shouldn't we also get some revenge on them?
Here's another 1 for you. Assuming your situation - painless rehab with 99.9% success rate. What if further punishment caused them to rebel and reduced that rate to about 10%?

No. Don't worry about that. You're here now. 
Bitcoin core requires that you download and validate the whole blockchain. That can take a long time (we're taking days). There are "thin" (spv) wallets that do not require the whole blockchain. 
I don't know what you'd make from mining but even with an awesome computer don't expect to make much. You might even find the cost of electricity to keep it running is more than you make. There are now a lot of asics on the network which are much faster and efficient. The amount you make will also decrease as the network hash rate increases.

An address is
    base58(0x00 hash(0x04 pub-key) checksum)
The part of an address that makes it into a transaction is 
    hash(0x04 pub-key)
Therefore if your wallet did not check the checksum it could still create and send a transaction paying to hash(0x04 pub-key). This is a valid transaction and miners do not check the address checksum - they can't because it's not part of the transaction.

Bitcoin onto Coinbase, and Coinbase sends back to Dell dollars. Then Coinbase takes this Bitcoin and sells it onto the market.


I'm not convinced by this argument because if I have bitcoins and want to buy a computer my options are
1. Sell bitcoin buy computer
2. Buy computer with bitcoins
Same net effect as 1.
3. But computer with bitcoins and buy (or rebuy bitcoins). 
My point is that if someone is using bitcoins to buy something chances are they would have sold bitcoins anyways or are rebuying them. 


Can I go to dell, spend bitcoins and get a computer?
Yes. 
Then they accept bitcoins. What they do with those bitcoins isn't really your concern. 
No they accept credit/debit cards? No. Visa and MasterCard do then send a bank transfer to Dell. So they only accept bank transfers. See how silly this argument is?
What about a multinational that accepts multiple currencies? What of they manage the exchange rate risk by converting a large bulk of their profits to 1 or just a few currencies. Do they really accept all those currencies. It's just a silly argument.

The best way to prevent losing any money is to destroy the paper wallet after importing it. It's no longer cold storage at that point anyways. 
The problem you're referring to is:
1. Import private key from a paper wallet into a wallet app. 
2. Spend some of the money on the paper wallet. 
3. Assume the rest is still on the paper wallet. 
4. Delete the wallet app along with all it's private keys. 
Point 3 is a bad assumption and will cause you to lose money. Step 2 could have sent change to a change address for which the private key is only known by the wallet app.

I don't feel a need to cater to those people. 


Ok, I can see this is a bit unfortunate but context is everything. The meaning will probably be quite obvious 99% of the time from the context. 


Only if you get your units for internet *speed* (which is a rate) wrong, Ie 10 megabits per second. Also as internet speed goes up mega, giga and bitcoin units are more likely to go the other way milli, micro again it shouldn't cause too much confusion when in context.

No. You are discarding the longest chain. That requires a hard fork. 
I could fork my own bitcoin blockchain right now, but as it's not the longest it would just be ignored by the rest of the network. And being the only person using my own personal fork isn't very useful. 
You can do it with any amount of hash power (well, with enough to find a block hash at the current difficulty in a reasonable amount of time at least, or as you are already hard forking you could drop the difficulty if you can't get enough miners onboard quickly enough). 
But for your new chain to be of any use you would need people to support it. How many, I don't know. That's not really a technical question on the bitcoin  protocol.

Alternatively you can memorise the 12 work passphrase from electrum or armory. Or you could use a key stretching function to turn a passphrase into a bip 32 extended master private key. Easy to remember and doesn't require storing anything in the blockchain.

If you are a miner your mining reward could be reversed by the attacker causing your block to be orphaned.

No. It is simply a 2 of 3 multisig address.
Start by taking 3 random 256 bit numbers (aka private keys). In this case:
Lets call these key1, key2 and key3 respectively.
Now find the public key for these private keys.
1 way of doing this is using  (press skip and then Validate or Decrypt) feed it these private keys to get the public keys.
(I don't know why I did this but for keys 1 &amp; 2 I used the compressed public keys and for key 3 I used the non compressed public key).
This gives:
    Key1
    Private key (hex): ad0713e57fde8614cfb6b4ee29cef6b38ae03995784b321215e99e9e197b9703
    Public key (compressed): 020FE06F761D649C4DE182BBC2D6BC529A6472DC30DF1814430E016F4A914B8E77
    Key2
    Private key (hex): aa2f7238923d0377b7576f94dc18f96d53b4696abd185a4b85285201ec9ac2c1
    Public key (compressed): 03902170399721537A6BB27D978B22A8E6C86C4AB87B4E71B1AFF4EDC67C436A74
    Key3 
    Private key (hex): 1be0c766fa5b4677ad4f0a525ac68346bfa4c5412f9361f78fe6ab9a2c83288d
    Public key (non-compressed):
    04FD769ABA124E2F9D50A7CCB3595C1931280F752EB7D9259F0B6F72FE2D7860E
    20881B635A5F321036E4D9C78825CBA491012C49AA1AC0E06A50ED8AFA82951A7
With these 3 public keys you can make a 2 of 3 multisig address. 1 tool to do this can be found here 
This gives you the **address: 3KAoP9khoS875FRq3taHCsx65L9BH2HfyZ**
Now convert the 3 private keys from hex to wif format.
**Private Key 1 L3245y7HzvYYnyfgUHHZHDs9NvMA1eqe8UAENyeXFXNftuirCCAZ**
**Private Key 2 L2vXdbaUWfyvqbA1U6vqXicv3FUgSCdc6Svsm4ejABWNvetzYrKx**
Private Key 3 5J2Zgu1kcUKK3jkgCSwypNHyTABzc9q3WbZP1huW5wqYCCPkSVa
Then find the **bip38 encrypted private key 3 6PfN3HQnLNQNGeMM8Nm69YLnnfVd1JcSReZd7C3ozZqkuZCBkqvrapSKad**
Password is password (of course).
(I think bitcoinpaperwallet.com must now be forcing compressed keys when bip38 encrypting as both the private key 3 above and it's compressed version, Kx9uH6aKVZZpf5hn1XXfn4yvATZXG9y45dXvA7YjNq3EgJ8JDTiM, now give, 6PRKxfF8otEnh4csvb2DTCqVFqDVtFdUELjw2B6pSuUKa14D9fSghMuNwY).
You can then use a qr code generator and make 2 paper wallets with the address and encrypted key 3 on both, private key 1 on paper wallet 1 and private key 2 on paper wallet 2.
Keep 1 wallet and give another to a next of kin or trusted family member/friend.
Now you should be able to redeem funds with
1. Wallet 1 (key 1 and 3 with password)
2. Wallet 2 (key 2 and 3 with password)
3. Wallet 1 &amp; 2 (keys 1 &amp; 2. No password required).
Although looking at  it looks like you might also need the redemption script for all 3 options above. I might need to look into this.

Have a look here for detailed information on bip 32 wallets. 
There is some code at the end for working with bip 32 wallet keys. 
Basically a private/public key pair are extended with a chain code.  From the private key plus chain code you can generate a new set of private keys and chain codes. From these private keys and chain codes (also known as an extended private keys)  you can generate even more extended private keys. So you have a tree of extended private keys. 
From the private keys you can obviously generate the public keys and addresses. Also from the initial (otherwise known as master)  extended public key you can generate a set of public keys and therefore addresses. These addresses happen to correspond to the same private keys generated from the master extended private key. 
So from a pair of master extended private/public keys you can generate a tree of keys. Bip32 also suggests a standard tree layout. The top level being the master. 2nd level keys are accounts. The 3rd are chains of which 2 are defined. 0 = the external chain and 1 = the internal chain. The external is intended  to produce keys to give to other people and internal are for change addresses. The 4th level is then the keys that are used. 
Don't worry if you don't understand the tree structure. It is just a suggestion and you don't have to stick to it. 
Now you can put the master extended public key on your server. You can assign everyone an individual account. When someone requests an address you can workout an address from the master extended public key, their account, the external chain and the next unused key. The notation used for say accont 6 and the 8th key of the external (0) chain would be M/6/0/8. 
As there are no private keys online, all money is being sent directly to cold storage. All the corresponding private keys can be generated offline. I did post an example of working with the code somewhere. If I can find it I'll repost it here.

I think the question you're asking is: what happens if someone writes a change into the mining software and installs it on 20k machines. 
If you change the block validation rules the rest of the network will ignore your blocks. That is how you get 2 chains that have forked.

There's no good reason to reduce conf times.
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:18:43
Why? At the point of sale (or point of transfer to the card) the bitcoins are converted to fiat. At this point you are in the  traditional banking system. A chargeback could be performed via the traditional banking system and if the card is denominated in bitcoins the fiat converted to bitcoins at the current rate then credited to the card. It does mean the chargeback might not return the same number of bitcoins but this is no different than the current returns policies of bitcoin accepting stores. 
What is it about charge backs that makes you say this is unworkable?

A miner can not promise to not process a double spend. They have now way of knowing which transaction is legit and which is a double spend. Both are valid transactions.

The problem you will have with these payment processors is that (like me) you live in the UK. 
Coinbase will only link to US bank accounts. 
Bitpay will convert bitcoin to GBP at the point of sale and at the end of the day, move the money to your bank account. But you have to have a minimum of £1000.
There are these people who appear to be relatively new. 
I don't really know anything about them though. 
If you would rather collect bitcoins and convert them to GBP at your own leisure you can use android with any bitcoin app (Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach, mycelium, blockchain.info). And on an apple device, I think blockchain.info is still on the app store. If not you might be able to use their web interface. 
To convert your bitcoins to GBP have a look at this UK based exchange. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 07:08:11

@_date: 2014-08-27 12:36:33


Depends. 


Offline addresses. 


1. Unencrypted copy/copies
2. Multiple copies encrypted with different passprases
3. Single copy encrypted with multiple passwords
4. Mulitsig


Some hot some cold (some colder).


1. Hot wallet on a mobile device
2. Paper wallets


1. Online backup
2. Brain wallet (randomly generated) / Paper-brain wallet. 


Start with a bip32 brain wallet. Randomly generated of course (see diceware). Although this does raise other risks. 
1. Moving money without exposing all of it to a compromised computer. 
2. Loss via change address

Do you do the same when you hear millimeter, milligram, millisecond and milliliter?
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:16:02
After thinking about this a bit more I'd go for a 1 of 2 multi sig address(es). You could then have a local wallet that would periodically move money from your main pool of addresses to 1 (or more) of the multi sig addresses. 
I would compare this to a direct debit. With a direct debit you give a payee full access to all the money in your amount and trust them to take the correct amount. 
With the above suggestion you can partition your money and give a payee access to some of it. If the amount is fixed every money then they'll only get access to that amount. If variable you might need to over fund the address each month but it limits the amount they can take and you can take back the difference. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:04:40
So. DVDs are region locked. Payment related != bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:09:03


The worst possible brainwallet. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:40:54
A 1 of 2 multi sig address. You have 1 key and they have the other. They agree to only take x amount every month. They can only take what you put in (doesn't have to be all at once).
Nlocktimed transactions is another option. These can be issued before the payment date but will only be accepted by the network on/after the payment date. But as they refer to specific utxo's (coins) the money has to already be on the sending address. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:56:29
The question you should be asking is
Is 1 bitcoin conf = 1 anycoin conf in terms of security
Or is
1 10minute conf = 10 1minutes confs?
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:15:32
A [Bip32]( encrypted key using EC multiply is another way. 
But I don't think either method actually get op what he wants. 




Neither method is going to help you send bitcoins without creating a new transaction because you are sending to newly created address/key pairs. 
With a stealth address the receivers sends his stealth address. The sender generates a new bitcoin address to which they send bitcoins.
With bip 32 using EC multiply the receiver sends an intermediate code. The sender generates a new encrypted private key, sends it to the receiver and bitcoins to its address. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:51:26
This is a complete guess. There's no evidence of this.

1 satoshi is a non-standard transaction. Most miners will ignore it and not forward it. 0 fee means you might have to wait until its priority is high enough. Priority is based on the age of the input coin(s) and amount. 1 satoshi will probably never be confirmed.

It's the difference between an inflationary currency and a deflationary 1. With a deflationary currency things cost less over time so as a bitcoin becomes too big you'll want to move to m฿ then µ฿. With an inflationary currency things go the other way. Things gradually become more expensive so you're more likely to see things like $100k or $100M.

He has to look for all transactions that contain a public key after the op_return and check if that key multipled by his stealth address produces the address of 1 of the outputs of that transaction.

You don't need 50%. You're not asking for the bitcoin  protocol (which operates in satoshis) to be updated. All you're asking for is to change the way the numbers are displayed. I could write a wallet now that that renames a 100µ฿ to a bit or a bitcoin or whatever.

1 billion people start creating addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second without producing any duplicates.
In order for me to have a 1 in 1 billion chance of randomly creating a collision they would have had to have created 1 billionth of all the address.
There are 2^160 addresses. 1 billionth of this is 2^160 / (10^9 ).
Time to create this 1 billionth of all addresses is 2^160 / (10^9 )/60/60/24/356 = 4.6*1013 years.
So 1 billion people creating addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second will take 46344 billion years before they even have a 1 billion to 1 chance of creating a collision.
Age of the universe is 13.77 billion years

@_date: 2014-03-24 09:32:45
This has been proposed may times before. This is a bad idea because of the confusion it will cause between old bitcoins and new bitcoins both being called a bitcoin. On top of that it doesn't actually solve the problem. It merely postpones it. You end up having to do the same thing sometime down the line when your new bitcoins increase too much in value. 
Why not give your new bitcoins a different name? In fact we already have a system for this. We can call your new bitcoins millibits.

@_date: 2014-06-12 16:08:40


No it's not. The blockchain alone can not prove this. You can only prove that you send bitcoins from an address you own to some address. 
For example if I was a merchant I could just say that isn't my address. You must have just sent the coins to 1 of your other addresses and must be trying to defraud me.

@_date: 2014-10-28 08:19:08
Yes. But that's the risk you take. You're trying to swap your coins for other coins that are not related to the publicly known address that everyone is watching. And so what if some of the coins go missing if you've stolen them in the 1st place.
@_date: 2014-02-03 07:53:49
If you send bitcoins and in return receive money via paypal, you have to really trust the other party. As it is against the paypal TOS to sell cryptocurrencies the other party can complain to paypal, giving any reason they want. As it is against their TOS, paypal will not investigate, they will simply reverse the transaction. The other party then walks away with the bitcoins and the money.

BTC = ฿ = bitcoin
mBTC = m฿ = millibit
uBTC = µ฿ = microbit

1µ฿ = 0.001m฿ = ฿0.000001
Some people are pushing for 1bit = 1µ฿  
A satoshi is currently the smallest unit a bitcoin is divisible to (8 decimal places).
1 satoshi = 0.01µ฿ = 0.00001m฿ = ฿0.00000001

Everything worked exactly as it should. Anyone can make any changes they want and all miners are free to chose if they want to mine using these changes/rules.

Yes... Other than to coinbase, your bank and the authorities. 


They might be able to trace it back to a coinbase hot wallet. If they can they would still have to ask coinbase for a name and they wouldn't be able to tell if the coins had changed hands if they've been moved through more than 1 address after leaving coinbase.

It's technically possible but so is someone randomly generating a private key that someone else is using. Without context both of these statements are meaningless.
Think what it would take. It only takes 1 person to write the software. This will create a hard fork but requires all miners in every country to change to this fork. If not then 2 chains would grow. To use the new fork you need your wallet author to update the app to use the new fork or you'd have to change to a wallet that does support the new fork. 
There would likely be trading between original and new bitcoins. Which coin are people or likely to gravitate to? The 1 that loses value over time or the 1 that holds value?

Lost coins will reduce the supply and should generally cause the price of a bitcoin to increase, reducing the time over which you would want to move to a lower denomination.

Honest generators only build onto a block (by referencing it in blocks they create) if it is the latest block in the longest **valid** chain. "Length" is calculated as total combined difficulty of that chain, not number of blocks, though this distinction is only important in the context of a few potential attacks. **A chain is valid if all of the blocks and transactions within it are valid**, and only if it starts with the genesis block.

@_date: 2014-05-01 19:06:38
That is a fair point. But you don't need to know what it is or how it does what it does. Just what it enables. Which is
1. Given 2 key pairs, if you exchange the public keys you can calculate the same shared secret (a 256 bit number) from either private key and the other pairs public key. 
2. Given a public key and a 256 bit number you can calculate a new public key (and therefore address). Then using the private key corresponding to the initial public key and the same 256 bit number you can (independently) calculate the corresponding private key to the newly generated address.

I assume by cross insure you mean exchange A insures exchange B and exchange B insures exchange A. 
Insurance is a very different business from running an exchange. 
If you were running an exchange would you want to take on the risk involved in insuring another exchange?
And it wouldn't even necessarily solve the problem. Instead of 1 exchange going bankrupt you'll have 2 exchanges going bankrupt, when the 2nd exchange that is insuring the 1st 1 to go bankrupt can't afford to cover all of its liabilities. 
Insurance doesn't mean free money.

This is not a problem for the time traveller if done correctly. In the future when there are computers many more times powerful than the fastest quantum computers the time traveller needs to start his computer working on finding the private keys for those addresses that mined the early blocks and which the private keys have since been lost. 
Even for this powerful computer this will take until the end of time. But for a time traveller this is not a problem. They simply travel to the end of time to pick up their private keys before carrying on with their time travelling.

They check a large number of nodes. Given that most nodes will not accept or forward a double spend (even if it has a higher transaction fee) when a large number of nodes have seen your transaction and you haven't seen any other nodes with a double spent transaction, this gives you confidence that your transaction will be mined.

I've never really looked into how p2pool works. Is it that with a pool the pool operator decides which transactions go into a block and all miners work towards this block but with p2pool each miner builds their own block that then the block reward is shared?
So what's to stop me building a pool and having my pool mine on p2pool? Obviously my pool will have a higher hash rate than you solo miners so my pool will get a bigger share of the block reward.

No shouting just interesting in discussing. The point I'm trying to make is that you are moving onto a solution without actually defining the problem. If you can't measure the amount of decentralisation or know how much decentralisation is required (and why) then you don't even know if you have a problem in the 1st place.
@_date: 2014-01-22 08:54:50
No. The blockchain is decentralized. No one can modify it independently from everyone else. Double spends are a problem for unconfirmed transaction. Ie, those not yet in the blockchain. 
Imagine you and I were keeping ledgers (ie, we're miners). Bob tells you he's given ฿1 to Alice, but here also tells me he's given this same bitcoin to chloe. 
When I next see you I say, Bob has given his ฿1 to chloe. You say, no, he can't have. He gave that ฿1 to Alice. How do we now decide which is the valid transaction? What about a 3rd miner? Does he know about both transactions? Which 1 is he trying to add to the blockchain? And to further complicate things, imagine that any time stamp on a transaction can be forged. 
How do we make sure that everyone knows about these 2 conflicting transactions and how do we decide which to add to the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:34:32
I'm always irritated by my balance showing in big and bold when I open my wallet. If bitcoin becomes used in face to face transactions then maybe I don't want everyone seeing how much I have in my pocket. 
I'd like an interface where you can pull down from the top of the screen which would pull down the current window to reveal another window beneath it showing your balance and when you let go it snaps back up.

If it's not on the blockchain it didn't happen.

1) The txin's owned by the payor are not revealed to the payee. In fact,
   they could be held by a third-party who simply makes a transaction
   with the appropriate txouts on behalf of the payee.
2) Less information about the txouts is leaked. The statistical
   distribution of txouts remains unchanged - not possible in re-use
   schemes because they need to grind the payee scriptPubKey's for the
   sake of the prefix filters.
3) If required the nonce secret can be revealed to prove that a payment
   was made to a third-party, e.g. for dispute resolution.

No. It's a different public key. The way stealth transactions work is like this. 
Bob creates a private/public key pair (b, B). The public key (B) becomes his stealth address. 
Alice wants to pay Bob so he sends her his stealth address. 
Alice creates a new private/public key pair (a, A). This public key is the nonce. 
Using their own private key and the other person's public key, Alice and Bob now have a shared secret, Ab = Ba = S. 
Alice now takes Bob's public key (his stealth address) and multiplies it by the secret to find a new public key and it's address. By the magic of ECC the private key needed to spend from this address happens to be Bob's private key multiplied by the secret. Alice sends money to this address. 
The only point not addressed so far is how Bob receives Alice's public key that she used as a nonce. This is included in the transaction using the OP_RETURN.

You're confusing transactions and confirmations. A transaction will propagate to most of the network almost instantly.

You could create a transaction that cannot be mined into a block until some future date and can be changed before that date, but I am not aware of anyway to prevent coins moving. If you have a private key you can always create a normal transaction and move coins immediately.

Really? Is this a true fact or a fun fact? I've never heard of people getting "hung up" because bitcoin is not legal tender.
In the UK, leagal tender is only meaningful in a court of law and for tax purposes.
Here is what the royal mint has to say about legal tender.


And for tax purposes HMRC says this about bitcoin.
1. Income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received.
2. Income received by miners for other activities, such as for the provision of services in connection with the verification of specific transactions for which specific charges are made, will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) of the EU VAT Directive as falling within the definition of 'transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments.'
3. When Bitcoin is exchanged for Sterling or for foreign currencies, such as Euros or Dollars, no VAT will be due on the value of the Bitcoins themselves.
4. Charges (in whatever form) made over and above the value of the Bitcoin for arranging or carrying out any transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) as outlined at 2 above.
I really can't see any point in defining a term "common tender". It's just meaningless words.

If only 1 miner updates to a 20mb block, when that miner mines a block that is &gt;1mb, all other miners will reject this block as invalid. The &lt;1mb chain will grow faster and the 20mb miner will select this as the longest valid chain.
To be on the 20mb block chain you need to update your miner - which is basically the definition of a hard fork. This fork also needs more mining power than the old (unless you make the old style blocks invalid in the new fork).

@_date: 2014-02-17 09:55:07
This could push the exchange rate higher. If a lot of miners drop out the block confirmation time would be longer. During this time there would be less bitcoins being produced and therefore less supply. If the demand stays constant it will push the price higher.

Bitcoin doesn't have to be that. When people say the average person can't use bitcoin I'm thinking of sending/receiving day to day transactions of the kind of values that you'd keep in your wallet. For anything more we're already seeing bitcoin banks appear. 
I'm not saying the average person is or isn't capable of these things. All I'm saying is think objectively. Before assuming the average person is someone less capable than you and will never get it, find out what the average person is capable of.

Increasing the max block size will not make blocks larger. Only increased adoption will cause more transactions and therefore bigger blocks. If you can't slow down user adoption you can't stop the number of transactions growing. It would be far worse if mempools start dropping transactions.

This is not sneaking with regards to the few gentoo devs that you might have discussed this with but to tell the community you made a mistake, will fix it and then repeat your actions at a later time is most certainly sneaky behavior.
I gave my brother a small amount as his 1st bitcoins. He put them on an exchange to see if he could make more. What of someone takes their tip and decides to bet it on satoshi dice? Their 1st introduction to bitcoin will be 1 of a transaction that takes forever to confirm and could drive that person away from bitcoin.
Imagine a world where everyone used your spam filter and reconsider the above scenario. Now that persons 1st experience of bitcoin will be 1 where bitcoin simply doesn't work. Or they might find out that satoshi dice has been blacklisted and ask what happens if someone wants to blacklist me? This is completely against what bitcoin is and devalues the network.

Yes. A bip32 wallet takes a random seed and from this calculates a master key pair. This (or the seed) would be more correctly called your wallet. It looks like mycelium will show you your seed but not your master keys. 
From the master key pair is calculated the accounts. From the accounts is calculated 2 chains. These are used internally and your wallet doesn't provide information on them. The private/public keys (and addresses) that you use are calculated form the chains. 
This diagram from bip32 probably explains it better 
(Although I have just noticed that this diagram labels the depth 1 nodes as wallets/accounts).
Mycelium uses a slightly different structure described by bip43 and bip44 but the idea is the same. The account is not the top level. Mycelium also attempts to provide you with only the information they think you will need in day to day usage and hide the rest.

@_date: 2014-10-13 09:43:19
I'm not aware of any software that will make this simple but it is certainly possible.
1st it is useful to understand contracts. Have a read of example 1 here.
But I don't think this is complete for what you want.
1st a transaction (T1) is created that sends 10 months rent to a 2-of-2 multisig address. You have 1 private key and I have the other. This transaction is not broadcast yet.
A 2nd transaction is created (T2) that uses nLockTime set to say 12 months and will send the bitcoins from the multisig address back to me. This needs both of us to sign it, so I send the transaction to you, you sign it and send it back to me.
I then broadcast T1. We now have 10 months rent locked in an address that needs a signature from both you and me to move. If in 12 months the money is still there I get it back - just in case you turf me out.
When rent is due.
I create a transaction (T3) that spends 1 month rent to you and the rest back to the multisig address. Now this transaction will make T2 invalid so before I send T3 to you (for a signature) I create a new transaction (T4). T4 will replace T2 and is a nLockTime transaction (lets say for 11 months now) that sends the remaining coins back to me. When you have signed this transaction and sent it back to me I send you T3 which you sign and broadcast.
We are now in a similar position to the one we were previously. You have collected 1 months rent and we have a multisig address that holds 9 months rent and requires both you and me to move any coins or after 11 months if no money has moved I get it back.
You could also potentially modify this to maintain a rolling 10 months deposit.
These sites might help.
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:58:17
The very next block was only 383 KB. If the block had been too big, any remaining transactions would have made it into the very next block. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:54:44
OK, but what is the other possibility. We keep 1mb blocks but they grow to capacity. If there's no way of increasing the transaction throughput the mempool will grow beyond its capacity and nodes will start dropping transactions and therefore increasing the possibility of a double spend. You would need to find a method of increasing transactions volume without increasing the blockchain size.

* bsm117532: Are you arguing “fee pressure is good” and therefore small blocks and zero growth are desirable?
 Greg: fee pressure is an intentional part of the system design and to the best of the current understanding essential for the system’s long term survival. So, uh, yes. It’s good.
* Wladimir van der Laan on the dev mailing list, May 2015:
 A mounting fee pressure, resulting in a true fee market where transactions compete to get into blocks, results in urgency to develop decentralized off-chain solutions.
* Greg Maxwell on bitcointalk, way back in January 2013:
 But before I think we can even have a discussion about increasing [the block size limit] I think there must be evidence that the transaction load has gone over the optimum level for creating a market for fees (e.g. we should already be at some multiple of saturation and still see difficulty increasing or at least holding steady). This would also have the benefit of further incentivizing external fast payment networks, which I think must exist before any blockchain increase

Why? Anyone can write mining software. I can do it now if I want. The challenge is convincing everyone why it's a good idea to run code implementing your changes. Is SPV mining a security risk as you've suggested? Maybe you should put your security concerns to Gavin then he  could address them. 


What does quid quo pro mean?


Any mining software can introduce SPV mining. Gavin's point is that miners are already doing it but doing a crap job of it and if you're going to do it then this is a better way. 


SPV mining is only a problem while the block reward is so high. Think about it. If you were a miner you'd do it as well. All this code is open source. Any mining software can implement it. If this is what the miners want why don't block stream/core also implement it?

The current reference mining software will not forward a double spending transaction. Miners can only mine transactions they know about. AFAIK mycelium is connecting to a large number of nodes and checking to see what transactions those nodes will forward. This allows them to measure how far a transaction has propagated as well as checking for conflicting (Ie, double spending) transactions. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 09:22:11
It's not about how long it takes to get mined though. It's about how long it takes the transaction to propagate. Miners will not forward a transaction if it double spends (this includes double spending coins in an unconfirmed transaction).  A zero fee transaction does take longer to propagate though.

The key to this is understanding how the bitcoin network works. Bitcoin does not keep track of balances on accounts that you can spend arbitrary amounts from. 
Bitcoin keeps track of transactions. Transactions have inputs and outputs. An output is how bitcoins are assigned to new addresses, it is an address and amount of bitcoins. Inputs are outputs from a previous transaction that have not yet been spent and signed by the private key of the address that owns it. 
Therefore unspent transaction outputs can be considered as "coins". You can not spend part of a coin. So, just like with physical money, if you don't have exact change you hand over more than you need to and expect to receive change. 
When you import a private key (regardless of source) you give the wallet access to spend the coins on that address. If in a transaction the total value of your coins is greater than the amount you want to send the rest will be sent to a change address. It is up to the wallet app how it decides to select the change address. It may do it deterministicly or it could do it at random. 
If you are unsure where your money went you can check the transaction on blockchain.info.

Aw come on u/petertodd you need the private key to steel any coins. Ah, but they're not checking the signature so you can put anything you want there and it'll just be ignored and verified. Then you just need to catch up the last 24hr of work. Aw come on u/petertodd. It even says in the white paper that bitcoin only works if the majority of miners are honest. I.e. you cannot catch up from 24hr behind.

No. HMRC changed their mind on that. 
For VAT purposes Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies will be treated as follows below, this in no way reflects on how they are treated for regulatory or other purposes:
1. Income received from Bitcoin mining activities will generally be outside the scope of VAT on the basis that the activity does not constitute an economic activity for VAT purposes because there is an insufficient link between any services provided and any consideration received.
2. Income received by miners for other activities, such as for the provision of services in connection with the verification of specific transactions for which specific charges are made, will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) of the EU VAT Directive as falling within the definition of 'transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments.'
3. When Bitcoin is exchanged for Sterling or for foreign currencies, such as Euros or Dollars, no VAT will be due on the value of the Bitcoins themselves.
4. Charges (in whatever form) made over and above the value of the Bitcoin for arranging or carrying out any transactions in Bitcoin will be exempt from VAT under Article 135(1)(d) as outlined at 2 above.

This is not true. Under a traditional soft fork old miners (while being forced into spv mining) could still valid *most* transaction/block rules. You are correct when you say they could mine an invalid bock.

The max bock size soft fork proposal is to only mine empty blocks with the transaction merkle root encoded in the coinbase transaction. Therefore if you don't update you can't mine because you're probably trying to include transactions in your block. You also can't see incoming transactions because you don't know where to look for them. 
So you have to update.
The segwit soft fork will turn old mining software into spv miners.

See, there's the problem. What we can and can't talk about in the comments. By all means delete new submissions/posts that are off topic, but comments are off limits. You do not delete.
I disagree with most of what you said. 


There's no such thing as an alt-client. They're all bitcoin mining software.
Who decides what is an un-necessary fork?
I say a block size hard fork is necessary, so now I can talk about Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, BitPay's core?


No such thing. 


Wrong. Your risk aversion to hard forks is harmful. The generalised soft hard firm fork is harmful.


Why can we only talk about core? If other clients are off limits then so should core be.


Who decides when we can talk about these things?

Yes it is. Bitcoin-core does not define the bitcoin protocol any more than internet explorer defines http. Anyone can write bitcoin mining software. If another client gains a majority, it would define the valid consensus rules that the majority follow. 
You can not stop people writing mining software so why are you trying so hard to do just that?

Why only the core dev team? There are multiple bitcoin mining clients with their own dev teams.


No it doesn't. You can still keep the spam and scams out. 


They are following the same blockchain and have the same utxo set.


Yea they do. They are validating the same blocks and have the same utxo set.


I did no such thing. I asked why you are setting a rule that we can only talk about the bitcoin mining software named bitcoin-core?


But only the parts of bitcoin you want to talk about. 


I question your decision to allow taking about only some parts of bitcoin.

You're thinking like a software engineer. 
The payment method used is irrelevant. What is important is Todd's actions and intentions. The courts will ask, did he intent to defraud coinbase/reddit.
Todd went onto reddit to purchase reddit gold and sent payment (in bitcoin). He entered into an agreement to pay money for a product. When the product was delivered he double spent the transaction then bragged about it on the internet.

You're going to have to explain your logic better than simply saying you're wrong. The quotes show that the bitcoin-core devs are trying to increase the fees (they're doing this by limiting the block size). They want to do it to drive people away from bitcoin and onto something like lightning. Have another look at the quotes in the link.

We're not going to fill every 8Mb block tomorrow but even if we did.
8Mb * 144blocks/day * 30days / 1024 = 33.75Gb/month.

It's not random and it's low entropy.
Why not just take at **random** 12 word [bip39]( encoded phrase.
Which will create a [bip44]( wallet.
Which can store any coin 
Import the "account" level extended **public** key(s) into [sentinel]( and it'll generate the addresses for you without your private key, which you can keep cold.
Memorise your **random** phrase and you always have access to your cold stored coins. And/or print to store in your deposit box.
The problem with brain wallets is that people don't use **random** data. Never use something from a book, film, song... anything written down or guessable - it must be **random**.
And don't roll your own.

Call it what it is - a fork. Core would also be a fork in this situation.
@_date: 2015-08-08 20:59:38
Exactly. Everyone's RNG is broken. For example ask a lot of people to chose a number between 1 and 10. Instead of an even distribution you get more than expected choosing 7, 3 and 9. People think more alike than you think.


It actually depends on how many words you're selecting from. Google diceware for a good explanation. It's really not hard to remember a truly randomrandom high entropy passphrase using diceware for example.

I think you might have been down voted because it's impossible to backdoor the bitcoin protocol. And even on compromised devices it's still possible to use bitcoin securely. But people have no imagination. Couldn't a backdoored device report all your bitcoin transactions? That doesn't seem so far fetched to me.

I don't think people like their spending power varying wildly on a daily basis.
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:40:42
Exactly. The difference could be negligible. Also my understanding of headers first is that only the header needs to be transmitted when a block is found and as most nodes will have already seen most transactions you only need to request the transactions you've missed. Therefore propagation time will not be a function of block size. That just leaves the time required to validate the block which is calculating a lot of double sha256 hashes. And as the miners are specially geared up to do just this it if far from clear to me if larger blocks will add any significant delay.
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:26:24
The maths doesn't checkout (or have I missed something). 


How is this determined?
There will likely be people voting for both an increase and decrease. Therefore in the middle 60%
"the bottom most vote of the middle 60%" is likely to be below the current limit.
"the upper most vote of the middle 60%" is likely to be above the current limit.
So how does this work?


Edit: Or do you mean that all 60% have to be either above or below the current limit otherwise there is no change?


@_date: 2015-08-12 06:27:02
This is not news. Let me know when we have 44% of headers set to a version number of 0x20000007.

But the exchange rate of bitcoin changes so you'd have to print 1m฿, 5m฿ &amp; 50m฿ notes. Then before handing over any notes you'd get your phone out to check the exchange rate. But if you've got your phone out anyways, why not just make a normal bitcoin transaction?

All we need is a limit that doesn't prevent transactions during normal usage but does prevent someone ddosing the network by sending many transactions. There's no need to try and make the limits as accurate as these variable maximum sizes are trying to do.

That may be true. But the world is going cashless. Bitcoin is a digital system that simulates cash. There's good reason to have money on your person instead of relying on a bank to transfer money at your request. For example I'm from the UK and worked in Germany for a while. My bank's fraud department blocked my bank card because it had been used in Germany.


I bought some products from wholly hemp. It was the slickest checkout I've ever used. On my laptop I went to checkout. It requested delivery details and presented a qr code. I entered the delivery address took out my mobile and paid. The website immediately changed to a "payment received" page. I've bought via bitpay as well and had a similar experience.
IRL the biggest problem is that staff are unfamiliar with it. I've sold for bitcoins at cex and had a pub meal and couple of pints then paid with bitcoin. On both occasions I was their 1st bitcoin customer. The staff were not really interested in bitcoin and didn't really know what they were doing but did manage to work it out. 
In addition bip70 promises to make address exchange between devices even easier. You wouldn't see an address just an id and notification that their SSL cert is valid. 1 interesting thing this opens up is digitally signed receipts.
Using bitcoin is not difficult to use. Securing however I agree is not for everyone. Bitcoin banks are still possible and I wouldn't mind living in a world were we have bitcoin and bitcoin banks.
Remember though that there is a lot of publishing bias when you read stories of lost/stolen bitcoins.


Agreed. But you can build reversible systems on top of a non-reversible one. You can not build a non-reversible system on top of a reversible one.

I am not an economist but I've read there are economists that argue that a small account of deflation is not necessarily a bad thing. And I've never heard anyone giving deflation as a reason for not buying gold.

If you have bitcoin in a local wallet it's like having cash in your pocket.

The majority of transactions would not happen on the bitcoin blockchain. They would use something like the lightning network (not yet deployed). For this particular example the lightning network does actually use valid bitcoin transactions, but they are not immediately broadcast to the bitcoin network. Without getting into to much detail it means that transactions can be updated/replaced but at some point a final transaction has to be broadcast on the bitcoin blockchain, ie, settled. The bitcoin-core team appear to be trying to drive this by making the miners fees too expensive for most transactions.

You don't want to remove the high entry barrier to mining. This would make it easier for someone to attack the network. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 08:09:53


I know what the utxo set is but it's not usually called the utxo mempool. The utxo set and mempool are 2 different things. So again, what did you mean when you said






Exactly my point. This is why "Limiting block size does not necessarily limit the size of the utxo set."
Therefore of the attack you are referring to is to increase the size of the utxo set then small blocks will not protect you from this. It is inevitable that small miners will get dropped from the network. 


I have no loyalty.

You don't have to. It only needs to be good enough. 
Imagine there were 100 different mining apps. 1 has a fault and forks. This will not cause the rest of the network any problems. The devs of the faulty implementation can go away, fix it then come back.

With a double spend most nodes will not forward the double spend so you can have some confidence the transaction will confirm. For low value transactions the risk is negligible. With always full blocks a transaction could be ignored until is eventually dropped from all mempools and therefore never confirm.
@_date: 2015-09-19 07:04:34
Limiting block size does not necessarily limit the size of the utxo set.  All nodes will drop transactions (including core)  if there is constantly more than will fit in the blockchain. Bitcoinxt drops transactions in such a way that the network as a whole will retain more transactions than bitcoin-core will.

No. It's just a way of deriving private/public keys from 1 master key so you only have to back up 1 key. The blockchain has no concept of HD keys. Although there's no reason a wallet couldn't be written to act as you describe.

What about it? Limiting block size can only cause the mempool size to increase.


We can't protect all miners forever who refuse to upgrade their infrastructure.


Limiting block size is not the correct solution. If the rate of transactions is constantly higher than the rate that transactions can be put into blocks the network will start forgetting transactions. This is unacceptable.

@_date: 2015-04-04 00:37:43
Bitcoins can only be moved if you have the private key to the address they belong to. If you import a private key into a wallet you give that wallet the ability to move those coins. But anyone else that also had that private key and also still move those coins. If you sweep a private key the wallet creates a new transaction moving the coins to a new address in that wallet. Therefore only that wallet will have the private key to these coins.

A transaction contains a version number (which I think is included in the transaction's signatures) but a hard fork doesn't have to force this to increase. If the fork doesn't require this to be updated then the transaction is valid on both forks. But someone could double spend, ie send coins to 1 address on 1 fork and the same coins to another address on the other fork. The 2 chains will also diverge naturally as they will have different mined coins. As these mined coins mix with all the other coins more transactions will be valid on only 1 fork.

How do you know address 1 and address 4 are exchanges? All you can actually see is
Address 1 -&gt; address 2 -&gt; address 3 (stealth transaction) -&gt; address 4.
Stealth addresses work like this. I put in a public place, this is my stealth address (address s).
Someone takes this address and calculates a new address using my address s and their own key pair. This creates a new shared secret address (address ss). They send money to address ss and put some stealth address data in the transaction so that I (and only I) can find it.
Now everyone knows address s is mine because I put it in a public place. But no one knows address ss is mine.

1. Someone writes the code to increase divisibility. 
Because this will cause a hard fork next steps are:
2. Convince miners to mine with the new software which will create a new fork.
3. Convince everyone else that the new fork is the correct 1 and anyone using the old software/rules should update so they are on the correct fork.
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:54:43
But how do you decide which?

@_date: 2015-09-11 16:35:34
Ok, I think that what you're getting at is that even if 75% of the miners, mine the XT fork the exchanges could still say they are running core and therefore you can't sell xt forked coins here which will make them worthless (or vice versa).

Well had just pointed out to me that you can still use ripple the way you used to be able to but you have to use their api.
But there appear to be trying to make access to ripple via gateways only. Which make the whole system like a network of banks and just a more convenient and faster method of transferring between accounts.
With stellar the gateways only role is to move currency on and off the network. And you're not just limited to trusting gateways. 
You could use stellar as a distributed exchange (of the volume is there).
Say your friends/family like the idea of bitcoin but are uncomfortable with sending a bank transfer to some exchange. You could act as a stellar gateway for them. This would allow them to give you cash and they can buy bitcoin.
Stellar also claim the ripple consensus is flawed and they are working to fix it.

So what you're saying is that no one can quantify the amount of decentralisation required?
@_date: 2015-11-04 09:10:57


This is true but it depends on the problem that you are considering as to which number is more relevant.
If you are considering accidental collisions then 2^160 is more relevant.
However if you are considering brute forcing keys you have to consider all 2^256 , because unless you know which private keys map to the same addresses without working it out, you still have to try every key.

I think xapo can do this. I haven't take too much interest in it as I haven't needed to use it. It think the idea is that you can set up multiple wallets with n of m spending (although it's a hosted solution so not a blockchain n of m transaction) and spending limits.

Agreed. I argued this point with someone recently. I can't understand why people give so much priority to bitcoin-core. The only thing that matters is the consensus rules, not which software they're implemented in.
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:05:07
Irreconcilable forks have got nothing to do with the hash rate on either side of the fork. The only time forks become irreconcilable is when they have different consensus rules and the fork can happen at almost any split of hash rate.

I'm sceptical about side chains. I can't see a use case for them (but that's not to say there isn't 1). I think micro payment channels are a good idea and lightning is in theory an extension of that but it's yet to be seen how it'll be implemented (ripple was a good idea but completely mismanaged).
What is the question? If a fee market stunts the growth of bitcoin will SC or LN solve that?

The idea behind ripple is sound but I don't like the direction it is now going in. Stellar is what ripple should have been.


I didn't know this. I haven't read the whole wiki but I don't understand why this is needed. My first impression is that this breaks ripple.


This is why xrp will never be worth very much. But ripple is not xrp.

No. Never use any sentence that is public knowledge. 
1. You will not chose the sentence at random. You will chose 1 that has meaning to you.
2. There are not enough sentences (low entropy) that are known and have meaning to people.
3. Taking the 1st letter of each word only adds 1bit of entropy.


There is no such tool because calculating entropy requires knowing the method used.
Entropy is the measure of possible outcomes (passphrases) your method can produce.
lf I roll a dice I will get a random number from 1 to 6 but it's entropy is low. If I were to pick a playing card there are 52 possible results and therefore higher entropy.

My understanding of sidechains is that bitcoin would have to become an spv client of the sidechain (of every sidechain?) So what happens if everyone stops mining a sidechain. If the sidechain isn't available does that stop all new miners from syncing?
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:07:16


Do you need to? Let's say for example there were 100 different mining software. If 1 of them experiences a problem that means they can't verify a block it would attempt to mine a fork. Assuming even mining power distribution across mining implementations the faulty 1 would not be able to cause any damage. The dev team for that software would go away to fix it then come back and play again.

Agreed, but I'm arguing against the point that you can't have more than 1 implementation because it's extremely difficult to ensure the 2 are 100% the same.
Imagine there were 100 mining implementations with an even distribution of miners using them and that they all agree on 99% of the consensus rules (which 99% differs between implementations). The network plods along without hitting any of these edge cases.
Then 1 implementation invalidates a valid block. This doesn't cause a problem for the network. There'll just be a temporary drop in hash rate. Miners using this implementation will be forked off the network. They will have to wait for an update and/or use a different implementation. A short lived fork is not a problem for wallets using the wrong fork (unless there is a targeted attack) as the 2 forks are initially the same and slowly start to diverge.
Therefore a less than 100% agreement on the consensus rules is not the problem it is being made out to be as long as there are many implementations so that any fork does not split the mining power down the middle.

A pyramid scheme is an unsustainable business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public.[1][2]
Various forms of pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries including Albania, Australia,[3][4] Austria,[5] Belgium,[6] Brazil, Canada, China,[7] Colombia,[8] Denmark, the Dominican Republic,[9] Estonia,[10] France, Germany, Hong Kong,[11] Hungary, Iceland, Iran,[12] Italy,[13] Japan,[14] Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, the Netherlands,[15] New Zealand,[16] Norway,[17] the Philippines,[18] Poland, Portugal, Romania,[19] Russian Federation, South Africa,[20] Spain, Sri Lanka,[21] Sweden,[22] Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand,[23] Turkey,[24] Ukraine,[25] the United Kingdom, and the United States.[26]
These types of schemes have existed for at least a century, some with variations to hide their true nature. Multilevel marketing plans have also been classified as pyramid schemes.[27][28][29][30]

OK, I understand what you're saying but this is just another step in the direction I don't like.
They appear be making gateways into banks and ripple is just a better method of moving money between these gateway/bank accounts.
Their interface is now geared towards only trusting gateways instead of being able to trust any address. You also have to trust the gateway completely instead of limiting that trust by only trusting then upto say £100.
I liked the idea that the gateway's only job was to allow you to move money onto and off the network. Once your fiat was on there it was as free to move as bitcoin.
And it's not like gateways didn't have any other options. They could bounce your bank transfer back to you or not send you money when cashing out. And obviously you could avoid any gateways that started any of this behavior.

Then they would know the signature was fake. You need to read up on public key cryptography.
If something is encrypted by the public key only the private key can unencrypt it.
And if something is encrypted by the private key only the public key can unencrypt it. 
So if you take a transaction, hash it and encrypt that hash with the private key, this is basically a signature. 
When someone wants to check your signature they unencrypt your signature with the public key and compare it with the hash of the transaction.

This isn't enough. You'd need to spend your coins to different addresses on the 2 networks before using them. Otherwise your transaction will be valid on both networks.

I was going to ask this question.
If they generate a 2 of 2 address and send you the nlocktime transaction they cannot prevent you from moving those coins.
They could, not send you the nlocktime transaction but what's the point? They couldn't move those coins either.
They could make their app generate an address for which they hold all the keys (but that's true of every wallet).
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:03:16

I do not know what BitChain.org is but are you asking how you can use changetip with mycelium (you can't) or are you asking how you move your wallet from BitChain.org to mycelium? You simply create a transaction to move all the coins from 1 wallet to the other.

That's not exactly how bitcoin works. It doesn't track the movement of satoshis. It only records transactions. It's more like gold coins and for each transaction some coins are melted down and new ones of a different value are minted.

4. Import into my wallet
5. Repeat 2-4 for all my wallets
Then all my wallets are backed up with a single HD wallet extended private key.

This is correct and is because bitcoin core has a concept of valid and standard transactions. Bitcoin core will check that the transactions in a block are valid (but not necessarily standard). It also will not mine or relay transactions that are not valid and standard.
A transaction with an output of less than about 55μ฿ is valid and non-standard.
What a miner accepts as standard is up to the individual miners so there are nodes that will accept these non-standard transactions but they usually have to be sent directly to those miners as most of the network will not relay them.

I agree with using a new address for each transaction, but I don't think that encouraging/enforcing it in the protocol solves anything. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:16:37
A bitcoin transaction is made up of inputs and outputs. 
An output is basically an address and an amount to send to that address. 
An input is a previous transactions output. 
Obviously total outputs can not exceed total inputs. 
But if the inputs exceed the outputs the difference is the miners fee. 
A transaction does not explicitly assign a miners fee as an output. The only way to pay a miners fee is by including more inputs than outputs.

Unlike bitcoin you only ever need to buy a small amount of XRP then you never need to buy anymore. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:16:15
Sort of. The bitcoin network doesn't maintain balances. It maintains transactions. A transaction is basically a list of inputs and outputs. An output is an address plus the amount to send to that address. An input is a previous transaction's output. An unspent output is 1 that hasn't been used as an input. There aren't really any coins in the bitcoin network but you can consider an unspent output as a coin. 
Now you can think of addresses as having coins signed to them. Just like physical money, if you don't have exact change you need to use coins that are greater than the amount to be transferred and receive change. 
In bitcoin you collect input "coins" together in a transaction. You can think of these coins as now existing only in the transaction and no longer in the address they came from. The fully value of these coins need to go somewhere, and the outputs assign them to new addresses. If the outputs are less than the inputs the difference is collected as a fee by the miner that mines a block with your transaction in it. This is the reason for needing a change address.

HMAC-SHA512 iterates over sha512. The output hash is fed back in as the input for the next iteration. For 1 iteration you would just sha512(private key). The 2nd sha512(sha512(private key)). There's a little bit more to HMAC-SHA512 than that, but that is the basic idea. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:24:13
The problem here is that 1 private key can have 2 addresses. From a private key you can work out an uncompressed address and a compressed address.
But from an uncompressed address you can not work out a compressed address and from a compressed address you can not work out an uncompressed addresses. Therefore the 2 addresses have to be treated individually in the blockchain.

I'm fine with no chargeback or escrow when a transaction is done in person. But when the transaction is done online I'd prefer escrow. Why is escrow preferred over chargebacks though. Isn't it the same result if a disrupt is started?
I understand the point made above by that you can not build a non-refundable system on top of a refundable one, but you can build a refundable system on top of a non-refundable one. 
I just find it odd that these types of videos push no chargebacks as a positive without explaining why and I'm left thinking that if there is a problem with an online purchase I'd like some kind of come back. 
I also feel like if you are trying to sell the idea of bitcoins to some and say there are no chargebacks and leave it at that, they could very easily see that add a negative.

More managers than workers on the shop floor (for want of a better expresion). And for the service industry I get the impression you Americans get better service because four paying for it more directly. (But I still learn towards needing at least a basic level of NHS - it helps the whole community to keep people in good health).

    # inputs
    p1 = getpass('Passphrase1: ')
    p2 = getpass('Passphrase2: ')
    pi = int(getpass('Pin: '))+10000
    
    # generate the seed values
    index_enum = ('key', 'chain')
    master_seed_hex = {}
    for n in range(2):
        pi = pi + n
        secret_exponent = pbkdf2_hex(p1, p2, pi, 32)
        master_seed_base58 = secret_exponent_to_wif(int(secret_exponent, 16), False)
        master_seed_hex[index_enum[n]] = binary_to_hex(
                                         a2b_hashed_base58(master_seed_base58))[2:]
    
    # build master extended private key
        # Version(0x0488ADE4) + depth (0x00) + parent fingerprint (0x00000000) 
        # + child num (0x00000000) + chain + 0x00 (for private) + key
    master_key_hex = ('0488ADE4' + '00' + '00000000' + '00000000'
                     + master_seed_hex['chain'] + '00' + master_seed_hex['key'])
    master_key_base58 = b2a_hashed_base58(hex_to_binary(master_key_hex))
    
    # import master extended private key into a wallet
    wm = Wallet.from_wallet_key(master_key_base58)
    
    # find the master wallets account 0
    a0 = wm.subkey_for_path(r'0')
    a0_prv_key = a0.wallet_key(True)
    
    # promote account 0 (a0) up a level to make it into a wallet
    a0_hex = binary_to_hex(a2b_hashed_base58(a0_prv_key))
    w0_hex = ('0488ADE4' + '00' + '00000000' + '00000000' 
              + a0_hex[13*2:(13+32)*2] + '00' + a0_hex[(13+32+1)*2:(13+32+1+32)*2])
              # *2 because 1 byte = 2 characters
    w0_base58 = b2a_hashed_base58(hex_to_binary(w0_hex))
    print(w0_base58)
    
    # create wallet 0
    w = Wallet.from_wallet_key(w0_base58)
It will create a bip32 wallet (in python) from 2 passphrases and a pin (using the key derivation function pbkdf2).
It does this by finding a private key and chain code using:
    private_key = pbkdf2(hmac-sha1, passphrase1, passphrase2, pin+1000)
    chain_cade = pbkdf2(hmac-sha1, passphrase1, passphrase2, pin+1001)
Then creating a master wallet private extended key. It then take the account 0 and promotes it up a level to become a wallet (accounts have a depth of 1 and wallets have a depth of 0).
It then prints the extended private key of this new wallet and makes a wallet object called "w" from which you can find any of its child private keys or addresses.

I have to pay council tax because I own a house. I pay road tax because I have a car. If I don't pay road tax I lose my driving license. This is a fair trade because my road tax goes to funding the maintenance of the roads. My council tax pays for the police, the fire service, bin collections, road sweep, NHS. That is a fair deal.

This is not true. Even with 51% hash power, notes still have to play by the rules or the blocks will be rejected by all other nodes. Bitcoins can still only be moved if you know the private key, even in a 51% attack. The only thing you can do with 51% is prevent transactions entering the blockchain and remove transactions already in the blockchain (as long as they are not before the last check point).

The problem is that there isn't really such a thing as a coin in the bitcoin network. There are only transactions. The nearest thing to a coin is an unspent transaction output. 
When you create a transaction you might need more than 1 input (coins) and you create new outputs. 
An analogy would be using gold coins. For each transaction you would take some amount of coins and melt them down together and make 2 new coins. 1 of the amount you want to transact and another which is your left over gold, ie your change. And of course don't forget a small gold flake for the gold smith (bitcoin miner). 
The taint analysis is trying to display what percentage of a coin came from what address.

The problem is really how wallet apps interact with paper wallets. When you import a paper wallet private key into a wallet it is then usually treated just the same as any other private key the app uses. It's also recommended that a wallet returns change to a different address (although the android apps are not doing this and instead return change to 1 of the sending addresses). 
Now what someone attempting to spend from a paper wallet might do is:
1. Open up there wallet that is empty. 
2. Import (or sweep) the paper wallet private key. 
3. Spend *some* of the money on the paper wallet. 
4. Delete the wallet app assuming the rest of the money is still on the paper wallet. 
Number 4 is the problem because the users assumption is wrong. In step 4 any change will have been returned to a new address and when the app is deleted so is the address containing the money. 
It's also worth knowing that importing and sweeping are not the same thing. 
Have a look at this site 
Using that site you could feed it a paper wallet private key and build your own transaction. Ie, select the inputs and outputs. You need to be very careful doing this though. It has been known for people to forget the return address and therefore pay some very expensive miners fees. If you build your transaction this way you can chose the change address. It could go to your wallet app, a new paper wallet or returned to your existing paper wallet for example.

Then you will get an invalid address because there is a checksum in the address than any wallet software can check. This also goes for if you enter some characters incorrectly.

The technical details of bitcoin are sound - only 1 address can own a "coin" at a time, it prevents double spends of the same coin and is done in a distributed/decentralised way. 
Unfortunately your teachers concerns may also be true. People say satoshi owns a large number of coins which have never moved from their original address (I've yet to find what this address is). If this is true he could dump a lot of coins on the market in 1 go which would cause the price to crash. People would start to panic sell then satoshi would be able to buy back at a lower price. 
But why would he do this? If he's been mining since the beginning of bitcoin he probably has so many coins that he didn't need any more.

@_date: 2013-12-31 10:32:50


Yes 


Only if you know what you're doing. You still have to get the private key into a format that you can import into a wallet and so that the wallet recognizes which public key (uncompressed or compressed) that it should be used with.

I don't know much about the internal working of NFC. Tell me about the capabilities of this ring. I assume you program the nfc tag then when scanned it spits out the exact same data you programmed into it. How much data can it store/send? 
A ring that accepts payments would be possible. It would just transmit an address (or a bip32 extended public key). 
As for a ring that sends payments, this is more difficult. Assuming my above assumption is correct :-) your only option is to transmit a private key. You would then have to trust the receiver to take the correct amount. This would be the equivalent of opening your wallet, putting all your cash on the counter and asking them to take the correct amount. 
Also what range does the nfc have? Will someone be able to scan my private key when I walk past them?
But the NFC tag is reprogrammable (right?) so i could keep just small amounts on it and keep rotating private keys.

Every time you want someone to send you bitcoins you create a new address and give them this new address. You do not need to keep track of your addresses, your wallet does this for you. Usually you can give each of your addresses a label if you want to keep track of it. Just remember to back up your wallet. This is very easy with a deterministic wallet. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 10:14:52
Find a 3rd party. You don't even need to trust them. 
Create a transaction (T1) to an address that requires a 2-of-2 multi sign to spend (yours and the 3rd party), but do not broadcast. 
Create an nLockTime transaction (T2) to spend the out put of T1 back to your address. 
Ask the 3rd party to sign T2. 
Broardcast T1. 
Now you have bitcoins locked in an adress that can only be sent back to you (T2) at some time in the future.

My understanding of coloured coins (from a previous link on reddit) is that you put a lot of coins into a bitcoin address. You now call each 1 of these coins something else, shares in a company for example. The coins are then traded as if they are these shares. As long as a coin can be traced back to this account then we know it is a share. But how does this work when bitcoins can be merged and split?
You send me 1 coloured bitcoin. I send this bitcoin plus 1 of my own uncoloured bitcoins to 1 of my other address. I now have a merged semi-coloured 2 bitcoin. I then split this bitcoin into 2 1BTCs by sending 1BTC to someone. What have they just recieved? It's a 1BTC semi-coloured coin.

This is not how the oracle would work at all. 
You want a transaction to pay someone when Joe dies. You would query the oracle and it would say, I'm not signing that transaction, joe is not dead. Therefore your transaction would not get into the blockchain. Then when Joe does die you query the Oracle again. This time the oracle says OK joe is dead. Here is your signed transaction which you then broardcast to be included in the blockchain.

Why should they? When people buy a currency it's usually for a reason. Ie, I'm gong on holiday and need money to spend.

At the moment there simply isn't a market for bitcoins beyond nerds and people betting on the exchange rate.

If the change is always sent back to the sending address it makes the flow of money very obvious. Therefore the change should go to a newly generated random address.
I suppose you could make an exception for a scanned private key (ie paper wallet) but I would not like this to be the standard behavior for all transactions. 
Remember though that paper wallets are not the standard behaviour of bitcoin. If you're going to use them you should learn how change addresses work. Just remember to always backup any wallet app you use and you won't ever lose any bitcoins doing this type of thing. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 11:04:27

Are you sure? See [Neo] (
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:39:08
OK. I'll try to explain with an example.
Someone sends you ฿1. Then someone sends you ฿2. And then you get sent ฿3. You want to send someone ฿3.5.
You don't have a single coin that is greater than the amount you want to send so you need enough coins so the total is equal to or greater than the amount you want to send. 
You create a transaction that says - take this ฿1 coin and this ฿3 coin and send ฿3.5 to my friend's address and ฿0.5 to my change address. 
But then you realise you didn't include a fee. You decide to include a fee of ฿0.1 (to keep the numbers simple). The way the bitcoin network works, there is no way to say:
Use these ฿1 &amp; ฿3 coins. 
Send ฿3.5 to my friend's address. 
Send ฿0.4 to my change address. 
Send ฿0.1 to a miner. 
There is no way to explicitly state how much a miner gets. Instead the transaction says:
Use these ฿1 &amp; ฿3 coins. 
Send ฿3.5 to my friend's address. 
Send ฿0.4 to my change address. 
The bitcoin network then goes (1+3 (in)) - (3.5+0.4 (out)), that equals 0.1 left over, so that must be a miner's fee. That's just how the bitcoin network works. 
Now if you forget your change address the network says (1+3 (in)) - (3.5 (out)), that's 0.5 left over. That 0.5 must be a miner's fee.

I'd like to see some numbers on this because I think it's probabky negligible. If 2 blocks are found at about the same time, miners keep hold of both and continue mining on the 1st 1 they received but will switch to the 1 chain that finds the next block 1st.

See above. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:56:44
Exactly. 
The only solutions I can think of is 
1. Whitelist or blacklist addresses. Ie Only accept green addresses or blacklist coinbase and any other offenders. But as bitcoins are pushed and not pulled this would be difficult to implement. (And I expect a blacklist would be impossible)
2. If a transaction is not received in 30 seconds cancel it. Then if any money is received on that address after that time bounce the money back to the address it come from (using a different receiving/merchant address for each transaction). 
But I am interested if any merchants when the transaction time is a critical factor have thought about this kind of problem and how they'd solve it.

It's only non-trivial to someone who doesn't have the power to question you. 


If this is true the police could expect you to give details of that transaction and all the info you have on their identity. They'll do the rest of tracing him down. But if you can not give any details of the transaction, what it was for, how you found out about them, how you communicated, well ...


I think this is bang on the money. 


The more transactions the more your coins get mixed and the harder it is to trace back to you.

Wow. I honestly didn't set out to make any point.

I think at 1 point you said we can't prove that, but we can. There are polls all the time to find out public opinion. If there hasn't been 1 on this subject then you can not make this claim because no one knows until we do, do a poll on this subject. 


Again I don't know what this means and that I was.


No. Just evidence based claims


I don't think i've argued any political point yet - but I do think there will always be some form of government because I would want to work with my neighbours to keep our patch nice. And I do agree current governments are starting to get too big for their boots.  


Agreed. Things should change (but there is always someone saying that} but I don't think it will be a big step change. It will be a slow transition and most people wont even notice.

No. I did mean bip32. 
A brainwallet is where you remember a passphrase and how to generate the private key from that passphrase. 
The easiest way is Electrum or Amory mnemonics. They give you a 12 word passphrase to remember and/or write down. 
Some people take a passphrase then sha256 it (but I've never liked this method).
All of the above methods can be used at 
I liked using pbkdf2, but there is no easy method of using this. 
BIP 32 describes Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets and includes a method of generating the master key from a passphrase. 
There is also bip 39 for generating mnemonics. 
Both the electrum and armory methods are being depreciated in favour of bip39. 
Bip38 is a method of encrypting private keys.

A private key is usually displayed in Base 58 Wallet Import format. Which basically means it looks something like this

This private key is what allows you to spend money from the address it relates to. It can be imported into nearly any wallet (not just mycelium). 
Mycelium exports these via a QR code you can scan, copy it to the clip board or save as a jpg image.

This completely changes the question. I've never had a transaction (including zero fee transactions) take longer than 24hr (and obviously 6 confirmations about 50min after that). If you're selling non-digital goods online waiting 24hr to post an item is not overly excessive. 
A transaction in a brick and mortar store would need to complete in about 30 seconds. I expect what would happen for low cost b&amp;m sales is the customer makes the payment and the store accepts a 0 confirmation transaction when they see the raw transaction broadcast to the network. 
But the problem with coinbase is that it hasn't been broadcasting the transaction immediately. Therefore the store would be unable to confirm a payment had been made. Then sometime later (long after the 30 second requirement i set above) coinbase will broardcast the transaction.

This could be called a scam. 
A gateway can always cover it's IOUs unless doing fractional banking or pulling a scam. 
A gateway in it's purest form is exchanging something real for it's digital counterpart and vice versa, ie I send USD (via bank transfer) to the gateway and receive USD in ripple. I send USD in ripple to the gateway and receive USD to my bank account. 
Now if we're taking gold, I would send gold to the gateway and receive gold in ripple. If I send gold via ripple the gateway posts some gold to me. 
But your gateway could also be an exchange say USD/gold. I could send USD to buy some ripple-gold. When I send this gold back to the gateway via ripple they could post me gold or send me the value of that gold in USD. 
If at any point you do not have the USD or gold owed to me by your gateway it means you have been doing fractional banking with that currency/commodity (or pulling a scam).

You are wrong. 
1st, why are you talking about cash and gold. You do not need 2 things of value for frb. 
2nd, you can owe more than you have. This is called frb. 
3rd, you keep taking about a double spend. This is a bitcoin/blockchain thing and all it means is bitcoins can not be copied, so you can not send the same bitcoin twice. 
Frb works like this. 
I am a bank. Lots of people send bitcoins to my banks bitcoin address. I now own ask these bitcoins. 
I keep records of who is owed how much from my bank. 
People come to me for loans. I update my records to say they now have the bitcoins I am lending to them (but I still have all the bitcoins in my banks bitcoin account). Everyone else just has an account with my back that I keep the records for. 
My bank now owes more money than it has. But as long as everyone doesn't try to take their bitcoins out of my bank at the same time all is good. I can give people the little amounts of bitcoin they take out from time to time.

True. 
But not everyone is convinced that the claimed quantum computers are actually quantum computers and even if it is, it's still way underpowered to break the ECDSA signatures. I'll worry about this when it starts to look like quantum computers and nearly powerful enough to break this encryption. My current opinion is that revealing your public key changes and attackers probability of spending your bitcoins from 2* impossible (or is that 3 times?) to just 1* impossible.

Forks are caused when 2 miners both find a valid block at about the same time. You then have to wait for another block to be found to find out which is going to be accepted as the valid/longest chain. 
Everyone can check blocks are valid. The chain that is considered valid is the longest one that does not contain invalid blocks/transactions.

Or destroyed. You are trying to protect your keys from 2 things. 1. Theft. 2. Loss. I can never forget my brain wallets and the private keys only exist in my head. The only problem is death. There are multiple solutions to this but all are going to slightly increase your risk of theft (the aim of this game is not to eliminate risk but reduce it to an acceptable level). 1 solution is to print out your brain wallet as a paper wallet. A kind of hybrid paper-brain wallet. It's a paper wallet that you can recreate from memory, but in the event of your death you have explained to someone how they can retrieve your savings.

No. A transaction must spend the full amount of its inputs. 


An unspent output is like a bill/note/coin. 


Nothing. The transaction you create will not contain that new "coin" (unspent transaction output) and it will still be available for you to spend after you have broadcast the transaction you are currently sending. 
Have a read about transactions, inputs and outputs.

This is not wrong. Let's say we do move to scrypt and the majority of miners (in terms of hash power) say a big f u. They stay on the current version using sha256. The new version will only accept scrypt and the old version will only accept sha256 blocks. Assuming your transactions are still sent to all nodes then to start with both blockchains will record the same transactions. But at some point they will diverge (a double spend either by accident or on purpose). Which coins have value now?

Fair point. But 1 of the goals of bitcoin is that there is no 3rd party risk. Ripple does not offer this. So far the only solution we have to this is a block chain with proof of work and that costs energy.


I don't think either is designed to be more robust than the other. Ripple is designed to take the money in your pocket and digitise it. Bitcoin is designed to be a new digital currency with no 3rd party risk.

You can buy or earn bitcoins. A lot of people *still* think mining is free bitcoins. It's not. It's being paid for processing bitcoin transactions. At current hash rates, you'll probably be paid less than your investment plus electricity costs and therefore never make a return on your investment.

Coinbase and inputs.io. The online/hosted wallets that you do not have the private keys to. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 09:08:39
The linked [article]( is not about a method of producing random numbers or generating random keys. It's about selecting a nonce for use in a signature. 
I don't know how much you guys know, so I'll start from the beginning. A signature requires a nonce (in this case, any number that is unknown to everyone else) in order to keep the private key secrete. If you create 2 signatures from the same private key and both signatures use the same nonce, you have just given away enough information to solve a set of equations to find that private key. 
Currently we select nonces at random and this is where the problem with low entropy random numbers comes in. 
I can select a random number by rolling a dice. On the 2nd roll I have a 1 in 6 chance of rolling the same number. I can select random 1s and 0s by tossing a coin. On the 2nd toss I have a 1 in 2 chance of tossing the same number. The coin has lower entropy. 
The proposal in this article is to select nonce values deterministically. Ie, by a hash of the private key.

I have seen a proposal somewhere so that if you are receiving a transaction that hasn't included a mining fee (or any transaction actually, it doesn't have to be a zero fee transaction) you can use this unconfirmed transaction as an input to another transaction sending it to another one of your addresses. In the transaction you create you include a mining fee. Then when calculating that priority of transcstions the 1st transaction will take into account the fee of the 2nd transaction, which basically allows you to add mining fees to transactions being sent to you.

This subreddit is a strange place. Banks are hated. Coinbase and inputs.io are loved because
1. They offer instant transactions
2. They keep transactions off the blockchain
Even though they are basically operating as unregulated, uninsured banks. 
Mention ripple and you will be down voted to oblivion even though it offers the same benefits as coinbase and inputs.io with the same level of risk.

The mixing website 1st asks, over how long of a period do you want your coins returned to you.
It then randomly chooses a number between say 10 &amp; 100. This is the number of transactions. The site then chooses random dates and amounts to meet the above 2 criteria. Amounts will only be in ฿100, ฿10,  ฿1, 100m฿, 10m฿ or 1m฿ amounts. And each will be to a different address. 
The site then products a gpg signed receipt. The receipt will contain the address you need to send to, the schedule of payments that will be sent to you and the private keys of the addresses they will be sent to. This receipt will not be saved by the site. 
All the payments are marked as pending payment until money is received at the receive address. 
When the full balance is received at the receiving address any information linking the receive address with the addresses to be paid is deleted. Now the only information linking the receiving address with the out payment addresses is in the signed receipt held by the customer (in case of any problems with the mixing service). The pending payments are marked as active and processed on the due date. 
When all payments are received by the customer the receipt can be destroyed. 
The only problem is if the customer imports all the private keys into the same wallet. If anyone obtains this wallet they can then match the amount of bitcoins sent to the mixing service and the amount received by this wallet.

Miners are just doing 2*sha256. Assuming sha256 is not broken the only reason to change would be because the network is finding block hashes too quickly (and the difficulty would have to be at the hardest possible - all hashes = 0). I'm not sure if this could ever happen but you could just change to 4*sha256. Just a software update for those asics. If sha256 does become broken then miners have an incentive to move to another hash.

This isn't even true. Proving a transaction has not been double spent is dependent on the amount of proof of work you have following your transaction. With smaller block confirmation times you have to wait for more blocks for the same level of security. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 07:15:50


Yes. Otherwise it could be very easy to crack. 
A bip32 wallet does not need to be seeded by a passphrase though. It can be a random private key, but you only need to backup this 1 (extended private) key to backup every account. You could have 1 account for each bitcoin wallet you use. It also allows interesting things like sharing only the extended public key of any account. From this key you can work out every address for that account but can't find the corresponding private keys.

Good explanation for the layman but the blockchain does not record balances, only transactions. A better analogy is owning gold coins. When I want to make a transaction I take some gold coins that are equal to or greater than what I want to send. I then melt them all down together and make 2 or 3 new coins. 1 of the value I want to send, an optional 1 for a transaction/miners fee and what's left as change for myself.

Nodes just rebroadcast valid transactions and blocks. Miners (here I refer to miners at solo miners) collect valid transactions and try to find a valid block. In pooled mining the act of validating trandactions and collecting them into a block, and finding the block nonce is split between the pool operator and the workers.

Agreed. But xrp can never be worth very much. If the price increases so would the price of opening a ripple account as there is a minimum xrp reserve. Therefore they would have to lower the minimum reserve. Then I and a lot of others find they have a lot of excess xrp that they don't need. This excess xrp would be put on the market and could even under cut the price open coin (ripple labs) are selling xrp at. Which would cause the price of xrp to drop again. Xrp is never going to be worth a lot. It is not the store of value that bitcoin is.

There's not enough information on the site so I'm going to hazard a guess. 
The card is an NFC card with a one time pin (OTP). The merchant downloads an app on their mobile phone. The phone read the NFC and you enter the OTP. The app sends the card details and OTP along with the transaction details to them. They verify the card. The transaction details are then used to instruct your hosted wallet that they hold for you to produce the transaction. 
Am I right?
I've never liked this idea of giving the merchant all the information they need to take however much they want from my account. At least with credit/debit cards I have some comeback. With this system if the merchant uses a dodgy app that says it's charging me 1BTC but then instead charges 10BTC I have no come back. Those coins are gone.

You can not create 2 public keys/addresses from the same private key. 
1 private key -&gt; 1 public key -&gt; 1 address. 


From the private key you can work out the 1 and only address related to that key.

Confiscation of mobile/computers could reveal that you own this address but I think a more likely situation is this (depending on the seriousness of the crime). You are the only identity that can be linked to an address that is linked to some illegal activity. Although the money wasn't transfered from you to them directly the police want to know who you sent money to and for what purpose? Think fast or it could look suspicious. Also a bitcoin transaction alone probably would not be enough evidence to convict you of anything, but it could add to the evidence.

There is a 256 bit private key, a 256 bit public key and the address is a hash plus checksum of the public key. It is not useful including a public key in a paper wallet as it is only used to spend and derive the address. As spending also requires the private key and the public key can be derived from the private it's pointless to put the public on the paper wallet. It is useful however to include the address so that you are able to send to the wallet without having to import/reveal your private key just to find the address.

Blockchain.info is what known as a hybrid wallet. They only have access to your encrypted keys and can not decrypt them. Decryption is done client side. (There is a small risk Thai could rewrite their software to steal your password, but so far there is no evidence of this). I see it more as a wallet backup and sync service.

Did you not get the memo? We are all already using millibits. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 11:17:16
I don't think it is being used yet. My understanding is that it will allow transactions to addresses that can then only be spent with n-of-m signatures. This allows things like escrow to be built into the bitcoin protocol. You move your coins to an address that requires 2-of-3 signatures to move the coins - yours, the recipient and an arbitrator. When you receive your goods the transaction only needs a signature from you and the recipient to move the funds to the recipient. No action is required from the arbitrator. If a transaction is disputed the arbitrator signature plus a signature from either you or the recipient can move the funds.

Ripple can do a currency conversion at the same time as a transaction, using buy/sell offers that other people using ripple have made. From your point of view you will login to your ripple account and create a transaction to send €10 to the address of your German friend. Ripple will then look at what currencies you have and the buy/sell offers on the network and tell you your options. Ie, you can send €10, ฿x, $y or £z.

I think that when they get a charge back, if they are actually shipping, they are going to use that as evidence to reverse the chargeback. However, due to distance selling laws (in the UK) you can return the stuff and get a refund. You don't even have to give a reason why you're returning it.

@_date: 2013-10-16 23:41:36
I don't know how often this might happen but it would rely on an attacker keeping hold of transactions that have been dropped from mempools. Your wallet app could ignore the fact that a transaction has been dropped and just carry on with the next nonce. It would make restoring more complicated because you'd have to check if the nonce you want to use next has been used in the last few transactions (ie, 1 (or more) were skipped due to a dropped transaction). 
I don't know though. I'm not trying to turn this proposal into a working concept just trying to explain what that proposal is suggesting. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:40:00
You've just almost described a key derivation function. Ie, a function that iterates a hashing function. Starting with a hash of a passphrase then hashing the hash. 
My preferred method is:
Private_key = pbkdf2(hmac-sha1, passphrase1, passphrase2, 4_digit_pin+10000)
Edit: technically it's a passphrase and a salt, but in the case of a brain wallet I like to remember both and consider them as passphrase1 and passphrase 2.

So when you create the transaction you then create a hash of that transaction. The hash has to be less than some target such that the hash will take a few second to find. Then send the transaction with hash. That's not a bad idea.

But the coloured coin still has to be backed by some 3rd party so you might as well use ripple. I don't see any problem with using a gateway to move your bitcoins into ripple then buying a coloured coin in ripple. Using ripple also means you could pay in any currency, not just bitcoins.

It depends on the size of the dictionary. I don't know about electrum but diceware uses 7776 word which mean 12 random words from that dictionary is 155 bits of entropy. A bitcoin private key has 256, but the hash of the address is 160. So 12 words from that dictionary is about the same as bitcoin uses anyways.

Steroids are anti-inflammatory. Therefore it is quite obvious that when some one has a head injury from say a car crash and their brain starts to swell, we should give them steroids to reduce the inflammation. So obvious in fact that no one bothered to do a randomised trial. when some one finally did decide to do a randomised trial they found that steroids did not improve survival rates and in fact may actually slightly reduce them. We can play this anecdotal game all day. The fact is the sample size is too small to draw any conclusions.

While you have answered the question that, from just the information contained in the blockchain you can not link addresses to the same deterministic wallet, not all of your statements are 100% accurate. 


Bip32 wallets can make use of extended *public* keys that can calculate all of the addresses in its subtree, but can not find the corresponding private keys. 


Extended public keys allow this. 


While there is a infinite number of paths it's unlikely a bip32 wallet will select addresses at random because this would make importing a wallet very difficult. They are more likely to allow the user to setup as many account as they want then these accounts and their addresses with be selected sequentially making the key space search much smaller.

Don't sorry about it. You don't need to know what mining is to get started using bitcoins. 


You will not get large amounts of bitcoins from mining. There's no such thing as a free lunch. 


Bitcoin has no concept of accounts. This is a web based wallet. 


This is a bitcoin address. If you want someone to send you money, you tell them to send it to this address. 


I do not know what you are trying to say here.

Nice 1. I never thought of it from this point of view. An attacker would still have to try all private keys as without working it out there is no way of knowing which keys will produce the same address.

I like some of these ideas. Everyone has stuff already floating about in their head that they will never forget and therefore can make a good memorable secure password out of. The reason i like Diceware though is that it produces a passphrase that is completely unrelated to me. But do you think the majority of people using brain wallets are using secure enough passphrases? And if bitcoin becomes widely accepted, with sites such as blockchain.info and brainwallet.org promoting brain wallet, will the majority of people still use secure enough passphrases?

1 billion people start creating addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second without producing any duplicates.
In order for me to have a 1 in 1 billion chance of randomly creating a collision they would have had to have created 1 billionth of all the address.
There are 2^160 addresses. 1 billionth of this is 2^160 / (10^9 ).
Time to create this 1 billionth of all addresses is 2^160 / (10^9 )/60/60/24/356 = 4.6*10^13 years.
So 1 billion people creating addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second will take 46344 billion years before they even have a 1 billion to 1 chance of creating a collision.

@_date: 2013-09-29 23:56:29
To answer some of your questions you need to understand some of the fundamental details of how bitcoin works. i think you are missing some information. I'll try to explain. 
A bitcoin wallet will generate private keys randomly. From the private key can be worked out the public key and form this the address can be calculated. From the public key you can not work out the private key.
Anything encrypted by the public key can only be unencrypted by the private key. Not even the key used to encrypt it (the public key) can unencrypted it.
And anything encrypted by the *private* key can only be unencrypted by the *public* key. Not even the key used to encrypt it (the private key) can unencrypted it. This is used for digital signatures.
A signature is when you take a hash of the thing you want to sign then encrypt the hash with the private key. To check the signature you hash the thing that has been signed, unencrypt the signature using the public key and check they match.
When sending a bitcoin transaction, it is signed with the private key of the address it is being sent from. The public key also needs to be included in the transaction. Anyone can check the signature is valid by using the public key. But without the private key no one can tamper with the signature. After checking the signature is valid you can check the public key is the correct public key for the sending address. Therefore proving that the transaction was sent by someone that has access to the private key for that address.
**Now to answer some of your questions.**


Yes, but If your private key was generated randomly, don't worry about it.


A brainwallet is when you take a passphrase and use some method to turn it into a private key. Electrum and Armory both give you a random 12 word passphrase that they use to calculate a private key. Both of these are being depreciated in favour of [BIP70]( that describes a standard way to turn a mnemonic into a private key. A lot of people like to use sha256. I liked to use a key derivation function such as pbkdf2. [BIP32]( (HD wallets) also describes a method of doing this.


Hopefully the description above explains this.


No one knows unless you've done the work to try and attack them.


Brainwallets? They don't.


It's just a method of remembering a private key.


It doesn't.


The bitcoin network does not know if anyone knows the private key of an address that bitcoins are transferred to.


See it is. see below.


You can not unless you are trying to attack it as described below.
**tldr** - Bitcoin addresses are generated by
Private key -&gt; Public key -&gt; Address
The private key is usually generated randomly.
In a brain wallet you have
Passphrase + some method -&gt; Private key
Some method could be sha256 for example.
To attack brainwallets I can make a list of passphrases and sha256 them. I now have a list of private keys. From these keys i can work out their addresses. I can now watch the blockchain for any money being sent to these addresses and when it is, i have the private key that allows me to transfer it somewhere else.

There are many ways to answer this question, but basically bitcoin is a new (ish) digital currency. It has a lot of the properties of cash (only the person that owns the bitcoins can hand them over to someone else). Bitcoins are also part of a distributed peer to peer system. Unlike a bank that could freeze your money, bitcoins can not be frozen.

And if bitcoin becomes widely accepted money laundering is going to become extremely difficult to police.

1. At this moment in time the only real reason is as an investment. Bitcoins *might* holder their value better than fiat (or might even increase in value).

No. People are flawed. Everyone has a broken random number generator (just like android had) meaning that people can not generate passphrases with a high enough entropy. Instead we need to rely on dice ([diceware]( or other sources of randomness. 


Don't. You should use bitcoins properly 1st. To use a brain (or paper) wallet without the risk of losing bitcoins you should have a good understanding of how the bitcoin network works  (and how to generate strong passphrases). If someone doesn't know how to setup their own brainwallet, they probably shouldn't be using 1. 
You'd be better off setting up a wallet app and backing it up for them (even keep hold of a backup for them if they're OK with that). Or a paper wallet and tell them not to spend any without telling you 1st so you can walk them through it the 1st time.

    pbkdf2(hmac-sha1, message, salt, iterations)
And I considered the inputs to this function as:
    message = passphrase1
    salt = passphrase2
    iterations = pin + n (with a pin&gt;10000)
I really didn't write much code. The heavy lifting is all done by python libraries. 
pbkdf2 from here: 
PyBtcEngine from here:  
    from getpass import getpass
    from pbkdf2 import pbkdf2_hex
    from pybtcengine import PyBtcAddress
    p1 = getpass()
    p2 = getpass()
    pi = int(getpass())
    k = pbkdf2_hex(p1, p2, pi, 32)
    a = PyBtcAddress().createFromPrivateKey(int(k, 16)).getAddrStr()
Or for working with bip32 wallets
pycoin from here: 
This example just creates bip32 derived keys from a single passphrase
    from getpass import getpass
    from pycoin import wallet
    p=getpass()
    m = wallet.Wallet.from_master_secret(p)
    account=m.subkey_for_path(r'0')
    account.wallet_key()       # extended public key for the account m/0
    account.wallet_key(True)   # extended private key for the account m/0
    address=m.subkey_for_path(r'0/0/0')
    address.bitcoin_address()  # address for the key m/0/0/0
    address.wif()              # private key for the key m/0/0/0
I'm also thinking of creating a bip32 wallet using a key stretching method similar to above. So the master seed would be derived by
    pbkdf2(hmac-sha1, message, salt, iterations)
I might even take the 1st account of this wallet and promote it up a level so that it becomes a full bip32 wallet itself. Then if I decide to change wallets for whatever reason, I can just take the 2nd account from the original master key (assuming it has not been compromised of course) and again promote this account to a wallet.

More secure than an ECDSA 256 bit private key?


I think the fees are fair. 


I like the on-blockchain micro payments. 
You don't *have* to use an online wallet or off-chain services. But having said that I do agree with you and I have said before that if bitcoin does become successful we'll see bitcoin banks. 
People that are not as technical will not understand how secure bitcoin is and/or they will not trust themselves to not lose the private keys. People have been told all their lives that banks are a safe place to store money (I'm not arguing that they are/aren't safe, just that a lot of people perceive them to be). Then when a lot of people are using bitcoin banks they'll think you are the crazy one for not using a bank. 
I do find the bitcoin community to be very hypocritical though. I have no problem with ripple, although I wouldn't keep a large among of bitcoins in it. I don't think xrp will ever hold value like bitcoin does though, but I don't think that is where the value of ripple is. Yet a lot of bitcoiners will harshly attack ripple but not online bitcoin wallets. 
I don't see much difference between ripple and an online wallet. With both someone else manages your keys and issues you with bitcoin IOUs. And both have off-chain instant bitcoin transactions. 
But back to the point. These online wallets could be considered bitcoin banks. They could even be doing fractional reserve right now without us knowing.

I do not see a problem with this. I consider it similar to a cheque. With a cheque you have to cash it in to move the money from 1 accont to another. Anyone that knows what they're doing knows they have to sweep a paper wallet as soon as they receive it. Anyone that doesn't sweep it probably doesn't understand bitcoins and/or the value of bitcoin and there is a real risk they'll lose it.

True. But this is not the only method of generating private keys. You can generate them deterministically from a seed (some call it the master private key). BIP32 is 1 such example. 




It's not. 


An offline wallet needs your address(es). To feed your address(es) to the wallet you can either
1. Just enter your address(es)
2. Give it your private key(s). It will then work out your address(es) and delete your private key(s)
3. Give it your seed/master key. It will work out your private keys and addresses then delete your private keys and seed.

A HD brain wallet. Use a very long passphrase as a memorable seed and/or print the master key and/or encrypt the master key (gpg or truecrypt) and/or put the encrypted matter key on dropbox.

Have a look here: 
For a compressed public key you also need to append to the end the byte 0x01 after step 2. 
So for an uncompressed public key the private key wif is: 
    Base58Check(0x80 + private key) 
For a compressed public key the private key wif is: 
    Base58Check(0x80 + private key + 0x01)
(This assumes the checksum is part of the Base58Check.

I see what your saying. I don't consider this kind of transaction off-chain because T1 is on the chain and at any point in time there is a T3  (or T2) transaction waiting to be sent. What I consider off-chain is coinbase to coinbase, inputs.io to inputs.io, mtgox to mtgox. Ie those transaction done internally by 3rd parties.

Most people would just sha256 the passphrase. For that you can use:
 (brainwallet tab)
But I've never liked this method. I would prefer to use a key derivation function such as pbkdf2 and say hmac-sha1 (or as it has been proposed by bip32 hmac-sha512).
Unfortunately I haven't found an easy to use tool to generate these hashes and instead used Python. (There is also Java, libraries exist for both). 
If you are on Linux there are hashing tools on the command line (although probably not a key derivation function) but I think you run the risk of unknowingly putting a new line on the end of your passphrase using this method. 
On windows you could download msysgit (as it contains gpg, you might be able to just download git for windows but I've never done that). From the bash command line you can use 
    git --md-print
But you probably have the same new line risk as above (and again, not a key derivation function). 
I've just done a quick search on android and found
[Password msnager](
[Hash decrypt](
If anyone knows of any apps that run a key derivation function on any platform I'd be interested to know.

A fork wouldn't necessarily create 2 new networks. It's more likely both versions would accept the same transactions until you end up with a double spend and each network choosing different transactions as the valid one. Form this point on the 2 blockchains would slowly diverge.

You could try the following. 
1. Create a multi-sig address that requires 2 signatures both the buyers and sellers. 
2. The seller sends coins to the address equal to the value of the item being sold. 
3. The buyer sends twice the value of the item to the same address. 
4. The seller sends the item.
5. When received the buyer and seller sign a transaction to send the value of the item to the seller and return both the buyers and sellers stake.

Part of the problem of tracking stolen coins is that there isn't really such a thing as a "coin" in bitcoin. 
Imaging the following analogy. We use gold coins. But a gold coin transaction works like this. I have 2 gold coins. I want to give you 1.5 gold coins. I have to melt down 2 gold coins and make a 1.5 gold coin and a half gold coin. 
Now imagine I have 1 BTC and someone gives me a stolen bitcoin. I now have 2 1BTC coins (or more accurately I own the outputs of 2 transactions each worth 1BTC. When I send you 1.5BTC the transaction that is created uses both 1BTC outputs and creates new outputs, 1 of 1.5BTC going to you and 1 of 0.5BTC going to me. Now this 1.5BTC "coin" that I just sent you, is it a stolen coin or not?

Encouraging single receive would indirectly encourage single send. 
Let's say you enforce single receive (to make the example a little simpler). Then each address would only every have 1 receiving transaction and therefore 1 unspent output. To spend from the address you would have to use the full amount and return change to a new address.

Because if bitcoins are truly deflationary then at some point you will have the exact same problem.
