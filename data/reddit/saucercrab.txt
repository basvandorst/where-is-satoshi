Okay, I obviously didn't spend enough time with the map before posting ;)
 
When zoomed in, I saw icons for a Bus Station, a Bank, and two mysterious icons (which I now realize are ATM icons that I overlooked in the legend). Since these mystery icons both returned a "Cajun and BBQ" joint, I assumed something was wrong. 
All is good now. I'm simply stoned.

I just read the entire G+ exchange but still don't understand why Coinbase is "worse than PayPal." 
From what I've read, their shortcoming are simply due to having to adhere to US law. So far, my experience as a buying platform has been great. I can understand some people wanting a more secure wallet to *store* BTC, but as for easy (but slow) trades, Coinbase is the only option for some. I'd appreciate more info...

Speaking of, I'm interested in purchasing something from a bitcoin forum and the seller has offered another user "as escrow."
What exactly does this mean? I would actually send the bitcoin to the 3rd party until receiving my item? How do I know the two aren't in cahoots? (I don't have much history with private sales online but am curious about a way to insure this purchase.)

It's getting to where people can't even comment on this site anymore. I *knew* some badass was going to make some big, brave comment about how we're all free to choose, maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan. 
Eat a dick. There's nothing wrong with complaining about services offered, *especially* in a case like this, where eBay DOES have a veritable monopoly on the online auction industry. I'm not pissed about the 10%. Or the 3%. It's the fact that they're double-dipping. I spent $23.70 on a knee-jerk decision to take the convenient and preferred method of payment, never imagining I'd be charged *again* for my sale. It would have been cheaper to fucking WIRE money, like it's 1980. 
It's reasons like this we need Bitcoin. 
And fuck you, again.

Thanks for taking the time to reply. Everything I've read has mentioned creating a wallet for the recipient, but I was hoping HE would take the time to do so as part of the learning process. It also seem like it would spoil the surprise... I know his email and could use a temporary password, but he'd still get a notification of account creation, right?
Can I not just include instructions on the flash drive for doing so, along with a simple .txt file containing the private key?

I've seen the term ASIC thrown around a lot but never bothered to look it up.
Thanks for your reply - this answers my questions!

Okay thanks again for the help... I'm understanding the relationship between keys, addresses, and the block chain a bit more now.

I just sold something on eBay for the first time in a couple of years and my ass is *sore.*
I was immediately upset with the 10% cut that eBay takes but could not believe my fucking eyes when I finally received payment via PayPal. 
All in all, my item sold for $600 and I lost $83.70 to the *same company.*

Sorry, I didn't mean Coinbase, I meant Circle. I haven't used Circle to buy yet, but would assume they function similar to Coinbase. 
I've read of inconsistencies in price with CB as well and just assumed it's for the reasons I outlined, but again - I'm not pro. I think this is a downfall of linking to a bank account where it takes time to convert fiat to BTC... which is why CB and others can offer "instant" trading when linked to credit.

Even though this is a bit long, it's good that it's made by an older gentleman (and my step-dad will certainly know who Ted Nelson is). I think a lot of times generational differences can affect people's perception, so a peer-made video might grab his attention faster than one coming from a 20/30-something.

I just purchased my first BTC via Coinbase on this last drop, but have had a Blockchain wallet for quite some time. Is Blockchain a safe place to store them? What about Coinbase's "vault?"
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:28:01
Ha!

The exchange rate for BTC to USD is *constantly* fluctuating. Let's tease an extreme example here: Say I enter checkout with Circle or Coinbase or whatever and am about to complete my purchase of 1 BTC for $360.44 but I let that window sit for two hours on my computer before clicking "purchase." Within those two hours, the buy price falls to $350.33. You've just purchased .97 BTC without realizing it. 
Even though these transactions are FAST, they're not as fast as the market fluctuations (which can only be "locked in" by bidding on an actual exchange). Your purchase through Circle (who is only the broker) may actually take a few seconds behind the scenes, and within those few seconds the price can fluctuate by several dollars. The larger the order, the larger the discrepancy seems.

AVL is small, its economy sucks, and the "locals" can be assholes to transplants (no one is really from there, it's just some weird tradition to haze the newcomers) but the city is a gorgeous, laid back, beer-saturated, little time capsule of art deco and progressive ideology set in one of the most beautiful places on earth.

Dude, I'm not educated enough to explain precisely how this occurs, but I do know why. Contact Circle for an explanation rather than starting polarizing threads across the web. 
With all trades, there is a delay, even on the NYSE. You gave Circle the authorization to deduct X amount of money from your account, correct? They broker a deal with a BTC exchange to purchase coins as close to that dollar amount as possible, but it's not precise. In that short amount of time, the difference between BTC and USD fluctuates, so one of them has to give. Would you be happier if Circle completed your purchase of 3 BTC and then *charged* you more? Because that's the only other option here that keeps THEM from losing money on the exchange. 
EDIT: Changed Coinbase to Circle

Thanks for this suggestion. Part two of this idea will definitely be figuring out the best *way* to give him the bits.

Over the past year, I've read several references to the potential prohibition of cryptocurrencies. 
On what grounds could the US (or any other) government ban such an intangible technology? Would they actually be banning the *transactions* that occur outside of the dollar? 
If such a movement were to gain legislative momentum, does Bitcoin have enough support to fight it?
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:20:09
Yes, as with any trading platform or exchange you are making a purchase - a "[bid]( - for the CURRENT amount; an agreement for the price at the very second you click *purchase*. 
Now I don't know enough about Coinbase to understand why it takes a full week for the transaction to complete, but I'm assuming it has more to do with the banks transferring funds than it does with BTC. 
(I should add that I myself use Coinbase and despite their slow turnaround have been very happy with them so far.)

This might be good. *I* really liked The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, but it left me yearning for a better understanding of how it works... under the hood. That documentary was well-edited and did a great job of capturing the excitement of BTC, but imho, left out some very important analogies for technicalities that some people may be more interested in.

And remember to think of bitcoin as a finite commodity -- like gold -- which has to be virtually mined as such. Since the miners' equipment is starting to get better, the surface gold is going faster. Soon, it will take better (see: expensive) equipment much more energy to mine deeper and deeper down.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:46:40
Currency, no; commodity, yes.
