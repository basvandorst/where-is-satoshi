So only people who have started companies are allowed to have any opinion at all about their experience with a product or service?
Do you not realize that most new businesses are started when an entrepreneur finds problems with the existing offerings?
You are the naïve one here. Steambits is a shitty company.

Actually, we do have no lose lotteries (prize linked saving accounts) in the US, they just aren't nearly as popular.

I was hoping this would be a clock that measured the time in the current block. (At the time of this post it was 275558 o'block.)
Good luck anyway.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

Do we really need a post every time some phishing site appears?
Educating users about phishing in general would be much more effective.
