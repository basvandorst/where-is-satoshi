The hashrate increased because bitmain sold a lot of miners. the difficulty adjusts every 14 days(or rather every 2016 blocks). as soon as the difficulty has adjusted to the increased hashrate, the mempool will fill up a lot again... Here you can see the current difficulty epoch and projected difficulty change:

My point is that the actual reason for the clearing of the mempool is the current block pace. we´re currently 194 blocks ahead of schedule. the mempool will start clogging up again as soon as the diificulty rises by 15% in 3 days.

Well, the current speed is 8m11s so yes, it´s off by a lot. Now you can say is within variability which it sure is but that doesnt change the outcome of the next difficulty adjustment, mempool will clog again.

This is why:

The hashrate has imcreased drastically, thats the main factor. 3 days from now, block times will return to 10 minutes.

No, literally not. 195 blocks too fast right now. the mempool will clog up again as soon as the difficulty rises by 15% in 3 days. Don´t spread conspiracies about alleged spam.

Lmao. Do you even look at the numbers? It´s not clearing because of alleged spammers stopping spam. It´s clearing because transaction demand is shrinking and average block time is way to fast right now. we´re 190 blocks ahead of schedule as i´m writing this.
