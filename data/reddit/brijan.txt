Thanks! I definitely do, especially Hyderabadi biryani.
@_date: 2014-12-06 10:51:40
Thanks, haha but there's more. We're also restricted to pay foreign merchants using Paypal too, so even if I had to buy using Paypal it wouldn't work. We can only send and receive money using paypal to Indian paypal users and some Indian merchants.

Thank you for this post, I realized TeamViewer was a risk. For those who have TeamViewer installed make sure you don't have it running as a service all the time in the background and have a strong password set on it.
The hacker can probably brute-force the users password on Teamviewer, or he probably somehow already knew the users password and searched the user on teamviewer and logged into his PC as VNC and probably could later log into your email if you haven't logged out already. Also if possible set a different email on your teamviewer account. 
Usually few blockchain.info users might have set to make and send automatic backups to their email. This way the user will login to your email and download the wallet backup and have access to it. So even if you have 2FA on blockchain.info and if someone gets access to your wallet backup from your email they can access it without the 2FA auth. [TIL after losing many coins and getting sick over it, that 2fa on a blockchain.info wallet does not apply to the backup file. Please don't make the same mistake. Stop having your blockchain.info wallet send backup files somewhere](
Ensure you have 2FA with a mobile device rather than Email cause if you had 2FA to send to the same email, you'll still be compromised. Use Google Authenticator or SMS service if available in your area.

How do I buy the green version of Trezor? 
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:14:05
Wow that's some pretty good cake there, nice design to be honest. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 03:32:25
Thanks a lot mate! :) I've recently donated to wikimedia.
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:30:44
It's a good move by the company. This should restore the trust lost by the users who have lost their Bitcoins at the time of the private key recovery bug making it less secure.
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:24:54
How're these?
 (It's done on Udemy for free, easy to learn for kids too :

I was there, I'll require a flair there. I asked the Mod, he said I'll need another week to build up my history to get a flair. :(
Edit: It's fine, it's my free contribution for the sake of Bitcoin. Have fun!

Oh yeah forgot about Mycelium local trader, thanks!

Merry Christmas! :D
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:07:50
Very nice tutorials
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:09:00
Glad you got back all your bitcoins! It's upsetting at times to notice such a large Bitcoin wallet company get hacked twice on the same issue. 
Mind if I ask you a question? Have you moved away from Blockchain.info after this incident? or do you plan to continue using them because of the trust that maybe they could still refund the BTC lost due to future hacks on their end?
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:01:17
Oh hmm, so maybe a healthy Bitcoin merchant adoption would be those by smaller and new emerging merchants who intend to use bitcoin's as their primary payment source and for a long term? 
Maybe one good thing about Microsoft accepting Bitcoins would be the popularity and brand image Bitcoin is gaining? I wonder if this will equalize the effect of them selling Bitcoins for fiat. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:11:09
This and lots of other personal reasons. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:52:24
So doesn't this mean that merchant adoption by large companies like Microsoft isn't actually a good thing cause they tend to sell bitcoins instantly for Fiat? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:19:30
Sure, you could do that if you feel it's more affordable. Usually Trezor is much beneficial for those having lots of Bitcoins and are paranoid about storing them on a hosted service without having full control over the private keys.
You could make a bootable USB, install Linux on it, have Electrum installed on it and have your funds on it for cold storage.

3) You can also shop anywhere online using Brawker -   "Create an order for any online merchant. Another user will purchase it in exchange for your bitcoins" - Very good service.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:38:10
This is great news! :D
Time to tip a couple of my buddies on Facebook. Need to figure out how to do it first though.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:05:54
To be honest, I really like the security on Trezor, but I have very few bitcoins, and also I think it costs a bit high. Just my personal opinion about the price. 
It should be a good investment for those who have plenty of bitcoins and are paranoid about storing them on their computer or or a hosted wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:25:34
Yes, the person receiving the Bitcoins will have to find a way to sell them using:
1)  [LocalBitcoin]( 
2) [Unocoin](
3) [Bitquick India](
4) [BtxIndia](
Edit: 5) [Mycelium Local Trader - Android based](
They can receive money via NEFT. Initially it would be better to sell a small amount to see if it works well.
I'm not sure if they'll have to [pay tax]( for this, but it'll be worth to know more on if it is necessary. There's also a suggestion for taxation in terms of VAT for Bitcoins, I think [Livemint article](
Hope this helps
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:54:56
Hey, fortunately yesterday I was browsing on FB and found that there was [BitOasis]( It's still due to launch. They seem to allow Buying and Selling in AED. You can apply for an invitation and they'll send out invites soon. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:47:50
Could you edit the domain name for Green address to : 
or 
Their .com domain doesn't redirect to the .it domain with the https in it for some odd reason. Can someone confirm this?
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:20:22
Depending on where you live there are certain Bitcoin trades and exchanges. I can name some popular ones like Circle, Coinbase, localbitcoins. You can check where to buy or sell bitcoins here depending on your location: 
Also about the film equipment you'll have to search a couple of sites that accept bitcoin as a payment to pay for those equipments, like Overstock.com or tiger direct. Incase you're unable to find the perfect merchant try [Brawker]( it allows you to buy from any merchant using bitcoins. It's like you make the payment in bitcoins, someone else would buy it for you with fiat and then he'd get the bitcoins in return for buying you your film equipments. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:07:23
Ah okay that's where the factor of 51% attack comes.
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:13:48
Setup 2FA, make sure you delete all wallet backups from your email, setup 2FA on your email and keep the wallet backup elsewhere on another device or somewhere safer and encrypted. On blockchain.info account settings make sure to disable Automatic Email Backups if already enabled. 
Set a second password under account settings, so that to send any bitcoins the user will have to enter the second password too. Make sure this one is really unique and strong. It's also better not to set any password hints. If the password hits were set before this would be emailed to you, make sure to delete that too.
You can also set 2FA to be send to your phone via SMS or Google Authenticator rather than the email associated with your account. Also go to debugging under account settings and set PBKDF2 Iterations to 10,000 to make it harder for anyone to brutforce your password. Also, disable TOR IP's if you're not using it. If you have a static IP and if you're 100% sure you will be always on that IP to access your wallet, you can set a whitelist to allow only logins through your static IP.
Were you using Teamviewer or any other software providing access to your PC? probably you'll want to revisit all those apps you have installed and make sure no one's accessing your PC using it.
Also change your blockchain short username to something unpredictable by others. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:33:06
Hey thanks for that, but I get "TX rejected" at the end while broadcasting, could you guide me on this.
It says "Once the transaction has been built you will need to sign the transaction with 2 or more keys using the signing section of the site  "
I see only one private key box in the sign section, how to sign with 2 or more private keys? I just entered one of the private keys of the 3 I generated and entered that transaction code from previous transaction stage

Keep the good work up guys! I liked some of the caricatures designs on your portfolio.
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:05:54
Oh okay, so basically small merchants due to the fear of fall in prices being dumping.

Welcome to the world of bitcoin.
You could try using Electrum on an offline machine or a paper wallet. If you're planning to initially buy a couple of bitcoins find some on Circle.com.  
Here's some to start with
2300 bits @_date: 2014-12-07 09:06:14
Oh damn, that's awful and scary. 
"Basically, they didn't save the private key for that address, so my BTC is still sitting in that address, but the private key for it does not exist."
Was he by any chance using the Mywallet browser extension and it didn't sync using that? or was he using the website?
@_date: 2014-12-19 12:52:32
Awh =/ okay, I already have that extension on my firefox, I was wondering if there were any new updates to it cause I never got any updates on it. So I googled to find it was no longer there.
Thanks anyways!
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:58:12
Merry Christmas to you, your family and one and all! Hope everyone haves a pleasant Christmas and a Happy New year!

Pretty sure that .jar file is some kind of malware, I received one too a couple of weeks ago when I shared my email on the Bitcoin talk forums. ESET NOD32 easily detected it as a malware. Since then I've stopped using that email of mine.
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:57:08
Can someone let me know why does more hashrate secure the Bitcoin network? Is this anyway related to double spending issues and stuff?
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:50:02
Cool! Nice list btw!  :)

Great going with the charity! As usual let us all try to spread the joy of Christmas and New year to the ones who need them the most.
About my gaming experience I've been gaming on both my desktop and Xbox one, I play Counter Strike Go on steam and Watch dogs on the Xbox. So far since the bitcoin purchase on Microsoft has been limited to only the U.S. I wasn't provided with such a payment option from where I live.

Without using hardware, you could always use a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:42:38
I know this may sound silly, but I was wondering without proper access to technology and networks in distance or remote areas how can the poor have access to Bitcoins. Is it worth for them to take the risks of volatility in Bitcoins?
How do we possible and easily make it available to them?
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:44:23
Thanks a lot! it worked well.
It was great trying multi signature wallets. :D

Those buggers! All they do is throw packets at you all day. I would recommend using (D)Dos deflate and a good firewall setup. They often give people the hard time, sorry to hear about your situation.
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:21:40
What's more worse is in India we can't buy anything with a debit card either. We can't shop on foreign merchant websites using debit card, due to the new 3DS security implemented. I can't even use localbitcoins cause there's no one in my area selling bitcoins. So we're almost stuck without having an easy way to buy bitcoins. I heard there's the possiblity to do a NEFT in India using unocoin.com but I am not aware if this is taxed because of the uncertain nature of the RBI here with virtual currencies.
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:56:39
Thanks, actually I messaged him after noticing there wasn't a comment on it, so he told me this "Hi, your history is less than 1 page, would it be OK if you built up your comment history a little more and in a week messaged me asking for a flair again ? Sorry to be awkward."
I agreed to that and told him would contact him after a week, so it's cool :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:33:14
