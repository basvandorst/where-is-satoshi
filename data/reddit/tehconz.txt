If he does he'll discover that his contract doesn’t guarantee any particular speed and the 25mbits is provided on a 'best effort' basis.

Yeah, I think the "Bitcoin is a scam" people need their own numbered camp.
My flatmate is quite interested in Bitcoin, but keeps saying it'll all disappear once it "gets hacked". People are used to movies where "hackers" can break any security in a few minutes by typing things like "bypass encryption" and "override". Or guessing that Satoshi's master backdoor password is his daughter's name.

Apparently Coinbase uses a google API to generate the QR codes and it all happens server side. I wouldn't trust it myself. Run the bitaddress.org HTML in an offline livecd then send your Coinbase BTC to the new address. 
No security is perfect, but I haven't heard of anyone having coins stolen using the above method. I also use bitaddress.org's BIP38 encryption to protect my paper wallets from physical theft, and I store copies in multiple locations in case of fire etc.

To be fair, if we're going to consider SSL / TLS broken I'm much more worried about my online banking than my bitcoins.

I keep my coins in BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, imported into blockchain.info as watch-only. That way when I want to spend I just scan the paper with the blockchain.info Android app.
I like having the online wallet so I can check my balance anywhere, but the security of knowing that even if the key is stolen physically it is still password protected. I honestly haven’t seen may posts saying "My house was burgled and they stole my coins!"

I really hate hearing stories like this. Makes me extra paranoid about having backups of backups of backups though, so I guess thats good. 
Your best bet might be to try and do something about the "corrupt" truecrypt volume, rather than the recycle bin deleted file, can you tell us more about what happened there?

Simple interest, not compounding.

I liked Armory, but found its memory usage to be excessive.
