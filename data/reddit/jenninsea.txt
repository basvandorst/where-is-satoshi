I mean that a small transaction was sent to a Gox hot wallet in late Feb. Now that transaction is being combined with the splitting 180k coins into a final address. Both the tiny transaction as well as the prior split of the 180k coins were sent to the same address.

Well, it's what most people have been expecting so in that way it's not bad news exactly, but it does present some major concerns and issues. I have a feeling tax web sites that keep track of BTC values will become very popular.

Sure, you're in the shade, but you're also still in the desert. You're no longer dying but it's not exactly great, either.

Where did you get that?
ETA: I see it now. The ghash.io, etc. inputs are all older, by several weeks. They also predate when Mt Gox went completely down. This, to me, looks like dust collection along with the splitting of these coins.
Edit2: This is actually further proof that this is Gox moving the coins (not a thief), and that they have access to the addresses. They're now moving coins from the former hot wallets and combining them with what look to be coins from cold storage.

What news are you expecting? And why?
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:56:44
Yes, and a lot of people have been wondering why Huobi is doing it but BTCC wasn't. Seemed fishy, in Huobi's direction. Now it appears to be more legit, and thus one less reason to worry about Huobi.

Apparently the audio is old - from January. This is likely not terribly relevant now, just more info into what might have been going on to prompt Gox's bankruptcy filing.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:45:45
Yep! Took me about 30 minutes last night to wrap my head around what was going on.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:08:51
I can't find the source right now, but at one point Barry Silbert said they were going to take the winning 30k worth of bids and send those in. I could have sworn it was on Twitter, but I can't seem to find it now.

You're quite talented with the delete button. ;) That's usually CEO level.

If you belong to a pool, then you get a share of the coins mined relative to how much "work" you did. This is how most people mine nowadays since the difficulty has gone up so much. If you're mining on your own, you get everything you mine.

This is probably why the markets are crashing right now. Him resigning does not inspire much confidence.

You have it wrong. The "elite" transactions were originally spam that Mt Gox *received* into those wallets. The spammers sent it to Mt Gox, a while ago. Now the transactions are being moved individually, rather than as one lump sum (so "elite" and 50k btc separately, rather than 50,000.elite btc as a total lump). This is apparently a good way to keep track of where coins came from.

Your math is wrong. Second Market received enough bids for just over 48,000 BTC. 20MM/48k = ~$417/coin.
48k source: 
*e* - We don't know the average price of the bids they actually submitted, though. That would be higher than 417.

No, this isn't Huobi. It's BTC Trade, another exchange in China. Huobi will likely follow, but we haven't heard anything from them yet.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:49:27
I also find it interesting that we've heard *not one single account* of someone receiving double payments from Gox. I know anyone actually hacking this malleability issue would likely be smart enough to remain silent, but seriously no one? How likely is it that it was only one person? It's yet another item in my "Gox did not have those coins hacked away from them" list.

Yes this sounds exactly like a CFO of a major exchange: 


Go check this guy's posting history, everyone. He ain't no CFO.

Nice. ;) Wonder how many people get this.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:51:42
There's a thread about that [here](

Someone from ghash.io sent their coins to Gox. (We know that in the final days of Gox, they were still receiving coins from people who had this set up automatically, so that makes sense.) If you look at that transaction, it occurred in late Feb. Now that address is being emptied and sent to a new address, along with a split (of about 5btc) from the 180k coins that have been slowly being split for the last day and a half. It's just being combined, and has nothing to do with ghash.io at this point. No coins are going *to* ghash.io, and the coins coming *from* there are older.

I've heard that most of the higher-volume bots were on Gox, and have been migrating to Stamp. Apparently it's quite a process to set up so they didn't want to move away from Gox until they absolutely had to.

I think a large part of their problem is that they don't have enough employees, and enough programming talent. Sacking half of what they do have would be counter-productive. Otherwise I agree with you.

Individual people make individual mistakes. Collectively - we hope - lawmakers should be able to agree on a set of ideas that works for most everyone, most of the time.
Of course we have highs and lows in that process.

I would love some bits!

Depends on what kind of accounting method you use. Look up rules for "first in, first out" etc.
@_date: 2015-05-15 05:07:04
Lawmakers are - again, we hope - subject to the judgment of those who vote for them. That means that their decisions are not "worth" the same as an individual decision by some random person. It is not a perfect system and I don't claim it is, but it's better than letting people hang by their own rope. Or bootstraps, as it were.

I'm no help on the tablet part, but wanted to point that Square only accepts bitcoin for its online marketplace. Their in-person app does not accept bitcoin at this point and AFAIK they have not announced if/when it will.

"I think November ... not the Winklevoss, but the Second Market ETF" at 24:10. Doesn't sound very definite to me.

Maintained is the wrong word, I suppose. It's no longer updated. The owner stopped working on it. That's why it's missing some key (newer) exchanges and trading pairs. It's still my favorite, but I use cryptowat.ch more nowadays.

Bitcoinwisdom is no longer maintained and hasn't been for a long time (1 year+). BTC-e being on there should not, necessarily, be seen as a current endorsement.
