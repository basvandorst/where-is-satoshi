You are wrong, 85 satoshi per byte is not so small it wouldnt even broadcast. Even 4 satoshi per byte would show up on an explorer..

Hi, I am one of the people that posted on the GitHub and my funds are lost. I am also an advanced user. See my thread for more details.
To address something you said:
"Other issues include people not having received payments they were expecting but which weren't actually sent out on the chain..."
This specific part you say above casually and brush over is actually the major issue, the transactions are not actually sent on the chain, but it is deducted from people's balances. That is not user error, it is software side. So someone sends and the other doesn't receive, the balances have been deducted from sender but not received on the receiver. Receiver unable to get a confirmation and balance keeps disappearing and sender is unable to resend for the same reason. In either case, the coin has not been sent or broadcast on blockchain yet funds are gone within the wallet.
Convenient that suddenly now copay is answering our threads with this reply now that it was gaining traction on Reddit:
"We are currently experience synchronization issues between our servers and the blockchain because of low tx fees. We are working hard to resolve them, but it can take a few weeks before your transactions to show up. If you need your wallet in a synchronized state immediately do the following:
Send your balance to (***...address removed due to possible scam***...)
Use a higher than normal fee for this transaction.
Our systems will give preference to this transaction and returns the coins to your wallet. This might take up to 30 minutes."
The thing is I have no more balance to send out, neither does the sender and I'm damn well not keeping any additional funds in Copay to send and play around with. Will update when I hear more

Guys replying to myself. Do not send funds to 1Copay address above. It is a scammer who is not affiliated with Copay. Everyone on the GitHub is saying his profile was created today. Be careful!

You're too blinded or too stubborn to even read all the people's issues. If you read them you would realize the people who have issues are advanced users that can clearly be seen by the way the problem was described. Various threads have been linked showing the problem is clearly copay. Move on.

Different clientele and different needs.
Some people prefer to use an exchange where everything is public and they have all your information. This is cheaper but there is a loss of privacy. The information can handed over to another party at any time (ie Coinbase, or recently Bitfinex). This method is fast, but not nearly as quick as an ATM (assuming your accounts are fully verified).
Some people prefer to use an ATM for buys and sells. Liquidity is more difficult for the operator, a large float is required, wild fluctuations affect the bottom line, there are rents, insurance, licenses (depending on country). These fees must be factored in, hence the higher prices. Often the ATM providers don't make much at all. From a users perspective, they are alot more private. Over certain amounts, KYC is required but often (smaller transactions) it is not (country dependent).
The beauty of this space is there are many different options to get your coin

These scans are all over Canada. I would estimate millions have been paid to the scammers. They originate in India

Looking at a roulette wheel thinking black will come because 3 blacks in a row came is not the same as following market cycles which always go through the same cycles, Google what a market cycle is. No offence but your logic is flawed

No offence but this guy is a bit too far on the opposite side. Feels like a 50+ year old guy that barely believed the internet is real and won't put his credit card online. I can tell you in my business we use crypto each and every day, it is very real and has real use cases. 
Also, I can discredit what he said when he says Bitcoin and crypto were "marketed". Shitcoins and scam coins sure, but scams happen every day but the real king, Bitcoin was not marketed in this sense or at all.
Also, this person had the luxury of living in the first world I can tell by his post. He doesn't understand what it means to have your countries currency be more volatile than BTC, or the government to freeze and control your funds. There is a need for freedom like this globally .
Lastly, blockchain is absolutely unique to crypto, the biggest use case being Bitcoin. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking they are seperate, and one is a scam and one isn't

Once again, your personal bias is causing you think some how Bitcoin is different cyclically then other technoligical innovations, in their early days. The same could have been said about the internet  and wireless technology . To each their own
