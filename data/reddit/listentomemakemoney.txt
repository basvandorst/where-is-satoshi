it has already been established fact that the next big move will be DOWN DOWN DOWN. And not just tiny crash, a big one. If you smart, short now, like I did (and use big margin, 20x at least :D ) :). The bubble already happened to 780. There is no way the bubble has to come. It look exactly like 2013 chart. Everyone with 2 eyes and 1 brain can see and calculate it. In 2013 it was also big bubble (1200), then it went down, bull trap, a bit of sideways, and then mega crash :). 
Happenes now too; 780 is bubble. Then there was crash. Then bulltrap to around 700. Then sideways for weeks (now). And after the hype was over (then it was media, now it is halving), it crashed HARD.
Will happen again, haha :).
Bitcoin fegs will be so disappoint wehn the big crash comes and all hope (and monie) gone, lel :D.
Nothing easier then making sure FOOSL are parted with their monie in bitcoin trading xD

Bullshit wishful thinking. Website is a well known bull whale manipulator. Do opposite of what this website says, it will crash, trust me :). (I know someon who caommitted suicide based on thise website).

Because most people expect it to go up, but it already went up last time it tightened, plus the hype of halving is over :). If everyone expect it go up, there will be very few buyers when it actually goes up as everyone who expected that movement has already bought in and is currently holding their bags in anticipation of dumping it on none-existing new buyers. The true whales know this, and they know there is NO ROOM left for upward movement, so they'll DUMP their bags (which they purchased much cheaper) once the time is right.
This will dump hard. Believe me. Already opened 20x leverage short. If you are smart do the same. This years pump already happened (780), 650 will be the top for now, next move is DOWN DOWN DOWN.

Like i said next big move is all the way down, you will see. I only need be correct once and will be rich, and this is that once :). You fools are greedy ones thinking it will go up   . Anything above 500 is ARTIFICIAL no reason for price stayibg at these levels much longer with hyping gone.
