I think those two things:
1. Control of the network
2. Ruining the network
Go hand in hand. You couldn't control it without destroying it at the same time.

But doesn't each hop add a fee? So if I take your example, and hopped through 10 friends before getting to amazon, instead of paying through coinbase, I just paid the coinbase fee + 10 friend fees.
You're still ending up going through that trusted hub of coinbase, you're just going through 10 friends first. How does that help?
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:41:08
Hmmm, yes.
So if each node currently connects to 6 peers to upload. That would mean that if I broadcast from my 1st node:
1. My node broadcasts to first 6
2. Those 6 broadcast to a further 6 each
3. Those 36 nodes broadcast to a further 6 each
4. Those 216 broadcast to a further 6 each
5. and so on, so I need lets say 8 full broadcast hops from my first node to broadcast to a network of 1,000,000 nodes.
I'm not sure how long it takes to recieve and broadcast a tx. But I guess based on the above it appears sufficient.

It simply means focusing on the tech/idealism behind cryptography/cyphers and the general community attitudes that go along with it.
The thing is though most people in the bitcoin community don't abide by those ideals, or they claim to abide by them but act in the opposite/contradictory manner. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:13:19
I see, so there's a balancing act.
That's right, the miners use a pipeline or something named similar setup by a community member (from memory).

This is at best a mistake, otherwise this is a lie.
* For 1, it is entirely dependent on user download speed, and peer connection. How can you give a static timeframe when you don't know the variables?
* Average time for most people with average internet in the developed world is about 24-48 hours. Again, depending on the randomness of your peer connections. Sometimes it's good, sometimes not.
* Perhaps you're talking about your own experience only and you have particularly poor internet connection/location?
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:15:22
That would be a limitation of your peer connections, possibly based on your location and poor quality peers around you. You can play with the config of the client to try to connect to better clients / different clients for a much faster download.
The blockchain is currently 130GB (someone double check me), that means on a 100mbs connection it should be completed with good peering in 12 to 24 hours. Of course, with bad peering the time can grow very large. With perfect peering you could drop it down to about 3 hours for the entire blockchain to download on a 100 connection.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:01:37
That didn't respond to my concerns at all?
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:29:50
from what I understand it costs a standard transaction fee to open a lightning channel. Then a standard fee to close a channel.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:57:56
If I do a thought experiment, imagine everyone ran full nodes (so say, 1,000,000 full nodes), and there were only 1,000 miner nodes.
Wouldn't the large number of full nodes run by everyone slow the network down?
After all, my transaction needs to propagate through the network going from node to node until it reaches the only node that matters for this purpose, a miner node. 
If there's a delay from me sending a transaction, and a miner node receiving the transaction, that isn't good for network speed.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:14:53
I still don't understand this line of thinking because I don't see the motivation behind it. Even if we assume the worst, acting in such a way would still remain against their long term interests. So unless they're planning a quick exit (somehow), I remain pretty skeptical. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:47:51


That's due to peer connections and limitations of the peers you've connected with. Or you have terrible internet. I feel that often people really don't know what they're talking about and don't understand that the true bottleneck of running a node will always be the peer connection bandwidth.
If you're unhappy about long download times for the blockchain, you should want to reduce low bandwidth (low cost) nodes from the system. A network of high bandwidth nodes would mean you could download the entire current blockchain in about 2-4 hours on a regular 100 connection.

Are you just trying to stir up trouble?

@_date: 2017-08-22 06:55:51
With the debate surrounding block size and the effect it has on nodes. Would it be worthwhile reducing the default peer connections to reduce the bandwidth bottleneck that's the current limiting factor? It seems that even with reduced peers network propagation would be exceedingly fast.
Do reduced peer connections have any other effects? (by reduced peers I am talking about perhaps dropping from 8 to only 4)
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:17:34
So you're saying that as of today's prices, assuming you "immediately transferred" as you stated (at the initial price of somewhere between $250 - $380), you've managed to miss out on ~100% gains over a 26 day period?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:54:43
We can't just go back and forth calling each other wrong, but, well, that's wrong. The bottleneck is peer connections and bandwidth. The most common limiting factor for effective nodes today is upload data limits. CPUs are not a greater bottleneck. I can't imagine what hardware you're trying to run a node on where you think the CPU is a bigger bottleneck.
Average CPUs will handle 16MB blocks perfectly fine today, average user connections and peer distribution won't handle 16MB as well. Hence why I'm calling it a bottleneck.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:32:56


That assumes that all miners are in collusion. In a market, if one miner drops off and the hash rate drops, you would think that another miner would "fill the gap". Since it would be highly profitable to do so.
A miner dropping out would be gambling on the fact that no other miner would take his place. This seems highly unlikely and against their own interests.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:27:20
Other people seem to be making sense of them perfectly fine. Anyway, let me try again.
My concern is that monopolies will be created for certain node channel operators due to who they are connected to, and the ability to discriminate who connects.
If a business only wants to connect through a certain node channel, there's nothing to prevent that. This will create monopolistic scenarios as far as I can tell.

It relates to advocating strong cryptography, and an individuals rights around their own use of cryptography, and the privacy that comes with it. Individual right to privacy is big, individual control of your own life through cryptographic security, and promotion of the technology/use of the technology.
I guess the big three would be:
* Right to privacy/anonymity
* Security
* The tech, math, science, software, and hardware to achieve the above
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:54:52


That's not true. You need to fund your hub so that users can trasact through it. The single biggest cost isn't hardware, but funding your own hub with BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:12:57


This part confuses me a little, because whilst I understand that, isn't a critical factor the connections the node has?
i.e. If I want to pay, for example, amazon in the future, but amazon won't let just any old node connect, it has to be a trusted node. So the users who wish to pay amazon are pushed to a specific node or group of nodes. 
In other words, is lightning all about "who (the node) knows"? and if the node connections are critical, how can small upcoming node operators hope to provide a cheap alternative to the big established nodes?
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:18:27






I don't see how that addresses my point. That if I want to pay X business, and X business uses Y node. The newcomer node Z doesn't have a channel with X business. I have to use Y node. If Z node doesn't have a channel with who I want, how would they ever grow?
Could Y node restrict other nodes from connecting to it? So it retain a monopoly?

I'm quite certain that's not true, as I visit both subs and I simply have kept equal amounts of both, but more to the point, how could you possibly know what you're claiming? You're claiming that most people who subscribe to r/btc have sold their bitcoins? How could you possibly know this?

I think the general users (no matter where they fall - big block, small block, whatever) would love to see all of the figureheads toppled. There are far too many people with far too great an influence at the moment.

It's funny, because people like to trot out this opinion (the "haha paris is so dumb" opinion) because they like to put others down to raise themselves up a little. Hell, a lot of people truly believe it. But if you looked a little bit into her history you'd see she's made some pretty wise investment/business decisions, and she's a lot smarter behind closed doors than she shows in her public persona.
I don't know if it's ironic but it's definitely funny when people call someone stupid, but all they really do is show off their ignorance.
In the end I'd say she's made a fuckload more money than any of us ever will, and whilst the beginnings of that were due to the family wealth, she certainly hasn't sat on it. She's created her own wealth.
Might be worth listening to someone who's worth $100 million (or at least not being so dismissive).

Since nobody is using segwit (~1% usage as of last count), perhaps it would've been intelligent to go with 2MB blocks first!?

I can see you've never been involved in such a project. Civil Engineer here, and I can tell you a large part of the job is talking to stakeholders and "layman" and answering their questions, responding to comments and criticism, and sharing your expertise in simple language. If you can't explain why you're doing something the way you're doing it, you're not very good at your job.
In these kinds of projects you never give absolute free reign to the technical designers / specifiers, you always have multiple people with multiple interests involved. Generally you'd have representatives of certain groups to limit the amount of time you spend answering queries/questions, but it's still as I said a very big part of the process.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:57:09
You're putting words in my mouth.
I said it would've been intelligent to go with a 2MB block first. Then once the immediate issue of full blocks and high fees was dealth with, implement segwit. There's no need to increase block size further from that point.
If no progress is made on alternative scaling solutions, and we again reach the limit of capacity and fees increase massively again, only then we could consider a second block size increase.

Yes and no. The goal of segwit was to pave the way for layer 2 solutions and products. This is necessary, but is contentious on the way it's been implemented and the proposed future layer 2 solutions are still poorly defined and explained, and a lot of questions remain about the nature of them.
