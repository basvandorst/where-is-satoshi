Bitcoin cash is not the solution, it’s just another fork. Whoever controls the source code controls the currency. And that’s what bitcoin cash is all about, greed.

or for creating this mess.

oh yes let's blame the bankster mafia for infiltrating bitcoin.. 
talking about opening asses, tell me can you push a commit to bitcoin cash on github? if you can't it's not open source. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:32:39
Alright, thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:58:29
please if you don't know what you're talking about then don't open your ass. Bitcoin is on github, but not everyone can contribute to the source code. Bitcoin cash is a copy of the bitcoin source code with the 1mb transaction size limit increased to 2mb.

it doesn't matter, if Satoshi comes forth today he will be assassinated tomorrow.

when you submit an app through the app store you need to provide genuine information, like first name last name country etc. if any of those are invalid the app can be taken down. it wouldn't be hard for the court to get those details from Apple. in fact apple actively cooperates to catch frauds and criminals through their system. So in fact there is a great case to be made here and suing this guy is actually possible.

it's portrayed as if she was shedding skin - freeing herself from the oppression and a new pure version of her is underneath. She is also encouraging others to do the same by the flag she is holding and looking backwards.
However, she is still oppressed to some extent by that tank-top she's wearing. She should instead free herself by open bob.

bitcoin unfortunately will crash and burn, because it is no longer feasible to make a profit whilst mining.
