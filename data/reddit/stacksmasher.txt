Simple, I have $65,000 in cash and I don't want my wife to have it so I cant put it in a bank... that much cash is very hard to move or hide.... unless its in bitcoin form. (This is just an example, I love my wife) ; )

What if I spend all my BTC on TigerDirect? Because I never changed it to fiat do I still have the same issue?

If you are running a business start your own exchange!  What makes them so special? 
I could write and host a site like Bitstamp or BTC-e in less than a day or two. There is nothing special about any of it.

I would use it in a normal bar.... but what its ideal for would be a "Gentlemans" club.

Well since Its gone down so much in value I don't think its an issue anymore. Now if it goes back up to $1000... Ill have some issues.

No thanks, Mark is lucky he is still alive. I would not want to live with that kind of responsibility dealing with other peoples money. Lets face it, bitcoin is popular with hitmen, crooks, drug dealers for a reason. ; )
You think he can rip those people off and live to tell the tale?

Who the fuck leaves anything of value in an exchange? All these places can take all your shit and just close its doors. Just cash and transfer or buy and transfer.. Thats why I dont understand GOX, who the fuck would trust a fat little "magic the card game" admin?  
Are you people all fucked in the head?

Hey I have 20Mh/s and am a little disturbed at the low earnings lately. Whats your plan? I may just keep it on a multipool and let it grind away for a while.

Also ask anyone who has had their assets seized for any reason valid or not...

Im in the same boat... I may just keep it as a hedge for my retirement in case my 401k tanks.

How would anyone know if you didn't tell them?

Yea, you are right. Even if they are totally worthless when the next gen are finally released, Ill let them run just to support the network.

I just bought 2 off craigslist for $500... the kid had no idea wtf he was doing and they run @ about 8gh each... Ill mine with them for a few months and sell them on e-bay to another sucker. Remember... if the price of BC keeps going up the price per GH will go up also.

So how do you "SOLO" mine with these? I think you should be able to set BFGminer using the --http command and point it to your local client running in -server mode.
Does this sound right?
