I commented in a post to this article earlier, but...
tldr: To moon, what we need is more direct investment in the underlier and less in derivative instruments.
First things first, this is great news. All around positive for the progress and adoption of both physical and derivative instruments related to crypto.
And with that said, yes, we went live on futures on the CME and CBOE. Sweet. And yes, now GS is going to be offering products derived on the price of Bitcoin. The fact is this, both are derivatives built on the “price” of Bitcoin and do little to directly drive the price of any crypto asset up or down (half true as in given current state open interest is more easily manipulated with the relatively low volume).
For shit to hit the moon, what we need is both Institutional and Wealth businesses directly investing in the underlier. What’s an underlier? Bitcoin, ETH, ELA and NEO are all underliers (obvious shills)...the underlier is the actual coin. Futures and all these derivatives are not “actual” investments creating volume. It’s like the Big Short, a bet, on top of a bet, on top a bet... Not a perfect metaphor, but conceptually close.
You know what would be news, in my mind? An exchange traded fund (ETF) or Mutual Fund. That’s when we’re going to see shit hit the fan...market cap hitting the multi trillions.
And I eagerly await for that to happen with my previously shilled coins.
Champagne and caviar dreams to us all.
