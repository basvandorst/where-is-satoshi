Big if true.

Pretty sure you just install it and it'll run. When you input your currency, just make sure you get the date and vendor you bought your coin from correct so it can then scale it properly.

Ding ding ding ding. We have a winner.

11 days... Nope.

Accusations are flying around that there was insider knowledge regarding one of the biggest crypto currency exchanges "Coinbase" deciding to list b.cash (not to be confused with actual Bitcoin). This lead to Bitcoin itself tanking and bcash rising to an all time high due to a far easier accessibility by newcomers or the general public.
A lot of people are upset that they're losing money from their Bitcoin because they're either new to the crypto scene and haven't experienced the very very volatile nature of it, they bought at an all time high and/or they've placed way to much of their net worth into crypto (only ever buy crypto with money that you won't miss if you lose it). 
So to start your crypto journey (assuming you haven't invested yet), put $20 aside from your pay and buy whatever coin you want. Watch them go up and down, research each coin you're interested in - developers Twitter accounts tend to give the best info believe it or not.

Blockfolio is best bet. Amazing app.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:05:41
MyEtherWallet (MEW).
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:19:04
That logic applies to Bitcoin itself too.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:44:35
This tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:11:01
Agree. I dumped 50% of my btc into it. I just have a feeling...
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:44:46
I thought that they were listing it as B2X? Pretty sure I read somewhere that it'll stay B2X unless it dominates BTC (old).
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:44:27
They don't make it easy, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:38:22
I have a Nano S and they're great. Makes the whole process easy and you've got your BTC and altcoins all in "one place".
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:02:42
Binance. I'd recommend them, nice charts and every alt you can think of. Decent app too!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:40:04
They're the cheapest place for me to convert to alts so I still use them, but their UI isn't the friendliest for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:29:42
Surely you only lost a couple of hundred dollars immediately?

That you can buy a Lambo that will reach Saturn.

Why buy any car that isn't a McLaren?

This son. Diversify your portfolio and make incremental withdrawals into fiat when you profit.

Depends on what the price of BCH is when that happens. If they are similarly priced, BCH most likely has the upper hand as even with the difficulty adjustment it will be more profitable to mine BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:48:26
So BCH eventually kills BTC in the end?
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:25:51
Mine dogecoin and sell for more dogecoin, you'll be landing on the moon in no time.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:32:18
You're right. Im going to invest my house in dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:29:45
The problem is at this point you're not going to see a huge return for a while (I.e. x 4 input). If you want that $50 to turn into $100 overnight, you may as well bet on a football game. I mean, realistically BTC is about as risky in the sense that tomorrow it could stall or drop. 
To be honest mate, I'd invest in another crypto with $50.
