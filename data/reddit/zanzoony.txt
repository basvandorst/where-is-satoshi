What about this organisation? The Palestinian Animal League. They are an organisation in Palestine that promotes animal rights, funds medical bills for animals and teaches people about the importance of animal welfare. Their motto is Justice For All. They have also opened the first vegan cafeteria in Palestine and promote a vegan diet for both animal rights and the environment.

I agree with you - to a point. Ultimately though anyone who's done a basic amount of research on cryptos should know what an ICO is. To give your opinion on something you clearly have done very limited research on only serves to undermine your argument. I consider myself still very much a newbie but I wonder if I might even know more about crypto than Shiller. Yes, looking to historical events to predict the future or make sense of the present is helpful (and necessary sometimes) but where we're dealing with technology that is completely new then a lot of the times it's the older generations who fall behind in the knowledge department.

Yep, heard them all. I don't mind having those conversations though because it makes me think 'hey, maybe I'm not too late to the game after all!'.

Easier said than done. Price bottoms tend to be identified in hindsight!
What are the other reasons you think XBT will sink (other than the hard fork threat)?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:47:09
Good point

Possibly - yet even with the current correction (which seems to have been driven by a large sell that moved the market coupled with weak hands being swayed by the China stories) I don't see the price going much lower than $4000...

This might seem like a real noob question but are you saying wait until the later 'sell the news' drop before buying? i.e. not to buy before the later 'sell the news' drop?

Thanks for your reply. 
Agreed re recent fork. However, the upcoming fork looks different to me as doesn't no replay protection mean it in effect won't be a clean chainsplit? That's a major concern! 
EDIT: feel free to correct me if I'm missing something.

Hmmm... I see a left shoulder and a head... Going up again so possible the 2nd shoulder is being created? Not sure if it's safe to go to bed...
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:44:10
I completely agree.

So, just to be clear I understand your point, you're saying that even if Bitcoin is in a bubble right now and will at some point crash, it will ultimately rise again?

I didn't even know he did a podcast on crypto. Just looked it up - it was back in early June. So I guess that's one of the ways more people learned about it... I was speaking to someone close to me who lives in SF the other day and was saying I was pretty busy with crypto lately - they'd never heard of it!

Thanks for the tip, looks like the price is staying pretty steady for now.

I just read this. Drips with sarcasm! What are your thoughts on it?

I've been buying 0.1 XBT at stages throughout the last few days of this bear run and have gotten some good prices. I want to buy 0.5 XBT more but can't decide whether to do so tonight or take the risk that the market might dip further tomorrow (Monday)... or not.
Thoughts on how the markets will swing on Monday?
