I find most personal brands of crypto businesses very self-serving in the narratives they foster. But it does make an interesting use-case for stable coins. Blockchain at the intersection of government is something Canada is really leading in.

Bitcoin is having an interesting year in 2018, with some surprises.

With Bakkt, now anything is possible for BTC.

Why is Bitcoin so controversial as it appears in America's Media?

It's not even about the HODL types, it's about this:

Is Jack Dorsey and Square Cash app the new vanguard of Bitcoin adoption? It's looking that way in 2019.

Is Bitcoin the best meme ever created?

As blockchain adoption continues to increase, the impact on crypto and an emerging token economy is sort of inevitable.

Bitcoin owns nearly half of the cryptocurrency market cap, but I wonder for how much longer things can stay that way? At a certain point the better dApp platforms will increase in price relative to Bitcoin, I suspect this will start in 2019 and show serious changes in 2020.

Wow this is super interesting, thanks!

How do you get more mainstream adoption when the Whales own so much of it already though? It seems public blockchains are getting more adoptions than alt currencies aren't they?
I'm not even sure what "public adoption" means at this point...?

Same price as November, 2017 basically. However dApp platforms show a lot more promise than digital currencies don't they? If Bitcoin is a symbol, smart contracts are entire ecosystems and communities where actual products are manifesting.

Nobody uses or cares about crypto as replacing fiat, Bitcoin is little more than a digital gold at this point? But in the actual adoption of public blockchains, real innovation is occurring that is starting to intersect with Enterprise, Cloud and the future of technology in the real world.

Can someone address the issue of whales dominating Bitcoin?
The Problem with Bitcoin?
Whales are playing games with our minds and our wallets.

Someone should pay Trump in crypto to create Chaos. 
Russia is probably already doing that though...

Why is Bitcoin rising and is it sustainable?

Is it altcoin season? Is this the end of the crypto winter in view?

 Wasn't inevitable though that crypto would be hijacked by Silicon Valley and such? STOs instead of ICOs. "Digital assets" instead of altcoins and cryptocurrencies. All in the name of profit! Without decentralized principles.
