Frabicelli retracements indicate a 25.5% support level on the extraction sequence. Strong support ceilings are at the 75000 line. Further observations indicate a 2-120% Canelloni retraction on the Pineapple express.

Here in Holland, they see it as an investment rather than savings. I have a book keeper that takes care of my shit so I don't know the details, but I believe I start paying capital gains when I convert bitcoin to fiat. But since someone takes care of my books I don't know for sure, maybe someone else here can enlighten you more.

Let's hope you can do the down payment in bitcoin by then!

Try Dayma as a last name, Damya isn't a very common name in india, Dayma sounds more likely
