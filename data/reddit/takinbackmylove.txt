they charge users for depositing fees into their wallet, it's absurd, never knew it'll cost something to receive bitcoin

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:42:54
Just tell them not enough 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:27:39
could it be because Bitflyer is coming into US and they have segwit? thus it's cheaper to send from Bitflyer compared to Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:51:12
any links that might explains these points in technical way? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:02:27
bitcoin will survive doomsday, it is decentralize, you will need to wipe out every single full nodes to fully wipe bitcoin

I don't get it, it shows 50k plus on coinbase, what does it has to do with a million down payment and 250k house? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:34:43

Probably when Satoshi sell all his 1 million btc at cheap price, but then, I'm pretty sure lines of millionaires are waiting to buy them all 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:53:57

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:05:03
What? By removing the difficulty adjustment designed by Satoshi and calling it Satoshi's vision? Give me a break 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:17:35
Suck this bch supporters 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:15:15

So if someone made a Facebook clone, the current Facebook we know now should be called Facebook Core? What a fucking retard

Look Ma, an idiot in the internet 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:43:45
you sir is my champion 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:42:46
I think you are not qualified to use the internet, Bithumb was offline hours ago and now it's back up, yesterday it has more than 45% of the BCH/KRW volume

Isn't the government banned Bitcoin in Indonesia few months ago? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:52:19
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:26:01
haha, big joke, malaysia government are known for not fulfilling it's promises, and last minute change of mind culture, besides, general election is coming in a few more months, they are doing everything they can to please people 
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:11:19
but in Vietnam, there is not enough computers or infrastructure for me to spend bitcoin, wait, there isn't too anywhere else in the world :(

If she's a big fat chick, will you still help? Or would we all still know this initiative? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:13:33
wait a minute, I am already using a segwit wallet, if they don't stop doing that, that means I might not be getting 100% of the benefits such as low fee, fast transaction or etc from segwit wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:37:09
If she ain't pretty, no one will give a duck 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:08:05
help me to understand this, sometimes the fees are really expensive due a pilling amount of transactions in mempool, but that is due to the block is full right? and I thought with segwit, it has been increased to 2mb? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:46:40
Well, they're called Goldman Sachs for a reason, not Bitcoin  Sachs 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:10:49
is it fair to be called dividend? all these old schools writer need to study about crypto before start writing 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:09:28
Sorry, what I meant was why averages size are less than 1mb if the max size is 2mb/4mb? if that's so, why are fees still expensive sometimes? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:28:38
I did the same as well 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:52:53
localbitcoin is your answer
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:22:07
when you say 100 people competing for 50 seats, does it mean that technically there is not enough mining hashrate in bitcoin? as far as I know difficulty climbs up higher and higher, which might suggest more and more miners are coming in 
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:00:36
fuck, you should not set your pin code this way
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:01:15
then what's the point of running one 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:18
I am not sure why, I thought 6 confirmations should be the safest? or should I just ignore this since no major miners will go rogue and change something to the transaction? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:12:26
Same shit happened to me, then I learnt how to order as well, since then, 0% maker fees, cost nothing to buy or sell btc at all 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:58
never mind about the post, found an awesome article that explains lightning, 
anyone have any idea when lightning will be implemented in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:28:18
less than 2000$ now 
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:59:58
So all BTC exchange are eventually digital banks? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:17:47
dont get me wrong, it dropped 16% of the total value of Bitcoin within 2 hours, this has never ever happened before right? 
@_date: 2017-07-09 08:53:32
print out the paper wallet by yourself and use it 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:51:35
Ffs, just use Wirex card 
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:38:40
why don't you just forget that you bought BTC and carry on with your life. Come back again after a few months/half a year and so
