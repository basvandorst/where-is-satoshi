A question about the coloured tokens - can they be stored in a normal bitcoin address/wallet? Can I store them on a Trezor? 
(and a related question - is Mycelium integrated with Trezor?)
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:22:31
just send to an electrum wallet - or buy a Trezor and send to that
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:59:03
You are not wrong - I wish I had it here where I live. If they integrate it globally they are heading towards the "killer app"

You need to know that Coins.ph is a simply a great service.  I use it regularly.  I don't live in the Philippines and am not Filipino but I have family and business there.
To cash out to a local - just send your BTC to your "peso" wallet.  Then set up a cash out via bank or one of the thousands of other agents (which are even in the smallest of places) or the rest of the options:
 
Cardless ATM Instant Payout (24/7) 
Coins.ph 24/7 eGiveCash
BDO, BPI, etc. 
Cash Pickup
Palawan Express Pera Padala, Cebuana Lhuillier Pera Padala, etc.
Cash Card
Smart Money Card, RCBC MyWallet , etc.
Mobile money
Globe GCash
Door-to-Door Delivery
2GO Quikcash, LBC Pesopak, etc.
Stored-Value Card
 
I always use Lhuiller - because they are everywhere. 
The support offered by Coins.ph deserves the GOLD award.
Without hesitation I recommend their services - and they don't pay me.   I pay them.
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:04:54
No - everybody uses Coins.ph

Do a citizens arrest on the machine. Obviously stole your money. Open shut case.
Take it home - crack it open - retrieve your property - return machine and leave complaint note on it with a bill for your labours.
@_date: 2015-12-23 05:17:12
I looked at Rebit - Coins.ph is much better - so much more options and fees are low if not zero in some cases. Used it again today.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:35:02
Trezor does everything you need at less than half the Keepkey price.
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:44:50
I did not know that - who are they?
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:50:22
"The challenges for blockchain and bitcoin in the year ahead will be two-fold.  
1 - Proponents will have to further address the lack of trust, a challenge the have  faced since their creation.  
2 - Then, the challenge of turning these technologies to tackle more real-world scenarios, such as sending money overseas"
nothing left to do then for a whole year if these are the challenges to solve............
Did Visa actually pay someone to write such poorly researched material and then publish it without checking anything?
@_date: 2015-12-15 09:37:51
its actually 12% of BTC mined per week approx
seems too much?
signif IMO
@_date: 2015-12-01 05:23:50
Now if they could add a static deposit ref number (currently you need a new one for every deposit and they only last for 4 hrs) to allow Peso deposits to be automated for weekly deposits or a static deposit account that you can tell people to pay into - they would become a bank in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-12-21 10:15:27
get skilled
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:22:35
Would not work - any reasonably savvy robber would track the transaction on the blockchain and realise they did not receive the proceeds of your kind deposit. Pretty basic stuff.
@_date: 2016-06-19 06:19:34
Bitcoin is a lumbering giant which can't seem to make any decisions even when its crucial - like blocksize.
You are about to witness a more nimble coin show Bitcoin what its missing.
And dont forget - BTC has hard forked and rolled back too. Check your history.
(disclosure - I own both BTC and ETH) so I am not just an ETH evangilist.

Great work Paxful
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:40:29
Truely a great moment - History in the making.  All credit to Slush for having the balls to make a decision.
Bring it on.
come mine at SLUSH
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:56:47
bollocks - they have a vested interest to reject.  Do your research.
Besides - only sheep mine at F2Pool.
Yes there are a lot of sheep.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:01:57
seriously - you think people would use this?
Demo vids are atrocious.
Trezor is the best solution - you have lost the plot
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:55:08
How to mine on XT via SLUSH Singapore?
whats the URL for us Australasian folk
you only show
@_date: 2015-08-31 10:00:30
yep thats why I mine too
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:48:34
While the technology is noteworthy with power saving and hash increase - how could it be attractive at this price?
Not allowing for power costs and difficulty increase the simple ROI is 185 days or just over 6 months.
With power costs and difficulty factored its probably over a 9 month ROI - so 9 months before you have ANY profit?
Why would anyone buy?  To stay in the arms race?
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:34:04
Peter has lost the plot if he thinks everyone will be happy to pay $20 per transaction when sending BTC?? Are you for real?
Even the banks are cheaper than that.
That would kill BTC faster than slower propagation in a few parts of the world.
Its just not for the best interests of the users at all.
My vote is still firmly for XT and all my hash is at SLUSH - but if other devs come up with something better and realistic in the meantime before Jan next year the miners can vote with hash for that. Like many I am open to the best "available" solution - but if nothing else eventuates we already have a solution in place.
I would prefer if Peter and his followers put their heads down and came up with a viable alternative - and kept their mouths shut until they do.
This argument is not helping BTC at all.  
Its starting to remind me of a troup of monkeys trying to open a cookie jar. It always starts out nice but quickly subsides to aggression.  They all want to "own" the cookie jar but its useless since they have no solution to open it. Then one pragmatic monkey comes along, smashes the jar and shares the cookies. Albeit with a few glass splinters detracting slightly from the solution.
Now until some smarter monkey comes along and works out how to get the lid off - all the monkeys will be smashing their jars because it fecking works just fine.
Peter is trying to get the lid off - Gavin has smashed the jar.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:03:21
Thanks - I will swap hash to SG XT server tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-08-22 07:51:56
There never will be a BTC LN
It will be another coin at that stage (Bipple?) - and Ripple and the other centralised coins? (whatever they think they are) would be better anyhow (but who wants them anyhow)!
XT - bring it on
@_date: 2015-08-27 02:43:07
and it works just great - the service and support of SLUSH is No.1
@_date: 2015-08-31 09:57:10
yes - you are correct in terms of an appreciating asset but a miner is depreciating at at least 100% per 12 months - so in 9-12 months the equipment is worth practically zero so you might get 3 months actually earning before you are losing money. Three months @ SFA because the difficulty has spiked means you might get back 1-3 BTC - well hell - maybe worthwhile if price increases.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:03:04

@_date: 2015-08-08 04:00:31
There is no risk that I can see.  Seed could restore wallet to Trezor 2.0. 
If Trezor lost data/destroyed - then restore to a new Trezor with seed.
If Trezor goes out of business - restore wallet via seed to Electrum or other compatible HD (Hieracrical Deterministic) wallets.
Your critical risk is losing your seed - or PIN/ and especially a passphrase (if you chose to apply a passphrase).
Lose your seed you cannot restore. If you lose your seed and still have access to the Trezor you can reset the seed (Send coins to another wallet, reset/wipe Trezor, set up a new Trezor with a new seed, transfer coins back into the new Trezor wallet).
Lose your PIN - you can still restore to a new Trezor.
If you chose to have a passphrase - and you lose or forget it - You have lost your coins - REALLY LOST THEM.
If the parameters involved in generating HD wallets changed - then we would have an issue for all HD wallets.  This would be huge and a work around to restore old wallets to new format wallets would be released probably well before any change.
Thats my understanding

This post is just pulling paranoia strings and the Nirvana fallacy again - if its not perfect then something which does not exist may be better?  FFS
Everything there is included for valid reasons - best read all available info again. I have and am Ok with all.  Decide for yourself.
Peter has lost the plot if he thinks everyone will be happy to pay $20 per transaction when sending BTC?? Are you for real?
Even the banks are cheaper than that.
That would kill BTC faster than slower propagation in a few parts of the world and some better ddos protection.

They will best be advised to use Ethereum
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:14:57
I really don't get your point? Try and simplify it it for most who are not BTC devs.
XT has made it scalable - many of the core devs are still thinking how to achieve this? They are screwing around with the public/community with the Nirvana fallacy. I.E if its not perfect its not right but they can't provide something even close to workable - but they hold the intangible up as the "solution".
My vote and MOST votes are for XT. Come up with something realistic - then come back please.  Maybe then the community will listen.
Stop the division - and screw sidechains and screw Blockstreams aspirations at the expense of BTC.
Bring it on XT
Mine at SLUSH and make it happen.
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:51:11
a lot more under its belt for this particular application - spelt "Ethereum"

@_date: 2015-08-31 10:04:00
but what do we do when our s3's are up against this S7 - you and I are gonna be fecked!
This S7 is serious - its a paradigm shift in terms of mining. If you don't own it you will be losing money hand over fist to stay in the game - even with S5 or S5+
But SLUSH is killing it - mine XT on SLUSH
XT is not the question - its the answer

Thanks for your answer - yes my S3's will hash until they blow (which seems incredibly hard to achieve even overclocked to 243 Freq. which is 100% stable for most of them).  
But what do I buy then? I suppose it will be second hand S7's?
@_date: 2015-09-30 09:28:28
Why? if you already got BTC - you just send that - and convert to cash for a remittance (rebit) to your recipient.  If you got DOGE convert to BTC via ShapShift and convert to cash via Rebit.ph
I take it that this service is to help those that dont have BTC but have other cryptos and they want to remit to friends and family in the Philippines.
Great idea!

Is KeepKey compatible with Trezor?
KeepKey is actually a fork of the Trezor project. We have maintained compatibility through development, and are compatible with Trezor v1.3.3. We have kept certain features of Trezor for which KeepKey has implemented differently (for example device recovery). We intend to sunset these Trezor specific features in the near future, as well as bring an array of new KeepKey features. Therefore, expect to see compatibility dissipate over time.
This tells me they have taken what they need to get started for free but won't share everything in the future.
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:55:24
Be aware that they leeched Trezor open source code at no cost and put a bigger screen on the device and charge x2.4 price of Trezor.
All credit to Trezor and shame on you Keep Key.
Make something new and innovative yourself please and then I might look at it.
@_date: 2015-09-30 07:38:07

No worries Ron - you got a good service.
But you need to fix weekend transfers.  Every now and then when its an emergency waiting a couple of days is a real issue.  Found out the hard way.
This is Bitcoin - we expect instant  - better than Western Union.
The evolution of Philippines Bitcoin must migrate with time to trusted/company verified street agents and bypass the Lhuillier's etc to:
1- Speed transactions
2 - Avoid Corporate fee structures
If you and Rebit don't do it - I will!
Constructive advice that will help hopefully.

hey Vape - don't smoke
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:19:50
You are 100% correct that the Philippines is the perfect partner for Bitcoin. I am not Filipino but spend a lot of time there and use Coins.ph to send funds to family there.
When you see just how many smart phones and so few bank accounts - its a no brainer. Small businesses can really make use of this - tap into the US/Euro tourists. Remittances is the big one though - HUGE. When I live there I may just be part of your competition - but best to work together in the end.
Beats Western Union who screwed me around for years.
All the very best for your business - almost chose to go with your services but just joined coins.ph first and have been totally satisfied. Perhaps I try your services out sometime.
and as for vaping - you live in utopia
check these guys - some of the best product globally (but buy juice from HaloCigs (VERY PURE and HEALTHY)
Maraming salamat
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:39:37
A question - suppose I send bitcoin to Rebit on the weekend for cash pickup via Cebuana Lhuillier - whats the time delay till pickup is available by the recipient? Same day - or Mon?
Coins.ph don't seem to do anything on the weekends which is their one main fail.
@_date: 2016-10-24 08:48:47
but no S9's for sale - so whats the point?
@_date: 2015-11-18 03:40:51
The Reserve Bank considers that banks’ obligations under the AML/CFT Act require measured risk management and do not justify blanket de-risking. With appropriate systems and controls in place, banks should be able to manage and mitigate the money laundering and terrorism financing risks posed by many money remitters. If banks are de-risking to avoid rather than manage and mitigate those risks, then that would be inconsistent with the intended effect of the AML/CFT Act. It seems unlikely, but if banks are using blanket de-risking itself as a procedure to manage and mitigate those risks, then the Reserve Bank would consider that an inadequate means of complying with their obligations under the AML/CFT Act.

Does this mean that Trezor wont work with Electrum in Windows?
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:06:02
and the LTC Electrum works with Trezor - but BTC does not?  I thought it was just me - for months too...........
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:04:32
Hey thanks for your advice on this.
If all this is correct then Electrum just lost the plot.
Who on earth is going to go through all this to use Trezor with Electrum? Bitcoin is hard enough without this.
I suppose that Trezor still states that Electrum is compatible?  Just checked. 
yes they do.
Electrum Devs - can you please fix this up sometime.
@_date: 2015-11-26 08:48:34
and now all that Trezor/Ethereum need to do is get together and integrate ETH into Trezor
Trezor is the only solution. Its just great.
