Good luck to anyone that's trying to bruteforce this.
There's 116 BIP39 words in this image. If the seed has 24 non repeatable words, this will give you: 116!/(116-24)! combinations. That's just 2727927105132654282924644622427678734286848000000 combinations.
Even if you check 1 billion of them per day, it would take you 7473772890774395295683957869664873244 years. 
The Universe will be dead by then.
