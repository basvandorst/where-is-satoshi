What you mean to say, is that its highly beneficial to early adopters.  It's still got that 'monopoly money' feel to the vast majority of the public, but a lot of people are benefitting from its use already.

This seems like it would be completely useless against MNC.
They only release 2 coins a block, and reset difficulty very quickly.

Second thought, this does absolutely nothing bad for any one.  This is good.  It doesn't increase the rate at which they go out, it just influences BTC : [other crypto] ratio.  Who cares?

Aren't all the non BTC cryptos completely dependent on the price of BTC?  So if they go up, its not so much a threat, just an indication of BTC's health?
This isn't about BTC vs. other cryptos.  This is about Traders vs. Miners.  And thats really, really, really stupid.

This seems like a good summarization of why it's a bad plan.  Besides, aren't all the alts basically completely tied to BTC in value?  They all are based on how they transfer through BTC.
This seems more like traders being upset over miners.  What they don't seem to understand is that traders have nothing if this doesn't become super widely accepted, and trying to stifle mining just hurts you.  Cut off your nose to spite your face, right?

Maybe he has a bunch of BTC, and he's using that to trade for all the alt people are mining, while taking a little fee off the top too to make it more profitable?

Traders are bad.  Barter is good.

You'll get some crypto, that is what will happen, lol.

When I say bad, I mean it won't have the desired outcome the op is getting to. It might be profitable for people doing it though, not sure.
I wonder if the owner of the pool is a BTC person trying to get ALL THE CRYPTO! lol
