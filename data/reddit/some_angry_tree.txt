Lightning isn't like an update that can be done overnight or at the flick of a switch. Imagine the bitcoin miner network. A network of miners have to come up to have the blockchain exist and accept transactions.
In Lightning, even if the code is ready, the nodes (Like miners) still have to come up for it to accept Lightning Transactions.

It's not fine to risk $30 of BTC when there's a limited supply.

Scalability. Cash wanted to increase block sizes. Which is a band-aid fix that will grow the blockchain substantially. It's a linear fix for an exponential problem. Bigger blockchain means less full nodes. Less full nodes means less decentralization.

Yes, the Lightning fee is not the same as a miner/mempool fee.  
On the blockchain, the fee is paid to miners to prioritize what transactions are placed in the next block.  
On Lightning, fees are paid to use channels.  
Miner fees are users competing to get into the next block, while Channel fees are nodes competing to get users to go through their channel. It makes channel competition a push to be low fee to get more TX as opposed to the on-chain system that pushes for higher fees to get TXs settled.
I'm guessing you mean having to own a full copy of the network like a full blockchain node?  
A full blockchain node is not required to be functional. The wallets should have a built in node software that handles this.  
AFAIK there is no direct benefit to being a full lightning node. 
The Lightning Network keeps everything decentralized in a way where the 3rd parties you pay a fee to is the entire network, rather than an institution of sorts like a bank. Sort of like paying your taxes, and the taxes actually go directly into the service you're using.  
Sorry my knowledge on nodes are somewhat limited. Have yet to read up enough on it as much of Lightning is still in development and I'm currently waiting for it to be considered "Safe" before I look into running my own nodes.

Tx fee too low. Stuck in mempool until a miner picks it up or it gets dropped after a certain amount of time. You can respend it if it drops out of mempool.

GPUs cant compete anymore for btc mining. Maybe some alts would still be viable.

Can you shill any harder? "My transfers were fast and cheap" it doesn't matter what exchange you're on, if you're moving a hot crypto like BTC it'll take hours.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:34:38
Taxes are kind of required in society....

Exchange it for an alt like Ethereum and withdraw it into Gemini deposit. Using the alt would cost you that alt's tx fees instead of BTC's insane fee.

Off chain means the transactions are decided without being recorded on the block chain. Lightning is an off-chain solution to scalability where only the final balance of the funds of a channel are recorded on the chain, while every transaction that happened while the channel is up is decided by the 2 parties and protected by encryption. The part that allows you to trade to an infrequent individual is done by being a network of channels that routes funds through different channels until it reaches said individual.

its sad that our youth is more connected to current gen tech?

It does get more technical, and I am not a LN Dev so take what I say with a grain of salt and a form of summarization/simplification.  
The idea is to keep the channel open for long periods of time for the network to utilize and skim fees off those using your channel. The amount of transactions needed to break even for a person opening is 2 or 3 transactions depending on lightning fees.  
The amount of TX fees paid by user A do not scale with how many people are on the network. Everyone puts up their 2 TX to open a channel with eachother to make the network, then when the channel closes, 2 TX are made from the money in the channel to distribute to the 2 parties that opened said channel.

All transactions must be recorded in someway on the blockchain.  
Think of Lightning as a network of hot wallets. The part that deals with the block-chain is the channels.  
A and B throw money into a pot (they open a channel) and do business and decide who gets how much from the pot.  
A total of 4 TX is done per channel. 2 transactions are done, 1 each person, to send money into the pot or channel. 2 more transactions are done when the channel closes and the money is given back to A and B. Miners get this portion of the fees as normal, as its still 4 transactions on the blockchain.  
Sharing a pot or channel allows for the 2 people to trade between each other as much times as they want with the money they put into the pot without it being settled on-chain until it closes. A can send money to B multiple times and vice versa. It only counts as the 4 transactions to make and settle the channel instead of having to put every single transaction onto the blockchain. Currently, reading the blockchain will show every transaction ever. With Lightning transactions, we will only see who gets how much from a channel settling, but not every single transaction that happened on the channel.   
The Network part of Lightning Network connects these channels so that if A and C have a channel with B, but A and C do not have a channel with each other, then A and C can trade with each other by using their connections with B instead of having to open another channel. The Lightning Network fees, if any, go to B for being the middleman in A-C transactions.  
Everything will be encrypted to prevent bad actors.  A bad actor can still spam the mempool, but users being forced onto a channel is not a problem. The problem with mempool spamming is that they must pay fees. Which means they will burn a lot of money for very little if any damage. Ideally, most users will be using the Channel System, or Lightning Network, as it will allow almost infinite transactions to be done without being settled on-chain, but still being secured by decentralized encryption. They only touch directly on-chain if they move in and out of cold storage.

How about hoarding and a hard cap supply? BTC is a deflationary crypto. The limited supply means at some point, there wont be enough BTC to go around. How is this beneficial?  
This issue becomes worse when some BTC leaves circulation for various reasons such as deaths, poor private key management, hodlers, or even buggy code. Many reckless users trying to push Lightning onto Main-net right now. Imagine if a major Lightning flaw surfaces on the mainnet that wipes a fraction of the circulating currency.  
While the hard cap won't be reached for quite some time, the amount circulating will reach its cap before the hard cap.

How much is substantial? Like $50?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:42:52
Why would the miners process the transactions when new btc becomes scarce/nonexistant if there are no fees to rake in?
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:05:44
Perfectly normal. All exchanges swamped and takes forever to verify.

how's it a bcash shill when bcash is a crypto too, and he's not promoting any other coin? Everything he's said applies to bcash

I never understood whats wrong with being off chain, if its encrypted like the on chain. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:03:33
Bitcoin, its one of the most accepted crypto, but only if its traded on the Lightning Network. LN is designed for small transactions. Trading directly on the blockchain has too much fees right now.
