Yeah, electrum wouldn't work. I expected it to work, but wanted to be one of the first few to send bitcoin somewhere on an aircraft, as I'm betting the amount of people who have done that isn't high.i love it, a currency without borders.
A previous poster jumped my brain mentioning that electrum etc may not work due to use of non standard posts.

I am not kidding. It was similar when I launched the Bullshit Coin in 2016, people kept wanting it on an exchange so they could try and flip some of a worthless token for a profit.
You keep your BTC, at least it keeps the toilet bowl clean and keeps your money in your pocket.
Update: Some crypto news place copied my ANN post on the bitcointalk alts section:

My parody site as I got tired of all the scam ico and wanted something that was honest that shows all the scam ico and other scam investments that tarnish bitcoin as worse than shit. See  to see what I mean. I often comment the site address on any scam ico or investment I can find just to piss scammers off and have some fun parodying the fact they exist. Cause it is the equivalent of flushing your bitcoin down the bog when you invest in those scams.

It is completely honest in what it is :) I grow tired of all these scam 'investment' offerings that have given Bitcoin a bad name, so I felt it would be funny to parody it. I actually had an email from a guy asking me why I have not shared my 'ICO' with ICO places... It isn't a bloody ICO!
Unlike many of these investments which are nothing more than total dogshit, I offer a real outlet with which to flush your BTC down the bog, if one is that way inclined. Less painful, cause you to know what you are getting. Though if someone does take a large dump there, I will keep my word and send them a piece of memorabilia. Of course, no one with any brains is going to flush BTC down the bog in large amounts, but that's the fun part. I already had around 27.5 mBTC flushed down the bog by some stranger...
More fun is if people want to burn shitcoins like BCH.

I tried to set up a UK website where I would sell groceries that were non perishable to be sent around the world and you could spend cryptocurrency to do it.

Coinbase. If they ban you, you are screwed and entirely at their mercy, I know a couple of people in such a boat. I had one of those coinbase multisig vaults back in the day and I lost access to my 2FA key. I had tried many times a couple of years back to regain access to that account with no luck by contacting them with my ID and kept getting passed from pillar to post and had it 'escalated' many times. In the end, I used the printed out user key and shared key with my passphrase to move the coins myself at the time.
They no longer do those vaults where you 'control' the keys.
I still do not have access to that coinbase account.

the problem is, and I LOVE Bitcoin myself, bitcoin got into the public eye well and truly in 2017 first. All the public saw were high fee transactions, a slow network, then a price crash. Now all I hear average joes saying to me 'hahaha did you hear Bitcoin split into Bitcoin cash and this new fork? its not stable.' and then 'did you hear about all these bitcoin hacks?' The chance was blown, for a while at least. Once something has been tarnished like that, public trust is hard to get back, especially when many live just above or below the breadline in most of the world.
In the Philippines, they were warned not to invest in Bitcoin in the press due to price volatility. I don't want to buy a coffee for $3 to find i just lost $10, for instance.
I have a small holding of BTC, i am looking in the long term, as is my uncle. I am bearish short-term, but bullish long term. The days of instant gratification with it have gone.
I for one, cannot wait to see the nails in PayPal's coffin, after they crippled my small business with an account suspension and then started holding inbound transactions. I want to personally pass out the nails when PayPal falls to digital currencies ;) Permissionless cash is what we need.

I sold to pay living costs when I lost my job in 2017 sold 5.9 out of six coins at £800 a coin. Had bought in at £150. Painful but still had good profit compared to my initial investment. Still walked away from the peak with some profit though as I still had 0.1 BTC left in another wallet when it hit the peak.
Wouldn't have sold if I did not have to.

Lets blame the victim cause it makes us feel better about ourselves, that's ridiculous. He had done small jobs for him, gotten paid, had a contract, so would have eased his mind. I got conned by someone who showed me proper ID, contracts, etc but luckily only lost very little as tarot cards warned me he was a scammer when I checked, which I was surprised. I always do regular milestones in writing projects now, protects me.
You say it's his fault is like saying it's a victims fault they got raped or punched or beaten. He is in Asia where $5000 USD could change his life, big time. It is the scammer who hurt him, not himself! If it was his fault, he would have burned his money wilfully with intent or had been greedy, this did not happen. He worked his ass off.
I think rather than blaming victims as many on the crypto subs seem to do, moral support would be nice. I Have helped publish this scammers details because I want to do something good. I see he has taken down the site. It is this kind of attitude in the crypto community that has repelled most of my friends from crypto and the community like repelling magnets!
Maybe you should consider contacting the UK press, such as The Guardian, The Independant, The BBC, The Daily Mail &lt;- the last one is garbage, but email them all. Submit all your proof, details, and everything including their real names, and you may find the press runs a nice story on them!

If you made the app, publish the code for all to see. Maybe a good hacker may find a good 'exploit' in it.
You can report the domain to ICANN for false details in the WHOIS [
"The Registered Name Holder must provide "accurate and reliable contact details" *and* must "promptly correct and update them" during the registration term. The details required are stated in Section 3.7.7.1.: "the full name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and fax number if available of the Registered Name Holder; name of authorized person for contact purposes in the case of an Registered Name Holder that is an organization, association, or corporation; and the data elements listed in Subsections 3.3.1.2, 3.3.1.7 and 3.3.1.8."
* If a Registered Name Holder intentionally provides inaccurate or unreliable information, intentionally fails to promptly update the information, or fails to respond over fifteen (15) days to Registrar inquiries about the accuracy of the contact details, the Registered Name Holder will be in material breach of the agreement and the registration may be cancelled."
Accepting paypal in the crypto sphere is a very big problem. I am sorry to hear of this. I have been stiffed doing freelance work as well, though for a much lower amount as I accepted no less than milestone pay.
If the app is on any marketplaces, report it for copyright fraud as you still own the copyright as he has not paid for it.
If he hasn't taken the site down, see if it is there on the wayback machine if his site is still up, get it snapshotted by the wayback machine. The UK Small claims court process i am unsure if non UK residents can do it but look, money claim online UK.
If what he is doing is fraud which it sounds like it is, report it to action fraud UK with all the details.
[ I am not sure how this will help, but i have heard of people claim stuff like this when abroad and paying a HCEO to seize business assets, but chances are he has very few of those, and they just wind the down the company and start a new one, though did you do a contract with him or the company? If with him, you can sue direct. I would go on the legal advice UK reddit as someone else suggested.
I would report him to the UK authorities with all details you know, and post his name, and whatever details on him you can to ripoffreport and that will tarnish his name until the cows come home.
Note there are two directors, not one.

But we don't need I told you so, he has learned his lesson from his post. He already has been hurt enough. I have been to SEA countries, $5k can change your life, its more than a year's salary in a retail or construction job. For him, that would have been his work up the ladder out of poverty that millions of people I have seen are in every day, hence why I do not have apathy. Was he silly especially regarding working so long without milestone payments, maybe he was, but it is still a horrible loss so I wouldn't rub it in further. If your bitcoins were stolen now, I wouldn't rub it in by saying it is your fault, but I would give my advice on using hardware or multisig 2FA wallets without rubbing it in.
I am not questioning the validity of your points, but just there was a more tactful way to put it :) And this is coming from someone who is usually blunt as a dinner knife.

Nepal is on that list.
I find Nepal one of the best countries I ever set foot in, a place where kids can safely wander their local town/city alone in groups, a place where compassion was through the roof beyond anything I ever knew, no PC attitude, LGBT friendly.
I was surprised to find they had banned bitcoin, though most Nepali I met are not bothered and think Bitcoin is a good idea when you explain it to them. Many don't even realize it's banned as many do not follow politics, many towns survive from local agriculture or produce.
Nepal is odd with its currency, you cannot take its currency out of the country or in large amounts, all NPR have to be exchanged from foreign currency locally.
No mining would take place in Nepal, the power grid has bad load-shedding, and is off for up to 18 hours a day in some areas, we often ate dinner and played chess by candlelight. Landline-based internet is trash, though their mobile 3G and 4G networks work extremely well, I got a good signal even in the Pokhara mountains.

Have spent nearly a year of my life in total in various SEA countries. I have seen how hard they work, and I don't just go to tourist areas where you see the laid back stuff, I have stayed with locals who get up and go to work on a daily basis. I actually am getting married to a filipino, as well and the Philippines is in South East Asia and is an extremely crowded fast paced place to live.
Locals laughed at me when I said the average uk working week is 40 hours. Their average working week as at minimum, 70. Sometimes finishing at 11PM to have your employer asking you to be in work at 5am. None of the Filipinos nor the malaysians I know have much disposable income. Many borrow or pawn their items to buy the weeks shopping. 
In Singapore, yes the quality of life was higher in Singapore but that's a tiny dot compared to the rest.
Other places in SEA are up at sunrise doing agriculture if you go to the provinces. Many can't afford even basic medical or dental checkups and it shows in their teeth. Mentally ill people eat out of trash. My partner has gone hungry many a times, even when working full time six to seven days a week. 
In Nepal, it is much more laid back in the provinces and that and despite insane low incomes, the people there are happy and contented with their lives, but nepal is not in SEA.
I am telling you now, in some of them, more relaxed couldn't be more wrong. And the insanely long working hours are beyond any Americans perception of working hours. The constant withholding of salaries happens in a lot of them as well.

I think the community gloating of many 'noobs' who lost everything may cement that new investors will be more wary to come in.  Community infighting, lack of admitting the flaws in the perfect bitcoin (I love Bitcoin, but we need an objective discussion about its advantages and drawbacks rather than TO THE MOON or WHY IS BITCOIN LOW PRICE or BITCOIN IS PERFECT, ALL OTHER COINS ARE SHITCOINS Even though 95% of them are, but some are not, etc) is why I sold my 0.5 BTC i had invested back in 2014 at the ATH.

The problem is, many (not all) in the community treat it as a get rich quick scheme and will do anything to acquire that. Bitcoin is simply not developed enough and too volatile to replace fiat. The refusal to see outside the bubble of bitcoin to the wider areas of life has caused problems. The price going down is a reflection that something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Will it go up in the long-term? I think so, but i cannot prove that. I put my faith in silver, and a bit of crypto as an investment, after you have secured bricks and mortar over your head. Anything else is secondary. I don't care about being rich. Have enough to eat, roof over my head and enough to have a bit of fun in life? I am happy. For when I pass into spirit at the end of my life, money won't be coming with me. I am contented.
Note that Bitcoin must be mined or bought with fiat at the moment apart from the odd person who may pay for services in it. I was earning it directly from clients until they pulled out due to volatility and went back to good old fashioned bank wire... I have tried for ages to do market research with Bitcoin community more than once about opening a crypto only online store for all your day to day non perishables and shopping, and I get barely any responses and as the average joe won't be worried about that, I just shelved the idea. I think the term 'nocoiners' is just bordering on obsession. Lets just make fiat evaporate and force BTC. You just wiped out the ability of more than half the world without stable internet to transact. Heck, my friends from nepal survive on bartering in their province and have no desire to change and are happy (though they earn a bit of fiat working as well). Through all world economy ups and downs, they are still there, still plodding along.
I have been in this game since 2013, and I have hope for digital currencies, but not in their current form. I also find that there is a real world out there, outside of Bitcoin.
