ZCASH solves this problem with shielded transactions and voluntary disclosure (to be implemented)

Only BU nodes get ddos'd
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:40:21
Miners don't want thier TX fees going to a 2nd layer. You'd be against it if you were a miner.

Good price to reload at.

Captain obvious!

And because the community wouldn't stand behind anyone taking over Btc, it would be written off, a hard fork would occur and then everyone would choose sides. You know they just cant do this on their own, which is why the smear campaign helps.

BU has more than 51% hashrate? Where did you hear this? 
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:19:19
Proof?

I read a contradictory statement on slack.

He said "Jihan already has"

Don't let anyone influence your decisions on why you should or shouldn't buy Bitcoin. That's a decision you have to make yourself for the right reasons. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:17:12
If Core/BS did that off the bat, it would seem like a hostile takeover and would not be supported by the community. They are slowly discrediting (falsely and through fake news) BU in order to gain that support. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:04:41
Which part is incorrect? Are Bitfinex users not paying a premium for btc? Is it not sending the price of btc higher? 
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:45:53
Yup, they are forced to buy Btc at a premium to withdraw coins. So even if they make usd on alts, they need to buy Btc to transfer to bigger exchanges that only support btc. Isn't this a ponzi? 
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:24:55
Not going to explain segwit, but this issue won't be resolved for months, unless there is a contentious hard fork.

It's Sept 19...
@_date: 2015-04-29 04:11:09
are you guys still tracking this? 
@_date: 2015-04-29 04:21:39
you guys still tracking this? I can link origins to these transactions to specific usernames/pseudonyms who have left lots of clues.  I don't know if these guys were just scammed, or if they are the actual hackers. Need help asap. PM me 
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:35:06
check your pm.

This is important. Will bitcoins explode like tulips?

Who wrote this? Craig Wright?

You may not be minding, but others are not MINING because these prices are so low

Tulip boy follows 3 people - JVP, Ian and this account:  - "A man longing for knowledge and his sophisticated girl." The same girl? 
Also, who is XS?  "Starting April 11st 2016, this account is preserved and maintained by   XS and ..." 
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:24:50
This is even more relevant now...With everything we know today, was all of this a mirage? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:52:06
Did they cancel the order or charge you back?
