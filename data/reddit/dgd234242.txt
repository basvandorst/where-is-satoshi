If bitcoin is demonstrated to be easy to change we might as well just have a central bank.. it makes little difference whether the implementers of change are developers or central bankers they are both human and can be controlled by political manipulation.
Bitcoin is a replacement for central banking. Replacing people who can be politically swayed with a computer network which cannot. The inability to make changes to bitcoin is a core feature. Central banks don't make that many transactions (just settlements between other banks).. bitcoin in it's current form can already handle more transactions than most central banks in the world do. As with traditional banking, once secondary payment layers are added to bitcoin, only net settlement will happen on chain. Bitcoin is the foundation, the bedrock on which other layers will stand. It's not supposed to move or change. There is no need to increase onchain transaction capacity.
What we absolutely must not do is increase the block size to 2MB.. that would show that bitcoin can easily be changed (it must not be) for a change that isn't even necessary and wouldn't even achieve any meaningful short term scaling benefits.
Possibly your confusion stems from the idea that blockstream could make a change to bitcoin if only they would agree but this is false.. they can't change it anymore than anyone else can.

It isn't a small price at all.. making changes to keep the peace is _exactly_ what bitcoin must never do. If it happens, trust will be lost forever as it shows that it can be manipulated the same as existing central banking.
