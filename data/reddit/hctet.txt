Seems to be the case at the moment. People panicking, others taking advantage. We will not know the final price for a few hours yet I think.  
  
Also, I apologise, I do not want it to seem like I was poking fun at you or laughing at you over the collapse in price. The above reply was actually meant for someone over on r/ireland I was talking with over the last day or two. Accidentally replied to your comment in my inbox.  (hence the price being in Euros rather than Dollars).

I'm not saying that Facebook will not use Bitcoin, I just think that it is unlikely. I'd imagine that they would probably accept Bitcoin/Dollar/Euro etc, to buy units of whatever payment scheme they come up with (probably call them FaceBucks or something).  
Bitcoin would be outside of their control and would be unreliable. e.g. why would Facebook users continue to use a Facebook Bitcoin service for a fee when they could use any of the free wallets already out there.     
A Facebook money transfer system which they control themselves would be worth a lot more to them. Such a system would also come with the added bonus of being part of a large, trusted (even still) company as opposed to a fledgling currency which is considered by many to be little more than a ponzi scheme. Marketing devices such as FaceBuck top up cards, credit/debit cards, gift cards or even a Facebook Shop would even be a possibility in the future. Advertising revenues would skyrocket for such a system. Charges on transactions would be worth a pretty penny also.  
  
Facebook (and Zuckerberg if the stories are true) love control. At the moment they have addresses, images, likes/dislikes, etc for a good chunk of its users - imagine how much they would be worth if they had the spending habits or relative wealth of its users combined with a way for those users to spend, buy or transfer money all inside of a system of their own design.

Thank you.  
Very informative.

Haha! What a difference a few hours make, eh?. €200 at around 4pm, €89 now.  
This is crazy.   
Edit: finished typing this comment, took another quick look - €114!! What is happening?

Thank you.  
Nice explanation.

What does 'forking' mean?
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:20:59
ok I'll try

Probably create a system of their own.  
O2 (mobile phone company) in Ireland are currently offering an O2 Visa card which allows you to [send money from your own phone to someone else's]( (I'd assume both parties would have to be on the O2 network). Facebook may try a similar idea.

What the hell happened. Was 114 when I when to bed last night. 147 now. WTF?

That was an impressive tip, however:  


  
You have been given an incredible gift but you may follow through and use at least a little to help the **merchants** who are trying to use Bitcoin as a viable currency rather than an investment.  
As has been pointed out time and again here, if everyone hoards and nobody spends then Bitcoin will have been a pointless experiment.  
That is just my two Satoshis, anyway.
