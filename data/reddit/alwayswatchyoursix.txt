I do the same thing.  "Oh, you don't get the whole bitcoin thing?  Dude, download X-wallet or Y-wallet, whichever one you think you like better, and I'll send you some.  What do you do with it?  Whatever the hell you want."

I'm confused.  I live in California and I thought this bill did not pass in to effect, back in September.  Furthermore, I'm able to use LocalBitcoin, Coinbase, and Circle no problem, and have never received any such email from them as you described.
Dude...what did you do?
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:12:32
Agreed.  I don't support using Coinbase but at the same time, removing their name and arguing all this "hostile hard-fork" business  of XT is the reason behind it is just ridiculous.
If it's because there's something wrong with their wallet system or the company is engaged in unethical practices which hurt its users, then fine.
If it's because they support large blocks, then even if it's not censorship at the very least it is definitely bias.
Touting yourself as the go-to spot for Bitcoin information means that you shouldn't allow your personal bias to affect the information being offered to everyone else.
It's like teachers in schools who are creationists suddenly refusing to even mention evolution.  If your mission is to educate children and allow them to make well-informed choices, then you have to be willing to expose them to both sides of an argument.
On the other hand, if your goal is to promote the use of only one particular type of client (such as one that only uses Core nodes), then it makes sense that you'd refuse to list anyone using a different type of client.
The fact that they removed Coinbase in light of Coinbase running XT nodes tells me that everyone who supported that decision is NOT acting in good faith.
I've tried to stay out of the block-size debate as I'm not a developer, miner, or company using Bitcoin, but this sort of behavior is just reprehensible to me.
The part that really gets me is this: when I read the comments regarding the merge request on Github yesterday, it seemed the majority of people were against this idea.  But it was merged anyways.  I guess in a case like this even 75% was too high of a consensus requirement?

You got my attention....reading it now...

LibertyX mentions something about this in their FAQ.  Most of the places that LibertyX is available is through a service called Qpay.  Ask them if they use that, and have them scroll through the options on there until they find LibertyX.
As far as the pin thing, no clue.

It was written in 2002 according to the copyright marking, so unless I've got my info wrong, it's not really referring to bitcoin since that came later...

Yep, happened to me yesterday.  Stupid bot spamming message to stupid ETHMASTERRACE WILL CRUSH BITCOIN inflammatory post created by stupid throwaway account.
Stupid fear-mongering BS.
Disclaimer:  I actually am interested in Ethereum and subscribe to that subreddit too, so I thought it was actually legit until I read the whole thing and went back and did my homework.

I work with a company that does transactions based around 0-conf every single day.  Multiple transactions.  Not a single double-spend yet.  Going strong for more than a year.
When I see blanket statements like that, I just have to wonder, who exactly are these people that have all been victimized by 0-conf double-spends?  You say Shapeshift?  Okay, I can accept that.  That's ONE.  How many others?  A couple?  A few?  Fifty?  One hundred?  A thousand?  Just how many?  Because I can guarantee it's not EVERYONE.
Is 0-conf not secure?  Yes, there's definitely a higher factor of risk than a confirmed transaction.  I agree with the idea that 0-conf is not secure.  However, to argue that since it's not secure means that it has no practical value is, in my opinion, too much of a polarizing argument.
I feel like part of the problem with this argument is that it is founded on the idea that a single confirmation makes a transaction 100% legitimate.  0-conf = BAD vs 1-block-depth = GOOD.
Keep in mind that block depth is just a measurement of RELATIVE security.  The deeper a block is, the more secure it is considered to be.  There's a reason that newly generated coins aren't considered valid for 100 blocks.  There's a much higher factor of risk.  By comparison, a transaction is usually considered "confirmed" when it's six blocks deep.
I feel like the arguments for/against 0-conf transactions have actually become arguments for/against "included in block yet or not".
Personally, I believe 0-conf does have a practical use in the bitcoin world of today.  But I also believe that saying it is "safe" or "secure" is misleading.  Any system that involves using 0-conf should have some sort of risk assessment involved.
I also personally don't like Full RBF.  I would actually prefer no damn RBF whatsoever, but I'm willing to compromise at something like FSS-RBF because I see that as a safeguard against fraud.  To me, Full RBF feels too much like we're trying to create solutions to problems that aren't problems so much as mistakes.

I wish California had that.
Then again, it would probably be boycotted and vilified as evil, uncaring, racist, and xenophobic here.

After the hackjob the guys at Wired did regarding the whole Satoshi is Craig thing, I'm afraid to even click this link.
EDIT:  I was not disappointed.  The first and only time Bitcoin is mentioned:  Today, anonymity tools inspired by mix networks are used by everyone from the nearly 2 million inhabitants of the Tor anonymity network—whose messages are routed through a sort of mutated mix network of thousands of volunteer machines—to **Bitcoin spenders hiding drug transactions on the Dark Web.**
Thanks Wired, I didn't realize I was buying drugs until now.

The only time I heard someone being negative about him was someone who used his service, knowing what he charges, then thought it was unfair to actually pay him the commission.
I do know he's been scammed before also, since he trusts people.

Or don't smash it, and just wipe it instead.  Then keep the 24-word recovery phrase safe.  And bust out the Trezor again when they've updated things to where you feel reasonably certain everything is cool.

Maybe you should stop trying and just wait for the transactions to hit the account that you've already tried to add?

Too many typos to be real.  Definitely a troll page.
