If 20’s grew on trees he’d start farming them though, the whole idea of it not being worth his time plies he can’t do multiple things at once.

I’m fairly certain even Bill Gates would think something of $2,500. It’s not fair to say losing $2,500 dollars is nothing.

I'm confused... Bill Gates could make 45,000 dollars walking, or bend down and make 47,500. 
I guarantee if Bill Gates saw 2,500 on the floor he'd at least pick it up to see who's it is. So many people think "Oh he has so much money, he doesn't care about a few grand" as if him picking up a 1,000 is like me picking up a penny (more like a fraction of a penny, but you get my point). It doesn't scale, I'd be willing to bet Bill Gates would even pick up a 20 dollar bill if he saw one on the ground.

Lol find me numbers that support this, it’s not true

But what’s the point in saying that? He’s going to make the money, his earnings won’t be paused. I️ get that it’s a cool fact, but it in no way invalidates that he WOULD pick up the money in reality.

That's a 14% swing, while it's not a huge change for Bitcoin it's much more than the daily swings we see on a day-to-day basis.
I definitely think it's not smart to invest as much as he did if having the value swing this much sends you into a panic, but he did invest the money and it's fair for him to be upset regardless of whether or not he should be that deep.
