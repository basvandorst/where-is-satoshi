P.S. the relatively speaking strong dollar your speaking about over the last 5 years saw bitcoin go from less than a cent to over $1,000.

VTB - among Russia's largest banks - has signed a deal with Bank of China to pay each other in domestic currencies, bypassing the need for US Dollars for "investment banking, inter-bank lending, trade finance and capital-markets transactions."

Bad news for $
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:41:53
There is a strong correlation between some overall markets and bitcoin because of the performance of the dollar. This last week we saw the dollar take a stiff drop after the new china-russia deal was announced. That deal is one of the final nails in the $s coffin. The $ will lose reserve currencey status before 2020 and even the IMF reports worldwide holdings of $ are down to 30% in 2013 from 55% in 2000. 
tl;dr bitcoin and everything else goes up when the dollar goes down. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:28:25
If the incentive to confirm transactions becomes too small then fewer people will mine making it more profitable for those that do. Basically it balances itself out and as long as people use bitcoin miners will have an incentive to process transactions. Like gold mining it will become industrialized to cut costs as it becomes harder to do. For example see the PETA bitcoin mine, now hashing over 1petahash a second.

We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like computer science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.

The last 5 years has shown decreasing volume and a weakening dollar.
No one will buy treasuries when SHTF. Russia just dumped trillions after the gas deal announced with china and bought 900,000tons of gold. Like I said the IMF shows world reserves in $ at 55% in 2000. Now down to 30%. It is happening now, its not right around the corner. It is here right now. To put that in perspective 15 years ago 1 out of 2 of every dollar a country held in reserve was $. Now it is 3/10. It won't be much longer until an all out dump of treasuries happens probably in connection with a declaration of war or terrorist event.

fiat currency is inflationary. (hold $ and you lose value)
bitcoin money is deflationary. (hold bitcoin and you gain value)
Money is defined as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value.
The $ fails as a store of value but does OK for the other two.
Bitcoin excels in all three categories. 
Therefore an argument can be made that bitcoin is money and the $ is not. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:46:12
From my understanding this could happen as early as 2016. If that is the case then it could lead to an all out war on bitcoin, coordinated by every government that owes money to the IMF and BIS. Who wins is anyone's guess. I'm withdrawing from the banking cartels and moving to bitcoin. Not because it is a smart move economically but because it is the moral thing to do. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:26:23
The $ will not be the world reserve currency for much longer. The fed knows it. So they can encourage a new global standard for currency that no one nation controls Or they can shoot our own foot off and China becomes the new world superpower.

Yes, but this is the dawn of bitcoin not the end. I'm throwing a small amount into it, if it pays off it will be great, if not then I hope everyone involved listened to the 'don't invest more than you are ready to lose' posts. This is the wild west of the internet folks, gotta risk it to win it.

I see your point but find it a very unlikely possibility and even if it happens I don't think bitcoin will implode, it will change and be more common in the countries that allow it. It would still grow, just maybe not as fast depending on the black market demand for the money that hurts the fed. History says it would only increase demand. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:04:55
Basically what they are saying is that a mining group would not report the block they solved and try to solve the next one. Then everyone else would waste time on the block that was 'solved'. Problem is if they don't report it then that block will become orphaned. The critical part of this BS story is that it relies on the network effect of a profitable mining group to attract more miners because it is the most profitable. Yet they will not be able to do this attack continuously so becoming the most profitable to begin with will not happen. 
tl;dr chances are less than 6% per block of this attack being successful, good luck winning the disrupt bitcoin lottery on those odds. Especially when the miners figure out the group they are participating in is hurting the investment.

Disparity of wealth, possibly but this isn't a negative of bitcoin. That is just reality. 
Your other two points seem to come from a misunderstanding of bitcoin and the effect deflation has had and will continue to have. It has been in a state of deflation sense day one and that won't change, yet investment, lending and the bitcoin economy as a whole continues to grow at record speed. I think bitcoin lending is what will ultimately put the banks out of business.

They can't. They would go bankrupt trying. The more they buy, the higher the price goes and we can keep adding 0s.

Bitcoin is an all or nothing. It's either going to replace the fiat currencies or it won't. On a competition basis bitcoin has major advantages and a big head start. 
User error is not a fault of bitcoin. Services will rise to help those who are to stupid to read first and buy second. Using multiple wallets and paper backup is just good sense.

Bitcoin is a lot of things, not just pure speculation although that is what causes the volatility. The trend is up and it is designed to stay that way.

They can not control bitcoin, it has no central authority. They could seize all the miners inside the country but what of those outside? Any direct attack on bitcoin will only make it stronger. It is like a hydra, cut off one head, two more rise. This is the beauty of open source technology and it will revolutionize the world with or without the worlds consent.

"discredits any currency that is not backed by the federal reserve or its equivalent" they do this and bitcoin will go through the roof, thats basically admitting it is a threat to the system. 
Buy in small regular intervals. A buy and hold strategy is best for those who don't have a finger on the pulse of the market. 
P.S.  "What are ways to prevent people from stealing whatsoever" Paper wallet. basically this is cold storage, the only people that can get them need access to the piece of paper. its as easy as scanning the QR code to get them back into a virtual wallet.

If the network could verify a vote. No one could vote twice, you could vote anonymously, and you can use your voteraddress to lookup your vote in the votechain so you know your vote was counted and counted correctly. It could also be done from any computer or possibly smartphone.

Well I agree bitcoin has room to grow in a niche market, but I think overall it will replace the main currencies. Just on a side by side comparison, it has all the advantages. As to the ease of use and irreversibility of payments, this just demonstrates an opportunity in the market. Services will rise to help protect people who want to pay a little extra for a guarantee (a bitcoin PayPal or PayPal adoption)  but as for that being a negative on bitcoin I disagree. Its a positive from the gambling industries point of view, which I think will be one of the first markets bitcoin really breaks into.

"no one will want in." Only brainwashed westerners. Anyone with half a brain understands the divisibility of bitcoin makes this a non issue. $27 today will appreciate just as fast as $27 a year ago, the trend has ramped up this year but I think that is in part due to the reduction of bitcoins created per block.

EDIT: "of course the governement can threaten Bitcoins." Let them come.

Well then please clarify, because the traditional sense of too big to fail is that it rested on leverage. Bitcoin does not.

I don't think your getting it. You would have a randomly generated key/receipt. You would be the only one with it and you could use it to check the public vote record. We would see the election in real-time and it would be anonymous like bitcoin. 
Wether or not someone pays you to vote a certain way... that is on you personally.

Bitcoin is doing something that has never happened before in the history of mankind. Hang on to your hats folks, it will be a bumpy ride but we are going to the moon.

Thanks, herd a rumor they started moving them but couldn't find the address to check it out. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 14:59:19
The network would require registration, it would limit you to only vote once. If it used a public and private key system like bitcoin it could remain anonymous.

Debunked. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:23:03
All true, and we still have a few billion people to add. ;)
Except we also lose bitcoins.

Will central banks invest in the competition when they know they are outmatched? If they can invest before they lose all the purchasing power of fiat, will it spark a bitcoin arms race among the central banks still standing over the new one world currency?

If you have patience and don't mind paying a premium then no, it is the best way to buy. Now put it in a paper wallet and stash it away. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:28:39
Awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:28:05
The market can anticipate this change but it still has an effect. 
For reference, look at the chart and compare before 2013 to this year. Its drastically different and i think it will change again in 2017.

Peoples wages will always be fiat because businesses run on the currency that they pay taxes in. Immature was 2 years ago, 5 years old in the internet is basically young adult. See wired's new article. Wealth disparity is not an issue. Its reality. Some people have, some do not. Bitcoin overall will make all of its adopters better off vs holding fiat.

Has the FBI moved the coins? 
@_date: 2013-04-20 14:55:10
Problematic? Why?It would be a completely anonymous vote, how is that not a secret ballot?

Invest in XBOND and get bitcoin daily dividends and double your coins every 5 years while they increase in value.

I haven't had a problem with them yet, love the craps table ;)

Design a scalable self sufficient community. 
Build a country on top of the pacific garbage patch. 
Fund Star Trek Enterprise to go to the moon and plant a bitcoin flag.

Yes you are. Now you can either learn from this or do it again. BUY AND HOLD. zero coin it then repeat, BUY AND HOLD. Don't try to play day trader, the autorobots are now in control of the volatility. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:51:12
No, its even less effective and less likely than the 51% attack.

The bitcoin network is more powerful than the top 500 supercomputers put together. Even if they could build the Frankenstein monster of computers bitcoin has the ability to adapt and update its protocol. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 14:54:01
What would you replace it with?I believe a republic is the best option. I am not talking about using BTC at all here. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 14:48:59
I guess I should of clarified that a currency wouldn't be involved, unless it was necessary to create the network. In that case I imagine that there would be a limit at the amount of voters and each voting season miners can switch the rigs over to mine votecoin or whatever it is, as a reward for verifying the vote?There would have to be an authentication process similar to the exchanges to make an account. In that way you only vote once and not generate to infinity.  Like voter registration, but they generate new addresses for each vote or voting season.
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:02:21
In three years only 12.5 will be created every minute, 4 years later 6.25. This is deflationary, the rate of new currency entering the market is decreasing.

ummm.... no, not even close. You can call biden's syria remark a gaffe, this was a promise. Here watch.
He PROMISED, multiple times, on camera. Liberals 'dubunked' conservatives who raised the alarm early based off his promise. No sir, that was a straight up lie to every single american. 
Journalists should do some research before they write but that is not the case with mainstream reporters these days, i agree they will have to be led because most don't think for themselves.
