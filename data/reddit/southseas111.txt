That only works with QR codes at football games.

Is this the same group of libertarians who wanted to get a lot of the same into NH to basically take over the government?

I think you need to have the input and output of bitcoin be as simple as a credit card swipe.... MAYBE a iphone app level of difficulty. But short of that many people will not find the benefits of bitcoin to outweigh the bother. Think how easy paper and metal coins have been around. That design clearly has a lot of positives that a new currency has to do better than.

I think (and I am new and have not done this) you can keep a wallet as a file, rather than as paper image. Basically the file would contain your 2 keys. Once it is a file you can USB just the file. Of course you could also just save the paper image as a jpg and USB that.
Keep in mind though that if you have 1$ on paper and you send 20cents from that wallet the 80cents goes on to a newly created wallet, and effectively is gone because you don't have the private key to that. SO BE VERY CAREFUL MOVING MONEY OUT OF A PAPER WALLET. Generally you will want to move the full paper amount into an online wallet. You can add bits an pieces of money to a paper address no problem, but moving less than all of it from the paper, and you're going to have a bad time.

This is a pretty good article about the ledger strength of bit coin. Cash has no such thing. So cash will always be the choice for crime.

I think so. 
1) Get coinbase purchase of bitcoins. This is done by linking your bank account and putting in a buy. 
2) Now go to any of several paperwallet printers. This is a piece of paper with at least 2 things: 1 private key (long list of letter number) and 1 public key (long list of letter number). They probably also have a QR code corresponding to each key. Print out that paper. If you are really concerned, do that offline.
3) Coinbase has a button to the left allowing you to send payment. Hit that, but put you public key on the paper into the payment address. I would recommend sending a small amount to start here.
4) Go out to 
and see if the money made it over to this new code after you replace the long string of numbers and letters in the address above with the public key you have.
5) Give it a few mins (like 30) before panicking that something went wrong. Once you are ok, repeat but with the larger amount.
6) Take care of that piece of paper - particularly that private key. It is the password to let you get back at that bitcoin.

Why are so many r/bitcoiners such assholes. They all act like they are gods among the ants.

I don't understand hash. But when ever I see it I think hash browns which are delicious. So I hope bit coins succeed.

This detail about spending part of the money from a paper wallet should be a glowing 8 foot neon letters.

Just think about the huge pop in bitcoin value once people realize the fees are gone from the cost. It will be like Amazon's current advantage in terms of sales tax.
