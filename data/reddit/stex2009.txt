Why not get some good penny stock instead! More chances of winning than BTC In my opinion.

Send it to the bank. Report him! Can that work?

No, I don't think you are late to mine if you try to see a good balance when to mine and when to buy the coins. Mining can be very profitable if done with right kind of machines at the right time.

 Is there a way to run these USB miners 24hrs without keeping your system ON throughout.

CHASE: I got my account closed down by chase being a hish risk customer. Not sure why this happened. I tried to speak with higher level reps and nobody had any good answer. My chase account activity was very minimal with cash flow, but had some 10k-20k cash. The only reason I liked chase was their number of branches in my city.
Which banks are good if you trading BTC ?

There's a possibility, they can make it illegal to trade BTC as it encourages money transmissions without any supervision or authority. Who knows!

For coinbase, it Makes sense to have the confirmation of funds in your account to give you BTC. I don't think they do that but if you buy more BTC than the funds you have you will be charged overdraft and you will be responsible for all the charges. Seems scary, and I try to be very careful for the same fact!
