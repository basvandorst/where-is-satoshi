How good is investopedia for learning how to trade crypto? 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:42:24
I’m not looking into day trading I thought something more like swing trading or trying to time the market if I think an opportunity is coming 
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:03:49
I think this is going to be a good month 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:53:10
Look at last year.... I’m not saying it’s likely or that it’s going to happen but your argumentation is flawed 
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:58:45
And then? Let’s say you’re right, do you believe the price will drop after it reaches $12k?

How will teens use bitcoin for sex?

*domb it
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:31:38
Hhmm what do you mean by “know what you are doing”? I’m asking because you said that the fluctuations are ‘random’ (to us) so isn’t it just like gambling?
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:29:25
Not sure if that’s entirely true. I’m 18 and everyone around me is talking about Bitcoin as if it’s the easiest method to get rich but most of them never even owned any crypto (or stocks) so I think there are still a lot of potential naive buyers 
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:34:40
I really think that the McAfee Dick Line has an psychological effect on a lot of people 
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:27:10
Me too :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:00:28
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:17:05
Interesting...I’m not saying you’re wrong but what makes you think that? 
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:31:18
Are you sure it’s impossible? I mean bitcoin has a tendency to do what previously seemed impossible 
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:32:56
Well with crypto almost nothing is certain and most things are possible :)
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:35:41
I agree, I believe we will certainly see a new ATH before January but before August would be very good for me personally 
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:39:50
Do you guys believe bitcoin will reach 100.000$? If so when?
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:29:32
Pls explain
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:14:39
It’s called dollar cost averaging. I think in the case of bitcoin it’s a reasonable idea but it’s a controversial investing strategy 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:33:23
Now I understand. Thank you very much
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:03:06
Where do you guys believe will be the top this time?
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:41:35
Will it go under 7500$ in the next few weeks?
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:58:35
Hmm we’re way higher than the mcafee curve right now. Let’s just hope this man doesn’t have to eat his own dick
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:47:10
So no major dips like 2 weeks ago any more?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:41:43
So you think its dropping to ~6k again? 
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:49:58
Thought I was the only one this crazy 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:09:21
Why is it a mental barrier? I never understood that 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:16:45
Just bought 200€ at 8800...stupid decision? (I’m 18 so 200€ is not a very small amount for me)
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:44:34
Already under 9.8k
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:58:57
Thats what i‘m hoping for. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:12:28
Wow the FOMO Hit you hard didn’t it?

I do what I can to help the community 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:45:49
i understand that. What I don’t understand is the correlation between rounded off numbers and it being more difficult for bitcoin to reach rounded  off prices or milestones. I know nothing about economic psychology or money in general for that matter. I just starting to gain interest in these things
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:51:34
Then how come there are successful traders? I’m not saying I’m doing it but some people seem to be very lucky
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:02:56
Where do you guy see the price in late juli or early August 
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:22:11
Can’t argue with that
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:26:34
Please explain 
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:22:46
Where should I store my 0,1BTC? Do i need a Hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:48:36
The formula for success
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:42:16
Thanks  that was the answer I was hoping for :)
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:51:26
Do you guys believe bitcoin could be at 100000$ by the end of this year?
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:35:11
Can you explain why it’s trash? I’m not saying that it isn’t I’m just genuinely curious to know what’s the problem with bcash since it’s following thinks it’s so much better then Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:09:07
A few DAYS?!? That would be awesome but what in the world makes you think that?
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:56:28
I hope it’s either $999 or $20,001.
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:13:52
When Bitcoin hits the new ATH, how could one know when to sell in order to  buy back in in the pullback?
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:59:39
New ATH this year?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:37:14
What’s Bitcoins utility? How do you guys se it being used in 10-20 years?
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:48:11
Pretty spot on 
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:11:29
Explosive in every thing is going to blow UP or in everything will go down in flames?
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:48:52
Let’s say late July 
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:02:07
Hope that Happens again
