You really need to join a pool. With 45 Mhash/s, on average, you'll find a block every 173 days.  You need to be able to find a block at least every 2 weeks(every difficulty change) to consider solo mining.

Everyone in the industry knew the NSA was doing this on the "public" internet traffic of American citizens. No one expected them to have these direct taps onto Google's lines.

Not exactly true. While you can't convert your isk directly to cash, you can pay for your monthly subscription with isk. Makes the economy interesting because this exchange is done on the in-game market with other players and not directly through the company.
This is similar to how it would have to work for bitcoins if you want a legit bidirectional exchange. The bitcoin-&gt;isk* and isk*-&gt;bitcoin transactions would all be player to player transactions, ideally over an in-game interface. All big online games with an a semi-meaningful currency have unofficial buying/selling going on if you look hard enough. Bitcoins just make it simple to officially support the process and make it easy and transparent.


Sure there are isk generators in game, but there are many isk sinks to compensate. When your ship is destroyed all your loot doesn't drop to be picked up by another player, only half. That's the most significant one, but others are taxes on market transactions, buying of medical and jump clones, and repairing.
