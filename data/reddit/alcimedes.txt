Been here a little while.

Not much we can do about that I'm afraid, but we did have a lot of supporters asking for the option.

I'll have him check into one.  I know the service we're using was free for non-profits, and had an easy API for us to use.  But it would be nice to not have a cap.
Honestly, it's not like donations normally come rushing in so fast it would be an issue.

Mason has done a great job getting the message out, especially the comparison to alcohol.

Something to that effect.  After $1,000 on the day they shut off our ability to accept any more Bitcoin until they processed what we'd gotten.
Something to do with how new our account was at the time.

I had no idea that was even a thing.  Learn something new every day!

People would expect a package in return.

I posted this once before two months ago, but then you guys donated so much we hit our daily cap and they shut us down for a bit.
Our staffer got our daily limit raised from $1k to $10k though and asked that I post it again.
So, here you go.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask, and I wanted to say thank you to everyone who donated last time around and pushed us over the top.  That was very unexpected!

Ha, yes.

Full disclosure, I work there.  I'm not trying to hide this and if it's against the rules please nuke this post with my apologies.
We just got our first bitcoin donation tonight though.  :)

Thank you!  The amount of progress made in the last ten years is pretty amazing.

Oh shit, they're on to me.
