Volume traffic seems different a bit though, hope it won't matter in the long run.

Yes, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer anyway. I thought this applies everywhere though at least to scenario of you having non-money something on exchange and exchange it to another non-money item so that it is not taxed, otherwise I would like common sense think that trading virtual axe for virtual sword in world of warcraft will be taxable (as even those might have fiat value).
Good luck with more complex US tax rules then!

Depends where you live perhaps, but in US or EU countries, if you spend on goods and services that is taxable event on capital gains rate (ie you convert crypto to fiat -&gt; tax , you buy with that fiat).
Now there is almost zero taxes until you convert to fiat, trading btc to ltc to eth back and forth goes without taxes. The moment you use it for something valued in fiat that's taxed generally.
Some countries might have much better tax regime than others though.

At least they don't need to be government people anymore. Sure huge corrupted corp greedmongers are not the best but even more average folks get a shot at something.

oh yes, damm, my bad :-(  does crypto assets fall under one of those exclusions as well then ?

Hey sorry also pretty much average Joe here, few seminars on crypto taxes they told us general rule that as soon as it touches anything outside exchange then pay tax. And for whatever happens inside exchange gov does not care as that is  not money movements. (So tax needs to be paid for every fiat widthrawal of any kind), that's the version I am sticking with.

Let's hope not in 2018! yet ;-)

Correct, but converting means only converting to fiat or buying something
real / service with fiat value.
But if you trade btc to ltc , it can be treated as likewise and therefore no loss no profit  by IRC 1031 ( , which goes same for stocks (if you sell stock A and use all proceeds to buy stock B - no cashing out). 
(There is similar mechanism in EU - at least my country)
Lot of it also depends how you and your accountant can put numbers down... 
I am not accountant and know there will be some taxes at the end, but before I buy service/good or cash out, pretty much none.

You can only hope someone reads that and maybe will better off from it :-) then it’s probably enough effect

1% price difference seems ok, every exhcange have different rates and fees and hidden fees (in exchange rate)

If purchasing any service or physical goods counts as conversion even when bought with crypto then it is a bit tricky. Otherwise yes as long as you don't convert to fiat there is no tax in most countries.

Assuming you folks have something in stocks as well (blue chip dividends get much more than 17cent), you can buy crypto which will make $17 value increase per month , to demonstrate it takes just $200 to get same gain as $20k . But start small , don’t put all eggs in one basket, seeing how $1k grows will make it easier to increase position and diversify more.

use the book! :-), chapter 4 , 
and some python code there related to secp256k1 :

that's a good idea! how far is that off, like remind me in 3 years ?

Let's hope it is also lesson for him and he will not repeat such mistake. Best finance education is to lose some money after all...

Usually people lose some arguments when you tell them Japan fully legalized it.
