Didn't ethereum think of something that let's you call your wallet an address in the form of a domain? Like...if I want to buy an iPhone, I would send to he wallet APPLE.ETH? I forgot the entire thing but I believe bids are happening for the domains.

Bitcoin is gold that backs all cypto. Ethereum is the silver all businesses run on. Litecoin is the pocket change everyone spends day to day. All other cryptos, are just parts the big 3. That's how I see it.

It means it's about to rise like nuts. All the poeple who sold will do anything and everything to make up for there losses...including buying back at something insane like $17K.

Wall-street bonuses come in tomorrow. Someone is manipulating the heck out of the market...like how many people out there can even afford to throw around 1 mill into something so volatile.

It's a currency...not a stock. Your literally asking how much do money you have?  Just because someone has money in Euros doesn't give you the right to ask no? Now, it would be like asking about stocks if you only ask the person what price you bought BTC at or how long ago? If someone asks me how much I have now, it's a no go.

It's all documented right here in the. Reddit thread:

If only it had an app and mint integration:(

You know..how about I going to throw the cash now. We didn't really think this Bitcoin thing through 0.0

So, I wonder how that dude who paid off his house by selling feels...
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:17:51
Yes! This is exactly what I think. Ethereum will be the exchange currency since it's faster and they are working on that new system. I forgot the name, but you can send to wallets/addresses that look like "Reddit.eth" instead of djdiej83837_+'83+rie77373djdejn". That is an amazing feature once it is fully developed. All in all, Bitcoin will be the backing off all other currencies.

Exchanges such as coinbase actually pass it on to the next of kin if you fill out the right paperwork.  Search it up :)

You know...if things go wild, they just set off some EMP's. No internet, bitcoin dies. Cash has power at certain times and the smartest people understand that. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:07:13
It's valued at a lot more. It just wasn't ready. The point is, if bitcoin can manage to hit such a high number in a matter if a weeks, it could happen again...at anytime. But more likely, it will take time. The people who made out big aren't idiots who bought in December. They are ones that bought years ago. Like any investment (that isn't a scam), time is money.

We're getting pretty close to 8k no? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:06:29
Should I buy in or wait to hit $8100

The ETF has to do with Bitcoin which is why it's rising in the first place. Altcoins are a concern for later
@_date: 2018-07-20 04:56:12
Interesting, where can I do this?
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:47:36
So...about that 8k
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:09:38
Hype. That's all

It's that domain they want. Forget the brand
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:06:22
It might be I they use it right. I'm sure they want the team as well and what not.

haha, most idiots would go buy an island and say "not my problem. let the government deal with it"...
