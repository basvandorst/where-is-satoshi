The biggest investment in Bitcoin in Brazil is called MMM, was invented by a russian and is a ponzi. 
The second biggest investment is another ponzi, Minerworld, which sells mining power without having a single miner running. They alone have cropped millions of dollars from greedy people.
Last year a group was jailed, they were selling Kryptacoin for people, promessing 10% return a day. Needless to say say there were no crypto involved and none of the them had any kind of technical background. They were able to steal more than 95 million dollars!!
Source: I live in São Paulo and I'm in Bitcoin since late 2009.
I'm in it for the idea behind it, I'm not an investor.
I have never invested in titles or companies, I don't have money on banks, 100% crypto, mainly BTC and ETH.
TL;DR; 
Unfortunately the vast majority of brazilians are in for a get rich quick scheme...

I've just read $44 million was recently moved on the Ethereum network with a tax of only $0.13. 
My question is, whould we be able to achieve such low taxes before some on-chain/off-chain solution appear? 
Is it possible/feasible with the current status of the network?
