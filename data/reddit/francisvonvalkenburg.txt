I have no idea.  I only started hosting it a few days ago and the location is remote.  I will check tomorrow morning, thanks for pointing this out.  I was convinced that the miner1 board was bad.

That could be, but that has nothing to do with my comment.  The reason it is smart is because it is accessible and not sketchy.  Whether its going to profit, I don't know.  
But right now it's a big billboard for Bitcoin in a high traffic location, especially with holiday shoppers headed out.

This is internet culture, we want everything right now.
I recently moved a 50 TH/s mine from Eligius to p2pool and that was a big mess just for that sized mine.  I can't imagine what these guys would be dealing with.

I'm hosting a terraminer IV for a friend in my warehouse where it's climate controlled.  Miner 1 consistently dies and the unit needs to be rebooted by the old "unplug both, plug one in first, then count to 3, plug the second one in"
I would have to say, that BFL hardware, though it's a total rip off, had quality way beyond cointerra hardware.

Well, it seems that they do accept Bitcoin, you just don't like their policy.
Their job is not to encourage you to use Bitcoin, its to get money for their product.  But I don't think what she said is discouraging she's giving you an option on how to avoid that particular policy.
Besides, if you're going to post damning conversation, why don't you post the conversation that leads up to it as well to provide context for that response next time.

How do you verify an identity or mailing address with a Bitcoin-only solution?
@_date: 2014-06-22 05:17:07
I've been thinking that p2pool should be integrated directly into the bitcoin core some how.  It would make it so much easier for people to use and more people would probably use it if all you had to do was turn on your bitcoin client/wallet and point your miners at it.

Bitcoin has been in some of the major network television shows.  Usually shows like CSI:LOLHackers or whatever, where they have some hip computer wiz who always has to explain crazy technology to old-school badass cops.
However, "Bitcoinica the Movie" would be interesting.

I'm not an expert on this, but I recall something along the lines of PoS requiring a master key or something.

Given that so many people watch Fox News, you are surprised about what exactly?
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:59:25
Because its not downtown.

A situation where the purchaser of product and the accountant are not the same person.  This gives the accountant insight into the finances of the company without having to hound the other people for the information.

Sure, but every item that I shipped out had a tracking # and never had a complaint filed against me on there.
I sold A LOT of hardware on there.

Why is it taking 4 days?  Complete your profile for instant purchases.  Then at least you'll know right away if you're getting your coins or not.

Your customers will understand.  You cannot buy gift cards at any small business with a credit card.  I worked for a medium sized chain and it was still "cash/debit only."  Larger stores can afford a small loss like this.  But small business needs to cover its ass.

-1 for being uptight and overlooking the obviousness of the post.
@_date: 2014-12-24 01:24:52
Nope, but I will now.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:00:58
This is the answer. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 14:19:08
Is your website custom built?
Wordpress's woocommerce has Coinbase plugins it also has features to allow for content download after payment is made.
Could be the easiest solution for you.
But I'll never discourage building your own.  Just be sure to test it a lot, and have someone with pentest knowledge look over your source/site.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:52:05
So many up votes, take it to Bitcoingonewild or whatever.

Short term workaround to start accepting bitcoin is easy.  Keep credit card on file, pay with bitcoin and if the disc doesn't come back, hit the credit card with fees.
Long term solution?  It's hard to envision this type of service being Bitcoin only.
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:53:41
Rushing into things is not what we need.  Until I can pay my mortgage and bills in Bitcoins directly without a USD basis, I don't want 100% of my check in Bitcoins.  
Bitcoins are good for online purchasing and large fund transfers right now.
Remember, no one gets paid in gold either.  At least not widely.
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:53:18
Kraken should get their shit together in the US first.  They don't even offer USD trading in all 50 states yet, now they're looking to go international?
Maybe it's easier to accomplish that in Japan?

Amazon seller story:
Unfortunately that doesn't even matter.  I shipped hardware to a buyer, provided tracking and everything.  The package was delivered and he filed an A-to-Z claim against me within minutes of the delivery confirmation.  He actively refused to talk to fedex to help sort out the issue.  Amazon awarded him his money back the next day without even hearing what I had to say about it.  I appealed it and they said, "you failed to guarantee delivery," I asked them how I can do that?  They said they didn't have any recommendations.
Sellers get screwed so hard online when using these 3rd party sites.

Heard about it on 4chan shortly after release.  Got in at beginning of GPU phase, made buckets of bitcoins.  Threw them away on BFL preorders, lived in the Bitcoin poor house until Litecoin bailed me out.

Can't you use a normal computer PSU for this?  My SC single has a pcie port on it.

Well, I misread the information and had no idea what they were saying in the video.  But there is plenty of information gathering going on in modern vending machines.  Don't fool yourself and think that your personal data associated with your credit card is only stored for your reference later.

Doesn't this defeat the purpose of p2pool?  From my understanding p2pool is just a client to let people mine under their own control while keeping the mining decentralized.  
Which brings up the question, is there something equivalent to a 51% attack that can occur inside the p2pool network?
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:47:04
I'm not sure I should trust what you have to say.
Also, in times like this I really miss bitmit.
@_date: 2014-12-24 01:23:06
Right, me either.  But someone way before us gave in.  In fact, this isn't even a vending machine.  It's more like a bartering machine.  We're trading property.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:41:04
It is a smart location.  That mall is reachable by all forms of public transportation.  So anybody can easily reach it. 
The next best place imo would be Lloyd Center, same reason, but not downtown.  Or any other shopping mall for that matter.
Also, the malls provide security, so less likely to find someone trying to tamper with it.

I have a comment for every transaction I have ever made and never had any problems with Coinbase as a result.

Usually credit unions are free.  All it usually takes to keep them open is to have at least $5 in your savings account.  That's how all of the CUs I've ever been a member of has operated.

One more question, do the Jalapenos really get hot enough that you can warm your coffee on them?
@_date: 2014-12-24 01:24:33
We were prompted with something like "complete your profile of information we don't need for legal reasons before we can give you a receipt online."  
So, in most cases you're right.  But in many cases I actually experienced, it was completely unreasonable the amount of info they want from you for no reason.
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:35:11
What are you putting in for the difficulty increment??
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:50:11
It's still the same, it's just now it takes a lot more money up front to make those big gains.
@_date: 2014-09-07 06:01:11
If they are lowering their threshold for what they defined fraud to be just to flag accounts to up sell, I'd say that it is unacceptable.
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:10:50
Excellent, glad to have access to a reputable exchange again.
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:59:11
You provided no context for your questions.  We have no idea what kind of Bitcoin user you are.  That makes all the difference in the world.
Ignoring the lack of context here.  Running away from Coinbase because of this issue isn't going to fix anything.  This will just keep catching up to you everywhere you go, and in 2 years you'll be posting the same topic about a different company.
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:06:47

Haha, I'm talking about a vending machine at my old college that accepted credit cards.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:56:44
I think that is one of those most common beliefs of the anti-Bitcoiner.   statement I hear just like the topic of this thread says.

There's also a plugin that enables you to use electrum to receive payments.
What I want to see is a plugin that works for WP-invoice invoices.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:35:25
I'll switch in a heartbeat if you integrate with WP-Invoice.
Dreaming, integration with quickbooks ;) ;) ;)
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:15:24
Well, they may not take your picture, but they sure do log your info when you pay with any method other than cash.  The credit card vending machines we had in college required an email address for receipts.

I operate SEGMining.com a Co-Location service for miners.  I was declined for a Braintree account because of the type of business I operate.  However, I was given a PayPal account with no problem.  I don't get it.
