Thanks for commenting this. Really useful. Question - if I go through these steps, do I have to keep track of how much I have in my wallet? Or when I decide to empty it, is there a way to just transfer everything at once, as opposed to a specific amount?

Also, I would think that other technology might be invented by then. Who's to say that Bitcoin will still be in use?

What are $100 checkpoints?

What does this mean? Can you explain to someone who's not very knowledgeable about Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:28:18
Can you explain further and provide a reference?
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:18:06
Thanks. Good answer.

Doesn't regulation go against the whole point of Bitcoin?

I've created an account. I'm not seeing anybody else online/games available, but I can check again daily or so. Or if someone wants to message me and set up a game, I'm interested!

Are you not posting links supporting these?

What's stamp?

I second this question.

Okay. So 3-5 of 20 symbols is only 3,368,000 possible unique Gliphs. Do you not anticipate more than that many users (I mean, I know Bitcoin isn't used *everywhere*, but still...)? Or would you possibly expand that number over time?
@_date: 2013-09-07 15:35:05
I accounted for that. If you had 3 in a row, there would be 20 * 20 * 20 possibilities. 4 would be 20^4, and 5 would be 20^5. The total would be 20^3 + 20^4 + 20^5 = 3,368,000 possible unique Gliphs.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:26:17
So does everyone have a set of three symbols that represent their Gliph account? How does that work?
@_date: 2013-04-07 05:31:55
I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-09-07 15:45:11
Right, but that would only make sense if you have 5 possible symbols and your Gliph was 20 symbols long.
