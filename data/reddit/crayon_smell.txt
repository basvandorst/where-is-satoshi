For sale here along with several other bitcoin themed pieces...
To buy with btc, checkout with 'other' as the payment method and message me for the payment address.

I tried openbazaar when it first launched but the requirement to leave the computer on in order to have the store available was a deal breaker.

Sure! And thanks for the tip!

Yea I'm accepting bitcoin there. You just gotta select 'Other' as the payment type when you checkout and then message me for the address. Etsy doesn't have any integrated bitcoin support yet.

Yea I like the style of Kells. Also, Genndy Tartakovsky (clone wars, samurai jack, etc) has a similar style and was also an inspiration. Thanks for noticing!
