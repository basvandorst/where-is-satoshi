Obviously instructions can easily be removed and replaced with false ones. 
A well promoted video will help prevent situations like this since it preys on the users ignorance. 
Most people aren't going to go straight to eBay when they first hear about Ledger. They will likely Google it first. The video can be at the top of the search. It can be on the Amazon page too. If you notice there a tons of posts about buying a ledger off Amazon, but not many about eBay. 
This shouldn't be required, but it can only help.

There are unboxing and set up video on Youtube that show how it's properly done. 
If they watched those then they wouldn't be unaware.
Ledger should make an official Youtube channel with set up guides that warn people to stop if the process is different.

The problem is until recently women didn't have even have the chance. Even though there has been great strides in women's rights. You can't instantly undo centuries of social conditioning and oppression.
Just a couple generations ago in the early 19th century it was believed that physical activity and mental labor was dangerous and inappropriate for women. 




Imagine growing up with the aspirations of being frail and weak. Typically, women were also not allowed to be educated or gain knowledge outside of the home. Women were purposely kept ignorant and meek. 
I don't know how old you are, but a lot of people don't realize this wasn't that long ago.  Depending on ages, This might have been how your great grandma was raised. 
WW2 is what led to women finally entering STEM fields. With so many men fighting there was a shortage of workers which lead to women being trained in fields that were previously viewed as being for men only.  But these women had to give up their jobs when the men came back and society still disapproved. The idea that women belonged in the home was still heavily enforced. Women needed permission from their husband or fathers to go to school and work.
My grandma couldn't even get an apartment since she was unmarried and her father didn't support her. It was considered extremely inappropriate to rent to a single woman. Any woman living on her on was assumed to be a prostitute. Without a man it was also nearly impossible to get a car or a credit card. 
Even women married to other scientists, which many women in STEM were, were unlikely to find employment. If their husband tried to get them a job working with them anti-nepotism laws would be enforced to prevent it. 
The opportunities just weren't there. For the lucky few that did land jobs they often had secretary work dumped on them to keep them from doing research and any research they did do was often stolen by men. 
Ever hear of Rosalind Elsie Franklin? Her work led to the discovery of the molecular structures of DNA. She obtained the very first image of DNA. James D. Watson and  Francis Crick got the credit and a Nobel Prize for it. 
Even in the US it wasn't until the 1980s that women had the same opportunity to go to college as often as men. So it's no shock that men are still at the top of the field. 
In my family my sisters are the first generation that has equal opportunity to enter STEM.

I use Bittrex, you need to transfer from coinbase, that's the norm with exchanges. It varies, BTC takes the longest to transfer.

Why not just put Kanye on it instead? 
I'm sure that's what he really wants.

Isn't it only users with "at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-15 period."
