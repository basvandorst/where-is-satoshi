Well except for the fact that all people holding bitcoin at that time will likely see the value plummet. While personally I don't think a 51% attack is a serious threat, for those that do, knowing that they could just trade their bitcoins for another crypto (assuming they can do it quickly enough) isn't going to alleviate their concerns.

A lot of people who pirate content already pay for things like premium access to file sharing websites, or a usenet provider etc. So I don't think its unreasonable to think that pirates would be willing to pay seeders if it meant they could get consistent high speed downloads, especially it was legal and if the majority of the payment went to the content creator. It would all depend on how much the costs were though.
It would be interesting to see what would happen if a content creator, rather than trying to take down illegal copies of their content, instead provided a legal torrent that would require payment. Some of that payment would go to the seeders, incentivising them to seed their legal copy instead of the illegal one. In that case would someone choose to download the free version at a low speed (few seeders) or would they be willing to pay for the higher/more consistent download speed?
Edit: Also, if you paid for the torrent then you could seed it yourself to earn money, creating another incentive to download the premium copy.

In terms of scale, this seems like a perfect use case for the lightning network proposal that was made recently.

Peter Todd's hub and spoke payment channel idea, or the recent the lightning network proposal (based on a similar scheme) both at least claim to offer a solution to the scaling problem using payment channels to allow thousands of transactions to occur off-chain for every few that appear on the block chain.

Maybe you could set it up so that seeders would have to sign the transaction with the private key they used to purchase the torrent?
