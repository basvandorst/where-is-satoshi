The world has been coming to and end since the day I was born, so don't worry too much. If there's a huge economy collapse of that magnitude the military will take the streets in a second and will confiscate whatever of value you have. No one will be prepared for that unless you have a lot of power and connections.

Why it's so hard to understand that your average joe needs a stable currency. He needs to know how much his mother will receive back home. Her mother needs to cash it easily. If Bitcoin cant solve that problem then it's basically the same as any other "altcoin", try to see beyond dogma and ideologies.
Anything else is speculation and moon kids trying to get rich thinking Bitcoin will go to one million dollars.

There are a lot of suspicious comments lately, especially with Kraken, perhaps one of the best exchanges in the business. I've used Wirex App two times without any problems whatsoever, it's a little confusing that you have to go to the older site (e-Coin) to use some features like selling, etc but other than that very fast and non-expensive service.

I'm not sure if Wirex App (formerly e-coin) is what you looking for but I've recently used it and it works great. You can get a virtual Visa card and load it up with Paypal, buy and sell BTC right in the app.

but why?

Sure, that's another discussion. Crypto is widely speculative in nature, we are just acquiring software licenses to use the network and speculating on how much usage it will have in the future, these are not currencies like many believe although they can be used as that.
To me ERC20 tokens are the killer apps as we've seen with recent ICO. Companies will start releasing their own, just to test the waters. I'm sure there would be a Santander Euro token and so on, or whatever they need to tokenize. Similar to Bitcoin colored coins.
I think that would be the start.

Keep repeating the same nonsense, ETH total supply is already priced in like BTC 21 millions, it will be around 100 million and it will take decades to even reach that. ETH needs to be used too just to create tokens, dapps and smart contracts.

So saying there's no cap means it will be have huge inflation? By the way, there is a cap, but the exact number is impossible to pin down today, Ethereum will move to POS, it's not Bitcoin. There's no "there will only be 21 millions" in the white paper.
It has been stated by the EF many times that total issuance would be around 100M, +-1 and this is after many decades of low inflation, it's just impossible to define before adjusting the exact POS parameters.
If for whatever crazy reason this changes and 100 million become 1 or 100 billion then the market will surely react accordingly.

I agree with some of your points but in the remote case that miners won't move to POS (the whole point of the project is to move to POS eventually) it will just fork and they can go mine that Ethereum Miners United coin. Just as you can now buy ETC for example. You will most likely miss all the EEA companies and ERC20 tokens/dapps though.

I meant the market already considers there would be around 100M ETH, not "infinite" supply like many here like to repeat. How much would be the fair price of a single ETH or total marketcap is anyone's guess.
