Lucky, how much BTC did you send if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:58:19
Thanks yeah, I tried it an hour ago, about to try momentarily again.

The fee system is so arcane, I don't know how they expect new people to slog through understanding anything that has so many moving parts.  
Here's how it needs to be so any average person can feel comfortable making a transaction.
1. Whatever these awesome SEGWIT and lightning things are I keep hearing about, everything needs to have it yesterday. Every wallet, every exchange, it has to be a mandatory standard.  It needs to happen on wallets without the end user having to do anything more than when they update an iPhone app. Click update, done. 
2. The fees need to be static. You should be able to select from a few different speeds for FIXED prices with the slowest taking no longer than 24 hours ever. 
3. "Network Congestion" needs to not even be a thing. No one gives a shit about lack of available block space etc etc. We're in a world where we can send money with a text message, BTC needs to be better.
4. Stuck Transactions? Is this a joke? How is this even happening. I am dealing with a stuck transaction from Dec. 17 that shows no signs of completing. That's just garbage technology. 
I just came back to Bitcoin after the huge bump and recovered some old coins, and I can't believe things are like this. If BTC is going to be next level we can't keep making excuses of why X isn't done yet or why Y isn't feasible. All that is do-able and needs to happen now.

I'm only into BTC part time, used my Breadwallet on iOS to send $200 or so in BTC to Binance on 12/16 using the "cheap" method and sent another $100 or so to Kraken using the "regular" method.
As of now BOTH transactions are still incomplete on 12/19!!! In the meantime I send some from Virwox to CEX and it took 24 hours. Breadwallet support blamed network congestion and unconfirmed coins -- but 48-72 hours? 
As someone who wants to get into crypto more, this is aggravating. I wanted to buy some alt coins but can't even get my coins to the exchange before price changes.

Thanks for finding that. I don't know why it says fee as 0. I chose the "cheaper" fee when sending it through Breadwallet but I can't imagine they would set the fee to 0??
What happens to a "dropped" transaction? I assume I will get the coins back but any idea when? It's kind of ridiculous that this can even happen.

I put the recommended fee from the Bitcoin Core wallet that said it would arrive within 8 hours. I don't know what I could have done better beyond that. 
There's no way for me to know that would turn out to be 100% false. I'm just looking for a solution for where I am now in this.

I am in the same boat. Transferring $2k+ at a fee of $86 (0.00577498 BTC) which my receiving wallet says is a "low fee" and has 0 confirmations after 7 hours. 
I mean, what could I have done better here? I paid way too much for what's supposed to be the future of transactions, I chose the 8 hour time window and paid the exact fee Bitcoin Core told me to. So far, 0 confirmations.
It has 1 hour to arrive on time, but I know it won't. I'm really souring on BTC honestly, this is not even close to acceptable. And I still have a 13 day old Bread Wallet transaction stuck too, thats a whole other thing!

Ah nice, I am looking to buy on the dip too but I'd be lying if I said these transaction issues weren't turning me off BTC a bit...I have Ripple, RaiBlocks, and some other alts which work so much easier.
I'm going to claim my BCC once this TX issue is solved and turn that into Bitcoin/alts.
That said, I would love to buy from an easy place like Coinbase (despite all the recent negativity toward them) but I'm in Hawaii, and none of the exchanges are allowed to do business with us or Wyoming apparently. Coinbase was forced to close my account earlier this year. 
I finally got verified at Bitstamp so I guess it's wire transfer fees for me if I want to buy more.

8 hour estimate generally should mean "8 hours, maybe 6 or 7 but maybe 9 or 10 if it's really busy" not "8 hours minimum or an indeterminable time period that could be days, weeks, or never."
I'm not going to wait til things clear, since there's literally no time frame that's reliable. Right now I'm trying to read about what will happen in a CPFP situation.

From my perspective as a hobbyist average bitcoin guy, I don't see why the number of inputs should matter at all for speed. I don't even know why we use the term inputs. It's just my accumulated Bitcoin from mining sent from those addresses. It doesn't take me longer to deposit $30 in a bank if I got $1 bills from 30 different people on 30 different days. It's aggravating that this is a factor slowing down my TX. 
Yeah one of those services wanted $1000 to speed it up!!

Thank you Joseph, I don't even think this has anything to do with Kraken though, it seems like it's just stuck in the network somehow still unconfirmed.

Please update when you get it sorted out, I'm interested in buying hash power with BTC there as well.
I want to use a CC but it's impossible from the US, which I don't understand. They could charge ab extra transaction fee, I wouldn't care. 
 If someone defrauds them with a CC order, they don't lose anything. They can just sell the hashpower to someone else, close the account, and keep the balance. Just institute a 14 day withdrawl lock until the CC payment clears. 
 Having to pay with BTC kinda sucks, Wire takes forever. But yeah, it seems definitely profitable at these prices, I'm interested.
