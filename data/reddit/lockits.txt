Can buy through LocalBitcoins.com through a bank, cash and in person.  I've used it many times with no problem.

It's not just about Bitcoin anymore as I'm learning.  It's about how we 'bank'. How we look at and use money, credit, debt...etc. Bitcoin has to be seen in perspective and when done so will become more integrated into the total of the above.  I recently started studying the Bitshares platform and have been profoundly impressed by Dan Larimer's presentations on Bitshares.  Bitshares adds depth to  understanding and application of the power of the blockchain, cryptocurrency, economics and how the Bitshare protocol can facilitate the use of Bitcoin to a level that I just wouldn't have been able to comprehend otherwise.  A real education.

I've used LocalBitcoins several time over the last two years.  Twice by meeting in person, 7 times through designated banks and 9 in cash mailings (only with ratings of (100%, 100%), and have had absolutely no problems.

Just my opinion but who says that the 'Dark Markets Go Down' is the NUMBER 1 story of the week.  I think the  story...Change Tip Users Spread Bitcoin All Over the Internet is by far the most interesting and pertinent story to the advance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  I suppose the  comes from the fear mongering dinosaur press.

Thanks for posting Economics explained.  I'm always surprised when people just don't get why centralized authority (government) destroys itself when it starts handing out the people's money. Will enjoy sharing this great story with those who don't want and really don't need to get into heavy theory.
