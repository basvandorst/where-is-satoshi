Where does he talk about bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the best monetary technology ever used by humans for scarcity, durability, verifiability, portability, and transferability. A money's value is not determined by its industrial manufacturing uses, its determined by these very specific monetary properties. 
You don't understand money and will pay dearly for it.

Wow. This was a really great post. Thanks for taking the time to craft this, I learned quite a bit!

You could say the same thing about the people who preached against the British govt and started the revolutionary war. They felt so intensely they killed people who disagreed. 
But it led to the creation of a constitutional democracy that has improved the lives of hundreds of millions. 
I think you’re right, but you’re thinking on the wrong scale. It is weird to evangelize about cashapp replacing Venmo, or some similar tech innovation. But it makes sense when it’s something as revolutionary as bitcoin supporters claim. Something that can prevent those in power from stealing from their subordinates and grant financial sovereignty like never before.

Cash app is pretty great. I think they will outcompete Coinbase for BTC. They have 1/10 the fees and allow immediate withdrawal.

I’ve found crypto twitter a really good way to sift through the bullshit. A well curated list of smart BTC minds is super helpful for an accurate pulse of the space.

Why would people hoard? Everyone has needs and will be forced to spend their money.

Seems like you’re making a catch 22. If it’s so great wouldn’t people be publicly talking about it? 
Infomercials are paid by a company, this is a user talking about it. Sure, he holds BTC but it’s still a lot different, he does not get paid by a central entity to take his time and do this. 
You’re imaging a revolutionary item that people don’t talk about the benefits of? ��

Just set up my node today! I’m having the same problem. Would love to know how to fix this as well.

It’s not about the PoW, the threat from quantum is about cracking private keys with Shor’s algorithm.

As soon as I see someone consider BCH, I instantly know they don’t understand bitcoin. 
It’s beautiful.

Great. Anything in the process of becoming a global reserve currency is going to be extremely volatile while getting there. But despite bull and bear markets, we are still on a great track of exponential growth.

I’ve learned my friend. Not afraid to admit I was TOTALLY wrong. I didn’t understand that the benefits of bitcoin come from its use as a store of value, not a payment network, on the base layer.
