You seem to know something about this, so I'm going to write how I think all this works, ignoring non-FED lending, in the hopes that you or someone else can correct me.
So pre-FED there are people/businesses/banks/the Treasury who have gold/silver backed currency.
* The treasury then issues a security.  
* That security is bought with backed currency by private entities.  
* The security expires.
* The FED pays the owners of the security back with money from the Treasury.
* The Treasury has insufficient funds, so rather than default on the loan, it prints money to cover the difference.
* This printed money is not covered by gold/silver backed currency.
* Rinse and repeat, but now with unbacked currency.
Now I see this meaning that there is an expansion of debt as any backed currency is finite, while the debt can accumulate well past that point.
You say in your post that 95% of currency is debt so if you repaid it there would be 5% left.  That makes no sense to me; if there is 95% debt and 5% currency, then aren't you short 90%?
Anyway as I understand it, the issue is simply at what point do the securities actually need to be paid off before more borrowing can occur.
Is that wrong at all?

Thanks for the reply!


As the central bank, doesn't the money come from the FED even if it's at the treasuries behest?  I may have misconceptions about what the role of the FED actually is, so feel free to rip me a new one.


From what I'm reading, They don't do it whenever is convenient, they only print when issuing a security. Is that right?


Once the securities had led to printing money that was no longer backed by gold isn't that the same thing?


So that 95% includes the money lent out by smaller banks twice? i.e. once in the bank account as a debt to the account holder and once in the actual currency given to the lendee?  That's the only way I seem to be able to parse what you wrote.  Also, I'm guessing this doesn't included debt from securities that are still being paid or yet to be paid?
Seriously though, thanks, this stuff is made overly complicated by everyone and it's hard, for me at least, to get a read on how it all actually works together.
