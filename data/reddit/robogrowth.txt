you know how I know bitcoin is going to work?  Because it's the bittorrent of money.  The RIAA has spent HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars fighting a futile battle against Bit Torrent.. and guess what, the protocol and technology is better today than it was 5 years ago.  We learn from our mistakes.. we learned napster sucked because the government could shut it down.  
That's how I know bitcoin will work.

Neither of those were open source nor did they have users with invested interest... huge difference.

I've been buying everytime i think the price looks good, every friday, and whenever I have some extra cash I wanna save.. I've bought at $13, $900 and everywhere in between.  I don't regret a single buy.  I have my oshit cash, I have a bunch of land, some physical gold/silver, some dividend paying stocks, and the rest buys bitcoin.
I've sold quite a bit over the years, and put myself in a better financial position by paying off all my debt with bitcoin, but i'm still buying.  Because I believe in the protocol to not only change money, but the way we use the internet and the world around us.  From voting, to healthcare records.. We need to decentralize.. Companies DO NOT need to be holding ANY data on their users.  Especially important data like financial and health records or votes.

I don't know if OT will make them obsolete, but his view on things in my opinion is not wrong.  I agree with him whole heartedly about appcoins and altcoins.  The beauty of open source is that any feature that is a "Bitcoin Killer" will be adopted by the bitcoin community.  
The Bitcoin 2.0 Apps would be MUCH better without their own coin.  The coin is pointless and just make adoption that much harder for the plebs.

the beautiful thing about bitcoin is it already has investment and adoption. It's open source, and we can hard fork.  Anything that's going to improove crypto can be added to Bitcoin.  People are going to continue to evolve the code.  The community accepts those changes and we go forward.  Bitcoin 2.0 will be some variation on the Bitcoin 1.0 Protocol.  Unless there is some way for bitcoin users to transfer wealth into whatever new crypto that comes out to compete with bitcoin, the most important factor of any crypto currency is adoption.
Bitcoin has a HUGE first mover advantage and a rabid fan base akin to the grateful dead.

there are plenty of ways to fund things without pre-mining.  That's the easiest sure but its not going to make your product better.  If your product was that good you'd have angels lining up to give you money.  There is billions being pumped into the bitcoin market and you're telling me the only way is to pre-mine?  Dead on arrival and no different than the 100 other scam coins out there created to enrich their creators.  
I get it, i have tons of projects I'd love to work on full time, but they aren't profitable so I can't.  What you have is a hobby and if you honestly think pre-mining is the way i feel sorry for the future of your product and the suckers who buy whatever you're trying to sale.. you'll get your premined coins you'll make a few dollars and when shit hits the fan the people that actually invested something will be left holding the bag.
I've yet to see a premined coin be worth its wait in salt let alone gold.  Premining is and always will be a get rich quick scheme for the developers.. End of Story.  Find another way if you want to work full time.
@_date: 2014-11-08 21:42:17

neither, the utility of the coins I have is the most important thing to me.. that'd be like asking early internet adopters, "what's more important your domain name or the price you paid for it.." sure domains are important, but they don't provide any utility.

.01% penetration is HUGE when you're talking about big numbers.. what's ridiculous is thinking that any scam coin that comes out with a feature so great it could crush bitcoin wouldn't be adopted by the bitcoin community.  The beauty of open source and community consent is that we can do whatever we want.  In this case the first mover has the biggest advantage.  It'd be like copy cat internets coming out and expecting them all to succeed.  "Oh this internet has this really cool feature."  Oh yea? well i'll just build it into THE internet. Instead of building new scam coins, build on top of bitcoin.. That's the way forward. 
Bitcoin only has value because the people perceive it to have value.  Scam coins have value because bitcoin has value and they're based on that.  But if you really think scam coin number 780 is going to overtake bitcoin then I have a bucket of paycoins i'll trade your for your bits.
