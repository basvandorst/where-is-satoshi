Are you going to sell your coins? Good luck!

Good idea. But one needs to have at least 2 trezors handy to make a transaction.
I can propose the following:
1. actually 24word seed is actually a big number. If you have seed, you can calculate number, and if you have number you can calculate the seed. So we need to save number.
2. We use Shamir's Secret Sharing [ to prepare 3 big numbers, any 2 of which can be used to create our bitcoin seed. you put those 3 seeds to different locations/people, and bingo \- you are safe.  
You only should remember the name/locations where you saved those seeds. And have one trezor  with pin to make transactions. If your trezor lost/broken/stolen \- just buy another. How to use Shamir's secret sharing you can easily find on internet for any language, Python, C, etc

I thought that 2G of mem is *quite* enough for node machine. I beware that this issue could be a bug. But I do not know how to fill bug report. And how to collect enough info for analysis.

I tend to agree. Actually it is Achill and the turtle paradox!
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:39:16
OK. Thanks to everyone.
I got the idea.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:01:13
But if one has no potential...
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:43:47
I have 0 swap memory:








Do I *really* need swap?
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:42:13
sorry 2GB.
Actually I have two different machines, odroid-c2 w/ 2G of mem and cubetruck two year old ARM computer with 2 G of mem. The second machine works OK.

Now I have the same issue. I will update bitcoin.conf with these values and update this thread tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:11:20
I meant that this SF should not be done instead of Segwt. Pls. read second paragraph of OP message.
Only my opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:32:12
No malleability, no quadratic hashing fix?
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:41:32
One day flight OK.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:44:46
I did a small calculation:
current hash rate is approx 4000000 Th/s
1 S9 produces 14Th/s
to have half of current hash rate one needs to have approx 142800 S9 machines.
Price for one machine is approx 2000 USD.
So one needs to pay approx. 285,714,285 USD
I would not play with such amount of money!
Did I missed something?
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:12:57


 
from 
Segwit prevents third-party and scriptSig malleability by allowing Bitcoin users to move the malleable parts of the transaction into the transaction witness, and segregating that witness so that changes to the witness does not affect calculation of the txid.
I.e. malleability fixed by segwit!

I thought that Bitmain will Develop Open Source Blockchain Security Software first 8)  /sarcasm
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:11:49


The meaning is: I vote for!
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:39:01


I agree. But lets imagine (theoretically), that all miners are are segwit2x, and all full nodes are Core nodes. What will happen? Who will pay all that money spent on equipment?
P.S. I should add that in worst case I will use my rasp pi as small home server.
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:18:11


Fully agree. I just see a lot of posts saying "full nodes are shit" and "there should be only miner nodes". And this is a reason for my posts.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:18:53
My understanding:
- if we pay 1 USD a year for electricity, then everybody can counterfeit bitcoin.
- if we pay 1000 USD a year, one needs to spend at least 1000 USD to counterfeit...
Now we pay 12.5 btc per 10 minutes + fees.
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:30:58


I think that everybody should provide his(her) opinion. My opinion is this: I want segwit. I will run core full node.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:29:45


Miners == central bank.
Full nodes == users.
Definitely I have no that amount of money to contradict the central bank. But they should know my intention not to use their money 
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:20:44
Thank you a lot. Time to read the documentation.
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:59:46


For me this means, that there should be *only* mining nodes. No way! I do not agree!
I believe that everyone should vote with his own full node. I call it "voting by my own feet". I believe that number of full nodes still means something.
Otherwise lets stop all full nodes except miners.
@_date: 2017-07-02 08:02:16
I see your point. But how a general user can vote? For example, I am a hodler, and invested a few dollars into bitcoin. I want segwit. There is no other way to vote, except running raspberry. Why should I run 20000 USD machine just to vote? Number of full nodes is proportional to *my* votes. Full nodes are active citizens!
IMHO, it should be very difficult to change rules, and very easy to contradict. because otherwise it would be very easy to buy votes!
I will repeat, IMHO!
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:00:13


Thank you very much for answering my stupid questions :), you are very kind.
May I ask one more question? Is there any way to count number of transactions, which come through my bitcoind daemon? Does bitcoind have any kind of statistics inside?
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:14:17


Agree that it is a little bit extreme.
Just a question: I still can not estimate how many full nodes enough. 10, 100, 1000...?
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:51:39
Then do it! I have right to run full node evenn on raspberry. And I will!
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:33:25
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:07:51
I believe than full node number is important. I  run 3. I just wonder how many is enough? Did someone run  simulation?
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:47:52
I thought that full nodes needed to control the network. For example, let assume we have only one full node. Then miners can fool the users. Lets take 2 full nodes, it become a little bit difficult.  Starting from which number it is (practically) impossible to fool the users?
I believe that full nodes are guards of consensus?
