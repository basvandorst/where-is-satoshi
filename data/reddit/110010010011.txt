Not debating your first sentence, but Coinmarketcap isn’t necessarily “true value.” It takes an average of all the exchanges across the world and weights them by trade volume. A couple weeks ago, the Korean exchanges were sometimes over $2k above everyone else. At the same time, their trade volume was enormous. This inflated the price on Coinmarketcap to be even higher than the GDAX price for days, often by nearly $500. This would not have been “true value” for any westerner because it is extremely difficult to arbitrage money in and out of Korea and get those inflated prices. 
Even today, the Korean exchanges are trading at $19,500 USD, but their trade volumes aren’t as dominate as a couple weeks ago, so the spread between Coinmarketcap and GDAX is thin at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:58:58
For reference, I remember the $10k wall on GDAX was worth about $12M. At the moment, the $20k wall on GDAX is worth $44M. This could take a few days to buy up.

The real trick is figuring out where to hide the 24 word phrase, because unlike the Nano S, that is as good as cash if discovered.
A passphrase wallet, which effectively adds a 25th secret word is probably the best route, unless you have a really great safe in your home.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:41:14
Yeah. It's an eight-sided strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:09:38
Sort of.
You can only deduct capital losses from capital gains. You can not deduct it from your ordinary income.
You can forward capital losses on to future years if your net capital losses for the year exceed $3000.
However, each future year, you can only deduct $3000 of those losses until your forwarded losses are depleted.

They can’t know without questioning you, but if you are claiming the coins are no longer yours, that means you’ve sold, which is a taxable event. If you are claiming you still have them, an auditor will probably ask you to prove it. 
Most likely, though, they are going to go after you based on information they grabbed from exchanges, where it is obvious that you have bought and sold. You probably can’t hide your activity from the IRS if you are using an exchange that forces you to ID yourself in order to use it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:18
Seems like an equal amount of people think it could be good as it could be bad. No one knows. It will certainly bring in more money, but the risk is it will increase the short side of the money. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:00:41
Capital losses must also be reported, and it serves you to do so, because they can be deducted from your gains allowing you to pay less tax. The fact that you used leverage or not is irrelevant. You either made money, or you didn’t, and the IRS wants to know in both scenarios. 
Also, it’s moving USD where they get you, not moving BTC. They will know where your USD came from and where it went if they have information from the exchange. It’s the conversion to and from USD that the IRS is most concerned with because it describes your cost basis and your capital gain or loss.

If you look at the details, BTC is breaking $13k on coinmarketcap because the Korean markets are trading at high volume over $14,500. They're moving the average up for everyone, despite the American/European markets having yet to break $13,000.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:46:43
I’m treating my fork coins as a $0 cost basis. So if the coin is worth $100 and I sell it, I pay capital gains on the full $100. 
Some people are treating the value of the coin the day they received them as income, which you pay tax on. If you receive a $25 fork coin, you pay income tax on the $25. When you sell it for $100, you pay capital gains on the $75 difference. 
I’m not sure how to report your method on the IRS forms. It’s similar to when a stock splits into two different tickers like when GOOG split into GOOG and GOOGL, so there probably is a way. The only advantage your method has (which is admittedly a big one), is that you don’t have to hold the fork coins a full year to get long term capital gains. You only have to hold a year from which the underlying BTC was purchased. Other than that, it’s basically the same as the way I’m treating the forks. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:58:50
The trader can make money on volatility, yes, but the volatility needs to be a strong swing upwards in a short period of time, like what we saw this month. I probably wouldn’t call it a “delta hedge” since the trader would lose significant amounts of money if the price swung downwards. It is still a bet that bitcoin will go up, just not necessarily a bet that Bitcoin will be over $50k by next December. The trader may be looking for another upwards swing like we saw to $19k, and would exit the trade with profit after the swing (instead of waiting until Dec hoping BTC is over $54k by then).

Not OP, and I don’t have a recommended link, but it’s pretty simple. 
For example, right now, for $142 million, you can raise the price on the GDAX exchange to $20k (you’d be buying every bitcoin for sale up to $20k). That’s a $3k rise in price, which would rise the market cap of Bitcoin by $54 billion. 
Granted, this is an extreme example, since I’m only talking one exchange, but it would certainly be possible to move the market cap of bitcoin by $50 Billion without putting anywhere near $50B into the network.

Your wallet is safe with Coinbase. Use the Google Authenticator option to log in and it is practically impossible for someone to hack your account. 
But most people don't like keeping their bitcoin in Coinbase, because Coinbase holds the keys to your bitcoin. Whoever controls the keys, controls the money. Consider moving the bitcoin to a hardware wallet once you have enough bitcoin to justifying purchasing a $100 device to protect it.
The price of bitcoin, like anything else, is affected by supply and demand. If the world wants bitcoin, the price goes up, if the world doesn't want it, the price goes down. There are, of course, external factors that affect whether or not people want it. One example would be government intervention. China cracked down on bitcoin usage this year, causing a temporary drop in the value of bitcoin as many Chinese sold off their holdings.

The only way, that I know of, to get bitcoin exposure in a 401k, is to purchase GBTC. It's a trust that holds ~171,000 BTC, and you can purchase shares that are worth 0.092% of each bitcoin in their trust, over the counter.
Unfortunately, since this is the only bitcoin vehicle with a stock ticker currently available, the spread between the value of GBTC and the value of BTC is enormous. Today's $1,769 price of GBTC means each bitcoin in their trust is worth over $19,000, while, in reality BTC trades at $11,000 today. So you're paying a 72% premium on bitcoin when you purchase GBTC.
Any other method currently requires you to withdraw the 401k funds, pay the penalties, and make traditional taxable investments in bitcoin.
*Edit: forgot to mention that you need to rollover the account into an IRA, since I'm guessing you can't purchase whichever ticker you want with her 401k.

Off-site backups.


If it's a hardware wallet, it's worthless to whoever stole it without the pin to access the device. If it's a recovery phrase, it's worthless attached to a memorized passphrase.

@_date: 2017-12-04 18:54:33
Sort of.
The penalty for cashing out is real, guaranteed, and irreversible.
The penalty for purchasing GBTC at its current premium may never materialize. If the spread between GBTC and BTC never closes, you technically don't pay a "penalty" for purchasing GBTC instead of BTC.
Probably the only thing that will allow for the spread to close is the US legalization of a bitcoin ETF. Money will then flow into the ETF instead of GBTC because the ETF will be coupled to the price of bitcoin.
You certainly could still make a ton of money off of GBTC, as many have this year, as long as the price of BTC keeps rising and the Bitcoin ETF keeps getting pushed back.

In my mid-30’s and if the next six months are as good as the last, I’ll never have to work again either — and that’s off of a quite minor investment (5% of my NW) made in early 2015. I imagine there are quite a few people who made off way better than I did around here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:51:38


That's exactly how it works. I would just have your family remember the passphrase. My wife has it in a password storage app, which is, of course, isolated from my recovery word list, which is written down and in a safe that she knows the location of.
In my will (which I'm having written soon), I will put directions to find my 24 word list. I'm using [this app]( to create a printout of my passphrase that will only be visible when two sheets of paper are combined and held up to light. One sheet will stay with the word list. One sheet will stay with the will.
That protects my crypto from theft (someone would need a copy of the will from my lawyer, and access to my safe to steal it), and simultaneously allows my family to inherit it if both my wife and I are gone.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:11
We don’t know if it will burst, but breaking $10k brought in a boatload of new money all ready to make a quick buck. At the slightest hint of a crash, at lot of those people might unwind their position quicker than the panic-bought into it. So my guess is that a crash would take us back below $10k (-35% from the levels we are seeing right now). 
But none of us can predict the future, so perhaps nothing will happen. This is all unprecedented.

Because the fact that the Koreans are paying way more for bitcoin than just about everyone else doesn't matter much to everyone else. If you are an American, it's easiest to sell on an American exchange, so the American USD/BTC exchange rates are the most important.

And the person selling the option is taking on considerably more risk. The buyer is risking a million dollars. But the seller could lose way more than a million. Bitcoin doesn't even have to come anywhere near $50k for the seller to panic cover his position for a million dollar + loss.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:52:50
It’s still a $1M bet, because that is how much the trader paid to enter it, but the payoff varies significantly depending on the outcome. 
If by December 2018, Bitcoin is at:
- $50k or less, the option is worth $0
- $53,600, the option is worth $1M (what the trader paid for it)
-  More than $53,600, the option is profitable. 
The value of the option will also vary over time depending on bitcoin’s price action. For example, today, it is probably worth less than $1M and the trader is currently negative. 
If Bitcoin goes to $30k next month, the trader could be up more than a million dollars. The trader may not hold until December 2018, and may choose to cut his losses or lock in his profit before then by selling the options to someone else.

If it’s a temporary pullback, I don’t think it can rightfully be called a bubble bursting. The 2013 crash is now almost barely a bubble burst in hindsight. The early 2000’s dotcom crash, that many companies never recovered from, however, is a good example of a definite bubble bursting. 
I understand that many people have differing definitions of a “bubble,” but it seems silly to call a 50% crash a “bubble burst,” if the equity is double the pre-crash value a year later.

This is why Tesla is selling direct.

When Tesla starts selling directly to your country, companies like that will probably go away, because they will be unnecessary.

I think this is the most accurate data you’ll find. 
It’s pulled from 85,000+ BTC holders’ self-reported holdings. It’s probably a bit biased towards richer bitcoiners, since the website is most useful for tracking capital gains, but it’s a large sample size. 
Pulling stats from bitcoin addresses is highly misleading because:
1. Most people have more than one BTC address. 
2. Many large BTC addresses are held by exchanges, so it’s technically not even their money. 
3. Many BTC addresses have lost keys, so technically no one has that money anymore.

The Ledger Nano S supports passphrase. You literally type it out with the two buttons on the device. Clunky, but you only have to do it for the initial setup or recovery

Good news, however, is it was a demo account, as proven by the account number he accidentally exposes during the live stream.

Well, it gives you something, and that is how insignificant $24M is when it comes to moving the price of a security with $10B in volume per day.
If I claimed someone printed $2 and moved the price of bitcoin with it, you'd think I was an idiot. Same goes for $20, $200, 2,000, etc. Eventually the number matters, because again, *volume is important* when discussing these things. However, you still don't cross that threshold at $24M. Still insignificant.

The only people this affects are:
The people who lost the keys - negatively
The people who still have their keys - positively

[Yes.]( What's your point?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:50


It's meaningless when you want it to be in an attempt to prove a point. But in the real world, it has a measurable effect on markets. If volume was meaningless, Jeff Bezos could sell all his Amazon shares this afternoon and have a $100B cash. If volume was meaningless, short squeezes couldn't happen. If volume was meaningless, panic buying wouldn't increase the price. 
Pro-tip: Volume *isn't* meaningless.

I invest in stock so that I have something left if BTC crashes. I invest in BTC so that I have something left if the stock market crashes. The two positions will, hopefully, hedge each other out so that I'm not in the poor house if something goes wrong with either.

No. It’s a 24 word list that generates your wallet addresses and keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:15
Rotating in and out of a position hundreds of times isn't going to move the market. You have to apply constant pressure in one direction over the time period you want to have an effect. Buying and selling $25M in BTC throughout the day is going to have little effect because the pressure from your sales are going to cancel the pressure from your purchases.

The passphrase is entered on the device, not the computer. It never reaches the computer. Neither does your recovery seed. A key logger can't catch any of this unless it is installed on your hardware wallet.
The seed you store is useless to a thief, like I just said, if you are using a passphrase wallet. It does not contain your private key if your BTC is hidden behind a passphrase.

For the past few years Tesla has only attended the Paris Auto Show. So, unless you’re French, you saw a privately owned vehicle, not an official Tesla display. Tesla lets people crawl all over their vehicles at their brick and mortar locations.

Time to learn about passphrases my friend. Your recovery seed is worthless if you are using a passphrase wallet. The recovery process is encrypted by your custom passphrase, which you memorize, just like you memorized the password to your encrypted hard drive. If you recover the wallet using only the recovery seed, it will be empty.
And no one can access your BTC if they steal your hardware wallet. The Nano S erases the device after 3 incorrect PIN entries. Good luck guessing an 8 digit number in 3 tries.

Your keys are exposed to your computer every time you decrypt them. Also, hard drives fail. 
A hardware wallet seems far superior to your method. Memorize your passphrase and write down your recovery key and store that in multiple places. Your wallet is still encrypted with your passphrase, your keys aren't ever exposed, and you don't have to worry about the one in 10,000 chance of all your hard drives failing simultaneously.

Bought a house in 2012. Put 0% down (VA Loan at 3.6%).  Invested the capital I had that would have covered 25% of the value of the home.

Mine knew we had BTC before they became valuable. She just didn’t know or care how much. It got to the point where it was the unavoidable elephant in our portfolio, though. 
I don’t think she knows exactly how much we have since it’s inconsequential to her, but she does know about how much it’s worth.

We have an agreement to discuss all purchases over $100.  This can be any number, but $100 works for us. 
So - car, yes. house, yes. bathroom, no. 
Helps minimize the “why did you spend that much money on that??” arguments. Also, helps keep both of us from blowing money on stupid things.

I update my wife quarterly on our financial holdings. Bitcoin became a big part of them during the run last year, so I filled her in once it became a significant amount. 
I have a few reasons why:
1. We have kids, so it’s in my interest that the money doesn’t go to the grave with me, or both of us. She needs to know about it, if the holdings are to get to them. 
2. Marriage is about trust and transparency. I know she could run with the money. I know she will get half if in a divorce. But if I don’t trust her to not take our money, I also shouldn’t trust her to be my wife or care for my children. 
3. I can’t buy a new Tesla when my wife thinks our net worth is half of what it actually is ;)

I’ve only ever owned one stock that has paid me dividends, AAPL, and I’ve been invested in the stock market since 2005. That dividend didn’t even appear until 2012 after going away for 16 years. 
NFLX and TSLA for example, have never paid me a dividend. A ton of professional investors own both.

A strict interpretation of the IRS code says neither gets the tax credit. The car was purchased with the intent to resell, which disqualifies the original buyer. The tax credit can’t be passed on to the second buyer. 
A loose interpretation says the original buyer gets it (but he better pray his auditor agrees with said interpretation).

Lets say you already have a million dollars in your stock trading account. You'd like to move a quarter million of that into Bitcoin.
You currently have to wire that $250k to a bank account and wait for it to clear. You then have to wire that $250k to an exchange and wait for it to clear. Then you can buy your BTC. But you're still not done. You have to purchase a hardware wallet, figure out how to use it without losing all your money, and then move the BTC to said wallet. That's a lot of money jumping through a lot of hoops. Most people aren't comfortable enough with this process to even bother.
If there was an ETF, you would purchase $250k of the ETF in your trading account.

Not a true ETF. GBTC holds a fixed number of Bitcoin and you buy an (often overpriced) share of that Bitcoin. Buying GBTC doesn't affect the price of Bitcoin because they are not required to buy actual Bitcoin to grow their holdings. An ETF would be forced to buy more Bitcoin if people kept buying the ETF.

Liquidating short positions are just as easily the result of a strong move as they are the cause of one. The initial move could be caused by "manipulation," which then causes shorts to panic and compound the move. 
Same thing with panic sellers during a downturn. Did the panic sellers cause the downturn, or did the downturn cause the panic sellers?
