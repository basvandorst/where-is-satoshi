Maybe they could put each donated coin in a new wallet and have people "donate" for erowid sanctioned wallets, then claim the money exchanged as another tax deduction.
That's how the tax system works, isn't it?

More like, neither does a chairman of a gated community who fires a community bullet within the community with the endorsement of the community.

Look at the pictures again.
There are two little singles, but only one has the power connected, so that's 179W for 25Gh/s.

Since when did overwhelming demand represent the death of any market?
If anything, it suggests that the owners should be applying certain market principles, like raising the price.

Remember the guy who had his two little singles "delivered"?
He left them at BFL.
Perhaps he has some sort of agreement with them where they sit there, mining.
That way, BFL gets to see real testing, while not technically profiting from it.

Last week's tremendous panic only brought the price down to $50, and it caused a large increase in positive press coverage.
It's highly unlikely that we'll see prices below $50 again.

Clearly, the price of platinum crashed in January 09 because bitcoin was introduced.

If enough people hold, the price won't tank.
We're holding out both for the sake of bitcoin and for higher prices.
You're a cheapskate amateur trader, holding out for a crash so you can profit off the chaos.
Fuck you.

It's also impossible for every single individual in the world to profit simultaneously.
What's your point?

Josh stated that even though the power consumption will be higher than promised, it would be much more energy efficient than the Avalon ASIC.
I don't see how 7.2W/gh is *much* more efficient than 9.3W/gh...

Any changes in the price wouldn't really be a result of an increase in mining power; they'd be a result of what the most powerful miners choose to do with their coins.
i.e. if large piles of coins are suddenly sold off, the price drops.

The computer industry was fine until the internet, P2P file sharing and iPods became mainstream. Then there was a resurgence in home laptop sales, as "social media" like Youtube, Myspace etc... came to prominence, until the iPhone came out.
In conclusion, Apple both started and ended the computer industry.

Perhaps some convoluted scenario runs through organizations heads, like "If people buy bitcoins to donate to us, but the value goes down before they can donate them, we're technically responsible for their loss of money!"

You have to remember that BFL started not so long ago as a team of computer engineers and programmers, who designed, programmed and sold a bunch of FPGA machines.
They've had to acquire investors, new employees, new contacts, etc, etc...
Their PR kinda sucks, but I truly believe they're just trying to navigate through a frontier that is new to them.

Coin sellers probably buy in bulk, and profit heavily off increases.

The 2011 crash from $33 to ~$2.50 looks exactly the same.
People who bought at the "bubble" price of $33 could sell today, and still make money.

Yeah, everyone start daytrading. 
Surely there is less risk involved!
@_date: 2013-03-07 10:26:02
I bought a bunch of coins last year.
I highly doubt the price will drop to that level again, so small drops like this one are the perfect time to **buy**.

The usual. Large numbers of people cash out, then larger numbers of people slowly buy up.

The queue only represents potential buyers; it isn't there because people are buying, it's there because Mt. Gox is slow.
If so many people are waiting to buy bitcoins at market prices, imagine how many are simply buying them from elsewhere, for more than the market price.

In a free market, businesses are free to self-regulate as much as they like.
Nobody is asking for a law to regulate minimum trades, customers are merely suggesting how to improve the service.
You know what really restricts a free market?
Cartels and monopolies.

Refuse to give him the coins, and ask him if going to jail is worth getting nothing.
But not really. Better to just not advertise that you own an address full of coins.
