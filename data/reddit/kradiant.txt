If you get scammed or hacked it won't be yours either.

My admittedly mediocre experience with chart anaylsis is that TA can tell you 'when' something is likely to happen, but usually not 'what'. Price bounces between significant levels in any asset class, and fib levels always attract a lot of attention so that's where the big moves often happen. I was pretty sure we were going to see some retracement here but whether it's red again tomorrow or all the way back up to 14k, I haven't got a clue.

Bounced off the 61.8 - just buyers stepping in again/short sellers getting out, at a structured price.

Aaaand it's over $10k.

I mean, it's not that bad for a layperson's understanding of crypto I would say. Apart from the drugs and syringes bit, and confusing digging with mining, the general gist of it is there. If this was the average old person's understanding of crypto we would be in a very good place indeed.

I made about $350 off the $15 of Doge I  bought in 2014 when I sold last year. Had completely forgotten about it and missed the peak, though it was still nuts for a meme coin. I'm sure some people have done very well out of it.

In terms of the relative size of the move it's more or less spot on.

There is a small team active on development. They post updates to 
I think at the moment the focus is on fully releasing 1.14, then the doge-ethereum bridge, while simultaneously working on a non-release 1.15 to pave the way to 1.16.

There was no need for the example really - just look at any number of other failed cryptos which are currently being 'hoarded'. A large number of people holding onto something does not make it valuable in and of itself. Without an equal or even greater quanitity in demand, prices will simply stagnate, as they have done for the last 6 months.

Not quite the same thing - they weren't claiming the price would not drop any lower.

You'll probably have to spend the first 30-45 seconds convincing yourself its actually you.

Even at $1 per coin that's a really dumb thing to do.

Lol what? That possiblity of that pattern playing out was broken around $6500. You don't get to keep raising the rim of the 'cup' when it doesn't match up with the previous data - it describes a very specific set of psychological events in the market.

All I can think is that it's counting invididual log-ins, which is essentially meaningless.
