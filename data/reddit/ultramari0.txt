Not necessarily, I had this problem with Cardano (ada) the withdrawal was disabled do to wallet maintance for days and it skyrocketed in price while in exchange. Forcing me to leave a very large sum exactly were I didn't want, but this how people become good investors... Bye losing money, trust me this person will never make that mistake again. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:34:42
Nope the other person refused to ante up that much 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:33:41
I lost over 1000 BTC in mtgox that's how I learned not to trust exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:49:23
This is why we need a decentralized exchange, I don't care what project wins like 0x, ect...

I don't remember the first place I learned about it but it was used to gamble online on this professional video game website I used to use. I just thought it was like Mario 64 gold coins, it wasn't until I " placed" a very large bet on myself to win against my opponent, when he freaked out and told me how much I was betting and it was " real money". This was several years ago.

@_date: 2017-08-23 09:09:51
I agree with you, that's why I'm not going to use it again. I was just explaining why I did. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:21:22
To use Peters exact argument against gold.whats to stop humans from finding something else that replaces gold and is even rarer, nobody gonna want gold there all going to want that. Thus gold has no value other than what people place on it.. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:13:59
Technically in this picture it's 1 Bitcoin = 5 ounces of gold.

The only reason I used tether is when eth went to 400$ and I locked in at that price and bought back in at under 200$.it I switched to any other coin at that point I would have lost money. Instead I doubled it. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:04:01
I did and put my money on it , same as eth , I knew at less than a dollar it would be 1k per coin .this year will also be fantastic ...30k BTC 3k eth .
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:17:13
Yep I just got told this
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:03:47

@_date: 2018-06-03 00:23:16

That obviously wasn't working out , which left the original two choices 
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:31:07
Just make a Faraday cage or using a hardware wallet you can buy a new one ( after fall out) and add your 24 word seed to put your ETH back in. My nano S is always in my shark wallet.

I would have put up with being homeless for a few years, so I could have millions later but you made your choice.
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:54:43
And here I was thinking 1 satoshi = 1 dollar 
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:06:53
Or it can save you thousands on Bill's while your crypto currency keeps getting stronger.
