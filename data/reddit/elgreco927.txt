Your comment just reminded me of that scene from Bronx Tale, that's all.

If you're asking why I am using Coinbase, it is because they enabled me to get the buttons on the web page very quickly (no development effort), along with capturing the user's email and physical address for fund raiser orders.  The bitcoin can be transferred to another wallet to minimize someone else holding our coins.  Do you have any other suggestions of how I should have done it?

You just made me realize I should set up my non-profit's web page to accept bitcoin donations!  Will look into that, thanks!

Thanks for the link, I'll check it out!

Exactly, it's the collecting of certain info that would be tied to the transaction that I'm gaining from using Coinbase.

Sorry if my wording was unclear.  In this case, we are selling physical tickets for an event and need contact info / address to deliver them.  I totally agree in making things as easy as possible.

Thank you!

How are you limiting your max # of connections?  I just spun up a full node on my machine today, after a couple of months of learning about Bitcoin.  I'm using the Bitcoin Core Client.

Maybe I should save this question for a "Moronic Monday" post, but can you ELI5?  
I've been learning about bitcoin recently, and am really impressed with blockchain technology and the potential for new applications and services it could support.  
Is it nonsensical to have a blockchain without bitcoin?  My first impression is that you need some unit of value to reward the miners and nodes, otherwise you won't have a network of devices, which means you won't have a blockchain.  Is that the gist of it?
