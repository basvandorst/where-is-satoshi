Yea.. but also if you say 'no' then some credit card issuers will charge you a 'foreign currency transaction fee' in addition to a 2.5% fx loss.. so basically it's a scam whether you answer yes or no.. 
which actually works out costing you less probably varies depending on the terms of your card.

The private key is just a really big random number.. you can generate as many of them as you want.
Your wallet software listens to the p2p network which broadcasts all transactions (even those not interesting to you) and copies all transactions relating to your keys into your wallet file.

Building permits and planning permission are hardly unique to France.

Yep, but that isn't really the problem with it.. 
The problem is that paypal, bank transfers and probably most methods of payment that people would want to use don't really have any time limit on when the scammer can issue a chargeback.. certainly not anything reasonable like a week.. 
so basically you will do the transaction, get paid, release the escrow and think everything went well.. and then get nailed with the chargeback. It might work with ridiculously long escrow periods of more than a year, but I don't think that will be attractive to anyone.
It's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.. generally BTC sellers have more reputation than buyers so it isn't a problem for buyers to send the fiat first and then get paid their BTC after the seller confirrms the bank transfer. If it were a problem then maybe this would be the solution, but it isn't. 
The problem is fraudulent buyers chargeing back the money after the sale is complete.. which this just doesn't help with.

frankly, no. automation and centralization are a natural feedback loop that will increasingly cut humans out of the economy.. we will have to find other things to do with our time.

they should make a parallel port version so you can use it with an old dot matrix :)
