well in that case you better keep at spending it. I don't see the point of holding for the sake of "holding", it's not as if Bitcoin can only work if it reaches 100k, it works now and it's up to those who have an interest in crypto's success to decide its future: usable technological currency or a simple commodity.

so what was up with people buying at 1,000 and selling at 10,000 ?

I don't know squat about crypto. What I know is, you're not **holding** for the love of crypto, you're holding to increase your profit. If y'all really cared about "the world has never seen something like this", "I can't part" should be the last thing on your list, and instead you'd be focusing at finding new ways of parting with &amp; using bitcoin as currency in the real world.

what, lobbying ?

well I don't know about bitcoin, but I understand politics and I don't agree with you here. We went trough prohibition, we're going trough the war-on-drugs, we invaded Irak for their "nuclear arsenal"...It won't be hard to scare population into believing terrorism is funded with bitcoin and justify a ban if that's what they wanted.


You are surely aware the topic at hand *is* Wall Street though, right ?

congratulations on your hundreds of billions $ and thousands of politicians in your pocket then.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:56:57
I honestly don't. What would happen if Wallstreet buys policy to regulate restrict or outright ban buying &amp; selling bitcoin ? Or what happens if they simply throw a few hundred billions at it ?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:06:48
Until Wall Street starts controlling Bitcoin...

whichever way they can, they have the capital to influence where things go.

TIL Bitcoin is illegal in South Korea.
