ever wonder how bitcoin futures somehow predict the price every single week with extreme accuracy? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:19:52
So I pay for my chicken tendies, and wait in store for 2 hours for it to confirm?

How can the crypto bubble be over after a measly 800billion? That would make it one of the smallest bubbles in history. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:39:29
No it’s being pumped unsustainably at the moment.

There are no posts specifically relating to central banks influencing markets. But whatever.

But it’s true, it’s infinitely divisible. The price of bitcoin changes as you acquire a larger share of the pie but the supply of bitcoin is infinite due to the decimal system. Just because an infinite amount of decimal places is meaningless to you due to value doesn’t mean it’s not infinite.

No it’s not a conspiracy that member banks hold stock in the federal reserve and other central banks. It was never a conspiracy. These member banks have voting power to approve accounts set up by policy makers. The end game is profit, people don’t just do things for free.

weeds already expensive as it is, can they not accept something with cheaper transaction costs like bitcoin cash?

CME group have stated they do not want investors shorting bitcoin initially. 
Traditional financial Investors/traders are facing a systemic issue at the moment; Low volatility, high risk and low yield. 
These investors are hungry for high risk to rewards, and they’re not going to destroy the only market in the world that can currently give that to them. 
It’s a particularly risky task to short the biggest bull market in the history of bull markets. They’re going to want to ride this speculative wave as much as the rest of us.

Tulips can’t be endlessly grown, but okay. Also bitcoin is finite only because of a limitation in our perception of it. Even though the total supply of coins is maxed at 21 million, you can still buy fractions of it down to very long strung-out decimal places. These decimal places are infinite. Therefore the supply of bitcoin is infinite.

Don’t it’s to expensive

Bitcoin and the crypto market could easily crash due to supply and demand, just like the Atari and Dotcom crash. It doesn’t necessarily need a specific catalyst. 
When there is a surplus of more viable alternatives that have better utility than bitcoin. Along with the fact that price does not reflect adoption, it reflects speculative interest. 
The only reason people are investing in bitcoin is because they expect the price to continue going up. But what happens if the price retraces a little further than anticipated? Expectations vs reality can cause reflexivity in the market, and this could easily induce a panic sell off. 
Coupled with the fact that more and more inexperienced investors are jumping on the bandwagon everyday. This is the perfect recipe for an increasingly volatile and unstable market. People are taking out mortgages and gaining access to leverage to buy bitcoin, which increases risk and irrational exuberance. 
Looking at the BTC chart on trading view right now, it looks strikingly similar to the denial/return to normal  bull trap that seems to be a recurring pattern in most financial crashes. 
I’ve closed all my positions, and I’m happy to jump back in after BTC reaches another ATH and retraces towards SMAs.

hey that would give them a good excuse to completely ban cryptocurrency

I fully agree that their bubble is way worse then our bubble, due to the fact that all of society is dependent on it for survival. 
But there is no denying that bitcoin is in a bubble. It’s utility as a concept is revolutionary, but that utility is ineffective compared to other competing alternatives. 
The market is saturated, there is a huge surplus of other products that offer way more utility. The whole purpose is to transact, yet no one is adopting it due to transfer costs and confirmation times. 
The only reason the prices are going up is due to speculation, but that will also drive the prices downwards. After the bubble pops and the dust settles there will be a victor that rises from the ashes. This is simple Darwinism at play.

I’m so hard right now

@_date: 2017-12-04 04:01:23
Bitcoin is the MySpace of social media. It’s a revolutionary concept but there are so many better alternatives.

i should have posted this in a less regressive subreddit
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:11:03
The FED is tappering it's asset purchasing program by June 2018, less QE + higher interest rates = every mother fucker on leverage pulling their investment out of bitcoin like Jenga

MarxCoin, it has an infinite supply and you can use it to purchase a limited supply of food and water

central banks can do whatever they like with the vast amount of money they print, they have never been audited before so how on earth would you know? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:43:15
Stocks is just fake papers, no transparency, slow as hell. Controlled by corrupt centralised institutions. They’re dumb and antiquated. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:45
Whoops thanks

volatility is a natural part of free market economics. 
A big issue in the financial system today is complacency, fuelled by low volatility. It’s fundamentally driven by central banking stimulus and low interest rates.
it’s pushing the world into a denialism of the fundamentals that should realistically drive the economy. Until of course we hit a boiling point that melts the entire frame work and causes a huge financial collapse, like the one we had in 2008. 
Volatility should not be feared, it helps us to acknowledge an issue at hand and deal with it as quickly as possible. 
Not allowing volatility is the equivalent of  shoving junk into cupboards and under the mattress until inevitably It all pours out are we are forced to deal with an even more gigantic and catastrophic problem. 
Those problems can range from insolvency of banks, to freezing of credit, and ultimately starvation and famine.

The whole financial market is about to crash, don’t take it personally 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:46:51
Yes they’re apart of on old system, that doesn’t work. Blockchain solves all the problems they are facing. They will crash, and will be worthless one day. While cryptos become the new system to replace it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:03:22
It’s actually the smallest bubble in history but okay

If you don’t see how this technology could replace a piece of paper then you clearly don’t understand the scope and significance distributed technology

Firstly what is the point of reporting when you can have the public verify everything on a public ledger? 
Secondly the GAAP have a tonne of conflicts of interests, they’re a corrupt institution. Theyre just another example why we need decentralisation. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:24:08
Well the significant accounting differences between the GAAP and the IFRS certainly disagree with you 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:45:45
If you think cryptos are just “internet money” you fundamentally misunderstand the entire design and mechanism of a distributed ledger.
