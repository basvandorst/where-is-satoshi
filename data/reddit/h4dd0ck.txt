Don't trust anyone to hold your bitcoins unless you have specific reasons, you should always be able to control your bitcoins. A multisig wallet is highly recommended. I like Copay or Electrum and also the bitcoin hardware wallet are reliable too.
Find a platform to acquire bitcoins which is offering a good privacy (juridictions like Switzerland and Luxembourg have a strong privacy law) , good support and fast service.

Every company has his own internal processes to apply AML/KYC regulations. Regarding the country and the juridiction, the guidelines can be different. To avoid fraud, companies are setting up different schemas to protect themselves and also customers whom may have their identities stolen. Indeed, common fraud schemes are evolving with bitcoin and increase the difficulty of knowing who is behind a transaction. 
It's all about the trust you are able to build between you and the platform you use. You need to be sure it's a trusted and respectable company behind the platform and there are not exploiting your datas for any another purpose. On their side, they need to confirm you are the person you pretend to be.  
The terms &amp; conditions and also the commercial registry can tell you about the company in general.
My advice -&gt; Choose a platform in a trustable juridiction with a strong privacy law enforcement like Switzerland or Luxembourg.

* 1- In my opinion, the bitcoin wallet [Copay]( is good, it's my everyday wallet because it's easy, it works on every platform, and offers a multi-sig option (a better layer of security). Follow the instruction to setup, you will be forced to back up (which is good thing !). It takes max 5min
* 2- To avoid complexity, I recommend [Bity.com]( the swiss guys have done a good job. 
My friends who started in Bitcoin have used it from their first try and they are still using Bity cause it's straightforward.
You can order your first bitcoins (up to 250 CHF/€/USD) by verifying your mobile and your email address only.
So open an account, verify your email, insert your bitcoin address (the one provided by your Copay wallet) and your mobile number to secure your account. (use Bity with Google Chrome or Firefox because you can scan the QR-Code of your bitcoin wallet Copay via your computer camera)
Follow the instructions to buy, then select bank transfer, go to your e-banking and make the transaction related to your order and ... voila !
It takes max 10min from the account creation to the order.
You will receive your bitcoins on your copay wallet once the payment will be received by the platform ;-)

Thank you so much for the MEGA link ! 
It would be great to hear about BBVA why they have removed it as it used to be public ? I was highlighting how BBVA is moving in the good way by presenting the video .. it was a big fail, the link was not working any more ... I felt lonely during few seconds front of my audience ... Probably, they don't want to be the first movers front of the others banks. All banks are all looking to each other to see who will go in first ... It was exactly the same schema with the MP3 and the major music companies ... Everybody in the financial sector know it will disrupt the banking industry by providing a commun financial tool for the entire world. it's just a question a time adoption....
