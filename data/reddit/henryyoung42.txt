One of Buffet's stated investment principles is never invest in something you don't understand.  Clearly this is simply an admission that he doesn't understand Bitcoin.

When your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Please consider yourself a developer with .NET being but one of your tools.

Tell that to the 100,000 other transactions similarly stuck. Yes I am giving you an opportunity to feel smug ;-)

If "proper" fees had been paid for all the transactions currently in the mempool, they would no longer be proper fees. You can't squeeze more transactions into a block simply by paying more. Sure you can change their prioritization, but you will always be left with a similar backlog.

Given the chance to trade off security against cost and/or time ... people have a well established record of simply ignoring security to save money or time. So that question becomes, is it the crypto thought leaders' responsibility to tell people what's good for them, or allow market forces to create the insecure fast infrastructures that end up getting hacked/gamed.

Please tell that to blockchain.info. I've had a transaction stuck for 24 hours thanks to their fee calculation !

The problem with these fact plus interpretation pieces is it's easy for someone with an agenda to not lie (technically) but feed a totally BS interpretation to a journalist who will be grateful that you even spent time seemingly explaining things to them, then totally fail to second source the material from someone able to balance the interpretation, fundamentally failing to grasp that there are even different camps in the bitcoin world.

Good point re hash rate, unless there's a focus on joint-mined parallel chains. Re shapeshift/privacy, we need some monero like features such as ring signatures added to Bitcoin. But that's hard fork territory :(

Per the title, it would be great to see some trading volume stats on the web site or in the app. Market makers need to see which are the active markets, although those can be guessed from stats on other exchanges. The key to success for a trading venue is liquidity. So Bitsquare would to well to focus on supporting users quoting prices with great tools.

I think the increase in Bitcoin value is kinda lifting it gradually.

VAX being little-endian could throw up some problems ...
