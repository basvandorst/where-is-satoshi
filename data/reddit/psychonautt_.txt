you manipulate triggers, which could cause predictable patterns. these patterns will create movement in your favor.
nobody can set up the price like you imply.
as no politician could just like that build something. he has to manipulate, to trigger certain social patterns, which will create effective movement, which will achieve the goal

either there is a very good bot scheme to support price gain, either the overall sentiment is hold.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:22:04
just because you have same chart graphic, tracking prices of both, doesn't mean they are same

i saw how it goes couple of bucks below my cap for 1 whole coin, was hovering the buy but 10min, and didn't... don't think of it, that's a main mistake in this crypto shit game

to support the price you need activity counted in thousands per minute and again I don't think it's realistic. interesting idea though
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:37:00
actually you are wrong... i'm not here to be millionaire, but to give myself a kick into life. I'm young, developing a startup and don't have any time for it, because I should work and study. And corporations drains you without paying fairly. 
For me couple of thousands of dollars will let me have some air and go ahead. I believe a lot of people here have modest expectations

@_date: 2018-02-16 07:59:21
 do they? why Orban is famous? Why Berluskoni is famous? Why Trudeau is famous?
not directly correlating popularity comes from negative sentiments, but whoever politician does his work properly it's more probable people don't keep much interest in him
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:58:05
kraken covers all the criteria except the alerts... so as I think, you are right, sorry :)

@_date: 2018-02-27 21:46:00
I disagree with the relation between deaths and crypto. We had recently another school shooting? Is that related to crypto? We have thousands of deaths worldwide by drugs and how much of them are bought through crypto?
What you say sound logic, however it's naive.

how much people are following this ultimate "hodl" strategy? BTC looks a lot like The Hunger Games, everyone wants his share of the pie and it doesn't appear to me that anyone gives a fuck about the common subculture to "collectively" hodl. if this is the case, your advice is somehow naive.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:40:26
it is indeed true. Trump is a bad leader and everyone knows him.

how healthy growth looks like? explain pls
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:04:18
well this is precisely the idea... BTC has no price. The price is a product of complex maths. It's defined by the crowd instantly. That is why it will be always volatile, because it's just air.
And we love air, so I don't agree BTC has no value.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:59:36
give more info pls :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:31:29
now srsly :)
you ban **or** you work with the people so they don't want to do such things. money, cryptos, media, books are just instruments through which the freedom of human will express itself. a peaceful mind doesn't do shit. people are not peaceful, because our whole lives were turned subtely into shit by the elites. at some degree they made us feel insignificant peace of shits, whom main goal should be work work work.

capitalism and communism are forms made of ingredients. the ingredients are the nature and forms are what we do of them.
now to the point, communism is evil, because at the beggining it points to getting people's lifes better. that's okay, but system cannot magically achieve it without putting the people into some frameworks, killing some liberties, telling them how (not) to live... it turns that because of the wellbeing of some people out there that you don't know, you should live differently than your dreamed way.
i'm from a former truly socialist country, and i know. communism is evil
there's a simple solution for capitalism's main flaw - a percentage from the corp. profits to go directly to salaries. i tell more info on this in new comment.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:18:28
why a percent of the corporate profits just doesn't go to the employee's salaries on an yearly base?
employees are as important as bosses. so why net profit isn't divided? it will motivate more the employees to be better in their work, it will create a new possibilities for income, other than the strict month.
on a bigger scale this will diminish inequality as boss will gain again but more moderate, while workers spend more and thus credits would be not so needed as the ultrarich will be less, assuming the whole perspective about a "healthy wealthy" man will change, so economy won't experience so this cosmic price difference betweeen a cheap chocolate bar on the street and a luxorious car.

man, don't beg. anyone could say "I'm student". It doesn't matter if the coin will be used or not if it has market value. What you are saying is - pass me the thousands dollars you have in your ledger.

well these cryptos were the pandorra's box out of which everything could go out... you see human nature at its finest... these cryptos it's not clear whether we consume them or they consume us and our precious attention...
at least we have a good jokes over this shit
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:57:39
Here's something interesting to think about
**cryptowat.ch** i guess is used by lots of folks here.
As being connected to most of the major exchanges, this site effectively collects a lot of realtime data.
Note this is a Bitfinex project. The same place where lot of folks here are talking about bots.
Now, imagine what stuff could be achieved with the right minds, correlations and mathematics behind this big data. Doesn't this allow manipulations of epic proportions?
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:50:26
it's not as easily said... what about having more btc at 1k after selling at 2k and double it? this bias is very tricky
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:40:34
when considering cryptos, having opposing views is useful
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:23:42
their twitter has barely activity. they don't have absolutely no one article in google news, published in major media outlet, site is good however too simple, no colateral mentioning with partnering companies, it claims to be mass service and no coverage and networking?
also it doesn't become clear to me how does the price affects the service of this wallet? it's a site, claiming for a visa style service and bang it has some market price, vulnerable to the same speculations as we see on btc.
let me hear your arguments on the contrary - why you thing it isn't a scam?
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:51:22
could you explain a bit more?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:03:10
why volume data diverge so much here  and here &gt; 
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:17:43
why? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:32:38
I'm wondering the same thing... I think it has to do with siphoning the attention in a controlled manner. Too much information, tensions, population, so crypto industries somehow take out much of this and stick so much folks in active age on their screens. That's why the riches and corpos actually find utility in keeping this running, counter to what we tend to think - they hate crypto and are afraid
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:39:00
the dip is amazing for those OUT and nightmare for those IN. price movement is just an elevator with two choices - in or out.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:32:02
What means low volume? Let's get this straight
**a)** Sleeping coins - lots of patient holders      
**b)** Loss of interest generally in Bitcoin        
**c)** People are uncertain and don't act
other opinions are welcome

really astonished by this weird comparison... whale is every normal person with lots of cash, seeking to keep it. billionaires with smart ideas are something different.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:07:48
you are right if you talk about believes. I talk about views. Crypto is a bias in which no body yet could tell what is its future. Lot of people are confused what are they at all, and you want me having a strict solid one way view. 
I let any well argumented views to pass through my perception, so I can consider the whole crypto thing according to them and this way realizing it from different angles. Through time I believe this will lead me to one solid balanced view. Up to then, could you be sure in your solid view? Or its better to hear what people think and get out of your own not yet solid opinion?
as per the intelligence in this sub... yeah I see your point, however you are still here with a reason. and every day I meet interesting people and views here. Some days more than others. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:36:43
how you know who is where?
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:11:43
yep, the moment I have posted the question "don't you think Litepay looks like a scam?", my comment was deleted from the "Daily alt coins discussion"
I still recommend you to dig a bit over the context of this Litepay project and tell me if you feel the smell of scam
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:21:59
it's our own choice to participate this. whales have an advantage of being whales, however they also have the disadvantage of not being flexible. you can not just like that move these bitcoins without the whole market to notice and react.
i got your point, however I'm also not sure if I have created BTC whether I would reveal myself... this is crazy
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:49:57
i smell the vast space in which it could slide down further...

could you clarify what you mean, I miss your point
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:03:46
does that mean however that they also don't have interest the price to go much lower than that?

of course! let's ban also books, because they tell us how to do dirty politics, wars, produce drugs and guns and thus causing millions of deathsin a fairly indirect way
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:25:42
but we also live in a very fast changing world, it's not hard for the same players to tune in a different story in 2-3 years, they won't be so dumb not to realize that more balanced, educated and well cared society will thrive, so they will thrive
not saying we won't witness some big dramatic events, but i feel this fear of apocalypse is maybe a biit hyped... exactly for the reason why "everything is too big to fail", shift is happening in an evolutive way, not "aha" moment way
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:43:28
give please more insight on this view?
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:01:14
kraken. I chose it because i learnt all major btc exchanges in my country are working through kraken, we are talking about volumes of millions of dollars per month. 
i use it over 2 months and they are perfect.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:20:33
the debate gets distorted. when we speak about humans there is nothing absolute, there are always examples of both extremes and you can every time catch some to use as an argument.
what I try to say is some more general principle, proven through the years that when you have a good politician above you, you won't be much interested in him, you won't joke with him, you just follow your flow. in most cases a politician becomes super popular, when he has scandals around him, he is too rich, corrupted and etc.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:16:22
interesting view. it aligns with one of my views about BTC future. however don't you think there are much players with much interest to this to finish so soon? 
Another view I support is that the peak isn't reached yet.
