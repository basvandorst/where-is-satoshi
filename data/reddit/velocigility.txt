it's not an acronym you noob
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:40:24
I will remember. ._.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:57:33
You deserve it for being so naïve.

Let's hard fork Reddit too!

Not necessarily, but I always wonder why people on Facebook who live in South Africa and have no history here have such a stake in our politics.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:42:17
I could care less. (See what I did there?) Thanks, not sure why I did that.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:22:47
Kraken has low fees.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:11:29
They're in for a rough surprise if and when the market corrects.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:40:43
Outperform the stock market this year? Hasn't it already done that several times over?
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:44:50
The money managers who are going out of business because of index funds seem to be the most vocal critics of it, which I find hilarious. It's funny who and what we as a society put stock into. Pun not intentional.
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:13:28
I'm honestly sick of seeing it at all.

You should send me one if/when you get them.

Ironically the people that seem most likely to employ that phrase are also the ones more likely to fall victim to it, in my observation.
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:04:58
Coinbase is a fucking nightmare. Their fees are an order of magnitude larger at least.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:18:08
Step one: don't use Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:08:01
It isn't really. For ETFs you have to buy whole shares. A lot of people who buy are coming from stocks, or have no idea how investing works at all.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:42:52
It can drop substantially and still outperform it. I'd say it's safe to say the jury is out on this one.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:05:41
While you were busy posting this FUD, Dogecoin reached an excellent entry point. Stop wasting your time and buy.

If someone barely has $50 to spend then investing isn't for them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:23:45
That's fantastic. I wouldn't suggest anyone else do it though. Generally, debt should be wiped out before investments... but I can see it paid off. Congratulations, by the way.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:50:06
By your logic, so is S&amp;P. Kick rocks.

You back up the key/seed. If you lose it and the device, you're screwed.

You might want to start your tax planning yesterday, then.

Fake news.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:56:32
Not sure. They're the majority of the volume right now. I was joking that they couldn't read the white paper and figure out it's useless.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:45:17
No. It's over. No one gives a shit anymore, and rightfully so.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:41:50
I really don't like Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:24:44
It represents the greedy fucks who started the fork in the first place making off with a bunch of cash from their market manipulation. If they did this with the stock market they'd be in prison.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:43:49
Awesome, I didn't think I'd have an opportunity to buy BTC under $8,000 again. A happy Thanksgiving to Roger Ver and his autistic posse.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:02:53
I'd buy two BTC and put the rest into alts.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:08:54
Enjoy all the transaction fees on each trade...
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:25:08
I usually invite people to download Blockfolio and just place fake buys.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:32:39
Remember: buy high, sell low.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:07:53
Bitcoin Cash just got dumped. Sorry bud.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:11:15
HELOCs are not that risky.
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:25:00
This is my thought on the matter. It seems most banks and nation states are quietly trying to get in on this. I don't think cryptocurrency would be strictly regulated in the United States, since big money wants a piece as always.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:08:46
Wire funds to Kraken. Buy your chosen currency.

He may be curating his profile to a degree. A lot of people do it, myself included.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:52:25
I say Bitcoin are worth $100 each. Will you sell yours to me at that rate?
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:28:04
Isn't analyzing where your information is coming from critical thinking? Accepting something as being true because it's convenient to your beliefs is confirmation bias. As an aside, I'm certainly not defending JPM here in any way.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:39:06
Thank you. I'm hoping someone could learn from my mistakes. Sometimes the best trades are the ones you don't make.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:19:03
You tell them to go fork themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:09:14
Bitcoin is a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:09:00
This is how you get regulations (and jail time). People are insufferable.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:48:10
Hey, can I take a picture of you real quickly? Thanks...
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:16:38
You'll be back after the fork hype dies down, Bitcoin mellows out, and altcoins rise again.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:30:29
Stop day trading, pick good projects, buy low, sell high. It isn't worth wasting a significant chunk of your week effectively playing high stakes lottery by day trading.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:00:32
Have you heard about Satoshi's vision lately?
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:11:07
We weren't used to it before. The fear of the fork suppressed the price. Now that we realize we can get something out of it, everyone is putting money in to try and realize that gain. However, no one is going to hold onto the new token. It'll subsequently drop and people will divest back into their favorite alts.

Shitcoin Gold fork.

I'm pretty unphased to my own surprise. I've just been buying more.

It's cryptocurrency. It goes up and down.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:20:09
Bittrex is having issues authenticating users as well. Are these two issues related?
