Not bad, but I think the person receiving the tip needs to experience using it. Think about it, even though most people use debit/credit cards these days, they are still spending money and they know that. It's associated in their subconscious at this point. You all need to so the same thing with bitcoins. How I don't know exactly, but giving people the equivalent of a few cents isn't exactly tempting for most.
I like your idea, but with the person receiving the tip being given a link to buy such a trinket and ordering it from said website, much like people do on a fairly regular basis when shopping. You want them to want to use it, right? Show them why it's better to use over their credit/debit cards. Make them see it. They will order something and then get it in the mail. That does so much more to them mentally than 100 bits or 500 bits sitting in a reddit/youtube/twitter account thing.

Recently someone sent a payment to me with no miners fee. Once I saw it I warned them that it may take hours, days or possibly even longer to get confirmed (it was a very small payment). He was ok with waiting because he was new to sending BTC. To both of our surprise, it went through after a couple hours and I still got to ship next day for him. I was shocked.

I posted this yesterday and it didn't get much traction either way. I honestly expected it to be bashed more, even though this isn't about me personally or what I personally feel. Rather it's what I feel would make society respond better with tips.

They won't ever "get" it man. I've tried a few times on here to explain that it's not about me personally, rather how people in general will react to a small tip. My idea is to tip enough for someone to actually use bitcoin to purchase something, even a trinket (think bitcoin sticker or keychain or something). Include the link to said item along with the tip and the person is more likely to go through the process of using bitcoins. That does more than one thing, but the best as far as adoption goes is that they will see bitcoin actually in use and a week or so later they will be holding something that someone on the internet gave them. That "does something" to a person, even if it's subconsciously. Everyone wants this to be the new world currency, but they are limiting it by getting excited over sending each other (already interested parties for the most part) $0.17 at a time.
Entice people to actually use it over just giving them a virtual nickel that they can pass along to another person and so on and so forth. Mass adoption will only come when you all make people use it. This is only one idea and I don't care personally, but this type of thing is what it takes it to make people associate it with spending, or buying, however you want to see it.
The reason I say this is not because I want larger tips (I'm happy with whatever), but if you all as a community/idea want mass adoption, it is better to tip larger. I think that is the disconnect here. One side says anything is good (those that are already interested and/or tipping actively) and then there is society in general and the "typical person" you need to get using it for greater adoption that won't care about a few pennies as a tip more than likely, however will gladly follow step by step directions to get something mailed to them for free.

This by far. Someone posted the bitcoin black friday thing to but honestly there were no "deals" beyond some of the typical promotions we see throughout the year and sometimes we see even better "deals." The bullion people didn't offer much of anything substantial. The post was downvoted into oblivion rather quickly...

You gotta love reddit. ;)
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:18:34
Very cool, thanks. How would you view the current transaction rate?
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:38:24
Yep, I thought I read somewhere that the higher the amount, the higher the priority so you would expect the opposite with a very small amount, which this was. I was shocked, yet pleased that it went through so quickly.
By the way, it is very possible that my understanding is 100% wrong as I am far from a bitcoin expert and only started to accept it because people had asked me to numerous times.

This opinion of mine has nothing to do with me really, I just think this is what a larger audience would respond to in a way I feel people that use it (the tipbot) want it to work.
It's just my idea and opinion about how to get more people to use bitcoins, I may be totally wrong and I'm far from an expert, but it just seems like common sense to me if you guys tipping are using it as a tool for greater adoption. I apologize if I offended or bothered you with sharing it.

Sure thing and thanks for teaching me that you are more than just PR. I assumed Stephen just hired a pretty face to make videos for his company. Cool to know I was wrong there. What else do you do for Amagi?

I can appreciate your opinion, but if the whole point of giving tips is to spread the word and gain interest, I feel it needs to go beyond that. They have to experience the usage in one form or another and there is no better way than buying something. Humans have this funny thing about owning "stuff." Tangible items that they can hold and show others, etc...
I think if you make people use it once, it will catch on better than shuffling some "cents" in value around the internet to each other.

I have been saying similar around there parts lately in an attempt to help the tippers understand that people are more likely to get excited over a couple of bucks instead of $0.17.
My idea is to give a tip that is enough for a user to actually USE the bitcoins to buy a small trinket (think BTC keychain or sticker or whatever) AND include a link for them to do so. This way a new person to bitcoin sees how it is used, orders something using it, then receives an item in the mail, that you the tippper gave to them.
In my mind I think that would have a psychological effect, even if subconscious, that associates bitcoin with buying items online. That is the main way people shop these days. If you associate those two things, more people will adopt bitcoins than if they are constantly shuffling around $0.17 and $0.11 to each other. At least that is my hypothesis.

I know this won't be a popular post here, but these small tips are useless for your cause. [The number collected according to confirms that.]( I have said it before and I'll say it again:
You need to tip an amount that someone can actually USE to purchase something. That something can be just about anything, but some small bitcoin trinket (think keychain, or similar) would probably be best. Provide the tip as well as a link to the product you want the user to buy. This way, the new user will associate bitcoins with shopping and actually buying something over, "Oh cool, someone gave me $0.17!"
Small tips are only making people think and feel that bitcoin users are miserly people I bet and honestly, who wants to be a part of that?
Think about it folks. All I ask.
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:37:31
haha, I'm not sure... I've know about it for YEARS now and always use it to link when people start talking about that.

It never ceases to amaze me that people STILL don't understand that if you make a post and it shows up initially, it can still be sent to the spam folder after some time (automatically by reddit, not anyone reporting or anything, it just happens sometimes). Then a mod has to happen to check the spam area or be alerted that it's "missing" (this is what normal people do when they see their post isn't showing up initially or anymore) in order to approve it and let it be shown again.
Please, understand how reddit works before you go accusing the mods of any sub of being evil and causing unnecessary drama because of your own lack of ability to understand how a website you use works.
This is almost as bad as the people that "catch their cakeday just in time" and think they only have an hour left if it's 11pm when they notice. Your cakeday starts at the precise time you created your account (and will last for 24 hours from that day/time), not at 12:01am the morning of your cakeday.

I am definitely one that tipping worked on. After that I started to accept in for sales of metals on and I've held some and sold some since, always coming out ahead. Love me some BTC.

I have some 1/10th rounds from Silver Circle and still need a 1 ozt version. Were there other sizes made?
That is very cool that you used to work for that movie and Amagi now. Someday I'll sell this business I'm stuck with and move into something involving metals... someday.
