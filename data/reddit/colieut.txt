The Winklevii truly were the secret protagonists of The Social Network

I disagree. In order for that to happen we need a quick, concise way to explain why crypto is good and why people should invest. It was a 20-minute conversation of me explaining precisely how blockchain works that convinced my parents to start investing--but they still don't understand it and the only crypto related articles my dad links me are ones displaying extreme FUD. The language in this space needs to be dumbed down for the masses to understand.

If you want a better general understanding of crypto I'd go with The Modern Investor, Crypto Lark and [twitch.tv/cryptoworldnews]( . That last one is a 24/7 chart watch where traders can discuss price predictions, talk about the tech and just fuck around. Honestly I really love it as a place to chill and hang out lol. The people there are pretty helpful and like giving their opinions on stuff.

Lol I was expecting this to be intentionally low-budget with a bad singer and weird attitude but you/they are a good singer!! The lyrics actually follow the flow of the original track. This is a pretty good rendition overall

Of course. But they will not experience it if they have no interest in understanding why they should start investing.

Libra would be on the ground close to death in front of BTC having already received a brutal beating

this and r/cryptocurrency are absolute piss-garbage subs. But they're super entertaining. If anyone here wants to actually feel informed and LEARN something I recommend [The Modern Investor]( .

Which means when the masses do finally hear about bitcoin's price it could be in $15k, $20k, who knows? By that point they'll freak the fuck out and fomo in even harder than they wouldve at 10k
