Hi guys!
What do you think short term about bitcoin price? Thinking to go allin on Tether and just buy under 10000 USD. Do you still think it will crash?

ICX can provide higher returns than NEO. You want to win big, go for ICX, since it costs 6 usd vs NEO wich costs 65. I know what marketcap is, but market doesn't. It is more likely ICX to reach 20 USD than NEO to reach 150 USD. Between the 2, the safest is NEO, but if you feel a bit of a gambler, go for ICX :).

I am 24% in ICX, 10,45% in TRIG, 9,83% OMG, 9,35% RISE, 9,02% XLM 8,39% NEO 8,62%, NAV 7,63%, STRAT 6,35%, NXT 5,82%, REQ 4,61%, TRST, 3,70%.
I am confident ICX will climb to at least 10 USD. NEO will probably reach 100 USD easily with so many ICOs on NEO next year. If I had bitcoin I would buy as much  NEO as possible. I generally have short term coins.
Feeling bad for not having bitcoin.

Happy New Year everyone!
What do you think BTC will do tonight? Thought BTC will surpass 14k and just sold my NEO for BTC and my Omisego. Hoping for a bitcoin run and alts down.
My portfolio is like this right now : 41,46% bitcoin...25,16% XLM, 19,32% ICX, 10,49% ETH, 3,3% NEO
Any advice? Thank you

Definetely NEO. It doesn't even need China anymore. And there are so many things going on, and with all those ICOs on NEO. I just can't see this one failing.
Another great alt I still think is ICX since they still have to release the mainnet. And it is dubbed the koreean ethereum. If this get added to bithumb and coinone (For sure it will be added to coinone since the founder of ICX also owns coinone), it will make a killing. Koreeans might buy it like crazy. A bit upset I didn't buy more.
