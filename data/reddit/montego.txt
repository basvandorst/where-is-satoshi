I'd say it's more like adding more lanes to a highway, the more cars want to use it.

Canadian Bacon ATMs are the next big thing in finance! Built in deflation as the currency gets eaten.

When a block is hashed, the result is completely random and unpredictable without the full calculation. The most minute change of the block data results in a completely different random result. And it only works one way. There's no way to have a saved hash result and go backwards to figure out how to make the block fit the hash.

The satoshidice URL ends with "?secret=(some random characters)"
That is your login. If you've lost the URL secret that you had when depositing, you've probably lost access to the coins.

It means convenience. No worry about exchange rates or finding the right payment processor for sending money to  anyone, for anything on earth. A global payment system for a globally connected world.

I think they're less than a year old, and still working on things they want to add. I moved to them after trying Jam and LB, mostly for the pool loans, which you can deposit or withdraw anytime. I also have some mining shares and a couple regular loan investments.
Overall, as an investor, I like Pop better than the other two sites. As ever, YMMV.

BTCPop is a lending site like BTCJam and Loanbase, but it also has company shares, mining hashrate shares, pool lending, and even a flat 5% APR savings account.
