LOL. Yet its unfortuate this shitcoin is ranked 12th on Coinmarketcap with a 1.2b market cap.  Perhaps if I was not totally clear prior, I do not disagree with you on two points: 1) it is a shitcoin 2) it is actually worthless.
You don’t have to be insulting or derogatory regarding the use of the term "censoring".  Its a fact of life that off-topic information is censored.  The term itself should not make people kneejerk or uppity.  My suggestion is, posts like these CAN be useful, unless they are deleted and at that point serve zero utility.  I somehow doubt the OP had a vested interest in keeping this "dead shitcoin visible".

Well, its unfortunate some of the attacks are structured from those who currently control key domains, such as [bitcoin.com](  Humans have been conditioned to believe a .COM domain must be a authority so censoring discussion is simply akin to burying our heads in the sand.

Whats wrong with the word "sponsored"? Just because its mis-spelled....

I'd argue discussion of dumping Bitcoin fork coins is a positive lasting message to those who find this thread in the future.  There are many new to the scene who cannot differentiate and are not fully informed, so simply killing off ALL altcoin threads vindictively which have originally directly derived from Bitcoin in affect assists those particular altcoins.  I'm not arguing about removal of ETH or DOGE here.

"filled with inaccuracies"  - Could you please list some of them?  I see interviews with knowledgeable credible people from various areas of finance, and I cannot determine where the false information is.

He literally said "I didn’t want to be the spokesman against bitcoin. I don’t really give a shit — that’s the point, OK?" and ppl laughed.  It was at the Axios conference.
This post is a dupe from 4 hours prior.

This is kinda media sensationalistic bullshit really. The CRA and FINTRAC already have access to every Canadian residents bank account and already run Big Data analytics on it looking for evaders and irregularity.  All financial institutions are required to report any transactions over 10K, just to ensure they are noticed by CRA.  Any MSB in Canada begins their AML/KYC at $3k, a longstanding practice. So really, whats the big deal having half a million random people's records being statistically analyzed when StatsCan has no enforcement mandate or desire. They are attempting to determine changes and trends for the public good by studying raw data in the Internet Age. If people should be upset by anything, be upset about US FACTA which demands Canadian institutions directly gift all financial data directly to the IRS they wish it.  What other personal data simply leaks out when Federal or Provincial departments contract US-based organizations such as HP or IBM?
We should realize banks are not law firms providing client confidentiality. They simply don’t care about individual customers and only care about their next record quarterly earnings.

Agreed.  The Crown wants to keep its thumb on their peasants.
Canadians are forced to do annual tax returns when CRA automatically does them for us anyway! If you have a single T4 and no extra income, and no change from the previous year, why bother!?  Investment income generate T5's from financial institutions and are added to income automatcally regardless.  So the only thing a boring normal law abiding person should provide is declaring extra income, if and when they have some.
This is what Australia does. Simplfies and streamlines the process for millions of people.

I have always wondered if its a combination of both Nick and Hal and they purposefully obfuscated the writing style of the white paper to keep people guessing for decades.  Hal and Nick were both experimenting early in 2009.  
As many as said over the years, it probably doesn't matter who Satoshi is at this point, other than he may have a million coins stashed somewhere, or hes burned them intentionally. 
The news media loves a good mystery and we've got a really great creation story!

Sounds sketchy AF to me.  If he has BTC to sell, he only needs to show you his public address proving he IN FACT has that amount of BTC.  If its legit, then he can use his bitcoin wallet software to send directly to your friends bitcoin wallet software between your phones (by scanning QR codes, simply put), and wait for a couple confirmations to assure its moving.  No way anyone should give login credentials to a system you've subscribed to.

Exactly!  I've been consistently amused by his kneejerk reactionary statements.  He might even realize he was foolish to shit-talk it prior to understanding it, but now that hes sticking to his story it makes awesome fodder for MSM to simply just keep asking "sooo... how about that bitcoin stuff?"  Hes another Warren Buffet.

A old tweet from 2018. 
Why not post something recent which reflects recent thoughts:
"Bcash is dead. Time to dump this worthless crap. Had a chance at success  but momentum is now working against it. Toxic community. Will be  unfollowing Bcash focused accounts on here. Good riddance."
People tend to miss the general premise that attacks on Bitcoin serve a useful function by making it more resilient. No one needs a fragile coin which falls over with the first breeze.
Lets dispense with the FUD generating posts please.

An easy to boot and install full node ISO running on FBSD?  And with amazing storage management potential beneath its feet?
Who doesn't want a 8, 16, even 48-drive ZFS full-node?!?!

Looking through his post history it seems 8 of 10 tweets are on the right side with his judgement and I dont see anything to suggest he is actively trying to scam. But yes, everyone is entitled to be wrong at times.  
Decency and humility comes when they realize and admit it. People make mistakes and good people learn from them.

Actually, its almost the direct opposite of pedantic. Perhaps you meant this post was somewhat didactic? Well, the point of this post is to illustrate the white paper was not intended to be a complete rigid framework nor was it completely revolutionary or original, but borrowed aspects from ideas which proceeded from **Hal Finney\*** Wei Dai, Adam Back, and possibly Nick Szabo. This is provable by realizing SN purposefully left out function from the paper which appeared in his source code. Reading early emails between people involved between 2008 to 2010, you can see SN was completely open to differing paths and ideas which may improve the protocol. He never came off as self-righteous or stubborn when a alternate idea was presented.  Shows great humility.
I’d suggest at the time when posted in 2008, SN’s concept for change was like many open source projects based on philanthropic principles from software developers. Looking back to 1999, the near complete re-write of SSL could also be identified as another project with significant global importance, realizing that alternative versions of SSL emerging at the time violated GPL and restricted where and how SSL could be used and, amazingly, prevented versions with Microsoft Windows. See: [ . This disgusted many and a small team of developers and cryptographers decided to improve this.  To me its much like traditional banking annoyed SN to the point where he developed code for almost 2 years prior to its first public disclosure.  Passion, dedication, devotion and countless hours of hard work on his part?  Yes, definitely.  But a mythical Messiah of biblical proportions as some suggest?  No, I don’t think so.  I think that is Mow’s primary point.  The white paper was drafted as an idea to be improved upon, like many open source projects and that is what we have seen over the past 10 years.  It is however undoubtedly beautiful work from a great team of contributors over the past decade. Thank you for your reply.
\*edit: neglected to mention Hal Finney who created PoW in 2004

A news story that only cites its own previous story from October 28, 2018 as a reference, yet does not cite any other news source in either Chinese or English, does not seem credible.  The court system in China is not like Western countries either, so a ruling from one city or province does not make precedent even if a case in Shenzhen says so. That being said, I'm asking people who speak Mandarin to verify this.
