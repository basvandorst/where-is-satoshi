I'm becoming less convinced of this. I used to be of the mindset that price followed adoption. And by adoption I mean in the form of new users buying coffee, plane tickets, services, etc. with bitcoin.
The more time goes on, the less appeal I see to using bitcoin as a medium of exchange at least *at the moment*. I think there's some good indications that when looking at the "Trifecta of Money" (store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account), the first that needs establishment is the store of value. The medium of exchange aspect simply can't occur if the price is jumping all over the place. Speculators and deep markets are required first to allow a more stable price to emerge for everyday transactions.

And that's the thing, it won't. Bitcoin's selling point is decentralization which comes as an affront to modern banking.
There is already a common public narrative surrounding the banks. And it isn't a positive one. Once people understand that there's a way to opt out of banks while still enjoying modern financial services, I think banks will be in an increasingly difficult position. Most banks don't have customers because of some brand loyalty or something (although credit unions might). It's because people have no other choice. If you want modern financial services, you're playing by their rules. Well, that's changing.
They've completely abused public trust and I'm skeptical that association is going to go away because they've thrown some deformed technology into their architecture.

- Pseudonymous inventor, but not terribly important because the code is open-source.
- Political leanings obvious in creation (Genesis block included the text: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks)
- Call it what it is: a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital cash system.
- First tech in history to allow digital value transfer between individuals without the need for a third-party processor (bank, paypal, etc.)
- Fixed issuance schedule, mathematical scarcity.


- Highlight big name merchants (Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Virgin, Microsoft, etc.)
- Estimated 2-5 million users
- Could also bring up blockchain.info to look at real-time transactions


- Straight forward (bitcoinwisdom)


- Mining companies (BitFury, etc.)
- Payment processors (BitPay, Coinbase)
- Wallet companies (Mycelium, breadwallet, CoinKite)
- ATM companies (Lamassu)
- New, big players (Nasdaq, NYSE, 21 Inc, Digital Asset Holdings, etc)


- Coinmarketcap.com for a list of the largest cryptos.
- Network effect of bitcoin will likely cause it to remain on top.
- Open-source nature *can* allow bitcoin to add beneficial new features that other cryptos bring.


- Low market liquidity the cause of price fluctuation. Moving relatively small amounts of money in to, or out of, bitcoin causes price swings.
- Volatility decreases as market depth increases.
- 3,600 bitcoins are mined everyday, flat price implies growth.


- Who the hell knows. The most substantial statement I'm willing to make on the price topic is that in the long term (10+ years), I think the demand for bitcoin will outpace the supply.
Hope this helps!

The idea is that most day-to-day transactions are for amounts small enough that zero confirmations is alright. Like you said, it's a calculated risk.
Theoretically, the block time could be decreased, but that'll be a difficult thing to find consensus around. I'd imagine trustless off-chain solutions will be the answer here.

What is lost on many people is they are in fact paying to have zero personal responsibility. 
They sometimes literally pay for it (account sign-up fees, maintenance fees, overdraft fees, etc.) but more often it's paid for in a non-monetary sense. The loss of direct control, censorship of specific transfers, restrictive banking hours, long settlement times, chargebacks, and most importantly, enabling the malicious actors who dragged the world economy through the mud.
What the bitcoin ecosystem needs to do is build decentralized solutions that offer a similarly low requirement for personal responsibility. If we can offer the same value proposition to the consumer (having ample recourse if something goes wrong), in a way that still retains bitcoin's core value proposition, I think we'll see a shift in public consciousness.
All of a sudden people can get the services they're used to without having to shoulder the extra burden of learning (gasp!) basic computer security, *and* they won't have to support the criminals in the banking sector.
It's a tall order, but I'm optimistic.

Ok, that clears things up a bit.

Neither of these comments has much weight.

I've found bitcoin to be a topic that either immediately appeals to someone, or immediately gets dismissed.
In general, when I get the responses you've stated above, I typically say there are explanations but they're usually long-winded and a little complicated. If they're willing to actually get into the discussion I'm happy to get into it with them, but only if they really want to. This doesn't work well in groups unless everyone is really curious.

This is the problem OpenBazaar aims to address.
And yes, multi-sig is at the heart of it. But you need a neutral third-party to help with potential conflicts.
A 2-of-3 multisig wallet is created between the buyer, seller, and a notary. The buyer sends bitcoin into this shared wallet from a separate address. This can serve as proof of payment. The seller then sends the product, but no single party can move the funds at this point. If the seller sends some bogus item, the buyer appeals to the notary. Assuming the notary rules in the buyers favor, the notary and the buyer each sign a transaction from the multi-sig wallet back to the buyer, and the notary takes a small cut.
If the item is as described, the buyer and seller sign transactions to a separate address of the seller. No fee.

I really appreciate your grounded approach. It's not exactly expressed in the majority.
My question is, if bitcoin is to make a huge difference in the world, what's the argument for why it *wouldn't* generate a semi-substantial return for people currently involved.
It kinda just comes down to simple math.
To be fair, the argument that you can tie up huge amounts of fiat in a small amount of bitcoin (colored coins) is totally valid . But it also isn't a great idea to have your securing network (bitcoin) be orders of magnitude cheaper to attack in relation to the asset inside. In other words, you don't want to store a gold brick in a toy safe.

The thing about open, empowering pieces of technology (the internet, bitcoin, etc.) is that they provide a complete reflection of society.
"What if the internet is used to sell drugs?" was an early criticism. To be sure, the internet is used to facilitate a staggering amount of drug trade. But no one aruges the net effect of the internet has been anything but positive and liberating.
I believe the same about markets and trade. OpenBazaar opens this platform to anyone with internet access. Instead of hoping you're lucky enough to be in one of the [10 countries which Amazon operates]( you're now able to access a truly global marketplace. If the buyer has a shipping address, they're a potential customer. That type of thing has never happened before. Certainly not for 90% of the planet.
Law enforcement still has many tools at their disposal to address illicit trading. In short, I wouldnt' worry about whether drugs are sold on OpenBazaar. People should use it if *they* find it beneficial.

Well, I can't take a reply like that seriously.
There came a fork in the road regarding bitcoin's potential to scale and Gavin felt there was enough information to choose a direction. Now whether or not that was the right choice, the right understanding, the right framework etc., is beside the point. I see nothing wrong with choosing a side with what one feels to be the best information at the time. You may disagree with him believing he had the best information, or even feel that him thinking he had the best information is clueless. But to imply that your perceived cluelessness of him somehow extends beyond a confined example is pretty baseless. He's done a lot for bitcoin. To suggest otherwise is completely clueless.
To be clear, I'm not convinced XT was the right choice.

I think the author has realized, using far too many words, that bitcoin isn't an easy sell to those with a broad range of financial services.
I think this is pretty well understood. We (the developed world) have a financial system that places *zero* personal responsibility on the end-user and doesn't cost them anything.
Except it *does* cost them something. The costs just aren't typically monetary in nature. They're behind the scenes in the form of lost control, confiscation, and censorship.
I'll ignore the fact that we're comparing a mature, 60 year old technology (credit cards), to a fledgling, 6 year old technology that has a history riddled with controversy. And identifying the fact that people with established, relatively low-friction banking services aren't flocking to bitcoin en masse is somehow a profound thought?
Get real.
Let's talk about expanding financial access. Because we know the poor aren't going to get that on the back of a Visa card. I don't care if bitcoin becomes the de facto way to buy coffee in the US and western Europe.

I agree that people don't academically grasp the importance of decentralization, but I think they generally understand the *effects* of it.
If people needed to provide an ID anytime they wanted to access the wifi at a coffeeshop or the library, the internet would become less compelling. I think people understand the importance of keeping the internet open and unrestricted. Society just doesn't have that association with finance because it's never existed before.
There will also be products/services that are only going to be available to users of decentralized cryptocurrencies. OpenBazaar is a great example of this. There's no chance that Bankcoin customers are going to get unrestricted access to something like that.
The big hurdle is in providing a user experience that mimics the usability and security that people are used to. Right now, we're obviously not there.
But having watched this ecosystem evolve over the last 4 years, there's no chance in hell I'd be betting *against* people solving (and probably exceeding) these older standards.

I reject that premise because I think it creates a false dichotomy. The success of an Abra teller doesn't necessarily depend on them mimicing the operating standards of a WU location.


You can make the same arguments against Uber drivers from the position of the cab companies.
"Are you going to get in some sketchy guy's car or are you going to get in a licensed taxi?"
The answer is: I'm going to go to whomever gives me the best service/value. Period. So if the Abra teller will meet me halfway, has a solid reputation/rating, and doesn't charge me 10% to send my money, then it's a no-brainer.

Many people here are probably above average in their ability to use a computer/the internet. For most, once they've reached a certain aptitude, it's easy to lose sight of where the majority stand. However, that doesn't make it right to berate people who don't share your expertise for something, and this subreddit is particularly quick to annoy.


I don't think you're helping with using verbiage like 'hatred'. From what I can gather, most pro-bitcoin people don't seem to feel the skeptical camp has a strong platform. In my case, it's more that I don't find bitcoin sketpics to be very imaginative. Many of their arguments are perfectly valid at the moment. I think a lot of people simply think those arguments will become less and less true/relevant over time.

I think that's fine. If people want the added peace of mind, they're welcome. I think if bitcoin products/services continue to make near bullet-proof security easy, straight-forward, and very difficult to mess up, people may start feeling as though they *can* in fact trust themselves. I believe the process can become painfully difficult to mess up. That said, people will *still* mess it up and I'd argue that bitcoin isn't, and will never be, for them.

Keep in mind that Dark Wallet is in alpha right now.
The testnet is used to allow people to experiment without risking actual bitcoins. The purpose of the seed is to provide an avenue of recovery. I believe DW uses a hierarchical deterministic approach to addresses, so retaining a seed will allow you to regenerate a wallet from anywhere. So even if every piece of computing equipment you own becomes lost or destroyed, you can still regenerate the wallet if you remember the seed.

You seem to ignore any other use-case. Take gold for example. Are people who hold gold bullion in a safe-deposit box actually *using* it? I would argue they are - they're using it as a store of value. 
The same thing applies to bitcoin. Now, please don't misinterpret this as me qualifying bitcoin as a *good* recent store of value. Simply that people use it and look at it as such. So you can say that not many consumers are using bitcoin as a percentage of all global commerce. Unfortunately, you can't say that about global consumers *using cryptocurrency*. In that sense, bitcoin is likely 98%+ of all crypto-commerce.
And yes, BitPay could easily add support for any other altcoin. That's not a problem. The problem is in security. At this time, bitcoin is the most secure protocol, has the most commerce, and has the most active dev team. No altcoin can currently compete on these fronts. You can say that you think one *will in the future*, but you still have all your work in front of you to provide anything that can be considered an argument in favor of a superior alternative.

I think hardware wallets are awesome and a necessary piece to the puzzle.
The idea of a separate, dedicated device (trezor, ledger, case) is the only thing that gives me pause if I'm thinking about the average person. All signs point to us going the route of everything being on the smartphone - your computing, communication, authentication (house key, car key, etc), money, etc.
So part of me feels the future here is that the hardware wallet becomes part of your phone. If there needs to be a separate hardware device (and maybe there really should be), I think something like [Google's Project Vault]( is what it will be. It being open-source (in both software and hardware) is utterly necessary, and once it gets the thumbs up from security experts and developers, the average person is just going to trust the tech community that it's safe.

That's extremely unlikely. Most people with large bitcoin stakes have those coins for largely ideological reasons. In other words, they believe in what bitcoin stands for.

I think a large portion of the people saying these figures are possible, aren't stringently holding to that 2016 date, but rather to a 2020+ date
Is it possible that 15-20% of gold migrates into bitcoin? Absolutely. Now, what's a reasonable timeframe to imagine this happening? I've no idea. But I will say that I think most people would've laughed discussion of '$500 bitcoins in two years' out of the room in 2011. Let's all keep an open mind here.

I think the semi-centralization of mining has, for the most part, been inevitable. How big of an issue this is is still left to be seen. I suppose the question is, can things remain decentralized *enough*? I'm inclined to say yes, but I could certainly be wrong.
Compared to the current system of complete centralization, the only direction is up, so to speak. Even though the mining landscape is heading in a more centralized direction, it's just that - more centralized, not fully centralized.

Keep in mind that for at least the first two years, bitcoin was completely unknown outside of very select circles.
Second, bitcoin is dealing with the topic of money - arguably the most important social construct in human history. With Facebook/Twitter/etc, what does one risk by exploring the service? Practically nothing except a trivial amount of their time. If they don't like it, or the service goes away, they're not really punished in any tangible way.
Bitcoin has *real* risk associated with it, so it stands to reason that people would be weary. As the technology solidifies, it's likely this weariness will decrease and people will feel more and more comfortable getting involved.
It also need to be realized that seeing as bitcoin is an internet-based technology, most involved are in technologically literate locations. Governement currencies and traditional payment networks in developed areas are typically pretty good, so the need for a lot of what bitcoin brings forward isn't terribly apparent at first glance. I'm fairly certain that the people who could benefit the most from bitcoin (much of the developing world) aren't even aware of its existence.

Please don't spread baseless statements like this.
Here's the answer:
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:52:55


Nothing says that won't happen. What I don't understand is the desire (need?) for certainty that that *won't* happen. The thing is, anyone mining bitcoin in 2009 who still has control of their coins, has already made an enormous amount of money. What I think you're missing is the way in which that money leaves bitcoin for fiat. The fear seems to be that this individual is going to go to an exchange (or several) and fill bids all the way down to single digits. That's not going to happen. And even if it did, it's not like it can happen repeatedly.


Easy - I don't. Any investment is a game of risk/reward. If you don't want risk, don't expect a reward. A savvy investor, as you put it, understands this.


Indeed. And the numbers we're speaking of are probabilities. As an extreme example, is it probable that an airplane will be torn apart from turbulence mid-flight? No. But is it possible? Absolutely.
Could I give a passenger "trust that such a thing definitely won't happen"? No, but I could show him/her that such an event is extremely unlikely. Now, I'm not equating the likelihood of a plane being torn apart from turbulence with an super-early adopter liquidating their bitcoin position in the most financially insane way possible, but I will certainly argue the latter is a long shot.

"Bitcoin leadership"

@_date: 2014-01-11 02:01:30
Well, the argument against it is that it makes lending and investing less compelling. For example, if you make an investment of $100 today and we'll say the rate of deflation is 5%/yr, then you'll want to get &gt;5% return on your investment, otherwise you would've been better off simply holding the currency and not investing.
The main rebuttal to the above is that deflation only really becomes a problem in a *debt based* society (the debt you're shouldering today is going to weigh more in the future). That being said, I haven't come across a compelling reason to believe that deflation simply due to a restricted supply, is a bad thing.

1.) This isn't new. Hackers have known about bitcoin for it's entire history.
2.) You haven't a clue what the "average world citizen" would want - you'd simply be guessing. One thing's for sure though: there are dozens of *entire populations* that would welcome *anything* over their current system, let alone the substanital improvement in fiscal transparency that bitcoin provides. Calling it an "anonymous anarchist computer program" is just being daft.
3.) Wall St. and VC firms are interested in making money and *continuing* to make money. There's much more longevity (and thus potential for a higher ROI) if you build products/services that have an ability to evolve moving forward. If you think these people are looking at tomorrow, you're mistaken - they're looking years down the line.

To anyone reading, BitCyprus is technically correct - Neo is not a bank by traditional definitions. They don't do lending, fractional reserve, etc.

I think what is referring to is the ability to counterfeit precious metals in a way that's *good enough*.
I could take it one step farther and say that even on an absolute scale, it isn't impossible. [Transmutation]( isn't currently possible (in the way we're talking), but there's no reason to think it will  be that way forever.

Sure, they've heard the word 'bitcoin'. But I can safely say the general public most certainly doesn't *know* bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:28:37
What implication? Bitcoin enables *choice* in the matter. If an individual would like to trust their wealth to a central party, I for one won't stand in their way. There will never be a shortage of people willing to perform some action or service in exchange for a percentage.
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:22:34
But that's not reflective of the situation with bitcoin.
The example would be more apt if Pakistan was known to have control of roughly 7.5% of the total gold in the world (satoshi is believed to have 1 million of the ~13 million bitcoins total).
Would that be cause for concern? Maybe a little, but you seem to be conveniently ignoring the financial insanity of immediately liquidating a position like that. If the goal is to turn your gold (or bitcoin) into a lot of dollars or rupees, then it makes sense to liquidate that position over time.
It really depends on the mindset of the person/people holding the asset. 60% of all gold is used in jewelry and most of that resides in India and China. Does that hurt the store of value potential of gold? Probably not, because people understand the ideology of those holding gold jewelry isn't to make a quick buck.
I'd venture to say the same of bitcoin pioneers.

I must say I dislike this stance. The trolls and scammers are such a detraction from a completely revolutionary technology, that you're contemplating "selling everything" and essentially wiping your hands of the whole thing? Does that not strike you as needlessly dramatic?
I'd suggest focusing on the works of those actually building and making progress within bitcoin. Forget about the avenues that allow anyone with an internet connection to spout nonsense. Criticizing and trolling are incredibly easy and require little more than a warm body to espouse. 
Cheer up, there's too much utility in this to have a relatively small collection of trolls and scammers ruin it all.

@_date: 2014-01-25 01:52:40
The problem is you're acting as if your opinion is a foregone conclusion. You can't possibly know if the people holding large portions of bitcoin have an incentive to depress innovation. If anything, I'd argue those individuals have an incentive of making bitcoin as functional and long lasting as possible. That doesn't mean a 'la la la I'm not listening' approach, either. Many of the large holders got into bitcoin for ideological reasons and making improvements will only help bitcoin's "stickiness".
With all due respect, most of what I've seen you post just strikes me as needlessly pessimistic and argumentative.

@_date: 2014-12-15 23:37:17
I think is talking a bit more in general. If you look at the characteristics which make something a good candidate for money/currency, bitcoin is about as good as it gets.
This *doesn't* mean the market must align with that and the price must go through the roof as a result. You looking at the past year and quoting a 70% decrease in value isn't a game you want to play. I can simply ask you to look at a longer timeframe and then quote a percent increase measured with 4 digits.
I think the point is that all indications point to bitcoin continuing to grow. I don't see much wrong with stating this fact, nor with being optimistic (even crazily so) about the future. It should stand to reason that anyone offering guarantees should be looked at skeptically, end of story.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:05:57

Haha, that's not remotely accurate. People taking positive, optimistic attitudes toward bitcoin are like people taking positive, optimistic attitudes toward their toddlers' future. Hanging on the negatives and shortcomings does *nothing* productive. Identifying them, sure. But not dwelling.

@_date: 2014-03-07 00:34:20
I must admit, it seems like you're not genuinely asking the title question. You appear to already have your mind made up. In case you are asking in seriousness, consider this:
Much of what bitcoin improves on isn't going to be immediately apparent to an upper middle class citizen of the US/Western Europe. If you're *only* looking at bitcoin as a transactional currency (it's much more than that) and are evaluating it based solely on desirable attributes of currencies, it currently falls short of a handful of fiat currencies (USD, GPB, EUR). But keep in mind there are nearly 200 fiat currencies, a couple dozen of which bitcoin, as it stands today, is substantially superior to.
At this moment, the upper middle class western consumer doesn't stand to gain much from using bitcoin to purchase goods. I personally see bitcoin as an improvement on the existing system, but I understand if a large portion of the above demographic don't see it as worth the hassle.
Talk to someone who is having their currency debased by 30%/year or someone who's been part of a bail-in proceeding. Bitcoin solves much larger issues for people than simply increasing the efficiency of online purchases.

The point is to look at the two things you're comparing in their entirety. The traditional finance system has major resource demands (printing, transportation, distribution, construction of branches/infrastructure, powering that infrastructure, personnel, etc). Bitcoin by contrast has far fewer demands, but likely a higher power requirement.
Does this net in bitcoin's favor? I'm not sure. My guess is yes, but in any event, I think it's disingenuous to place bitcoin in the line of fire without first considering the full picture of what it could replace.

There's a balance between compassion and ridicule for people who have been exploited or taken advantage of by something, depending on specifics.
Given that the words "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" are thrown around here enough to drive a person insane, coupled with the fact that anyone who has even heard of bitcoin (let alone been compelled to purchase some) really *must* understand that they are traveling in turbulent, uncharted waters. To say otherwise is arguing for too little personal accountability.

@_date: 2014-12-27 22:45:17
At this stage, bitcoin is practically interchangable with the word cryptocurrency. It comprises over 80% of the total crypto market. Eventually there comes a point where it's almost certainly easier to amend the current front-runner than it is to bootstrap an entirely new coin. Aside from Ethereum (which Counterparty apparently has some response to - I'm not up-to-date) there isn't an altcoin on the horizion that stands a solid chance of dethroning bitcoin.
I'm not saying such a thing is impossible. It's simply unlikely at this point and it isn't getting any easier. In fact, it's just the opposite.
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:58:53

@_date: 2014-02-28 18:05:23
I'd argue that's probably not the case, to be honest. The aspect where people begin parting company is when people talk about what bitcoin is 'supposed' to be. Some people (a lot here) talk about bitcoin becoming the only currency, or that it will un-seat all fiat currencies. That's probably not the case. 
But rarely is a simple offer of an additional choice seen as ridiculous. It's when people start speculating on what it will become (and what it ought to become) that starts the disagreements.

Are you under the impression that Robocoin just has this unwavering desire to collect ID information? In order for them to remain outside a jail cell, they need to comply with existing regulations. I can assure you, if a bitcoin ATM is offering two-way services, and they're based in the US, they'll need to jump through the same hoops.
Complain about the regulations, not Robocoin.

Bitcoin can be tough to grasp, especially at your first introduction. I'm an engineer with a penchant for tech and it took me a could months to wrap my head around.
I think you should emphasize how bitcoin can impact the developing world. Half the global population lacks a basic bank account. For the first time in history, a man in Johannesburg can send money to his mother in Mumbai nearly instantly, for practically no fee, and without the need for advanced infrastructure or permission. Impoverished people are paying an average of almost 9% to send money internationally.
This shit needs to change.

This is pejorative at best and flat out wrong at worst. Neo is not technically a bank and at this point doesn't fall under the regulatory oversight of existing banks in Cyprus.

I'm not so sure about that. There's good evidence to suggest that bitcoin will be able to implement sidechains/treechains to address the slow confirmation time. And again, for most POS purchases, the risk associated with accepting zero confirmation transactions is pretty low.

I read the comment string and I guess I don't really see your point.
Yes, eventually bitcoin will probably be replaced by something superior. But so what? What are you suggesting? Are we supposed to wait until something better is invented? But then what? Isn't that a bit like saying one shouldn't buy a smartphone because a better one will be out next year?
This isn't a discussion about whether bitcoin will be around until end of time. It's about whether bitcoin represents something that's *good enough* to move forward with. At this point in time, that answer is obviously yes as there isn't an independent altcoin remotely on the horizon of supplanting bitcoin.

I think the real argument is based on what's best for society. Regardless of what's easiest, is having a monetary system based on debt the best we can come up with? I'm inclined to say no and now the challenge is making a system that competes in a way that people are incentivized to use.

There was no investing in "the internet". There was investing in internet companies. And yes, those were a mixed bag, some certainly became rich, others lost their shirts.
I feel it'd be more apt to compare one being able to invest in TCP/IP early on. Obviously that would've played out well for everyone who did (which we have no guarantee of bitcoin replicating), but you can't compare investment in a protocol (bitcoin) to investment in surrounding infrastructure (early tech companies)

What you've outlined was put in place to provide an avenue for inspection if a customer were so inclined. Cypriots have been badly burned by financial institutions in the past and simply providing the option for independent verification of funds is a huge step forward.
There's no getting around the second paragraph. Bitcoin transactions are final and the customer needs to be made aware of this. I don't see anything requiring computer savviness outside of the ability to do any type of online banking. The only additional piece to make sure the customer understands is that these are permanent, so make sure to double check ;)

I say this day-in and day-out:
which "average Joe" are you speaking of? The average upper-middle-class Joe in the US/Western Europe? Because if so, that average Joe doesn't have too much friction in making payments. Is bitcoin still a preferable method? I sure think so, but I can understand that sentiment not being widely shared.
Now consider the average Joe in Argentina or Cyprus or Kenya or any of the other myriad of countries with capital controls, rampant inflation, or bail-in proceedings. The idea that bitcoin, first and foremost, should stand to make the day-to-day purchases of the world's wealthiest slightly easier is an absurd notion.

I'm so torn on Peter Thiel as it pertain to bitcoin.
On the one hand, he genuinely seems to appreciate the tech and also seems to have some grasp of its implications, hurdles, etc.
And on the other hand, he says things like he's not sure if the government is going to shut it down, which IMO, shows a complete lack of understanding of: 
a.) the discussions that have already happened at high levels of government (which aren't leaning in that direction)
b.) the fact that a number of governments have already weighed in on the debate
c.) the number of 'legitmate' transactions *has* been increasing rapidly
d.) arguably the most compelling use case for bitcoin is in the un/underbanked. I don't think a large portion of the western world has an incentive to pursue bitcoin outside of political leanings and/or speculation.
It seems like he's keeping up with the technology to the bare minimum someone of his stature should be.

Anyone who spends even a cursory amount of time here knows debating with you is a fool's errand.
That said, I'm bored, so here we go:


&lt;citation needed&gt;


It's almost embarassing this needs to be pointed out. I suggest you have a look [here](


Given that I can easily exchange dollars (which I assume you believe to be firmly rooted in reality) for bitcoins, and vice versa, I'm going to say your definition of 'fantasy' isn't remotely inline with any definition agreed upon by society. You see, words have actual meanings. And in this case, anyone with an opposable thumb would find using the word 'fantasy' to describe bitcoin as obviously inappropriate.


Once again, your issue is with the existence of arguably the most basic economic principle. If you lost track, it's [here](


Ah yes, it wouldn't be complete without you working yourself into a froth and making a claim that once again, because words have actual meaning, is completely nonsensical.
A ponzi scheme has to meet certain criteria to be titled as such. Just as a burrito has to involve a certain ingredient (a tortilla of some variety) to be called a burrito. To be a ponzi scheme, the foremost need is the presence of a 'ponzi'; a promoter or operator, who "entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent"
Bitcoin has no such figure, nor any such promise of high return.
Now, I don't expect any of this to be compelling to you. After all, we've seen at least two instances where you lacked the ability to adequately assign widely agreed upon definitions to the words you use. So where most people read 'open-source, cryptographic protocol', you read 'man behind curtains wants my precious'.

People who've paid attention to this whole mess will start to demand more from exchanges. We've seen how things can go south and I think it stands to reason that the exchanges that are the most transparent and doing the most to ease customer concerns, will likely reap the rewards of an increased customer base.
Hopefully they understand that the community demands more transparency and  professionalism.
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:47:50
I'm not familiar with too many people who think bitcoin is going to be the only big cryptocurrency ever.
Having said that, altcoins face a couple hurdles in their pursuit to wider adoption. The most substantial of which is probably in what they do differently than bitcoin. If they're just bitcoin clones, there isn't any compelling reason to use them aside from novelty (which will probably only subside as cryptocurrencies become more familiar).
Now, say the coin actually does something different - it improves on bitcoin in some way. The thing to keep in mind is that if the difference is big enough, or useful enough, bitcoin can always incorporate that functionality and now your altcoin has lost its edge.
The way I see it, for any altcoin to stand a reliable chance of dethroning bitcoin, it will have to either improve in a way bitcoin isn't able to implement, or hope that it's utility is high enough to drag people over and that bitcoin won't incorporate that utility.

Sigh, alright.
I don't see MC as having anything to gain by spending money in the form of R&amp;D, roll-out, education, etc. if the coin is going to be entirely internal anyway. The benefits of bitcoin are precisely in the fact that it *doesn't* rely on one entity shouldering that weight nor does it have a single point of failure.
How do you imagine MC actually using this coin? Do you think they'll create a coin that requires mining? Why bother with mining at all? Mining exists to allow a group of untrusting people to reach a consensual agreement on the state of a ledger and to issue the currency. If this is centralized, they're the ones auditing the ledger, so whatever they say goes anyway. And, surprise, this is exactly what they have now.
So now your turn. Explain to me what exactly MC has to gain by making their own "coin".

@_date: 2014-04-15 18:55:38


I think there's probably a better way of looking at this. I wouldn't consider bitcoin to be balanced on a single ledger. In your scenario, there would be millions of copies of this ledger. So long as these copies exist, things could continue. One could also say the entire world hangs on a single internet. Which I suppose is technically true, but it doesn't exactly fall in line with the spirit of that statement.
I'd argue there wouldn't be a huge incentive to seek control because controlling it would go against one of the very fundamentals of bitcoin that people believe in. Most feel confident in the fact that no single party controls it. Take that away and confidence decreases (probably rapidly).


This will need to be addressed. I'm not sure if the sidechains proposal can help with this, but it's a known hurdle for expansion.
I personally think the concerns around a 51% attack are overblown. I don't believe governments would operate in a manner that falls in line with a narrative that any 15yo with a rudimentary knowledge of bitcoin could conjure up.

Bitcoin's best aspect isn't in its ability to serve as a speculative vehicle for Americans. It's in its ability to essentially have a bank in your pocket. It enables the billions of people without access to financial services the ability to actually interact with a global liquidity pool.

The only reason I (or anyone for that matter) should reply to you is on the off chance that someone who isn't wasting away their existence trolling a subreddit may be genuinely curious.
There isn't enough friction in point-of-sale payments for the average upper-middle-class American to see a substantial benefit in using bitcoin. I still contend it's a preferable payment method due to the increase in privacy (I don't have to hand my credit card over to a stranger).
The largest benefit will be realized by those who don't have established financial services or stable government currencies. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:25:39
That's true currently, but certainly won't remain that way. We need development that is capable of simplifying advanced resources (bitcoin, internet, etc) to be useful for even the extremely poor/uneducated.
Things aren't perfect now, but they're being worked on and are for sure improving.
Bitcoin still has a lot of benefit to offer the developed world, it's just of a different nature.
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:26:08
I honestly don't see that as a driving force. In order for people to feel compelled to mine a given altcoin, it's presumably because they think the value of that altcoin is going to, at worst, remain relatively stable, and at best, increase in value.
But what compelling reason would there be for either of those scenarios; particularly the latter? They'd be relying almost exclusively on novelty, which I don't think has much longevity. I suppose the argument could be made that people are going to pump-and-dump altcoins for eternity, but like I said, I think people are going to lose interest in doing that as cryptocurrency starts to become more of a household name.

I see this said all the time and it just isn't true. Bitcoin can be used as a store of value with no issue, all the while being practically impossible to confiscate. People who hold gold are indeed using gold.
Please don't mistake this as a comment saying that bitcoin has been a *good* store of value for the past 12mo, simply that its scarce nature makes it feasible to be used as a store of value.

@_date: 2014-02-11 21:50:39
Where did I say any of that was good? In fact, I think I said close to the opposite. What I don't understand is how you think an invention like this is "supposed" to permeate society.

@_date: 2014-05-14 06:28:29


I've thought something similar before. My thought was more that altcoins would fill that role, but if things like side/tree chains are feasible then I'd imagine they'd see some use.
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:03:53
I think a big portion of what's caused a hesitation in development is that even a hardware wallet is still too cumbersome for the average person at this point. If you're looking at day-to-day transactions, you have to compare a potential offering to the incumbent, which in this case, is credit/debit cards. For POS interactions, credit/debit cards work pretty well.
I imagine this fact is probably going to drive people toward more centralized services (Circle comes to mind), but perhaps only for the short term. As the tools available to control your own finances become more developed, user-friendly, secure, etc., we may see a migration away from the outsourcing of responsibility.
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:23:16
I agree. When I first heard about bitcoin, I was skeptical. I think it's something people *ought* to be skeptical of.

In a sentence, Neo is the first institution where people can use and benefit from the bitcoin ecosystem without having to be especially tech savvy or computer literate. Some like to call it a bitcoin bank. This isn't entirely accurate as Neo doesn't do lending or fractional reserve. At this stage, they are acting as an exchange and hosted wallet service.
Bee is the payment network associated with Neo (think of it as their take on Visa/MC). Customers who open a Neo account receive a Bee card they can use at merchants utilizing a Bee payment terminal.

Here's my issue with these types of arguments: how are you certain that buyer protection is something bitcoin will always be lacking? There's some great stuff on the horizon in this industry which may make things like our current approach to consumer protection look laughably inefficient.
I just don't understand this almost inability to see how the offering of today is not the offering of tomorrow, and an inability to see how such changes could happen doesn't preclude them from happening.
If we went forward with the "well, I've no idea how to fix that" or "well, it's not instantly obvious how we fix that" mindset, we'd never have left the cave.

Bitcoin is most certainly valuable. To disagree is borderline ridiculous. Bitcoin allows, for the first time in history, near instantaneous value transfer over the internet without a third party.
Now, if you don't personally find that valuable, that's fine. But many people do. And what's considered to be valuable is a collective assessment of society, not just you.

Great points.
Regarding the figure for denoting a saturation point, doesn't it stand to reason that the industries with the highest end-user cost and most friction would be some of the best places for development (remittances, etc)? Demand would seem highest for those use cases.
If that's the case, then the saturation point really could be 5B+. I think envisioning a saturation point of just the OECD population would be on the conservative side.
I'm with you in seeing 200x growth in two years as hopelessly unrealistic, though.

It seems one group wants it to be accessible and affordable for *everyone*, and the other group doesn't much care if it works out that way. There's enough utility there, that it will find its place regardless whether the average person has access/can afford it.

You're confusing the IPVO price with the total dividend.
Up until 24 Feb. 2014, you were able to buy shares at IPVO price (0.003btc/share) on lmb-holdings.com. After that date, the IPVO closed and the shares traded exclusively on the open market and that's why you're seeing the higher price.
The 0.0035 figure is the total dividend anyone holding public shares is set to receive once Neo becomes profitable (0.0035btc/share).
Hope this helps!

You're misunderstanding what is saying. Imagine I establish a company that states that I will store some item for you at a given value for a given period of time. If I then lose that item, you have recourse - you sue. We entered into a contract and I (the business) didn't uphold my end.


If the storage facility is a registered company, they are legally obligated to fulfill their terms of a contract. If something happens to bitcoins they held, the customer retains the right to pursue legal action against the company.

Yes, yes I do. My internet (standard consumer internet for my area - 25M down/5M up) can easily handle 6 phones/tablets/laptops for basic internet browsing. No problem whatsoever.

This isn't a zero sum game. The profit early adopters enjoy doesn't only come from the wealth of later adopters, but more from the increase in utility of the network as a whole, which can only come about *because* of early adopters.
People who stringently hold bitcoin right now have a vision for the future. And if bitcoin continues to succeed, they have a *better* vision of the future than other people, and will be rewarded for that. If I have a vision that fossil fuels are going to make a spectacular comeback, and I load up on Exxon and Shell stock, do I not deserve to be rewarded for my foresight? If your answer is no, I don't deserve that, then you have a problem with markets and the idea of risk/reward.
The people who had foresight and took early risks, who essentially made it all happen, deserve to be rewarded. The same can be said of a successful entreprenuer. But instead of building a company that generates some product or service, early adopters of bitcoin are *essential* for the utility of the network to increase. More things are possible with a higher valued bitcoin.

I'm not sure what you're arguing.
Are you saying bitcoin will fail for the reasons you stated? That bitcoin shouldn't exist? That bitcoin is a bad thing?
I'm looking at how this will play out in the real world. It's pretty simple:
We have a scarce resource. If people want to use that resource, they will be required to pay for it. If more people want to use that resource, they will be required to pay more for it.
If you're simply saying "well, that's unfair!" I'm not sure what to tell you. This is an entirely voluntary system. Use bitcoin if you find it beneficial, don't if you don't.
And how about we let everyone decide for themselves if they find this resource to be of value?

I think the notion of having a 'hot' wallet that contains an amount you're comfortable carrying around (similar to cash in your back pocket) and then a 'cold' wallet at home that holds a larger portion of your money is a pretty intuitive approach.

In bitcoin's case however, we see companies very much believing their *intranet* is going to compete with bitcoin's *internet* which I believe to be nonsense.
Keep in mind, I'm not saying that a company's intranet is therefore worthless to them, or not worth pursuing. Just that creating an intranet and thinking you're going to eclipse the internet is misguided.

The discussion shifts if you're talking about whether they ought to be making an ATM that requires that level of ID verification in the first place.


I agree. I believe Lamassu is also taking that strategy with their bill-dispensing stand.


No argument out of me. My point is simply that Robocoin has chosen to move forward with their business and as such, they want to remain in business. If you're discussing whether they *ought to* have gone for this strategy, as I mentioned, that's a legit criticism. But given that's the direction they've gone, I'm sure they're keen on staying out of jail. And as far as I can tell, when you order from Robocoin, you do have the option of choosing what ID verification avenues you have.
The Robocoin in Canada has different requirements from the ones in the US. I'm willing to bet you could order one from them with no ID verification capabilities, but they'd probably request a document acknowledging that the operator has done their due-diligence and that Robocoin wouldn't be liable if the operator were using it illegally.
@_date: 2015-05-29 03:49:10


Yeah, many can't articulate the differences, but almost all understand the differences. To most, a $100 bill is far more appealing than a credit card. As the saying goes, cash is king. 


The only real reason for this is because we've been in economic isolation from one another for basically our entire history. Once the developing world gets reliable, affordable, open internet access, this entire dynamic changes. It does nothing but add fricition to have multiple digital cash networks. 
The largest population isn't in China, it's Facebook. It's only a matter of time before most global economic activity is conducted online. And given that money brings with it an incredibly strong network effect, I see convergence rather than divergence.


Yep, this is a bummer. The best criticism I've heard about bitcoin is that it's a first-world solution to a third-world problem. It's our job to make it a solution for the bottom 75% as well.


Yes, I agree because of the qualifier. That said, I always try and look down the road a fair ways.

Those are two seperate issues. *Everyone* who held for the past year has lost money. That isn't a phenomenon confined to people who adopted bitcoin more recently.

In short, network effects are a bitch to overcome. That being said, nothing makes a migration away from bitcoin impossible. But given the amendable nature of (most) cryptocurrencies, it's almost certainly better to fix an existing system (bitcoin) than bootstrap a new one.
Bitcoin has the most development, the most secure blockchain, the most established "brand", the most merchants, and the most users. If we're talking about competing cryptocurrencies, the question is more "why **shouldn't** I use bitcoin?"

I think the SwC UI is borderline un-usable, so you'll get no disagreement out of me there. It looks like a total hack job.
That said, their most attractive aspect is the ease of sign up. I don't have to provide an identity or even an email. I understand the risk of collusion and multi-accounting, but I think these problems should be solved at the software level rather than requiring social media login and identity attaching. Are there no collusion detecting algorithms that are *good enough*?
I've been of the mindset that online gaming is a great use case for bitcoin. And seeing the relative success of SwC, I've imagined that anyone who can make a competitor with a UI that was given more than 5min of thought could immediately stand out.

That quote is following the same misguided sentiment we've seen for some time now. That a blockchain is somehow valuable independent of the underlying token or asset.

This doesn't exactly follow.
If there's a limited capacity to interact with the network that enables consumers to save (among other things bitcoin could promise), and there are more people who want to interact than there is capacity for interaction, then interactions will command a premium.
This limited capacity may not become practically apparent for quite some time, but if it's inherently limited, and demand grows...well, the price *will* increase.

I don't think the average person in Seattle *should* care about bitcoin right now. Or rather, I'm skeptical of a good reason for why they should outside of ideology or political philosophies. Most people in Seattle have internet access, a bank account (which they're most like happy enough with), and a full portfolio of available financial services.
I've long thought that Average Joe in the developed world doesn't have much reason to be interested in bitcoin. I think they eventually will, but not before the innovators of the developed world build things. As it stands, bitcoin should appeal to innovative/entreprenurial people and the bottom 6 billion. The innovators already know about it and are involved. The bottom 6 billion haven't heard the word before.

I think this is the aspect that puzzles most people. Because if we're talking about a smartphone mining a half dozen satoshis everyday, how beneficial is the mining aspect anyway? The chip could come pre-loaded with 1 million satoshis making it capable of transacting thousands of times for various reasons, but if you're going to pre-load it with value, why make it mine?
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:25:52
Oh, I agree. It's not a great situation, but we have evidence that people *will* take action.
It's in the pool operators best interest to play by the rules. But yes, keeping mining decentralized is a big deal, for sure. I think if we can somehow get people to actually use something like P2Pool, that would be a step in the right direction.
That said, this isn't a problem that keeps me up at night.

In that case it probably makes sense to specify dollars instead of saying fiat currency as that gives the illusion you're comparing bitcoin to all fiat in general.

I think there's good reason to believe that when it comes to money, people tend toward a single type. From the network standpoint, it makes sense. The less we have to exchange one form of money for another, the better. Unless you're missing out on certain desirable functionality using Crypto A vs. Crypto B, I can't think of a reason to have many different types. 
Now if there's something that comes along that's simply better at being money than bitcoin, so be it. I don't think a coordinated "attack" from bitcoiners is going to be enough to actually suppress something that superior.
That said, outside of Monero, I don't see anything remotely on the horizon that's capable of dethroning bitcoin. That's not to say it can't happen, but at this point I think it makes most sense to charge forward with bitcoin. It's *good enough* to warrant building on.

I don't think so. It's the fact that a bitcoin being worth $13k is entirely possible even in that short of a timeframe. But there are people who seem to genuinely get angry about the prospect of that.
For a lot of things, when people voice some ludicrous prediction, most don't bat an eye. "The world is going to end in 2012!!" is met with "...yeah, ok pal"
But not with bitcoin. It elicits a much stronger reaction from people. Not exactly sure why.

I see people say this and I have to just shake my head.
I mean, what do you expect? This isn't a technology like Twitter where the cost of jumping on board is a 30sec of your time. We're talking about *money* here. The thing literally everyone on the planet is in pursuit of. Making significant changes to this isn't going to be an easy pill for people to swallow. That also doesn't mean that it's doomed to fail, that it's a bad idea, that it isn't worth pursuing, etc. It just requires patience and an understanding of what's being tackled here.
This idea that because we're in a post-internet age every new, valuable thing should sweep through like Twitter or Uber is totally unfounded. Bitcoin is aiming to be a foundation for a new way of looking and dealing with arguably *the most important* social construct in peoples' lives.
I live in a major tech city in the United States and I still comes across people a couple times each month who have never *heard* the word 'bitcoin' before. You seem to be under the impression that everyone (and I mean globally everyone) understands what bitcoin *actually* is, and rejects it as a technology void of significant value.
It's a stance that's completely disconnected from reality. The idea that even 1% of the globe has a factual understanding of bitcoin and its implications is laughable. And yet you're calling the thing unsuccessful. If there's any moment where 'LOL' is appropriate, it's here.

That's a fair point, though I think the real question is: is the blockchain decentralized *enough*?
Most (if not all) engineering problems are a matter of finding what's *good enough* given the scope, budget, timeline, etc. How many nodes do we need for the network participants to accept that bitcoin is decentralized?
I know I myself would operate a full node at a small loss to help correct the problem. But you're right, there is a tragedy of the commons problem here.
I guess the question is: are there enough people like me (people who would run a full node at a loss just to help the network) to keep bitcoin sufficiently decentralized? My intuition is that the answer is yes.

You still haven't put forth an argument for why people wouldn't choose an inflationary altcoin. Why not just leave bitcoin capped to serve as an instrument for storing wealth and use an altcoin with an inflation schedule for day-to-day commerce?

Consider mining out of the question unless you have access to a ton (millions) of capital. If you're not worried on seeing an ROI, then consider mining as an education or small effort to help keep the network decentralized. Also consider running one or more full nodes if you decide against mining.
In general, you have a good basis.
One small critique, bitcoin isn't exactly "encrypted" but rather is based on cryptographic principles.

First step is to get a wallet.
For a PC/laptop, check out Electrum.
For an android smartphone, check out Copay or Mycelium.
For an iPhone, check out Copay or breadwallet.
For a hardware wallet (which is a separate dedicated device), check out Trezor or Ledger Wallet.
You can get your first bitcoins by selling goods/services for them, or buy them on Coinbase or Circle.

Also, regarding your idea that most of the world uses the iPhone 4, [here's a bunch of data]( that directly contradicts that notion.

There are two established hardware wallets out right now - [Trezor]( and [Ledger](
There are also two others ([Case]( and [KeepKey]( but neither are shipping yet.
The consequences of storing bitcoins on your smartphone is that you run the risk of coming across some piece of malware that could potentially extract your private key from the device. In case you don't know, control of the private key is what gives you control of the bitcoin at a given address.
Your smartphone is constantly communicating with various networks and mobile wallets like Mycelium are known as 'hot wallets'. In information security, the rule of thumb is that you want to limit the number of attack vectors to sensitive information. Hardware wallets accomplish this by removing many of the communication capabilities from the device. So private keys are generated on the device and are never broadcast or accessible from an external source.
It's good practice to assume that any computer (smartphones included) that's ever been connected to the internet is potentially compromised.
Hope this helps. Feel free to shoot any other questions my way.
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:01:28
Ah, I'm going to guess you didn't let it 'set' in the fridge.
If you make it with water and drink it right after mixing, it's a little rough. I didn't consider that because I only made that mistake once. 
I usually make a pouch at night and drink it the next day. It's *way* better if you leave it overnight in the fridge.

I'd wager no more than 5% of the global population has even heard the word 'bitcoin' before. If you want to talk about people who not only know the word, but also actually *understand* what it's about, what it enables, why it's powerful, etc. we're talking fractions of a percent.
Don't be under some misapprenhension that people understand, don't care, and therefore reject the technology. That mindset is totally inaccurate.


This is only looking at the problem from the POV of a developed nation. For much of the world, the idea of securing a financial service is a pipe dream. The people who are paying double digit percent fees to get money to their families couldn't give a shit what's trendy or flashy. This isn't a fashion show.


Well, I think the majority of operating systems currently in use are Linux-based. That may not be the case for end-user laptops/desktops, but that's absolutely the case for major computing infrastructure and mobile industries.
Of course closed-source projects generate some solid UX, but we pay for that. It just isn't monetary in nature. We pay for that by requiring worldwide discussions about privacy, security, and a general discomfort that we're being watched. The average person then asks 'well, what choice do I have?'. What you outlined may be the case currently, but we should be working to make sure that isn't the case in the future.


No one is saying this. They're saying a blockchain (as we currently understand it) can't work *without a value token* to incentivize sustainment of the system.
A government/corporation could certainly make Govcoin or VISAcoin, but it would 100% lack the openness and unrestricted access of Bitcoin. You may try and argue that doesn't matter, but I contend that matters a lot for enabling truly global interoperability.


The average person will care a lot when they actually understand there's a system that doesn't wield that kind of control. People already despise banks. But they use them because what other choice do they have? Unless they want to deal 100% in cash, they *have* to play by banking rules. Well...that's changing now.

He's lying.
If we call the summer 3 months long, making $20k would mean they'd have to mine ~80 bitcoins. That works out to mining ~1 bitcoin per day.
He would need a miner capable of about 100 TH/s in order to mine 1 bitcoin per day, which isn't a "casual" mining operation. Factor in electricity and hardware costs, and even if he does have a mining operation of that scale, he almost certainly isn't profiting figures like $20k, let alone multiple people doing so.
EDIT: As for the legality, mining bitcoin is perfectly legal.

From Wikipedia:
"As a CERN employee, Berners-Lee distributed a proposal on 12 March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web"
The overall point wasn't that bitcoin is somehow on-track with, or faster than, the internet in terms of consumer adoption, simply that your statement of 50% of Americans using the internet within five years was woefully inaccurate.


You should really stop attaching unfounded quantifications to your statements.
The US population in 1995 was ~266 million.
14% of that is ~37 million.
The total number of estimated bitcoin users is 5-10 million. So no, it isn't "hundred of times" more people. It's *at best* 10x more users in the same timeframe.
Also, the first killer app of the internet (email) was immediately useful to anyone with a computer and internet access. Bitcoin doesn't have that luxury. Most people in places with high internet penetration enjoy modern financial services that are usually *good enough*. There are exceptions, but I hope you're not insinutating that because bitcoin hasn't been adopted as quickly as the internet, that that's somehow indicative of looming failure.

Well, one problem is that the developers don't dictate anything. Further, many developers are of the very idealogically-driven group I initially mentioned. Most can get very high-paying jobs elsewhere and don't exactly need to compromise on their ideals.
I'm skeptical "the masses" will be attacking anyone. If devs get any pushback, it will be from special interests, not Mom and Pop.
Those special interests are more than welcome to develop Fedcoin or Inflationcoin or whatever else. My point is that *bitcoin* is very unlikely to undergo a protocol change to remove the hard-cap.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:31:14
Man, accusations out in force today.


Please point to where this was said. Saying bitcoin hasn't changed in the way it operates is beyond absurd. The protocol has had north of 100 improvement proposals, with many being merged into the core client.
If you're refering to the way the protocol works at a base level, well....yeah, that makes sense for it to not change much. You could point the same finger at the internet and say: "See! It's hardly changed because it still just routes packets across the network"

Hardware wallets are arguably the *safest* place to store bitcoins, with Trezor being on of the most respected and vetted hardware wallets around.
There are always dangers but as long as you keep your backup seed safe and remember your PIN, you're about as secure as possible.

How about it's wrong because it's abject theft? And "could be used" by wealthy interests? You mean *is used*.
I also disagree that on their own they aren't inherently wrong. I suppose we have different value sets.
As I mentioned, the problem of wealth inequality isn't solvable *as long as* people are able to act as free economic actors. This doesn't even touch on the pure fantasy of trying to equally distribute wealth.

What I meant by delaying adoption is that, like you said, one needs to put money at stake to use bitcoin. Many people aren't currently comfortable with that, so they don't buy any. Now, as more people do decide to take that risk and this early concern that the value could at any second drop to zero goes away, confidence in the system increases. As general confidence increases, people won't feel like the risk is as pronounced.
Use cases for bitcoin will continue to come about and mature. I imagine slowly (and then at some point probably very quickly) people will start to migrate to it for any number of reasons from wealth preservation to international purchasing to black market activity.
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:54:08

Where the two lines meet in the center is the current market price. The slope of the green and red lines indicate how much money it would take to move the price a given amount through a market buy or market sell order.
A steeper line indicates it would take more money to move the price a given amount, and a flatter line means it would take less money to move the price the same amount.
When you see a vertical line, that's called a "wall". It means that the wall has to be "eaten" in order to move the price past the price point the wall is at. For example, there's a buy wall at $286 in your screencap. Buy walls provide price support (harder to drop price past the wall). Sell walls do the opposite (there's a small sell wall at $290.XX), they make it harder to increase the price.
Keep in mind that these slopes/walls change with time and they only reflect how things would happen the minute a market buy/market sell order occurs. Large market orders usually have the downside of bringing (sometimes) significant [slippage](

I guess it depends on what you mean by mass adoption.
I'm not convinced that in order for bitcoin to be considered "successful" it must capture the day-to-day payments market. I think it has the potential to do that, and it'd be awesome if it did, but I'm not sure it needs to.
The places with low financial access, however, have much more incentive to adopt something like bitcoin. It's less likely to have many of the jurisdictional limitations that plague much of the existing e-commerce industry.

Never was bitcoin argued to solve the issue of wealth disparity. Nothing will solve that assuming you allow people to be independent economic actors. Even starting with perfectly equal wealth distribution, certain people will make better economic decisions than others and begin amassing more than their initial portion. After not too long, you have the top 1% owning the majority of wealth.
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:54:39


Absolutely. There's no question that bitcoin's monetary nature changes the discussion.
That said, the *way* this changes things, IMO, is through delay of adoption. People want to see more demonstration, more use, more coverage, etc. before they'll throw in with a system like this. They want to see other people using it and *not* get screwed. And they want to see this repeatedly.
But at the end of the day, it's a *better* system in almost every way. Email was the same. Now, email took a little while to take hold because the internet itself was somewhat new. Bitcoin is coming in on top of a much more mature internet, so information spreads faster.
In comparing adoption between email and bitcoin, I think the question comes down to this:
Does the delay that Bitcoin faces as a result of being monetary in nature trump the speed at which it spreads due to more widespread internet access?

I'm still kind of torn on whether I classify bitcoin as a currency. It certainly can act as one, but I'm not comfortable leaving that as its only moniker.
If you just look at the currency-like aspect of it, I'd wager that there *isn't* another currency that's experienced reverse debasement. Some could probably argue gold experienced this (or at least could), but not any fiat currency. Too many fun control levers for governments to mess with.

Can you expand on this? As I understand it, the payment channel that's opened up between the two parties allows the recipient of the IOU to "cash it in" any time they like (up to a certain date). If the original recipient then wants to send money back to the original sender, the terms of the IOU are updated with a shorter timescale for redemption, and it's sent back to the original sender with the original recipient's signature.
Where's the risk?
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:17:52


The first two Amazon certainly has a leg up on OB, no doubt. Buyer/seller protection is built into OB in the form of a notary who controls one of the the 3 keys. There is also a market of sorts for notaries, so neither buyer nor seller is stuck with a given notary.
Listen, you're comparing some software that's still in *beta* to the second largest e-commerce company on the planet. Let's all just calm down a bit.


OB has openly stated that, as of right now, there is no annonymity provided by the software. That may change in the future, but they're not gunning for the black market right now (if ever)
Here's the value proposition:
[Amazon is only available in 10 countries]( and if you're not lucky enough to be in one of those locations, you're practically shut off from any kind of global marketplace. OB allows anyone with internet access, anywhere on the planet, the ability to interact with global customers.
If you don't see immense value in that, I'm not sure what to tell you.

In my opinion, that's a fairy tale.
Why would you think that after a catastrophic price decline, the price would steadily rise and we'd be immune from volatility? Do understand that the volatilty comes from the fact that bitcoin as a currency market is exceptionally illiquid. Any time someone makes a large move into or out of bitcoin, the price moves all over the place. So we have this effect where people with relatively small amounts of money (small in the global market sense) can make appreciable impacts on the price.
Also, there isn't anything wrong with people speculating on bitcoin as a means of making a profit. I'm not sure why people see that as a negative. Sure, it causes volatility, but as the saying goes: "That's the way she goes, Bubbs".

But the point of a blockchain is to establish consensus amongst untrusted parties.
This doesn't accomplish that. If everyone is trusted, I'm not seeing the advantage of a blockchain over a traditional central database.

Alright, I've heard this same sentiment enough without much substantiation, so I'll ask you:
Can you provide a detailed explanation of how such a system would function? You are saying you're able to retain the blockchain and do away with the associated token. I'm interested in seeing exactly how that works.

From their FAQ:






That's all fine, but what I don't understand is how or why this is preferrable to a standard wallet. They're selling the idea that this bit of hardware enables people to "sell digital goods and services" and get paid in bitcoin. But I can accomplish the same thing by downloading a free wallet.
I'm not seeing the value of a dedicated piece of hardware (nevermind the steep price tag) to the end-user aside from the fact it can also act as a full node.
Anyone have further insight?
For visibility, this is the best explanation/clarification I've seen (courtesy of &gt;Yes, 21s product does mine. No, it does not mine as a commodity business might, in fact it might be the first product ever not to. Instead, the mining is a way to easily acquire a miniscule amount of Bitcoin with no configuration. Yes, this means it is horribly inefficient compared to commodity mining, but that's not the point.
The point is that you can get into the microtransacting, digital Bitcoin economy doing nothing more than plugging in a power socket and a USB cable. From there, it's much easier to set about buying/selling digital goods like blog posts or media files or whatever then if you've already exhausted your mental energy and tolerance for screwing around figuring out Bitcoin in the first place. It doesn't even matter if the mining is losing money, this device is not supposed to make money mining. It's supposed to lose money, but have the difference made up by the convenience of connecting into the Bitcoin network's commercial opportunities.
This is also not the consumer version, that'll be version 4, this is the bleeding edge experimental developer version where you still have to deal with the command line instead of a three button GUI.

I still contend that the vast majority of those who stand to really benefit from Bitcoin aren't even aware of its existence.
Once the internet is widely available and affordable in developing areas, I think things could get interesting. Right now the people who know about Bitcoin (the developed world) don't *need* it the way developing areas do.
All that said, I live in a tech city in a developed country and I still talk to people under the age of 40 who have never heard the word 'Bitcoin' before.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:34:29
This is exactly what I'm looking to see a proper answer to. Every attempt at a response that I've heard is full of buzzwords that don't seem to really say anything at all. That, or they have different definitions of what a blockchain is, for example.

Well, not ad hominem as I'm not attacking anything about your character. You're probably a nice person.
It makes sense that we'd try to get people involved that are close to us, but I don't think we can make the statement that public interest is "minimal". Because globally speaking, the public doesn't even know about bitcoin.
I think it also makes sense that the developed world would lag in adopting bitcoin. The majority don't feel the pain of lacking financial access. The fact we see the migration we do is hugely bullish to me. I can't help but imagine what people who really *need* this are going to think when they wrap their minds around it.

That's not exactly clear for some of these companies at this point. It appears to be en vogue to like the "blockchain technology" but also in the same breath, detract from bitcoin the currency.
I personally think these two ideas are at odds. If they're using another blockchain, well, they now have themselves an altcoin, and  those don't exactly have a great track record.
In general, I think the successful ones will use the bitcoin blockchain.

Most places will not accept gold in exchange for goods/services either.
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:10:44
Most of the above points can still be accomplished without a blockchain using redundancy. You can have client-side copies of the database that 'phone home' at some interval, sure. But if there's a central point where trust is been sought, acquired, etc., then it's a centralized database. So regarding not wanting to maintain a central database...well, someone has to. Someone is running the show.
I ask this question honestly, why do you think the developers with the most experience in cryptocurrency reject the idea you're proposing? Do they just not know any better?

@_date: 2015-03-24 21:54:48
Yes, those people definitely exist.
I'm not about to try and predict all the various implications of a USD implosion, but we can make the asusmption that those with wealth stored outside the USD probably won't feel the full brunt of a USD collapse. I think the question now is: is that a reasonable assumption? I personally think so. But there are a lot of places 'outside the USD' to keep wealth, so this wouldn't be exclusive to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:13:32

I've been here for quite awhile and I don't think I've seen anyone say something like this. 
It's obviously beyond reason to think that the sheer existence of bitcoin will somehow make trading shares of public companies obsolete. Now, the platform on which shares of these companies are traded may in fact change, but the act itself won't.
@_date: 2015-03-07 21:32:43


Well, like I said, you can essentially look at the USD as what you just described above. It's already a digital currency, "mined" by banks, with government (mandated) traction.
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:29:45
Sure, all you need to do is create a wallet and then provide your customers with a payment address.
That's it.
As for wallets, you have a bunch of different options, but I'd recommend researching and using an HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet. Check out [Electrum]( [Armory]( and [Multibit HD](

@_date: 2015-11-12 23:03:17
The LocalTrader feature in the Mycelium app on android is a good choice. You can also try LocalBitcoins.
The other option is to offer some good or service in exchange for bitcoin.
Most other options have a sign-up process requiring some amount of identification.
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:44:39
But again, why the need for a blockchain if you're limiting the participants to only trusted individuals? Why not a shared, logged database?
@_date: 2015-10-26 06:07:56
Yes, by buying someone gold.
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:02:31
I largely agree with this.
The average person, even those with a basic understanding of Bitcoin, probably aren't aware of the block reward reduction schedule. Most know there's a limited supply, but probably not much past that.
That said, I expect to see some increased media attention on the halving as that date approaches.
@_date: 2015-10-26 05:58:33
Is there an aspect you'd like help with specifically?
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:02:18
Why is that bad?
Trying to pigeon-hole bitcoin under various labels (currency, commodity, stock, etc.) is missing the point, I feel. This is essentially an entirely new asset class. It's kind of whatever it's users want it to be. It can be used as a currency and it can be used as an investment.  The antics of one group will no doubt affect other groups, but that's the price of admission, so to speak.
@_date: 2015-10-26 19:09:32
It depends on your risk tolerance.
In general, people around here will recommend generating wallets offline. And yes, that's still a bit of a process if you do it manually. However, in my opinion, simply using a hardware wallet (like Trezor, Ledger, or KeepKey) is probably sufficient for the vast majority of people and they all have pretty straightforward setup processes. The downside is you have to buy the device.
There's two things you want to pay attention to:
1.) How was the key generated and where is it stored? If it was generated on a machine/device that's been connected to the internet, that exposes you to some risk. Hardware wallets kill two birds with one stone here in that keys are generated *and* stored on a device that has no internet exposure.
2.) Do you have backups?
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:13:37
Out of curiosity, which wallet did you decide on?
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:32:26


Why would this be the case?
@_date: 2015-03-10 08:35:20
That's the wrong answer :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:24:32
You can make whatever point you'd like, but you certainly can't say that rejecting the idea of centralized power leads to "pointlessness"

What's your point? I'd hope you're not saying that because something hasn't worked in the past, it won't (or can't) work in the future.
Most multi-faceted, technical challenges depend on a solution that's *good enough*. Between proof-of-burn, checklocktimeverify, security deposits of sorts, and web(s) of trust, I'm optimistic there's a workable solution in there somewhere.

Nope. That's not spoon-fed enough for OP.

Frankly, there's nothing wrong with that. If these people are in situations where they can afford to do such a thing, what ground do I have to say they're wrong?
I'd imagine most of those people are in their twenties, single, no kids, and work for paychecks they convert into bitcoins (or work directly for bitcoins). There's enough liquidity that if shit hit the fan and they wanted to jump ship, they can. They'd almost certainly realize a loss, but so what?

I don't think this involves change addresses (or at least to any greater degree than normal)
The refund transaction provides protection to Alice in case Bob is uncooperative for any reason. If she sends coins to a multisig address she controls with Bob, and Bob doesn't cooperate (for whatever reason), her coins are stuck. So the refund transaction executes if a given time has passed and Bob hasn't signed the transaction.

Fungibility isn't something you flip a switch to turn on. As far as I'm concerned, bitcoins are perfectly fungible at the moment. I'd be willing to trade any bitcoin I own for any other. I think a lot of people feel this way.
Better privacy will help ensure this stays true, but I'm not seeing what's so frustrating about the current state of things?

@_date: 2015-03-07 21:16:18
The two (bitcoin and bankcoin) are likely to be fundamentally different.
Unless the bank open-sources their coin and allows general mining, then it will simply be a centralized digital currency. But we already have that, it's called the dollar. And if they're willing to open the coin up, then what's the point in creating it in the first place? They'd be competing with bitcoin on *its own ground* and that's a battle they're unlikely to win.
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:06:46


This notion seems to be ignored, but it's spot on.
@_date: 2015-10-21 07:26:29
It really depends on how you define 'use'.
For example, are people holding physical gold actually *using* it? I'd argue yes. They're using it as a form of wealth preservation or speculation.
I imagine most people "using" bitcoin are using it in the same sense.

I value USD because of the value (food, shelter, water, luxuries) I can get in exchange for it. Period. The people giving me that value are willing to do the same and for the same reason. This doesn't have to be complicated. I'm not sure why you're so preoccupied with taxes. If you like, I can say part of the value I get from the USD is my freedom (as taxes could be seen as essentially purchasing freedom).

All the infrastructure - banks, armored cars, ATMs, etc. Plus the cost associated with currency being physically destroyed. Paper notes only last so long. You also have the issue counterfeiters becoming more sophisticated, so you have to constantly research new watermarks, dyes, inks, etc.
Everything from the industrial scale printing press to the paper bands used to wrap stacks of bills need to be accounted for if we're to compare apples to apples.

I'm fairly confident is asking the question in a philosophical sense. The answer being that all money is simply a universally shared delusion. These paper slips have value because other people value them.
That's it.
Now, part of that value can be looked at as stemming from the governments ability to put you in jail for failing to provide them enough of these paper slips every year. That's fine and well, but I don't think that's at the heart of what was being asked.

What I think most people don't understand is that that assurance is paid for, just in an abstract, behind-the-scenes sort of way.
People complain night and day about the misgivings of financial institutions, how they're predatory, etc. and yet many don't realize that this is a direct result of the trust model we use. People think that if we can just find the handful of people who won't abuse our trust, we'll be just fine. 
This is, at best, a flawed model. And at worst, it becomes outright criminal. Evidence of the latter isn't hard to muster and if history is any indicator, these hypothetical "morally pure" individuals simply don't exist.
The issue is essentially in telling people that there needs to be a systemic, foundational change in the way we do finance/financial services. People don't like the sound of that. And if you go a step farther and posit that you think you know of something that stands a chance at *actually* doing that, you're looked at like a crazy person.

I can say with almost 100% certainty that bitcoin will never change such a core principle as its fixed supply.
There are other altcoins that incorporate inflationary effects. If people desire those attributes, we'll see some migration to them.
I think most people in this sub reject the idea that inflation is the healthiest option for an economy. I'll agree that slight inflation is probably not a huge concern, but neither is slight deflation. In fact, I'd argue slight deflation to be healthier as it incentivizes careful spending and greater attention to product/service quality. But if your only measure for economic health is GDP, I can understand disagreeing. I, for one, don't see GDP as the end all, be all.
The extremes of either can have negative consequences, but I don't know that bitcoin's deflation would ever become extreme.


The idea is that as transaction volume increases there comes a point where transaction fees make up a larger percentage of a miner's income than the block reward. If volume is high enough, we can keep low fees as miners make up on high volume.

The tough thing about answering these questions is that you're trying to give an answer to someone most likely from the Western World. In comparison to what's in place in the US and western Europe, there aren't substantial gains to be had in using bitcoin as a transactional currency.
The gains will initially mostly be seen when dealing on an international basis or when dealing with emerging economies. I think the benefits seen in the Western World will be smaller by comparison

They are not centralizing bitcoin. The goal is to remove/reduce the barrier-to-entry for non-technical people.

For example, say I use armory offline and my offline computer burns in a fire and then armory as a company/source of support, falls off the face of the planet. If I still remember my seed, can I always rebuild this wallet regardless of what's happened to the company? Or am I needing armory to continue to be around in order to rebuild my wallet?

This isn't "bigger than April". If you're only looking at price, then yes, it's higher than April, but in terms of a percent increase, we're not even close.
Using Bitstamp prices, the April run up went from roughly 1 Jan. 2013 - 8 Apr. 2013. In that time it increased ~1600% ($13 to $229). It then roughly stabilized to ~$115 (770% gain).
If we're truly in a bubble equivalent in magnitude to April, and we set a rough date for the beginning of the "run up" at 1 Oct. 2013, then a 1600% gain would take us over $2k.

I guess it depends on the definition of 'en masse', but look how quickly something like FB or Twitter grew. I was using FB in 2004 when you needed a .edu email to sign up. Here we are, almost 10yrs later and FB has been completely ubiquitous in the developed world for a number of years. I think Twitter grew even faster, gaining *half a billion* users in 6 years.

The use of bitcoin as a transactional currency is hands down its least mature use case. That really shouldn't surprise anyone as it's what will take the longest time to develop.
It doesn't mean that no one is working to change that or people are only looking to speculate. The point is that bitcoin draws people in for a wide variety of different reasons. You're not shitty or "un-true" to bitcoin for not wanting to use it in a certain manner.

As for your last point, I completely agree. Bitcoin has already installed itself as a rosebud in the global economy's underwear.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:55:51
Insightful and well stated. It will certainly be interesting to see how this landscape evolves. I'm wondering how substantial this "smart fee" idea that's been brought up by the developers will be if it actually gets implemented.
As you said, which I'm inclined to agree with, we still have ample room for growth before friction of this kind is really felt. The optimist in me says we'll have the time to consider the implications of a potential clash in ideology and we'll prepare for it.

Alright, let's all take it easy...
You can't possibly be trying to say you're a solid representation of your age group. You very well may be one of a dozen people over 60 who operate bitcoin mining machines, let alone one who operated it as far back as 2011. Noel20 is right in a lot of respects: the entire idea surrounding bitcoin is extremely hard for even fairly technically-minded, young people to grasp. It isn't disingenuous to say that the vast majority of those over 55 haven't a clue what bitcoin is.
I don't think he was displaying ageism.

I'm wondering if you're aware that this is a currency and payment network that was literally worth nothing five years ago. Imagine inventing this and then trying to convince the first person that they should be willing to equate it to money. You can't expect things like this to develop and mature overnight.
I'm fairly certain coinmap is only (or mostly) brick and mortar locations accepting bitcoin. This doesn't mean there isn't a bitcoin economy. In fact, there's a staggeringly large one considering its age.

I'm torn on this. On the one hand, I appreciate the fact that bitcoin can, in a sense, circumvent The Man. On the other hand, gaining widespread adoption is very difficult if people have to go against the Grain of Regulation.

For someone who, I believe, has expressed a positive sentiment toward bitcoin as a technology, you sure are dedicated to trying to make your contribution on here as negative as possible. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:00:43
That's true. But so what? All that does is isolate the US from innovating in the bitcoin space.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:34:08
To be honest, I don't. 
Saying something like bitcoin could turn out to be useless is pretty ignorant, I'm sorry to say. You can make the case that it may not see mainstream adoption, but the one thing you *can't* say is that it could become useless. At least not at this point in time, anyway. The utility of bitcoin is literally the *only* thing valuable about it. And unless something is developed that trumps that utility, there's ZERO chance it will be classified as useless.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:09:41
I agree that's a pretty asinine prediction.

Very well said.
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:51:12
Nothing stops them from doing that.
You can make the argument that they'd see higher adoption due to their existing network/marketing reach, which may very well be true, but in order for anyone to really buy into the idea from an ideological standpoint, they (Apple/Google/MC/etc) couldn't make up more than 25% of the network (assuming they're hashing their coin themselves) before people started to get concerned.
It's much easier to trust a coin that isn't explicitly tied to a registered corporation.

The issue for altcoins is that they need to bring something new to the table *that bitcoin isn't able to incorporate.* That's really the detail that dooms the majority of altcoins.

You're still right. Inflation is increasing money supply which has the effect of decreasing purchasing power.

Bingo. The kind of thing we're seeing regarding the price is entirely to be expected. Information doesn't travel in a nice linear manner.

Good question.
Asking may be the only avenue unless someone comes up with a way of checking.

Because it'd be evidence of a high and abrupt adoption rate. People would be falling all over themselves trying to buy bitcoins.

You can't avoid the price fluctuations as that's just the market doing its thing. The thing you can avoid is the mental anguish of seeing your bitcoin as the hostage of it's corresponding value in USD.
Bitcoin is a currency, sure, but that's only a single use case. You can look at bitcoin as a simple digital asset. The standard narrative is that this asset is a currency...but it isn't relegated to *only* a currency. Just as stated, the price of bitcoin in USD is boring when you consider the fact that anything that could be considered an asset - the deed to a house, title to a car, shares of a stock, etc., can be held and represented in the bitcoin blockchain, the implications are mind-boggling.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:00:45

Disagree. Substitute GPU for ASIC in the above, and you'd have the same argument from CPU miners a year or two ago. ASICs will continually come down in cost and be more and more affordable to the masses.

What I mean is, on the Ask side I see four distinct lines ranging from near black to bright red. I see the same on the Bid side, but they're all on top of one another. What is happening that causes the lines to stagger, or drift away, from each other.

I don't think this is correct. All translations have noted that this is confined to financial institutions and payment institutions. Says nothing about regular merchants.

It just has to be determined which is a less costly scenario - fix bitcoin or switch to an alt.
Just because a flaw is found doesn't mean it's automatically better to switch to an alt.

It'd be fairly unwise for the next cryptocurrency to not build on the last stable point of the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin has already laid the ground work and to start from scratch when you don't need to doesn't make a lot of sense.

Hi Danny, I'm wondering about dividends and how they'll pay after fulfillment of the 0.0035BTC/share. Is it just a decreased percentage?

Best of luck!

You need a buyer in order to sell.
What makes you think the early adopters will be able to find a buyer for their plethora of coins? Perhaps they could sell them all off, but they won't be able to do it quickly. If they tried, doesn't it stand to reason that they would be driving the price down and ultimately screwing themselves on the later stages of the 'dump'?
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:19:46

The opportunity cost is the same. Whether you use fiat to pay for that sandwich or you use bitcoin, if you buy more bitcoin with the fiat you would've spent on the sandwich, you're in the same exact spot.
*By definition* if you're spending fiat on something when you could've used the fiat to buy bitcoin, you're "losing out" on value all the same. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:08:19
I don't mean to sound rude, but you're asking people to predict the future for you. What makes you think that's a reasonable thing to ask?
Bitcoin could go up; bitcoin could go down. There is high risk here. If you understand and believe in the fundamentals of bitcoin, then feel free to plug some money in. If you don't, don't.

The idea that you can't have both at the same time may be true, but surely there would be a transition period from speculative investment to currency.
It's stands to reason that due to bitcoin's age, we're still discovering its price. This almost *by definition* results in volatility. As that price is increasingly discovered and well-known, the transition into currency can really pick up steam.
But there will always be at least some marginal tension between people viewing it as an investment and those viewing it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:28:32


The fundamental of bitcoin that can never go away is the theory and practical application, both of which have already been realized. The genie is out of the bottle and has, thus far, been shown to work as designed.
As for guaranteed exchanges, I'm sure you're aware this technology is 5 years old. How about a little patience? Here we have world-changing tech and people are wondering why the use, infrastructure, and consensus isn't on par with the something that's been around 5000+ years.

They offer accounts pegged to the Euro which serve to isolate the customer from price fluctuations. For example, if you deposit 100EUR, those euros are converted to bitcoin and if the exchange rate goes up, Neo keeps the remainder, and if the rate goes down, Neo will top up the account so there is always the equivalent of 100EUR worth of bitcoin in the account.

There's no getting around the fact that you likely payed a fat markup. It no doubt costs money to mint these, but the price is still a little excessive.
