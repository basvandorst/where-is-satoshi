They're just cheap bastards... But that's who we want. People in general are simply not going to pay to run full nodes on dedicated modern hardware.. They're going to run it on an old laptop with a broken screen or an RPI or a cheap vps. The other issue is that processing transactions takes time.. In order for someone to start a node and have it catch up takes hours.. If it starts taking days that's a problem.. Also bandwidth for relaying the transactions also starts to be an issue.. And that's for a measely 1x increase.. We need to scale bitcoin by hundreds if not thousands of times. It can be done without hardforking or creating any new load on the nodes.. It just involves higher level protocols like ln and drive chains/side chains.

IMO they hope there won't be one but can't just say nothing, so this is the simplest.

Yes but I don't think its a random number.. Maybe a script hash of the op_true opcode or something.

Kind of.. Bigger blocks will make it expensive to run a full node.. Pretty soon nobody will be running them except for exchanges and miners... The smaller community can also then more easily make other changes as its now much more centralized. There is also the issue that any block size increase is not backwards compatible with existing bitcoin nodes so either everyone agrees to upgrade at once (never gonna happen) or else the original old small block chain will run in parallel with the new big block one. This leads to brand dillution and confusion.

No, but you would not legally be able to sell more than 2.5k of BTC in one transaction. There may well be other rules that prevent you from doing several related transactions. Similar rules are being rolled out around the world.. In the UK if you want to conduct cash transactions larger than 10k you are required to register with the govt.. I imagine such registration has some obligations you must agree too (is probably some kyc aml stuff)

All of it.. Then max out all your credit cards and see if they'll give you a loan. If you have a house you should sell it and move into a tent.. It'll be worth it in the long run.

I guess if any peer attempts to relay a block that is part of a history including a 2mb block then that peer would be disconnected.

Does anyone know what bitcoin address segwit transactions will appear to be at on legacy nodes?
Edit: might be  which is the address to op_true
Edit: actually I suppose the address also needs to be a hash of the real segwitness too, so there would have to be more data not just a single op_true
