How Much Bitcoin Transaction Fees Should You Pay For Confirmed Transaction?
How Is Bitcoin Transaction Fee Decided?
On Bitcoin’s blockchain, the transaction fee is decided by the free market forces.
Free market forces mean anyone is free to set their own transaction fee and can send transactions. In a way it is good but it has its disadvantages too when you have less space.
By less space I mean the blocks of Bitcoin are only as big as 1 MB which means it can take only those many transactions in total. And on average, a BTC transaction is 230-250 bytes in size which in turn means it can accommodate only 4194 to 4559 transactions in the 1 MB block size.
We all know that miners who are incentivized by the Bitcoin network in the form of block rewards plus the transaction fee are naturally inclined towards maximizing their profits.
They can maximize their profits in two ways:
By getting more block rewards by finding more blocks
By including those transactions in a 1 MB block that pays them more fees

Hi DelfinGuy
Please do not call Crypto Day Traders - fools, respect their decision as Crypto Day Trader. We have Crypto Traders that BUY AND HOLD while others are Crypto Day Traders, trading on a daily basis on short term waves as intraday Crypto Traders.
