How does bitcoin expand its adoption base with your kind of attitude? We need everyone to get on board to make bitcoin successful.

Over 60% of BTC trading volume is in Chinese Yuan.

US dollar is the mandate money. Bitcoin is the money by people's free will. That is why "If you don't like here go away" is detrimental to bitcoin's adoption. Dogecoin community is smart enough to realize that.

Bitcoiners from Huobi selling bitcoins to buy litecoins.

Unfortunately, we in US cannot treat bitcoin anyway we want. The tax man has already spoken.

If it is true, why haven't the Chinese banks notified the BTC exchanges their bank accounts will be closed? It just doesn't fit logic.

It is not Coinbase's fault. Coinbase cannot keep fiat. They can only hold Bitcoins. Holding customers' money requires a lot more licenses and will get a lot more regulators' scrutiny. So does Circle, no holding of customers's fiat money.

As long as Chinese stock market keeps going up (up 30% in the last 2 months), BTC price will keep going down. Chinese speculators are pulling money out of Bitcoin to chase their stock market.  Considering over 70% of daily Bitcoin trading volume is from China, this impact is much bigger than all the good news. Lobby the US government to relax the regulations, that is what we all should do now. Write to your congressman, we need friends in Washington.

Have you used Huobi before? If not, your comment may not be fair. Huobi has been charging 0% fee for bitcoin trading for months. They added litecoin lately. Naturally charge 0% for trading too. I have a friend who has a Huobi account since 12/2013.  She has no issues with trading, deposit/withdraw bitcoin or Chinese yuan.

Majority of people don't want to trust themselves. They would rather entrust a regulated entity to hold their money. Bitcoin community should learn from this experience. We need regulated companies like Coinbase to spread adoption. Coinbase may not be the company for tech savvy bitcoiners. It is definitely a place for beginners and people who rather trust others than themselves.

I wonder why nobody is doing the arbitrage. Existing BIT shareholders can sell their shares at more than double of NAV and buy at Grayscale at NAV. Only downside is they have to hold another year.

I am sorry for the loss Luke Dashjr suffered. But I am surprised he needs donations for this kind of relatively minor repair. He must have sold his bitcoins way too early. That just tells you how much faith he has in bitcoin. I wonder how many core Devs out there no longer hold bitcoins. I would take any non-bitcoin holder's opinion with a grain of salt.

I bought Apple stock at $1 (split adjusted) in 1994. I sold it shortly after because everyone told me Apple was a fad. PC was going to crush Apple like a grape. Do your own homework. Don't listen to others. If you don't have faith, just sell and move on. I am convinced Bitcoin is here to stay. So I plan to hold it for at least 5 years. That is just me. You make your own decision.

Most people are not tech savvy enough to handle their own digital wallets. Unless you want Bitcoin to remain as geek only money, you should appreciate and support Coinbase and Circle's effort to spread mass adoption. Just try to tell your grandmom to creat a Bitcoin wallet herself, you will know what I mean.

Person to person bitcoin transfer via nickname or email address. I guess you have to maintain a registry of nicknames/emails to bitcoin addresses. Similar to DNS. Has to be as simple as sending an email. Has to be simpler to use than changetip. Also it should not require sending bitcoin to a centralized location. Linking nickname/email is less intrusive than linking to social network id.
Edit:  I know what a lot of people here think. You tech savvy guys don't have to use this app. But for average people, they don't mind give their ids to banks. I bet they don't mind to give up a little privacy for convenience.  Maybe require an extra password or optional multi-sig to send money for security.
