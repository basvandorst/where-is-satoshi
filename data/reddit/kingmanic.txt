That's more the perception within the community of ever increasing value on units held. It keeps bitcoin from flowing freely because people are holding onto it to watch it increase in value.


I'm in the pool of analysts that worry about incoming disruption. Bitcoin isn't on our radar. Stuff like Apple Pay and google Pay are and Amazon in general. Because of the set up of bitcoin it's users tend to generate and hold more than the 3 mentioned which means it isn't really something that will compete with what a bank does. It's behaves more like a stock. If it get's popular we'd just buy/sell it. If it becomes an actual currency we'd hook it up to our convenient ATMs and the interact network. We are far more worried about Apple, Google and Amazon. Bit coin isn't in a place nor is it heading in a direction that would do anything to banks.
PS. Banks are in the business of connecting capital with people who need it. To disrupt that business you need a way to easily provide a market place where someone assess risk. You can imagine we'd worry more about big data like google stepping in providing the risk evaluation piece and the connection piece. Those things are missing from bitcoin and thus bitcoin doesn't endanger Banks.

I work at a bank. Bitcoin is a joke. What makes analysts worry is shit like what if Amazon offered financial services. Bitcoin is a curiosity limited by the insanity of it's most vocal supporters. The things you advocate is why bitcoin will never be more than a curiosity.
Ps. It has a lot of the traits of a ponzi scheme.
