In my city if you list a house for $500,000 multiple buyers will request to buy it.  Some people might not think its worth $500, so they offer $490.  A few people might think that it's perfect so they offer $525. Then the realtors will start negotiating until only one person buys it.
So - would it matter if there is a 2% premium to use crypto when the price can easily swing 5%? It just has to do with the ask and the offer.  Sure the house is listed at 3.5M, but they aren't going to turn down a $4M offer unless they have a better one in hand.

is it cheaper to send large sums of money with bitcoin than it is with etherium? Any guesses where the price crossover is?
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:38:11
I am guessing that the subject was "expensive".  You said that it cost you $40 to move money from your wallet to your wallet.  Your detractor is creating a hypothetical scenario - from zimbabwe to EU and doesn't specify a $ value.  It might be a good point but it was poorly and weakly carried out.

eh, the tar sands are a pretty decent counter argument.
And a honda civic burns its own weight in refined gasoline every 13k Miles.  CO2 is the main threat to our eco systems today and ICE cars produce way more CO2 over their lifetime.
Yeah, mining is gross.  But we mine everything.  At least an electric car has a chance at being recycled and the input amounts are a lot smaller than with ICE technology.

A company like BestBuy is going to have margins of 60-80% on their low cost and consumable products.  Some sales will ring through at 50% margin although the bigger ticket things like the Macbook Pro are going to be 3%.
That's about where the company that I am selling for now is.  I might get a weird order that has only high margin parts, but I am likely to sell them other gear at the same time dropping the average margin per sale down.
Did you know that apple was making north of 40% on ipads? That went down, recently, with the price.  But even the biggest companies can make a lot of money.
SBUX has pretty great sales margins as well, as you'd guess. selling mostly hot water.
Total net revenues	2,395.90	
		
Cost of sales including occupancy costs	1,071.50	
(55.28% gross margin - my math)
Numbers for public companies are just sitting out there in the SEC's 10K's.

the problem isn't with the coin.  In my opinion.  But if you developed a business model to bring the coin to businesses you introduce a slew of problems.  But there is no real competition because there is no profit doing it the best way possible.  If you go into a bank asking to start saving for retirement then they will not sell you free etfs, they will sell you their most expensive mutual fund. It doesn't matter what's better for you, you are the customer and they are the product.
I have never been in the enviable position of cannibalizing my own sales.  A sale is a sale, better than them finding it themselves online or getting a similar product from elsewhere.
My square at least was set and forget, and if I go back to being an entrepreneur I will let people send money to a wallet in exchange for goods and services.

house price should be 3x annual income, down payment should be 20%, savings rate should be 20% of annual income.  time to save for a down payment is 1.5 years, with all those assumptions.  not the sort of time line to be speculating with, buy some shitty 1% GIC's!
My problem is that no one wants to sell me a house for $360,000 so I am going to keep renting until the next earthquake or whatnot.  Lots of cash left over for btc is nice I guess.

invest in your self.  learn a desireable skill.  when you can save money from your paychecks diversify it away from fiat into stocks, real estate, bonds, crypto.  Cash has no value, but you need a crystal ball to know what the best play is, so just play everything of value.

Everytime you sell you are choosing an exit point, and everytime you buy you are choosing an entrance point.  You are correct that in a bull market it is pretty hard to fuck up the buy low sell high, because you are buying and then selling.
but people don't endlessly trade in an bull market, for one thing because they don't endlessly exist, but also because they are chasing alpha in a falling market.
Its hard to get a good entrance point though as well, the biggest upsides are the easiest to miss out on.  It would have taken a genius or an idiot (strictly luck) to buy coins at $13,000 and then you still have to choose you exit point.  Even looking back at that day, choosing 17,000 as an exit point would have been a good option, but why not get out at $15?
If you think bitcoin is going up, keep trading your time for something fungible, trade it for btc.  Spend less than you make, make as much as you can.  But imo, although fiat is trash btc isn't the most important investment.  First is your future, second is the land under you and then you can start picking and choosing between bond, stocks, gold, ethereum etc.  People have skipped the land step and gone straight to the moon, but other people have won the lottery.  don't do what works for others, do what'll work best for you.

gdax is an exchange.  BitCoin that are there are not yours, they are theirs.  Of course its in their best interest to not steal from their customers, but the value of bitcoin is that its your money.  Not the governments, not the banks.  Until you own the address someone else owns your coins.
Moving coins around costs money.  Want each coin to be worth $1M? at the December transactional costs that would have put a trade around $1000!  Want to buy a house? great, $1000 added to your purchase.  Want a sandwich? well shit, its going to cost another $1000.  This is a problem.  Fortunately, there are a lot of solutions, but segwit is a good one.  Lightning is another good one.  So if your wallet and your merchant support segwit you can do transfers for a lot less.

not 50% gross margin, after operations, but 50% margin per sale is pretty common.  Almost every etsy store is going to use that as a baseline for instance.  T-shirt shops are often way higher than 50%, I was getting shirts for $4, screen printing them and reselling them for $52.  Jewellry will be similar to that.
But generic cheap resold from alibaba? 50% margins all the way.

your heat comes from somewhere.  chemical energy, derived from the sun.  almost all energy comes from the sun.  but the earth sheds heat into space, so we are at an equilibrium.  If we were to better insulate the earth with CO2 the equilibrium temperature would rise.
Humans don't produce heat.  Trees growing and burning or growing and rotting don't produce different amounts of heat.  It is a cycle like the water cycle.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:50:50
Right, but if you have a business all set up most of your costs are fixed. More sales are beneficial. You aren't going to lose anything selling more product - even with a 20% depreciation.  If I wanted to sell my product on consignment the store would take 40% of the ticket price.  Customer acquisitions have a cost and a theoretical hit is better than many that I have seen.
But yes, if I were selling construction supplies I wouldn't expect my customers to be paying in bitcoin and the 10% margins would be easily demolished by currency swings before I could pay my suppliers. 
But for a site like reddit to not receive donations (literally all gold is) in bitcoin just shows how bad bitpay was.

and honestly a balanced portfolio will do exactly that.  If you have a quarter crypto, real estate, bonds, and stocks you are constantly selling high and buying low.
For instance if you had 10G in those four classes, and then one x4'd, you'd have 20G in each class after a rebalance.  Next month when it quarters you'd have 16.25G in each class.  
It feels weird buying stock when the P/E is so outta whack but I am not smart enough to make a better plan.

hmm, I thought that I made the argument pretty concisely already.  Bitcoin is better than fiat, but it needs to be adopted to be relevant.
Square has a business case for increasing bitcoin adoption.
the issues that you mentioned aren't really issues, they are some of the best parts of our current banking system.  More and more people are doing online banking which really has a lower cost of ownership than the big ol corporate banks.  Any bank is creating a simple user experience for moving money around.   Your third point confuses me, I would consider crypto pretty capitalist.

when I opened a bank account I had to do a credit check.  thats not really a big deal for banks.  But I can absolutely offer my buddy $10 to bring me back a lunch.  I can pay him cash.  I can e-transfer the money to him.  I can offer him lunch next time.  
And if he used bitcoin? I could send it to him.  When bitcoin is ubiquitous.  when it's in everyone's wallet.  that's when we can do p2p.  but right now? its companies that can write a business proposal that are going to push bitcoin.  They have to do things to the letter.  they have to appease the US government.  They have to have strict rules for shareholders.  
Give them a piece of the pie.  the benefit of the doubt.  its a great place to start.
