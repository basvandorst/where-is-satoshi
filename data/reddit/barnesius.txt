That's good advice. If you ask me, BTC trading is virtually FOREX - there are enormous differences but on the scale of knowledge i have of both of them they might as well be the same thing.
I'm not a gambling man, but the main thing to remember is that actually bitcoins as a currency have huge potential as a logistical way of paying for things! 
Do you hold many?

Hahaha! I'm not laughing at their misfortune, but that would DEFINITELY happen if I had a generator of my own...

 Bitbargain are my homies.

The main way i'd do it is apply for a vendor account on a UK based BTC exchange. Would you recommend this? :)

I was buying about 0.5BTC summer 2013, and cut my teeth with the logistics of it all. I spent what i had, and it would probably have been a very different year had i not!
I've heard the term 'fiat' used a lot. What does it mean?

This is the kind of thing i need to hear! I can buy about 0.25BTC without worrying too much about consequences - I'm just not convinced buying small is worth it. If i buy a small amount of BTC I'm not likely to get a decent return, but I don't know what I'd buy with it either :P

I just did the maths on mining bitcoins.
 
With petrol prices the way they are, it's cheaper to use a computer to mine bitcoins running off of a petrol generator than paying for home electricity.
 
If you bought a little 2.7 litre generator and ran a £400 computer to generate the bitcoins off it, you'd profit by £1.11 each day, with the exchange rate between BTC and GBP the way it is.
 
If you factor in the cost of the generator and the bitcoins machine, don't account for increase in petrol prices or fluctuations in the exchange rate... You'll have earned your investment back in little under 3 years.
