This is what you say when you want refund in fiat after a 600% bitcoin rise 
But have you see the contract with Bitpay ? 50/50 maybe or 80/20 ? 
How know ? Not me.
But if instead of rise, the price was $2, i'm sure they'd refund in bitcoin.

Nothing is free or the product is you...

@_date: 2014-03-18 19:22:06
For me, a pen + a paper is more user friendly for 99% VS this *NASA like* set up  
1.  The 2FA tokens are backed up on their servers. If you ever lose your phone, wipe your phone, switch to a new phone, you're covered. Install Authy on the new phone, and voila. It sends a verification SMS, and email, to which you must answer to both. On top of that you encrypt your backup with a passphrase of your choosing, so even if someone steals your SIM card and email, you're still protected. While Gmail has alternative 2FA methods like texting you or even using backup codes, many sites don't have that option. Good luck telling a Bitcoin site to turn off 2FA. That would defeat the purpose. Sites like EclipseMC will wait 30 days before even making a move. So it's to your advantage to have a backup. To me the increased functionality of having a backup far outweighs the slight security risk you're taking. Don't like backups? Fine. Turn it off.
2.  Authy's actually PIN protected. Google Authenticator is not. Anyone can pick up your phone and then bam. Goodbye 2FA codes.
3.  Multi device if you want. Want to have your 2FA codes on your phone AND your tablet? No worries.
4.  Beautiful interface. Holo for Android!
5.  It's zero knowledge encryption. Authy has no knowledge of your password that you encrypt your tokens with. If you lose your password, you're screwed. But that's good for security!
Keep it simple

In light of mtgox's filing for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Friday, we have decided it no longer makes sense to offer trading of "GOXBTC".
Effective immediately, no new users may register nor anyone deposit "real" BTC with the site, and at 6pm today (PST) trading will halt. At that time all remaining open orders in the book will also be canceled.
Withdrawals of "real" BTC will of course continue, and they will still be processed once a day at around 11pm (withdrawal requests must be placed by 8pm).
We will continue to work towards a final resolution of the mtgox bankruptcy situation, and work to get our users' pro-rata share of any remaining mtgox assets. We will provide updates on this progress on this site as new information presents itself.

Dunno what you're talking about. 


Because it's not how Bit2bit work. they keep control/property of the ATM


This ATM, first, was there to facilitate bitcoin acceptation in the *cafe*
 * The cafe is now accepting bitcoin (in a fashion), accepting receipts from the machine as payment for food and coffees, you put the fiat money into the ATM and get out a receipt to pay by BTC. This is how they accept bitcoin [source](
Now, if one day, i wanna run a meth trafic and laundred the money, yes bitcoin will be a good solution! 
But i'll be smart enought to not use this specif ATM... and go on local bitcoin or OTC 
Co-owner of the *cafe* is a former gang member, AT LEAST they (the gang) heard about Bitcoin, at worst they run a drug operation with bitcoin. 
No big deal for me, they use cellphone, internet. Bitcoin is just a tool 
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:38:56

THIS IS BITCOIN because of *plausible deniability*

The bank refund you only because they know the system is a total crap but it would be far more expensive to make a new one. 
They have insurance for it, paid for by the fees that you pay each year and each transaction.
btw, now on 2014 it's possible to run Linux &amp; windows on the same computer..
So you still be able to use all yours software 
Even just for the time you do some bitcoin related operation. You just need a USB stick with linux 
Also like you didn't go buy a pack of milk with $50K , you didnt keep all yours bitcoin in the same security level

Not if an army of analyst working for your corporate bring you a big report on how bitcoin will take over on their jucy market.
If i'll lose $2b/year, it's better to put money now. And i can talk with other services who may also lose some share vs bitcoin. they'll put money together
btw $10b is just anexemple, i thinks he was thinking more like *you have 
unlimited credit*
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:27:17
You didn't need $10b 
All exploits to hack every computer/network/name it, are out there.
This is the easy part for any 3 letter agency, just pick a (big) target.  
The most difficult, is to put the blame on someone else. 
It's help if he/they are well know on Bitcoin community.
It's help if you can induce discredit in Bitcoin protocol (aka bitcoin malleability BS,etc...)

BRIDGES was the computer forensics expert on the Baltimore investigation. In their capacity as members of the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force, both FORCE and BRIDGES had significant exposure to and developed expertise in the digital currency known as Bitcoin.

ONE BILLION DOLLARDS earnings instead 1 million bitcoins (a shadowy currency nobody knows)

I'll  sale half 
Then buy a house in a calm  aera 2000km away from any nuclear facility (not in europe nor USA)
Some seeds, silvers, solar panels &amp; guns.
Start my little farm and try to be more self-sufficient 
Once it's done, i'll enjoy, with a beer, the freefall of occident, drowning in his own shit
Hope for the best but prepare for the worst

Thanks to satoshi,  the entire bitcoin design purpose it's to be resilliant to *any* attack.
So when you see what's going on on more important subjects on worldwide.
Imo just no way, they can find a consensus on a small threat like bitcoin

Kidding, but it's not far from the reality :)

If you thinks that way you will gonna sell your house to fed them ? :)
But you know that , in the long run is not a viable solution.
Because you can do more for them if you have a house to organise. 
Same logic apply here.
Give a fish to a man, he'll eat one day, teach him how to fish, he'll eat all his life 
disclamer : i eat 3 time/day, no idea what is the feeling of being starved so maybe i guess emotionally you're right ! 
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:17:39
Let me explain like this :
You sold physical gold on a website and your fees are also in gold
In 2011, gold is 10$/once and you sell for 1M$
In 2012 gold is 100$/once and you sell for 1M$
In 2013, gold is 1000$/once, LE stop you and  IRS claim you made 1B$ business 
Would you say they are right ?
But i agree with the 80M$ !

Do you plan to sold the datas ? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:08:18
Still no answers to my 2 questions :)
Where is the second copy ?
Where are the missing parts ?
Or at least the public address, should be not too difficult to find it, where the coin are come from ?
Btw i got my house flooded 2 times and not a paper or anything in there, were white or close to white after the flood.
You must have a very clean basement and flooded with spring water, lucky you

2500btc bought @ 14pm
2500btc sold 10h later 
My guess is : a attempt to manipulate the market  but finally just a fail !
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:18:16
Imo if i worked for them, I'd ask the ID copy.
Nothing stops you to write it yourself
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:29:33
That's why it was a smart move to say $80-$180 instead of $4 
My guess will be 3btc @ $88 and 40 @ 180$ 
I join everyone : congrats !
Question, what was the reaction of your parents ?
