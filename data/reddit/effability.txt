By public it means mom pop retail investors who hear about Bitcoin from their grandson and then again on a scammy radio add.

I just think you should just go and find out what agorism is and then you'll get it.
If anything, linking to ancap,libertarian, crypto, etc subs is just a better way for newcomers to bitcoin to understand some of the philosophies that fuel its use. 
I don't think one can understand the political and social significance of bitcoin without understanding the basics of counter economics.

Right on. My philosophy has always been bitcoin is either worth thousands or nothing. I'm happy to loose my small investment if it turns out to be nothing for a chance to hit it big. 
I'm optimistic for all the same reasons everyone else who understands bitcoin is. Look what happened when China figured it out. Most of the world, including the mainstream financial sector has yet to hear of or understand bitcoin to an extent where they'll use it. 
I see a day in the very near future where money managers will suggest a portion of any portfolio be comprised of BTC or another crypto currency, just as they would suggest gold today (or a year ago). That's when the rush begins, this is all just the calm before the storm.

if the bitcoin community was flooded with or users, I don't see what the issue would be with their subs being linked. 
Now lets be serious. The reason the subs are linked is because of the heavy cross traffic. You may not like the reality but bitcoin is loved by anarcho-capitalits because it is one of the most effective forms of agorism in existence. In many ways it encapsulates many of the principles of counter economics and libertarianism in practice, not just theory.
I don't think its a stretch to say if you like some of the aspects of bitcoin, you may agree with some of the principles of anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism. Not everything, but if you're into decentralization of power...
