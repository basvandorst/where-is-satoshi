bitcoin as paypal is a sideshow for idiots. Look at the one trick pony that is bitpay. They have been losing money since 2012. They had to sell their soul to bitmain to stay afloat. Now they have to shill bcrash for a living.
bitpay is failing because rational people do not buy bitcoin to then spend it on things they could have used fiat for in the first place. If your tx does not run the risk of being censored or reversed then it is pointless to use the bitcoin blockchain for it.

Thanks for clearing up the network fee thing. I did not know that.
Still, retail payments seem pointless most of the time. Do you really need bitcoin if your tx does not run the risk of being censored or reversed? There is a whole range of other use cases that make bitcoin great. I can't figure how Bitcoin as paypal is one of them. 
It was a great proof of concept use case but it had it's run. It turns out that people don't buy bitcoin to then spend them on things they could have used their fiat for in the first place.

A bitcoin accepting merchant will still have to respect the local regulation regarding fraud and charge backs.
In Europe, for instance, you get to cancel any online order of physical goods within 8 days and the money needs to be paid back. Bitcoin does not solve this for the merchant. Bitcoin's volatility makes this a lot harder.
As far as payments go: Bitcoin shines when you need your tx to be censorship and reversal resistant. About 80% of the planet lives under some form of capital controls so censorship resistant transactions are a pretty huge use case. Buying products with bitcoin which do not run the risk of being censored or reversed seems pretty useless in general.

Real estate prices are driven by interest rates. The rates can hardly go lower so it is going to be hard for property prices to go higher.
With yields where they are it only makes sense to buy real estate if you get a high LTV. 
Buying with cash money in places with high interest rates is another option because high interest rates mean high rental yields (ukraine, moldova, etc). Unfortunately these areas also have more risks.
I would stick to bitcoin for a couple more years. property prices are peaking everywhere.

Roger thinks bitcoin should sacrifice it's unique selling points so it can compete with paypal.
If we follow the bcash route then only corporate entities can run nodes and we would all have to trust those entities to not censor our transactions. We would have just replaced legacy banks with crypto banks.
let me help you out with 2 examples. It clearly shows how bcash is controlled by miners and bitcoin isn't.
tldr: segwit2x failed because nodes refused to run the software. Even an 85% miner majority couldn't pull of the hard fork because nodes refused. This shows how nodes are an important player in the constant tug of war that is bitcoin. They make sure that nobody can control bitcoin.
TLDR: this is what happens when bch nodes are centralized in the hands of miners and the happy few. a centralised shitcoin where miners can just steal your funds whenever they feel like it.
personally i think it is unwise to sacrifice bitcoin's censorship resistance and immutability to enable a use case (retail payments) which has already proven to have very low real demand. bitpay, for instance, was struggling long before the fees went up.
Lots of people used the high fees to explain how they weren't to blame for their failing businesses. Roger has a lot of failed ventures under his belt.

Let me know if the mystical blockchain that can replace bitcoin with it's magical powers finally comes along.
a double spend means that somebody actually has to give you goods or services to the tune of $100M in bitcoin and then be fine with only a few confirmations. Only idiots would agree to this but they usually don't have $100M to spend.

I did because all these alt projects have the same critical ~~mistake~~ lie:
Crypto is all about: Don't trust, verify! If you can't verify then it's pointless because we would just be replacing legacy banks with 'crypto banks'. The article you send literally says that it is not important for individuals to verify and so they sacrificed it to enable sharding. 
They do this because they need to sell their shit coin to retail investors(noobs). Those noobs fall for on chain features like high throughput or smart contracts. That's because Noobs don't realize how these features will lead to centralization down the line. It's a mathematical certainty (provided a chain get some actual use).
In the end, it's only your problem if you get rekkt on some alt. it's your money so you should do your own research. There is no such thing as too much research

avoid it at all cost.
I bought a laptop with bitcoin in 2013. That thing is just gathering dust now but it cost me ca. $120k.
Nobody should experience this kind of pain. So everybody pushing people to spend their bitcoins on things that don't run the risk of being censored or reversed is a scammer.

more than a terrible idea.
POS is a rent seeking attempt. A poor yield to the rich scheme for the digital age. It rewards doing nothing but voting according to the party line. 
Furthermore bitcoin mining is efficiently gobbling up energy nobody else can use. No extra energy is produced for bitcoin mining. It also uses over 75% renewables.
The environment is the favourite argument of the simpleton altcoin bag holders.

show me one of those other project that is now used as money to buy coffee etc instead of bitcoin.
There are none. This is because most people are rational and don't see the point in buying bitcoin to then turn around and spend it on things you could have used your fiat for in the first place.
If your tx does not run the risk of being censored or reversed then there isn't a rational reason to use bitcoin for retail payments.
P2P cash means money free of government interference. It's sad how some 'thought leaders' have watered p2p cash down to...it must compete with paypal or bitcoin will have failed.
@_date: 2019-10-02 15:00:43
If Bitcoin was just meant to be some paypal competitor then you would be correct.
Luckily it is not. bitcoin is censorship resistant money beyond the control of governments. This is not really useful to europeans or north-americans but people in countries like china, russia, india, venezuela, argentina, etc etc have a real need for money that can't be stopped or manipulated by their government.
another big use case is data immutability. Companies like [ [ many more use the bitcoin blockchain to make data fraud and corruption resistant.  [ Maybe people start accepting bitcoin as a serious SOV when they figure out that bitcoin is used to secure the property stock of entire nations.

All fiat currencies are designed to lose value through inflation. Bitcoin is designed to increase in value through deflation. So far long term hodlers have been rewarded.
If you live in a highly developed nation then there isn't much use for bitcoin as a currency over fiat. Only transactions that run the risk of being censored or reversed (like Wikileaks donations) make sense in places like the E.U. 
The E.U is the exception, over 80% of the global population faces capital restrictions enforced by their local governments. Bitcoin liberates those people from these restrictions and protects them from their hyper inflationary local currency (Argentina, Venezuela, etc etc).
Bitcoin is also very effective as a trust machine. [ and [ are good examples of this application. Exonum secures the republic of Georgia's land registry via Bitcoin so this tech is already being used in production. Bitcoin as the trust machine increases bitcoin's appeal as digital gold because it's a use case where bitcoin has no real competition.

Hmm in this case middlemen are actually useful.

@_date: 2019-10-14 09:26:40
see how all these 'solutions' involve shifting the goal posts? Just like all the other pseudo science articles, this one also claims that running a fully validating node on consumer grade hard ware is not necessary. In reality it is the most important part and any coin sacrificing this is a worthless scam coin. Again: SFYL 
Decentralization in the Trilemma
Perhaps a more interesting question is whether the spirit of the question is useful. In particular, many people have grabbed on to its non-mathematical definition of decentralization, which can be paraphrased as: “Participants must be able to run a full validator node on a regular laptop.” In Big O space, running a validator on a Raspberry Pi and a high-performance server (or even a supercomputer) are equivalent,⁴ so the informal definition does not truly reflect decentralization as defined mathematically in the Trilemma.
Nevertheless, the informal definition is cited in the mathematical definition as well as several times subsequently, and the clear qualitative intention is that the critical part of decentralization is that you can run a full node on average consumer hardware.
Does this condition meaningfully capture the concept of decentralization? No, at least not in a way that has any significant impact in any reasonable real-world setting. Put another way, while there may be some theoretical significance of being able to run a full node on your laptop, there is no plausible practical significance.

I would recommend a donation to [ Hong Kong is a prime example of why bitcoin is needed. You can also donate to them with lightning [

Problem with regular merchant adoption is that almost all merchants are forced to have your crypto immediately converted to fiat or they will end up with an accounting nightmare. That's why Aliant basically market sells bitcoin on your behalf and gives the fiat to the merchant (at a pretty bad rate for you compared to selling bitcoin on an exchange).
It could also be worth pointing out that Bitcoin is used for much more then just money. [ Use cases like this make bitcoin attractive as a store of value. [

It might be worth nothing to you but to me bitcoin would be worthless if it were just a paypal style payment system. 
I use bitcoin for proof of immutability. Check [ and [ for some elegant bitcoin scaling solutions. They have paying customers and pretty big ones too. Exonum, for instance, secures the land registry of the republic of Georgia. 
Don't you think making data fraud and corruption resistant will make bitcoin more appealing as a store of value compared to ... bitcoin must compete with paypal or it failed?
Also spending bitcoin does not make it's value increase. It creates sell pressure. Hodling makes the value increase.

Will your dapp have it's own token like almost every dapp?
If so then you only need ether for gas and staking fees. I bet you want those things to cost as little as possible or you would move to another smart contract platform. A low ether price seems like a good thing for your dapp and ethereum. Ether is just a utility token and it needs to be cheap. Sell your ETH to help ethereum;)

The first article promotes a product which is deployed at oil wells. It captures natural gas and converts it to electricity then bitcoin. The alternative is burning the gas of into the atmosphere. Those are your choices in the here and now.
In the bitcoin mining industry natural gas is only competitive when it is subsidized like in Iran and Kazachstan. Obviously I am against subsidized fossile fuels but this is hardly something bitcoin miners can be blamed for.
I do think Bitcoin's energy consumption is a positive and not only because it is directly related to security. As I mentioned before, this planet has grossly miss-allocated it's renewable energy resources. A place like greenland could generate enormous amounts but it has no demand. Bitcoin could be to places like Greenland what oil has been to Dubai. Maybe it will keep the Greenlanders from exploring analog mining operations with Trump;).

miners mostly use hydro power and ca. 40% of global hydro production goes to waste because it is almost impossible to curtail hydro production. Water just keeps flowing and those hydro plants are usually in remote areas and they were purpose build. When the purpose (paper factory, aluminium smelter, etc, etc) goes bust the hydro power is still being produced without a storage, transport or local consumption option. 
Bitcoin miners are buyers of last resort. This is a huge unique selling point bitcoin miners have because this planet has grossly misallocated renewable energy resources and it is virtually impossible to create a global grid connecting everything together.
