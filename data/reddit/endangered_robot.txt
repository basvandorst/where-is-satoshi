I think you can. If you know someone who's very active on the network like a trader or miner, you could(in theory) trade with them without ever accessing the web i.e. buying and trading locally. I've even offered this to people I know personally that are very new to bitcoin.

I'm my own bank now... 
so basically FUCK storing your money for some huge company just so they can play with it however they please. It's 2014 I would suggest more to go bankless. We all remembered what happened in the UK...

Every other crypto has done better than btc this year. [lol]( 
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:40:57


bots trading taking over the network while whales cashin on the mayhem. GG failure
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:37:54
exactly! and in order to keep the people who are actually interested in mining these coins financially viable to do so the price of the coin needs to go up because of the ever increasing difficulty. i.e. it's never getting any easier to mine for just a single coin. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:58:17
Yea this is awesome! It's cool to see that I'm in the majority in nearly every category applicable. Very cool stuff keep up the good work
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:45:23
LOL Your a grown ass man crying for attention. It's sad really
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:18:39
Exactly the world is a ugly ugly place. Please OP the denizens of the internet recommend you never go full retard again.
@_date: 2014-10-26 06:51:45
FUCK THE IRS
Get your money
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:01:34
That would be pretty freakin awesome.
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:10:14
So Mark Karpeles got away with stealing all those coins....?
@_date: 2014-10-24 02:23:02
But we're no where close to the moon with BTC so the pic on it is very laughable 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:39:15
Thank you for posting this! I'd love to see more :D Things like this really help me keep track of what alls going down in the btc world! :)

[mfw you're being serious](
If you think this is an acceptable risk then you're well past full retard
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:53:57
I'm sorry our currency doesn't steal from everyone but the rich to buy guns to sell to brown people so we can then go blow them up because we don't have anything better to do today.

Dude... If you're old enough to be my dad you should know better than this. 
 


[lol]( 
I mean, you seriously don't think risking your life for what amounts to a hike through the woods was a shit idea...? O_o|o_O


Afraid?! Bitch please x'D
You got robbed by **3 world children** and are trying to hand down life lessons...? 
[Oh the irony](   
@_date: 2014-07-29 05:50:29


Totally LOL banks offering BTC services xDDDD BTC side steps banks so why on earth would banks offer any help at all for BTC users? Please use your head. BTC is the enemy of the federally regulated money-for-hire corporatocracy 
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:33:14
Anyone with a brain can tell you this isn't about bitcoin...
What most people fail to understand is that Newsweek like any other **MAGAZINE** company is failing at a desperate attempt to adapt to an E-zine. 
So whether it's fact of fiction, grounded in reality or completely insane they'll post **WHATEVER** they want that's deemed "buzzworthy"
Harass someone who we say is Satosh? No prob! Completely make a fool out of rando internet idiots? EASY! Take Bitcoiners down a peg in the aftermath? YOU GOT IT!
It's so sad to watch media manipulation in action....
@_date: 2014-10-29 01:00:41

I've given good advice on this thread over and over again. 
its the internet... stop taking things so fucking personal.

bitmain screwed me on my last purchase. Miners barely worked and they've refused to help me. So fuck them
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:20:42
that sums up both of the miners I have here. 
100% garbage
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:33:02
mischief, mayhem, soap :)
@_date: 2013-05-06 09:54:49
Very cool! Thanks for this!
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:11:06
I *accidentally* got excited cause it went up to &gt;200$. 
What a fool I was...

[exactly how I feel](
@_date: 2013-08-20 01:02:55
well the problem is if you become the gov then you'll also have to rape and pillage anything and everything else that you don't like or thats not directly sucking your dick. 
Their by pissing off literally anyone who has a working brain.  
@_date: 2013-08-20 01:13:18
EXACTLY! I'll be lucky if I get my miner THIS YEAR. but the best part? IT WON'T EVEN BE WORTH WHAT A PAID FOR IT WHEN IT GETS HERE.
FUCK BUTTERFLY. It'll be fun to watch their ship sink as anyone who ever cared about bitcoins turns their back to their horseshit business model. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:35:42
"TEH PRICE DID WHAT?!?!?"

any word on the mini rig? 
@_date: 2013-09-20 18:53:45
Bitcoin exist BECAUSE the FED is total bullshit and the corporatocracy controls the money supply... 
No one is even acknowledging the opposite like the FED's argument suggests... It's a bold faced lie to protect the real lie: the dollar. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:19:21
magical internet Kung-fu?! Sounds sexy
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:58:57
Inherent inflation coupled with greedy all for none taxation and **insane** spending means they're(gov and big companies alike) doing their best to kill the dollar. Bitcoin isn't part of that equation.  
@_date: 2013-08-20 01:20:06
Hold on, hold on you ready to laugh???? DIRECTLY from the butterfly site...
"If you're uncomfortable waiting until the development is complete and the product is shipped, **do NOT**(ever) **pre-order** this product"
Suggesting to customers to not order is funny enough but suggesting for them to wait until after that piece of shit debuts... PRICELESS
the butterfly business model: Wait until the product is COMPLETELY worthless THEN ship it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:29:08
TO THE MOON!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-28 10:44:55
Absolutely. I've seen lots of businesses come into being because of the coin... Mine included ^_^
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:19:51
I figured the singles would run hot but cooling them off doesn't seem like a problem too me if they do. "data center cooling" for one unit could be as simple as adding an extra fan. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:15:04
DO IT! I've seen post after post after post suggesting people to just BUY SOME COINSSSS! 
As a financial expert, this is a solid strategy. 
Some additional advice if you decide to buy would be looking into day trading with your coins. If you're able to trade just once a day, the right way, you might not want to ever stop ;P
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:45:46
That's the same garbage OS they built windows 8 on. Their basically the same thing. It might work okay for a mobile platform... but that doesn't mean the software underneath isn't complete shit. For further proof ask what they think of windows 8

This is exactly how I explained it to my mum when she asked this very question. 
It's just like dollars, euros, yen, ect. in their digital form :D 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:27:15
I've been mining for quite awhile and I can help ^ _ ^
hmmmm just 41 Mhash's huh. Well that doesn't seem like enough to continue so I wouldn't worry about mining. I would recommend you check out how mining works in full(if anything) just for a better understanding of bitcoin and how it [all works]( 
But at the moment and for the future you will need significantly powerful hardware to attempt to mine and make a return on your investment. This is getting tougher and tougher by the day because more hardware is joining the network.  
If you're truely interested in bitcoins generally would recommend you buy coins and go from there.   
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:12:13
If you're right, I'll be running butt naked up and down my street yelling "WOOOOOOO!"

i've use VLC player for so long I'm now running windows N(the one without the media player)
making this a thing would be so damn awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:24:53
This is why I, for a time, began sleeping in 3 hours blocks...
@_date: 2013-12-31 11:53:12


Exactly! Transactions growing even faster while more hardware joins the network to help support the every increasing load of exchanges. It's... beautiful :')
