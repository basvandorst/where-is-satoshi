I see. Well, at least it makes sense and the coin is safe in the meantime. Would you be ok with me contacting you in the future when segwit gets activated? I am sure I could use your help and I still want to reward you. 
Many many many thanks so far.

Thank you very much!
I actually managed to get the address by using the BIP39 tool and I put the corresponding private key in a BTC wallet (Electrum). However I don't see any coins. It might be because Segwit is not active yet/supported by Electrum, but another expert who was helping me out mentioned something about me needing a redeem script to be able to see and recover the coin. Do you think that is necessary?
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:19:57
If I get my coin back because of your instructions, I will buy you a brand new one. No bamboozle. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:39:13
And for the script the private key is needed, right?
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:48:05
I transferred a coin to an LTC address and apparently I can only access it when segwit gets activated. I am forced to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:38:10
I bought two. I wonder why I didn't buy three. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:23:29
In my case it didn't make any difference where the litecoin was. I think you can follow the process exactly as described. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:57:30
Haha thanks. I also feel much more relaxed now. ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:04:51
The p2sh address started with 3. Thanks for all the info, I will look into it carefully. Do I have to wait for the segwit activation, though?
I am also aware of the security concerns. My plan is to move all my coins out of my Trezor anyway, since their customer support refused to help me and I don't ever want to do any business with Satoshilabs again.

@_date: 2017-08-25 21:32:22
He is right, though. We need to be critical if we want to improve. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:41:17
The mistake was made partially because of their weird interface. You move the mouse over an address, it becomes a link cursor, but clicking it does not copy the address. 
Besides, I can get my coin back with a couple of steps that somebody who works at Trezor should know by heart. Since it is their wallet, the person who helped me out online got a Trezor of their own to be able to reproduce the situation.
Say whatever you will, but not sparing 20 minutes of a developer to help somebody who misplaced $2000+ is pretty shitty customer service in my book. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:21:28
I don't get it.

I will try to find some info on the topic so we can communicate better. I am looking forward to hearing from you on your progress. 
You are by far the most helpful person I have talked to on this topic. I am very grateful and impressed by your skills. I hope you will allow me to properly reward the time and effort you are investing in this.

Hey, that's me!
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:34:19
You seem to know about this stuff. I recently mistakenly transferred a Bitcoin to my Litecoin address from Trezor and I have not been able to recover it. People say I can recover it because I own the seed that generated the address. However, those who tried to help claimed I needed to wait for segwit to be activated in the Bitcoin network, as Litecoin already supports it. 
Is this true? Do you think I could still recover my coin? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:57:03

Hey man, how are you?
So, I have been reading about redeem scripts and I was wondering how do you find the right one to use? Since the transaction happened from Coinbase to my Trezor address, do I have to ask Coinbase for it? Or are there standard scripts you can try out without having to ask anyone?
Have a nice Sunday!

Yes both addresses were from my Trezor wallets. I had the private key. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:27:57
Hello bud. All the steps you mentioned work, I got the address back and everything. But where is the balance? I don't understand how by only adding addresses to the program I will be able to see the coin or do anything to it... The address is already there, I am trying to rescan now, takes forever, though :(
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:24:29

@_date: 2017-08-24 17:14:41
Hello buddy, how are you?
So, Segwit should be active now, right? I tried again to create a wallet with the private key I got from your process and unfortunately it is still empty :(
Is there any step after receiving the M address from the network? I expected to see the Bitcoin there already and be able to send it somewhere else.
Do you have any more ideas? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:15:18
Block explorers? P2SH template? I have no idea what you are talking about.
Man, it doesn't matter how much I learn there are always tons of new stuff to figure out. This is so frustrating. It should not be so hard to recover from such a small mistake. Bitcoin is dangerous.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:32:27
Hello again! I tried to use your program but it did not work...
When I put my seed on this page:  I only get a list of private keys that start with "T" (never with L like yours). And if I input any of these keys on the program it says "version mismatch". :(
Do you know how I can get the key in the format you used? Or do you know which format generates "T" addresses? Maybe we could adapt your program if we know.
Many thanks once more!
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:09:14
Hey there!
So, I used your new program and I actually managed to find the private key corresponding to the address I used in LTC.
I used the second program to convert the LTC private key to BTC private key and Electrum accepted the key! However, the wallet is empty :(
I got information from other people that, since Electrum does not support segwit, I need to wait for segwit to be activated in order to access my coins. Do you think this might be the problem?
By the way, you are awesome! I don't know how to thank you for all this. When I get my coin back I will be glad to send you a reward. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:45:06
I can't believe it, but the Rescan worked! I have my coin back!
Please provide me an address so I can send you a reward. You were more than awesome.
I will post your guide to the LTC/BTC Reddits so other people can also maybe save their coins. This was a wild ride!
Thank you soooo much. Have a great weekend!

That is amazing! Even my mom could follow this guide :-)
I will try it as soon as I get home today and then give you an update. After this whole ordeal is over, I want to post an update from the post where I told people to be careful when they transfer their coins using Trezor. Do you mind if I link this guide in there? Of course I will mention you and give you all the credit for it. Cheers!

He states he started buying when the price was $580, so he had a lot of initial capital to invest.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:03:39
No, the transaction is valid. I can see the coin standing there on the same address where I transferred my coins to the litecoin network.
I made the transfer from Coinbase so I had to use a p2sh converter. Then the address was valid.

If this works I would like to give you a small reward. I will message you later telling the good news and asking for your BTC address. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:23:41
Just remember you have no money until that money is really in your hands/bank account. Don't start spending assuming the price can't drop.

Any time is a good time to jump in. Get a small fraction to get used to the processes and tools and learn about how the whole thing works. It is fascinating and definitely going to become more mainstream in the future. You will still be able to tell your kids you were an early adopter. ;)

Okay, that's small potatoes. I wonder if BCH will ever support Segwit, though ;)
Next week I should be finally able to recover my coin. I am so excited. Have a nice Sunday, mate. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:30:19
Hello! So, I tried it out and it seems to work nicely. I was able to find the address and the keys. It seems that only Segwit is missing now.
I am counting the days :) Will be sure to let you know if I get the coin back and when I post my update on r/bitcoin and r/litecoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:47:14
Interesting you say that. They did not provide me any help when I accidentally transferred a Bitcoin to one of my Trezor litecoin addresses. I had to find help with strangers from the internet. I moved all my coins out of my Trezor and don't ever want to do any business with them anymore.

@_date: 2017-11-02 09:13:04
Yes but it’s a backup. So you will have the keys and the device. If you misplace / break one of them, you can still access your coins to move them to another location. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:15:30
In case your key gets lost or destroyed you can still access your coins using the device and your pin. This would enable you to move the coins to a new location where you know the key. 
Similarly, if the device gets lost or breaks, you can use the key to access the coins. So you have two independent ways to access your coins and the chance that both fail at the same time is much lower.

It's because Crypto makes us feel like we have control over our investments and economy in general. The simple fact that it is not bound to any country in particular makes it so much more relatable than fiat and local investment options.

I don't know, man. In 2008 bitcoin also lost a lot of value. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:32:08
You have to pay taxes on any gains over 600€ per year. I don't know the exact value of the taxes.
If you hold your coins for a year or more before selling, your gain is tax free.
What I am going to do is reinvest all my gains in Bitcoin. This way I can try to sell high/buy low but not pay any taxes on my lucky guesses.
On the other hand, if you lose money with speculation, you can also declare it and get a tax deduction from your other speculative gains.

But don't expect the prices to drop much. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:30:27
Probably it will start selling at 9500 or something. People expect others to sell at round numbers and want to jump out first. 
That's probably what happened today. People wanted to sell before it got to 2500 and that's why the dip occurred.

The tax authorities do not know or care about any wallets. In fact they can't check any of your bitcoin holdings and will purely rely on what you report to them. Therefore you are free to do as you choose. If asked, you can easily prove based on the movements that the amount of Bitcoin you purchased on a certain date is also the amount of Bitcoin you are selling a year later. It's a good idea to keep a record of when you made your biggest purchases so you can easily track them later. 
The only risk you take, as far as I know, is if you receive proceedings of a sale on a bank account and the tax authorities ask you where that comes from. If you want to do everything by the book and be a good citizen and pay your taxes properly, you either report your gains if they exceed 600€ a year (as in: one of your bank accounts/your person received this money as a result of selling amounts of Bitcoin you held for less than a year) on your tax declaration or you keep your coins and speculation funds wherever you want (wallets, exchanges) and only transfer the gains to the bank after you held the amount of coins for more than a year, in which case they will be tax free. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:01:06
Well I am using Coinbase. For small amounts I think you will be fine there. If the price starts rising and you don't want to have that much money on them you can move the coins to a wallet.

I bought my Trezor with the amazing gains from last week, so I didn't even care. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:24:19
The link does not really describe the steps in detail. Let's say my Litecoin wallet's address is A. In order to send the Litecoins there from Coinbase, I had to use this [P2SH Converter]( This gave me address B. After sending the Litecoins to B, I also sent a Bitcoin to B by mistake. So B is a valid BTC address, because the coin arrived there, right?
Therefore I don't understand what you mean with "You need to recalculate the LTC address received BTC into a real valid BTC address". From my understanding, I already have this address (B) and I only need the private key to access it.
Since I assume that I can get the private key to B by using the same seed I used on my Trezor (since both LTC and BTC wallets use the same seed), I just need to know how to generate/extract this key. This is the step that I don't know how to do.
Assuming K are the private keys for my Litecoin wallet in Trezor (which I can extract using the Trezor seed in a wallet like Electrum), how can I manipulate K to retrieve Bitcoin keys that will give access to my lost Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:15:14
Glad to help. Please don't take my reply too seriously, as I am also learning about all this stuff. I am proceeding like that, but it could be that I am mistaken as well :-/
Either way, I believe the chance that we get in any sort of trouble acting like this is very, very small.

@_date: 2017-05-25 09:13:46
If you need the money, sure, why not. But if you don't need the money in the next few years, you can keep your coins because even after a crash (or many), the price will eventually rebound.
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:19:21
Thanks for helping out. But if I import my key into an LTC wallet, how does that help me? I need a BTC wallet to be able to recover my coin, right?

Could you please elaborate? How can I access the Bitcoin if my private keys are in the trezor?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:21:55
I used my seed to get a list of addresses/keys for LTC and I tried using one of this keys on Electrum to create a BTC wallet. It does not recognize the key as being valid...
Maybe the LTC key requires some manipulation to be valid for BTC? Do you have any idea of that? Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:15:17
