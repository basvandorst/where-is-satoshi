I think someone was casing my house a few weeks ago when BTC was booming. Makes sense as criminals are very tech savvy these days. I tweeted once about bitcoin in 2013, maybe they are looking on social media for marks. My house is built like a fortress though (Georgian mid terrace) and backs directly on to a secure government building so they would find it extremely difficult to get in, and even more difficult to get out in one piece. 
Anecdotally the Georgians were the first architects to build houses with a primary focus on security; heavy shuttered windows, iron bolts, solid heavy wood doors etc. They are much more secure than most modern houses. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:20:35
They can't get in, that's the whole point. Even a police battering ram wouldn't work. They would have to take a circular saw to take out a section of the solid wood, 3 inch thick door, by that point the alarm would be raised and the neighbours would come out and back it. I've lived in this area for decades (WC1, Central London), I'm well connected, put it that way. No locals would try and rob me, I know the founders of the most prominent local street gang in the area from school. There's always someone at my place anyway. 
If you mean an attack on me personally outside the premesis I suppose it's possible but that would be a bad idea, I'm 6ft, 84KG and a Judoka, Jitsu practitioner and Kickboxer. Sometimes I wish people would so I could let off some steam but no-one has initiated a street/bar conflict with me in over 10 years.

Sounds like malware/virus on your computer. It's unlikely to be a Bitstamp problem. I don't wish to unnecessarily concern you but be prepared that the money might have been stolen, sorry.
Also, check the deposit address, Bitstamp always use a fresh unused one and keep it the same unless you request a new one. If the address you sent BTC has multiple deposits then it's quite possible your PC is compromised. This is not Bitstamp's fault or liability. Read the 'securing your bitcoin' section on bitcoin.org before doing anything else.

The average user is vastly more likely to get pwned on a windows machine than any other, but not for the reasons you give.
Look at kernel infrastructure and how Unix based os handle process execution and privilege elevation compared to MS kernel. Apple have a fairly large market share and vastly less vulns/infections in relation to their amount of users.
In plain English, windows is less secure than Mac or Linux because it's easier to break into and hack, and not for the reasons you give. You're parroting Microsoft marketing that was published on some bullshit tech crunch site or something. So no, I won't give you a break, windows is an insecure piece of shit operating system, you can't always blame the users for crap performance, that's taught in the first computer science lesson, which I assume you've never taken.

Second off,


isn't a particularly polite thing to say to someone, hence my patronising response.
The rest of your reply addresses none of the points I raised about kernel security or blaming user behaviour. For a self described IT professional I would expect better.
You've basicay backtracked and adapted your original point whilst in the process of avoiding my definitive statement that the architecture/kernel of UNIX-like systems is more secure than windows. Also, that an inexperienced user is significantly more likely to be infected with malware on a windows machine, than a Mac or Linux box, this is fact.
There's a reason Microsoft has to release security patches every 43 seconds because the architecture is inherently insecure, they are constantly trying to plug a dam with wine corks. 
As I said, you can harden windows and make it just about good enough for media applications, but that requires technical skills, disabling services, constant monitoring etc etc. It does have its place, but categoricalally not in the data security industries (bitcoin included), as is evident by just about every industry standard server, internet infrastructure, security company etc etc in existence.

Possibly, it looks like the second peak of the double top. But the exchanges decoupled and top pricing was inaccurate hence why it looks like a breakout.

As you're using Ubuntu, you'll find that there is a "startup items" (programs that start auto when you login) disable the SSH server checkbox. You can find the setting by pressing the windows/command key and typing "startup" in the search that pops up.

There are multiple significant valuable use cases. Here's a few major ones:
Remittances: Bob is in Denmark and wants to send $500usd to Alice in Ukraine. Options are: International bank transfer (high fees, slow). Western Union etc. (high fees, slow) Or bitcoin (low fees, instant transfer - although there are temporarily high fees at the moment, still lower than IBAN).
Secure physical money storage/transfer: Bob could be walking around with 100k USD on an encrypted flash drive. Even if it gets stolen no-one can take the money and Bob can restore it later from another backup. Also if Bob wants to store some wealth in cash it's a lot safer to store an encrypted flash drive in your house than $2000 or a stash of gold/sliver under the mattress.
Deflationary scarce asset: Usually this means that Bob's storage of funds is likely to increase in usd value over time rather than depreciate like fiat.

You're failing to take onboard my point and there's a limit to which I'm willing to re-iterate it. If your car was built by unskilled people and designed by unskilled people it would not work the way you describe, and be useless. If I built you a car tomorrow I guarantee you wouldn't want to drive it. There's a whole chain of skilled people behind your car (designers, fabricators, manufacturers, engineers etc.) that get it to the point you describe where it has utility.
You do however raise the point of utility. BTC also has utility, hence its popularity. If I want to send a payment to someone I can use crypto if it suits the use case, I trust in the ledger because it's cryptographically proved. The energy of skilled people has gone into it, therfore I can trust the ledger, the same way you trust your car to provide utility, the reason it provides utility is due to the energy provided by those who made it.

Yeah, the command in Ubuntu terminal is:

Your IP address is still public when running a node, same as seeding a torrent, visiting a website etc etc. Provided you take basic precautions you should be good. Change the default admin password on your router/modem to a complicated one is a good first step. The only thing most attackers can do with your IP is ddos your node which would make your internet unusable but not risk your internal security/funds. If that happens (it's rare and never happened to me several years running nodes on my home IP) you can usually just reset your router to get a new external IP address, most ISPs use dynamic (changing) IP addresses which will change to a new IP address when you reset your router and therefore the ddos on the old IP address is useless. 
The only other way non state bad actors can attack you via your IP address is through a coordinated social engineering attack where they get you to click a specifically crafted suspect link in an email, while knowing your IP. It's an individually targeted attack so very low odds you will face such an attack but be vigilant with suspicious links as a general rule anyway.

Tell your friends, remember this, let's get this question answered once and for all.
It has value for the same reason the majority of things have value. Because of the effort, energy and skill of highly educated intelligent people, that IS a definition of value. The world's best programmers, cryptographers etc. putting their energy into a useful project, they add continuous value. These people are in high demand, their skills and time are the most sought after in the world and economy today. That is it, it is the time of extremely skilled, abnormally intelligent people that adds value, or you could say is the value of BTC. This is before we get into the technicals of mining and the economics hard coded into the protocol. I hope you can see the incompatibility of your analogy of tearing up bits of paper now.

I think the reason for doing so is that it eliminates a lot of institutional/governmental anxiety about Satoshis coins being moved on the market and causing a financial issue if crypto-currency becomes as big as it potentially could.
However I am neutral on the idea of the redistribution. It's a new chain so whoever owns those BTC will still have those BTC, just not S2X. I am opposed to any form of transaction reversal or anything like that though in principal.

I'm starting to think this might be a consequence of miner centralisation. A very large miner or group of miners sending transactions to themselves, clogging the mempool, then cashing in on fees seems like it would be a net profit for them. I welcome opposing theories or facts that disprove this.

Just spotted a problem with this. The use of language next to the bitcoin payment option:


This does not fit their house style of language. It's unlikely marketing would let this through as it implies that the other payment methods may not be as "secure" and confuse customers.

I think you underestimate the threat from thieves and hackers that these exchanges face. That is far more likely a reason you have had this experience. Imagine if you were an experienced social engineer or hacker and had a direct phone line to manipulate a member of staff, or a confirmed address to try and physically enter through social engineering. They are highly aware of this and following industry standard operational security. If they were "shady" they would incorporate their company in a country with a weak judicial system and high on the global corruption index. Britain is the polar opposite of either of these.

Tell them to go to bitcoinwisdom.com and look at the charts properly. Zoom out. We always see massive rises followed by massive drops in price from the very start of pricing.

I've caught up with that now. Yeah the git revelation is self evident, they haven't provided any explanation except "distributing the coins to our partners" which basically means paying off exchanges to list their coin. Looks like they have pumped the futures price with low volume, will be the only ones with a working wallet first and will dump hard on the exchanges as the first spot orders will likely follow the futures.
 I'm not bothering with it unless I happen to be in BTC on an exchange during trading when it forks then I'll just dump it for BTC if my exchange even credits it.

Yw. Bitcoin is not as fully user friendly as most polished consumer apps yet, but it's expected these issues will be ironed out over time. Allow the process to reindex, it shouldn't take longer than 24-48 hours. If it does, come back and ask as you may need to add a reindex command, hopefully it will just sort itself out.

It's likely the computer shut down or restarted without allowing time for the wallet to close/shut down fully. That's why the devs added "do not shut down computer until this message disappears" window when you close Qt wallet. 
 Yes you will have to do a rescan/reindex but it normally doesn't take as long as the blockchain to download the first time. It's just reindexing the blocks you already downloaded so doesn't take bandwidth. 
Edit: Make sure to shut down the wallet carefully next time and it shouldn't happen again unless importing the blockchain to another machine.

Fair point. I read the tweet, which imo is a borderline alarmist cherry-picked statement, after I skimmed the research paper. From a common sense perspective, I find it hard to believe that the majority of nodes could not tolerate or adapt to a 1X total increase in resource allocation. With regard to the utopian ideal of everyone who uses Bitcoin running a full node I think it's safe to say that ship has sailed. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:44:11
You might have to wait a few days to a week for the transaction to be rejected if it gets no confirmations. It will then be returned to your phone wallet completely, so no chance of loss. It might still confirm if the fee situation gets better over the next few days.

If you've got the balls to buy when the market is saturated in fear and everyone is dismissing the investment then yes, it is.

There will be times next year when either of these dynamics are at play, where you decide to enter and exit will dictate whether it is a good investment or not.

If you still have the computer you can try to recover the data from the hard drive. If you work it out and remember how much your BTC is worth it might be worth effort to recover. Blockchain tells you to write the seed down on paper or print it, so if you find a random set of 12 words in a notebook that could be the recovery seed.

I wouldn't keep 1M in a bank account, ever, unless it was necessary for a business account. Money in a bank account is fractional reserve, as soon as you deposit it they already lent most of it to someone else. I'd diversify with stocks and other assets and keep my current account with the amount of money I need for expenses and that's it. Plus the "you do not have any experience with that kind of money" is not fact based, and makes me think you're somewhat arrogant and self-aggrandizing. The "personal experience" bit makes me think you like people to think you're rich/important and like to "prove" that fact, another pretty ugly characteristic.

It's unreal the police won't help, you've had something valuable stolen, it's theft.

I think there is a middle ground between the big/small block debate. Bcash has gone too far and Bitcoin is a bit too conservative in my opinion. 
2MB doesn't sound unreasonable to me at this time and it's achievable. Hopefully it would build bridges between the bitter divide in the community. Sure, the blockchain will be bigger, but I don't think that will exclude people from running full nodes in the real world. I predict that 90%&gt; of nodes now can easily tolerate some extra disk space usage.
The vast majority of users, especially those in poor infrastructure countries can't/don't run full nodes with today's blocksize and are almost exclusively using web wallets. I'm a bit suspicious of LN, personally, it seems like an overcomplicated and potentially vulnerable solution. I might be wrong, I'm not fully informed on LN so my view is open to debate/change.
I do think we as the community should have more sensible debates about it without mudslinging and extremism as the decision making seems quite centralised at present.

You have to be able to receive mail at that address otherwise you can't verify documentation that is sent when you register a company, I've done the process myself. Your company address has to be factual otherwise it's totally fraudulent and illegal, which a multi-million dollar company has no interest in doing. If they behaved fraudulently, they would feel the weight of the British legal system, which is one of the most robust in the world. 
That is precisely what the reception and security guard would have said to you if they had been instructed to by their client. Bitstamp, or any sensible exchange won't post the address where their main staff and operations are for obvious security reasons. That's the safe way to operate and I commend them for it.
