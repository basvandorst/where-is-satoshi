Tbh, I don`t know is it something that can interest u, but yesterday i`v seen a project going on ICO that will establish Crypto Fiat Bank and I think it`s really cool. It`s FreeZone (freezone.one), well idk what exactly they offer but I think it is worth paying attention if you are interested in something similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:10:43
Any media is shit
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:05:31
u are too categorical 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:02:05
I think he would be wishing to die now.
If I were him, I would wish the same, lol
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:32:54

I have heard about FreeZone project - Free Crypto Economic Zone for blockchain business, it`s a crypto heaven too, and I think that it will work.
If there will be the legislation for regulation, I think it will be absolutely possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:02:40
I think so too, well, we will see what happen) 
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:32:37

Can you please give me a link to it? I can`t find it 
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:50:31
I don`t actually know in detail about Belarus Zone, but as I have seen on their website, FreeZone brings investments. They will spend a huge part of their gained during ICO resources on building infrastructure for blockchain business. None of the blockchain and crypto-friendly areas have such services as they will. Among their own projects are fiat crypto bank, a crypto investment bank, universal trading platform, payment system, and marketing agency.
I think this will form absolutely unique conditions for any blockchain business. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:59:45
You are too categorical. There are a lot of advantages in this kind of banks. You don`t have to use it, but there are people that would like to. Don`t speak for everyone.
