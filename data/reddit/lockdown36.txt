I haven't had issues.

No one is putting a gun to your head and forcing you to use BTC-E.

I'm actually buying tires within the next few weeks, but I like having the convenience of going to a shop and having them installed. =/

Send Bitpay and email. They can have someone on their team log in with Admin privileges, if you grant them, and have woo commerce up and running. I'll check for the guys name when I get into work tomorrow. It worked on my woocommerce website. Www.listacabinet.com

From this direction it looks like a pair of tits.

Wow. I know a lot of those sites.

I actually ate here late January.  I suggested the wait staff to accept bitcoin.  I even sent a follow up email.

What does that mean?

Here's an update.  I messaged Patreon earlier today.
Here was their response:

Same thing happened to me but it was half a BTC and the  value went up 30%.  I thought it was very fishy, coinbase customer support gave me some bullshit and refused to help me.
Even though there is a chance this could happen on circle, I refuse to give Coinbase my money anymore.

I don't even sneak off to the bathroom anymore.

It was cute like the Microsoft/Samsung vs Apple cute.
But when I saw the first 10 posts being WU bashing...meh.

Pretty amazing you know that.

They are targeting the wrong audience. I'd like to think a person who has a partial understanding of bitcoin wouldn't fall for such a scam. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:57:48
I think it's circle.  I only have one LBC account and this got sent to all my email addresses.

I am proud to say: I know OP in IRL.

It is the same for me.
