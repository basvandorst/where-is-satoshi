It's perfectly possible with the caveat that there will be privacy trade-offs, just like there are trade-offs when you use Electrum instead of your own btc node.
The less concerned masses will still be free to connect light XMR wallets to trusted nodes, just as they do with Bitcoin.
"Mobile friendly" wallets are **not** trustless, because they connect to a blockchain that is not your own. This is true for both Bitcoin and Monero.

Perhaps he hasn’t been audited because there’s nothing to audit (he hasn’t been filing).  Do you know if he’s even (personally) earned income since 1998?

A loan isn't income. If he's earned no personal income then he's not required to file a personal return. It sounds unbelievable, but it's entirely possible that his business income is kept in his businesses and not paid out to him as salary or dividend. His lifestyle is simply an accumulation of various corporate perks.

Are you sure the salary was paid to him personally, and not to a corporation he operates? Often times when salaries are reportedly paid to high net worth individuals, the money actually goes to a trust or public entity they control.

Well there you have it. No personal income, no requirement to file.

Except for Nicolas van Saberhagen, who wrote the CryptoNote whitepaper that Monero is based on.
Also, Tom Elvis Jedusor (another anonymous person) wrote the MimbleWimble whitepaper, which is the foundation for the Grin project.

I'm not taking a side in this debate, but I will say that just because things used to function before electricity was a thing, doesn't mean society can gracefully degrade to the way things were. For example, if the internet suddenly stopped working, the world won't just shrug it off and go back to the way things were in 1980. Our communications and business infrastructure would completely collapse. It would be catastrophic, likely dragging us into a dark age where billions of people would starve. And as was already stated, Bitcoin would be the least of our worries.

Actually, the Constitution grants congress the power to COIN money, which nobody else does as far as I’m aware. Words have meanings. 
Do you consider Federal Reserve Notes ”money” or “coin?” According to 12USC411 they are neither. They are debt notes; obligations of the US government.

I'm not sure us "fanboys" want Monero to do all the fancy stuff that Bitcoin does. A lot of us just want to use our p2p money and be left the hell alone. Call us crypto-conservatives!

It's *not* a good point. Everyone who says it's a "political problem not a protocol problem" is ignoring the fact that **the protocol was designed to be a solution to political problems** (hello decentralized money). If we have to solve these issues with political reform then we may as well go back to fiat, because Bitcoin failed.

My response was mainly directed at BTCisGod's comment that fungibility is not a protocol issue.
I think we're in agreement on most of your points. However, it's worth noting that USD's fungibility is centrally enforced, where BTC has no controlling party. Also cash is much more fungible than BTC as serial numbers can only provide so much insight (compared to the complete tx data of BTC's clockchain). 
I do believe BTC was intended to be fungible, but it was understandably difficult/impossible to predict that blockchain analysis would be an escalating concern. However, today it's pretty clear that it *is* a concern, and sidestepping the issue by calling it a political problem doesn't help any of us.

Why are you avoiding the question?
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:29:21
Which points are you talking about, specifically? The one where you referred to Monero's egalitarian PoW as "lol" without explanation? That was a very technical argument indeed. How smart of you.
Perhaps you want a response to your ignorant opinion that any and all inflation is "bad" and stuff. Of course you made no attempt to back up your statements with any reasoning. Good for you.
I'm surprised fluffypony even gave you the time of day, when it was pretty clear you'd claim any advantage Monero has is not an advantage but simply a "design decision." I do agree with you though that Monero has a superior design :)

Banks are required by law to accept the credit of other banks. That was the point of the federal reserve act. Going to the ATM does not change the fact that one bank gave you “credit on account” that you deposited to another bank. The new bank treats your deposit as a *reserve* to create more “credit” to lend to others. That’s why most savings accounts collect a tiny amount of interest.
My previous comment was an oversimplification and may have been misleading regarding physical notes. ATMs only give you federal reserve notes (“credit”). They *don’t* give you coin or lawful money, aka “real money” as I’m trying to describe it. Whether it’s in digital or paper form doesn’t matter.

I’m not aware of any hard money car loans available from retail banks. When you get a loan, the bank’s balance sheet immediately increases by the amount they “lend” you. How could that be?
It’s because the real value is in the contract you sign. That promissory note is a real asset that can be sold at face value. In exchange, the bank gives you “credit” in the form of a check (negotiable instrument) or some numbers added to your account. What they WONT give you is lawful or coin money from someone else’s deposit. In fact, the argument can be made that the true lender is you, and the bank is the debtor, since you’re the only party bringing real value to the transaction. Go figure!

You have stumbled upon a rabbit hole that goes pretty damn deep. Take a look at 12 USC 411:


Read that carefully, as the statute reveals two very important truths. Do you see what they are?
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:27:20
“Reserve money” or “redemption money” are forms of *inelastic* currency; currency that acts as reserve to what’s created. Per your example, if £100 is deposited, then £6,666 in *credit* can be created and lent out, but the original £100 is the *reserve* that stays with the bank. 
Think of it like a gold reserve where the clever goldsmith lends out more gold receipts than he actually has gold to back up. He will continue to print and lend those receipts, but he’ll never lend out the actual gold (the deposits)! That would be stupid!
Of course, modern banking doesn’t usually involve physical gold, but the system functions the same way. The money you give the bank (deposit/reserve money) is not the same kind of “money” the bank lends to others (credit on account). This is why your savings account earns a small amount of interest; because the bank uses your deposits as a *reserve*, allowing them to lend out 20-40 times that amount in *credit*.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:05:25
The bank doesn’t give you money, it gives you numbers in your account. And the guy selling the house or car will be happy to accept it. Are you giving him a suitcase full of cash? No. You’re giving him the same bs “credit” the bank gave you. It doesn’t matter if he uses a different bank or not. 
If you don’t believe me, the next time you get a bank loan, tell the employee you wish to receive the principal in coin or lawful money. The resulting conversation with the bank’s legal department should be quite revealing.
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:00:00
I’m saying that’s not the case. Joe Schmoe’s cash deposit would be the reserve that the banks hold onto. What the banks create out of thin air and lend out is the “credit,” which is *not* the same thing. Banks will never lend hard money. Why would they? That would deplete their reserves and cripple their lending power.
