I didn't write that text but it's a perfectly competent description of the blockchain *for an arts audience*. 
The existing critical response to cryptocurrency has largely been risible. This is an attempt to do something more interesting. It's not an O'Reilly guide or a c4ss pamphlet. So it's addressing a different audience, and trying to bring them towards crypto rather than vice versa.

It's a critically bad choice.
Users of any proprietary software based on OpenBazaar will not be free to examine or fix it.
This destroys trust in OpenBazaar "integration".
Think about the freedom of *all* the users of the software, not just the ability of  a few developers to wall their fellow software users in.

Well that's just wrong.
Namecoin is 2 lines of code in Ethereum...

I'm sure someone will try and lock hardware to the blockchain.
Which is a fantastically bad idea.
But using coins for crowdfunding and as tokens of support/payment and collection for e.g. access to rewards could be awesome.

There were bitcoin flyers, buskers accepting bitcoin, art being sold for bitcoin, and a show of new media art with a bitcoin theme. Seedstock, Dogecoin, the barter platform and the precious metal people showed the range of alternative currencies and helped provide a context for Bitcoin. If vendors are willing to take anything, they'll take Bitcoin. Vendors and buskers accepting bitcoin shows that bitcoin works.
I wandered over to Waves and saw the Bitcoin ATM and Bitcoin mining hardware. There were other events later but I had to leave.
So I feel there was more Bitcoin and more interest to the event than you took away from it. But I do agree with your points 1 and 2.

The original bitcoin codebase wouldn't contradict that. It's basically procedural C with a few stl and Boost bells and whistles.

A secure public record has value in itself without currency.

I was going to buy a Trezor.
Not any more.

It is not "open", the phrase "Open Source" was deliberately chosen to be vague, but the Open Source Definition makes it very clear that look-but-don't-touch licenses are not "open".
Despite the iPod not being Free Software, you can buy plenty of iPod knock-offs from China. Success creates rivals, not the freedom of your purchasers. The difference with Free Software is not that commercial rivals can suddenly copy your products where they couldn't before, it's that purchasers can trust you more and find your products more useful (and therefore valuable, or at least worthwhile).

No, CC licenses are not for software. And this would not satisfy most people here, the software would still not be free.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:04:13
It is, although what makes this worse is that apparently Trezor are trying to pretend they can backdate the change.

The Nano S has a binary blob on it.
I own one and it's great, but it's not free software.

Yes that explains the "I own one and it's great" part of my comment. :-)

The ownership is a proxy. This has already been done. See my Ethereum art market, or Monegraph.

Public key cryptography is the secret sauce here. People can check the signature you create with your private key by just using your public key. No need to reveal your private key.
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:07:43
It's not enforced, no. That's its advantage. It's closer to patronage than policing.
I'm not a fan of DRM but even if we assume it's desirable it's not any more possible with cryptocurrency/crypto 2.0 systems than it is with centralized servers.

The ability to copy software may decrease profits but it can also reduce costs. That's why Apple, IBM, Google and many many other corporations profit based on software that anyone can copy.
Smart contracts and oracles both ultimately have outputs from the outside world. The only difference is how trust is managed.
"Parasite oracles" are both inevitable and worth less than Official Monopoly Oracles. I can subscribe to your oracle and copy the data to my own oracle. You cannot stop that, and if nobody is trying to do it your data is not worth as much as you think. But at the same time anyone using my parasite oracle is aware that I'm copying the data from you. I've already shown I'm less than entirely trustworthy. Now, what was the value of an oracle again?
Once we separate out the social and technical issues, both oracles and smart contracts can benefit from and suffer from copying (reduced revenue/reduced costs) and reputation (trust is value). Proprietary software is no protection against the sharing of data, and it doesn't matter what you call your source of data from the outside world, all that matters is its security and the reputation of its providers.
Which is why Ethereum wins hands down. It's more secure than a random server running hidden code, and proving your trustworthiness is easier in a public arena than in smoke-filled rooms.

(Disclosure for anyone who hasn't read the page: I'm involved.)
This is from an arts organization that has a long history of art &amp; technology projects. They've been working hard to spread understanding of blockchain and crypto technology to their audience for a while now.
The language used in the announcement is more leftish and critical than is usual for the crypto community, but that's not a failure to understand Bitcoin, that's the demands of speaking to a different audience.
For whatever reason, cryptocurrency is a hard sell to people who are otherwise interested in art &amp; technology.  With an an arts audience, acknowledging that "[The blockchain is] nothing more than a ledger distributed across a large array of machines. An apparatus that enables digital ownership and exchange without a central administering body. But from these simple premises, it has been credited with the potential to transform everything, from trade, to cultural production, to the way we’re governed." and excluding essays that are based on "cynicism" is a net win.
So I would argue that it's a different viewpoint with different priorities rather than any kind of ignorance or mythological fear - indeed it's an attempt to tackle those.
But if it's not anyone's idea of fun they don't have to support it and get any of the amazing rewar- OK that was too obvious. ;-)

Wait, the source code to Bitcoin was found in a dumpster?

That's not an accurate description of the project.

No it won't, and having to misrepresent the facts shows that people know this is a problem.
"Look but don't touch" licenses are not "open" - 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:19
Technically true is the best kind of true. ;-)
If people are being mislead into thinking something is Open Source when it isn't, that's a problem.
If people don't understand what Open Source means that's a different kind of problem (  ).
Trezor's clarification that the final license hasn't been chosen yet is very welcome. I'll Fry Meme if Trezor 2 is Open Source, I won't if it just has code repositories that are open for the public to read.
