I've been out to Greece twice in the last year to talk to young people about bitcoin (while at Tor sessions). There is very little interest, and those who did know what it was had also heard of Neo &amp; Bee, so were skeptical. 
Besides, almost all of the people I spoke to were unemployed, and those who did have jobs were working in restaurants and hotels. Not the kind of people able to spare enough money to take a gamble on something the government could ban in a second, and is accepted nowhere for anything of value to them

To answer your specific question about user accounts in Mac OSX, I'm going to say *no* you're not much safer. If a virus or worm compromises your computer because you are running as an admin, then it will have full access to other user accounts, because admin accounts on Mac OSX can easily elevate privileges to root level. 
This is somewhat oversimplified because you have sandboxing and other security applications on the box to deal with.
You can demonstrate this yourself on your Mac by opening a terminal window. Type "whoami" and press enter, and you'll see your username. If you're running as an admin account, you can now type "sudo -s" and press enter, type your password (which won't be shown) and press enter. If you now type "whoami" you'll see that you're a root account, and will have complete access to the system. 
Lizard450's post earlier in response to your question hits the nail on the head - if you do want a computer to use as a hot wallet, make it Linux, encrypted filesystem or a paper wallet.

Translation: We need your passwords stored in a reversible format so that we can access your details, so we've added a new login box that stores your passwords in a new database table in plaintext. In return we'll display a number that may or may not reflect what you had stored on our exchange when we shut the doors.

This is a new proposal from the UK's Conservative (center right) government. Essentially it boils down to the following (and I apologise in advance for my unavoidable liberal bias - it comes from hanging out here too long):
1. The government is aware of people who do not honestly file their taxes, however short of expensive legal action, they are unable to take any of the money. Current UK law requires a court order in order for the government to take money from private bank accounts.
2. In order to rectify this, the government's proposal is that they are allowed to remove money from depositors' bank accounts without aforementioned court order. 
3. KoxziShot's comment above (automatic deductions) refers to most employers paying their staff with deductions (national security/social security, tax, pension, student loan) already factored in, so individuals don't normally have to file tax returns, their taxes are already paid for them. However self-employed, freelance, investors, landlords, people with certain savings accounts etc all have to file their tax returns. 
4. Private companies like Vodafone, Starbucks that pay *no* tax are able to continue operating/making deals with the government, while the proletariat are again unfairly criminalised and their savings put at risk while. Non of the Super Rich, David Cameron's friends or any of the real tax dodgers will be affected, because normal laws don't apply to them. 
I'll stop now.

No experience of BTCJam or the others, but for anyone reading this article thinking "can't Bitcoin do contracts natively?" the answer is *yes*!
Have a look at [this wiki article]( which explains how contracts can make no-trust transactions like money lending, Escrow etc very easy. Mike Hearn [spoke a few years ago]( very eloquently about how the protocol is already able to support working in these ways, however we need clients to take advantage of it. 
One of the best ways to support Bitcoin and drive its adoption is to encourage applications and programs that leverage some of the advanced functionality within the protocol. Worthy developers include [Matt Corallo]( and [Pieter Wuille](

BTC is becoming very popular, you're right. However the 'nodes' on the bitcoin network are run by normal people installing Bitcoin-qt and having it switched on all the time, and the number of nodes is declining. Bitcoin-qt downloads and stores the entire blockchain (at the moment around 16GB), assists in verifying transactions and also serves as a witness for the network, so it is very important to have them. Unfortunately, there is no financial incentive for people to run nodes, so with the cost of electricity and internet bandwidth being what it is, some people are switching their nodes off. In addition, because the blockchain is a large download, there is a high barrier of entry for people who want to run a full node because they have to wait and download the entire blockchain from other nodes before they become a full node themselves. 
People who use online wallets or mining pools will indirectly contribute to a node because the wallet company or pool will have to run a full node as part of their business, however the fewer nodes there are, the more vulnerable the bitcoin network becomes, so it is in everyone's interest who has a stake in BTC to run a node.

Because if they mine at Ghash.io and the pool decides to do something nasty then they will see real return on investment?

Enterprise architect here. 
I get this question a lot. Storage in the cloud is *very* difficult to do well at a budget. For each disk in your array, you need to have that equivalent level of storage failed over and backed up. When you use a VPS, you are sharing physical disks with many other customers who might be running a database or other demanding application, so you need the IOPS (input/output operations per second) that a 15k disk or SSD provides. If that disk fails, it needs to fail over quickly to another so that paying customers don't receive a degradation of service. Whether you failover to hot-standby (an extra disk waiting in case of a failure) or a striped RAID set (other disks in the same array that can self-heal if one or more disks fail), that's more cost.  
RAID-1 isn't backup, so in addition to your $380 disks, you need some form of disk or tape-based backup. You also need to feed and water (power and data) these disks, monitor them, employ staff to maintain them and change them if they break, install HVAC (aircon) to keep them at an appropriate temperature. You need servers to be upgraded constantly to keep up with the market. You also need a company to run all this and make a profit, which isn't as easy as it sounds.
For really cheap VPSs,

I would strongly encourage any UK businesses no matter how small to formally respond to the CFI. 
Information gathering like this is an important tool for policy makers to establish the impact of changes to regulation (or keeping the status quo) on commerce activities, and the CFI makes it clear in a number of ways that keeping the status quo is definitely not off the table. 
As others in the thread have already pointed out, there is a likelihood of some actors whose business model is disrupted by digital currency responding negatively to the technology in their returns to the government, which makes it more critical for business owners, researchers and stakeholders in digital currencies to provide the counterpoint to those arguments by outlining sound reasons for positive government support for the technology.

4400 isn't that much, about $2.7M? The market should be able to absorb that without too much impact. 
Certainly not the 80,000 coins that some media is reporting. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:03:32
Yes and while fraud and criminal behaviours were definitely a factor in this story, the better outcome for the coins is that they are still in circulation and not lost or unrecoverable. 
Some of the other possible theories such as NSA seizure or loss of the private keys weigh on my mind because the loss of that many coins from the available pool might have a deleterious effect on the market whereas their disposal on the open markets keeps them in circulation.

Cloudflare is what's called a Content Distribution Network (CDN). Cloudflare has servers in datacenters distributed throughout the world, and uses clever networking to mitigate the effects of denial of service attacks by routing attacks to other places on its network. This is useful for websites such as 4chan that are routinely attacked, and many large-traffic sites use Cloudflare's massive capacity to serve customers 24/7.
In order to use Cloudflare's protection, you effectively need to move your site and its content into their datacentres. In doing so, if your site is secured with SSL (uses https), you need to turn over your SSL private key to Cloudflare. 
Think of SSL as a clever way of exchanging a message between two people without anyone else being able to read it. You write a message on a piece of paper, put the page in a box and put a padlock on the box, to which only you have the key. You then send your friend the box. Your friend can't open it, because they don't have your key. They then put their own padlock on the box, to which only they have the key, and send the box back to you. You remove your padlock and send the box back to your friend, who removes their padlock and reads the message. At no point has the box been in the post without at least one padlock on it. This is the basis of "private key cryptography," and SSL. Another feature of SSL is that you use a 'trusted third party' (a CA or Certificate Authority) to verify that your private key is genuine. This stops bad people impersonating you by creating another private key and saying it's yours. Unless they steal your private key, it is difficult (although not impossible, but that's another conversation) to make a clone of a private key. 
Now, you can see why it is bad for Cloudflare to have your SSL private key, because they are now in charge of creating messages with your key.  
Some people believe that Cloudflare is an NSA front, or at the very least because they are an American company, can be compelled to hand over anyone's private keys to them. This would allow them to not only pose as you, but also to decrypt information stored on your site, be that email, private messages, transaction details or other private information. In the Bitcoin world where privacy, anonymity and transparency are extremely important, this presents a big problem.

you might be right, but the big drop happened because a huge quantity of BTC was just dropped, and for me that tends to ripple on for a few hours before stabilising as the panicky sellers unload their stashes into salivating buyers' hands and so on.
