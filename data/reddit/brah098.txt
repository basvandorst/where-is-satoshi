Haha I get it but when you see these kind of posts everyday you start to wonder ;)

I'm not sure why this is a big deal? In order for him to buy l, people have to sell out, it's a closed circuit of buying and selling as there is a limited amount.

When he says fixed amount of BTC, is that value or is that coins? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:30:23
Yeah.. again, not my point. You see them as being manipulated, I see it as going up. Neither of us are going to change what we do because of it but it is something that can be observed....

Hmm I see where you're coming from but I have had crypto for 2 years and don't intend on buying or selling so I don't see the point of your rant? It is merely an observation. Clever or stupid can take what they want away from it, doesn't require you to cry about it.    
    
It is what it is....

I was laughing so much tears were shed...

You are under the illusion that the general public understands how it works. This makes it mainstream and presumably more accessible.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:34:21
This needs to be a thing, right?

Big if true

Meh, some people will like it some people won't. Not much more to say.
@_date: 2019-01-24 12:30:50
Big if true
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:32:56
Yeah this really annoyed me... Even with a bunch of writers they can't get it right...

Am I missing something, since when could a bank decide where people can spend their money? Unless it's illegal they can just do one.
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:32:27
Insisting with what? you've lost the plot...

Ok it seems the big dogs have enough crypto, time for them to start a bull run and FOMO. It's an absolute joke. If we want to cripple society we should mass sell, screw up their goals.

Jeez, gripping at straws...
