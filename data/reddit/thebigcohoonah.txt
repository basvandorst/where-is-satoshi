If you are in the United States. I would suggest Coinbase, Bisq or Cash App.
Outside of the United States may be able to use hodl hodl or localbitcoins

Crap...good call, thanks for keeping me in line. Updated the link, but actually a good way to earn some BTC on purchases you are likely already making online.

Since BTC is only 10 years old there is still a lot of development that needs to be done to avoid funds being "locked up" forever. Today, if seed phrases/private keys are not managed correctly a lot of BTC will end up locked up when people pass away. This problem is recognized and there are a lot of services coming out attempting to avoid or fix this issue. 
Some wallets are adapting multi-signature solutions to fix this. Today, in most wallets, to spend your funds/BTC you have have to sign your transaction with your private keys and then you can send the funds. Consider this a 1 of 1 signature, where you need at least 1 of your total 1 keys to spend the funds. With multi signature this could be done with a 2 of 3 signature. Maybe you have a key, you have one in a lockbox and you give one to your best friend. You will need 2 of these 3 keys to spend funds but in the case that you pass away the lockbox could go to your friend and then he would have 2 of 3 keys to access the funds. Additionally if you ever lost one of your keys your friend would have a back up.
In short solutions like these are popping up to solve the issue you are describing but they are not mainstream yet.
