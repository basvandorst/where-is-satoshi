I'd limit myself to only 1% of the market cap. He wouldn't want to effect the price too significantly with his purchase.

Wow people are so uninformed about what US debt is.....

I got schwab, they don't have overdraft fees. ��.

It is? That is so weird.

Nope hedge funds are going to buy so the can find Arbitrage in the futures market on Sunday, expect price to raise for a couple more days. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:58
US taxes are about fiat value though.

Harvest your losses boys.

Brb investing my life savings because the Venezuela government backs their crypto with their oil money.

Yeah the hedge funds aren't in the office tonight. Let's see what things look like tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:57:17
Sold 50 years ago it could. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:20:23
I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:54:38
Anyone else harvest their losses and buy ethereum and litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:13:45
I am wondering.

It was added to coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:55:32
It's going up for a couple more days as hedge funds purchase in order to find Arbitrage in futures market. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:22:51
I thought it was, I guess I am wrong lol.

I would think old money that was born into it would be less willing to risk it. New money knew the process to earn it and could do it again.

It's just not fair to call our modern luxuries to past necessities. Our standard of life has grown incredibly since then.

USA centric point of view but have you thought about capital gains tax? Wait until January 1 to cash out and you can save a lot of money.

They probably ment the derivative, give them a break. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:21
I bought other coins, I think they will move at about the same rate. Now I can report the losses on my taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:16:04
Inflation generally helps the debters. A currency that is design to deflate slightly will probably hurt the poor honestly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:02
I guess that's the cost of time transaction fees and currency exchanges.

The crash seems to have been driven from rumors of insider trading at coinbase. Don't think that would cause the bubble to burst. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:12
