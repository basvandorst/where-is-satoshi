First of all, the barrier to entry is quite large as you either have to be *extremely* charismatic or very, very good at a certain game, and usually both. In addition to that, you're taking a huge gamble in putting in the many, many hours of streaming while very few people watch, gaining followers slowly and hoping to hit it big. Chances are, you'll end up as another viewer-less channel, and you'll have wasted time you could have spent earning money at a different job. 
And I don't know about you, but I get bored after just four or five matches in a day. Career streamers like summit seem to be playing nearly every waking hour; I can imagine that starts to get tiresome. Same game, day in, day out...

I'm one of those people; I run a site that sells Team Fortress 2 items for BTC, and I have a separate Coinbase account that holds only a small amount. In that way, if the site (and the corresponding API key) gets hacked, most of the coins are safe in my personal account.

The plan, I've thought, would be to have a dedicated machine running Debian and Armory that signs transactions over USB stick (never connects to the internet). My sticking point is keeping track of backups and the like.
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:25:48
Do you have a source for that? I'm not doubting you per se, but I've heard both viewpoints and haven't seen any evidence that supports either side. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 03:07:11
He was probably speaking of Debian's stable branch, which only pushes security updates. I believe those repos are still 'behind' on Chromium releases (consistent with the maintainer policy).

Not necessarily. You could try buying some, putting it in cold storage and forgetting about it for 5 years. Even if you bought at the high point in April before the crash, you'd still be in the green today.

Yeah I have Authenticator enabled on everything Bitcoin-related and then some. And yes, they don't have ACH deposits yet, but according to their site, they'll be adding those on the 20th.
I guess I'll start there and see how it goes. Sure wish their site was a little easier on the eye though.

Ordinarily I would agree with you. However the amount of places accepting BTC continues to increase. Once big retailers like Amazon, or even well known single purpose businesses like Subway start taking it, I can imagine that the adoption and velocity will increase a ton. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:13:54
You make a convincing argument... if I buy back all 3.5 BTC now, I'd be $11 ahead thanks to the drop from $230 to $205.
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:23:27
I think what I'm going to do is buy 2.5 BTC back now and the remaining 1 BTC back when/if the bubble pops. Diversify a little bit, a best of both worlds type scenario.

Think about it, why would Bernanke think ill of Bitcoin? As far as he's concerned, it's not a competitor to the US dollar, but a payment protocol and experimental currency that exists alongside the US dollar.
As it stands right now, I think this is about right, but I also think this is apt to change in the future. When it poses a serious short-term threat to the value of the US dollar, both to the citizens that use it and the government that controls it, then we might see some Bernanke-backlash.

For sure, my long term strategy is definitely hold, and keep holding. But I couldn't resist making a little bit more off this bubble we're having. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong; maybe this isn't a bubble but a natural movement forward in price. I'm still a little uneasy because the graph looks almost the same as it did in April, before the $288 to $90 crash.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:34:18
Obviously this happens, but I don't think there's any reason or evidence to believe either of these were sponsored by the government.

IIRC due to SEPA restrictions, they can only send out something like 6 transactions per day. Wire transfers and money orders have to be processed manually. At least that's the story according to what I've seen on IRC.
@_date: 2013-10-24 17:33:27
Yeah I just went on Coinbase and bought 2.5 back. I'll buy the remaining 1 hopefully when the bubble pops.
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:03:08
So are the orders deleted by some kind of anti-spam mechanism or do they just process quicker than the lag estimator thinks?

I see. So instead of the Bitcoin becoming less valuable, we'll see an increase in the difficulty of hashing. So in that case, does it even make sense to buy one of these things? Do we know approximately what the difficulty will be? If we do, we can calculate how long it would take to break even using one of these.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:51:09
* AFAIK, the same place the US does.
* It probably wouldn't fall to 0. Many people wouldn't care about its legality.
* A guy by the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto decided that fiat currency and mainstream banking was bollocks, so he spawned his own form of money with a constant and predictable supply. 
* Yes, I believe Coinbase allows minimum purchases of 0.1 BTC (so $20 minimum from there).
* There's very little rules in terms of what's "allowed" on the Bitcoin network. It depends on the exchange. I bought some when I was 16 through VirWox (this was before Coinbase) via debit card so you should be alright. Try localbitcoins.com maybe?
* Uhhh maybe, maybe not. I personally wouldn't, but who knows. Try dollar-cost averaging.
* I would highly doubt the price will go to $50 at this point. Maybe $175 if we see a correction. Maybe put in an order for $200 and see if it gets filled.
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:57:17
It's both, I think. The question is what's the best way to store coin securely, while also having a quick exit plan, should the price start to head south quickly.
@_date: 2013-03-18 21:58:26
What I meant was the understanding of how mining contributes to the network and the intricacies of how the blockchain functions, transactions are propagated, etc. My missing knowledge was how the hashing difficulty changes dynamically based on what the hash rate is.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:01:48
I used VirWowX when I first cashed into Bitcoin, and I'd recommend staying away from them. I didn't want to deal with wire transfers or any other crap like that, and they were the only exchange I could find that accepted credit cards or PayPal. I regret this somewhat now, as you have to convert your USD to Linden Dollars, and then into Bitcoin, you lose a lot in transaction fees. I bought in when the price was $50/BTC, I spent $37 USD and got 0.6 BTC, which effectively means I exchanged at $62/BTC. 
~~Also be aware they have a minimum withdrawl limit of 0.5 BTC per transaction, so you have to deposit at least $65 by today's exchange.~~
EDIT: apparently they have altered this policy
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:05:04
I sort of agree, but it's in the same vein and I rather like it. I think it'd be a good candidate to run alongside the current one. Maybe we should get a whole series of wizard-themed sloppy-drawing ads going. I'd chip some BTC into that.

Usually a paper wallet (a private key printed on paper, free from data loss and viruses). There are a lot of tutorials on this sub for making one, [here's one from blockchain.info.]( Remember to keep multiple off-site backups!

I'm thinking of making a web app that takes Bitstamp price and lets you pretend to day trade and see how much you suck at it, without paying the real price in BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:46:37
Well you're correct in that regard, but that's kind of a given. Last time the bubble popped at $288 on Gox. My guesstimation is we'll start digging through the $300 wall, won't make it through, and crash back down to $160 or $170, which is about where we were before the bubble. But if I was being cautious, I'd just sell now and wait for the crash. I'm not cautious.
Edit: another school of thought is that we'll suddenly remember the previous bubble and crash at $250. Just be careful is the lesson here.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:31:29

This guy beat me too it. One other tip though, I use Authy instead of Google Authenticator. It backs up all your private keys server-side (encrypted of course, so don't forget your password!), so if you lose your phone you can just install the app on a different one, enter your backups password and you're good to go.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:44:21
On November 20th, CampBX will start accepting ACH withdrawls (to fund your account) just as Coinbase does. They already accept ACH deposits.

Noobs and speculators jump on board looking for a quick pump and dump. The price sees unsustainable growth for a month or two, and at the first sign of trouble, satisfied with their profits, they panic sell and don't buy back in.

The problem with trying to do arbitrage with Gox is that it takes so long to get a deposit out, in most cases you'll make more just by waiting the same amount of time (during which time the BTC price increases) and selling on BitStamp or Coinbase to get your money in a matter of days.
