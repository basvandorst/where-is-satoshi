How could it be successful with Bcash if it doesn’t have segwit? Doesn’t LN require segwit?

Getting them into the exchange is not a problem, the price won't be changing so rapidly that it will matter as long as you use a good fee. You can always use a large fee to get them on there really fast and then sell

I have one too and really like it as well. I definitely want to get a Trezor next, but I just don't understand why nobody suggests KeepKey
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:53:18
Why isn't KeepKey ever included in hardware wallet suggestions?
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:02:39
Then won't this be implemented in KeepKey as well eventually? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:19:22
Who cares? Just HODL and wait it out

What do you mean by a .onion fill node?

The value of both combined will likely be lower than the value of 1 BTC pre-fork, so that's not necessarily a good thing. Depends on who you ask and what happens post-fork though

If nobody used bitcoin to purchase things then it would be useless and therefore essentially valueless. The more it is used worldwide the more its value goes up and the more the network can be developed and improved

Wow thank you! Very well explained, I don't think anyone could've said it better

It's my understanding that trezor and keepkey are open source, so you can look through the entire code to ensure it's security if you'd like to prove it isn't compromised.

I never claimed to, all I said was that you can meaning anybody can if they so desire. Or hire someone to, the point was that it is there and available.

You can create a payment request with amount, address, description, etc embedded into the QR code. I know certain wallets have this functionality built in, I'm pretty sure Electrum has this feature but I'm not sure of any others off the top of my head.

[This site]( kinda does it for you, might be a good start and then you can edit it more yourself. I believe breadwallet is open source so you could also start with that.

I love that argument, gets me every time

It goes up over time, sounds like OP is up to 10k instant, in only up to 2k. I've never requested it or even maxed it out but they've bumped it up since I've buy regularly and have been for quite some time.

Imagine if all of Amazons different sites users were mining for the Amazon pool, they'd probably be doing fairly well even as the difficulty goes up

There is no fee because it's already their system so nothing is completed on chain
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:35:14
This should be a priority
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:44:42
Is it instant?

I'm curious as well, please share if you don't mind

My mistake, thanks for the correction.

Blockfolio is the way to go as the other user said above

I think this comment is short sighted.. the bankers have literally run the world since banks became a thing. Sure there will need to be some sort of financial institution that offers loans to give people extra capital, but it doesn't necessarily need to be the banks that exist today that do so.
"It's no coincidence the era of central banking coincides with the era of total war." -Ron Paul
^Thats all I have to say about "banks being evil"
Anyways.. Bitcoin allows people to be their own bank, and if you can't take the time to learn how to secure your money on your own then, in my opinion, stick to fiat. It's really not that complicated and can be figured out in just a few hours, if securing your wealth isn't worth a few hours of your time then yeah just let a bank do it. I don't trust any bank though. How many times has a high ranking executive for a bank done some illegal shit and instead of going to jail they get let go with a nice hefty severance check? A lot. Why should banks get bailed out after ruining people's lives because they gave them loans they knew they wouldn't be able to pay back? That's not a system I want anything to do with, and I'm sure a lot of people agree with me, which is why bitcoin is such a big deal. Nobody needs to be involved with my money other than me and anyone I want to give it to.

I'm not sure about ripple but litecoin is faster than ether in my experience 
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:50:56
I didn't say they couldn't, but there's no way they'd be able to get any substantial amount of people to use it or get it accepted at a bank, store, website, etc.
Obviously that's different now with cryptocurrencies, but any sort of significant adoption would still be very difficult.

As an engineer these calculators are amazing, but in high school it was overkill indeed

I wasn't aware bitstamp had credit card deposits, I'm gonna look into it as well. I'd like to be able to buy the dip and coinbase doesn't ever want to let me..

Our economy is fueled by debt, here's a great documentary to watch that explains it. It is one of the best documentaries about our economic system in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:25:28
It's not being punished, it's just too expensive at the moment to send a transaction so it's not worth it. Check out litecoin as well, extremely similar to bitcoin but with faster confirmations and lower fees.

Coinbase has been trending every now and then on the AppStore for a few weeks, and the top paid finance app is a crypto price ticker

Well he doesn't claim to be an expert on economics and usually would refer economic questions to someone who has more expertise than he does. But anyways, the documentary doesn't focus strictly on economics it has to do with the correlation between concentration of wealth and concentration of power. He just discusses the US economic system as well and how it relates. 
You seem fairly adamant at this point, but I genuinely believe it'd be worth your time to watch it no matter how you feel about Chomsky and economics. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:08:23
It focuses mostly on the concentration of wealth and power, but if you honestly believe someone of his intellect knows nothing about economics and won't even give it a chance then that's your loss. Whether you think he knows anything about economics or not it would be well worth your time to give the film a chance.

How else would you get masses of people to accept it? You make it so they don't have a choice, which is where government comes into the picture.
