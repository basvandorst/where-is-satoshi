Well if he's selling his bitcoin for USD, isn't that what he's doing?

You've obviously never had a tweaker steal your bike and then help you look for it.

The entertainment factor runs out pretty quick. Then it's just painful.

I think it was supposed to suggest that, contrary to the previous comment, the Fed *is* in fact audited. Nothing more, nothing less.

So basically he's looking for an easy way to cash in on the bitcoins he already has from doing business with cryptocurrency. It doesn't sound like he is a believer in cryptocurrency, it sounds like he made a lot of coin and now wants to turn it into fiat.

Why are you getting down-voted? That was a helpful, practical response...

That's true, and a darknet prostitution marketplace would be a black market run by criminals. Unregulated outside of consumer reviews and totally in the dark. That's not going to stop sex trafficking. Legalizing prostitution and bringing it in to the light might help. But again, a better example of that would be the Bunny Ranch and other legal brothels. Where workers are kept track of and tested frequently.

Haha, point taken ;)

I don't think it would make a difference, no. If someone or some group of people runs a girl or a group of girls, customer reviews aren't going to help. You think the girl is going to tell the john that she is under duress? And that the john then will write about that in an online review? If she does she gets disappeared and said person or people just open up shop under a different name. Also darknet marketplaces are NOT open, the are anonymous, that's the point. An open marketplace for prostitution would be a place like the Bunny Ranch where all the players are known and held accountable. You are basically arguing to trust the free market to protect against sexual slavery and abuse.

That's the thing about prostitution, in most situations you don't know if someone is being coerced. And the few freelance prostitutes I've met would have no idea how to operate .tor safely. On the other hand, groups that are already involved in .tor illegal activity would flock to it.

To make sex trafficking easier? I'm all for consensual sex, prostitution or otherwise, but sexual slavery is a very real thing and a darknet for prostitution would benefit organized rings, not individual girls looking to make a few bucks.

Made me think of the Egyptians, it's an interesting theological question. If you believe that you can take wealth into the afterlife, can you also send it back to world of the living? What does one do with one's wealth in the after life? Are there good investment opportunities? If there were, and you were to send ghostly cash back to the living, would that contribute to inflation here on earth? So many questions...
