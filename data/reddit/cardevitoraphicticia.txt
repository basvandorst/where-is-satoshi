From now on, you should qualify that question with "for whom".

Given what he posted a couple days ago, I think it's going to be a real snooze.

hahaha... dream on.  TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:24:04
yep - it's crazy.  It peaks to that level sometimes, but now it's pretty sustained.  At least until more people hear about it and jump in...
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:54:37
Does anyone have some Eligius addresses to test?  I'm looking to prove my suspicion that they were laundering money for DPR thru Gox...
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:38:14
"apparently" you can still withdraw EUR/JPY with some delay, so there is opportunity to arb.  maybe...
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:18:57
So... what does that mean in terms of max number of transactions per minute for the overall system?
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:44:32
Actually, the prospect that the hot wallet could have been emptied multiple times via the double withdrawal exploit he talks about makes me even less calm.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:22:47
Because it creates a negative customer experience if a customer buys bitcoins in order to buy playboy, and then gets killed on the current downtrend.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:42:41
ah, which actually means they need to liquidate those coins on another exchange... ouch.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:28:37
It would take 2-3 quarters to get listed, assuming approval is without issue.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:41:04
no. I don't care engouh.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:41:49
I recommend putting at least some of it on Bitfinex.  You earn interest on the coins that you leave there and if you have enough, the interest can be significant.   Obviously, there's the risk of another Gox, but the founders are much more transparent, and the interest rate paid is high enough that it's worth at least some risk.
Full disclosure:  I trade on bitfinex so I benefit from more people keeping their coins there.  But in fairness, while I'm not trading, I lend my coins there as well.  Interest paid by traders ranges from 50% annually to almost 250% during high volume days, which is totally worth the risk (for a small portion of your coins).

Same thing happened to me almost exactly.  pm me your email, I have some info on filing to the bankruptcy court.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:12:34
Again, that only shows that they are being split to smaller addresses.  It doesn't show that they've left Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:21:29
Your assumption is not correct.  I've been a developer for 22 years.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:16:00
yeah, like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are fighting to lower fees...  dream on.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:47:15
There are two kinds of bankruptcy.  Reorganization vs liquidation.  In either case, you need protection from bill collectors/customers/etc, while you figure out what you're going to do.
The court ultimately has to agree to your payback plan to allow you back out of bankruptcy.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:49:54
it could just be that they loaded their hot wallet in order to transfer the coins to an external exchange to pay for non-descrationary expenses allowed by the bankruptcy court (ie lawyer fees, rent, and employee salaries).  They aren't allowed to resume business without a court ruling - definitely not withdrawals.
Their hot wallet's default behavior is to split up the coins, and I suspect they just didn't bother deactivate that when transferring from cold storage.
If they've transferred out coins to sell for costs, we should see those sales materialize elsewhere at some point today - I think that fear is bringing the market down at the moment.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:23:05
Or it was Eligius that was behind the attack...
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:52:42
This is the screen cap that boiled my blood this morning. I woke up at 3am to trade on the Gox announcement only to find out that some insiders had gotten preferential treatment 4 hours earlier. In the real world, Mr Karpeles would be in jail for this kind of blatant insider bullshit. 
Any illusions that we should trust MtGox or that they are not themselves trading on their platform, should already be gone, but just in case you have any remaining shred of impression that they aren't letting their friends and family cash out preferentially - just take another look at that screen capture. 
To be clear, the payout on that one price movement would net at minimum 2.5 million in shorts profit on Bitfinex, plus 10 million in carry-over to Stamp/Coinbase. They are likely doing this time and again more subtly every day. The blatant nature of this trade makes it obvious that we're nearing the end.
Gox insiders are robbing us. And I don't just mean Gox customers. They are screwing the entire market.

@_date: 2014-03-08 16:37:54
You are not answering the question.  The question is, how does the API differentiate the internal spliting, from transfers going external to Gox.  I am assuming it keeps a record of all of it's internal addresses.
What we're looking for is confirmation that this report is saying the coins have left Gox's wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:15:31
...but their customers still take the risk.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:05:20
No one is arguing with you.  My point is that that is the US Gov't strategy.

Bitcoin suffers from incredibly high volatility because it is *de*flationary.
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:34:26
Agreed.  But to be clear, is it totally fixed?  Are malleable transactions gone, or did we instead create a temporary work around to survive the DDOS attack?

not at all.  read the indictment.  They specifically say we're going after those that pretend to turn a blind eye.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:22:34
It is limited for dos reasons, but also because the system simply can't scale about ~20-100 anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:40:52
Yes - just percentage of recently mined blocks.  It's always a guess.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:35:22
Technically, it is possible, but very difficult.  It would require a hard fork in the code that would mean that the repossesion would have to occur at a future set block.  It's unclear if we'd be able to track the coins to that future block and unravel all the earlier transactions.  I'm pretty sure it's impossible if you assume the coins will be put through a joiner, gambling site, or exchange.
Politically it would be almost impossible to convince 51% of miners to accept this.  Much of the value of the currency is it's immunity to this sort of manipulation so they'd be putting *your* money ahead of their own gains.
If Jesus was being held hostage in Mordor, it *might* happen, but otherwise, I'd kiss those coins goodbye.
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:33:15
So that added 50 BTC to their account?
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:22:47

Actually, it was poorly structured and overly verbose.  It was written to *sound* educated, but it wasn't.

The real underlying issue here is that mining has become so centralized, that there are only a handful of mining pools running the whole show.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:11:57

That's what he filed with the court.  The other two possibilities are that he's a thief, or the US gov't has them.  Either way, they're going to be liquidated on the market.  Gox is giving people their money back.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:36:41
We don't know that yet.  It could be that people exploited it be sending immature coins through and cycling the process at infinity.  Even a small leak can be leveraged.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:05:12
I know, but it's always good to have an open mind.  Hiding everything under the bed isn't the professional advice.  Diversify.
@_date: 2014-04-28 10:40:27
The centralization of mining pools has really killed the "decentralization" of the block chain.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:29:16
It's tough to match incentives and eliminate any gaming of the system.  For example, if people "mine" based on traffic throughput, they would be incentivized to just manufacture traffic - plus traffic in just one part of the network is not easily verifiable.
I think the idea of paying upfront for data, and then allowing subsequent nodes to wrap that same request minus their "cut".  Then each nodes signs their new request layer with their key, and each response data is then also signed to ensure only the previous node can unlock payment.  This provides both encryption as well as payment, but obviously has some overhead...
So the response route must always be the exact request route.  Actually, maybe this would mean there's no UDP (stateless)? hmm...
...and of course there's the economic issue of inflation (which is a *must* unless you want to end up like bitcoin).  Since there's no central ledger (and can't be) there's no way to mine against it. And any distributed bandwidth based mining is easily gamable.  Tough problem...
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:47:55
I would argue that broadcasting 10Mbs to every single person with a wallet is simply not a scalable model.  Also, think about how much more it would grow to if we included financial instrument transactions.  The network activity needs to be fragmented.
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:30:10

The difference is that you aren't lending to the exchange - you are lending to traders, and the exchange insures the deposits.  i.e. the exchange is not making money off the loans, so it's in their interest to keep everyone solvent.

Local drug dealers buy bitcoins with the drug cash they have.  It is the best way to get rid of the piles of cash.  They then used the coins to rebuy drugs in bulk via silk road (or now, by going direct to those they met on silk road).

@_date: 2014-03-01 16:02:35
FYI - best way to increase the number of bitcoins you have is to put them in an interest bearing bitcoin account at Bitfinex.  You essentially allow margin traders to use coins to make trades, and they pay you back your bitcoins plus interest.  (and no, you take no risk - you are not exposed to trader losses).
With all the Gox mess, the **interest rates have shot up to 50%**.  Can you imagine making 50% **in addition to watching your bitcoins go up in value?**
Bitfinex is now the  largest exchange, and by far the most innovative.

Right now we're in the bust cycle, which I think will take us below $100.  Will we ever hit $800 again?  All things staying the same, I would say yes, but I suspect that a new crypto will take over that doesn't have this flaw before the next boom cycle.

You can ignore the demand, it never fills from there.  The fills come in at the flash rate, for the most part.  The rate varies wildly depending on the market direction.  It was at 1% a couple days ago.
Remember, that's a DAILY percentage return.  At one percent per day compounded every other day, it's almost 500% return per year.  ...1% is not realistic to get reliably, but even 0.1% (which is reasonable) is in the triple digit percent returns.  
Think about in the context of junk bond on Wall St which are considered "high risk" and only pay 20% PER YEAR.

Unfortunately, it's not exactly correct because exchanges like Coinbase &amp; BitPay are providing more than just exchange - they clear transactions and hold bitcoins.

Quite honestly, I'm not sure why this community thinks that economists know less about the financial system than a veterinarian.   Most do not work for the central bank, and are ofter pretty open minded.  Many even love bitcoin and are pretty well informed about it.

Having worked with the SEC in the past, I can tell you, this is the absolute worst way to deal with them.
You don't need to cooperate, but a response like MP's actually solidifies for the SEC that MPEX entirely intends on obstructing any investigation and is likely involved in less than legal activity themselves.  It is foolish to think that the SEC alone is investigating MPEX et al, or that they will allow MPs notion of jurisdiction hold them back from shutting them down and listing them as accomplices in money laundering investigations...
In fact, I have to wonder if the email from the SEC wasn't really just a tactic to help locate MP physically.  They are rumored to be in Romania, which is not a legal safe haven.  But wherever they are, I'm certain the FBI already knows where and who they are.  It's only a matter of time...

I recommend putting at least some of it on Bitfinex.  You earn interest on the coins that you leave there and if you have enough, the interest can be significant.   Obviously, there's the risk of another Gox, but the founders are much more transparent, and the interest rate paid is high enough that it's worth at least some risk.
Full disclosure:  I trade on bitfinex so I benefit from more people keeping their coins there.  But in fairness, while I'm not trading, I lend my coins there as well.  Interest paid by traders ranges from 50% annually to almost 250% during high volume days, which is totally worth the risk (for a small portion of your coins).

The easiest thing to do is set it at the flash rate for a longish duration (30 days).  You can set some higher in case someone wants more at a higher rate.  The autorenew happens when the loan finishes, and it prevents you from having to log back into the website to re-loan it.  Again, flash rate is least amount of maintenance.

You don't lose anything if the trader loses.  If the trader's position turns against him, the difference comes out of his balance and he gives you back your full bitcoin.  If his trade becomes so unprofitable that he's at risk of not being able to pay you back, then the position is liquidated automatically by Bitfinex and you are paid back in full anyway.
The only real risk is if Bitfinex itself goes bankrupt.  ...but my experience with Bitfinex has been very professional, and they are very conservative/paranoid.  They've been limiting margin on traders just to ensure they don't approach liquidation.  They are now the  exchange.  There is also an additional insurance fund you can lend through if you're still nervous, which takes 1/5th of the interest you make, but it has never been used.  No lenders have been defaulted on thus far.

I'm not so sure I'd be comfortable being in a US jurisdiction.  In my case, I use Bitfinex.  Being in Hong Kong, they aren't subject to any major government and have a very professional business "offshore" like feel.  The best part is that it's the only exchange that allows you to earn interest on your bitcoins while holding them there.
Bitfinex is the  exchange now, and they are definitely the most innovative.
At the moment, due to all the Gox fallout, interest rates have skyrocketed to 50% on both bitcoins and USD.  Try to imagine - you get to 50% **in addition to watching your bitcoins grow in value**.
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:15:16

This is why the devs agreed to have confirmations respected - because you can't trust transactions without them.

While it's good to shove it in their face, there are more savy ways of putting your bitcoins to work.  Just ignore the fools in your life - you'll be much happier.
I recommend putting at least some of it on Bitfinex.  You earn interest on the coins that you leave there and if you have enough, the interest can be significant.   Obviously, there's the risk of another Gox, but the founders are much more transparent, and the interest rate paid is high enough that it's worth at least some risk.
Full disclosure:  I trade on bitfinex so I benefit from more people keeping their coins there.  But in fairness, while I'm not trading, I lend my coins there as well.  Interest paid by traders ranges from 50% annually to almost 250% during high volume days, which is totally worth the risk (for a small portion of your coins).
My referral code to get you a discount on trading fees:  
Bitfinex is now the  exchange and has over 15 million USD and 12K BTC in active loans.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:43:15
I think it's much more likely that they were simply robbed and are unwilling to come clean.  I think it's fairly easy to imagine them losing enough BTC via the "double withdraw exploit" over enough day that they didn't realize they were under-capitalized until recently.
Now, they simply don't have enough money to pay people back and are hoping that traders keep trading in their accounts to create fees for them to eventually bail themselves out.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:44:08
oh no - you can also just disrupt the network in general.  Short the market, and make millions.  ...and I doubt the founders would do it, but that literal kalashnikov to their heads can be pretty motivating.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:40:00
I think you mean 15%.  But yeah, while some of them are miners, it's likely some pools may hide some of their real network.

@_date: 2014-03-01 22:12:55
That's true.  Like any exchange or bank account.  The nice thing here is that at an interest rate of over 50%, you would be making interest quickly enough to offset that risk.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:53:42
Actually, Overstock is doing terribly.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:10:33
Not at all.  All they'd need is to manually replay the transaction with a modified field, and around 50% of the time their transaction would win.

It's definitely more orphans, but the network still works fine.  Moreover, one might argue that the goal of a transaction system is transaction speed &amp; reliability, not mining efficiency.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:01:18
Bitfinex going under is the biggest risk.  They are now the  exchange, amazingly.  It's hard to gauge that risk, but it certainly isn't as high as the interest you'd get.  Of course, you should only put in a limited portion of your coins - diversification, as they say.
The market risk is up to you.  You can buy the insurance on the lending (for a portion of the interest) and that makes you immune to even the harshest flash crash.  Even if you don't get the insurance, the risk is extremely low.  Only a flash crash would cause traders to liquidate faster than they could pay back margin but Bitfinex have in the past stopped trading in those circumstances, so the risk is very very low.  Margin of 15% is kept on all accounts to allow for liquidation of the trader before he gets near the point where he can't pay the loan back.

I work on a Wall St trading system, and the idea of having a transaction ID that changes and having to match orders by price/quantity/timestamp, makes me want to vomit.
If this is accurate, this is a sad sad state of affairs for the bitcoin protocol.  Moreover, if the Bitcoin devs think this isn't even in the top 10 problems, then I don't even know what to think...

Having "only a couple nodes" in Africa is depletion.  It means that propagation and network fragmentation in those areas is at risk.
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:17:15
Well...  I guess I mean that you are not at risk to the market flux.  If the traders on Bitfinex screw up, you still get all your bitcoins, plus interest.  
...but you are right that you are still exposed to Bitfinex itself being seized.  The reason I think this is low risk is that it is based in Hong Kong which is not going to shut down a company bringing money in - and the founders are not anonymous and actively trying to figure out a way to do what many are asking - prove solvency on the blockchain.  But, you're right, the counterparty risk is not zero.
Having said all that, the interest being paid is over 50%, which means you'd need to be *really* suspicious of them to not put at least some of your coins there.  For some holders with &gt;250 coins, you can basically live off the interest alone.

I can think of a few more requirements...
1.  We should have voting shares where a majority of share are issued to existing customers (of which Mark is one).
2.  We should have majority representation on the board.
3.  Shares should pay set dividends as soon as Gox has recapitalized our account.
4.  An end to insider trading an document leaking (and termination of employees that previously engaged in such activity).
5.  An understanding that Mark will step down after the re-org.
6.  A agreement to have the financial statements and accounts of the company quarterly audited by an accredited auditor.
The big catch is that this will need to be signed off on by a judge in Japanese bankruptcy court to shield Gox from creditors/customers that don't want to participate in this plan, and instead want to sue directly for their money.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:10:53

@_date: 2014-02-28 16:24:13
It isn't even in his power any more.  Once you declare bankruptcy, all assets will be part of the reorganization/liquidation plan and it will be up to the judge to determine who gets what (after negotiations).  It would be absolutely impossible for BTC holders to get their coins out before the whole company is chopped up.

@_date: 2014-02-12 14:49:43
no, we can't.  That's the point.  Bitcoin protocol can't handle that many transactions, so no retailer is going to accept direct payments.   We're all going to have to pay the 5% fees on Bitpay / Coinbase.
...and in case you think I'm exaggerating on the "5%", I'm not.  Look at the bid/ask spread they use.  Between that and the official 1% fee (compounded of course), buying and selling BTC is well over 5%.

You see, the volatility of Bitcoin is still a *major* problem for the customer experience and retailers don't want the customer to have a bad experience.

There has been discussion of it before, it is *plausible* (meaning that it has never been proven to be impossible), but has never been demonstrated.
...it would also be a very important cryptography breakthrough, so I wouldn't be surprised if certain agencies have been working on it and that that mathematician has privately take advantage.

Wait, so the seller needs to put up a bond of 100% of the transaction value?  That seems a bit much.  Then sellers will need to keep on hand 200% total capital as inventory (in the form of product and cash in clearing).  That is not appropriate for many industries, and certainly not for large property one-off transactions.  Plus, it'll depend on the venue of the transaction.  If the buyer and seller are familiar, they may choose to accept a lesser risk, and should have that option.  ...or it could even be more than the transaction value (which makes the penalty bigger than the transaction, which might be functional for more complex transactions).
Another question...  For each of the steps outlined in posting and releasing bond - is there a time-limit?  Like, do these operations expire at some point if the counterparty fails to perform the next step?  Like, will party A's bond post, and then party B disappears, does party A get the bond back, or is it all wrapped in one transaction?
Also, is this being implemented as an independent network from BTC, or is there some way to register the structure of the transactions within the existing BTC blockchain in order to leverage the existing network?

@_date: 2013-12-02 20:10:31
wait wait wait...  You are starting at 1%.  I would argue, that's still crazy far away!  You should start this chart where Bitcoin is today.  What percentage of Gold has been displaced by BTC?  What percentage of foreign high inflation currencies and money supply have been displaced by BTC?   This table needs the first few rows to be realistic numbers like 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%.  Starting at 1% is still a HUGE success outcome for BTC.

The one thing it doesn't cover is how change addresses and paper wallets work (...and I still don't entirely understand).  I'm a little worried about printing a paper wallet and then discovering that I lost my savings because I sent a transaction after I made the backup.
I'm assuming that every address has a private key that gets printed on the paper wallet, but if you deposit to a new address, or you send from any of your addresses, that money is given a new address (with a new private key), that needs to be backed up again, right?

Right - think about that.  The way to insulate yourself from bitcoin, is not to use it.  ...and remember, this completely ignores all B2B payments, and reintroduces something all merchants hate - creditcard like service providers.
Additionally, if all commerce uses services like bitpay, then very little currency needs to exist in the economy to make transactions, because most coins are returned to the exchange almost immediately.  That makes the M1 multiplier so high, that bitcoin's intrinsic value goes to sub-$10.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:35:46
...but isn't this a bit of a lie?  I mean, up until recently, the largest single marketplace for Bitcoin was SilkRoad.  And while I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast, it would be a falsehood to claim that it isn't an excellent medium for illegal transactions and tax avoidance.
People say that it's less efficient than using cash - well, that's only true if you're willing to haul around briefcases of cash - and if you're an international criminal, then no, it's definitely easier to use Bitcoin.
I just feel like if we're not honest with the senator, he's going to get the "straight talk" today and get caught off guard. 
So what's the truth?  Bitcoin is neither good, nor evil, like any new technology.  But the proper money transfer laws need to be put in place to prevent the unregulated transmission of capital in/out of the United States.

There is still some degree of Nash equilibrium problem here in that a buyer can choose to never settle the transaction (out of spite).  ie. maybe the seller was rude, or refused to accommodate him in some fashion after he received his goods, so he decides he'd rather destroy the payment than see the seller get it.
The solution is to lock some additional amount that goes back to the buyer to make a spiteful act much less appealing.  So the buyer has to put up eg 110% of the payment in order to close the transaction, and then gets back the extra 10%.  This amount of "deposit" can should be set by the seller in the initial listing as it will likely be variant depending on the type of goods, the price, and the venue the transaction is being conducted.

minor detail.  bully bully bully!
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:12:59
I'm not sure I understand why it needs to be 100% for nash eq to work.  I'm assuming that if the transaction is never settled, then the amount in escrow is effectively destroyed price + bonds.  So the buyer will always lose at least the 100%+bond anyway, and the buyer loses the product+bond.
If seller doesn't deliver, buyer loses payment+bond.  If buyer doesn't confirm, seller loses product+bond.  I don't see why it would matter if bond is 10% or 100%.  The motivation is still there for both to complete.

My point is that the currency, in your example, is more valuable to you - but the thing is that it is less valuable for your counterparty.  So your argument does not impact the value of the currency at all.  What you are arguing is the value of not using an escrow transaction service - it has nothing to do with currency.

@_date: 2013-12-02 16:56:20
Looking at the model, I think it is correctly calculating the money supply value of Bitcoin (based on my shitty econometrics background).  But it needs to factor in the likelihood of this level of Bitcoin penetration.  Will Bitcoin really capture 20% of all foreign currency reserves, plus 20% of all money supply in high inflation nations, plus 20% of all gold-based financial assets???  By NEXT YEAR?!?!? (that's the last box).
That seems like a bit of stretch.  Even if it gets there in 20 years, it will only be 10x profit for current holders.  Whereas it is easy to see BTC hitting $100 again.
I actually think this analysis demonstrates that Bitcoin is at a local maximum given the percentage of the current transactions that are speculative vs commerce driven.

The REAL VALUE is highly debatable.  Let's just say that the REAL PRICE is about $120.  Buy it on CampBX.com via a Dwolla account and you should be fine.

How can you use it in commerce if you can't buy/sell items with bitcoin?

Having said that, laundering $200 million in cash is still incredibly difficult.  If one were to devise a way to say mix coins via a gambling site, it might be a very tempting way to launder indeed.
Why do you guys think the bitcoin gambling sites are so popular and have such good odds (nearly 50/50)?

*only* 1%?  That's *only* several trillion dollars in annual commerce.  Have *you* ever bought anything with bitcoin? No? me neither.

The huge debt is actually *why* the US government *wants* to devalue the USD.  Inflation is great to minimalize the debt.

No, most the BTC were ~$10 at the time of sale, you cannot price them at current market value.
