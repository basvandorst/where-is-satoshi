No, it's a VERY fair deal.  Wake up to the reality of this situation.
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:38:15
I can tell many on here don't have much experience in the business world.  Why would a private or public company crash it's market cap and face criminal consequences for 25% of the real value?  It is VERY much in BFX's best interest to pay everyone off in full as quickly as they can.  
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:14:00
Keep thinking that.  Who do you think is on the other end of that trade?  Someone is buying up the debt.  Bitfinex has EVERYTHING to lose by not honoring their debt.  It is the only way they survive.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:27:58
Zero "assumptions" on my end.  This I guarantee....... No need for this discussion to go round and round, but feel free to drop me a message when this happens.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:21:03
I know of several folks who are buying the tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:11:39
Todd,  just as I stated yesterday.  There are many emotional people on here and many of their paranoid posts are laughable.  Yes, we deserve some transparency sooner rather than later, but I think BFX has handled the situation very well in a short period of time.  My opinion is based on what I know thus far.  Sell me your BFX tokens folks.  I will gladly buy anyone's tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:54:15
I disagree based on how they handle this situation.  These are risks we are aware of.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:35:52
I don't need 1,000, but 38 would be great as that's how much I lost at BFX.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:11:01
Final note......Please don't cry and moan when BFX makes everyone whole and you sold out on the cheap.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:11:56
Of course it sucks, but you have the chance to have all your funds returned with time via future profits.  This outcome is very reasonable imho.
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:49:40
Nope, not looking for someone to inflate my ego, as it died a long time ago for the most part.  I do have a massive amount of experience regarding public and private companies via my past career.  I don't think I'm better than you or anyone else for that matter, however I think people should tune in those who are "in the know."
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:23:40
Great post!  
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:13:10
 Hi Zane,  Has Bitfinex thought about selling equity, and/or giving an equity stake to those who lost funds as an option to remain solvent.  Thank you and keep up the great work!
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:33:54
agreed and my resume supports our views.  This is a company issue, and it will/would impact ALL customers in the court of law.
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:47:14
I'm totally on board with the current arrangement, however I would change one aspect.  Everything I had at BFX was in BTC and I would prefer my 65%  (can't remember the exact %) returned in BTC if possible.  I suspect BTC price will get pushed up in anticipation of the BTC buying via BFX customers.  A BTC price over 604 would simply be additional salt on a painful wound.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:15:39
I HIGHLY suspect it will pay off dearly.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:49:44
Thanks for being available Zane.  Did all margin positions get sold off several hours ago?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:37:51
Agreed and it's possible we come out ahead once the dust settles over the coming months.  You know Finex will become Ft. Knox going forward.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:43:04
Yes, I like the idea......
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:16:16
And they will survive.
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:05:18
I totally understand you cynicism as history supports your beliefs.  That said, the stake holders at BFX know they have the best $ BTC exchange out there and they are a cash cow.  Many interested parties approached BFX for an equity stake in the past, however BFX wasn't interested.  They know their reputation is EVERYTHING and the only way to unlock future value involves making their customers whole again.  There will be interesting news in the coming weeks and you'll have a better picture.  
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:46:34
Good luck with that.  You will lose additional money paying lawyer fees and any legal recourse would take YEARS!  Look at Gox for an example.  How has that worked out?  I'm guessing many of you are fairly young and naïve.  
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:14:05
Do you think those bidding .37 for "toxic debt" are doing so blindly?  A lot of tokens have traded hands and many of those buying are in the know.  Lets leave it at that.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:33:37
Agreed.......  I suspect most BFX tokens have now moved into stronger hands who see the potential.  It all boils down to risk vs. reward.  I still see 150% of possible return at the current BFX price.
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:36:13
The emotional and weak holders are gone as the tokens have traded well over 10 million now.  I suspect the reverse will happen.  More buying interest will come in as people start to realize that BFX will make good on this debt.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:08:36
Thanks Todd.  People have every right to voice their opinion nd be upset, but the level of emotion and hate is a bit much.  I think BFX has done every thing they could to make a crappy situation a lot less crappy.  I'm more than happy to buy everyone's BFX tokens.  I have several bids sitting there waiting to set you free from your misfortune.
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:15:30
Ok, that makes ZERO sense/cents, but have at it.  Make those lawyers happy and keep your blood boiling for a lot longer.  I don't believe there is any criminal activity on their end.  I HIGHLY suggest you don't waste your funds on something that will only make you more frustrated with time.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:22:20
Kind of excited about the BFXcoin.  I would like to own a piece of Bitfinex despite this event.
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:32:57
And thank you for your service.  I mean that as well as I admire and respect every man and woman who puts on the uniform.
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:28:10
You are wrong on too many fronts to have this discussion.  Now you're saying BTC is dead and used primarily for illegal activities.  Listen, I out ranked you X 10 when I served and I have a long past in the business world.  You need to do more dd on topics you know little to nothing about.  Move along and try to get to E5 meritoriously.  Take advantage of the free college classes while you're at it.  I'm being sincere when I say that.....
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:11:52
The handful of stakeholders at BFX have EVERYTHING to lose in the outcome.  Trust me, they will get a lot less $ via an equity investment vs. 3 weeks ago, but a decent chunk of the company will be owned by others in the not too distant future.  The repayment plan has three segments and they know they must return equity as quickly as possible.  The coming weeks will tell the tale......
@_date: 2016-08-21 15:45:46
It's the ONLY chance of getting 100% of our funds back.  There are NO other options, however many are too clueless to understand this fact.  Some are even ignorant enough to talk legal action.  Wake up people!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:30:31
Well done Bitfinex and thank you for your tireless effort Zane.  I think this outcome is VERY fair and reasonable for all parties.  My business will remain with Bitfinex as a result.  I have traded well over 100,000 coins this year alone.
@_date: 2016-08-21 21:37:12
Ok there fella.  Yeah, Bitfinex has been running a 3 year long Ponzi.  You are clueless.......
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:03:46
I hate to take money from an enlisted man though.
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:43:56
I do my dd on EVERYTHING.  Nothing creepy about accessing information that is readily available.  My past service to the country will most likely take much of my future from me, and I'll leave it at that.  My business background speaks for itself and you would most likely follow my advice if you knew my back ground.  Send me your email via private message and I will give you a free lesson. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:19:57
Agreed!  For me, it's BFX or sitting on idle coins.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:47:06
I will continue to use them if they make good on this situation.
@_date: 2016-08-22 00:02:06
You will see.........  Care to make a wager?
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:57:59
Hope isn't a strategy.  Bitfinex realizes they still have real value and they will sell a fairly large equity stake to go towards making everyone whole.  They will also allow some token holders to become equity holders and the remainder 1/3ish will come from future earnings.  Bitfinex will make a payment in the coming weeks and this will go a long way towards reestablishing customers trust.
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:38:40
The solution will most likely come in 3 segments:
1-  Converting accredited investor's tokens into equity (for those who are interested).
2-  Outside investment to pay down the current obligation.
3-  Profit sharing for the remaining tokens.
I suspect BFX will bounce back quickly and draw more trading as people will trust the exchange like no other.  This is not only feasible, but it's probable.  Stockholm Syndrome my arse........
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:17:31
You are comparing apples and oranges.  I realize GOX remains fresh on people's minds 2.5 years later, but this no GOX.  Bitfinex will make it's first payment to token holders within the next 6 weeks.  Sit back and learn......
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:36:57
True,,,,, You can't screw customers out of their funds and continue to run the company without sharing future profits.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:49:41
No, I needed to provide various forms to proceed with a loan.  Yes, it's easy to lend with BTCJAM, but not as easy to borrow.  You have had a good experience with bitlendingclub so far?  If so, please elaborate.....
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:41:00
That's ashame, but it's a free country.........
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:39:50
I agree with your move since you're young and you can bounce back.  I give you a big thumbs up!
@_date: 2014-11-09 03:46:12
I have finded several today and I will report my results to everyone.......  Multiple media outlets as well.  I have about 23 varying sized loans to mostly B and up borrowers.....
@_date: 2014-11-09 04:00:18
I have multiple loans outstanding as of today.  I will share the results over the next 3 months.....
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:17:04
I've seen the note feature.  You sold your overdue note for a return of your original investment?  I know BTCJAM has some kind of collection agency as well, but I've read conflicting opinions about the agency.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:16:34
Wow, that is too cool.....I now have $1 of Bitcoin in my account..... This will help me demonstrate the power of Bitcoin!  Thanks.....
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:35:55
Newbie question here....What is a network fee?
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:53:23

@_date: 2014-11-07 00:26:50
How do you tip back?  I'm still learning.....
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:25:33
Seriously?  Thank you so much.  I loved Bitcoin, but now I'm a phanatic as this feature is crazy cool and possibly life changing for some.
@_date: 2014-11-07 15:50:46
Hmmmm, there must be a way to send the donor some kind of receipt.  I realize many wouldn't care, but donations to nonprofits can make a difference on your tax returns.  I will get her foundation onto coinbase this evening and go from there.  I'm also thinking about asking her to call a couple newspapers for the publicity of Bitcoin and her nonprofit.  She's located about 30 minutes outside of DC and she's minutes from the tech heavy area of Northern Virginia.
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:31:21

@_date: 2014-11-07 02:34:15
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:39:47
I will!  Thank you so much.....
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:39:53
It's my personal list, but it's a fairly large with some open minded people.
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:51:54
well, my current (it already activated) loan is only 2 Bitcoins for 30 days.  I will possibly list another one after I pay this one off.  Let me know if you're interested, but it will be a traditional loan that doesn't change with bitcoin fluctuation.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:22:27
This is truly amazing and simply one way to help others and make a difference.  I will try to buy a coffee with my tips.  Thanks everyone and I will pass this along to the masses.........  (the masses being my friends and family).
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:25:07

@_date: 2014-11-06 22:33:37

Easy there killer.......  This is my wife you're talking about.
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:37:08
Maybe center it around a happy hour setting?  Thanks for the tip.....  I'm still digesting this tipping technology.  I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning as the possibilities are endless.  This feature alone should help bring in new users.....
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:29:23
I will and no, it's not a scam.  I will rpovide all the details and donations will go directly to the organization with Tax ID and tax write off.  I believe in karma, and anyone running scams on here is certain to end up with a bad life imho.  What comes around, goes around.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:33:11
I think every tiny amount has signifigance via the statement, but they also slowly create entire Bitcoins when the masses feed the cause.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:45:03
No, I have a good understanding of the risk/reward, but this tipping feature is totally new to me.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:27:56
Ok, I now will buy coffee via Bitcoin tomorrow and Monday morning. You guys rock and this feature reminds me of my first time sending and receiving an email.....
@_date: 2014-11-06 23:50:47
This is one of the MANY reasons I've been a huge Bitcoin fan for 1 year now.  I'm tired of the rigged system and all the skeletons burried beneath.  It's time for a financial revolution folks!  Spread the word and promote Bitcoin to everyone you know!
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:36:20
This feature along should push Bitcoin straight to 400!  I will scale the Alps and yell out to the world!
@_date: 2014-11-09 03:56:32
I will keep a tally on my outstanding loans and report the results for everyone to see......
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:06:06
There lies the rub as they document their borrows credit rating via, credit score, refernces, bank accts, credit card accts, social media reputation, address, official ID, etc.  The borrower is given a credit rating based on the above.  You can also see the borrows past history of loans if they've been using BTCJAM for a period of time.  I'm still exploring this platform and I'm trying to keep an open mind.  Your loan might not get repaid (just like a bank) and you don't have collateral to hold above the borrower.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:22:05
Heck, the dollar collapse could send Bitcoin to the sun!
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:17:18
Are we at a Tipping Point for Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:42:23
Every investment is a form of gambling, or taking a calculated risk.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:16:27
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:46:09
That might end up being the case with my experience as well, but I want to document so others can review what happens.  Did you spread out your loans to several borrows with high scores?
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:58:08
Keep accumulating as I've been doing the same thing by the way.  I would like to get up to 250, but that will probably only happen if price stays low for the next 12 months.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:19:20
Whoah....Up to 1.92!  This is really an amzing feature.  I can now donate small amounts to others be it for a good cause or a great statement or sharing piece?
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:46:15
LOL  They probably got well over 20k in commission from me over the past 6 years.  It literally makes zero sense/cents for them.  Oh well...........
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:14:49
Sorry dude, but I've been in the financial world since the mid 90s (BTC since 2013) and DCA is a beautiful way to invest.  In fact, the masses do it monthly with their 401ks.  It has worked for me countless times!
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:38:12
Yes, for the millionth time!  Sell me your BTC to end the pain.
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:17:48
Keep buying as much BTC as you can afford.  You are 110% right!
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:50:58
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:37:19
Coinbase sucks beyond words.  They will drop customers with ZERO explanation.
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:09:56
@_date: 2019-11-27 23:00:38
We won't be alive when that happens........
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:44:03
You always buy when it gives you that sick feeling in your stomach.  Your emotions will ALWAYS cause you pain when it comes to BTC.  Simply DCA every two weeks.........
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:57:51
So many missing the big picture as they hope and pray for a cheaper price.  Simply DCA on a very regular basis and think 18+ months vs. trying to make an impossible timed entry.
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:09:06
They've been wrong for over a decade now.  Old school waste of a rag.........
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:09:39
Thanks.  I did follow through with another ticket, however they said they wouldn't tell me why.  I've been with them since 2013 and I did nothing wrong.  I'm guessing they won't be around in a few years.  They owe me some kind of explanation........
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:50:35
Well done!  Add in the future if you can as I suspect BTC will traded north of 100k within 2-3 years.  I got into BTC in 2013, and completely cashed out about 18 months ago.  I just started scaling back in recently.  Good luck!
@_date: 2019-11-29 00:59:52
Square Cash App
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:26:06
Great post/video!  This is a solid reason we should all DCA over the coming 12-18 months.
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:04:20
So true!
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:50:05
Been involved with BTC since 2013.  The drop from 1.2k to 200 was WAY more painful, but I continued to buy and hold through that as well.  No worries......  Buy the dips!
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:11:46
Idiotic post of the day!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:33:29
I'm thinking the end of 2021, but we can only speculate.
@_date: 2019-12-19 19:53:51
Coinbase has done this countless times with ZERO explanation.  It will catch up to them soon enough.
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:47:43
Spread the word to anyone willing to listen.
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:25:44
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:39:23
I'm here for both reasons.  I absolutely LOVE the freedom that comes with Bitcoin and I can see the writing on the walls regarding worthless FIAT being printed by the second.  We have a finite supply with a decentralized platform and I hope continued appreciation.  It's a win all around.  I will continue to hold and dollar cost average for the coming years.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:13:31
I highly suspect the best is yet to come for you!  I will continue to DCA for the next 18 months.
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:40:49
Nice!  Well done  :o)

Ok, I've been using BTCJAM for about 4 months now. Yes, I've dealt with some scammers and/or defaulters, however I'm up about 10% thus far. People interested in the site should start small and learn via small amounts as a couple of my lessons were expensive. That said, I have profited thus far and it's been an interesting experience.
