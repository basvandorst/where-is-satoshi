I originally was interested and used some spare change probably a year and a half ago to buy some BTC. Actually bought in at 4k and sold at 16k. I saw the fundamental issues with crypto and got out before the hype died. I DONT EVEN LIKE CRYPTO AND IM DOING BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU SADCASES.

Crypto coins are stable in the same way as the Syrian government is stable. It has been shit since we can remember, shit now and will be shit forever.    
How on earth does fiat not satisfy this need.
