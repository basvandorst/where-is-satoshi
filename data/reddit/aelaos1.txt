high fees slow times. what's the question?
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:49:11
I imagine the day they add many alts..
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:19:55
why did you read that as a demand? I specifically say there needs to be a change of mind to all parties that think timing is not important.

@_date: 2018-01-23 19:53:35
everyday some company cancels their btc support today it was stripe. sad. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:59:09
not until true death
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:40:39
they did it in September.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:19:18
most of the altcoins have tech that scales without an internal war
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:18:39
it's called banking. centralization at its  best. do you even crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:20:14
will it make development faster?
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:49:52
stripe ending support etc
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:21:18
sorry to say but if Zuckeberg implemented something other than his own coin he would use something extremely scalable just as their services.. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:05:47
bitcoin dies a silly death now. wake up
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:38:50
Coinbase is the most trustworthy of exchanges we have got. There was something on December that bounced bank transactions. I know you are distressed I would be too but you are not going to lose your money. It will just take time. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:23:13
yes they can put 0.5% of the usa population in jail for investing, it's a good plan!
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:52:15
price went down as fees and block time went up. nothing genius
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:53:02
it's so funny that he acknowledges the inability of the bitcoin network to function as intended especially in moments like that. good luck sweating out guys
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:40:26
they did it in September. nobody was satisfied.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:59:57
this is what you respond to me, not to your non-teach savvy friend. just be honest and real about the situation. we all love the bitcoin dream

i suggest to delete this comment
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:18:53


can someone explain this? is it only for new anonymous accounts only?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:15:03
what people don't understand is that those who bought at premium prices bought from people that sold at terrible prices
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:29:39
guys, the article and most of the claims here link to exactly **one** tweet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:44
chances that was roger? ;P
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:47:30
it would help if fees were not scaring everybody out - I am talking about people that don't know/care about LN and other stuff
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:53:07
i wouldn't expect better than a gorilla bodybuilder honestly after your comments

I feel sorry for you. Price doesn't matter. Bcash doesn't matter. Bitcoin network is unusable. I wish greedy price idiots like you gtfo bitcoin once and for all.

electrum for this? or what?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:21:24
how is this related to a *non-working* network?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:03:22

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:30:04
and when you quit what will you tell them? now it's enough? :P

no, OP said he is a millionaire from his other activities since early 2000s. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:05:31
after 27BTC I think she should get something more from Andreas... :P
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:56:22
what kind of documents does coinbase ask? only for us citizens? apart from the normal verification i mean
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:17:15
from the aussies that i have met i think your analysis is very accurate ��
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:06:35
true but now im allin and no more money :)
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:30:40
fact: newcomers are stunned by the transaction costs. there is no argument past that.

like all remedies its only important before the patient dies
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:41:20
all my newbie friends are asking me "what is this really $30 fees to send you some money?"
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:28:40
what difference does it make if they would start trading on Jan 1 to you? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:04:52
to chase the dream and never work again
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:02:01
have you tried to send 1BTC and see fees/time? Be honest
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:00:36
lol I feel sorry that you try to be blind and pray
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:38
GEO does something similar no?
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:34:52
and when your friends freak out like "wtf does it really cost $30 to send you some btc" what do you reply to them? "temporary problem that will be fixed?"
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:05:24
nobody on reddit had this information. if you mean coinbase employees and roger's friends maybe. still, this shouldn't affect bitcoin more than if the same thing happened to litecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:25:20
and you would say that at this time it is not needed?
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:48:29

@_date: 2017-12-20 12:56:44
I do not disagree. But this is not a battle of bitcoin vs bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:07:34
if you need to do coordinated stuff to keep bitcoin afloat there is some kind of problem in the tech/theory
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:04
wonder approximately how much you need to retire at 31?

yes its tough. I made the same mistake but on a lesser scale. it was bugging me but fortunately I got into crypto again and made up some profits so i don't feel as bad. there is more in life than money for sure. deeply sorry for your loss
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:27:31

yea no idea why people think this is the only money of this whale :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:26
ok so some people got rich in an illegal way with an altcoin. what's in it for you? would it be the same if that was the thing for byteball?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:12:20
it is so retarded to bring the scaling battle into this thread. i feel sorry for you

it's not an attack. the tech is not there. monero or zcoin if you want privacy. sorry
@_date: 2018-09-03 07:43:42
yes if you see the charts from 2008
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:03
there are many threads about how sneaky coinbase is and in the comments people are talking lawsuits and government intervention. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:37:40

@_date: 2018-09-03 07:41:28
thether prints whenever market upticks and that's very frequently. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:10:04

why would they dump btc to buy fiat so that the feds catch them? that would be suicidal if indeed they are linked to silk road

enough with maximalism
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:24:04
it was enough to bring the market down due to panicky idiots
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:36:59
did you at least keep some?
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:04:33
in poker you can think someone thinks that you think that he thinks etc you get the point. the only solution to that is supposedly to think at level 0
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:44:55
huh? that's a perfectly valid syntax. are you even a native speaker? on drugs? this is getting out of hand. I won't respond anymore you have issues.
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:22:18
no it's not. ETF is not accepted yet, Jay-Z did not rap about Bitcoin and Trump didn't endorse it. Also Chinese government didn't start to hoard Bitcoin for the trade war hedge.

of that new system – some have argued for a Special
Drawing Right, a gold-backed SDR or similar . Otherwise,
a new USD crisis could overwhelm the financial system
without a coordinated response, risking a mass of
defaults, unprecedented exchange rate volatility and
a Balkanisation of the global financial system with
no single reserve asset and division of the world into
spheres of influence
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:28:19
because Bulgarian government is notorious for corruption along with all the balkans. and somehow they get themselves into 1billion dollars probably untraceable and you think they will announce it and split the profit with you? you are so naive?

@_date: 2019-03-16 17:49:00
don't do the Ostrich here. Altcoins exist and some of there have superior tech. Instead of whining push for LN to complete during the year otherwise game is lost. Encouraging delete coinbase and other crap is childish this is a free market one that Bitcoin promotes.
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:41:23
that's a clear failure and instead of fuck them mentality I suggest we reconsider the causes of this. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 11:06:10
difficult when the majority of this sub doesn't want to buy stuff with their BTC  It has been repeatedly discussed. This narrative says "Bitcoin will moon when people use it as currency but we don't do that". How ironic
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:28:35
this is superb! they fucked up the market totally
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:51:20
lots of similar stories but if people didn't spend them they would be worthless
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:40:41

@_date: 2018-06-14 08:51:27
so you are saying that he is speaking against his investments. you know what is bias? it is when you are presented with a good argument but your mind cannot process the information. just think about it for a while.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:03:40
and why u think coinbase stopped the service? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:14:28
radio technology does not have a limited supply, I find your argument rather odd. There can be no comparison with everyday products and monetary systems.
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:21:21
it is very simple what I am saying but you deliberately make it infinately more complex because your ego doesn't let you think clearly. Tether NEEDS TO INCREASE SUPPLY TO KEEP THE PEG THERE IS NO OTHER WAY AND ALL OTHER STABLE COINS NOW AND IN ETERNITY NEED TO DO THIS. TO PRINT MORE WHEN THERE IS DEMAND. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:54:48


we disagree. it cannot store of value if it's not used as a currency. if lazslo didn't buy that pizza we wouldn't be here discussing this, it would be a failed experiment. the value comes from people using it as currency. some egoistic players in the system think others are stupid for doing so. it's game theory. few people like you may benefit on the expense of the system but actually you are harming it. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:13:56
people like to insult others than focusing on the problem. what if I show you many transactions from many years ago? would that convince you that my argument is more right? are you that biased? 
have **YOU** ever sent a transaction with fees at $35 to go into the next block? Have YOU ever been asked by a friend while trying to convince them that Bitcoin is great "what the fuck are these fees, this is crazy system?"
Adoption requires scaling YESTERDAY WAKE UP.
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:51:37
you probably don't understand how cryptocurrency works and why governments and banks would like not to allow someone to peg the USD. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:59:47
I cannot explain something to someone that lacks logic skills plain and simple. Not everybody can understand arguments. As Satoshi said, I don't have enough time to convince you. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:40:06
the fees are extremely low when nobody is using it and extremely high when everyone is and the mempool gets stuck. i have used bitcoin multiple dozens of times more than you

insert reason for all merchants abandoning btc then please
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:45:46
tell that to exchanges like binance,poloniex,bittrex and all others that have served us well through the years and to all people that go into usdt when there is market turbulence
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:51:19
less volatile and less return. kind of obvious what's new here?
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:14:43
well since you say "against you" then we are not at the same side. which side are you and why are you in this sub? to bash on bitcoin? buy some berkshire hathaway and good luck!
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:51:42


I agree, but it's a scare story for noobs

check Blockmarket
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:26:35
from your nickname I can deduct you are a hater actually. I made most of my profits on Poloniex and they are a great exchange. so we disagree on loads of stuff
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:53:40
you don't understand that since it's the same for both of us this factor cancels out. actually, we don't have the same math background and i'm not being arrogant about it but you seem to think like "common sense" and i am telling you how things work in math/logic. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:30:52
you mean in LN? I don't understand how stupid you are its incomprehensible
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:15:04
yes the system is designed to print money when demand increases. it is STATED in their technical description which you have no idea about! the system benefits you and crypto in general
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:36:47
ok easier example. the notary can forge the document. on blockchain nothing can be forged and your signature cannot be replicated. I hope it's more clear. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:14:37
food for thought..I can't explain the whole technical system for you sorry :) DYOR
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:16:10
well I did and frequently buy shitcoins. so? it is a good bet.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:17:38


that's where we disagree though. that narrative came to existence only when fees skyrocketed and never before that. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:40:14
you can use bitcoin and syscoin there

@_date: 2018-06-28 16:11:20
sure i mean from customers. in btc the customer.pays fees so its the one getting screwed
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:19:46


huh? money in savings accounts depreciates due to inflation and interest rates are always lower than that. 


explain one situation when this is the case in developed countries please.
anyway you don't get my point. let's not have an endless discussion, I am saying this:
There *cannot* be logically any condition in which spending a currency for large amounts is ok but spending multiple times for small amounts isn't. There is nothing more to it. It's a law of math,economics,physics take what you want. 
Elementary example:
we both start with 5 bitcoins and 10k cash. I use 0.5 bitcoin for candy bars instead of cash. You use 3k from cash for candy bars. We both buy used cars.I buy it with cash and you buy it with Bitcoin. In the end, you are smart because you didn't spend bitcoin for candy bars but you used it for a car. I am dumb.I have more bitcoin than you in the end, buying the same things.
If you cannot see why this example proves you are wrong, there is nothing more to say really. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:12:47
hope now you get your head straight  son
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:49:26
this is completely crazy. take my example and work out why supply needs to increase/decrease and stop writing stuff because you can't accept that.
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:29:47
why did you join r/Bitcoin and not r/Blockchain? just to hate on it?
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:05:15
exchange rates are not 1:1 you are insane! really!
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:19:50
yes ok man, you got my point though
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:22:01
sure I will lock my BTC into an escrow in eternity so that after 100 years your dumb mind can conclude that it's impossible. Design the system and when it is ready we find an escrow. Also you will be world famous and giving lectures at financial institutions and probably be hired from the federal bank.
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:15:41
ok but you get your money if you will, it's not stealing. why would you not want to verify? (i understand privacy but then you go for monero and shapeshift style). shit happens, now they have to verify and pay taxes. poloniex was based in USA everybody knows you can't escape easily
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:33:16
im still offering you 10BTC to describe a system that pegs to USD without supply changes and anyone else. this is the ultimate solution. you can't -&gt; you are wrong. you can -&gt; you are right and I pay you publicly. oh and remember, it's not even a bet. once you design this system I give you money.

@_date: 2018-06-16 11:44:09
I do not have to describe thinks that are self-explanatory really. you should research and think how this system works or ask here or somewhere (not if it's a scam but how in theory works). or read this

You last argument breaks bones. Let's then artificially up the fees right? Nobody will be able to sell so there you go. Price going up and store of value right. Also you need to decide if high fees are good or not in your utopia because you seem to hold both positions in the fashion: now high fees are good, later we should make them lower.

there are other reasons for denial. first that some of the leading team are right out mentally unstable and second because the LN tech is coming for years now while fees prevented the world takeover that Bitcoin could have done in 2017 mania.

why trying hard to appear more intellectual? We are discussing a very easy matter. This is a p2p digital *cash* system according to its creator that has a problem. The problem is that on the path to adoption fees got so high that the system became unusable and we made steps back. 
So you don't want to admit that fees are a problem and you seem to like them. That's OK. Also you don't want to admit that the narrative of digital cash became digital gold on the way because/when fees got very high. It's OK too. 
I can't convince you. You may just as well say the world is flat and make up arguments and use sophisticated words. It's OK too.

you made an audit?


obviously because governments may get interested which is totally not what crypto world wants. it's very convenient to have usdt obviously.


you see the logical fallacy? you take your first argument as a true fact and continue to expand it. 
the version is quite simple and repeated by many crypto promiment people. just tell me one famous crypto person you admire that he is accusing tether . ONE.
tether have a system that is convenient to all exchanges and us to be able to get in and out of crypto as we please from exchanges that don't have fiat banks. they are not reporting the profits to ppl like you because they have absolutely no need to do it.
you need to understand that the price cannot keep it's peg if they don't have resources with this market turbulence but it always has. i mean you don't understand technical stuff because you cannot understand that the system collapses the moment they don't hold the reserves.

This can/will be done with signing smart contracts without people sending papers. Only one use case for this. Now think of SEC filings, government spending, medical records (with encryption) etc etc etc. This is not what Bitcoin is for. Bitcoin is Dollar or Gold as you like.

yes this is timing the market and it does not work according to economic theory but if you think you can do it because chinese youtubers teach how to, please by all means do it. everybody thinks economic theory is bs anyways. But your logic didn't understand my arguent. How can Draper be always a permabull while shorting? If he was shorting it would be *against* his interest to publicly announce bullish predictions. Same goes for Winklevoss and other big players. Small buys play the small game, big guys play the big game. Nobody became a crypto millionaire by shorting but all of them by holding. think about that for a moment.

But scams didn't make these guys rich. They are well known early bitcoiners and Bitfinex has a very big volume. These exchanges make millions by the day from trading fees.

@_date: 2018-06-15 14:28:16
there is zero reason to believe it is not. there is one reason to believe otherwise and it is that it's keeping the peg perfectly under any market conditions  for years. so it's basically no reason vs one (small if you want) reason. i'll take the latter obviously in a vacuum.
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:57:14
It's the other way around. There are extremely few articles/posts like mine defending the possibility that Tether is ok (I am not claiming that it is 100%) and extremely many articles published in premium media about the opposite. Media that are friends with banks and want Bitcoin to fail. They manipulate not only the prices but the newcomers here. That's what media does.

it's not because you cannot predict if a lottery number will win but you can predict with more than 50% accuracy let's say if a new technology is going to be used due to its innovation.

 &gt;If Tether sold USDT for $1, and promised to redeem it for $1 also, and people had faith in that promise, why would the price not float around the $1 mark as we have seen historically?
of course not because you need to account for new influx of money and the opposite since the price of any currency is tied to its supply. so when new money comes to Tether they "print" when money goes out they "burn" (they also did it you know). Anyway, I am not here to explain the basics to anyone, too little time for this. I can't believe we are having a discussion about why Tether is printing, I thought that was super obvious. So all this time you were thinking that everytime they print they are publicly saying in your face they are scamming you since printing is done on the omni protocol clear on the blockchain. Omg.  DYOR
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:11:45

no because in your scenario it's not common to ask for this. when you trade on a regulated USA exchange you know perfectly what you are getting into. at least you should. it's like telling your government "hey, you upped the taxes this year so you are stealing my money, we did not have a deal for 20% but for 15%". but it's silly to think like that. it's a personal opinion though.

probably not the likes of us that really like to use it as currency. well guess what, I signed up for currency back then. Nobody was talking about high fees thtat are good. But you already know that. You just write a lot of stuff to cover something very obvious, as a fellow programmer I thought you would be more logical in this way:
If you need to chose between two systems that do the same thing, do you want high fees or low fees? -&gt; low fees
are there other systems that offer the same promise of digital currency with lower fees right now? -&gt; yes
should we/they try to fix this problem before making Bitcoin do everything that a man has imagined could be possible in the realm of IT due to priorization? -&gt; yes
it's very simple.

disillusioned and irrational, quite childish response. I suggest you read some bias psychology, not that it would help much because it's a cyclical problem where the subject doesn't understand it applies to him.
anyway yes, I wanna be childish too. High fees are an encouraging signal obviously. Fees went down because people liked it so much they stopped using it and we had the opposite of adoption since merchants dropped it as an unsustainable payment option. **Satoshi really wanted that**.

They are 6 + one promiment bitcoin tweet. but regardless , let's say we are in a vacuum. there is zero proof they don't have the reserves but how the system works it cannot keep a perfect peg if they don't have the reserves during market turbulence.

Now if you want to debate if they are scammers go ahead. But not that  you can create a system that pegs to USD without supply increase/decrease. Actually I have personally offered 10BTC in another thread in this sub for anyone that writes a whitepaper pegging any fixed X to any Y that as a variable supply.

Not the same promise? Yes it's the same promise of decentralized fast low fee transactions. Changing the promise along the way for gold and store of value doesn't cut it.

there was never a problem with buying a car with fiat money. if bitcoin offers something it is true for small and big payments. there is no "threshold" that makes it good or bad. What you are saying is that a transaction of 10 is stupid but for 10000 it's smart. can you tell me if 5467 is smart or stupid? this is only in your mind.
@_date: 2018-06-17 09:54:14
what kind of calculation dude? You don't understand how Lightening Network works and my time is very expensive to convince you. But yes, the bet is on if you are so sure that I am not a developer and especially for 20 years. Oh, I am also willing to bet that I crunch numbers in my head faster. For a fee too. You have two bets now you can chicken out of. Both 1 BTC live. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:48:58


if you receive the transaction faster for any reason (nobody cares about blocks outside of geek world) then it is speed. If you wanna call it pasta call it like that.
 &gt;5) This is another painfully-misunderstood element; people who haven't been thinking about this stuff deeply tend to assume "high fees, uh oh, that's bad" when, if they'd spend some more time thinking about it, they'd realize that they have it exactly backwards.
 &gt;6) In any case, minimizing individual transaction costs over long term time horizons is important
you seem to be confused. Are you really a developer? You say that they have it backwards that means that high fees are good because that is the backwards of high fees are bad. Then next point says that minimizing fees is important. So basically 1!=1. I can't reason with you sorry. Unless long time horizons is the keyword in which something is good now but bad along the way.
The market has spoken. Bitcoin is accepted in much less places than it used to be. You and your friends are responsible for this and no typing can undo it. The rest of the points are either personal attacks or not valid (for example I never said Bitcoin doesn't have smart contracts but favored Solidity) etc.
When nobody is left using Bitcoin because either LN is super complicated and flawed or comes out in 2025 and fees are high every time the system gets popular (it FAILED it's first public appearance) then you can have conferences about what it was meant to be.

Coinbase is a major player and has the most user accounts and could cause the biggest disruption if they named the B2X chain "BTC" after only 48H. When they cancelled this and made it 2 weeks so miners can't mine at a loss for such a long time they effectively rendered the 2x experiment dead.

I could sign a transaction from an old wallet for the right amount of bet since I am a fan of truth discovery through money incentives :) How would 0.1 BTC with escrow as a bet sound? 
On your points for sure we have a lot of different opinions. First of all most of my post if you missed it is questions rather than statements. It is true and I wonder about *your* involvement in the space or which kind of bubble you lived in last year but I was trying as I have been since 2011 to motivate people to use/learn about Bitcoin. In multiple instances people tried to buy/send/use Bitcoin to find out that fees could sometimes exceed $30 in December that made them not only laugh but deem it as a stupid failure of a system. The fact that is a market cycle is something that nobody knows. There are market cycles but there are also events that affect these cycles. WWII hyperinflations were not due to market cycles obviously. Last year there was a catastrophic war and potential disastrous fork happening in November. It's dumb not to understand the importance of the events that happened.
There is a silver lining between decentralization and compromises to actually make the system popular which is needed unless we want Bitcoin to be used by some rich dudes because if its not used by the masses the rich dudes will just go back to Gold. 
My 2 cents. The bet stands since you seem quite sure about it. I accept any reputable escrow and a higher bet if you would like (depending on escrow I could go quite high into this ).

I do respect his technical abilities but I really think that Bitcoin is political and a huge social experiment too and dogmatic guys like him should better be replaced by developers with equal skill and a more open mind. Given that yes I kind of invalidate the title of my post and I know about it but I am only human and couldn't help myself. Sorry

When I said for me it's because that is what I understood from the many years of involvement in the community. You have other pillars.

I tend to disagree with your opinion about 2017. Yes altcoins were launched and people were removed but to the outside world it's still Afganhistan with local warlords having a civil war and that never helps. It doesn't matter if one warlord killed another one. It's still a shithole to the outsiders. According to Luke it's not his technical skills I am calling looney but all the other things that he has said in the past. Also I don't think you find a blockchain decrease rational either so let's leave it at that.
Talking about LN, it's not me. I write in the OP that I believe that the LN team has asked for it but it is a question and not a statement.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:20:37


this is interestingly circular. Have you thought that the amount of people that are using Bitcoin today would be much greater if there was a solution ready? That means that "we" are trying to developer a solution for the people that are currently using what is seen as a not-yet-ready system. You see the catch 22?

Thank you for the clear explanation of things and I get your point for the phone wallets.

@_date: 2019-04-08 12:48:58
interesting perspective you have. For me Bitcoin is based on 3 pillars: stable supply, no cencorship and no trust.
Having VISA scaling makes sense but you effectively remove the last 2 pillars making the value proposition only that it's a global store of value without any government having control for it. It may be the case but I am not sure we have truly discovered what the real value proposition is.
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:58:31
I am guilty it's true. It's not a technical opinion, it's my personal bias towards this person. From any perspective it's not even technical and everyone knows that implementing a block size decrease while a) everyone agrees that in the future we would need to make some small increases and b) a hard fork with a decrease would be probably even more contentious than the last one then you can deduct that c) it's a looney proposal at least.

Not enabling the software to scale is in itself a decision to the direction it takes and there were many fools from the other side very vocal about it.

I don't entirely disagree although Bitcoin had the purpose of competing with payment providers from the beggining and somewhere this narrative was lost due to (let's not go into that). 
I don't get why buying stuff with bitcoin means that you are selling this for fiat though. Even if Bitcoin is the only currency and means of value in the world still you have to trade it for food and services. Fiat is nowhere in this equation.

it's not politics. its super bad for the users to buy bitcoin and end up with another coin while they have no idea. it will destroy the adoption completely.

@_date: 2019-01-13 14:11:25
where were you last year around December? Can you explain why it happened if your statement is correct? I lost most of my friends when they saw that I can't send them some Bitcoin in a reasonable time and reasonable price. Anything else is a distortion of reality since those fees did happen. It's in a theorhetical sphere that damages bitcoin.

how does it explain they are out? what's your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:51:56
core bans people that want to split from its network. btc1 masks as core nodes. can you understand the difference here? one guy says I don't want you in my house and the other guy masks as his son to infiltrate the house. this has many names such as espinage, war tactics, burglary, faking, counterfeiting, trojan horse you pick what you like.

1) so do you think in G20 they will discuss about Bitcoin and not cryptocurrencies in general?  
2) do you think this doesn't affect bitcoin so we shouldn't discuss it here?

i would never give a donation to someone that has hundreds of  multiple times the money i am donating period. if he takes the money i am donating i lose any respect for him too. noone takes money for saving someone's life without needing it or he donates it to poor african teenagers. stop shilling and get your head together. you can lose an argument it's ok.

yes a second, it's not too late to see that 1) there is already big blocks implementation 2) there is segwit implementation 3) it's suicidal to have civil war on the brink of mainstream adoption. But I guess all extinct projects/species followed this path. I hope they will change their mind again.

so you can only bet your btc back after november happens so if you make a transaction then your btc is locked. is this correct?

I am rumbling about it everywhere and get called names. One guy suggested tue ctfc will take me down as I belong to the scam.Massive blind biad and hysteria.

@_date: 2017-10-05 16:15:29
again, why would someone invite people in his house disguised that want to overthrow him? I really don't get it. It's insane actually to think that btc1 nodes should be welcome in the bitcoin network.

can be the case, I don't know details. I just find it very difficult that these guys do not have a stack and be so idiotic. In any case Jeff certainly got millions from Jihan to lead this development, I am pretty sure for that. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:31:23
yes, but as all things in life you lose profit by reducing risk. this is obvious I hope
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:28:05
why is it silly though?
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:47:03
I am supportive. The only thing that I am skeptical is that everyone is interested in bitcoins best future. Miners and players that have already made millions may not be rational players and making more money is less interesting than ego or being "king of bitcoin" or having political power even with bitcoin at very low prices. They can also manipulate prices so much that the let bitcoin fall and cancel then s2x just 2 days before they bought a ton of cheap bitcoin. Things are not so clear cut.

who is neutral exactly here? coinbase? bitmain? its absurd that you want some exchanges signing nya and the others being neutral. think about it for a sec. and ofc b2x can be valued at zero if fork doesn't happen. btc1 is not forking from the network, b2x maybe is. that's absurd what you are saying.

spending alts is the same as spending bitcoin. why would you spend DGB if it keeps doing 10x increases? then you don't spend any coins. then cryptocurrency as a whole is not cryptocurrency it's a bubble.

@_date: 2018-07-21 12:59:12
futures need renewals and active management, rollover fees etc. with a bitcoin ETF the majority of fund managers can just acquire it through the brokers they already use (unlike signing up for third parties like coinbase etc that maybe they don't trust) and don't have to physically hold keys etc. This will create buy pressure.
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:49:11

that's very detailed and you know more about the subject than me. I was under the impression that RSK will *always* be compatible with Ethereum which to me is a dead end. But if as you say they diverge then yes it's a valid smart contract platform (like many other usurpers) with added advantage of Bitcoin stability.
Do you think they will make another language down the road or stick with solidity?

I have been here since 2011 but you know the saying "problem with the world is that stupid are cock sure and smart full of doubt"? anyway it was not the first time bitcoin did that and yes for this highly volatile speculative assets it can be normal. oh you wanna compare it to a stock i see.

are you talking about the scenario where all the miners will mine at a loss for a month?
@_date: 2018-07-07 09:04:35
well it was not designed to be non fungible so that means changing the whole protocol. that means miner/developer wars again etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:08:18
yes I agree with your thinking. Maybe here at 70%  loss is a nice timing?

basically you don't believe in bitcoin. you think the price was propped up by tether printing and not because your grandmother knows about it now and samsung is making asic for your fridge. 
once again they do not need to produce a report. actually they make money now by buying back tethers in less than a dollar due to panic sellers. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:01:43
actually that was the previous ETF filing and the current one is physically settled.
