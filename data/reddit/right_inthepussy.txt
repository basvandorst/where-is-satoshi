Go figure

it's already an accepted theory that mining is in the process of centralization and at this price hobby/hold miners are already shutting off.


Sure but do you accept that as margins decrease miners are forced to sell more to cover cost?
Can you see how this can have a compounding effect over time, 
i.e as price drops 10% we now need to sell 20% more coin to cover costs?
The whole point of mining is people will do it until there is no profit in it meaning until costs such as electricity reach the value of 1BTC more will mine. 
In the long term it's just a huge cost

Miners will dump even a larger % of their coins as centralization and cost to mine increases.
Becuase costs of mining are higher this will mean no miner can hold coins.
Positive feedback *can* continue until there is only one profitable bitcoin mining operation in China costing us all (25) x (6) x (24) x (Current value of bitcoin $410) to stave off inflation = $1,440,000 needed in new investment daily to maintain the current price.
If that doesn't come the price will drop according to supply/demand

Two questions, 
Why do you think (or do you think) bitcoin is worth $300 if it only costs you $170 to mine it?
Isn't the point of mining for it to become a zero sum game in the end.
also since it's only logical mining will become more centralized over time don't you see further downward pressure on price from big mining houses who are only interested in profit and well sell the coins right away.
edit: one other thing, these sort of things are scams right? 
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:48:36
I found a guide here for bitfinex one of the major ones.
If you want to join i have a referral code to get you 10% off fees.
It's quite simple you don't need to send them your ID or anything
@_date: 2014-09-25 09:58:12
yes but that created incentive to want more and more "luck" and to maximize your luck potential. 
A fair bitcoin system would be one where you have no incentive to increase your power and there is a true one node processing transactions means one equal share at finding the block. 
Either that or all rewards are equally dispersed to all nodes on the network giving incentive to actually use LESS power to get your hash on which will encourage more distribution,
Seriously when I can think of better mining methods in minutes it is a serious weak point in bitcoin right now.
When satochi originally made bitcoin it was intended to just make use of peoples spare cpu power, all this mining rig stuff came later

in fact I'll go so far as to say when the majority of posts are bearish then there is enough people waiting to buy
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:12:54
nothing wrong with shorting in theory.
if anything it allows a market to be more stable as people who feel negative about the price can express this on the markets. 
On bitfinex to short you must physically borrow bitcoin from other people who lend them to you at interest.

Have you looked at the 30K bitcoin wall holding the price down on stamp recently.
I watched it be place and the price drop $15 in seconds out of fear
@_date: 2014-10-09 12:49:45
**For anyone who wants to see the latest figure for shorts check out : 
I'm very busy being glued to the screen myself but basically on the top right of the graph there you see the red line which peaks at 12,500, that is the amount of bitcoins sold short on Bitfinex.
Selling short basically means you borrow bitcoin from the marketplace to sell now hoping to buy them back when the price drops lower.
*IF* the price doesn't drop lower you still have to buy back those bitcoins which you owe to the guy who lent you them.
Right now it looks to me like people keep shorting more and more expecting the price to go down again but are loosing their bet.
At some point they can't hodl any longer and will need to buy back or face losing all the collateral they put down in exchange for the loan.
Would you add anything to that ELI5? I think I covered it Ok
Edit: At request of here is an update to the short situation, there are currently 13,200 bitcoin sold short or "owed" and need to be bought back so appears they are still adding to their short positions!! 
Although you can't really tell 100% as this the figures show the total number meaning that bear A who went short at $330 may have close his bitcoin 100BTC short just now but Bear B just opened one at the current price for 100Btc.
There is only so much the data can tell us but It's my personal opinion that it's still too high.
The only thing bulls can be happy about today is they are losing money hand over foot right now.

yea essentially they can't send money to an exchange so would be willing to use credit cards to buy people stuff on amazon at a premium to get a hold of BTC that way.

@_date: 2014-12-17 07:19:47
So now mining really is a 1million per day expense 
@_date: 2014-12-17 07:23:31
Not really, 
If you look at the economics of mining the fact the hashrate is no longer rising pretty much means (with the current generation) mining equipment it's no longer profitable to add new mining power.
This means miners are just about break even on the cost of their operations and because the main cost is equipment,electricity and cooling they must now sell the majority of the 3600 BTC mined every day to cover these costs whereas before this they may have been able to hold some of the coins for speculation purposes, now it's a cash business

Well it was a few months ago on bitcointalk and I just got met with the usual wave of evangelists saying I'm only thinking about one negative use case and the reason people are willing to pay a premium for bitcoins this way is people in third world country's don't have access to BTC but have access to credit cards instead.

Ok I'll bite.
I'd imagine 90% of people will say the best site to use is bitfinex for liquidity, ease of use, security etc.
SO Just sign up for a trader account there.
here is my affiliate link if you don't mind me pimping which will get you 10% off fees for a month and small kickback for me as well.
Then on the signup page you can enter "zY20KlZr1P" as ref code or just follow this link: 
Then pick usual username/password stuff and the only slightly confusing thing is you want to pick "trader account" as the Account Type
After that you go to the deposit section and move funds to your deposit address listed there.
after 3 confirmations bitcoin is in you account and you can trade.
You don't need to send them documents or anything unless you plan on withdrawing USD.
As regards trading I think it's self explanatory but I'm happy to explain more if you need it.
See how you get on with that first anyway 
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:29:54

yep, tha'ts exactly why I can't get bullish on the bitcoin price again until there is some sort of black swan event for bitcoin that acts as a real motivator to learn.

Then by your logic the money supply has been contracting for months as people paying interest on long positions feel the pain.

Why is ignoring people who "short bitcoin" such a popular opinion here.
There is the opposite argument that if more people would just short it six months ago it would have found it's true market value much faster after the obvious bubble it experienced and bitcoin could now be in a rebound phase rather than a slow downward decent. 
Inflation via mining will make sure it reaches its true value sooner or later so why even promote trying to fight it?
I'm short bitcoin right now AND I'm a bitcoin proponent, There is no argument to rationalize why one bitcoin should be worth more than it is today unless you want to suggest all miners are operating at a loss just for the lulz

This is the problem I keep telling people, to make bitcoin useable and safe the average person really does need to spend a 5/6 hours minimum just to learn the risks and mostly just be aware things I'm sure a lot of people here take for granted.
That's too much of a commitment for people who just want to pay for a coffee with their smartphone.

Pretty much that but slightly more serious than with gold


* Gold miners are not responsible for securing gold backed security's and gold reserves worldwide
* Gold miners cannot hold the gold market hostage (it doesn't strictly *need* them to function) without the big bitcoin mining companies hashrate will drop off a cliff transactions take hours and bitcoin seizes to function. 
In short gold miners don't have much leverage over the gold market, bitcoin miners do and should centralization continue it makes sense for them to collude and perhaps even demand changes to the protocol....or else
Does that seem like a genuine concern? 
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:27:31


Yes, it is not what I call user friendly so it's a "flaw"  You need to a certain level of understanding of encryption and internet security to use it safely, This is problem but one that can be addressed hence why I point it out as a problem right now which will hinder future adoption.
You can spend all the time learning how to secure your wallet and then lose it all to one attack vector you didn't think of.

The Trezor is indeed very good.
I try my best to remain objective to the problems facing bitcoin while being a supporter of the technology but I feel there is so much security problems remaining that they will simply scare people away from bitocin until they are solved.
Bitcoin is essentially digital data that is very valuable, there is no way to say in 1 year it's wont be more profitable for hackers to sell zero day exploits that could be used to steal wallets or otherwise compromise bitcoin, point being there is a minefield of problems that will show up if and when it gets more popular.
the problem of pseudo anonymous data being valuable is every blackhats wet dream when it comes to theft. 
Yes the guy who had his bitcoin stolen on public wi-fi was stupid but so is accepting terms and conditions to I-tunes and all the other magnitude of ways people compromise their security every day in order to just make their day a bit easier.

True but do you honestly think sybil is a bigger problem than the current centralization problem? I think if anything the burdensome task of maintaining many machines (while still not a good) at least invites more decentralization due to increased labor involved, for example every node would need a new IP/MAC setup

If I believe that chart last years bubble was just the "take off" and this year was the real one.
I'm taking it all with a grain of salt but IMO mining centralization is killing bitcoin right now.
Instead of having a network we own, some companies mine all coins at a cost of 700 million per year to holders in inflation at current prices.
There is just not enough new money to absorb that cost

I don't expect a bitcoiner to understand market forces and why you wait for a proper reversal to buy in a bear market but keep shilling the "cheap coins" line because us bears LOVE resistance to dump into.

@_date: 2014-10-09 13:45:41


To borrow coins you must put up collateral for them.
On bitfinex the maximum is 1 :33  so for every bitcoin I have I may borrow 3.33.
If the price moves so far that I am no longer able to buy those coins back the coins I short/long will be automatically sold/bought by the exchange and returned to their owner and I lose ALL my collateral
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:24:55


it's quite simple, when just a handful of miners own the hashrate they can simply choose to shut it off and because difficulty takes o long to adjust the network is rendered useless.
decreasing margins in mining means less will survive, it's only logical big companies will retain larger share and thus "take control"

I'm with you 100% on that, but where are the plans to integrate it into bitcoin?

That's why I say things probably need to change because I see nothing but  continued centralization from the current system to the point where maybe only one chip maker exists.


You don't have to prove it, either they return the required work on time or they don't. those who don't need to tweak their pc's or turn them off because they are are not fast enough to process all bitcoin transactions 
Efficiency is obtained by the operator to achieve maximum profit in the same way I can overclock my PC to keep up with the newest games but in doing so reduces my efficiency.

I'm pretty sure whoever bought those coins at $300 is having second thoughts now
@_date: 2014-09-25 10:13:10
What if the system divided up the new block among ALL the miners who did enough work, Please hear me out, I'm sure this would require a big remix of bitcoin and might not be possible because of 51% consensus required but.....
What if mining was restructured so to encourage miners to use the lowest necessary power to confirm all transactions in a block within a reasonable time frame, as the network starts having more transactions per minute my miner is no longer able to confirm all the transactions in the last block before the time limit (say 5 -6 minutes) so no longer get included in the distribution/lottery of coins found in that block, 
This will encourage distribution of the network and also will best reward machines with are efficient rather than powerful since those who scale miners to match the power required to confirm all transactions in the block get rewarded.
I'm sure there are potential kinks there but in principle it sounds better and more green than bitcoin currently

I'm aware there is actually more mined each year but I'm trying to keep it relatively simple but appreciate the critique none the less.
It's also true there is many coins which we include in the market cap of bitcoin which were lost/destroyed/other and so out of 11 plus million it's possible only half will ever be useable making inflation even more of a factor.
I wish someone would come up with a market cap for bitcoin which only includes coins which moved after being mined.

I have no problem with it apart from the fact it weakens bitcoin security the more centralized it gets.
Some people here have been trying to argue with me saying bitcoin's nature is to become more *decentralized* 
Followed to it's natural conclusion you end up with maybe less than 100 people owning 99% of the entire network and when you control the network you control the development since forks can't happen without your approval.

I think if we have to choose between a future which is decentralized and one which is not I know which one will have a positive impact on price and which will have a negative.
When the network is centralized to the point control over it rests in the hands of a dozen or so people we literally have the exact same thing as today's central bank system where miners control bitcoin rather than the other way around and the threat of them holding the network hostage suddenly becomes real.

Oh I am worried about those things, espically the less than useless bitcoin foundation that needs to out PR apple pay some day if bitcoin is truly to get mass adoption.
I also feel we are getting ready for a whole lot more mining scams to come to light as some shady companies have their lights turned off and cloud hashing is exposed for the scam it is. 
I mean it really says something about bitcoin when open ponzi schemes like [this]( operate in broad daylight.

While charlie knows his stuff on bitcoin I think he is making it sound ponzi like now by saying well other people will simply pay more than market price.

They are not going to learn it just so they can feel secure about using bitcoin in future and more people like that will may now wander into bitcoin and think it's cool will get all their money stolen the same way. 
It's just a massive PR disaster that bitcoin will simply let happen because the foundation is useless and the current users prefer to victim blame those who are ignorant about security because doing otherwise it the same as admitting bitcoin has faults.

Miners will dump even a larger % of their coins as centralization and cost to mine increases.
Becuase costs of mining are higher this will mean no miner can hold coins.
Positive feedback *can* continue until there is only one profitable bitcoin mining operation in China costing us all (25) x (6) x (24) x (Current value of bitcoin $410) to stave off inflation = $1,440,000 needed in new investment daily to maintain the current price.
If that doesn't come the price will drop according to supply/demand

@_date: 2014-09-25 12:11:56


Yea I'm aware of what it can and can't do but could be very good at breaking passwords. 


but not conducive to decentralization since at the end of the day it will always be more profitable for one person to mine over another until you eventually have power stations using excess generation to mine BTC.
I'm not saying that's likely but I'm sure you see where I am going.
In the end as you say "We understand the algorithm and it has no further optimizations" so logically speaking the nature of bitcoin is to become centralized over time. 
Won't this rub against the core appeal of bitcoin at some point?


We got a good story out of it though, huh?
There might be better ways but because things are the way the are it sure wont be easy to get the current generation of miners to agree.
It sure is interesting times for bitcoin but until change happens that addresses my concerns I've moved for an early adopter to a currently short skeptic I'm afraid :(

So terrorism is protecting their own citizens from their crappy currency that is flat-lining as we speak.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:40:05


Because there really is no adequate way to secure a bitcoin wallet and still have it useable without being quite well versed in security.
Even early adopters are still loosing coins to hackers: 
Anyway I can only say as a UX/Useability designer people will go the path of least resistance and to be very honest the amount of *basic* security features you and I most likely take for granted are not even on the radar for the average person. 
To safely store bitcoin requires a day or so of learning for average new user.

yes and I applaud bitfinex for implementing this new algo which helps space out the margin call more rather than dropping the price to perhaps zero by not controlling the cascade.

Yes and more efficient ASICS  come off production lines every day filling the old retired capacity. 
That said I do believe rising costs and the now commercial nature of mining will mean even more strain on the price due to industrial miners margins getting tighter and increased electricity and other costs removing any opportunity they once had to hold excessive profits in BTC.
Of course the smart miners would have already shorting the futures markets all year to lock in profits,

If you trace the time on the graph you can see most these positions were opened around $340 and are really starting to feel the pain now (especially if they are leveraged short)
Edit Bullwhale lives, Look at this wall at $375:

Not really it's more a case of survival. 
3600 (or there about) bitcoin will continue to be mined daily, the only thing that changes is who gets them and what they are worth on the open market. 
Miners will continue to sell until there is only profit left for the most efficient, 
I don't know why that is so hard to understand around here. If anything the convergence of mining cost and market price mean miners soon wont have any option to hold bitcoin as they need to pay most of their increasing costs in FIAT

I don't predict returns but like I've been doing for myself use best available information to navigate a path through crazy market dynamics that are bitcoin. 
The trend is down as it has been for the past year so until that changes which would mean a rise over $400 it's safe to assume it will continue. 
If I had 10btc now I'd sell 6 and keep 4 accumulating 1 BTC again for every $10 price drop.
If I was mining and have projected 10 BTC income from mining over the next two months I would short sell all ten today and simply take my profits. 
I'm a trader and locking in profits is always better than taking a risk on a the price going up or down, There was a $12 difference between huobi and bitfinex after the crash this morning, I could have made more money  if I just bought everything at the lows but then I run risk of losing if it goes lower, instead knowing how they would average out even again over time I simply sold the two BTC I held on Bitfinex and bought two on Huobi for $12 less, the price has now narrowed to a $5 gap so already I locked in $11 profit with next to zero risk. 
The same goes for mining, if you are mining coins at a cost of $120 today(assuming hardware is sunk cost/paid for) why not take the $190 price that's available on the futures market today and lock in your profits since who knows what will happen the price. Of course being a miner you know people are making them for less so there will always be downward pressure on the price from other miners selling.

Just what bitcoin needs, another pyramid scheme 


*Cringe* I can tell you have been working on it for 15 years as you are S.T...A.L.E
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:42:33
Well if you are mining coins now for &lt; $150 and believe that convergence between cost to mine and market price will continue unless significant new demand is found then I would be shorting the futures markets so you can "lock in" today's prices in one/two months time. 
In fact right now quarterly futures contracts deliverable in 72 days are trading above market price right now indicating market participants still think bitcoin will rise between now and then.
it's hard to say whats best for you without knowing your own unique situation and how you hold your profits but if I was a miner right now I would be anticipating industrial miners continuing to drive down the price and hedging against that by selling on the futures market to offset future losses due to negative price pressure.
That way you essentially can sell some of bitcoin you mine in 72 days time at todays prices, if the price drops your short position gains but the coins you mined will sell for less and if the price rises your short position loses out but your coins are worth more. 
There are many intricacies but that's my 2 cents to responsible industrial miners who may anticipate where the market is going.

And you are replying to somebody talking about *home/industrial* mining costs.
You sound bitter but don't let that step in the way of understanding simple logic about mining. 
3600 (or there about) bitcoin will continue to be mined daily, the only thing that changes is who gets them and what they are worth on the open market.
Miners will continue to sell until there is only profit left for the most efficient,
I don't know why that is so hard to understand around here. If anything the convergence of mining cost and market price mean miners soon wont have any option to hold bitcoin as they need to pay most of their increasing costs in FIAT.
$100 - $150 is about the cost/true market value of BTC right now
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:18:18
So what you are saying is cost to mine one bitcoin is way below market price right now.
So in other words the current market price is overvalued
