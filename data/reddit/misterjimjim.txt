I've seen it drop many times since 2013. It doesn't affect me anymore lol.

I'm a long time hodler and I want to use it as currency. In the state that it is in, it cannot be used as so. I'm still hodling because I'm hoping for the devs to fix the problems that Bitcoin Core currently has. Yes it will probably have to fork, but that is not a problem for me.
Currently, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum can do everything that Bitcoin Core has trouble doing. I'm hoping the devs find a solution to make Bitcoin Core usable, or I hope that alt coins can take the place of Bitcoin.
I don't care which coin survives, as long as one does. Widespread adoption will hopefully reduce volatility and stabilize the market. One day I would like to use it as currency, but that will take some time. All I can do is HODL and hope that one of the ones I own makes it.

Not a problem. I just felt like "what do you want me to say? congrats?" didn't seem so friendly and didn't help progress the discussion that much. I understand that it is hard to keep a level head when discussing something you are passionate about, but not everyone is here to attack one another. I also am not here to attack anybody and just want to have a civil discussion. I personally own BTC, BCH, BTG, ETH, and LTC. I want crypto in general to do well so I don't have an agenda against any of them.
I know that BCH does less transaction because it isn't as popular as BTC, but my point was that we haven't seen it perform at the same rate as BTC yet. I've been into crypto for almost 5 years now, but I am still learning something every single day. I just want to know a few things about BCH. If all the transactions from BTC were brought over to BCH, wouldn't it reach capacity or get near it? If there was wider adoption of crypto in general and people started using BCH more, will the 8MB block size hold, or will another change have to happen to make the network viable again?

I had a ~$6k transaction the other day that only cost ~$2 in fees and took a few hours because I wanted to save money.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:58:58
You seem very standoffish towards me for no reason. I just saw that you said current fees were $20, but a transaction that I had processed only cost me 2 bucks and took about 8 hours. The fees are just what you set it to. What is the size of your transaction and what did you set your fees to?
I'm not disagreeing that there are better alternatives out there right now. I personally like Ethereum more than Bitcoin. It is processing twice as many transactions as Bitcoin, but with a much lower transaction fee. Something like a gas limit would be great for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has to change someway to make it viable in the future. It needs to be faster with lower transaction fees. It needs a permanent fix and not just a temporary one like upping the block size. Bitcoin Cash is currently cheap and fast, but they're also processing only 1/15th the amount of transactions Bitcoin is. They had to increase the block size 8 folds to get it to the state it is in. It's probably not seeing as many transactions because of the increase in block size. There are a lot of people around the world with not so great internet that stay away from larger block sizes.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:59:42
But then you can't say you get paid in Bitcoin.
Also, here you go \
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:15:02
Visa processes 150 million transaction a day. The block size would probably have to be &gt;300MB to match that. That would increase the blockchain size like crazy. There has to be a better solution than just increasing the block size. I don't believe any crypto has that down yet.

The military.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:47:41
It is really hard to read and understand what you are trying to say... Kills and deaths both count because a kill is also a death. The United States military is number 1 because of their training, advance weaponry, military assets, and capabilities. You mentioned the army, but you have to look at the military as a whole, not just one branch. Besides the military budget you've mentioned earlier, you have provided no proof or sources to back up your claims, only speculation. This debate cannot proceed anymore when only one side provides evidence. This concludes my argument.
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:48:04
Um, the US has the top ranking military in the world and it is not based on size alone. There are over 50 factors that determine it. If the only factor was size, China would be number 1 because they have more military personnel than the United States. We also have the most nukes and that isn't even taken into consideration when ranking military power.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:06:37
Check the links I provided lol... Both sources show the US as the top military in the world because of more resources, weapons, planes, etc. I never said the army is better. I said the military is.

I bought 25 litecoins in 2013 at $4 each when bitcoin was rising. I also bought some bitcoin at the time for $250 each. Keep hodling and watch it go up. There will be crashes, but it'll always come back higher than ever.

@_date: 2017-11-10 19:33:01
The government? Which government exactly? Bitcoin is used all over the world, not by a single country. No single country has control over Bitcoin. China has banned Bitcoin multiple times and it still keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:21:35
Been in Bitcoin for over 4 years. I've seen many bubbles pop and yet it still rises. I'm not selling. I'm not going to trade it for cash later. I'm waiting for mass adoption so I can use it like I do regular currency.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:12:22
Yeah, I don't understand the hate between the two factions. I want both sides to succeed. It just means more money for me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:59:47
I have both and we don't know what will really happen. Only time will tell. I've been hodling for over 4 years. Not selling anything anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:19:58
It's alright because some of us have a few million elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:30
Been holding since 2013. I bought when it was $250. I saw it go up to $1200 and then drop like crazy and stayed that way for years. I didn't sell though and that paid off. I'm probably going to hodl bitcoin and my other crytos forever. Hopefully, I can pay for things directly with my cryptos in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:25:48
You'll be fine. Just hodl and it'll always recover and go up even more. I bought at $412 and have been hodling for 4 years. Just don't invest money that you're not willing to lose for the next few years.

Because the trees often go to the tree stylist when their branches get too long. Trees take pretty good care of themselves.

You're not going to find a savings account with over 2% interest to offset inflation. Especially if you have a lower sum of money. The best right now is around 1%. You'd have to go for other types of accounts to get above that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:39:54
60% drop from $20k. I've seen it drop over 80% before.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:45:10
Yeah, you basically lose money due to inflation unless you invest it into something that gives over 2% interest. Keeping large sums of cash is not a good idea because it ends up losing value every year. It's good to have some of your money liquid in case of emergencies, but not your long term savings.
Putting your emergency fund into a money market account is great and then invest the rest into something really safe to balance out the inflation.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:41:46
Well, it's better than losing cash due to inflation?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:10:21
It may be volatile now, but that doesn't mean that it'll stay that way.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:00:38
Yeah, I don't think it'll drop below $4000. My guess is $7000 will be the lowest it'll go if this is indeed a correction. Who knows for sure though.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:43:45
Both options will work. With coinbase, you won't have access to both coins right away, but you will after a few days.
If you pull them off of coinbase now, make sure you move the coins on both chains to new wallets after the fork. Make sure you move the legacy coins first and send a small amount to the address mentioned earlier in the same transaction to enable replay protection.
It's better in my opinion to not keep your coins on an exchange in case they get hacked. If you don't have the keys, then you don't really control the coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:49:58
I've seen it go down 80% and then go up 8000%. Bitcoin is a crazy ride.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:21:49
Updated my earlier post with more info!
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:13:41
How do you decide? If you have Bitcoin in paper wallets, what do you have to do?
Edit: I just read up on it and it looks like if your coins are on coinbase, you'll have access to both currencies after a few days. If you have it on a paper wallet, then you have to transfer the coins on both chains to new wallets to prevent a replay attack. This makes it possible to own both coins after the fork. Is this correct, or am I missing something?
Edit: Okay so I've read up on it some more and apparently you can have coins on both blockchains. After the split, you want to move your legacy coins to a new wallet, but also send a small amount to 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi in one transaction. After that, you can move your 2x coins on the new blockchain to a new wallet. Sending the small amount to that address opts you into replay protection so that people can't take your 2x coins and vice-versa. That is the current way to protect yourself and have coins on both chains. Things may change if they decide to change up segwit2x before the 494784 block gets mined around mid November. It looks like if I have my coins on a paper wallet, I actually don't have to do anything until I decide I want to move the coins. If I want to move/spend the coins, then I just have to move them to new wallets first with a small amount going to the earlier mentioned address.
