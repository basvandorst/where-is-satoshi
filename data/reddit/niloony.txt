If anything it's too low. That would hardly cover even a tiny fraction of the galaxy's supply.

Given the dollar placement and language I would say the country in which they reside has a lower minimum wage.
That or they're fishing for a donation.

The assumption is transactions of that size are avoiding tax, dealing in criminal goods/services or the cash is sourced illegally. There isn't that much scary in the idea in isolation.

Well OP left a phone number on it. Might as well call him to find out.

Lots on google.  Following is a good starting point.
Your big issues may be legal compliance and how you would go about cash collection and delivery.

Currently the potential limit on transactions is the ability to move transactions from the blockchain to the lightning side chain. This will still be limited to about 200 million transactions per year.
Say people do 2 transactions per year moving bitcoins to the lightning chain the number of people using bitcoin to do transactions is limited to say 100 million.

That is about $3,100 USD.

There is an old share market saying - "Don't try catching a falling knife".
Only buy when the price has stabilized for a couple of weeks.

Just not possible.  That would mean a 500 times increase in value. 
It would give bitcoin a bitcoin market cap close to the total world GDP and far greater than all the world's currencies.
Say 20 million bitcoins then in circulation and if they were each worth $2.85 million (500*$5700) per bitcoin we get a market cap of around 56 trillion dollars.  Over twice total US debt.

If a third party goes rogue, or uncooperative,  the channel is automatically closed and the coins return to the main blockchain.

It should be available again after 14 days as the original transaction will disappear off the network.

You need to do an on-chain transaction to open the channel (and another one to close).  So people will need to do on chain transactions to move bitcoin to lightning if they wish to control their own bitcoins.

You would be able to pay Alice via Bob. 
Also Bitcoin can remain on Lightning.  But to set up your initial lightning balance you need a transaction to the bitcoin blockchain.  How often people load or unload their lightning balance, or how often channels close,  will not be known until lightning is running.
