interesting point. I didn't realize the precision could be increased as supply diminished. Like the article, I also (perhaps mistakenly) thought it was fixed.

hard drives crash all the time. 
people have poor backup practices all the time.
i think there are plenty of ways this happens unintentionally.

i believe the article is suggesting a possible solution--not that bitcoins work this way today. 
I do see what you are saying (that private keys will be crackable in the future and can be used to retrieve lost coins) and that makes sense too. the main issue is that you need a way to recover the coins. I think this works. But is this how the system is supposed to work?
edit: regarding the .000000001 BTC scenario. my understanding was that it was not infinitely divisible--there is an upper bound in the precision of bitcoins. is that incorrect?

It would be great if you could elaborate. I'm not sure what fallacies you are talking about.

Your intelligence shines through in your answer.
I'd love to understand how you think the issue of inaccessible bitcoins due to wallet destruction is not an issue.

Hey Ben, I'd suggest creating an online interface so that someone who doesn't know how to code (or use git) can help translate. (sort of like facebook did back in the day). Otherwise you're restricting things to a very small world of people who are programmers, multilingual, and are willing to volunteer.

why is the tone of this article so condescending and vitriolic?

good one. I was going to post this as well. its intuitive to think that money originated from barter but archeological evidence shows that it did not. taxation was the origin for a system of money.

however, if there are very few bitcoins left and there isn't enough to do any sort of commerce, then it is no longer valuable as a medium of exchange.
