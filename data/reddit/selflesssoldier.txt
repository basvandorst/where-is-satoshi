Is that to facilitate moving the blockchain data to another machine if necessary? Or is it just to prevent over-taxing the primary drive on a machine?

Disappointing that posting to r/bitcoin seeking latest/best strategies for running full node gets scrapped by mods as flagged for removal. Considering that increasing network nodes ought to be a top priority, routinely dismissing anybody actively seeking to expand bitcoin network strength is a bad sign. Especially considering the competition from altcoins.
The FAQ/Newcomer list does a poor job encouraging anyone to setup a node. Pointing to a single 2014 article about setting up a node under a paragraph about mining doesn't do much.
Now I know that r/bitcoin is only suited for latest hubbub and gossip, I'll continue to rely on other sources for useful information.

That was precisely the intention, unfortunately I am still early in the process of seeking help to acquire the best information prior to having anything to contribute. But my attempt to solicit for that help was cut off after only a few baby steps. Making matters worse, the automated removal response mistakenly indicated I should seek help from this FAQ page.
Over policing of guarded online communities is no great surprise, I simply did not expect to encounter that same old tendency from a community focusing on supporting decentralized technology. I am not inclined to participate in communities which require proof of work simply to engage at all. Fortunately a few users were generous to offer some advice before the thread was scrapped. They were able to successfully interpret an opportunity to offer help where others can only see danger, harm, suspicion, insult, amateurishness, and other unwelcome sentiments.
