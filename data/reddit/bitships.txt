You don't get called if bitcoin is going up.  Now if they were that leveraged where 8-10 drop forced their account then that is just crazy on their part.  Just people in the know taking money.  You can't know where this will go up or down.  Time to sit on the side to see if this is a trend reversal IMO.

Holy cow! Willy Wonka, a guy that other bloggers quote backed up the the investment analysis!  How could we not all be mortgaging our futures to get some more bitcoin!  Just read what they said -
Willy Woo, a bitcoin and investment blogger who is often quoted in cryptocurrency articles, tweeted his estimate of the bitcoin price if an ETF is approved. He noted markets speculate $500 million to $1 billion will be injected if approval probability is 25 percent. Assuming a fundamental $900 bitcoin price, he estimated the price at $3,231 if $2 billion is invested in the ETF, driving bitcoin’s market capitalization from $14.6 billion to $52.4 billion.

When bitcoin is almost entirely centralized it loses what value it had as the early adopter.  Bitcoin mining farms a race to the bottom and putting themselves out of business.

I would say stay away from Gdax.  They have got better but have had a lot of downtime.  Even today when you needed it most orders went pending and froze your funds up.  When seconds count it is unacceptable to be locked out and can't even cancel or enter new orders for 3 minutes or more at a time.
Again, they have got better but with just a little volume today it froze once again.  If you are just looking to trade when there is no major volume gdax is fine.

You sound a little unsure of yourself.  770 down to current levels and by no means does it imply selling is over.  No Brexit, then further add in the misconception people have that the halving has not yet been priced in.  Sell the news.. I would still be selling had I not already mid 700's.  But again sounds like a person who got scared on the dip and never sold trying to convince themselves everything will be ok.  
It really takes a firm understanding of how bitcoin self corrects and how the miners work to understand the price of btc right now is completely exaggerated, miners never hold this much of a profit margin for very long in bitcoin world.
Good luck

I have not used them in a long time.  I do believe at one point they were based in Georgia or in the Ukraine.  They also had their cloud mining servers over there but since publicly stopped that part of the business I think?  Also at that time ( A while ago they were diversifying server locations ).   All in all not sure who knows who is behind them or where they are actually based.  But like others said they have been around for a long time now.  Also maybe they are more legit, transparent, and not based in parts of the world most people would associate with " more risk "  I can only speak to where they were a long time ago when they first started.

The problem was really the no warning thing.  I had mine handy and updated with no problem.  However, can you imagine if you needed access to those funds and all of a sudden you had no way?  Some people would need to go through a lot of hassle just to get to their own funds.  Again, yes I have a car, am educated, live in a nice city etc.. so even had I not had access to produce the document I could have within a few days ( Still was not right about no warning ).   BUT ONE MORE TIME, those who had no warning and needed their own money without the ability to produce what coinbase needed is the concern.

I basically sent the email you did to them before purchasing.   I did the math before and wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something because there was just no way to remotely break even.  ( Maybe if bitcoin jumped 1000% overnight and it took a few weeks for people to jump in ).  They emailed me back saying I didn't miss anything...
This was a few months ago...  Even Hashnest/Bitmain one of the best values you could see with the difficulty jumps that even their latest s7 wasn't going to come close to break even and that was a far better deal then Genesis.

It is not just bitcoin. Ethereum also greatly inflated.  Something is not right.
@_date: 2016-05-22 21:08:33
I love the bitcoin model and how it adjusts to all the factors I agree with you and understand how that part works.  My concern is the blocks right after the halving where expenses are going to be the same yet rewards are suddenly halved.  Those 2000 blocks right after is my concern.  Will be interesting to see.  
To be clear I understand every word you are saying and agree with your input.  I have been around bitcoin since it was 2.00. I have no worries with bitcoin if we clear those 2000 blocks somehow after the reward halving.  IMO it could be a major catalyst for sustained price appreciation of all crypto that is IF  enough of the hashrate is able to stay on to clear those blocks. 
@_date: 2016-05-22 21:41:48
Feel free to point out what parts are untrue, as a miner I would like to know.
I agree with you if the halving is a non event and for some reason mining continues at half rewards for 2000 blocks in the time it will take to achieve an equilibrium then I see no problems going forward beyond the normal block size discussions etc.
As you said as a miner I would be interested to know what your situation might be like ( it is different all over the world ).  For you your electric costs and the efficiency of your current equipment is enough for you to stay above water at half rewards?  
Mine is not, it would be different maybe if I was using the heat instead of combating it here soon.  Still I would be losing money and I would be forced to turn off equipment.

Thanks for the link it will be beneficial to some who would like more information.  
I have read his thoughts before.  I disagree with some and agree with others.  He has some knowledge of what he is talking about but ruins it with the " just as I predicted " wording.  
Still it is good for people to read as much as they can so you don't have armchair investors who know nothing about how the system works yelling FUD, SELL, BUY etc. 
Again, thanks for the link.

I think it is more about margins not price.  Right now anyone that mines knows margins are razor thin even for the most efficient miners.  Margins will need to increase close to 100% of the price of bitcoin before the halving or it could very easily be a disaster.  IMO that is not remotely likely and if it doesn't happen there are going to be 2000 blocks that will need to be mined before difficulty adjusts back down to where miners can turn their machines back on.  Who is going to want to lose that much money for that long?  Big farms especially could have losses of 10-100's of thousands a day if they tried to hash through until the next difficulty adjustment.
In that scenario even more people will pull hashing, could be a doomsday scenario for bitcoin.  Yes, we have heard bitcoin is dead so many times.  My question to anyone is what will prevent the scenario?
I would be hedging to fiat or some of the other top coins that would most likely drop if bitcoin fell apart but could also just as likely take over bitcoins top spot.  
Ethereum is one coin that IMO I could see take off even faster then it has as money starts to move before the halving.
Again, I would be happy to hear why anyone thinks that with the way the market is going, the reality of profit margins, and the way bitcoin adjusts every 2k blocks the scenario I laid out is not only possible but probable.

No need to carry on this conversation with you.  Those of us who do mine and are fully aware of costs all over the world will just disregard your useless input that has nothing to offer.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2016-05-22 22:37:52
Well said, I admit saying 90% was incorrect as I have no way to know.  I should have said a large percent imo.
I am aware there are miners who use free electric and that is a valid point as well.  I would contend that we have enough older equipment or equipment that would be under water to take a significant part of the hashing offline.  ( We will soon see )
Thank you for your well thought out discussion I appreciate it and I bet others will find value in your thoughts.
@_date: 2016-05-23 03:40:05
Blocks will not be found faster, quite the opposite until the next difficulty adjustment.  That is the time period where problems could happen.  After that next difficulty adjustment you are correct miners who are left will find more bitcoins for their hash.
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:55:36
I actually do have an idea how margins are for miners.  I am guessing by you eluding that margins are remotely big at the moment that you do not.
So you think 50 % of the current hashrate is mining at nice margins?  You think places that currently have efficient miners might have expenses, for example, of say 50k a day but revenues of over 100k that will allow them to achieve break even?  You might want to do some free calculations with the most ideal electric rates and efficient equipment.  I am not even certain the protype 16nm ( if there is sufficient private equipment out ) could support the whole network at current difficulty without a major disruption.
But thanks for the input.
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:56:09
I will give you that the network is still growing.  Which would not make sense if money in the know felt something would probably go bad.
@_date: 2016-05-23 02:00:52
It would take the remaining miners even longer to find blocks and compound their losses forcing more and more to shutter.  This could continue until the network adjusts difficulty back down.
But there are many opinions in this thread why people don't think that will happen.  Everyone needs to decide for themselves and at the very least understand why things are happening if they do start.
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:43:37
I thought of point 1 you made as a possible solution for the big miners if they don't want to severely damage their continuing business.  It is the only way in my mind they can really preempt the problem the 2000 blocks to readjust will cause.
@_date: 2016-05-23 03:37:31
The problem is it will take a cycle for the difficulty to adjust to be in line with the market.  
There is nothing telling any miner they must continue hashing at losses until the next difficulty adjustment.  That is the danger of a possible domino effect.
Still others think it will have no impact.
@_date: 2016-05-19 18:52:41
Not attacking you specifically.  Just wish people thought more about the difficulty change.  If you are barely making any money now mining, you will certainly turn off your machines when you are making half as much yet your costs are still the same.  
People have a mistaken idea that half the coin rewards ='s coin price doubling.  Actually it will quickly even back out to where margins are just slightly over costs of electric that is if some entities are willing to take massive losses for 11+ days to get to the new difficulty.  Not sure how that is going to happen.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:16:36
How about you give a reason the scenario is not likely to happen? Taking into account current margins and what would need to happen in relation to the halving to make what I wrote FUD?  
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:37:28
Possibly.  I am not sure how it is going to get done, but I agree bitcoin will probably get past the halving and eventually even out.
At what price and how much or how little damage gets done we will need to see.

you can also search your wallet address that you deposited into bitfinex.  See if there is a transaction to that address that matches your amount.
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:47:31
I also am wondering how many miners/big actors that are in it for the long run will have the ability to mine at huge losses before 2000 blocks are found to readjust the difficulty or btc price rises enough to cover the lower rewards  ( but continued same expenses ).
If the network doesn't break down in my scenario I laid out I could see a huge increase in btc price, but imo it will start after the halving ( if people see enough miners are willing to operate at losses. )  
@_date: 2016-05-22 21:14:25
You are 100% correct on your assertions. 
I am just having a hard time believing enough hashrate will be able to stay on for 11-22 days ( more as more hashrate gets taken off ).
If you liken it to say an airline who like bitcoin have 2 major expenses equipment and fuel ( electric ) I wonder what ones would continue to operate at huge daily losses if they knew they could just suspend operations for x days and then resume ( that is another concern I have ).  
I hope you are right though and thanks for the input.
@_date: 2016-07-12 07:12:05
Well, you have a tx id right?  Did they get sent from coinbase?  Does your transaction say pending?  If you have a tx id of them being sent and they are in the blockchain that would be on bitfinex end.
