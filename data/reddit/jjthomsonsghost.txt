the whole country isn't scammers? is that what you are saying?
I sell on paxful and most Nigerians are quite honest, new and confused.

PAXFUL.STORE is NOT paxful, another phishing site. beware

ever hear of ZamZam water?
The guy who runs it takes bitcoin and 100% of all the funds go to helping kids. They just built a school in Rwanda and wells and stuff.
Few other crypto peeps donated to them. 1 million would go a HUGE long way with them.

That site has NOTHING to do with Paxful! 
Watch out for phisers, the Paxful guys warn ppl on their forum and slack of each one but there are so many.

Just use paxful !
pretty simple. they work better and have 24/7 support and been around 3 years. and they actually do stuff like build schools in africa.

paxful does mostly gift cards and super small amounts. I always got alot more trades on Paxful but did more volume on LBC because I did in person and bank transfers, but noticing a huge surge in bank volume on Paxful so times are a changing, Paxful has a better ui and no in person. Seem to be doing alot of African conferences and charity so good for them.

yup they rock
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:15:05
Paxful is the next biggest p2p marketplace. Easiest to use and their support is 24/7
Also doing some cool stuff in Africa.
Just found this and donated a bit. 
Crypto needs ALOT more of this, giving back, rather than just shills, pump n dump trolls and slime.
Props to the pax guys for sticking to the ORIGINAL MISSION OF BITCOIN. anyone remember that?
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:39:42
yup weekend support too, 24/7 actually. lbc is 9-5
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:18:08
Paxful. they give back too
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:16:53
no deposit fees on paxful or local eth

I am in the vendor slack with the pax guys, real chill dudes and they help alot. not sure why this guy is always attacking their threads. competitor maybe? not lbc tho, they have too much class to be so low

that story was a big joke. they explained themselves pretty clearly in their blog post. the gun and hash they had was all legal. that is why all charges were dropped. read it here.
sounds like u got something personal against them?

best places to get bitcoin are Paxful.com and lbc imo.
MasterYang on Paxful is the MAN! deal with a few times and he will hook you up with big amts of bitcoin, instantly with no id! seriously look him up now!
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:41:11
otherway around. I do all my big shady deals on lbc.
I do all the small visa gift card deals on paxful with higher margins, just girls and gamblers paying for stuff. paxful is pretty innocent actually. margins been going down a but but it is still a great place to sell.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:48:27
paxful and lbc are the places to go.
For gift cards defiantly paxful. lbc has more western union etc..
