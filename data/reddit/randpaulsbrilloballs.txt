Do you want to use violence to starve people without enough money to food?
Do you want to force people to sell their life in the form of wage-labor on threat of forced starvation and homelessness?
Do you have any rebuttal for my "free to starve" argument?
Do you use violence in your personal relationships to protect your private property?

Nature's coercive.  All hierarchies are coercive.  They're ways of forcing people to do things that the boss wants them to do.  Government is just another hierarchy.  Don't want to work?  Then starve.  Don't want to pay taxes?  Then go to jail.
These are the rules of the grown up big-boy world.  Deal with it.

Ted Turner *already owns* state**s** worth of land.  Right now.  Today.
This isn't speculation.  This is empirical fact.
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:48:43
Let me make it clear:  You do believe that initiating force is the best way to handle relationships with other people.  You want to force them to sell their time (wage labor) in exchange for food that they're not allowed to grow themselves because you want to force all land to be exclusive private property.  Since many people are not born with land, that is, they do not inherit it, you are forcing them at a barrel of a gun to be wage laborers or else starve.
That is, **you** believe that initiating force is the best way to handle relationships with other people already.
You just don't like taxes.
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:08:53
Not a strawman.  You don't want to allow free common land that is unconvertable to private property to exist, correct?
You believe all land should be private property, right?
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:09:12
I just don't see the difference between forcing everyone to sell their wage labor or starve under a bridge and forcing everyone to pay taxes.
It's force any way you cut it.  
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:44:49
So it's force either way then.  The land he owns could support millions of people.  A farmer or rancher could build a nice homestead there and support his family.  Instead, now he must work for wages and obey Ted Turner's commands and earn only a fraction of the value of the crops and livestock he makes.
And somehow you think this is "self defense," but having all those workers vote on a property tax rate to recapture some of the value Ted Turner took from them by using force to prevent them from owning the land is "aggressive?"
Sounds like bullshit to me.
It's force either way.
@_date: 2014-12-30 07:09:17
Good.  Now you're getting it.  You don't have the right to ANYTHING either.
Not.  Even.  Property.
It's all force.
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:16:29
And what makes it "theirs?"  It's a deed, right?  A purchase, right?
Surely you're not saying that Ted Turner doesn't have a property right to the 2 million acres of land he purchased unless he can physically defend it all by himself, are you?
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:31:58
Oh yeah, Johnny Englishman "trades" the Native American a small pox blanket for Manhattan, so it's all legit self defense from there on out, right?
Come on.  You are forcing all of the commons to fall into expensive private ownership at the barrel of a gun then calling the exclusion of people from using the land "self defense."
I could just as well say that property taxes are "self defense" for the rest of us from letting Johnny Englishman and his kids exclude us from using the piece of land for eternity because the King granted him in 1750.

How should I know?  And who cares?  It probably happened before I was born.
Did I consent to let one man own states worth of land in my country and prevent the rest of us from using it?
I don't remember signing that social contract.
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:00:29
You want to force all land to be parceled off and sold as private property to the highest bidder in the market, no?
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:26:15
Ok.  So we've established you believe Ted Turner, on account of his massive wealth (and company inherited from his daddy), has the "right" to buy up land the size of Delaware + Rhode Island and tell everyone else they're not allowed to use it or step foot on it or else they'll be thrown in a cage or attacked with force.
Even though over a million people live in Rhode Island, and his land is 2.5 times bigger than Rhode Island, nobody may live on or make use of the land he bought, because it is private property, and they are forced to obey private property laws at the barrel of a gun or be killed or arrested.

I don't think it is.  
Anarchy might be the natural order of a universe without force.
I just don't think we live in that universe.

I didn't consent to give one man two states worth of land before I was born.
You're going back and saying, "Look, this guy bought the land by consent at some point."
And sure.  Probably.  But people voted and consented to be part of the United States of America when the Constitution was first ratified too.  In fact, that Constitution was their social contract.
And yet now you're born into it hundreds of years later.  You never consented to the social contract.  
Just like I never consented to being banned from accessing millions of acres of unused land because a guy has a contract - a deed - and there are social conventions that grant him rights because of it.  I never agreed to that social contract either.
I'm forced to respect his property power claim.
You're forced to respect government's power claim.
Ted Turner doesn't care what I have to say.  Just like government doesn't care what you have to say.
It doesn't matter if the people that first set the system in motion all consented.  We were born into the system and we didn't necessarily consent.  Or at least that's the point I thought you were making before.

Welcome to the free market.  Good luck bootstrapping a new job after being fired and losing the reference!
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:22:04
Hey, you're the one who wants to force everyone to obey and respect private property at the barrel of a gun.
It's force either way.

You ask me, any man who is born and inherits a multi-million dollar company (even if he is as adept at growing it as Ted Turner was), then uses that to buy up entire states worth of land, kind of has "right to rule" status himself.  Government has a monopoly on the right to authorize legal violence, yes.  But where there are entire counties majority-owned by a single man, who does the County Sheriff really report to?  What's he really doing out there?  Want to defend your right to homestead some unused land on the 2 million acre turner ranch?  Who do you think is going to stop you and why?
There's only one way to defend yourself from government.  Just like there's only one way to defend yourself from being forced to work for someone else if you were born without property rights to enough capital or land to support yourself.  You leave.  You quit.  You try to live free somewhere else.
But that's way easier said than done.  And it's really expensive.  So it's not really an option.  And if you try to live free of government or try to homestead an acre out of a rich man's unused millions, you will be punished severely if and when you are caught.  So we're all sort of forced to work within the system we were born into.  There's not really another choice.

I'd hate to break it to you, but I don't think such a chain exists today.  Almost all land outside of Europe was taken by colonizers by force and trickery.

Respecting people and forcing people to respect property claims are two different things.
Property is force.  It's domination.  It's control.  By definition.  You said it yourself.
Nobody consulted me about whether I wanted to be born into a world where all the property was claimed and deeded out and owned before I was born.
Just like nobody consulted you about whether you wanted to be born into a world where there were governments everywhere and all of them tax their citizens since before you were born.
But, since we don't have the right to ANYTHING, I have to deal with private property, and you have to deal with government.
We have to grow up and live in the big boy world.
Don't want to obey property claims?  Then get shot or go to jail.
Don't want to pay taxes?  Then get shot or go to jail.
It's just the way it is.  Force on all sides.
@_date: 2014-12-31 09:40:57
Good.  Now why does one man own the exclusive rights to land the size of Delaware plus Rhode Island and then some again?  I just don't understand how you can defend his rights and simultaneously say we all were born consensually into a system of property rights where we have to agree that he gets to own states and we get to own nothing.
Either we have NO rights by birth, or he has NO rights by birth. Force me to accept his rights, and it is violent force at the barrell of a gun, crueler than taxes.  And just as violent.
