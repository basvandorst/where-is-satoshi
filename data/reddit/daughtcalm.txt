Still, we are not talking about home users being big players here. Certainly just like with web hosting and cloud services the economies of scale will lead to high-density solutions in a datacenter rack when commodity hardware can be used. Why would a desktop machine remain competitive?

"The binaries from the play store decompile just fine, you can verify this for yourself." Download source, diff against the decompilation. Of course you would need to be able to tell the difference between malicious insertions/deletions and discrepancies caused by decompiler quirks. I'm not an expert in this area, perhaps it is not so simple or practical.
