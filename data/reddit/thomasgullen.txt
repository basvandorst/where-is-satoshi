Do you understand it?  The laws around trading when insolvent in most territories are extremely strict, and can open owners up to criminal prosecution if you continue to operate when insolvent.  Why do you think they wouldn't need to file for bankruptcy if they are insolvent?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:41:05


Insolvency doesn't mean 100% of your funds have to be gone




No evidence of that
Insolvency means they are unable to pay their debts.  People who deposited cash or Bitcoin on Bitfinex are creditors.  If everyone wanted to draw their Bitcoin/cash tomorrow, Bitfinex clearly wouldn't be make good of all the debts, ergo they are insolvent.
This is unless a white knight comes along and bails them out (they'd probably have to be insane but I guess it could happen)

Was a big time Bitcoin supporter at the start years ago, but basically all the big hopes for it haven't materialized and I don't see how they will.  Personally I feel it's condemned now to further fade into obscurity.  I feel to get moon prices one of those big hopes needed to of happened.

You might get less, you might get more.  It depends on how honest Bitfinex have been.
Currently Bitfinex are in a terrible position.  I would at least consider trusting a bankruptcy process to serve creditors interests might be more beneficial than the insolvent company.
But, we will never know as only one of two will happen.

Your assumption is that 36% loss is representative of the actual loss.  And you're assuming that the directors have no liability to pay into losses themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:56:27
Look up the definition of insolvent.  "Unable to pay debts".
I suppose if they force everyone to accept a loss, they are no longer insolvent.  I would be surprised if that was ok to do in the eyes of the law though.
If Bitifnex was incorporated in the UK you can force the company to wind up if they owe you money and don't pay up.  I wonder if HK has similar things.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:48:30
Oh,  so you're talking about the 36% being paid back?  GL with that.  You have a lot of faith in their management.
Don't forget, for them to get that 36% back they'll need to soak up 36% of everyone's balances in fees, plus operating costs over that period.
The counter argument to that is they will attract new business and growth going forwards - not something I'd bet on.  As soon as withdrawls are enabled vast majority of users are going to withdraw everything.  Hugely reduced trading activity puts them at serious risk of being unprofitable for a long period of time.  Not somewhere I'd want to keep any balance.  Nor is it any longer going to be an attractive target for investment.  The Bitfinex brand is tarnished.
The water is starting to swirl down the toilet.


This is why I rarely post in actually has much more civil and level headed discussion.

This is lucrative for the dev firm who've been contracted, (who bizarrely appear to have a minimal web presence).  Forums are insanely complicated.  There will be endless bugs, glitches and other issues.  They will be paid for maintenance for a very long time, and it will be a lock in because so much money has been spent on it already they can't abandon it.
There is no value here whatsoever, it's a huge waste of money and resources.  Much better to hire to write mods for current forum software, and make it look prettier or whatever.

Is the `address` the Bitcoin address?  If so, using it as a PK is probably ill advised.  I think it's much better to have an auto incrementing int as a PK.
A little concerned about SQL injection possibilities (of future possibilities) looking through the code.  This is why I think PHP is probably not a good choice for Bitcoin projects, it natively doesn't allow you to paramatise SQL queries.
Also the naming conventions are a bit sporadic, eg in common.php:
 * usats_to_satoshis()
 * handleSuccess()
Also what do you mean by `Impossible to corrupt`?

Not short term enough for something as volatile as Bitcoin.  Could be looking at say for example 300% increase in that time.


I'm not sure that makes sense.  Are you saying shorter term loans have less exposure to volatility, well because they are shorter term?  You seem to be suggesting the short term loans *usually* have less volatility risk?


Greed has no bounds!  Don't mistake this for genuine market demand and need!  Loaning Bitcoins is a horrible idea.
Browsing your listings, looks just as horrible at BTC Jam.  People mixing personal/business loans, starting up ridiculous business ideas.  Quite a few desperate people who apparently can't borrow any other way as they are apparently willing to pay high APR's for small amounts of money.  Your website boasts 365% APR on the homepage.  This is into predatory loan territory in my opinion.


There are other options.  Taking out a loan at 365% APR for a new business probably ranks pretty low on the list of good first business moves.
Currently your site offers a great free roll opportunity.  Take out a short term loan, sell the BTC for cash.  3 months later, if the price of Bitcoin has dropped, pay it back and start over.  You've made a bit of money.  If it's gone up a lot, default.
Everything's probably ticking by OK as Bitcoin is trending downwards, it has been for a while.  Now you've picked up some momentum, and once Bitcoin does go up suddenly and significantly, and stays up, you and your lenders/borrowers are going to be in a completely different game.  Good luck.
And hell will freeze over before I [donate money to a financial lending companies marketing drive](  How audacious!

If I buy $300, and $60 insurance, is only $60 in the bank account or $300 to cover the rebuy?  If only $60 and you plan to sell the Bitcoin to cover the rest, if you gain any traction you'll be looking at slippage for additional loses.  I don't think it will work or can scale.
It's also complicated, can I sit on my Bitcoin until the price is $50 or do I have to excercise the claim as soon as it's under $300?

I spent a little time taking a look at Moolah, and I wasn't filled with confidence at all.  To me it looks like a total amateurish operation, they are trying hard to put up a professional front but unfortunately it's quite transparent and they don't come of looking well from it (talk of international offices, the aggressive video etc).  Would of been served much better if they just presented themselves as a UK based startup not as a multi national business with offices opening all over the world.
They are making the classic mistake of trying to build a swiss army knife company when building a single quality product and delivering is enough work in itself and probably has a higher chance of success. 
Before they'd even got very far they found themselves bogged down with minority investors who were taking up a lot of their time.  The equity they are selling also is entirely trust based, you have no shareholder rights at all.  From what I could gather as well, they attracted a lot of dumb money, people willing to invest without actually seeing any balance sheets.
The idea of selling equity then almost instantly issuing dividends for a company where I can't see any way they could be profitable yet is pretty suspect.  Website is wholly incomplete and underwhelming.  I can't see any obvious route they are generating revenue yet, enough to justify dividends.
I wonder how much they pay their employees as well, if they are actually employees.
Moolah can probably address each of these points one by one and come up with some semi convincing arguments, but the bigger picture is there's a ton of question marks, questionable decisions and practises.  Not a good investment opportunity by any means.  Doesn't bode well going into the future.

Anyway getting back on point, they are obviously problems.  The difference is how we think they should be solved.  You think let the free market solve it, I think the government should work towards solving it.
Current implementations of government regulation are not ideal and have lots of shortfalls such as with the financial crisis (I agree more people need to go to jail for that), there's a lot of room for improvement.
Leaving it to the free market totally would also have a lot of shortfalls as we'd be relentlessly exploited by corporations running cartels and generally running amok, there's a big history of this.

I don't think this is fair, and I don't think you actually think this.  It would be better to argue it's not fit for intended purpose.  And I can't see the million dollar reason why modding normal forum software wouldn't be fit for purpose.
It is open source apparently (which is nice), and it is funded in part by donated funds which means imo the donator has surrendered their right to any input on the funds unless there was a promise of what they would be spent on, so his money to do as he wishes.
Just think it's a tremendous waste of money, and a gigantic and unnecessary risk with a huge lock in factor with a web firm that is charging premium prices.

Gambling websites cause huge amounts of misery, and contribute virtually nothing positive in the world at all.  They are uncreative, and contribute nothing to the bitcoin economy.
Don't underestimate the amount of despair and suffering some people will endure from using these sorts of sites.  You can argue that everyone is free to do as they want of course, and I guess they are (debatable with addicition), but the majority of profits will come from these sorts of addicts.
At least regulated gambling entities have some safeguards in place for people like this.  Those safeguards stopped me a couple of times in my past.
To me it feels like there's an extra level of cruelty to bitcoin betting.  Lose $1000 you've lost $1000.  Lose 10 btc, if btc skyrockets or appreciates greatly your going to probably suffer more.

Also, let's assume month one profit is £1k.  You pay out £150 (15%).  Month two is a loss of £5k.  Payout zero.  Month 3 £1k profit.  Do you still pay out £150?

As much as I like seeing technical innovation in Bitcoin I think releasing a tool such as this is:
 * Bad for the Bitcoin cause (yes I know people have differing opinions on what the cause is exactly, mine doesn't include the free and open trade of weapons)
 * Unethical
 * Likely to be developed/released irresponsibly with very little thought to the consequences or ethics of it
The creators of this tool have links to what looks to me like an extremist group who wish to make the manufacture of weapons free and easy for everyone in the world.  Even if I beleive the line of "trade isn't a crime" (which I consider incredibly naive) I have to question if the distribution of weaponry around the world is part of the motivation behind it.

To argue that restrictions imposed on capitalism by the state is a large reason for the corruption and sometimes irreversible harm we see in the world today is a stretch at best.

Bitcoinjam is like the absolute worst idea ever.  Why anyone would lend there is beyond me.
Here's one reason, you lend someone 10 BTC to fund their car, holiday or whatever dumb reason.  What do you think happens when Bitcoin doubles in value over the period of the loan?  They will default.  It's a double whammy of bad luck for lenders, they don't get paid back AND they lose out on Bitcoin doubling in value.
There's so many other reasons as well.  Bitcoin is already a risky enough investment in itself, why do people continually feel the need to 'lend' or 'invest' it in the pursuit of higher gains?  You just can't justify it, especially at the moment when there's an epidemic of scammers and scams.

Risk probably plays a large part in it as well yes.  I think all it takes is for a mining company to decide "actually lets hold 10% of our machines to run ourselves" to screw over a lot of customers.
Pre orders are a pretty horrible way to sell them imo.  If the price of Bitcoin rises, greed could grip the manufacturers and they hold some of their stock back.

Oh dear, doesn't sound like a good start.  If you're running a business, why wouldn't you incorporate?  That'd be a red flag from me if I was evaluating your account.
You also have links to PotCoin on your homepage, a crypto currency from what I can tell is specifically for marijuana.  Not particularly a smart move when applying for a bank account to support your business?
Also, look at Candadian laws around this sort of business.  There may be additional requirements.
Either way, good luck.  Had a similar problem here in the UK when I applied for business bank account for a crypto related business, even with a lot of cash backing me and a good financial relationship with the bank with my other business.  They just don't want to do it.

Interesting idea, not considered that.  Thank you for taking the time to explain it to me.  So if I understand correctly, as someone looking to buy I would list people I trust, and then relative to that I would know who is most trustworthy to buy from.  2 degrees of separation for example probably OK, 10 degrees probably weigh a lot less.
The problem I see with this (if I've understood it correctly) is as a new user to the system who doesn't trust/know anyone, how can I avoid being scammed?  And wont this basically stunt wider adoption?

The model makes no sense, especially since you have absolutely no way of measuring if people are actually wearing it or not.

Your other post you said you're not taking CC's, which leads me to believe your comparison to Circle is a little unfair because their whole business model evolves around taking instant payments via card.  What payment methods are you planning on accepting?

Don't forget this is all from the people, or people with very close relationships with Cody Wilson, the guy who released the first 3d printed gun into the world under the organisation [Defence Distributed](  An organisation with the aim of "facilitating global access to, and the collaborative production of, information and knowledge related to the 3D printing of arms".  Wonderful.
That to me is quite scary and I'd rather not support or validate anyone in that area.  The way they "Defence Distributed" approached the problem was in my opinion grossly irresponsible, and I'm sure a lot of their future projects are probably going to follow the same irresponsibility and lack of care of consequence.  Exactly what the Bitcoin economy needs less of.

The fees are a little more than that, and I think JackBond1234 was talking about Forex speads as well.  If you're depositing on Bitstamp for example:
Depositing £1,000:
£25 international wire transfer = $42
0.1% deposit fee (min $15 USD) = $1,681 - $15 = $1,666
And in that GBP -&gt; USD conversion there is a spread which also will cost you, from my deposits it looks in the region of 1%
Forex fee = $1,666 * 0.01 = $16.66 = $1,649
Then for a buy BTC order we're looking at a ~0.5% fee: $1,649 * 0.005 = $8.25 = $1,641
Total fees to get Bitcoin from £1,025 are (assume we pay the int wire transfer fee on top) = $42 + $15 + $16.66 + $8.25 = $81.90 = £49
This comes out to nearly 5% of the starting amount.  If Bitstamp ran GBP trades, and had a UK bank account then you've wiped out 80% of the fees! (Int deposit and forex).  Until that happens, it's going to be fairly expensive for most people, and it doesn't quite make economical sense to buy BTC for daily spending/payments etc yet.  OP's fees are ~6%, and unfortunately Paypal beat BTC in time savings and ease (at the moment!)

It all sounds super sketchy.  Especially paying dividends out so quickly after raising funds, at the same time as looking for new funds.  Makes no sense.  
Also do you have a copy of the balance sheets/revenue statements anything like that when you made the initial investment decision?

That's a nice way to frame it, but is misleading.  Silk Roads utility was basically entirely for drug trafficking.  Just because it had a books category doesn't change this.  Even if we naively assume that wasn't it's intended purpose at launch, once it starts being used almost exclusively for that purpose we can reasonably assume that is now the purpose of the site.  It's highly convenient to argue that the site is a 'harmless meeting place provided in good faith' at the same time as banking millions in profits from a very well defined and narrow subset of activity.  Libertarianism increasingly comes off to me as politics of convenience.
Good luck to you though, I do admire people that actually act on their convictions peacefully and take action regardless of if I agree with it or not.

Bad poll imo, two options should be:
"Should we stay or switch to another pool"
Splitting the votes into 3 options could mean if 49% of voters would vote Ghash, you might get 31%/29% split on the other two options so Ghash wins, when all the other voters would probably have voted move pool with a 2 option vote.
Unless that is of course Petamine considers option1 vs option2+option3 votes, hope it's that way!

Pretty sure a concerted effort by one or more powerful governments can suppress Bitcoin effectively.  If they just attack legitimate businesses that accept Bitcoin (ie make it illegal) then that's going to be it for the foreseeable future.
Difference between Bitcoin and Hollywood is that Bitcoin poses a far bigger threat to established power.  There would be a lot more motivation to try and kill it if they went down that route.
If it was illegal for legitimate business to accept Bitcoin, it kinda would stop in it's tracks right there.

If average order size is $20, and we assume 30c +2% card fees, that's $30 + $40 = $70 per day in saved card fees = $25,500 per year.
Not sure what sort of fees they take to go btc to fiat (actual savings to business) but that's significant revenue loss for card processors.

Depends on the hack and how they are stored.
Having multiple wallets and private keys could create multiple attack vectors, as well as increase the chance you will make a mistake and lose them.  It's not necessarily more secure, it increases the complexities significantly.

I think this is false.  You can have a lot of cash and no identifiable opportunities to use it elsewhere.  If you have a lot of cash in the bank, moving it for a short while is no big deal.  I find a lot of people seem to think if you have a lot of money it's easy to make money, it's just not true.
If I had ~$500k-$1m in cash I'd be tempted to just have a punt on the off chance I get some coins.  And that wouldn't make me an idiot for 'pointlessly and wastefully tying up capital that can be used or leveraged elsewhere'.

I don't think what you're offering is a franchise.
Also, from my perspective it doesn't look like a good deal at all, you're basically just creating a website directory of Bitcoin friendly places, and charging a 1% fee for anyone that wants a listing and then calling it a franchise.
Or have I misunderstood?  What else can a franchisee expect?  To call it a franchise you need to offer a more, and probably have more to start.  From [Investopedia](




Your plan doesn't really fit into that definition in any way.  From what I can see it's a paid directory with a near zero traffic website.

With Bitcoin mining equipment you just plug it in and go.
There are basically no other considerations.  As soon as you plug it into the wall it's making you money.  Couple this with the fact that the miners are selling the promise that all you need to do is plugin and go to make more money than you spent on it, you can see why it's a bit of a sketchy business model.
Other manufacturing equipment providers *sometimes* might need to worry about raw materials, skilled labour, licenses/laws to use the machines, etc etc.
Also, I think that a lot of manufacturers don't sell their equipment and *do* use it to make things to sell wholesale.  If a company makes a telephone cord making machine that can make them 5% cheaper than anywhere else then they may well keep it and not sell it.  Your premise that all manufacturing equipment makers sell their equipment may well in fact be false.
Only reason I can see why a company would sell a profitable money making machine is if they were bearish on the price of Bitcoin, or if they need to raise capital quickly for their next line of products/research.

I don't think you need to test this, you would definitely make a killing if you timed all the crypto markets perfectly.  Data would be fun though.  I'd guess you could at least 1000x your original principal over the last 18 months with 1 round trip a day.  Rules are important though as if you're allowed unlimited trades per day you might even make more.

I'd be wary of Havelock, you're placing a huge amount of trust in the issuing company.  Your surrendering a lot of legal rights/protections.


If these companies actually had any value they should have no problem getting angel funding, and angel funding is far more suitable for most of these companies than crowd investments (as an example the Moolah guy said he spends a lot of time managing the investors now, at an early stage time should be spent on product not managing dozens of people and their questions).
Truth be told, the reason most companies looking for funding ask for Bitcoin is that most Bitcoin investors are dumb money.
The point is, wanting to get your Bitcoins flowing and helping mobilise business is good in principal, but at the moment it's just totally not suitable for a multitude of reasons.
Aiming for modest returns for a ridiculously large risk is also not a good idea.  High risk should be high reward.  Modest risk should give modest rewards.  There are no modest/low risk Bitcoin investments at the moment imo.

So why did you buy now if you thought it was probable to go down in the short term?
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:54:38


Like most things, it depends.
Having multiple keys for chunks of your Bitcoins, and storing them all in the same place is a worse version of just having one key for all your Bitcoins.  If the one place gets attacked, you lose them all anyway and multiple keys are redundant.
If you store them in multiple places, you're vastly increasing your risks in many other ways.  As stated "it's correct to store your coins in multiple addresses", this is not a defacto truth.  Amateurs could take this advice and actually store their coins in an overall less secure way.

 * Mandatory audits on Bitcoin businesses that hold significant amounts of other peoples funds.  Audits could prove liquidity, trading volumes etc
 * Framework around handling consumer complaints
 * Disclosure of risks to consumers of using your service
 * Safeguarding of consumer Bitcoins (if you are an exchange that holds 10,000 BTC these should be ringfenced and not allowed to be touched for operational expenses etc)
 * Disaster recovery plans
There's a few I'd like to see.

That's assuming there's one miner out there mining all 3,600 coins a day.  Most miners make orders of magnitude less than that, and wont have any problems liquidating their daily/weekly/monthly earnings on exchanges.

But the OP says there's no third party needed to arbitrate transactions?
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:44:59


Yes, but your whole argument is based around the fact that a large miner would be willing to sell at a discount.  If I was a miner, the last thing I'd be doing is selling them for a discount when I have good exchanges on my doorstep I can sell them full price for.


I thought this was pretty well established, long gone are the days of low hanging fruits in mining.  It's highly competitive and risky.


In your other thread you said the market can't absorb 3,600 Bitcoin sales per day, when in fact the daily volume of exchanges can easily absorb this (if they aren't already).

I don't think so.  Investing in stocks is pretty darn easy (via actual ownership or CFD's for example).  Bitcoin is known as being difficult to get hold of, only recently would I say it's 'easy' with Circle and a few other services.
I'd say investing/speculating in stocks is generally still easier and safer than Bitcoin (from the point of view of being scammed along the way).

I'm no expert on accounting as we pay someone to do ours for us but regular cash or like cash operational expenses with no receipt, invoices etc will look super sketchy when you get audited by HMRC.

Why does it have any more weight by getting people to do it for free?  You think it weeds out the "non passionate" I suppose?  That's a false dichotomy and naive, getting people to work for you for free is not a catch all for the most passionate people.


At the end of the day you're asking for value add to your corporation/product from skilled workers, who you provide nothing tangible back in return for.
You're looking for code reviewers as well from what I can tell (not just comparing compiled sources) which is a really *really* skilled job if you want it done well.  Good luck getting good quality code reviews for free.  It just sounds to me like you don't want to pay anyone.

Maybe you know more about it than me, but the overwhelming impression I got from talking to people involved directly with technology and the banking industry was that they do move slowly, and it's one of the main drawbacks to think about when starting a FinTech startup.
The apps banks are producing are incredibly basic (the few I've seen here in the UK anyway).  I'd say this supports the idea they move slowly, apps have been around for years and banks are only just starting to introduce lackluster apps into the market.
My personal bank, their online banking has been available for years.  But it's still feature lacking, slow and generally useful for only the most basic of tasks.  It really hasn't changed much at all for as far back as I can remember.
I don't know about them laying telegraph cables down and all that, perhaps they were faster back then.  This is just my personal experiences, and information I was told from engineers and banking professionals in the conference.

Difference is with Google or any other central authority, they have the ability to penalise users once detected.  They can also keep their detection algorithms and methodologies secret.  Once detected, they can also manually review the user to make sure it's not a false positive.
With this decentralised market, the rep farm detection algorithms are entirely transparent which makes it pretty easy to subvert.  Also, what does this algorithm do exactly when it detects someone is gaming it?  Users will be able to easily know they are being penalised.  And how do you handle false positives?
I just can't see it ever working.  It might function for a while but once it gains enough popularity it will be riddled with scammers.  It's also quite possibly an impossible problem to solve without bringing in exterior third party centralised services who review sellers somehow.  I'm not sure if that would defeat the entire mission of the market place.

Define irreversible product? If it's one that can't be recalled after issue, then yes that's my business and livelihood and I've been doing it for a few years (I imagine you'll move the goalpost on this if you find out what it is though).
On one hand you're happy to heavily criticise Circle and look down on them stating how much better yours is going to be, yet on the other you seem to be designing something quite different and want to let everyone know why.  So I don't think your post was really a fair comparison, but a good advertising opportunity for you anyway.


You said rotated, rotation seems a little like security through obscurity to me?  Am I wrong here?  Maybe I am. I don't care anymore.


You too!  My default position with new financial business is one of great skepticism, understandable position in Bitcoin I'm sure you'll agree.
You've just shown me that you're not someone I'd want to do business with anyway, I attempted to originally engage you with genuine interest (look at my first post to you ) and I got mockery and passive aggression back.  Regardless as to if you're right or wrong that's childish and doesn't reflect well on you or your company.

Gift cards here in the EC are a little tricky VAT wise as no VAT is charged on the card until it's actually spent.
I guess a way of simplifying it would be that Bitcoins can be converted at store X into a $ gift card at any time.  That'd be nice to see, and Bitcoin is actually perfect for a gift card payment as it's a non reversible transaction.  When someone buys a gift card on CC, part pays for several orders and then chargebacks the original GC purchase it can be pretty complex to unravel.
That's why we don't currently sell gift cards in our store, but thinking about it there's no reason we couldn't accept Bitcoin.  However we'd have to deal with a lot of customers who want to buy them but can't.
After just re-writing our new store, the idea of accepting part payment with a gift card, bitcoin and the rest in CC sounds like a nightmare I wouldn't want to touch.  But GC + CC, where GC can be bought in advance with BC is a nice solution.

Guess what?  I live I the uk, and my local MP is Vince Cable, UK business secretary.  I went to see him about VAT and bitcoin, to ask him to remove it for Bitcoin.
Hey presto, shortly thereafter it was removed (and he told me me going to visit him was the reason why).  Now we have other EU countries following suit and UK is attracting more business.  Asking for change in the right way sometimes works, ignoring them and just doing what you want is lazy if you haven't even tried.

This is a red herring imo.  Anyone intending to use the charge back system to scam merchants will not obviously use Bitcoin.  Until merchants start dropping CC's entirely (and let's be honest this isn't going to happen any time soon), they will still have the same volume of charge back fraud.

They don't, trust me!  Looking at some of the funded loans illustrates this point well.


It doesn't matter if people aren't doing it yet, (and I suspect some people are, what the hell is a "reputation loan?" some people are borrowing sucesfully on?).  The opportunity to steal exists:
 * Borrow 100 Bitcoin over 1 month
 * Sell the Bitcoin in private
 * Price drops, repay the loan and pocket the difference (effectively a short) and build up reputation on your site
 * Price significantly increases, default and run with the money.
Please explain to me what you think will happen in the following scenario:
 * Bitcoin goes from $350 to $1,000 over the course of 1 week and stays there
Ignore the USD loans.  What default rate would you expect?  It's a time bomb waiting to go off.


You got people borrowing $1,000 USD at 60% APR over a 30 day period.  That's massively over what most credit cards would charge.  These people are either a) not shopping around or b) not able to shop around because no sane credit company would lend to them.


Either the marketing campaign is +EV for you in which case you self fund it, or it's not and you don't run it.  If people want to donate to you, it reflects far better on you to turn it down.  It looks really strange especially for a financial company with apparently nice margins.

I think most good news of recent is "merchant x accepts Bitcoin".  A lot of the Bitcoin community will rally to spend Bitcoin there to show support and hopefully go some way in proving its viability in wider industry.
This support puts a lot of downward pressure on the market as merchants will sell BTC for fiat straight away.  The announcement that a merchant will accept Bitcoin could be a good time to sell/short and rebuy in cheaper.
Paypal could be slightly different though, it depends on the details.

If you're going to say that, then I can say that libertarians suggest "if only you removed one more law, then competition would miraculously spring out of nowhere and fix the worlds problems".  It's not quite as simple as that now is it?
I think the reason regulation currently is failing is because of corrupt businesses epidemically infiltrating and corrupting governments.  They've managed to convince large parts of the population that the solution to this is to give them more freedom.
In one way I'd like to see a total hands off approach to Bitcoin from governments (not going to happen though) just to serve as a good example of how people will continually get screwed over (or not, which I doubt).
We both share the common ground that the current system is totally dysfunctional, the only difference is how we propose to attempt to fix it.


Preparing to get downvoted to oblivion because this sub is unfortunately turning into an echo chamber for libertarianism.  It's a shame because when alternate views are suggested the response is often extremely angry and threatening (I've had a bit of this on occasion, even been told to leave Bitcoin because it's not designed for me).  Your post for example is just basically asking for censorship on opposing views.  It's extremely non productive and is probably hurting the Bitcoin cause more than you think.  It's apparently becoming a celebrated way of dealing with difficult issues.
Let's not go down the route of debating our basal political beliefs, it's probably not going to change either of our minds.  But can we at least agree to meet criticism and opposing viewpoints with less aggression and patronising incredulity?  I'm close to unsubbing from this subreddit because it's just starting to become too much, not the greatest loss ever but I like to think I'm a positive member of the Bitcoin community and have done my best to further it in many ways, lobbying government, giving talks in London, introducing it to the local community and supporting it through my business.  I'm starting to become quite disillusioned by it all and if this is the way things are going I'm not sure I'll want to be so hands on with it any more.

I don't think making gambling illegal is possible or a good idea.
In reality, I'm OK with casinos et al because I have to be, I just would like to see them tightly regulated.  Much in the same way I think most drugs should be legalised as well.  Every gambling site in the UK has self exclusions, self bans etc etc.  They've actually stopped me before in the past and saved me a couple of times.
I just think that unregulated, irresponsible (they offer no safeguards except a checkbox asking if you're over 18 - why bother?) and limitless gambling websites using Bitcoin is a bad idea.
The thread a while ago about the guy who lost all his BTC, then took out CC's and lost more was depressing at best.  Most of the profits come from these sort of people.
If this dice site is shut down, it's no true loss to Bitcoin at the end of the day.  All they are doing is wiping out some early adopters and consolidating wealth.  The 'fun' utility really pales in comparison.

I'm not intimately familiar with mining hardware, but they seem to sell it as "plug it in, make money".
I don't get why they wouldn't buy a warehouse, and plug in as many themselves as they can to live the dream themselves.  Setting up a warehouse with computers running in it seems way less complex than building the hardware... they've done the hard part now why not go the whole way?
I would say the fact many of them actually do do this behind customers backs shows that it's not actually that hard?

I run my own successful startup, and we sell a digital product for $130.
As a test, I put out an ad on Brakwer for a copy of our product at a 20% discount.  I got a few offers very quickly.
How on earth are these people able to do this and why?  We do not offer those sorts of discounts.  I don't understand how Brakwer works.  I don't see how the business model makes sense without being a middleman for fraud.  Conveniently, if a chargeback does occur Brakwer is at arms length from the transaction so it will be unlikely you'd be chased in any way.  Business models I don't understand or don't feel right I steer clear from.  And there are/have been lots in Bitcoin world.
I'd like to accept a few orders as a test and see what happens and publish the results, but I fear the chargebacks.  It'd be a very expensive test.  I might try and do it for some cheaper products in the future and see what happens.
If they are chargebacked, what recourse can you offer to me if any?

It's hardly surprising that a large buy order would affect the EMA in this way then...
We just saw a large buy order, quite possibly from a single purchase.  EMA is weighted towards the most recent data, so no wonder the EMA goes up and we see some crossovers.  Correlating this indicator to a change in market direction/sentiment is surely erroneous in this context.
If people are really good at TA, wouldn't it be better to apply it in a far more liquid market?  Like forex?  Applying TA to an asset with a short unproven and highly volatile history, riddled with manipulation and with a small enough total dollar value to be easily rocked by the odd whale seems pointless.

100% agree


I think it would be pretty easy to demonstrate this, as one example Enron right to the bitter end of the Californian Energy crisis was lobbying government for less regulation as a solution to the issue that they were intentionally causing.
Big businesses *frequently* form cartels, [here's an example on a canned mushroom cartel](  I can't help but think the idea that the only reason a new canned mushroom company hasn't emerged from the market to break the cartel is because of repressive regulation is naive.  These cartels are powerful, anti competitive and will only become more so if you strip away more rules.

I agree that the law has a lot of shortfalls, but the alternative of letting the free market reign free is frightening especially considering what they have/already get away with.  So we should be working to improve the law and regulation and not write it off.

Remember, solvency audit just shows it's solvent at that particular point in time.  That's all.  Exchanges can still become insolvent.
It's good exchanges are getting solvency reports, but the next step should be publishing a calendar of planned solvency audits.  If they don't get a report published on the date published in advance it should be a warning signal.  The calendar should have frequent solvency reports (maybe one a month for example).  It should be a regular committal not a one off, or when they feel like doing them.

That could be 10 users.  Or 1,000 users each with $1,000.  Seems quite pitiful in my opinion based on a $90,000,000 valuation.
If they make an incredibly optimistic 10% profit on deposits per year they make $100k a year, and it'd take 900 years to break even.  I just fail to see any justification for that valuation.  Maybe I'm missing something though.

Luck is a large part of it in my opinion.
Back in 2011 it was a high variance, high risk bet.  You bet $100 on it, 99.9% of the time you lose that $100.  0.1% of the time you make $1m (or whatever).  It's a +EV bet, but a bet a sensible person could perhaps still label as 'lucky' when it does pull through.
You could say you had foresight, but it's worth stepping back every now and then.  Look at how passionately people talk about other coins in alt coin subreddits, or penny stocks in other forums, or their new app ideas in startup meetups.  It's easy to get swept up when you invest in something with time and/or money, put your blinders on to the negatives and become, at least in part, an irrational believer.
Perhaps at the time it actually was irrational, and here we are today applauding our foresight when in fact we are just fortuitous members of a self-selecting prophecy.

Hi Tim,
"Sporadically shitting on [you]" is a little harsh but there you go.  In my business we've taken flack here and there but I don't recall ever addressing the criticism in that way even if tempted at times, but this is Bitcoin world so things are done differently I guess (not the first time I've been called our similarly by a Bitcoin business when raising some questions).
I'll turn down you offer although I appreciate it's generosity, but as a counter I'd like my criticism addressed directly which is namely:
 - Roughly how did you arrive to a $90m valuation?
 - How many MAU's do you have?
 - How new users are you attracting?
I imagine you'll decline to tell me these things, but that data wasn't apparently available in your offered information for prospective investors on Crowdcube, which unless I missed it I would consider to be perhaps a little unethical/misleading.
Correct me if I'm wrong of course though.
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:05:36
Sorry, I didn't mean it to come off as a personal attack at all, I'm just genuinely curious about the whole thing as well and enjoy learning and discussing it!


My observations are that people give far too much weighting to TA than they should for Bitcoin, it's a piece of the puzzle perhaps but a very small one at that.  I would contest that it gives any insight at all, due to it's malleability.

This is not as common occurrence as their blog post suggests.  Garbage in, garbage out.  That's their starting argument (garbage in) for the reason why you can get a 70% discount (garbage out).
I'm struggling to think of when you'd pay someone in Amazon gift cards over cash, for a sizeable amount, where the recipient has no use for it.  Like, where is this market paying people in Amazon gift cards?
And pre Bitcoin, where is a comparable marketplace for buying gift cards at discount?  It must of existed right because it's a big problem for people being paid in Amazon vouchers right?
It's another "too good to be true" thing duping naive Bitcoiners.  I don't think most Bitcoiners are actually that naive, but convince themselves it's all kosher because they are at arms distance from it and it directly benefits them.

There's nothing wrong with cash in the bank.  It's the safest (insured by banks and governments), most liquid (you can buy anything with USD) and fairly stable.
Why is everyone so keen to dump their cash?  A bank might not be the best place to put it from a growth potential point of view but it's better to keep hold of it than make a big mistake with it.  You have to avoid making mistakes as much as you have to try and make good decisions, both are equally important.
If I was him, I'd probably put $10k on Bitcoin (I have high risk tollerance and 20% my entire cash savings is definitely risky enough) and then keep the $40k for a deposit on a house, or whatever life throws at you later on.
I think buying BTC is a hedge against USD.  If USD does collapse for some reason, BTC will probably do quite well.  You wouldn't need many of them either.  If you invest entirely in BTC your missing out on a nice hedging opportunity imo (could be wrong I'm not an expert on this).

No idea about the trustworthiness about that particular site.  However I would comment that some bets offered on the site (e.g. "Vimeo to add Bitcoin tips before August 2014") are bad bets because the outcome of the bets can be highly influenced by a small group of individuals.  I'd steer clear of these sorts of bets.
As to bets on price hitting $500, seems like a pretty easy one to make in favor of yes at the current situation.  Can't help but feel current odds are a bit too good to be true though, there's a chance you've found a good opportunity though.  At the end of the day all comes down to trust of Bitbet.

I didn't know this.  I think it's worth remembering that the financial sector is extremely powerful and anti competitive, setting up a new business that attempts to attack some of the banks most profitable arms is something I think we should all generally be positively receptive to.
Unfortunately for new financial businesses taking up the Bitcoin flag in any shape of form probably poses significant risk to them for moderate if any benefit.  For example it may threaten any relationships with institutes they have that are required to operate their business.  This isn't necesserially a problem with these new businesses themselves, but a problem caused by the industry they are attempting to operate in.  We should make sure we blame the right people.

Bitcoin exchanges are core for its success and wider adoption, they are gateways for adoption.
Regardless, if you think it's only problematic for exchanges take a look at the value differential between USD prices (most liquid) and GBP (less liquid).  It's regularly a 10% difference.  Part of the reason for this difference is the logisitical barriers that exist for uk buyers (often restricted to purchase via international xfer which involves fees) and the illiquidity in itself.
Allowing progressive laws to encourage Bitcoin in the uk will break down these barriers and help promote adoption.  Until then everyone in the uk will have to pay higher costs.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:19:43
Diversity is key.  Don't forget, as Bitcoin increases in value if all your assets are losing value or increasing at a slower rate your portfolio is becoming less and less diverse.  And due to the nature of Bitcoin, more and more weighted towards a higher risk profile.
Also worth mentioning is that when a stock goes down in value people will say it's "not a loss until you sell".  On the same coin if you invest in Bitcoin it's not a gain until you sell.  You can argue that Bitcoin has more utility than a shareholding so it doesn't strictly apply, but Bitcoin *currently* doesn't have anywhere near the same utility as cash does nowadays.
Savings also is a bit of a clumsy word.  Savings is the [verbal noun for save]( and the word save originates from ideas such as "[to deliver from some danger; rescue from peril, bring to safety](  I don't think moving fiat currency into Bitcoin fits in with that idea too well!

Really sorry to hear this.  You're attitude is admirable though.  I've suffered monetary loss before when I was younger (I am 27 atm, and had a rough gambling experience when I was around 22 or so).  It can be really tough to get through but I look back at it now as a moment in my life where I came to understand a lot.
You'll bounce back.
As a side point, I wish exchanges would add pending features.  IE, any withdrawl is queued for 24 hours before it's released.  It gives you 24 hours to press a button on the account saying "freeze" and then these transfers can be blocked.

The premise that it's safer than anything out there is definitively false and you should try and step back and take another look, making a big life decision based on something false is not a good idea.
If you don't diversify you're playing with fire in a big way.
What's your objective with your money?  Safety or growth?  Where you put it is often a compromise between the two.  Bitcoin leans extremely to the side of growth potential but this costs a lot in safety.

Not sure why everyone thinks this is going to change anything?  They are both just arbitary units, there is no parity.  If Satoshi decided that 42 million Bitcoins would be in existence, they would be worth 1/2 as much and everyone would own twice as many, and the 'parity' would require a 2x price increase from where it is today.

Hungry people need feeding.  A lot of reasons why they are hungry are for all intents and purposes completely out of any charities control as they are in part caused by complex macro socio economic influences.  If you want to solve hunger and homlessness you've got a monumental mountain to climb.
I'm all for trying to find sustainable solutions, but I don't think we should criticise a charity feeding hungry people.  Short term, people need help.  You're pointing the finger in the wrong place.

Thanks!  Airscape was made in Construct 2 by someone who was 16 at the time which we think is pretty amazing.  We love seeing what our users come up with, it's a real perk of the job!
There are 3 of us at Scirra. My brother Ashley, me and we are fortunate to have a full time graphic designer working for us from Brazil, Paulo.  We also have an awesome community of users and mods who help and support us in many ways!
Visions for the future?  We're currently focussed on making Construct 2 as good as it possibly can be :)  Once we've nailed that (and we think we're getting close) we have a couple more ideas to start exploring.  One major feature we're thinking about right now is better multiplayer support for HTML5 games, but it's a very difficult problem.

To me that looks like it would simply reduce variance, and not actually be any more +EV than just buying at todays price.
Reduction of variance really isn't that important if your buying at and early stage with the objective to hold long term.  I prefer to keep things simple!

A randomly generated string of equal length will always be better.  You want to avoid patterns, real words are patterns.
Also with strings of words you're probably not going to introduce overly complex capitalisation rules.  You'll do a leading capital, a capital on the first letter etc.  That's helping reduce the search space a lot again.
Again, you'll probably pick words that form coherent sentences or phrases, again, reducing the search space significantly.
Again, you'll probably not pick words that are long, hard to spell, or are highly obscure.  Reduction of search space again.
You can do basic combinatronics to show how it might be secure, but I think there's a huge capacity for pruning the search space, a lot of these permutation calculations are over simplified.

Bitcoin trending on Yahoo is an *effect* of something.  Does anyone know what the *cause* of this is?
Until then, I think we should all perhaps be a little skeptical.  These trends are open to manipulation.  The Bitcoin market reacts very emotionally so there is definite benefit to manipulating these trends for personal gain (pump and dump).
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:52:54
Really?  Common consensus is that in 10 years Bitcoin will be worth orders of magnitude more, or nothing.
If you invest 100% of your life savings, you will either make lets say $10mm, or $0.
If you invest 50% of your life savings, you will either make $5mm or $0.  Yet you still have $25k contingency in your savings for when you need it.
You're first millions will have the most utility to you, your later millions will have far less utility to you.  Exposing yourself to increased risk on the chance you'll make more millions that will have far less impact on your life is basically greed.
Investing 100% over 50% your savings has moderately better upside in terms of impact on your life, but a disproportionate downside being that you've got no savings for a long time.
Why not just invest 50% of the savings.  You're still going to make millions if it pans out.  And you'll still have savings if it doesn't pan out.  And you might need money in the future.
Investing 100% of your savings in a super high risk super high reward place is gambling, plain and simple.  Do you really have the character to write it off if it zeros out and carry on life as normal?  I wouldn't, not many people can tolerate that sort of loss.  Don't romanticise about big losses and big gains.  It's going to blur your judgement.  And when you actually are sitting there $50k down in the future you'll feel like an idiot, and you'll feel like shit for a long time.  It's sobering.  I've been there, and it hurts.
**Don't egg people on to invest everything they own.  Highly unethical.**  I can't stress this enough.  There's a chance this guy could be setting himself up to ruin his life.  No one here knows how he would cope with that loss if it did happen.
I can't beleive people are actually supporting this idea. People are generally rubbish at evaluating risk and reward.    And the worst thing about it is that people often think they are good at evaluating it.  Very high risk very high reward isn't something you throw your entire life savings at obviously.  *Obviously*.
If that's the best investment advice you've seen for a long time, well, I don't know what to say really.  It's the worst investment advice I've read, pretty much ever.  The stuff about writing off potentially devastating losses like this as "*experiences and memories*" that will "*be with you always*" made me laugh out loud just from the total absurdity of it.
I don't care if this post makes me look like an asshole, because I want to try and stop people destroying their lives.

The questions are:
 - Is there definitely going to be a pop? Past history has limited bearing on future.
 - There is no guarantee the price it is now is going to be more than the bottom of the dip in the future if a pop does happen
 - It's virtually impossible buy at the bottom of the dip so it's not an efficient strategy
 - The market seems to react fast as well so there's a good chance you might miss the opportunity if it does present itself
For amateur investors (of which I am firmly one) I see buying now and holding long term to be a pretty unexploitable strategy that doesn't lend itself to making costly mistakes that buying on dips seems to.

Bitcoin is no where near the value of gold. Gold is worth [around $8 trillion]( whereas Bitcoin is worth [$13 billion](  So Gold is worth over 600 times more than Bitcoin.
The 'gold parity' is nonsense, it's just a good headline.  Imagine if there were half as many Bitcoins in the system by design (10.5 million not 21 million).  'Gold parity' would of been reached a long time ago as each unit would be worth about twice as much.  It's meaningless, just arbitary units.
Real gold parity will be when the total dollar value of gold and bitcoin are the same.  And we'll be living in a very different world if that ever happens.

Charge ~0.25% for trades, naively assume their volume doesn't drop and they are making ~500 BTC commission per day.
500 BTC per day = $250,000 per day, and they own the platform to trade it in for fiat as well.

Haha, my link is also a referal :)
I speculate they do it cheaper by either:
* Directly matching trading parties
* Having access to be able to trade at more competitive market rates
Or a combination of both.
Transfering currency is incredibly easy for banks to do, perhaps they easiest thing for them.  Yet they are often the most expensive!  This directly contradicts capitalist theory, here we have a service every large banking corporation offers yet it is not a service that is highly competitive nor are prices being driven down.  It's basically a rip off.
Using BTC as a tool to exchange currency is something I've looked at some depth into but you can only gain a very small gain compared to TransferWise so the additional effort/risk is probably not worth it for most people.  However, I find it exciting because it shows that Bitcoin allows anyone to set up various financial services that can be extremely competitive.  As BTC becomes more liquid, I hope to see more of these sorts of startups competing in this space.

@_date: 2013-10-20 22:53:27
I made serious efforts to do so, but failed because the banks wont let me.  So now I'm [trying to lobby]( and find out more information with [FOI requests]( - which depressingly are being shot down citing exemptions relating to formulation of new policy.  It's all super duper secret and we're not allowed to know what they are talking about or thinking about regarding Bitcoin.
It's all a very slow process though.  And Bitcoin doesn't share the [tax benefits fiat currency enjoys]( (VAT exemption for example) which makes it pretty much impossible to create a viable business selling Bitcoin.
To allow for users to sell their Bitcoin for fiat, it also looks likely that you would need to register with [MLR]( as it's possible this would be considered a "Money Transmission Service".  (Hard to pin down the UK definition but in such cases it would be advised to get an answer in writing before choosing a definition which suits you best).  This is doable, and fairly cheap.  But is just one layer of bureaucracy.
tldr; Complicated from operational point of view, up against [strong anti competitive behavior]( from the banks and uncompetitive classifications of Bitcoin.
Also a reasonable amount of starting capital is probably required to seed an exchange, or just to sell with. (£10's of k's probably if you want to run a smooth service).  If you are selling BTC and are taking modest quantities of orders you will probably run into cash flow problems fairly quickly as the cycle process is going to be slow.
Margins are also fairly low for this sort of thing, you need a lot of volume to make reasonable profit.  This sort of level of risk for moderate profits at least to start with is not appealing for a lot of entrepreneurs.
Seriously worth repeated reinforcement is that running an exchange is probably one of the riskiest online businesses you could attempt run.  My idea I'm trying to get going is to initially sell only, then slowly evolve it into an exchange.  Going straight bang into an exchange is not something I would be comfortable doing, it's a far more complex model, will put you on the map for some really good hackers.  Anyone attempting this better have rock solid abilities, or have the capital to hire programmers/security experts to review/write the code.  It's the sort of thing you literally can't afford to make mistakes on, and launching an exchange on day 1 is the riskiest of all strategies.

If possible, I think in the long term it's better to avoid interacting with services that grief users interacting with it with Bitcoin transactions.
It could reflect very badly on Bitcoin to new users.  Users who get scammed using these services may forever lament the murkiness and dangers of Bitcoin for the rest of their lives.  Better to just educate and strongly advise everyone to blacklist services that aren't committed to the Bitcoin cause.

You should possibly consider using a trailing average for volume, not live volumes.
People are trying to exit MtGox.  Because they are, the price artifically rises, as does the volume.  Artifically high volumes and artifically high prices mean the price you show on your website is off by a fair margin in my opinion.

Of course I don't know what the future will bring.  It can go up or down.  But can you explain to me how dollar cost averaging could possibly increase your expected value?
If you're saying dollar cost average as it will help the investor sleep, I would say that investor probably isn't ready to invest in Bitcoin if they don't understand the volatility risk (and of course they shouldn't of speculated more than they could afford to put at risk).

Everyone has different objectives/goals with their Bitcoin.  I used to be scared/excited by it all, but am more Zen like about it all now!  What happens, happens.  We bought some a while ago, and are holding confidently.
Surveying peoples strategies and plans is probably a pretty redundant exercise, two people can hold the same amount of Bitcoin but have vastly different plans for them but at the same time they can both be making the right decision.  The correctness of a plan is hugely dependant on personal circumstance.
I have a lot of experience with gambling, so am mentally prepared for any losses and have had life experiences where I suffered perceived devastating losses.
My biggest fear is for other people that believe they can take this sort of loss, because you don't quite know how it's going to affect you until you experience it yourself.  This is why it's always important to reiterate the fact that you should not speculate more on Bitcoin than you can afford to lose, or are prepared to lose.  If Bitcoin does zero out, I expect to read about a lot of resultant tragedy.

Point 2, we bought and held.  Post China crash, we're still up 400%.  If we spread the purchases out over a longer period we would be up a lot less.  Post China crash, we never saw as a good opportunity to buy more because we'd already bought them all at a much lower rate.
I'm not trying to be faceteous, I just can't see any benefit to spreading out purchases once you have decided to invest n% of your capital in a particular asset that is trending upwards.
Bitcoin stocks and shares and scam riddled and many by nature are unsafe from multiple points of views.  I really wouldn't advise someone struggling to work out how to buy Bitcoins to invest in these sorts of businesses.  Doing "thorough" research is one thing, being able to critically analyse your research, avoid the scams, not become emotionally attached/motivated and evaluate the risk/EV of business investment opportunities is something most people are entirely incapable of doing.
For most people buying Bitcoin who are nervous/new to speculation and investment, I see reduction of opportunity to make mistakes one of the most important thing which boils down to buy and hold.  Any layers ontop of this increases the opportunity for mistakes.
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:49:20
Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:55:33
Of course it can go either way, that's what [expected value]( is about.
The point is, many people thinking buying over periods somehow has a greater expected value than just buying all in one go.  I do not think this is true at all.  I think it reduces variance, but this does not affect your EV.

@_date: 2013-10-21 15:27:31
Nope.  The exchanges can shut down, run, burn down, get hacked etc.  If you're planning on day trading BTC ask yourself:
 * Is the additional risk worthwhile
 * Do you actually have an edge
 * Is that edge significantly higher than just buy and hold?

Currently doing multiplayer will require you to do your own coding at some level.  As our tool is aimed at people who don't know how to code, this makes it difficult (impossible?) to come up with a solution that would work for most cases.
If you're confident at programming, you can use our [Javascript SDK]( to create custom plugins for the client side part of it, but you'd need to probably write a server as well.
Multiplayer can be the hardest aspect of game creation, turn based is generally not too hard and less demanding from a coding and resource point of view, but real time games are difficult.
Good news is as games in Construct 2 are made in HTML5, you can use [AJAX]( (suitable perhaps for some turn based type games) or [websockets]( for more demanding multiplayer games.
If you're new to this sort of thing, writing an AJAX chat room, evolve it into a lobby, and then perhaps evolve it again into a lobby to match 1v1 turn based board games might be a good place to start!

No, this doesn't affect EV.  Inverse your argument.  If you don't buy and the price goes up more than it is currently, you'll be sorry you have to buy at a higher price.
Spreading out your purchases will reduce your variance, but it's not going to change your EV.
As an example, we bought all in one go and held.  We're still up ~400% even post China crash.  If we spread the purchases over a couple of months we might be up in the region of ~150-300%.
Spreading out the purchases is often presented as the risk averse strategy, when infact it is not so.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:58:57

Unlikely to be a sudden process.  And if anyone has the bravery (stupidity?) to sit on their Bitcoins past the phase where gains will no longer have any meaningful impact on their quality of life (what's the difference between owning $50m and $100m?) then good for them!  But as the price increases people will start liquidating.  Everyone's holdings will not be the same in the future and along this path.

Thanks for the question!  Ashley (my brother) is the one who actually writes Construct 2 itself.  All his experience was with Windows development, so for safety's sake he took the decision to write it for Windows as that's what he knew best.  Windows also had the biggest market share so it seemed like the best decision.  Also, the [open source predecessor]( was written for Windows so a Windows based audience had already been established.
We know there's definitely a demand for supporting other OS's, and we will address this at some point in the future (stay tuned).  As a small company (there's only 3 of us) porting it to Linux or Mac currently would be difficult from a resource point of view.
At the time when he chose to go HTML5 exclusive as export for Construct 2 it felt a little risky as the debate about HTML5 vs Flash was still raging strong.  I haven't heard any whispers of that old chesnut for a while now!  And no one knew what device support for HTML 5 would be like.  Nowadays it's approaching native performance so it looks like the gamble paid off nicely.  It also means we have 1 plugin environment, and 1 codebase to maintain.  Multiple exporters can create headaches, so again it's paid off in that regard!
Almost daily I'm overwhelmed by the emails and support we get from our users, and how much I read about them enjoying using Construct 2.  Ashley's executed an amazing feat of engineering.

Such a big disparity is a bad sign.  They aren't even posting anything on their website, Twitter etc.  I think they must be in a lot of trouble.
If everyone is buying BTC with their MtGox balances (because they can't cash them out) it will increase the price of BTC on MtGox which is what we're seeing now.  Also, if people are doing this MtGox will have an artifically high trading volume.  (This will skew prices on Bitcoin Average et al)
The market is saying that $1 USD on MtGox is worth ~$0.80 USD in cash.  The actual cash value of $1 USD on MtGox might be a lot lower.  If you think $1 USD on MtGox is worth &gt;$0.80 cash, then you can take advantage of this opportunity if you have a high risk tolerance.
When Full Tilt Poker started going broke people would sell their balances for less than face value ([here's someone who sold $6,000,000 of FTP $USD for around 85% it's face value](  This is basically what's happening on MtGox now, people selling their money balances for 20% loss.

I'm pleased with the order flow, one of the main perceived benefits of Bitcoin is annonyminity.  Sites that ask you for personal details contradicts this so I'm trying to offer a service that's a bit more relevant.
Price volatility is something I'm working on.  As it stands, an order is an agreement between the customer and I that I will buy Bitcoins at the market rate with their money after my fees have been deducted.  I am hoping to implement a protection option (IE, cancel my order if by the time it gets to trade the price has increased &gt;= 20%).  However I'm still thinking about how to implement this in a way that fits with the current flow, and investigating any legal responsibilities I might have if I start making bank transfers to customers (even if they are just refunds).

Point 4 and 5 conflict surely.  You say hold and spend unless you're a seasoned trader, but point 5 suggest investing 10% of your holding in high risk startup companies.  I consider myself fairly clued up on Bitcoins and startups and I would not recommend anyone invest in these companies unless they know exactly what they are doing.
Also point 2, why not buy all at once?  We did.  If you don't buy all at once, you've also missed a huge opportunity if the price goes up.  I don't see how spreading out the purchase affects your EV.

UK BTC prices are inflated, I'm guessing because it's hard to buy them.
Current price at time of this post is £152.02 on LocalBitcoins, or $230.03 USD on Bitstamp.
$230.03 USD = ~£144, that's a &gt;5% discount.
Bittlicious currently is £158, buying from Bitstamp is creeping close to a 10% discount now.
If you're buying a few hundred quids worth for convenience you can buy from LocalBitcoins.  If you're investing a lot more or have frugal OCD, consider buying via Bitstamp.  Bitstamp has additional fees (small deposit fees, small amount lost in Forex, trading fees) but you'll end up with slightly more BTC which is worth doing if you're going for a larger amount.
I like Bitstamp, other exchanges might offer even better discount but they might pose as higher risk for various reasons.

Once you got $1,100 of credit on MtGox, what you going to do with it?
@_date: 2013-08-19 17:03:15
I'm not too up to date with it, but I don't think so.  However this news article seems to suggest players will get their money back soon:
For poker, not being able to cash out your balance could destroy your career.  Even more career destroying would be never ever being able to cash out your balance as FTP goes into adminsitration.  When you look at it from that point of view, 15% premium seems like a fairly cheap exit.
Going back to Bitcoin, even if users do eventually get their money back, they could still have lost out big time.  That's unused money that could of been in a savings account getting interest, or invested in Bitcoin and (hopefully) making a good return. Or even just money you might need for an emergency IRL.
People generally aren't good with coping and evaluating risk.  If you're one of these people, you will have a very stresful time not being able to access your cash balance on MtGox.
Not being able to cash out in the short term really is quite bad and I guess a lot of people think paying 20% to get out now is a price worth paying.

I'm not worried.  So much positive press recently, this usually has a ~10 day lag before we see the benefits of wider adoption due to the time it takes for new people to get money on the exchanges.
Some exchanges are currently being ddosed as well, this could have a funny effect on the prices.
Look at the long term picture anyway:
Price disparity between exchanges is huge (namely CNY and USD), this means there's still a lot of movement to come but which way is anyone's guess.
I still expect it to trend upwards as it has for years now!

There's a lot of weird responses in this post, for a perfectly reasonable question.


Say for example you're selling drugs on the street and you make £20k a month doing this.  Depositing £20k cash a month into your bank is going to raise some eyebrows perhaps.  You might get a tax inspector coming round your house asking you where you're getting this cash from.
Not depositing the cash in the bank and keeping it on your person in some capacity is an option, but it's not a great one.  If you want to buy a house it's going to be difficult.  You might get away with buying nice cars.  You might also get robbed.
You need to put it somewhere safe.  Banks are great for that.
Ever see "Breaking Bad?"  They set up a car wash business.  Car wash businesses are cash rich, most people pay in cash.  So running this business it would be easy to change the books to show you processed more washes than you actually did.  You can now move this illegitimately earned cash through the business under fake orders, pay your 20% tax on it and enjoy the 80% left over.
Bitcoin's can be used to launder cash.  You have a lot of illegitimately earned cash you can probably find a lot of happy reliable sellers who will give you BTC for a 10% markup and respect your privacy.  Now you have these Bitcoins, you can send them through a mixing service and then simply sell them on a large exchange.  Once you sell them, pay your capital gains tax and deposit what's left in the bank.  If anyone asks, just say you won them on a Bitcoin betting website, or that you were an early investor in Bitcoin.

Why not just reclassify a Bitcoin.
Currently 1 BTC = $1,000 and there can only be 21 million
Move the decimal place over a few spots:
1 BTC = $1 USD, and there can only be 2.1 billion of them
1 BTC = $0.10 USD, and there can be 21 billion of them
Too much talk imo about uBitcoins, microbitcoins etc etc.  Why don't we stick to "Bitcoin" and just reduce it's value in all clients.

In a court, if a buyer said they purchased a TV for 1 BTC, were legally entitled to a full refund and received 0.5 BTC back, I'm not sure if everyone would consider that a fair resolution.
Unlikely, but worth considering perhaps.  I think if merchants have clear refund policies regarding Bitcoin on their sites it would serve as some protection at least.
I'm fairly sure some consumer protection acts in some countries somewhere coupled with a volatile currency could create an explotable situation.

They can vary wildly from the actual numbers, easy to game (which some businesses would be motivated to do) and they suffer from large selection bias.
From an outside perspective it's very hard to estimate traffic to a website.  For looking at possible impact of business x accepting Bitcoin, better to look and see if that business has any published finances as this would be a much better indicator in my opinion.

Problem isn't just selling, it's buying as well.  Difference between usd rate and gbp according to bitcoinaverage.com can be as much as 10%, this is a consequence of illiquidity and logistical difficulties in buying for uk citizens.  This is unfair on uk buyers and is a huge barrier for more widespread adoption for sure.
Uk government curreny isn't helping (save Vince Cables solitary efforts) yet they are happy to capital gains tax any profit we make from them if we do decide to sell.

Bitstamp is good, but note it will take a couple of weeks from when you sign up to when you're able to buy.  Also your bank will likely charge you a ~£25 fee to arrange the international transfer.  Bitstamp is best for larger orders (a few k+ in my opinion).
LocalBitcoins is good to buy Bitcoins *today* and for smaller orders.
Avoid Paypal, Ebay etc.  Stick to LocalBitcoins, Bitstamp

I think the Winklebro's current holding is worth in the region of ~$50m.
[This site]( suggests Zuckerman is worth $20bn.
20 billion / 50 million = 400
So current price of Bitcoin ~$400 would have to rise 400x in value ($160,000 per Bitcoin)
If one Bitcoin is worth $160,000 *and* if the Winklebro's have not sold any of their holdings they will be about there.  To not sell any of your Bitcoin holdings when you've obtained billionaire status is likely a bold venture into complete stupidity (unless the USD dies and Bitcoin really is the future of currency), so unless MySpace makes an unlikely comeback and destroys Facebooks stock value it's not likely they could be worth more than Zuckerman with Bitcoin alone.

For it to reach critical mass much more liquidity needs to be introduced into the market.
The liquidity is a culmination of several issues:
 - Backwards tax laws in various countries
 - Bitcoin still being perceived by large groups as illegitimate
 - Uncertain political future
 - Bitcoin still seen as high risk (in various ways)
 - Anti competitive behaviour/foot dragging from the banking sector
As liquidity increases you'll see larger trade volumes and narrower gaps with regards to price disparity between currencies (the more liquid Bitcoin is the easier it will be to exploit artbitrage opportunities which will close these price differences up).

I love bitcoin, but I don't like "Defence Distibuted".   As a Brit what they are doing sits very uncomfortably with me.  I think creating a 3d printed pistol called the "Liberator" is quite distasteful.
Also from an interview:
"Wilson, not surprisingly, sees working with the government as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s fundamental purpose."
I totally disagree.  Government in my opinion can and should be a force of good in society (not saying it currently is).  I'm not surprised bitcoin is so appealing to libertariansim but I find these views to be too extremist.

If only it were that simple... I'd love to see people actually benchmark their abilities to buy in the dips and sell at the peaks against buy and hold.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:43:52
One of the most damaging statements I keep reading is "wait for the next dip, and buy cheap".
This is often presented a risk adverse strategy, when in fact it is equally as risky as just buying right now.  
If you wait for the next dip (and I've seen people parotting this since ~$300) and it doesn't come then you decide to enter you've lost out big time.  If you've been waiting for a dip since $300 and decide to buy in now at $600, you'll have 50% less Bitcoin than you would of it you just bought them at the price they were on that day.
Buy now, and hold.  It's the superior strategy in this sort of market.  Anyone saying a dip is coming doesn't know what they are talking about.  One might come, one might not.  Who knows.  Keep it simple, if you want Bitcoin just get them as soon as you can and sit on them.

Re: offshore banking, I consider it to be a bandaid solution.  The fact that customers have to pay international transfer fees is a barrier for wider adoption, and goes part way to explain the ~10% price differential between USD/GBP on BTC.
I'd like to see a UK exchange with a UK bank account, it will reduce this gap and make it easier for people to buy Bitcoin.
In startup culture there's a lot of good articles out there all about improving sales by stripping down various barriers on payment pages (for example not having to register to buy etc).  I see offshore banks as barriers, and removal of these barriers could really have a big impact.

Absolute dollar values aren't a good way to phrase the question in my opinion, you want to deal with percentages.
If Bitcoin fluctuated that many orders of magnitude every 10 minutes... it just wouldn't.  You're asking for the consequences of impossible levels of volatility.  If it did predictably fluctuate like that I'd be buying on $5 and selling on $900.  Everyone would do this until the price stabilised somewhere in the middle.
As to the tolerance of variance a remittance company can operate under, this totally depends on their business model.  Some companies might decide to swallow the loss and chalk it up to variance.  Some fluctuations will be in their favor, some wont be.  Regarding gain/loss from these fluctuations this could either establish a neutral expected value, or if they are bullish on Bitcoin in general slightly higher expected value.
Other remittance companies might structure themselves so that they are able to liquidate Bitcoins fast to avoid any exposure to the volatility.
Any exposure to the volatility of the Bitcoin market would require higher starting capital to be able to absorb losses due to variance.
Disclaimer:  I'm an amateur, but these are my thoughts.  If I've said something wrong someone please correct me!
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:46:54
Everyone perceives losses differently.  When bitcoin was vertical we read stories about people maxing out cc to buy in which have often been retold romantically.  Those successes likely motivated others to take similar risks, some of which would be less fortunately timed.  Those ill advised breed of gambles are likely still happening.
The problem with great perceived loss is that embarrassment and shame (two feelings many gamblers are intimately accustomed to) will prevent these people reaching out for help.
They may be few, but I'm sure there are desperate people out there.  Perhaps the post in question was hyperbolic but I think the intention was sincere and we should never dismiss people in help if they do reach out,  or should we ever mock them no matter how subtle.
Sometimes it's just nice to know there are people out there thinking of you no matter how threadbare that link might be.
