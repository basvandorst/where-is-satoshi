The logical way to store a bitcoin long term is a paper wallet, password protected, in duplicate in different locations. Something tamper evident, like cast in a concrete block. Or engraved on a metal card welded inside a steel tube or something.

Is the notion of canadian dollars scary? It's different, and presumably you don't have any Canadian bank account or means for earning Canadian dollars for work?  
Same thing....it's an alternative currency. Switching from one currency to another is harder than sticking with what you're set up to use, but that's because the work is behind you. At one point you had to learn how it works, you had to create accounts, you had to prove your identity to the satisfaction of the government or whatever.   
Starting from scratch today, zero established method of transferring value from one person to another....you'd chose bitcoin, its way easier. It's like a numbered swiss account with no identity or process for signing up.   
But understanding why bitcoin is trustworthy, learning the fundamentals of cryptography...that's harder, but so would starting your own bank.

I didn't claim any tax benefits. My understanding is you need a 3rd party to install the system, and it needs to be connected to the grid (not positive about that last point). I did the math and the money I saved by not paying a contractor ($20,000+) far exceeds the 30% rebate I'd get if I did.

That makes my blood boil. Is it illegal to let the sun hit my roof and turn to heat? Why should it be any different to convert it to electricity.  
Don't let a stupid law stop you. There must be a loophole. How about building the roofs of cars, trucks, trailers, etc out of solar material? Treat it as a material rather than a seperate technology added ontop of an existing structure. Or is the grid-tie that is illegal? Thats much easier to get around, especially once EVs become more common.

If I get a storm big enough to break the panels my house is probably leveled and I've got bigger problems. They are rated to 1" hail at ~50mph.  The inverter has a 5 year warranty (wish it was 25 like the panels). Anything else would be trivial to fix. Except the batteries but those get so much better/cheaper per year I'd almost welcome a chance to play with the newest tech.

Are you unable to do basic math? I make $1680/year in electricity. Unless I paid $42,000 for the system (hint, I didn't) the electricity cost over 25 years is much less than paying grid. That assumes that grid prices never go up and my panels only produce for the warrantied lifespan.

I'll let you know in 29 years :)  I'm sure my inverter will need to be replaced before 30 years is up, and I might loose a panel or two to rocks spit out by the mower or a bad hailstorm, but in general the panels are the most reliable electrical component you can buy.
It's going to take quite a few years before the system pays back it's upfront costs, but from there on I'm way ahead of the game.  It's only going to get cheaper and grid more expensive.

I've collected 6 out of 6 tips given in my solar panels bought with bitcoin thread. Does that count?
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:01:23
It does provide some power, but not much. It's sort of a carry-over from when it had a 12v battery onboard for the lights/usb charging port.  Now it feeds the 48v battery but it's only 20 watts.  The traction pack is 8kwh so you'd need 400 hours of sun to fully charge it. 
The tractor is a wheelhorse from the 60's-ish. 3 speed transmission plus a high-low range. It will move a full-size vehicle no problem.  It used to pull around a 1500pound trailer with a solar roof filled with tools. Chop saw, compressor, welder, plasma cutter, etc. Now the tools are in the garage and the dogs live in the solar trailer/solar doghouse.

In fact my entire system is designed to skirt the rules. My panels are non-permanently installed on movable skids. They can be pulled with my electric garden tractor or even a single person.
All my electrical connections are quick-disconnects. The equipment is installed in a metal cabinet on wheels. Nothing is hard mounted, nothing is hard wired. And of course the batteries allow me to store power and use it later rather than backfeed the grid with my excess.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:53:24
That depends on the mining setup. If electricity is less than the value of the bitcoins produced then mining is better than selling to the grid. I have old avalon ASICs that cost $56/mo to run but produce $9/mo in bitcoin so they've been sitting unused. Selling to the grid requires a purchase agreement, inspection, etc but mining does not.

Very cool. Not using an inverter makes lots of sense. Saves tons of money, eliminates a central point of failure, and reduces losses going from DC to AC and then back to DC. If I didn't need an inverter I could have 2x the solar panels!

What do you think of decentralizing those turbines into residential scale CHP systems? The efficiency would be lower but the heat is no longer wasted. So combined efficiency approaches 100%. And the grid goes from carrying 100% of load to carrying just the excess production from one neighbor to the next.

Solar pals!  Nothing wrong with grid-tie, it's probably the way to go for 95% of people right now. But I like playing with electricity and I've got lots of 48v battery vehicles (mower, tractor, wood chipper, etc) that I wanted to be able to charge right off the panels. No need to go DC -&gt; AC -&gt; DC conversion for this guy.
The future certainly is awesome. I haven't bought gasoline in at least a year now and I haven't given anything up. My mower has more power. My car is faster.  I can use the wood chipper without throwing my back out just to start the damn thing.

At this point, when talking usable capacity, lead/lithium cost around the same amount. But lithium last ~3,000 cycles and take up a much smaller amount of space.

Having people constantly tell me that NY doesn't get enough sun and winter would ruin my plan motivated me to try it. I'm actually really surprised how much power the panels yield on overcast days.

Certainly a good point. Undoubtedly some of this is just money being transferred around, sure. But whats the point of that? And only 10 blocks are generated every hour, so "mining" shouldn't account for more than $10,000BTC/day in "false" volume, assuming 1 swap after generation.  At this point in the game the amount transferred in and out of other currency probably says alot more, like you say.

The logical thing to do is buy a cruise ship and park it in international waters. Use it as a base of operations for constructing additional floating islands made of foamed concrete, or calcium structures precipitated out of seawater  onto a metallic backbone with electricity. 
It could serve as a floating entrepreneurial incubator. Genetics, drugs, gambling, bio-engineering could be among the logical pursuits for such an organization. 
Harvesting precious materials from seawater could also be a very lucrative endeavor. Heavy water, tritium, platinum, even salt is valuable. 
Floating solar panels / wave energy harvesting coupled with unlimited water cooling might make it a great place to locate servers.
Solar/wind powered drones could reduce the cost of transport to/from the floating colony enough that it's cheaper than trucking materials around on land.

I become obsessed with the concept of seasteading for one magical summer.  I learned an incredible amount, the topic is vast.  You need a good grasp of ecosystems/food-chain stuff, hydroponics, alternative energy, alternative construction techniques (thin-shell ferro-cement is probably the key here), law, international policy, "flags of convenience".  This was before bitcoin, mind you, and it fits in perfectly.  Don't forget to create an early warning perimeter of autonomous networked bouys and drones for things like "freak waves" and hostile vessels.  You'll want an "escape pod" capable of riding out a tsunami.

I was building servers and hosting them in my bedroom closet.  If I can have money why can I not spend it?  And if I can spend it, why not be allowed to receive?  
The lack of arbitrary age limits on accounts will undoubtedly be a positive feature to thousands.  Teens are online, have money, but can't spend money online.  Not anymore.

Of course they exist.  But most are probably fractional blocks generated by miners on pools.  I could see paying a small premium for coins mined with renewable energy, it's like a voluntary carbon tax but better, you're paying a little more to not produce carbon.

Where do you get this stuff from?  The hash rate of the network is completely necessary, it's what prevents a malicious entity from forking the blockchain.  And a pool in no way harms bitcoin unless they start attempting double spends, if anything it allows a much greater number of individuals to contribute computational resources to the network by reducing variance and the bandwidth/disk requirements.

I'm talking more about large artificial "islands" than I am boats, but I did realize that right after I posted I should have said composites rather than specifying ferro-cement. Still, if you were building an island it would likely be based on cement then fiberglass due to cost constraints.
I guess if you want to ride out the freak wave on a lifeboat that's up to you.  For a multi-hundred meter wide structure it would be a problem worth building a specific craft for.  We seem to be thinking on different scales.  
And the fact that alternative energy is a "given" on such crafts; awesome.  You guys get it, because you just have what nature gives you to work with, plus whatever you packed.  Aquaponics is an advanced form of hydroponics, but is certainly the way to go long-term.

If it's not profitable then miners will turn off, the difficulty will drop, and profitability will go up.  It's always in equilibrium.  Plus there are fees for priority, miners get those even when the block reward goes to zero in a hundred years.
