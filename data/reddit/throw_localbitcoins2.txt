OP here. Actually I was willing to pay the full price of my stupidity in the first place. My family and friends talked me into not doing that, because then the investigation would be closed without hurting the criminal. If I ever get to see some legal paper work showing that there is no other way the innocent guy is getting back his money, I'll pay at least half.

OP here (lost my password for throw_localbitcoins account)
I just saw a lawyer. According to him I already won the case. But it's going to cost me some serious money in lawyer's fees...
He also told me I can disclose the info that the police already knows.
So here we go. I'm in Brisbane, Australia.
The reason the police froze my account and not the criminal's account is that they wanted to know where the money was going.

Hi! Did though. Bye.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:43:14
OP here. The police would not have attacked me. But I wanted and still want to help the police get the criminal, so I'm fully cooperating.
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:43:33
OP here. I'm afraid to say too much, but it's a well developped country, with very low crime. I've never heard of the police doing any harm in my country.

OP here. That was a national deposit. You were wiser than me. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:13:27
OP here. I'm not asking for legal advice. Just giving a warning.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:39:36
OP here. I'm not under any legal binding to keep the secret. They just told me "Don't talk about this..." and I'm cooperating.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:32:38
Not pitch a new deal, but revise the terms of the contract I already have.
(OP here.)

OP here. I'm in Australia.
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:21:25


OP here. Thank you! I just PMed you.
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:31:46
OP here. I had seen this video before.
I talked for 2 reasons:
* this is not the US. I never heard of the police hurting innocent people here.
* I want to help the investigation. I want the criminal to be arrested.
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:59:14
OK. Why?
(OP here.)
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:33:42
OP here. Exactly.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:41:19
OP here. I'm in Australia.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:17:27
OP here. Those were wire transfers, not cash transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:46:14
OP here. I seriously thought about this possibility too. The police is not telling me anything, so this is still a possibility.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:19:22
OP here. A campaign against localbitcoins would benefit a competitor. But any competitor suffers from the same issue. So that would make no sense.
OK, that could benefit large exchanges like MtGox, but the share of localbitcoins is insignificant compared to MtGox's share.
I'm in Australia. I thought that would be a dead giveaway but there are much more localbitcoiners in Australia than I thought.

OP here. Maybe I mistranslated. By full body search I meant they went through my pockets and patted me. I agreed to anything because I want to help the police get the criminal.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:16:04
OP here. Most of these info I don't have because the police doesn't know or won't tell me. The buyer was using his own account as far as I know.

OP here. Thank you but I lost the password for throw_localbitcoins...
Anyway, you're my doge!
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:49:05
Sorry, no, see other post. (OP here)
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:35:10
How can I argue with that?
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:07:17
OK, my story is not verifiable. But I didn't make any extraordinary claim.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:52:33
OP here. I'm guessing they needed more paperwork to arrest me at my house. I don't know though.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:36:35
OP here. Maybe I mistranslated. By full body search I meant they went through my pockets and patted me. Not strip searched.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:27:50
No sorry. What country are you doing trade in?
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:00:28
OP here. Sure, but I'm going to spend the first hour explaining how bitcoin and localbitcoins work. Lawyers are paid hourly right?
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:56:33
You are insulting people you don't know based on a mere hunch that the story is bullshit. I have yet to give a fact that is provably impossible or inconsistent with another of my dozens posts.
Plus nobody gave a viable motive for bullshitting. FUD against peer-to-peer BTC exchange? Who does that profit?
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:45:26
I am OP. I lost my throwaway account password...
Half of the commenters here are telling me to lawyer up. You convinced me. I will see a lawyer tomorrow.
Also, many are telling me that I shouldn't have agreed to being questioned. I understand that, and I had seen the [very convincing talk]( before the facts. But on the other hand, I want to help the police get the criminal. Actually I am the one who volunteered my phone for them to get the emails. I understand that that may get me in more trouble, but I estimate that the risk is quite low, and I guess I'm willing to take this risk for a good chance to get the crook.
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:11:11
OP here. I volunteered my phone with my emails. I want to help the investigation even if there is a small risk that will get used against me.
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:11:16
OP here. I thought in person cash transactions were a bit unsafe... I never imagined wire transfers were more unsafe.
