great point. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:36:07
We mentioned yesterday, "It is very likely that we are going to see a "backtest" of support which is now broken (yellow trendline at $6300)."  There you have it folks, we have seen the backtest and working like clockwork. We also mentioned yesterday, that "A move above $6300 will mean that the black trendline will be tested at $6450. There will be selling pressure at that level." We still expect selling pressure at that level. What could be setting up here is a inverted bullish head &amp; shoulders pattern. We have shown you the neckline of that pattern below and we have depicted it with a graphic. We will keep you posted.

It is very likely that we are going to see a "backtest" of support which is now broken (yellow trendline at $6300). Either way, the trend is decidedly down and any rally should be a chance to reduce exposure.  A move above $6300 will mean that the black trendline will be tested at $6450. There will be selling pressure at that level. As BTCUSD falls, tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are expected to bleed out further, deleting their temporary gains throughout early September.

Sorry should’ve mentioned it

WE are all Satoshi Nakamoto.

I guess it’ll all depend on the price of BTC at the time :)

We wrote an article based on this post. Check it out: [

Not a meme. USDC available on Coinbase as of today!!! 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:55:05
According to Coinbase, they decided to list a Stablecoin because “The advantage of a blockchain-based digital dollar like USDC is easier to program with, to send quickly, to use in dApps, and to store locally than traditional bank account-based dollars. That’s why we think of it as an important step towards a more open financial system.”

Why is the federal reserve hiking rates then? Btw this is not a meme. It’s a chart from the Federal reserve. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:14:46
Of course it is. It is the year in which the network will have to solely rely on transaction fees!!! 
@_date: 2018-10-31 06:51:06
End the Fed!!!!

There are definitely much harder color combos out there lol ��
@_date: 2018-10-29 14:22:23
Not really... because the article is referring to the long term. What we are seeing now is just sideways trading. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:58:30
I appreciate that Yellen had the courtesy to reply... considering the fact that she has been a Bitcoin critic for years!

@_date: 2018-10-29 11:46:41
Good answer, but what do you think the price will be in terms of fiat currency? 
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:14:23

I hope to accumulate well over 0.21 btc!!!

It was only a temporary block haha. They thought his account was hacked ��

Satoshi Nakamoto would be proud!

Geez thanks to whoever gave me a gold award. Just got upgraded to Reddit premium for a week and got 100 coins. What can I do with these perks? ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:48:21
You don’t lose until you sell. Just HODL. In a couple of years $13.3k will look like an amazing entry!

Bitcoin Suisse gonna overtake Credit Suisse in the future. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 11:29:10
They’ll just print more.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think he’s just got a low time preference. He’d rather hoard onto his Bitcoin for future spending because he anticipates that it will increase in purchasing power over time!
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:22:44
Buy at support and sell at resistance with strict stop losses ? 
@_date: 2018-11-12 07:42:59
Man's stuck at 6400 price level
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:29:23
You can’t use TA alone. Fundamentals is what’s most important. But you can use TA to help you manage risk.. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:40:37
Not only a currency but the best store of value. Bitcoin will replace the US Dollar as the world’s reserve currency within the next 30 years. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:59:34
I definitely am! 
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:59:09
Couple of things: 1) best not to enter the market until there’s a clear breakout or breakdown. 
2) if you would like to swing trade then enter at the right levels so the risk reward makes sense. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:05:18
Try explaining that to people who bought at $20k. 
I agree with you on having a low time preference though — low time preference requires patience, and control of your emotions  :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:05:06
The people who waited for $1700 btc were simply unrealistic. The best strategy is to accumulate btc over a long period of time irrespective of price. That way you will not be affected by these price fluctuations! 
The message I wanted to put out was to people who are watching the price skyrocketing now and who feel like they need to invest immediately because they’re missing out. Investing based on your emotions will get you 
EDIT, 
Some of you seem to be misunderstanding my message so here’s a clarification: 
I think a lot of people are feeling left out during this run up. So my advice to those people is pretty straight forward: you shouldn’t buy based on your emotions or the fear of missing out. Have a clear strategy so that price fluctuations don’t affect your decision making. Have a weekly/monthly buying strategy to average out your entry price. Do this for a decade. And you will have the last laugh :)

Snoop Dogg’s brother from another mother.
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:06:57
How do you do that?
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:08:38
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:32:35
BTC only moves within a few days, with a high velocity. Most of the year it trades sideways! On average btc has seen most gains on 13 days out of 365 years. So  isn’t a bad strategy afterall.

Cheers mate!
