Bitcoin days destroyed isn't just volume, it's an indication that "old money" is leaving the system since older coins have more of an impact. An increase in days destroyed is usually considered stronger hands since it is people who have been around for a while. - It seems like the article postulates the opposite without any explanation.

Isn't the groupon business model broken?

There's a clear dop off in market share after the Dwolla account seizure. If Mt. Gox cannot continue to process USD withdrawals, there will no doubt be a massive shift in volume to an exchange that will suppport it.

They mentioned that was on their list... even without that I like this better than the other sites I've been using. These guys do some solid analysis so I have a lot of faith in where this is going.

They must be finding shares a lot faster than that... no idea what the flash is though.

I created a new post for you:

To perform a 51% attack, they'd need to have more than the rest of the network combined... over 100 Th/s

People could just not use the software... There's nothing forcing people to update to a corrupted version. We could fork the software and use a legitimate version. Obviously there would be short term damage to bitcoins reputation, however the protocol itself could remain largely unaffected.
Edit: addressing the secon question you added after I posted this:
The potential consequence of not having a proper business model is jail time or large fines .... I think people would prefer to take a little longer and straighten out the situation before it comes to that.

You have to add their hasing power to the current power. So if they create 60 TH/s to attack a network of 100 TH/s, they would have 60 / 160 = 37%

Ha, I just saw a Mt Gox wager on Pridictious ... You can bet that Mt. Gox is not operating on July 31st.
Has anyone used that site before?

Open-transactions still has counter-party risk which bitcoin doesn't.
Those currencies use an IOU-debt system, instead of bitcoin's asset system. The contracts in open-transactions are issued by people holding the underlying assets. This debt is only as good as the entity issuing it, so you still need to trust that that debt is backed and reliable. Bitcoin assets are at this stage unquestionable.
