While 2FA is the parent category for the the security method, the way the codes are delivered varies. HOTP and TOTP are much harder to compromise than SMS. Even harder if you secure your token generator. Example, you want to access my bittrex account, so you need physical access to my phone. but my phone is encrypted, so you need my password to access it, then you need the pin for my authenticator app. Then, because I'm paranoid, you need to figure out which of the 32 TOTP accounts is the one for bittrex (I have a method of obfuscating the accounts).
If I use sms, you only need to know my number and carrier, and a few personal details, enough to social engineer an account transfer... 
While sms is better than nothing, the same rule for Bitcoin goes for 2FA, "if you don't control the keys, you don't own the coins" - "if you don't control the keys for the 2FA, you only think youre safe"

The mempool contains 250,000k or so in transaction feea because of the back log and congestion. It wouldnt be that high if there was less congestion. Theoretically, fees would be lower and the back log would be eliminated.

@_date: 2017-03-31 04:32:10
A full node is only capable of validating the rules for the chain it is on. They don't decide the rules, they enforce them. If the miners all fork off the BU, the full nodes in existence will just ignore their blocks, because they don't validate. So they will be on the old chain still... Let's see how long that lasts when they lose their mining power...

I get what you're saying, but you're missing the point.
My credit card comes with a $15 a month fee. That means 60 transactions a month at 0.25c is the equivalent. My wife and I combined make 100 transactions a month. So $25. That's less than the $30 a month just having a credit card costs. So as I said the 25c a transaction, which is actually much more than I usually pay - more likely 7C - is very reasonable.
And I am willing to pay that so that miners can maintain the network so that people like my friends and family can use the network without needing to run a node.
@_date: 2016-11-10 13:34:35

What benefit does having the one key on both provide? The more devices with your key on them, the wider the attack vector. Spreading them over separate vendors means increased likelihood of a software flaw being exploited.
If youre suggesting a different store on each device, that makes more sense, but adds a level of complexity that may out weigh the benefits.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:47:57
Oh my gosh you are one dense mofo! Their costs are different. They make their profit a different way. They may have to bundle the tax into the sale price, or there may be fees once you're trading over a certain volume. Who knows. The point is, there are many factors that differ between the USA and China, thus they have different fee structures.
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:17:06
I can afford 0.25c a transaction. I can afford $100 a month for internet. While I am lucky to live in an area with fibre internet that gets me 25-100 Mbps most of my friends and family are stuck with ADSL2+ that caps out at 16 mbps. It's not always a case of cost, some times it's availability.

Okay, I'll bite. 
The law makers can legislate as much as they like. They can round up all the people involved in Bitcoin and try to prevent it from being used.  But that won't stop it. They could arrest all the developers world wide, but there are countries that would oppose the US taking their citizens like that. Russia, China, and more. Further, it would drive the community underground, where it would thrive all the more.
Exchanges and gateways could be taken offline, but new ones will pop up. Look at the efforts made by RIAA etc to stop piracy. Think of that as a small scale example. There is more money on both sides in crypto, but it will end the same.
While they could attack Bitcoin by investing trillions in mining equipment and performing a "51% attack", it wouldn't stop every coin. With currencies that can't be mined with ASIC devices, home users could contribute to fight that (or even with Bitcoin, grab an R1 and use that) with their CPU and Graphics card. PoS coins would be harder to topple too. And even if they destroy 90% of the coins out there (let's be honest, that would be kinda good for the remaining 10%), each coin they destroyed would resume once the attack ended, just rolling back to the blocks before the attacks started, and resuming in a HF.
Now, let's flip it, what tinfoil hat theory do you have as to how they can actually stop this?

Every countermeasure for these unwanted transactions has a counterpart within an email spam filtering system. 
Filtering based on perceived value, blacklisting based on origin, content filtering... They are all spam fighting techniques. 
Next you'll tell me that there is even a system that allows you to look in to the headers of the transactions and filter them based on values found there... 
But you'll still deny that spam even exists

Push an agenda, I can agree to. But spam is merely unwanted transactions/message/noise that waste your time/effort (CPU cycles and storage space) filtering out. Signal to noise ratio etc. And if I create a node, set it to listen and record the IP address of all the other nodes it connects with, I can spam the entire network with out your node doing any relaying for me, and I can share that list of nodes amongst many light nodes, and piss off the whole network with these spam messages. Is this starting to sound like the way spammers collect email addresses online, then infect other computers to send email on their behalf?

Other than the fact that its nothing like mining, because faucets are places people who want to encourage bitcoin adoption donate coins so that newbies can receive them and learn about wallets and transactions without wasting their own money. Faucets basically allow for a try before you buy of bitcoin. If you build this script and run it, youre ripping off the community, setting back the adoption of bitcoin, and adding to the negative image it already has with the general public. Don't be a dick...

You made the statement that there is no such thing as transaction spam. Then pointed out how you would use (email) spam filtering techniques to unburden your node from unwanted transactions.
The case I am trying to make is that unwanted transactions are spam, no matter what you want to call them. The emails I get in my inbox selling me the latest greatest bullshit I never want to see from people I don't know are still legitimate email messages. They have headers, body content, they are sent over SMTP. But they are still spam. The same is true for transactions on the blockchain.

The world is a vastly different place now. Obama is out of terms and both candidates to replace him are terrible choices, the UK is leaving the EU, China is going through economic turmoil, and nations around the world are going to shit, meanwhile companies like Apple are reporting lower earnings than expected. Technology is improving, and becoming cheaper... all of these things point to even better odds for bitcoin at the moment, but then when you look at the altcoin markets, you see more money moving out of btc into them because people are concerned about the transaction times and blocksize. Whether these concerns are founded or not, the fact that the two major bitcoin forums on reddit talk about little else means the bad news is all people get to see... that is not beneficial from the price of bitcoin at all...

While I agree with you, there is a difference between uber and Bitcoin in terms of surge pricing. Uber does it as a percentage. 10% hike over $100 is $1. Bitcoin does it as a flat fee - charging you $3 to send from a -&gt; b, whether it's 50c or $50,000.
While this is great for the $50,000 it's shit for the 50c
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:08:31
The trigger is identical, the mechanism is not.
Uber uses percentage for surge pricing, Bitcoin uses competitive bartering ... If uber started offering priority to the person offering the highest tip, then it would be the same...

Exchanges should charge higher than default fees for at least two reasons:
1. Reducing "I sent $20 worth of bitcoin to my Nanna 20 minutes ago and she hasn't got it yet" support tickets - this means their support staff get to deal with real issues and they don't have to hire new support staff to deal with impatience.
2. Offsetting rapid changes in fees. While the fees are low now, if we get another backlog build up rapidly, those fees could go up too fast for a fee-average-over-the-last-week calculation to adjust. If the fees charged by the exchange are reasonably high enough now, they won't get caught in a surge. Also, they could - and should - be skimming a % of these higher than default fees and putting it aside to offset lower than default fees in case of a surge...
