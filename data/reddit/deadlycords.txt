this is could something ... the date 2002/08/01 is relevant for this paper: [
The reason I think that either this paper, or the date is important is a massive stretch, but the name of the image file is g4rbvtbiwry01.PNG \- g4rbvtbiwry01 is 12 letters \(if we count 01 as one letter\), which could correlate to a series of seed words.
If i take the most common bip39 seed words in the whitepaper starting with each letter, there is only one word starting with the letter 'y', which is year.
Also, the 01 in the img name correlates to the date of this paper. Almost definitely a coincidence, but could be somewhere near the solution.
**A completely different approach I have been trying:**
I've also been trying to brute force the 12 seed words by using all the words starting with g, a \(which looks like a 4\) or all the words near the 4 in the image, r, b, v, t, b, i , w, r, y, and all the words near the 01 in the image, but I suck at programming so don't know how to do that haha.

The following 21 word sequence is a valid seed, but not the right seed - might be helpful + it uses almost all of the clues
code easily attack early agree online post sign pool risk cash gap old law almost open one coin modify course try

your last point \-\- exactly this, everyone thinks the angles have something to do with it \- it's just autogenerated between \-60 and 60, like most wordart websites
1\) What is the string?
2\) name of the png is  g4rbvtbiwry01 \-\&gt; this gives 10 letters and 3 numbers. I have tried nearly all combinations of bip39 words in the whitepaper that start with those letters, assuming 4 is A \- as well as words near the '01' in the image, which gives 12 words total.
3\) Seems like random words \- e.g. John and Wei or Dai, seems super weird.
One thing i've starting thinking about is maybe 'think in pairs' refers to major BTC pairings like USD or ETH... but could be completely off track.

just latching on to this comment for visibility. So far I have found a six\- word seed that works on [ which uses the most common words from the whitepaper:
**network one coin next verify still**
if someone wants to try brute force using this combo, good luck, remember me when you solve it :P \- I have tried lots of other combinations of the top 12\-24 words without success.

trying to think of 'pairs'... online was at the intersection of lost and almost/users... post is near attack, code and early (i also tried 'find').
modify was someone else's suggestion and it paired well with 'try'.
then i just tried a bunch of different orders, keeping the first four words together, 'one coin' together, and 'try' toward the end
I was pretty surprised when the 21 word sequence worked, but the wallet it revealed is empty

Another thing i've noticed, if we use the font 'worksans' holding 'ALT' and typing 00212121 gives '™'
Doing this for 20020801 gives 'A'
Doing this for \+1 gives the **notdef** glyph \-\-\&gt; this is the most interesting finding, as with other fonts it gives ☺ as an output
May be irrelevant, but could verify the 256\+1 idea
