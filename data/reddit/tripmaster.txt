This is pure Chinese capital flight.  BTC is one of the few investment vehicles available to RMB-locked value; CCP has clamped restrictions on most viable diversification options for retail.
It will most likely continue if the RMB continues its rapid slide.

It's equal parts good/bad IMO.  
**Irrational optimism** favors the headline of |Cryptos being "bigger than government"| emerging from this episode.  
**Metered optimism** favors a "passing of the torch" from an unpredictable, irrational actor to more rational, stable actors.
**Irrational Pessimism** favors inevitable, dramatic market corrections that will happen over the coming weeks. This is NOT a time to buy!
**Metered Pessimism** favors market corrections that, while painful, will settle crypto prices out of the current short-term bubble.  This is NOT a time to buy; however, it's wait and watch until China is fully OUT of the crypto markets.

BTCChina is under pressure and has read the tea leaves (or has had the tea leaves read to them behind closed doors).  Lest we forget   BTCChina was spared the public face-loss, they clearly have a different relationship with the PBoC than OKCoin or Houbi.  These two are gonna drop next.
