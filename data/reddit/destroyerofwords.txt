The best part of the article is this:


No shit?  People cared more about a sudden 50% drop in value than a 6% drop?  Wow.

Ah, OK, so anyone at all can tell it's a fork because the reward amount is wrong.
Thank you, that really clears things up.
So it doesn't require any specific amount of computing power to change the reward, but it does require that users download a different client that uses the new blockchain?  This means that it essentially requires a large portion of nodes (who don't get any reward themselves) to change the reward amount?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:23:11
Obviously.  But where is the dividing line?
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:17:45
I'm not disputing that savers *can* make money in an inflationary system.  
I'm disputing that "deflation is bad for everyone". Didn't we already agree that deflation is good for savers?  Good for someone =&gt; not "bad for everyone"!
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:43:49
If inflation = decrease in price of currency, then inflation is always bad for the consumer no matter how quickly they spend.  Why would any economist argue for inflation?
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:32:25
Finally, thank you!

Can we have a discussion of what events are possibly causing this?
My vote is on the fact that if the US government doesn't reopen by Thursday, then the value of the dollar will drop relative to BTC due to the government defaulting on some debts.  So BTC is reacting to the expectation of a drastic rise later in the week.
I don't really understand what's going to happen on Thursday if the government doesn't reopen, but I think it's pretty clearcut for most people that it's bad for the dollar.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:45:14
You're going to have to explain why you think a deflationary currency is never spent and always eventually collapses.
For one, if the value of the currency was sure to go down, wouldn't people spend it?

Do you know where it is in Allentown?  I visit Allentown about once a week and I want to check it out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:52:19
Got it.  So it's just as hard as making an altcoin.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:59:55
I can't read the 2nd page, so can someone explain to me the claim of making an objective valuation without actually measuring the supply and demand of a representative sample of the population?
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:55:22
Forget estimating the transaction fee.  Just link to something like this: 
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:07:15
Right. Savers are not making rational, informed decisions and therefore are not part of the "Economic standpoint". Got it.

If there were an actual analog version of bitcoin mining, we could make a very secure blockchain from it.
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:37:54
What's that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:22:28
No, this is obviously false.  Something is causing miners and nodes to accept the new coins that are created.  Otherwise, we'd have been stuck at 0.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:52:17
that's it!

If you send it to me, I'll give you 2:3 odds of tripling your money.
Seriously, gambling with your money the moment you get it is a really bad habit.  You should stop that.

Eventually, it'll stabilize once the efficient market hypothesis is again satisfied.  For now, no one knows what the price will do.

I like it.  Very Luis von Ahn
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:09:20
I was about to write about this myself actually.
I had a better idea though.  We can also pool together the resources of a large portion of the world's computing power by ensuring that anyone who works on the problem gets paid.  That way, it's actually feasible to break into the troves in the near future.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:29:11
Do you have 100s or more?  How has daytrading been working out for you?
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:58:36
Then let the currency war begin!
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:56:42
Right.  And what % of miners &amp; nodes does this require?
If miners and nodes supported different block rewards, what percent agreement would be required for the reward to be determined?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:57:57
51% of what?  How does this work?
@_date: 2013-10-21 00:56:13
Samuel certainly spoke against governments.  Not all the scriptures speak the same message.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:19:01
OK... So they create a hard fork that honors old transactions and everyone stops using the old version.  Now there's more than 21 million BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:24:13
Glad to see that this is coming up in conversation without me being the first to mention it for once!

No, the QR code is a Subway-wide promotion.  He used an android wallet app and he had me scan a QR code.

lol.  That's 1/4 the price of the sandwich.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:16:07
Your very first sentence.


You said that deflation is bad for everyone.  Then you said


So you're saying "savers'" money is not "economic", which you previously defined as "people making rational and informed decisions".  So unless you're backing out of your previous definition of "economic", you're saying that savers are not making rational informed decisions by putting their money where they put it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:56:05
We never meant to stay here.  We were just here for the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:46:03
There are reasons I investigate altcoins and have bought a few.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:02:02
It's good for savers.  So it's not bad for everyone.
I don't know what "economic standpoint" means.  Sounds like you're making up new individuals that don't actually exist.  Which individuals is deflation bad for?  I've already given you an example of people that deflation is good for, so why is it bad "economically"?
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:17:57
Ok. So let's assume 51% of nodes do this.
This would then make bitcoin inflate past 21 million BTC?  Sure, it would no longer be "bitcoin" as envisioned by Satoshi, but I don't see what that matters.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:34:29
You're going to have to tell us what those words are so we can check.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:20:44
OK Sure.  But I was just asking what's needed to inflate Bitcoin, not if it would actually be feasible.
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:02:49
For the current alt-coins that are essentially bitcoin clones?  None.  They're all irrelevant.
The future of alt-coins is only in adding new features that won't be implemented in bitcoin or in making distributed services like Namecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:20:57
Impossible.  Bitcoin can never go to Mars due to the speed of light delay involved with such a distance.

Well, sure if bitcoin is just a major player in the currency wars and not the 1 world currency, it complicates things.
But more importantly -- Why do you expect a flat distribution of bitcoin?  0.003 bitcoins only doesn't make you rich if the distribution of bitcoins is ridiculously flat.
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:12:49
my suspicion is that the suspected events coming on Thursday are playing a role.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:24:43
If you want to buy bitcoin in Allentown, go to localbitcoins.com and look for "pinkmist".  Send him a text message and tell him you want to buy. The guy is legit.

I agree that this is what most people do, but you're all doing it wrong.  Why?  Short version -- if Bitcoin succeeds, holding 3 mBTC or more will make a man rich as shit, but if you play the hype, you'll lose money pretty consistently.
Most people won't "cash out of the hype" until it's too late.  People who are playing the hype see a huge price rise/drop and then they buy/sell thinking "This is it!  It's going to be huge/it's failing!"  People who play on hype are always losers except in the rare case when it really does rise/drop like a rocket/stone (which only happens for big reasons that are widely publicized).
Since people who play hype are often losers, they'll learn their lesson pretty quickly.  The fact is this -- there will only ever be 21 million BTC, and there are over 7 billion people and growing.  This means that if you own 3 mBTC and BTC becomes a major world currency, then you're guaranteed to have more BTC than 50% of people in the worst case scenario of a completely flat distribution.
This is really simple math, and easy enough for even the dullest people to grasp:  If you have even 0.003 BTC and hold, and BTC succeeds, you'll be filthy rich.  If you play the hype, try to get $s, lose consistently, you'll end up poor.
The only reason you should play the hype is if you think BTC will lose in the long run and that &gt;3 mBTC you have isn't likely to get you rich in the long run.
I got burned badly by playing the hype and made a 10BTC mistake during the April bubble.  It only takes 1 huge mistake for a person to learn to play long term rather than short term.
My advice -- only play the short term if you think you know something everyone else in the market doesn't.  Protip: Everyone in the market knows the current price.  You're stupid as fuck to play on the price.
If you play long term, and you think Bitcoin will succeed, then **there is 0 reason to sell *ever***.  If Bitcoin succeeds, you'll be able to buy actual goods with them.  You'll never have a reason to hold those $s you risked so much to get.
The only reason for long term holders to sell cryptocurrencies for $s is news of a catastrophic failure in Bitcoin that hurts its long term prospects.

According to the owner Sapal, I was customer   He made a new receiving address so that his income wouldn't be mixed with his donations to the Foundation.
The Subway is at 3337 Hamilton Blvd in Allentown, PA.
I'll go back for lunch tomorrow, so if anyone has a question for Sapal, I'll be sure to ask him if he's there.

But the majority of economists argue for inflation, not slight deflation or even 0% change in price.  Why?  It seems to me that slight deflation is better for consumers and worse for debtors.

hey that's better than my job

Are you sure about that?  I don't have the historical knowledge myself.
Were they a single court that made decisions together?  Or were they mostly independently acting?

No. You get a coupon if you complete an online survey.  Completely unrelated.

He was on the phone, so we didn't talk much.  I'll ask him any questions when I eat there again tomorrow.
He did say that he's "a big fan" of bitcoin and he was excited to be accepting it.  Plus, free cookie for anyone who pays in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:53:09
If he's there tomorrow, I'll interview him.  So you can relay me any questions you have.  Also, I have the phone number. I'll PM it to you.

Agreed, but I don't think I'd trust Blizzard with my items after I bought them with bitcoin.  I'd want my data secured on a blockchain too.
Actually... do you know anything about designing a filesystem ?  I want to build an altcoin specifically for MMOs.

In a time of anarchy for the Jews, some people wanted a king.  The prophet Samuel spoke to the Jews about the evils of government and told them to stay in anarchy.  His wishes were not respected.  Samuel said that the king would take at least 10% of each product produced and he'd take all the best people to do his bidding.  I think Samuel was terribly optimistic.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:48:56
Clearly... the answer is to have 1 inflationary currency and 1 deflationary currency.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:28:46
I expect 90% of people who buy bitcoins to trade them back for $s at a loss because they think they think daytrading is profitable and they still believe in the $ more than BTC.  Very few people will have even 1 mBTC by the time bitcoin becomes mainstream.
