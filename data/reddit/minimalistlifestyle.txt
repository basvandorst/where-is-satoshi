What literal corner should I look around?
Ugh, learn what “literally” means please!!! Sorry, pet peeve of mine. I accept the literal downvotes.

You don’t need bitcoin for that. You can buy it with KNOWLEDGE!

This. Further, if you have a significant amount, talk to a tax consultant beforehand. There are ways of limiting your capital gains taxes and talking to someone could save you a ton of money.

Looks like I’m changing banks!

Coinbase is legit, your money is somewhere. Contact support in the morning and don’t lose sleep over this. It’s fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:26:14
Stop buying in large chunks. Just buy a little bit each month and look at the price in about 5 years.

I admit I was hodling my breath a little bit today haha. Having a glass of scotch.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:28:09
Sooooooo..... hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:44:11
You mean they misspelled hodl? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:56:27
I'll cash out when it hits about $250k, and no I'm not kidding!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:37:57
Haha, yes I know. But so is CNN and MSNBC and....
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:09:11
This has always been my "lottery ticket" investment. I know it's high risk, and I'll either go down with the ship or ride it out until I can retire on my Bitcoin earnings. Of course, the ultimate plan is that it gets to be such a legitimate form of currency I wouldn't ever have to cash it out for dollars, but theoretically, if it hits $250k in the next 10 years I could easliy retire. I'd wait and cash it all out at once.

What does “holding” mean? Is that like an acronym or something?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:15:54
Holy shit though, I never even thought of these angles! This would disrupt just about every service app from meal delivery to uber to dog sitter apps to parking apps, etc.

USD is backed by the fact I can walk down to the local Mexican joint and buy a burrito with a $5 bill.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:27:22
Because nobody knows if this is a bubble or revolution. My 7.5 Bitcoin are either coming with me to retirement or sinking to the Ocean floor. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:09:11
1. Bitcoin fails.
2. Bitcoin fails.
3. Bitcoin fails (except other cryptos do tend to follow general bitcoin trends, so a pass could be argued)
4. Bitcoin fails.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:23:12
I thought it was going to be "flying lambo!"
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:21:02
Yeah, but I made it say boobs, hehe.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:58:48
What happened? I was hoping Bitcoin would be near $10k by the end of the year. Are we no longer in target?!?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:25:33
I was always a long-term guy, too, but I would also always dream of the day when Bitcoin was worth $1,000,000 and imagined myself cashing out and retiring. But then I read or heard someone say something to the effect of....
"If Bitcoin ever reaches $1,000,000 each, you won't want to cash it out."
It took me a while, but I now look forward to the day when I simply own 5 Bitcoin and that's why I'm set for life.

You just made me remember domain names back in the 90's. I had the opportunity to buy up some really great .com domain names, but at the time, I didn't realize the significance of the internet and that a single domain name could be sold for literally millions. Great opportunities are right in front of our faces all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:40:54
You’ll need more fuel units to deal with all that NAAAALIDGE!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:17:50
I'm officially scared. Is anyone else scared?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:19:35
YES WE CAN!
.......Or maybe the opposite.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:22:59
How much for one of those shower ticker things? I’ll take 2 of them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:12:45
It’s because people found out this sub is HEAVILY moderated and censored. I’ll probably get banned just for writing this.

Dude, there's over 15 million millionaires just in the United States and climbing very quickly. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:29:50
I don't know if I can HODL until 4126. I'm an impatient man.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:47:05
Define “downward spiral” haha! ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:33:57
Diversification. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:35:25
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:42:51
I love how none of these "experts" were around 2 years ago telling everyone to buy because they would get a 2,000% return on their investment. But we should all listen to them now that this is all a bubble, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:00:45
Join the club. I got in 18 months ago and purchased 5 bitcoin when it was at $620. I feel extremely fortunate for that, but nobody saw this shit coming. Even just 6 months ago, nobody would have predicted Bitcoin would be toying with $20k by the end of the year. But don't take my word for it, go look at old articles and Reddit posts. $20k wasn't even on anyone's radar. You're going back to when Bitcoin was a buck? You had no way of knowing. Absolutely no way.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:43:41
Being from San Diego I rather enjoyed that line haha
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:45:21
If we get a Kensington like solar flare event everyone is fucked, not just crypto hodlers. Might want to hodl some seeds just in case. Diversification!
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:16:49
Am I doing it right?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:27:20
6,5 all purchased below $5k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:20:04
You’ll be the one laughing once bitcoin hits $1,000,000,000 in a few weeks!
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:23:04
Werkin’ on it!
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:50:33
My first 3 bitcoin were purchased at $550 and I’ve hodled. Not that I’m bragging.
.....Ok fine I’m bragging.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:44:18
Best one I’ve seen so far haha!!!
