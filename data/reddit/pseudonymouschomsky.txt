ACH can not easily be reversed. any reversal requires special paperwork to be filled out with the ACH warehouse. The receiver or sender has to be notified. and the receivers or senders  bank can reject the request.

I had the same problem trying to deposit $20.00 via ACH. I contacted customer support and also received a standard "we will get back to you" message. 
I also tested the 'send to email' feature  which worked (they start your account with $10.00 of btc). 
And I tested the withdrawal feature for  ($1.01).  This feature didn't work too well. At first I tried denominating my withdrawal in bitcoins, and I received an error message that there were too many decimal in the request, which there were not. I then denominated it in US dollars, where $1.00 is the minimum amount you can withdraw. It then proceeded to turn my Firefox window black, locking up the browser. Windows has been crashing ever since. I am however still waiting for the confirmation/settlement from my bank in the event that Circle actually received the request on the backend.
Has anyone else had a similar experience? I am still waiting to hear back from them.

Pretty cool to see Bitcoin ATMs are now in malls. Increased access to bitcoin is now reaching into the physical domain where millions of average people everyday spend time and money.  With that in mind, and a huge new market for adopters/users, I'd like to ask the owner of the ATM (and the sign) who will have tens of thousands of customers trafficking past his sign, why you chose the predominant advertising message to everyone seeing the bitcoin logo to be "Buy and sell" ? 
A basic critique by average mall passers by, who know little about bitcoin might reveal that it sounds like you're directing people to a new kind of pawn shop that "buys and sells". You're basically saying we buy and sell digital gold (which is what YOU do, but not necessarily what's in it for the customer). Is buying and selling what everyone shopping in the mall should think, or is there another reason to go to the bitcoin ATM?
Isn't the context of your location about more customers spending more bitcoins and cash, shopping? Or is the context about investing and profit/loss? If the former, they are there to "get bitcoins and cash for bitcoins" so in practice they can transact with increasing numbers of merchants able to accept bitcoins (or with cash prefering merchants (not wanting high credit and debit fees)). 
If the latter, with "Buy and sell" as the message next to the beautiful bitcoin logo, why not also advertise your conversion fees into the design? Not enough space for that? Are your fees occasionally changing? Why not make this an LCD sign with a live feed of the updated fees and prices instead? That would get people's attention!
Also, who cares (other than you) that people are made aware you are directing them to an ATM owned by you, Zenbox? Is there another bitcoin ATM in the mall owned by a competitor, that customers should be made aware (on the sign) which operator they are being directed to?
TLDR: Sign should be replaced, say &lt;logo&gt;, "bitcoin", "Get bitcoins and cash for bitcoins", "ATM upstairs across from Jamba Juice".

I don't work for Gox, but I've run an exchange with customized software and treasury management for ACH. THEIR ACCOUNTING IS WRONG. Even with top coders, GOX has to bring in more accountants, outside auditors, and or top forensics - for recovery and for making beefed up practices and product to ascertain true balance. 
As of December Gox stated they had more than 1 million customers. There is a lot of accounting to be audited there. And to customers who were underpaid and overpaid bitcoin and fiat, it takes more than cooperation from all banks for imminent reversals (which have time constraints placed on transactions in error anyway).  
I can't really speak about their internal controls or management's best practices, or other tools they use to mesh with banks. But I can say this is not a simple software fix or about general speculation about liquidity... Even as the OP and other core devs have identified it as such. This is a matter of accounting for all accounts. Without this, a software patch won't fix the underlying mistakes.

Sad times to read the many opinions about whether Gox has peoples coins and cash. Other exchanges were also ddos.  Other exchanges halted transactions. People aren't complaining about other exchanges. That doesn't mean they don't also have forensic accounting challenges. That doesn't mean they have people's coins and cash either. I think the real story will be found in the accounting.  I think the real story will be found in discovery of accounts with mismatched TX ids who bought and sold.  So If Gox and others did their AML well, surely a trace to the users and their banks will expose the criminals that exploited malleability.  Whether those funds are recoverable and how much is another question. I just hope for the sake of all bitcoiners people come together to overcome the massive challenge in getting to the truth to help recover the funds.

First of all let me clarify, this is not a new tax. Income tax is not new. And yes, bitcoin processors should be considered payment processors. although you may be receiving bitcoin, you have elected to have that bitcoin converted to fiat.
IRS released a rule in the Tax Code, Section 6050W for payment processors in 2012. Since IRS had not provided sufficient time to allow companies to tackle the massive new administrative costs for implementation, IRS sent out another letter, effectively delaying 6050W for payment processors until 2013. 
From 2009 -2012, I ran an (non digital currency) exchange. The tax law firm who represented my company advised we collect W-9s for unincorporated individuals, whereas LLCS and other businesses were exempt under the code. The payment threshold was either 20k, or more than 200 payments received in a calendar year.
I am not sure the business practices for Coinbase, Bitpay, and others. However, I know if you are an unincorporated individual, they should have requested a W-9 at the time of signup with their service. Otherwise, if they do not, and if you exceed the threshold, they are required under the Code to submit any information they have about you to the IRS, and you will also receive a 1099-k from the payment processor. The 1099-k will show the amount they processed on your behalf.
BTW, Coinkite, another payment processor, is a Canadian based company.....

Though the core Ethereum protocol is funded through the ICO software sale, the original developers bootstrapped conceptualization.  There is also the Ethereum Foundation which provides grants up to 10k for DApp developers and has set aside funds for core development. 
It is orthogonal too that there are "investors" funding Blockstream to add sidechains functionality for added value to the bitcoin protocol and still ether ICO buyers who see "funding" (providing economic incentive) to developers for adding other functionalities to decentralized crypto.
Ultimately the subsidy comes from some economic incentive.

I was trying to evaluate Ledger TrustIet in the Android App store, to see if it supported my Galaxy S5 and then I read that Samsung has pushed the Galaxy S6 into the enterprise with Trustonic for Knox. 
So it seems the Galaxy S5 is not supported.  Going forward I will probably buy an s6, S7 or perhaps a Galaxy Tab S2. My hope is to use the Ledger Trustlet, continue to use my two Ledger nanos, but not purchase Ledger Blue.

@_date: 2015-11-17 02:52:56
As a bitcoiner since 2011, I find it really astounding how skeptical most folks in this thread approach Ethereum. I have also followed Ethereum since the whitepaper and just spent a full week at DevCon1. Sergio Lerner, among many others performed a security audit on only one of the 7 different code implementations of the Ethereum protocol, has clearly "borrowed" the licensed code. It therefore goes to say that if his implementation of the EVM works, and bitcoin miners can agree to a fork of the core bitcoin software (lol), they will all have to suffer performance of bitcoin blocktime discovery and therefore will lose revenue. Merge mining isn't very attractive right now, and (oh the irony it would be) using federated pegs - that is antithesis to trustless decentralization.
I have heavily invested my time in bitcoin. We bitcoiners should embrace the Ethereum blockchain implementation - which is and will always be more decentralized and more secure. The fact that the official Ethereum blockchain implementation has 7 computer language implementations makes its blockchain  less vulnerable to attack than a sidechain, and it comes with higher guarantees of EVM code execution. 
And actually right now there is btcrelay, the way to send bitcoin into Ethereum smart contracts to execute code in the official Ethereum blockchain implementation. The role of smart contracts will have a much larger impact on the world than single function value exchange like bitcoin. It really then totally makes sense to have a separate coin to further unencumber bitcoin from loss of performance in its core functional use of store of value, and secondarily for clearance and settlement.
Can anyone tell me why two coins bitcoin and Ethereum can't both succeed in parallel?

Also, here's the inside scoop from conversations with businesses and large institutions at DevCon1: Bitcoin is not being taken as seriously as Ethereum. Ethereum has a larger value proposition with existing infrastructure and is highly more transformative technology. I also think there's still too much stigma as well surrounding Bitcoin for these enterprises to choose the bitcoin sidechain. I love bitcoin, but am sobering up to the reality that they are going to choose the pure Ethereum private and public blockchain implementation for in-house development and deployment.
