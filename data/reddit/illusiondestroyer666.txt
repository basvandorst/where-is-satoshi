@_date: 2016-08-24 05:21:48
Why do people keep lumping Bitcoin in the same group as blockchain technology?? The banks are NOT incorporating Bitcoin into their systems. This is like promoting an Etherum product as if it were good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-11 02:57:31
Now the question we need to ask is - do we want to regulate Bitcoin more so that we can ID people such as this thief better if they try to sell out? Or do we go with the anonymity (which would protect the hacker) but keep the protocol less influenced by central authorities.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:41:05
I won't comment on fungibility until regulation comes into play and we see how the politics play out (on an international level, not just US). There are thousands of different jurisdictions all over the world and many legal battles would take place through courts before fungibility would ever become an issue. Telling people they can't spend their property is difficult to enforce, especially as an international store of value without borders. If someone told me my Bitcoins were not acceptable because somebody bought drugs with them 3 years ago i'd tell them to go fuck themselves. Money is still money and somebody who doesn't give a shit will trade his goods and services for my Bitcoin.
People think Monero's strength is its anonymity. When in fact, that is its weakness because the government will NEVER stop harassing, manipulating and fucking Monero over. Monero Hodlers are delusional if they think any retailer or corporate is going to accept invisible money. The only niche it fills is people being criminal with their money - and in the eyes of the globalists - that is their greatest enemy of all - anonymity. Much more than people who hold Bitcoin or Gold. Opaque money is a crime in itself and the bankers will really stick their heels into Monero to fuck it over.

Yeah but you only need &lt;1% of that wealth to leak into Bitcoin. In a world of negative rates there are people that will be searching for assets with yield. I think Bitcoin is still very young and it's success as a safe asset will depend on the time it exists. If it continues to survive, more money will slowly come into it.

That's because it is a stable store of wealth (like gold) which you wouldn't take to the grocery store to buy groceries with (same as gold) but something you store and only exchange into fiat in rare moments (like gold). One day the bitcoin market will be worth trillions (like gold).
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:47:52
Mainly because I didn't know. I think it's a bit stupid that the program assigns a pool of addresses like that, otherwise what is the point of having a 'change password' option if it doesn't protect your future coins anyway?? That is akin to changing your password for your computer login or email address, to only still allow all previous passwords to continue granting access to your emails or computer.
It just makes things a little slower and more cumbersome having to swap computers or whatever to get hold of a new separate wallet that isn't online.
I think in future the backup wallet .dat files should only backup the addresses contained in the wallet at the time of the backup, for security reasons. Or at least make these things more obvious, alas core is still beta but it could be more user friendly as more fresh blood enters the bitcoin space.
I will move to a hardware offline wallet soon because of this reason.

Bitcoin is used for storing wealth. High fees show high demand for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:16:08
Because most other alternative assets are debt-based junk garbage.
Ever heard of the term "junk bonds"? Why would you put your money in trash when you've got BITCOIN.
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:01:55
It is all speculation until after a severe economic situation such as a collapse. We will only know then and only then, whether Bitcoin is really gold or not because people will either trust it enough to put their money there or they will seek something even *safer* which is gold, just to make sure their wealth is protected.
Gold is higher on Exeter's pyramid because it can last thousands of years while Bitcoin won't. But that doesn't mean that Bitcoin's utility in the current environment (digital gold that can move between borders) is not higher. Especially considering the issue of mobility in a world that is getting more fucked up. Imagine trying to move life savings in gold to a new country, it'd be a fucking nightmare.
There are enough people in the world who need a mobile safe haven asset. It is the collusion of people with mutual interests, needs and purpose that gives bitcoin value. No issues with game theory etc because the people actually *need* Bitcoin for saving wealth in the virtual ether in an unstable world, and so will working together (through bitcoin) to ensure mutual survival which is the only real alliance relationship that works amongst human primates.  People *also* need something deflationary because all other assets are garbage and give you no gains which fucks their retirement plans etc.
They also need a safe haven that can't be manipulated down, because gold is not functioning as it should due to intervention people aren't protecting their wealth great with it so now they have an alternative to protect their wealth that isn't the bitch of bankers.

It's hard to say. The speed in which technologies are being adapted by society is shrinking (example internet and smartphones). But at the same time there is a lot of political and regulatory resistance with bitcoin. Also it depends on the overlapping sidechains and how they will work.
I'm not a psychic but I think growth will be slow and steady with Bitcoin so yeah, 10 - 20 years sounds like a reasonable estimate. We're closing in on 10 years now.
EDIT: I want to add in terms of bolstering confidence, that as Digital Gold, Bitcoin has a very "bright" future ahead. Infact if you truly understood gold vs currency, you should be ecstatic that BTC is becoming gold, rather than just another currency to buy junk with.

Problem is most people these days grew up using only fiat currencies and don't understand the difference between backed vs unbacked currencies. We went off the gold standard in 1971 and since then have been using unbacked currencies that have a forced value due to military might and geopolitical consensus, that of which is losing now. All unbacked fiat currencies fail ad you cannot force value onto nothing without lies, manipulation, control and without holding a gun to somebody's head and telling them to accept it.
You can't have an unbacked cryptocurrency that is successful. It needs to be backed by a hard foundation or anchoring aka bitcoin/gold. You CANNOT have gold and currency together.

Many essential commodities and products are centralized, but the demand for these resources/products still exists. For example with Iron Ore (Rio Tinto, Vale and BHP) or Oil (Saudia Arabia, Standard oil). Or Apple vs Samsung. Centralization occurs because these stakeholders have the advantage of economies of scale, financial clout etc. Bitcoin's miner centralization follows the same mathematical pattern of nature where those entities with such advantages will dominate the market (alpha vs beta competition)simply due to their size. 
Bitcoin centralization will not impact on it's desirability in the longterm as an asset vehicle for wealth storage and borderless transfer.
Rare earth minerals were 98% concentrated in china but they were essential, so other nations have begun to innovate ways to obtain their own.

Bitcoin is a way for people to protect their wealth against rampant inflation and negative interest rates. It is a "safe" place to put your money outside the reach of banks and their wealth decaying policies.
@_date: 2016-06-26 04:12:59
So why isn't Bitcoin at Moon yet?
@_date: 2016-06-20 07:11:32
The point is, the Venezualans who held Bitcoin before this would perhaps be 'wealthy' enough now to buy food in a nation where the fiat currency has inflated to nothing. Food is scarce, but can still be bought at a high enough price on the blackmarket.

Dear fellow HODLers. I love you.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:55:15
OP. As a sticker provider, please push your business HARD because we need more marketing efforts for Bitcoin.
Stickers are a great avenue in which to reach out to other potential investors that need that extra little reminder.
@_date: 2016-06-04 07:24:27
lol wtf? Are you kidding me. If Bitcoin even nudged $400 you would have money flowing in like hell to buy back cheap at that price.
The blockchain debate is tech nerds not getting economics right.
@_date: 2016-06-04 07:26:30
GTFO Mike Hearn. I ain't reading his shit ever again after what he did to Bitcoin. Having said that i'm secretly glad because it kept the price down long enough for me to rack some more coins for cheap but even still, FU MIKE!

We need more marketing!!
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:47:03
Look at gold and the "fees" you have to pay transport it from vault to vault. It's the same analogy as Bitcoin except that instead of vault to vault it's from wallet to wallet. Slow bitcoin is strong bitcoin.

How can anybody tell without the figures? We need to know how much everything costs and whatnot. Somebody needs to come up with the numbers or else the debate is meaningless and devoid of substance.
@_date: 2016-06-07 04:21:05
It might. It would be the equivalent to Gold-backed currency that doesn't exist today if it does, and this depends on how the side-chains/layers work as you say (seg-wit, lightning etc). 
Or alternatively it will function the same as gold does and maintain a separateness to Fiat currencies, functioning as a store of value only.
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:45:25
Just hold. We all hold we all get paid.
@_date: 2016-06-30 04:28:54
Because of the underlying fundamentals, that's why.
@_date: 2017-01-14 23:58:19
The exchanges ultimately get their supply from the same market OTC BTCs are sold from. So taking up more and more in the OTC market will raise prices at exchanges by reducing overall supply.

$700's is cheap, dunno who would sell down to that level personally.
Actually on second thought,looking at the chart previous patterns, it went down after this period of low volatility. So it depends on if history will repeat for a third time.

@_date: 2016-06-06 13:26:13
I don't understand.. People are buying it? Money is and will continue to flow into bitcoin because of its wealth storage properties. There is no requirement for it to be used as a currency vehicle. You can't take a piece of gold bullion into a supermarket or clothes store and buy stuff with it and yet it is worth $$$. Same concept. Or art. Or wine. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:57:00

@_date: 2016-11-24 00:59:53
This is good. It gives investors a sense of relief that this investment is so wanted  by so many people. 
A product where demand is outstripping availability sounds pretty good to me. So much so that the fee to even participate rises as Bitcoin becomes its own halo effect of how good an investment it is.
@_date: 2016-11-16 22:29:54
Most investors are rich and have surplus everything. Street urchins don't buy things like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:29:36
Who cares about the average person again? The wealth is all concentrated at the top of the pyramid brah, and they generally make better investors.
Bitcoin will continue to attract wealthy investors and they can afford the fees and happy to pay.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:20:44
Fees give miners a bigger incentive to do their job properly, thus strengthening the network.
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:32:12

Better to keep it in China than let the wealth flow to another nation and its peoples.
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:15:52
The technical term is a "store of value". Something you purchase that takes care of your money for you and even adds a bit to the top over a period of time as a reward for choosing Bitcoin as your store of value, instead of that shitty bank you use for example.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:18:28
Stop reading the charts every 24 hours and look at the 2 year chart for bitcoin. Very stable.
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:06:14
The true longterm success behind Bitcoin is for most people to HODL a majority of their coins (kept like savings) and spend as they need to. So if BTC was $10k and stable i'd still keep most of my bitcoins stored - I wouldn't feel a need to quickly cash out.
@_date: 2016-11-25 02:23:04

Zerohedge was bought out a long time ago now. They spread the fake Trump vs Hillary dichotomy (they're on the same side dumbo!) as well as the fake USA vs Russia/China thing which is NWO propaganda because the NWO has them both on the same side, which they are as they are all on the same table at the IMF which is a global organisation that rank higher than nation governments.
It's becoming more obvious with time, like you can really start to see the way they are constantly changing the script on the current election to keep everyone guessing and thinking any could win and that Hillary is evil and Trump isn't, cept they're on the same side serving the same masters... 
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:24:56
Another tip. You gotta be in it to win it. Also, the richest bitcoiners were the ones that took the most risk and dumped a lot of $ into it. The more you give, the more you recieve.

@_date: 2016-12-25 23:31:57
Not really. But yes also. But Bitcoin is more like gold than a currency like the USD. 1oz of Gold is worth over $1,000 but you don't take it to your mall to buy your clothing and groceries with it. Have you ever seen anybody make a purchase with gold bullion? Probably not and yet people seem to like it don't they?

Patience. People here act like they have ADD. Things always take time. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:46:02
All fiat currency pays almost no interest and is also a very high risk asset to own long-term because banks, government and people are accumulating unsustainable levels of debt which is toxic and can potentially implode, wiping out economies.
Japan is the most indebted nation in the world and this gives its populace the drive to spread there assets into a safe haven.
It also rewards the people for saving in BTC because it grows in value.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:41:18

Government regulators, private sector collaboration. Very smart move, very very smart. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:42:47
Another benefit is that it brings awareness of BTC to the populace, so that more Japanese citizens invest in BTC. BTC is far superior to hold than yen that pays 0.1% interest. 
It's a strategic move aimed at bringing the nation out of the doldrums.

If you can't contribute time or skills to Bitcoin, then contribute by buying more bitcoins to support the price which will assist and incentivize others to keep improving Bitcoin. We're all in this together - let's make Bitcoin big.
@_date: 2016-09-11 22:54:56
Remember when the price was stuck at $666? There are whales involved in Bitcoin that are there to shake confidence
@_date: 2016-10-05 11:03:20
Which is why they have been trying their best to crush confidence, for example massively dumping post-halvening to shake people's belief in the investment.
Like pushing a ball underwater, it is only a matter of time before bitcoin shoots up again, they can't hold it down forever and each time they blow a wad, they have less ammo to use. They have to then buy back Bitcoins which raises the price - it's not like derivatives where they can cheat in their BS manipulation games.
Fuck the central banks!

I haven't ignored your critques. I've merely logically responded to them countless times why they are wrong in their assumptions until I got sick of writing the same shit hundreds of times (on my old account). Bitcoin is fine and on the right path. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:51:11
Bitcoin is autonomous. It will no longer be influenced at the whims of Mr Nakamoto
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:35:51
Most likely. The major central Miners in China would have met up and made an agreement to hodl together in order to raise the price leading into the halving. This of course would pull in more investors as a result of the momentum and create a new floor, assisting not only the miners but the investors as well that have Hodl'd until this point.
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:09:50
Bitcoin grows in strength based on loyalty. As a deflationary money with limited supply, the more people promote bitcoin in a good light and hodl bitcoin, the stronger and more powerful it becomes as a network. The more people invest in it too creating innovation. Everyone invested in Bitcoin helps it grow by promoting it instead of painting it with a shitty brush like Coinbase did. They should f off for that and I hope they crash.
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:52:55
Because Bitcoin is King! HODL

@_date: 2016-05-02 23:06:48
Bitcoin won't appeal to authority. It is now autonomous. Like an an AI organism using human hosts to do its bidding. Even if this guy is Satoshi, it doesn't matter anyway. He doesn't control it anymore.

Meaningless. Bitcoin is now autonomous in that anon controls how it evolves from now on.

This is good news.

For those of you who are heavy in Bitcoin should welcome this FUD as it allows you to accumulate at lower prices. Once Bitcoin goes up, you're not going to be able to afford to get so many more at that point as you will be buying in small fractions of a bitcoin isntead of buying whole bitcoins.

Hold up on the marketing for a ltitle longer, I need to stock up more on cheap coins
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:32:06
Interesting to hear your take on the matter. If you can't compete on labor costs, you'll have to out-innovate somehow. I hope the US can utilize its expertise in computer hardware to develop and secure equipment that can out-class chinese ASICs. As the Bitcoin space grows, you will get more smart minds investing in such things. Good luck!

That's why we have to HODL. The more that HODL, the stronger the price will be when traders dump.

Buy a trezor and stick them into that. Never felt better after transferring my Bitcoins to Trezor!

I'm always surprised, but very pleased with the amount of real economic discussion and understanding that occurs in the Bitcoin community. There is not a community anywhere else outside the fringe precious metals groups that have such an awareness

Make me rich dammit Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:06:57
Sure, but that involves having to use another service provider/wallet which may confuse some people. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:28:42
I'm not 100% convinced now that China would do that - they are for example pushing Gold very very hard right now to their citizens, and are not stupid in acquiring **key** strategic assets. 
The thing as well to remember is that these miners have invested way more $$ than your or I have into their mining infrastructure, so you can trust that they are even more aware and concerned than we are. They will most definitely have Business Continuity plans/arrangements in place.

Tech geeks always have difficulty in explaining things to the average man.
@_date: 2016-07-15 04:10:43
Agree with the mask comment below. You should be targeting the 'normies' of society and getting higher adoption from them. 
Marketing Bitcoin with the 'anti-authoritarian' spin doesn't make jocks or bimbos get any sense of excitement or interest. It may even incite avoidance and fear to some segments of the population/society.
You should be trying to make Bitcoin more accessible to the mass market. Market like you would to a person who has zero interest in computers and other 'geeky' stuff.
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:47:06
around 40%

Cool, cheers
@_date: 2016-07-10 00:06:19
Ok thankyou. I agree about the gravity well incorporated into the protocol. Im sure this will be integrated at some point should such a risk become more likely. It's good also that there is the incentive for miners to maintain the network during a crisis as they will gain greater access to fees and the lower difficulty. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 07:04:47
A bitcoin price of $900 will mean all current miners will be profitable.
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:14:09
Where do people like you come up with this stuff? You get so many people talking about the bitcoin market like they're experts on it and none of you are ever right about it. You just sound like a wannabe trader to me using terms such as "shake out".

There's something about Ethereum pumpers and backers that I find repulsive. 
Maybe the fact they're backing a closed entropy POS system that will fail, while still being smug about it.
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:34:00
Can you please elaborate on what happens if all Bitcoin miners were to be shutdown? So Bitcoin can be 'offline' for a while, and then safely power back on as soon as a new miner powers it up? So if there were say &lt;5 emergency miners hidden around the world, the difficulty would adjust down to compensate?
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:11:07
Does the transaction have to drop off the mempool first before I do this?
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:48:19
Ok, I get it now - makes a lot of sense after you put it straight like this.  I was running core all day yesterday and today so i'll give it another few days before I -zapwallettxes as my transaction may perhaps have traveled to a quite a few nodes by now.

Great, thanks for clarifying. This information is not particularly clear on the internet at the moment so I think your answers and this thread will assist others that have similar problems in future.

@_date: 2016-07-03 12:31:05
People like you assume this is an attack on the protocol as seen by the down votes. The fact of the matter is a lot of people will get stuck and so this guide is required.
As fees continue to rise, what was once a fee that would allow confirmations will eventually become a fee too low to obtain any confirmations at all and there will ALWAYS be people that pay under the new fee levels.
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:19:37
Sure, but being such a lucrative industry, miners will go underground the same ways drug cartels do. Others are already popping up in other nations too - there are people willing to fill the gaps.
Also a solar flare is getting a bit extreme. Basically everything would shutdown in those instances.
If you're smart though - you'd hedge 1:1 with gold just in case. Always have a hedging strategy and mixed basket if you want to protect against investment risks.

Just bought a Trezor but there are a lot of negative comments. Can I trust to use it??

Why do you parrot that stupid 1oz gold to suit comment? There is no rule in economics that says the price of an oz always exchanges for a suit. Please stop.

For myself and many others,using abandontransaction merely returns an error code. I'm not sure if this will be rectified in future releases but for now it seems like a bit of a dead-end.
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:17:01
Give me 50x now! $500 billion sounds reasonable in the long-term.
Stocks, property, currency (savings) and negative interest bonds all leaking capital into Bitcoin at some stage should do the trick.

You'll get it back eventually OP. But I can understand the angst. If I had $23k not in my possession I would shit myself. That's why I don't trade on exchanges anymore, helps me sleep at night.
