It's more than that though.  I feel exactly this way learning about bitcoin, longevity, general ai, the rate of technological advancement, brain-machine interfaces, etc.  We have been on an exponential rate of change for a few decades now.  We are now at a place in which we can "see the curve."  Seeing the curve, to me, gives a feeling of vertigo.  That surreal feeling that you were describing.  Hell, even simulation theory. I always thought of it as a joke, but there has been a recent study that grants it bit of legitimacy.  
When I try to take it all in I feel as if reality is just spinning out of control.

FB did say that it will be pegged to the dollar.  It's a joke that is bringing mainstream attention to real cryptocurrencies.  The next couple of years will be interesting.

I just started buying recently  and am very happy with this dip.  Novice here, but it seems to me that governments will only be able to regulate in name.  The hearings are bringing attention, which is dropping the price in the short term but bringing an air of legitimacy to the mainstream.  More money will begin to pour in, raising the value of a limited resource.  This will bring in further mainstream coverage. The true pump is on it's way and I just hope that I can siphon enough cash into it first.

That was bad ass.  Thanks for posting it.

The $25K thing is just what TDA required for futures and forex trading accounts.  The fact that they are opening up for standard account to trade bitcoin futures is another important step towards integrating as a legitimate currency to the general public.

I kind of like Yang as well.  I think he is early on the UBI but I feel it will become necessary at some point.  He seems to be the most well rounded candidate and not prone to political sniping.  I didnt vote last time because my options literally made me gag.  He is interesting, although I dont agree with him entirely.  Of course I dont agree with almost anyone on earth entirely.  He is likeable, experienced in things other than criminal politics, understands the true currents of the economy and isn't owned by special interests.

Yes, for the Chinese citizens.  Maybe not long for US citizens as well, but current manipulation in US is not as overt as China.

I totally agree.  And for the sake of clarity I dont think UBI is too early,  I think using it as a platform is too early.  I think, due to a lack of foresight, voters will view it as a gimmick and may actually serve to hinder his chances. I think the majority of people dont understand why UBI is necessary.  His platform is radically different from the politics as usual that I being followed by everyone else who is running.  That's another reason I like him, he sees the actual future needs and is presenting solutions.
