The price would've risen rapidly once sellers caught on. Imagine Bill Gates walks into a car dealership to buy something. They aren't going to give him a good deal. They'd immediately raise the prices on everything.

Okay, so Nakamoto hoarding those BTC appears to have had the opposite effect on liquidity - it's going up!

Liquidity crisis only happens in economies with debt-based money, not commodity-based money.

What was the currency in question, and what was its stock to flow ratio? Also, was it digital and global? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:40:58
Right, but Bitcoin volatility will decline as it saturates the global market. I don't think fiat will have a role to play. It had a role before we had fixed-supply digital money, because it overcame a lot of the inconveniences of transacting with gold. But that competitive advantage has gone away.

You're entitled to continue using fiat to trade, if you want. But most other people will switch to Bitcoin because it's more convenient, and doesn't lose value rapidly.

If finite goods can be cornered, how did Bitcoin grow more decentralized over time? Ownership was originally very concentrated and then spread out.

Nice. Keep on stacking! 
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:26:20
You'll be very late to the game! 
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:25:33
Prior to digital currencies, sure. But money technology has improved drastically.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:19:17
You dodged the question. Why hasn't Bitcoin been cornered by early adopters? All signs point to it becoming more decentralized as time passes. Why should that trend reverse? 
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:50:25
Sure, and there's nothing preventing the banking system (or an analogue) from implementing Bitcoin. The notion that granny has to use bitcoin's base layer is as silly as saying people need to use Linux and and command line functions to do things online. Over time the system is abstracted and refined to allow non-technically inclined people to participate. But by the time that happens, the vast majority of the speculative exchange rate gains will be gone.

Good question. That used to be my go-to site for price.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:11:32
Give me one good reason why that future isn't possible, or is even difficult to achieve.

Robert Putnam's studies on the effects of ethnic diversity are the final word on this. He found no cases where it helped. His studies showed it increases mental illness, stress, reduces trust, charity, participation in community activities, etc.

Humans try to shame each other for being too evolutionarily competitive. That's also why "White guilt" exists, and is pushed on Whites by other groups.

Horrible. Well I'm glad you are okay and you have a story you can tell your friends for the rest of your life. Hoard Bitcoin, don't trade it!

I'll take Japanese style stagnation over collapse by diversity any day. There is zero data showing diversity is good for an economy or a nation generally.

The point of the analogy is that in both cases, very minor accidents can have catastrophic consequences. Yet nearly everybody in society accepts the risk in one case.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:05:25
Also if you slip up and veer into the other lane, you'll collide with oncoming traffic at 140 miles per hour, instantly killing everybody in both vehicles.
Oh wait, we're talking about Bitcoin, not cars.

Leave it to the BBC to whine about muh climate change. These are the same people who want mass immigration into Western nations, which drives up consumption and land development.
