I do think that the futures option was a big mistake for bitcoin, that's honestly when things started to turn out terribly for it and price swings(mostly downwards) happened and the way it works it makes a lot of sense. 
I don't think that bullrun is all we will see, I just think it did get too big too fast, but year over year it's still growing, so it's bullish in that regards even with these price drops. I wish there was a way to get out of these futures/stock though.

Do they have to be every month at this point? How is this different from printing money?

Funny, one of my alts I'm holding right now is holding and gaining value, I'd rather have it over bitcoin anyway.

Well the one that I do have is probably going to be okay in this bear market. Not here to shill though, but they do have a good plan.

I'd rather not, if you want you can pm me and I'll let you know, but I'd rather not shill and it's still a relatively new cryto that is doing something I'm super interested in is all.
