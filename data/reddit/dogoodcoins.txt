My advice is condense and explain it yourself. Prepare answers to all the typical rebuttals like "Can't hackers just give themselves more?" or "Why is this better?" etc. Use pencil and paper and draw to help you. Learn how our current money system works and compare side by side.
If you can't do it or unwilling to do it then you need to learn more about it.
Showing a video just seems cheap. Questions will inevitably come up later and you'll need to be able to answer them anyways.

He wasn't living like a drug kingpin cause he was trying to conceal himself - Don't be a fucking retard.  
As for "freedoms that government has illegally taken from us". What? You're right to buy hard drugs at the local 7-11? You think that's a good idea because "It's your body" bullshit? Do you know the kinds of things people do on some drugs? It's not just "your body". Some drugs should be illegal and maybe you should learn about them before you spew shit about freedoms. You don't and NEVER HAD those "freedoms". If you fucking idiots had it your way you would legalize drunk driving right? ROFL

"pardon: the action of forgiving or being forgiven for an error or offense."
I don't think many of you are willing to admit he did something wrong. It annoys the hell out of me how some of you turn him into some kind of do-gooder that "gave the public a safer way to get drugs". He did it for money. For greed - Just like any other drug dealer. Plain and fucking simple as that. 
Here comes my inbox flooding of people ignoring everything in this post calling me an idiot. Herp derp.

What sentence would be appropriate? Clearly the consensus is to get off with nothing judging by the title of this post.
People posting cases of rapists/murderers getting free/little time ... How is that relevant? It's a problem of that specific case.

Is there ANY possibility that enacting this or "any" new type of code will cluster!@ something/be open to an exploit that could be very damaging? If the answer is no, is that because it has been thoroughly reviewed and there is 0% nothing has been overlooked?

Voidspace for Doge could be pretty fun. I think Doge is actually a really good currency for games due to the sheer amount. Too bad the darn thing will never get fully funded.

r/Dogecoin has a better chance to rally and get 40$...
I will Donate the rest of my Doge. 1.25 Million Doge to push the funding for the past ~1% if it makes it there. You can put my pledge info in your post. 
Or better yet Propose to Both bitcoin/dogecoin and have competition. Maybe bitcoin-ers will outdo themselves and actually give.

Is there any situation where a "hard fork" (block size debate or any other) where...
1. I would lose my coins
2. I would have to change/update wallet to lose my coins
3. Anything else scary that I can't think of
I've heard that ETH fork would potentially cause SOME users to lose some of their coins even if weren't involved in the scandal (from Antonopolis)
