Coinmama has a higher limit
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:45
The limit is $750

Ok, so even though transaction has not fully gone through (not in my wallet) my bitcoins will still act as if I had it in my wallet through the processing time?

So how did hodl become? What happened for everyone to stay saying hodl 
Someone was too excited typing in all caps and ended up making that misspelling ?

I did lock in the price, which isn’t even that low to being with. I’m not happy about losing the profits that could be made while my transaction is still processing 
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:43:26
I sold because I needed to use the money.
I actually didn’t even end up needing to use it, So lesson learned

I remembered when its only purpose was for dark web or weird transactions
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:25:08
I just did that.

Free money is money. 2% of $8000 is quite a large amount of spare change
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:04:12
Why? Because I was thinking bitcoin was going down and did not want to lose money. I sold it at 9k and got back the money I put in. No losses or gains.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:06:58
Those were purchased at Jan 6,2018. 
If I did not sell, I would have 812 now. When I sold, I got back what I invested (640).
I feel the price will go up another 2k+, so I want to buy back the bitcoins. Bad idea or no?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:52:36
Should I buy more bitcoin now or hope for a dip in the upcoming days?
Sold all my bitcoin a week ago at 9k and the next day it rose to 10k and now look where we are. Why did this have to happen to me :/
I calculated the value of my bitcoin now, had I not sold them, and the profit made me very sad.
