That's fine.  But I hope you understand that the vast majority of folks would never consider using a card like that since it offers only drawbacks compared with using a debit card linked to a normal checking account.

Derivatives have nothing to do with fiat or bitcoin or whatever.  Do you think people will not continue to create derivatives even in a BTC only environment?
It's scary to see people on this sub with so little finance knowledge.
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:52:06
No, they don't. Derivatives are zero-sum instruments by their very nature.  They do not produce any additional value.  They do not consume any value.  They cannot affect inflation.
I don't even understand what you're trying to say in the second part.  Most non-futures derivatives just expire worthless.  Talking about the notional value of derivatives is a total waste of time because everybody knows this.  Futures are always backed by real-assets.  Are you talking about understated counterparty risk?  Sure, that may be a factor like in '08, but again, that's not a problem Bitcoin would solve since people will continue to create derivatives even if there's no fiat money.

Dude, stop.  You don't understand how an ETF works.  It's impossible for it to trade at a consistent premium or discount.
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:27:59
Just stop.  The derivatives market has nothing to even remotely do with QE.  The derivatives market does not affect inflation or dollars in circulation since derivatives either end up being worthless or are backed by real assets.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:59:53
Except that card is riddled with ridiculous fees you wouldn't encounter with a debit card issued by a normal bank.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:08:58
No, it cannot *sustain* a premium.  APs will arbitrage away the premium or discount on a true ETF, unlike something like GBTC.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:28:06
I don't understand why some folks on this sub have to be so ridiculous about the realities of our society.
You know exactly what I mean.  A merchant swipes or dips a CC and they get a message in 5 seconds that says approved.  They know the promise of the bank to fulfill the payment is practically-speaking guaranteed; even if the customer can't actually afford the purchase.
Which is totally different from a BTC transfer with zero-confirmations since there is exactly zero guarantee that there are funds available. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:27:03
You just aren't understanding how an ETF works.  Very small ETF funds sometimes have small deviations from from the tracked asset when volatility is unusually high, but it's always temporary.  Go ahead an name me one ETF that has deviated from its tracked asset price for more than one trading day and you win it.
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:47:17
But what does all this have to do with inflation?
You're talking about an issue with labor markets and pricing, not an issue that has anything to do with currency.
In fact deflation would hurt most low income folks because the lower income you have the more likely you are to have large debts.   Debts hurts more when the value of a dollar increases.
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:51:28
Right because this is super secret information that nobody else knows.
I think you're underestimating the markets.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:50:13
Wat? Look up the definition of the term 'intrinsic value'.  In reality, paper money has more 'intrinsic value' because you can at least burn it to start a fire.
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:54:31
There's still a risk since you could theoretically make a few poor trades and lose value in the account before confirmations.
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:14:13
ETFs (unlike GBTC) can't sustain a price premium.

@_date: 2017-03-12 15:17:32
Yes, that is certainly what conventional wisdom should predict.
This sentence is nonsense to me:  "Bitcoin will rise with an interest rate hike because unlike Gold, there is further upside in the capital value of Bitcoin, so the need for some type of yield to offset it is greatly reduced."  
The false financial analysis on this sub is real.

You don't hedge a low volatility asset like dollars with a super high volatility asset like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:47:04
If you're worried about your money losing value to the dollar, you're not going to hedge by buying bitcoin. That would be monumentally ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 04:13:57
The most popular asset is the US Treasury Inflation-Protected Security, which is essentially a T-Bill with an inflation adjustment clause built into it.  This means that if inflation rises your coupon increases as well as the lump sum payment at maturity.
But there are also plenty of other corporate and muni inflation protected bonds.  You can hedge against anything in the modern financial world.

Yes, except the credit card issuer only allows that if there is a legitimate dispute.  Too bad you can't do things like this with bitcoin.  It's a rather useful feature.
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:21:51
I think you know exactly what's important to consumers when I say that the transactions are instant.  Reversibility is also a feature that's important to credit/check card users.
The bottom line is that it's ridiculous to use bitcoin for day-to-day purchases when you can use a credit card in today's economy.  The incentives aren't there for consumer adoption.
@_date: 2017-01-31 22:33:39
Credit card funds are guaranteed by the bank.  The merchant knows he's going to get paid.

There is such a thing as inflation-protected securities.
Bitcoin is something else.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:20:04
Except is it really a fair comparison?  The credit card transaction is practically instant, backed with the credit card bank's insurance, and accrues rewards for the user.
Whether you agree with it or not, credit cards are providing the right incentives to the right people to price Bitcoin out of day-to-day transactions (as well as pricing cash transactions out btw, at least in the US).

I don't know.  I don't think he gave an accurate description of what GBTC is.
It's an exchange-traded fund that will be publicly traded (albeit Over-the-Counter) where each share will represent some amount of bitcoins kept in reserve by the fund managers (I believe I read that each share will represent 1/10 of a BTC).  This is similar to a bitcoin version of GLD or SLV.
Bottom-line is more people will be able to purchase Bitcoins because now hedge fund/ 401K managers will be able to invest as well as folks who want to buy bitcoins for their IRAs for tax-free gains.
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:09:58

@_date: 2015-03-10 23:55:38
But would it actually be faster and cheaper than a wire transfer?  I mean how fast could that guy convert egyptian currency into BTC?  And what would the exchange fees amount to?  The cost comparison would depend on the amount, no?  And what it is the cost of having to explain to your client how to do all these things he probably doesn't understand?  Would it affect customer relations?  I would understand if the client requested BTC as a payment method, but I think it would do some damage to ask a client to pay in BTC.
I don't mean to burst your bubble, but even I'm not convinced it is a great idea to use BTC in that situation.
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:56:47
It's nonsense.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:37:37
Right... *to the US dollar*, but not necessarily imports from every other country.
With BTC it matters what the exchange rate is because there's almost nothing that you can buy that is actually priced in bitcoins.  It's always a price in dollars that is converted to bitcoins.  With the Euro and other national currencies, it matters a whole lot less what exchange rates are because things are priced in Euros where most of the people who own Euros live.
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:52:52
I think eventually enough people will have some BTC that they will easily be able to buy them from family or friends.

@_date: 2015-02-16 06:20:04
ETFs are backed with whatever the fund represents.  For example, if you buy GLD, you are literally purchasing a share of the fund's physical gold reserves.
If this BTC ETF comes around purchasing shares of the fund would mean you are purchasing a portion of the fund's Bitcoin reserves.
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:59:05
I was under the impression GBTC had an "Authorized Participants" mechanism that regulated the price.  It should be a pretty tight relationship.  Otherwise, the APs would arb the price back to sanity.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:48:27
Can you please explain?  Are you just claiming that wealth is down because poorer folks don't know how to get a positive return on capital?  Its true the economic system is probably the most in turmoil right now since the beginning of the industrial revolution, but that's because of the massive amount of new technologies that have been introduced in the last 20 years, but still I don't see what this has to do with currency.
If you're only investment goal is capital preservation it's pretty damn near risk-free in the capital markets currently.

I don't invest in precious metals, but this is not news to anybody who understands these types of financial products.  I'd also advise against doing your investment research on websites that sell freeze-dried disaster food.
ETFs at the end of the day provide investors more flexibility, liquidity, and hedging options you cannot get with the actual "thing" you want to invest in.  People who want something like a Bitcoin ETF want to be able to sell and buy puts and calls to protect their investments or to speculate cheaply.
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:12:46
Something like this takes a long time for a huge company like this.  It isn't just as simple as slapping a "bitcoin accepted here" banner on their front page and letting the chips fall where they will.

I have heard that some smaller exchanges do this to pump up their numbers and make it look like they are more popular than they really are.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:26:42
I got that.  But do you believe your thought process is in line with the average consumer?
I would think most people would want the cash rewards, ability to defer payments, ease of use of a credit card (don't have to charge it, don't have to take time to protect my funds, have fraud protection), various perks depending on the card (upgrades at airlines/hotels, additional liability insurance when renting a car, etc).  For me, and I believe most consumers (granted they have a credit card and a bank account), there is just little incentive to use bitcoin if the merchant doesn't pass on the savings. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:08:53
I think the bigger problem than derivatives premiums with bitcoin is that there is no brokerage that I would trust the survival of my business out there with.
People would only use Bitcoin derivatives when they can purchase Bitcoin futures from the NYMEX, CBOT, CME etc...  Which is really why the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF is so important.

Ok, do you actually have any evidence supporting you claims or are you just spouting nonsense?  The funds disappearing wouldn't do anything to the price of gold since the ETF tracks the price of the commodity, not the other way around.
You cannot convert Gold ETF shares into actual gold except in special circumstances.  And yes some ETFs do not carry physical gold because they derive their value from futures contracts.

Yeah, but they still competing on price with other businesses.
Also, I rather pay with my credit card to get 2% cash back than pay with bitcoin and get nothing back.  At least if they offer a comparable discount with my credit card I have a real choice and the business might get some of the savings also.

What you're talking about is increasing the value of labor, but you cannot do that by changing the store of value that people are paid with.
The value of unskilled labor has not risen as much as skilled labor.... But that has absolutely nothing to do with currency.
The primary driver of labor prices is supply and demand, not currency.  If a currency inflates and the price for the lowest skilled worker does not rise, it's because in the modern economy, low skilled labor is just not worth as much as it used to be due to things that have nothing to do with currency (robotics, automation, third-world competition, the internet, high-speed transportation).
The fact of the matter is currency going up, down, all around in circles only matters if you have investments or you have debt.  If you have zero positive or negative cash flow, it really doesn't matter to you what the future value of your cash is because by then you have already spent it.

Just buying BTC is a confusing process for non-tech people.  The biggest issue with bitcoins is that it brings together two areas with the most confusion and misinformation out there: Tech and Finance.
The average person (ahem.... in first-world democratic nations) understands that it's practically impossible to have their funds stolen from their bank account.  They don't want to play trial and error with the storage of their money.  They don't even want to think about it (and really... why should they?).  The idea of being your own bank is about as appealing as being your own farmer or being your own tailor to the "average person".  That's not to imply that nobody wants to do these things, I just mean that it will forever be in the "hobby realm".
I'm bullish Bitcoin, but I think the moment bitcoin catches fire is when you can convert your fiat into Bitcoins at your local bank for "free" (with a modest spread) just like any other currency and *gasp here come the downvotes* have your bank hold your BTC just like any other currency.
