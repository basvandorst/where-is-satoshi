Those "slaves" send home [more than $12 billion a year to their home countries]( so clearly they are being paid.

Although there is a some forced migrant labour in UAE (as there sadly is in most countries) it is actually [relatively rare](

Of course people are going to be sceptical and not embracing to the idea. It is a new currency, after all. 
I think it is only on that people leave behind any sense of reason for anything about btc.

Maybe it won't but I don't think it is unreasonable for people to want to understand who or where BTC came from. Knowing who the creator is, and what they stand to gain from BTC, is part of this process. The more that is kept obscured and hidden, the less people will trust BTC.

If you want people to use BTC, they have every right to question who made it and what their vested interests are. 
Remaining anonymous, even if done for completely valid reasons, still seems shady as hell to the general public.

This article is pretty fair. I wouldn't describe it as "not bitcoin friendly" and as an organisation I would not say BBC has any particular bias for or against BTC. 
This article makes reasonable points about the positives and negatives of BTC as a currency and as an investment, as well as giving good advice about limiting your exposure to such a volatile vehicle.

This is a common myth and is not true that Dubai was built or run by slaves. Labourers deserve to be paid more, true, but they are not slaves, despite what [Vice]( and [Johan Hari]( would have you believe. Practices like debt bondage and passport confiscation were never widespread anyway but have now virtually been stamped out since new laws were introduced in 2009. 
[A report by the Washington DC-based Centre For Global Development found that labourers in UAE are financially significantly better off than their peers at home.](
[Labourers in the Gulf send home more than $80 billion a year to their home countries. $30 billion of that goes to India alone.]( With that kind of economic clout, they can hardly be called slaves in any conventional sense of the word. That cash makes a huge difference to some of the world's poorest communities. 


Dubai has many social problems, I don't deny, but it does have a good side. For many people it has offered them jobs, opportunities, and a quality of life they would never have had at home. For millions of people, it *is* a nice place, especially if you have any interest [in seeing a megalopolis in the making](
