Failed proposal. So is xt. Quit trolling.

Or by that subs definition...not feeding people who have an opinion outside the echochamber circle jerk.


Except some of them simply have different opinions. Any non large block extremist was put on the list. Further makes me conclude you are just one of the trolls.

This. FUDDERS finna FUD.

Um okay. Maybe it bothers you. I think the threads sorted by controversial are done so appropriately. If is going to allow the big block extremist troll brigade, we should be able to at least read the thread in a reasonable manner.

Except they are still banning people. And now they have a "shit list" of "enemies of bitcoin" which, in reality is anyone who doesnt support their alt coins (aka aren't big block extremists). List is designed to influence downvote brigading and ignore all users on the list: 
is complete shit and has the most trolls of them all. You actually often seem like just another one of them.

Any coin with an "airdrop" is a complete shit coin.

What ever happened with this?:

You're free to have those...but when they are wrong, and there is no way they will ever get consensus, and it is way too fast of an increase, and then you keep going on about them, it becomes trolling. So stop trolling.

Those of you who want no censorship at all are dreaming and just being unrealistic. Any other community that exists would be taking the same measures in case of brigading. It wouldn't be responsible or make sense to let the eXTremist lemmings run around destroying the sub with altcoin pumping without at least con**troll**ing them a bit. Think about the impact on new bitcoin users for one thing.
