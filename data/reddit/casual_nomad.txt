Are you able to pull up any info to support that claim? Genuinely curious.

Its not a spam attack my friend. 
People have money
People want to spend money
How do i spend money?
I transact and transfer wealth.
That's what people are doing, moving their money from one place to another, the faster money moves, the healthier an economy is. Why hamper that?

Why would they censor a legitimate question about the future of the leading cryptocurrency?

The reason why is because China banned bitcoin exchanges yet they can still access Korean exchanges, thus, you are seeing large amounts of Chinas traffic flowing through Korea.

Majority of miners do it for profit and it costs a lot to hash 24/7. Will be really interesting, honestly, to see how many hang about out of the kindness of their hearts. I actually really hope lightening network works out, its a really neat piece of technology.

You said it right there.. Explain how taking money away from miners is positive for them and the network security?

And thus, you don't pay the miners, you don't get blocks, your non-mining nodes can't do shit and your chain grinds to a halt. It all comes down to the miners, no matter how your chain operates and no matter how many and how few non-mining nodes you have.

But the miners secure the network, why work against them?

Non-mining nodes do absolutely nothing at all except pass block info along to the next node. The less non-mining nodes on the network, the less latency between miners.
