Haha thanks though I still use my ps3. The info is much appreciated.

In Japan here, just woke up and slept through the drop from 250 to 100 and back to 170 again. I'm not concerned at all.
Holding strong.

It's currently growing too fast for its infrastructure, once that is in order it should stabilize.

yeah you can buy just $20 worth of bitcoin if you'd like. Think of a bitcoin as a $100 bill, it can be split into pennies, $20, $5 all sorts of parts..

You really should be verified at multiple exchanges. I've had no problems exchanging through coinbase before, but i'm not short-selling at all. I've only bought to hold.

Yeah people seem to have forgotten that current prices were a high just this weekend!

You do know you can invest whatever amount you would like right? You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin....

At first I thought the preview image on RES was a tampax box. It made me giggle a little bit.

It's not the end of the world yet, it'll bounce back eventually. I just hope you didn't buy in too high.

Mostly a gut feeling, but also the infrastructure (as in exchanges) aren't ready to support this sort of trading volume. If you can buy in while it is low and hold until a better exchange system surfaces, you'll probably do pretty well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:36:26
Then def just hold onto it- it'll be quite a while until it reaches it's full potential, and by then your .01 will probably be worth something.

I'm referring to exchanges, if they keep causing frustration like this, it will only be detrimental to people's trust in the bitcoin network itself (which i find trustworthy).

Get verified on an exchange NOW and wait until tomorrow, it looks like the price is going to come down more.

I've been happy with coinbase, but I haven't been short-selling at all, and I know other people have had qualms with their limits.

Over in south Minneapolis actually, right off the MCAD campus. I'm sure if it was an art student they could've drawn a nice QR code.
