My parents have already decided that "it's a scam" and "it's a bubble that's going to pop". I can buy any myself because I'm not old enough. Oh well.

People think it's a stock even though it clearly has not behaved like one.

I've heard Exodus is good. Is it?

How do you buy $50 worth? Do you buy a fraction of a Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:48:42
Oh man, you're right!
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:15:06
Cuase it's a huge milestone.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:40:31
How should I go about doing so?

He hated on my comment too. He's one of those people.

two downvotes, better add /s because no one can take a joke.

Would you mind explaining it to me like I am a 5 year old?

Apple 
I knew Bitcoin had the spike in the middle and I new that Apple wasn't too popular so it would've had a slow incline.

What?! The only reason why I have a way to pay online is because my parents gave me a debit card for something but never asked for it back. I use those $100 (I don't know how much is left in the card now) sparingly.

I'm pushing my dad to buy it before it hits 10k. Hopefully, he gives in.

There's that whole thing with Musk vs Branson vs Igor (which I personally like to call _The Space Race II_), so I'll be sure to look out for any early signs of potential investment.

Would you recommend using Coinbase, or are there better alternatives?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:21
What is BCASH anyways
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:45:44
He basically has $1.5 million dollars that he is unaware of holy shit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:18:46
Oh shit what if it becomes like a fractal and the more you zoom out it just keeps looking the same?

You can't compare Bitcoin to stocks

I think I understand the basic premise of it: GPUs are used to solve mathematical equations and then the owners are then rewarded with Bitcoin(or other cryptocurrencies), which is called mining. There are a limited number of Bitcoins and so far around 11 million of the 21 million have been found. The price of them keeps rising and Bitcoin is the most expensive one so far.
Is there anything I missed/got wrong?

Gonna ask my Dad tonight if I can invest.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:42:26
I'll just show my dad how it just broke 9k and it's gonna break 10k soon.
@_date: 2018-03-11 00:22:47
Does this mean that GPU prices will go down?
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:05:00
I sure do love having to pay at least double for my GTX 1080 Ti because people buy them in bulk to mine with which makes the cards a poorly suited for gaming PC builds.

My dad said “It doesn’t make sense to buy $10. If I were to buy, I would buy a whole one.”
It’s never going to happen.
