Good. I hope she cries often these days.

You are correct that the media is going to go into a frenzy over this.
Beyond that, I totally disagree with you.
This isn't the first time that Gox has screwed the pooch... in fact, it is at least the 3rd time of which I am aware, though by far the worst.
As my friend puts it, it's time to give Gox a "metaphorical Mussolini Treatment", a very active drawing and quartering of Gox by the Bitcoin community, as Gox deserves.
Long term, the removal of Gox from the equation is a positive for Bitcoin and the community, and a chance to decentralize the exchange segment of the Bitcoin infrastructure.
Short term... yeah, it's going to be painful, and get a lot of negative press and scare people off. But it IS necessary.

You have some valid points here, but this isn't the first time Gox has screwed the pooch, so the idea of "removing Gox" isn't a 'sticking your head in the sand" and ignoring it kind of thing. Quite the opposite.... as my friend puts it, it's a "metaphorical Mussolini Treatment", a very active drawing and quartering of Gox by the Bitcoin community, as Gox deserves.

As for "thinking of other people instead of one's self", except for perhaps donating to some sort of charity that might reimburse losses, there's not much I can think of to help those who have lost coins in Gox. What do you recommend?

I've never been a big fan of Newsweek, but this incident makes me hope to see them on the trash heap of media history once and for all.

Hahaha! That's awesome. Good use of the original Newsweek cover... :-)

Wow.... VERY good point. That might also have implications for exchanges like Vault Of Satoshi, where they recently brought down all sorts of restrictions on US users of the site. This should be interesting to watch.

Good job! I've actually considered setting up some wallets with $10 or $20 worth of Bitcoin and giving them out (along with the keys) as Christmas presents this year.

Well, well.... looks like Darkstar was on the right track after all.

I'm with everyone else. Post a link in here to the podcast... I'd be interested in hearing it.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:22:02
Again, people downvote completely relevant comments.... wake the fuck up, idiots! You already CAN buy groceries online with bitcoin, as well as many other foods. I believe that is the point that this guy was trying to make!
Herp derp, you downvoting morons....

"Waaahh! Someone posted a photo with the word 'fuck' on it... I'm gonna vote it down! Herp, derp...."
Buncha fuckin' pussies....

"The United States, with extreme hubris, says to the rest of the world that 'the dollar is our currency, but your problem.'
I now say unto the United States that Bitcoin is *our* currency and *your* problem. Karma's a bitch and what goes around, comes around."

Hmmm.... 10 down votes. Maybe people need to go re-read the reddiquette. This is clearly relevant, on-topic and reflects the views of many Bitcoiners. Voting it down because you don't like the word "fuck" is pretty much breaking the reddiquette.
Just sayin'.....
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:23:33
This has probably already been said (I'm not going to read 1000+ comments), but "WTF? What a bunch of crap!"

Hahaha..... nice. Dogecoin.....

Well, well.... look at what I found in the [reddiquette](
"**Please don't**
*In regard to voting:*
Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons."
Seems like there's at least 18 people here on reddit who need to read the freakin' rules! (Though, I'm sure there are WAY more than that...). Obviously, this is on-topic and certainly is thought-provoking, whether one agrees with it or not. It's pretty clear this was only down-voted out of emotional, jingoistic, bullshit reasons. Wake the eff up, people.
