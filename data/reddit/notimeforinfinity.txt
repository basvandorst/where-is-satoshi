The value comes from the brilliant programmers putting in the work to see central banking die. 
If the programmers stop working I'll sell, but I believe in them.

Prime coin approaches the ideas in the Suarez books.

This video talks about arbitrage features and how you can easily set up if/when programs based on news...Like [Sobel's death]( in Daemon.

Soon with a satellite back up.
