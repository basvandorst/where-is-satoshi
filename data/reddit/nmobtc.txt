But I thought that the Open Assets Protocol involves including what people haven written as "metadata" into the OP Return of a bitcoin transaction.

If someone tries to spam the blockchain then could legitimate transactions just apply a fee and miners could ignore any free transactions?

THIS is exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you

Again, I greatly appreciate your input.  One other question for you if I may.  If TCP/IP is currently still being updated (albeit yearly, bi-annually), why do we hear arguments that better protocols other than TCP/IP were invented but won't gain any traction because of network effect if perhaps the improvements can possibly be integrated into the current TCP/IP suite?
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:20:02
Wouldn't pricing incentives make it acceptable to those storing the block?  Please elaborate
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:29:01
Then how is Gyft and Nasdaq using Bitcoin to transfer assets?
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:46:10
So the asset is forever tied to that specific 1 satoshi which was sent to the recipient and not his wallet address (directly)?
@_date: 2015-06-05 12:35:50
I just looked up TCP/IP on Wikipedia and see what you are saying.  Do you happen to know of the last time a protocol was added to the TCP/IP suite?  
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:36:45
Hence would you say that the current TCP/IP is unable to be improved in its current state unless something exponentially better is introduced?
It seems that the "transport layer" of TCP/IP has several protocols.  Do you know if all of these are dependent of eachother (alluding to sidechains) or completely independent?  
Also, I guess the difference between these protocols and Bitcoin it the  security relating to the communities willingness to mine the protocol.  Would you agree?
Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:43:25
I mean to say that if I receive a satoshi in my wallet and it contains metadata labeling that satoshi as an asset will that specific satoshi that I received be the only one in my wallets of millions of satoshis that contains an asset.  Do I need to transmit the satoshi that I received to transfer that asset or theoretically any satoshi in my wallet?

I personally feel like the anarchy aspect of bitcoin could quickly get squashed unless there was large unrest of the public.  Your point on off-chain clearinghouses is interesting, but aside from the chargeback policy's of credit card companies (which could be implemented off-chain) don't you think it's the same thing as having a traditional payment system since it's off the chain?  What benefit would it bring and how/why would it be cheaper than credit card transactions, wire transfers, ach deposits, ect.
Are wire transfers, ach deposits, credit card transactions only expensive because there isn't a better technology around or is it a cost of regulation that could be placed on bitcoin companies as well?
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:49:35
Can you elaborate?  If I send the satoshi you're saying that it will no longer be colored yet it's forever tied?  Then how can I transfer the tied asset?
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:52:45
Forgive me for my ignorance, but then how is Nasdaq using bitcoin to transfer assets in addition to Gyft?
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:25:16
So are you on the same page with me in wondering why services like Changetip and Coinbase which allow seamless payments between "in house" users is so hyped?
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:42:43
I find it interesting how so many are touting the block chain technology as Bitcoin biggest perk yet we haven't seen any killer apps yet utilizing it aside from a currency.  I'm not trying to bash bit coin, just want to have a real conversation about this.
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:46:23
So much talk about Bitcoin disrupting everything. What is the backbreaker that banks won't be able to adopt if we now know that they can do micro-payments and enable things like Changetip with some investment?
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:31:05
You mean they are correct?
@_date: 2014-10-27 03:21:38
I don't see how this relates directly to the issue we are discussing...
@_date: 2014-10-27 03:20:16
If government bans it then sure you can still use it but the mainstream won't use it which will sap it of all its network effect.
Governments will likely regulate bitcoin and I don't see why they will be less lenient compared to fiat.

Yea it depends on the transaction but ACh takes a couple days.  I'm assuming that you mean debit/credit card transactions?
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:05:16
It's interesting though because I have done both all while having my account open in a separate browser (Firefox) before enabling 2FA and changing my password but upon refreshing it's still logged in!
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:16:20
Interesting.  I suppose that the intrinsic factors of being able to send bitcoin to literally anyone with a 10 minute confirmation window as well as showing proof of ownership regarding colored coin transfers is a benefit which is currently not available in the fiat realm (except maybe Paypal?) and therefore the cost in current fiat structures does not reflect these added benefits?
Do you think that traditional fiat banks have the ability to adopt the micropayment mechanism you just mentioned?
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:40:40
I agree
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:22:09
So then why is it being made out to be such a big deal?  Same thing with micro-payments.  With a centralized ledger, can't a bank initiate micro-payments at near zero cost and instant transfers?
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:34:54
But then don't you feel like Bitcoin is being hyped?  I feel like Bitcoin visionaries and Venture Capitalists are calling BTC a huge disrupter but then I hear Changetip and a lot of other use cases that exist with BTC right now can be replicated by the current banking industry.  Know what I mean?
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:28:49
Pardon my ignorance of block size economics, but are you saying that there is an inverse relationship between block and transaction price?  Interesting point about the ledger being copied network-wide each time, but then why does it takes 3-4 days on centralized systems compared to 10 minutes (one confirmation) with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-27 02:08:33
If this is true, then there seems to me a LOT of disinformation going around by "top-thinkers" of the bit coin community who seem to be indicating the asset-tracking/transfer &amp; currency aspects of bitcoin are much cheaper than any other tech out there.

@_date: 2014-10-26 23:11:13
I know where you're going with that.  I have heard that titling and all ownership transfer costs can be brought down significantly, which is why I am curiously as to reason Peter has made such a statement.  
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:35:59
Perhaps as the costs associated with bit coin processing go down and the number of transactions on a global scale between all payment systems does not grow exponentially then the difference in cost-efficiency will be negligible and therefore void.  What do you think Vitalik?  
Also, why do people tout micropayment systems as an advantage of cryptos when it seems that perhaps a fiat-based entity could perhaps do the same if not better job?
@_date: 2014-10-27 03:29:37
Aside from the fact that upon withdrawing from a centralized micropayment ledger you will have bitcoin verified on the blockchain, will the micropayment processor be any cheaper that a micropayment processor could be based on fiat assuming a very competitive and therefore non-monopolistic environment in both fiat and bitcoin?  If so, is it do to a tech aspect of bitcoin, regulatory cost, ect?
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:44:44
I completely agree.  I am speaking as far as opening the doors to strict institutional capital who cannot purchase bitcoin from let's say Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:54:24
What are you trying to say?  I saw someone comment that people will be able to buy in the US.
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:34:48
Very true
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:59:48
So is there an direct relationship between the total transaction fees per block measured in (block reward * price) and voluntary transaction fees to overall network security?
If everyone stopped mining today or the total hash difficulty was extremely low, would I be able to go back as far as the first block and start rewriting everything?
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:58:13
I don't know since I haven't made a deposit/withdrawal yet.
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:15:44
He seems to be undecided on dynamic vs static am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:15:00
I'll admit that I am not incredibly educated on the subject of mining, but it seems that a dynamically changing blocksize would eliminate any worry about arbitrarily increasing the size in the future.  I know the difficulty level is a dynamically changing factor in Bitcoin.  What if there are a lot of companies who are doing off-chain transactions or simply cannot commit to a scalable blockchain tech because the blockchain size is too small right now?  How would anyone know?  The opportunity costs seems greater with a rigid blocksize limit.  
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:43:57
Can you elaborate on what you mean?
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:04:15
LOL I know
@_date: 2015-05-07 20:52:11
Yea what gives?  I'm hearing two different stories here.
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:35:29
I could've sworn in the statement that they said it'd start trading May 18th
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:06:07
But if miners decide to immediately sell their fees for fiat wouldnt you say that its effect on price is neutral?
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:03:10
Have a fantastic weekend!

Interesting opinion, but could one say that the rulings could be changed once bitcoin reaches more pervasive adoption?  I could be wrong but it seems that the property status serves long-term investors of bitcoin currently.

@_date: 2015-03-02 20:34:10
Thank you for your answer.  So you believe that the robustness of Bitcoin's mining network will prevent something like Ethereum from becoming just as big unless it is 10x times better than Bitcoin and therefore gives incentive to purchase ether?
@_date: 2015-03-31 04:23:45
Thanks for the response Mike.  Is it your current belief that micro-payments are potentially going to be resolved by third-party applications in the long run?  Including the elimination of what would be a large miner fee for very poor nations who may use BTC in the future to transact with each other?
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:56:36
Vitalik, ive read your comments that ethereum will likely be sidechained with Bitcoin at some point. Would this entail a brand new version of ethereum resulting in an independent ethereum and sidechained ethereum or can the ether that you plan on launching in March be sidechained with btc?
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:13:00
How so?
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:32:30
Interesting to know.
The only broad issues I have heard mentioned in the forums are the future unfeasibility of micropayments and the resultant effect this may have on the poorest of the world using Bitcoin where a few cents of transaction fees is worth exceptionally more than in the industrial nations.  Also, the current proposals to allowing quicker "confirmed" transactions be it the lightning network, off-chain transactions, ect.
I appreciate the input.
