There's people on this sub who unironically believe something among those lines.

Exactly, years ago when I was little I saw a famous rich family at the airport eating in the same restaurant that my family was eating and we saw them paying with coupons, and at the time my dumb ass though "lol why they even need to do this, if you are that rich why bother embarrassing yourself using coupons"

Escalability: there's no clear solution about this in the future and other cryptos like Nano already fixed this problem.
Volatility: theoretically this will be fixed by itself some day, but there is currencies nowadays that fixed this already, like DIA.
Privacy: Bitcoin is not flawless in terms of protecting the privacy of the people using it, and other currencies like Monero are way better at this.
Bad for the environment: other currencies nowadays already fixed this problem too. 
Fees: same as above.

The thing is that bitcoin unlikely will ever fix some of its major problems, and other cryptos are already fixing those things, and that was my point, crypto is probably the future, but bitcoin was probably just the first model. In my opinion Crypto is like the telephone technology, and Bitcoin is the first psychical model of the phone that was ever created, the technology and principles carried on but the model became outdated rapidly.

The only problem i find with your comment is that you say that Bitcoin is the alternative and not crypto, because in reality Bitcoin could work as stored value but it seems pretty hard to see it working as a worldwide massive currency due to all the problems it has. This reminds me more of all the internet companies in the 2000's, internet was the future, but when the bubble blew up, of all the supposed internet companies that were supposed to change the world only really few survived and became giants.

What's the goal of hodlers? hold it untit when? i'm just curious, i'm kinda new into this.

Censorship resistance is one of the few reasons that I believe cryptos are gonna be extremely important in the near future, but I'm not sure if Bitcoin is the one best suited to play that part, other cryptos like monero seem more suited to play this role.

I own some bitcoin but i'm not sure about bitcoin being be the crypto that will change the world, Bitcoin clearly has a lot of flaws that probably will never be truly fixed and all the other cryptos with solutions are all over the place, maybe the crypto that will take over the world hasn't even been created yet.

So even if is for pure hype and speculation the price will go up, until the hype falls and crashes for fear and because people will realize that Bitcoin is still the same currency that was in 2018.

Yes is the minimum in the CEX.io app

I agree, global economy now looks like it's going in s positive direction . But global economy was heading towards a recession just 4 mounts ago, none can't really know the forecast 4 months from now.

So libertarians are Republican, socially liberal (Democrat), and about fiscally conservative, this is a little bit tricky, contrary to the old perception, Republican presidents since Reagan have been blowing the debt and the Democratic presidents try their best to shrink it, but even then most Republicans still believe that they are the fiscally conservative so yeah even if they data doesn't back up that believe, the people here that consider themselves "fiscally conservative" are probably republicans. So imo is 60-70% Republicans and 40-30% democrats on this sub, but let's be real, most people that own bitcoin mainly wanted to get rich.

Again using data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, these are starting and ending federal debt numbers since President Reagan. I’ve computed the total percentage increase and the compounded yearly rate.
What the numbers show is that the total debt increased the most at 184% over 8 years and at the fastest rate under President Reagan at almost 14% per year. In fact, the three Republican presidents had the fastest growing debt on a yearly basis.
"Republicans cut taxes to force the government to shrink."
You really believe that Trump and Reagan wanted to cut taxes to just "shrink the government" lol. With those tax cuts the middle class barely saw any difference, it was mostly a trillionare tax to billionaires because they needed to pay favors to their donors and because both but specially Reagan believed in trickle down economics, an economic strategy that has been proven again and again that is a total failure.
Also you are rewriting history, there's no way someone would be blaming just Clinton for the housing bubble, is a fact that Bush pushed the housing market too and pushed for the deregulation and less oversight of big banks.

People from rural areas and old people are the people less engaged in technology, especially cutting edge technology, and both of those groups are the main demographics of the GOP, and in the present day and historically the main groups of demographics when it comes to developing/pushing technology are people from big cities(California and New York, both blue cities) and young people ( 70 percent of voters aged 18 to 24 voted for Democrats in 2018). Both of those groups are mostly blue, so yeah, even if you are being downvoted you are right.
