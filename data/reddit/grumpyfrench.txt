@_date: 2018-08-28 12:49:56
lol :) but realistictly i like to have "margin of action" (not sure if it means something english), so i'll put only 30% or so for now
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:50:27
6300 - 6400 was my target to add more
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:10:14
if you use localbitcoin for getting Cash .. you get a nice 20% spread .. not sure it is better
we really need more BTC to Fiat, with reasonable fees- without the need of a bank

yes !!!!!
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:36:35
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:58:12
Yes .. but the real question is why do we need to differentiate coinbase?  why such a special treatment
we do not have a 'isBinance' or whatnot
@_date: 2018-10-28 07:22:34
Basically you have a margin. You can totally lose. For example 10x leverage you use 0,1 btc to have 1btc in position. If price goes up 10% you gain 10% of 1 btc. Equivalent to 100% of your margin. So 0,1 btc gain.  But if it goes opposite direction you bet. You can lose all your 0,1 btc. You can do this on deribit or bitmex

there is the concept of "normal managment", I think it you have a compagny trading everyday you are subject to tax, but not as indivudual doing a few trades but i'm not a lawyer, so hard to really understand the distinction

Should be 10min? It's fucking boring to wait 1h or more
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:56:18
I would add, the "stop market order" will cost you a lot. if you are 100x, it will be around 15% of your margin in fees, so use limit orders to buy or sell (if possible , not always)
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:57:49
lol actually funny
@_date: 2018-10-13 12:21:50
