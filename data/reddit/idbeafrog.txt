Also if that wallet had a balance before, I think May, of 2014 then you have clamcoins you can claim. They did a distribution method based on active btc, ltc, and doge wallets. So look into that!

you just transfer it to an address of your choosing

I think it's valued on the level of trust that it will be there tomorrow.
With so many people invested in mining, trading, investing, payment processing, hiding drug money, and whatever else is propping this market, odds are it will still be there when you wake up.

This scenario I think would only occur if very few entities were left holding bitcoin, and in that case it would be necessary for these entities to invest in preserving the network, maybe by generating fees for miners.

People keep bringing up your idea of an "ASIC Storage Device" but no one actually has an idea of what that would be, or why it wouldn't have been created already.
I'll try to only talk about the Burst algorithm since Chia isn't released yet and we can only speculate, however we can assume they will be similar.
As far as Proof of Capacity goes, before you ever reach the hard drive you need a device to generate your POW nonces that will be stored on the drives. Got a magical 1000 Petabyte ASIC storage device? Have fun filling it up! A high end cpu or gpu can generate about 5GB worth of nonces per minute. And your device needs to accept data transfers at that speed.
(for the record if there is an attack vector involving ASIC's I believe it would be here. Just speed up that POW and generate them on the spot instead of bothering with storage at all. However, a code fork renders your ASICs ugly paperweights while HD's on the network could be replotted to the new format)
So you've managed to fill up your Mass Storage Device with nonces. Great, now you need decent read times to be able to check them all before the next block starts (Burst rounds are typically between 30 seconds and 10 minutes)
So you have a device that needs decent write speeds, good read speeds, and most importantly stores a LOT of data.. You're describing a hard drive, and if you could make a better hard drive you'd be better off selling it to consumers because as he mentioned there is a $150 billion dollar storage market that has been dying for a device like yours.
On the topic of waste, network difficulty is basically a representation of $'s dedicated. So lets say I buy a $150 HDD and you buy a $150 GPU. They both have primary uses unrelated to our use, and they both represent the same degree of network difficulty. The difference is that your's burns 10-20x as much energy to get the same job done. That sucks for you and that sucks for the world.

I think all crypto started with, and most still have mining equipment that is inherently useful, like cpu, gpu. So I don't think this brings in anything novel that way.
The function is also non-useful. It's not like a Storj or a Maidsafe. The drive space isn't used for anything other than proving difficulty.
Also, there is a considerable time investment in plotting the drives, which dissuades coin-hopping, which is common with proof of work.
