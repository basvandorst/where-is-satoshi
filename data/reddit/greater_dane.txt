Could be many things. My issue was antivirus blocking the program, miners, and internet connection.

Many years from now when I tell stories of the wild days of bitcoin, this will be one of them.

Is 3D printing a QR possible yet?

Any guides on using Eclair CLI on Windows would be greatly appreciated

If that was me I'd have a different Lambo for every day of the week now.

If you bought at 20K then sure this might seem low. If you bought just a month ago you would still have many times your initial investments.

this is my sentiment. the real question is how long before 1 btc is taken from you, not how long you will hodl.

Got an open channel on BLW for android. Éclair mobile and éclair on my full node don't seem to work for me.

Ive been troubleshooting mine a few weeks now, the Raspibolt guide doesn't seem to work on my setup, just freezes trying to install core. Im also trying to run the blockchain off network drive so theres that. Im interested in any guides you use!

Can confirm, as an "average person" I get separated from my wallet every month.

I opened and filled all my channels, haven't spent anything so they are still full. How does one go about creating inbound capacity?
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:19:47
Guess I'm not doing it right. 0 relayed transactions with a node running for 3 weeks now, connected to ACINQ and Bitrefill. Granted they are $5 channels.

Sounds like this is simply a Raspberry Pi with the blockchain and Lightning Node already installed. I installed Eclair and opened a channel over my synced Bitcoin core in just a few minutes the other night, is this different somehow?

I'm buying coins directly, although I guess Grayscale is useful to get crypto into a retirement account? Someone with more experience will have to chime in there. I believe there are quite a few Blockchain ETFs not solely tied to a single crypto asset, I follow KOIN, BKKCF, BLOK, BLCN, LEGR.

Thanks for sharing the guide. I am going to try setting up Lightning node on laptop tonight then try out the Raspberry installation.

Coinbase fees + bank cash advance fees + taxes is enough deterrent for me at the moment. I am hopeful this will be resolved soon.

Seems to me like these forks are really just printing free currency, the new coins are independent of each other. Imagine everyone holding 1 'green' color USD was given a 'red' color USD for free. These people now have two currencies to do business with. The value of the original 'green' USD has not changed, just everyone also has 'red' USD to spend/trade as well.

Steam accepted Bitcoin payment until about a year ago when fees went crazy and has since removed the option.

I don't know much about the ATMs but would probably agree. 
The ones around here are 5% fee + $5 transaction fee. If I was more concerned about being anonymous I might use them despite the fees.

Observed actual lines to use Bitcoin ATMs at different malls this holiday season. 
Buying paper wallet gifts? Just showing off? All exposure seemed good anyways.
