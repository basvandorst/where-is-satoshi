The price is already correcting.  If you are going to buy do it soon.

Im waiting till the stores open this AM and I am going to get some rice to try this out.  I would love to not have to get another laptop.

coinbase is going to be your best best.  The problem that you are going to run into is that it is going to take 5 days (or so) to verify your account and to get your first coin.

I dont think you really can stay anonymous using coinbase.  Unless you only use coinbase to get BTC and then transfer that BTC to your anonymous BTC wallet.

lol.  It was coffee for me.  I was thinking "don't spill it, don't spill it" and I spilled it all over.  :-(
At least with grape soda it smells good!

So - update on this - the rice works to get the moisture out!  However, it was too late and now the screen backlight will not turn on.  
Moral of the story?  Dont spill coffee on your laptop.

They work fine for me.  Its not an exchange like mtgox though and you pay extra money to be able to easily access your coins and bank account.

What is the process to get a consensus?
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:13:05
So...  What is stopping "bad people" from updating it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:28:18
How would that affect the ability to use bitcoin as a currency?

No kidding!  I spilled coffee on my laptop this morning and need to get another one.  Just need 1 btc.  (Anything I get above 1btc I'll donate to charity!)
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:42:20
same thing happened to me...  at the ~300 level.  Buy and hold.  BTC is not going away.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:54:28
Really? 
I feel like this is a trick.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:53:16
Figures.  Oh well.  I have to get a new laptop the old fashioned way - Work until I drop!
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:09:27
Thanks man.  I am trying to learn as much as I can about bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:48:34
Ill toss this in as well...  Nothing feels as bad as watch coffee flow out of your laptop.  :-(
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:44:01
But..  Since this is a global thing, everyone would have a say (right?).  That makes me feel better.

What software are you using to mine?

Thanks!  As soon as it happened the laptop powered off.  I said @ and then I unplugged and removed the battery.  I spent the next 2 hours removing the rear cover and using a blow dryer to try to dry everything out.

Buy, Hold, repeat!
