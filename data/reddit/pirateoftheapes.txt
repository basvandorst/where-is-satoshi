Sorry but this comment fundamentally misunderstands that laws and government are in place only under the consent of the governed. This is the only way that government has any form of legitimacy if not under the barrel of a gun.

In no way whatsoever will Gavinspamcoin ever be considered bitcoin by anyone remotely relevant to bitcoin space. Tread very carefully, you stand to lose all value if you go along on this fork.

Or you have transaction fees climb which eliminates spam at the root. There's less ability/incentive to spam the network if it's expensive to do so, no? Isn't it trivial to spam the network with additional transactions if it's free to send them?

Alright, if we're doing this for the sake of the other readers: Dear Reader, do not be like our challenged, mouth breathing lifederp above and "read through some of the logs" and feel like you have an opinion on the matter at hand. Read and then re-read for yourself what relevant individuals have to say about the blocksize in the above link. Then if you want to follow along with bitcoin read through the  logs of freenode chat for about a year. Or continue your irrelevant derpitude. These are your options. Signed, POTA

What don't you understand? If you follow an imbecile you're going to get squashed. Learn to understand who your betters are. The leading thinker on blocksize economics is none other than Pierre_Rochard. Learn what he has to say first then come up with a reasonable question eh?

Not launder just convert to cash and get into a bank. 4% is pretty steep...I don't know, what would you suggest OTC?

Perfect, thank you for the candid and honest response. Maybe this is getting close to exactly where the ideological lines in the sand are being drawn? Regardless, it makes me incredibly curious to hear what you have to say. Hopefully I can persuade you otherwise!

BPT You can give your son small amounts of bitcoin without having to broadcast a transaction each and every time. Print out 100 paper wallets and send 10-100 mbtc to each in one transaction with your electrum wallet.

Bitcoin is elitist what's wrong with that?
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:37:08
You asking about the [WoT]( To matter at all in bitcoin you must be in good standing there. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:56:04
You're asking the wrong question. Check your premises. Bitcoin is more for people with money, not for people without.
