Yes it is! He is great

This does not make sense. People are not going to get robbed because of a phone case design, silly. So rather than robbing someone that drives by in a nice Mercedes or BMW, a robber will choose you instead because of your phone case? (Btw, I’m not saying it isn’t safe to drive a Mercedes, I’m just trying to show how ridiculous of a statement this is).

Commenting to teach my gf about inflation verses bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:23:55
I find this interesting. You all talk about mass adoption through the use of bitcoin as a currency. Yet, you tell this story and laugh at the people who used it as a currency, saying you should “hodl” therefore making btc a security, not a currency.

Dominos doesn’t accept bitcoin, they only take bitcoin cash lol
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:18:36
No it’s because 1 dogecoin = 1 dogecoin 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:22:27
Lmao. It’s the opposite of the “it’s not delivery it’s digornio’s.” “It’s not pizza, it’s dominos” 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:24:01
It is the worst trade deal, possibly in the history of trade deals 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:21:19
Why not both?
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:50:24

I own 24 million bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:25:02
Well if 1 DominoCoin truly = 1 Domino pizza, then dogecoin is the way to go because 1 dogecoin = 1 dogecoin. And 1 dogecoin is a lot better than 1 domino pizza 
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:22:10
“Bought it years ago... Maybe it’s gone up in value...” 
Well before you even find it I can tell you that it has in fact gone up in value over the past few years. Lol.

You may be able to take my Bitcoin.. but you will NEVER take my dogecoin! 
@_date: 2019-03-12 06:04:57
Well if history is an indicator of the future then I suppose you are correct.

She/he deserves to be paid in trident layers so he can exchange it for bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:59:44

@_date: 2018-12-15 21:38:01
But how does the price dropping drastically help with the technology? I agree that a stable price (steadily growing) is what bitcoin needs to succeed. Price continuing to fall hurts the technology. If it’s low enough, miners won’t have the incentive to mine, etc. 
Putting $1,000USD in and it being worth $100USD now does not help technology. So that’s where I fail to understand all these posts about “yay this thing I bought for more usd is worth less now!” What would be good for bitcoin and the technology growth is if its value related to fiat was growing at a steady ~10% per year.

Press F for respect 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:30:14
This guy is fucked
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:11:52
Because if he posted it earlier it would just be his opinion verses other people’s opinion. Not fact. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:42:28
Aren’t you suppose to buy it when it’s high, and sell it when it’s low??
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:40:04
I’m thinking about buying a full bitcoin when it hits 1,800 
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:55:14
Price is never irrelevant. If you spent $20,000 a year ago you could get about 1 bitcoin. If you bought it at today’s price you could get 6 bitcoin. Say it drops to $1k in a year and you could get 20 of them. 
In 10 years if price goes up, the 6 bitcoin would be 6x more valuable than 1 bitcoin. And the 20 bitcoin would be about 3x more valuable than 6 bitcoin. 
Price is never irrelevant.

Weird flex but ok 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:22:46
Honestly still not cheap. I bet it continues to sink in 2019. Or until the general public forgets about bitcoin and will only get brought back up years later when/if there is some big technological advancement. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:29:50
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:53:08
I don’t get what you mean by this? Of course he waited until year end to post this.... 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:04:03
I don’t get this. Why you all the crypto fanatics act like it’s a good thing the value has dropped 80%. Fanatic? Or lunatic?
