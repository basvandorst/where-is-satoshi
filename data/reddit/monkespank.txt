How about ads payout small amounts of Bitcoin? Maybe have a micro wallet that pays out when you reach a set limit.

Recently bought a domain name at namecheap using bitpay. The bitpay transaction took less than a minute and I didn't have to risk sending out my credit card info. Not that I ever had problems online shopping with a credit card I just felt safer doing a BTC transaction.

My only point is that having freedom to do or not do something doesn't excuse you from liability. If your freedom of choice causes harm to someone else. I have the freedom to drive my car but should I cause damage to someone else I am liable. Same if I decided not to vaccinate myself against measles and caused an outbreak I should be held liable.

You pay hospital bills or whatever expense someone might incur as a result of getting sick.

Just fyi. Law and Order SVU recently aired an episode where a guy was about to stream a live kidde porn show and told the viewers to get their credit cards and bitcoins ready.

Sooner or later a small percentage of the population will end up with a large percentage of the wealth. This has always been the case since the beginning of money. Anyone who thinks wealth will ever be distributed evenly is living in fairy tail land.

Sometimes just the possibility of being prosecuted is enough. I agree that it would be tough if not impossible to determine patient zero of an outbreak. Plus insurance companies should be free to  refuse coverage to anyone not vaccinated which would be a another good incentive. People change their ideals quickly when it effects their pocket book.

If I own a majority of the world's wealth and never let go of it how can you ever be as wealthy as me unless we fight and you win taking all my wealth? Most of us squabble over crumbs while someone else is holding the whole cake.

If you cause someone else to get sick/die you should be held financially responsible at a minimum. Also medical insurance should be allowed to charge you a higher premium if you choose not to vaccinate.

I don't assume I know. There are only so many resources in this world and who ever has those is in control. So unless you have a really big army or you control the world's resources at some point someone else will end up with your money no matter what form it may take.

I use it for buying stuff online whenever possible. Credit Cards are so outdated and insecure (Banks are paying for losses so you won't cancel your card.) If anything I hope Bitcoin becomes the main currency of the internet. And I also have some btc, ltc in cold storage in case they go to the moon.

I used purse before. Usually less than a week but that could vary depending on when the item ships and when the user you are getting the bits from release's them. Basically I turned a 25$ Amazon gift card into 12$ worth of Bitcoin after I paid for shipping which I didn't realize at the time wasn't included. If you can buy Amazon gift cards with cash in your country then you wouldn't need a credit card.

Tails now has the option to disable all networking at the startup screen under the more options. It's all the way at the bottom. Literally just one mouse click and it is disabled until you reboot. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:32:21
Since tails now comes with electrum. I just use a USB with presistence enabled and keep my offline wallet on the usb. You can even disable network on startup now just to be safe. It's a lot cheaper than having a computer dedicated holding your private keys.

I use a prepaid phone that I top off with bitrefil. I've bought computer parts from thinkpenguin. Also paid for a domain name and email address with name cheap. Steam accepts bitcoin which I have bought several games. Best part is no one of these businesses have any of my credit or bank info and in some cases they don't have my name or address. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:44:44
Have no idea how to go about doing so but I've heard you can contact some of the bigger mining farms for large transaction like you are asking. Definitely check local laws most countries have laws against things like that hence the 5k to 10k limits you see.

Your phone is somehow compromised by a virus or malware and the private keys in mycelium are stolen. I admit not likely but still possible. If we are talking thousands of dollars in BTC then a hardware wallet,air gapped computer, or even a paper wallet (made with an offline generator and "dumb" printer) Would be the safer way to go. That being said I personally think mycelium is safe and have had over a thousand dollars worth of BTC on my mycelium wallet and didn't lose a minute of sleep.

Price was the same. The transaction went through within a minute or two I didn't have one confirmation and my account still was credited. Even had a game I couldn't get to work on my computer and received a refund shortly after contacting support.

Any gay porn sites that take Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-08 12:36:08
They won't because everyone in my family rolls their eyes at me when I bring up Bitcoin.

A USB WiFi adapter from thinkpenguin.

If you use too much cash they call the police cause you might be a criminal or terrorist? Sounds familiar.

Visa knows that credit cards are insecure and pays for theft so people won't cancel their cards because visa makes an obscene amount of money off of credit cards. See [Adam ruins everything.]( He explains it quiet well.
