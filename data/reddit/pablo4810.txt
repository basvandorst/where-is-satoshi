That's a joke? Most countries elect their leaders and have laws and rules in place to make everyones lives somewhat fair. Religious leaders(all religions) follow laws from a book of some made up nonsense written 1000s of yrs ago.
Exactly the same.

"Islam is based on fair play between rich and poor"
As long as both parties are Muslim. If you are poor and non Muslim you are less than a 2nd class citizen.

Filter those results by poverty and not race and you'll probably get a bit of a different picture.

Have we even reached anger stage?
I don't think we've seen a capitulation stage.

Thanks for the reply. I got started on coinbase, verified my ID, but it's not accepting my card. Not sure what it is.
