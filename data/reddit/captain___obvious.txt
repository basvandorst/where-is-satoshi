Except the whole "Democracy" is a terrible thing.
Just look at reddit's front page to see what mob rule and voting brings.  Cats, lots of cats.

point taken. I guess if it was my money I would pay taxes, not wait for the IRS to specifically create a ruling for bitcoin.

Didn't realize that, my experience comes from the mid 80s (i'm old)

It can't become a currency until it stops rising in price (deflationary).  No one in their right mind will purchase anything with a bitcoin right now (if the price is going up 50% per day, why would you use one??)

bitcoin = transformers
litecoin = gobots
bitcoin = legos
litecoin = megabloks

also wouldn't just by the nature of bitcoins, be a record of this transaction?  Will the government ever be able to link a wallet to a person?

They aren't mad at Mt.Gox, they are mad they lost money.  If for some reason they were locked out and the price of BT in USD went up to $300/BT then no one would be complaining.

if you are are taking tax advice from a random person online, you deserve the fines or audits you receive

Most people here doing bitcoins weren't old enough to remember the dotcom crash.
Remember, two rules:
1) It's not real unless you cash out and have it in the bank.   
2) Never, ever,  mess with the tax man.  
Other than that enjoy this runup!  I hope everyone here makes a ton of money on this--Myself, I'm a bitcoin thousandaire.  Knowing my luck I'll ride it all the way up and then all the way down.  :)

lol, you are actually suggesting to not pay taxes on gains?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:54:26
no idea where you can live on 1 million from the interest. (possibly 3% at a super safe investment)

Haha, this looks just like gas prices.  
Do you remember when they spiked up and everyone freaked out.  Now they are almost $4/gallon and people aren't complaining about anything.
