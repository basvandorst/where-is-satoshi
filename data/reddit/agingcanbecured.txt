"hackers"  
Anyone who knows how to use anything above the technology level of an abacus is a hacker to them.

Was thinking I'd be able to just exchange altcoins at marker value. No profit for either party.  
For example, I want to trade BTC for ETH and someone else wants to trade ETH for BTC so we're a match, and we'd trade, and that would be it.  
As far as speed goes, I don't mind waiting as long as I know approximately how long I'll have to wait so I can plan for it.

What kind of wait times are there usually?  
I posted a BTC/ETH trade at actual market value and it sat there all night with nobody going for it.  
I also initiated a sell transaction (unrelated to the BTC/ETH post) and have been waiting for the buyer to pay for about five hours.

Coincidentally, I was trying shapeshift.io for the first time right around the time you posted your comment.  
It worked out great.  
Thanks very much for the recommendations and additional info. I'll check out Changelly as well.  
I just noticed that bisq charged me nearly $5 in 'maker and tx fees' for every offer I posted, even though I ended up removing them all anyway. I don't think I'll be using bisq again unless it turns out to be better than localbitcoins for electronic fiat trading, or turns out to be the only way to trade for certain obscure altcoins.

Thanks, that's very helpful info.  
Really wish it were running smoother since it's such a great idea, though the posting fee (which is kept even if you remove your post) is disturbing.  
It's also disappointing that no one on there is trading at market value. They're all trying to make a profit. :/

Who's hosting these videos? 
Cuz they don't play on half of my devices.
Is it is hosted directly by reddit?

What's sad is that your average person who reads a comment like that is going to think the guy sounds like he's got a Master's in business and really knows his stuff.  
  
I wonder if there's an official term for that yet; a term to describe a person who appears to have an in-depth technical understanding of something when they're actually just a moron.

Everyone under 20 has no idea what you're talking about.

Did you just assume the year?
