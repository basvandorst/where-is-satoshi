Sold at $15214 this morning. I guess I should have waited a few hours. Hopefully a swift correction will come.

how is it a virus link? I've been using this website for about a year now. If you have a way for me to prove otherwise, let me know!

You should put an led display on the rear windshield to show the current price of bitcoin.

I still made  decent return, but not $18k a coin return.

Looks like your out of luck unless you have one of the devices that it was used on and the program is still installed.

i see that now. thanks

That's so true. I wish people wouldn't through all their eggs into one basket, but right now it seems to be like the best basket to do it with if you're going to.

That would be nice as long as it recovers.

Was it on Android or Apple? If it's Android, I know for sure you can check your previous downloaded apps. Yeah I'm sure you've download a ton of apps since 2012, but what's a few hours of your time if you have some amount of bitcoin in it. Then just do your best to guess the sign in info.

Yup. At least right now bitcoin is the wisest of all the dumb choices they could make.

Someome posted a website that would give a feed of the current prices a few days ago (either on r/Bitcoin or r/litecoin I can't remember which), but you should be able to pull it from his site and use an arduino or something to display it on an led panel. I might try to get something working for you.

I didn't see the no referral links. Simple mistake. I'll message the mods if I have to.

Kinda ghetto but it works

So many people have been gelded. I'm guessing some kind stranger is particularly glad to have it hit 10k

Based off your information, I've developed an algorithm for finding what it'll take to double up ones bitcoin.
        
        n x 2 = 2n where n is the initial investment of bitcoin and 2n will yield the value at which ones initial investment will be doubled.
