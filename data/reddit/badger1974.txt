That's good but do they know you're purchasing Bitcoin or have they simply not found out yet?

Thanks. I'll check out Nationwide.
Cash is probably the best if I decided to sell some bitcoin. However, that's opening up all sorts of different kettles-of-fish in relation to money laundering and requirement to be FCA compliant as a money transfer agent. Sighh.. is it really worth it?  Maybe I should just stick to good old fashioned cash &amp; plastic until BTC becomes mainstream.

Yea, I get it. Just unfortunate :

I'm starting to think he based it on stuff he'd heard on the media. I contacted Barclays through their webchat system on their website and the person I spoke to initially said there was no problem with purchasing bitcoin using funds from a Barclays account. When I said what the local branch had said he changed his mind and said that's down to the individual branch and I should follow their guidance. 
It's crazy. There must be a department that assesses potential account abuses and has the ability to lock and unlock them. What I need is the guidance from them rather than sales staff who don't know the realities.

Thanks. I looked at buybitcoins.sg and that is my alternative, to just use cash to buy them. It's a shame it costs £4 per transaction plus 8% commission on an undisclosed exchange rate (maybe BTC-E or Mt.Gox or Bitstamp or A.N.Other). 
If I use BitStamp directly is only 0.5% commission so 50p on £100 if I've understood it correctly.
My local takeaway takes bitcoin with a small discount for not using plastic but it's pointless if it costs an extra £11 to change up £100 in the first place.

For the person who asked why I mentioned it in the first place (then deleted the post)...
For a start, to fund my account means transferring funds using an IBAN code to Slovenia. That in itself is going to ring some alarms bells on a brand new account. I could use LocalBitcoins or BitBargain but they require direct bank transfers to individual accounts and, again, it's going to raise alarm bells when I'm not using my account for "normal" purposes like salary, groceries etc. 
It should not have to be done on the sly.

No, not at all trolling. Bought some alt-currencies in December then thought it a good idea to better understand how they work. Been reading 
Just saying that it's unfortunate for anyone on this side of the Atlantic that the term used is nonce. I've been trying to read it differently like "nounce" so I can read a sentence without part of my brain hearing the word paedophile.
I guess it's be similar (though not nearly so bad) as if we'd created it and used "ass", "kitty" or "hooters" as one of the variables.
Here's to our differences :-)
