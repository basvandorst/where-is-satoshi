It's not fully legal. Federal law says it's illegal, and federal law by extension overrides state law. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 08:04:55
Nah probably not.

Actually they will just continue to take cash because they can. Why bother with the extra bookkeeping nightmare of bitcoin when you can just demand cash and everyone will meet your demand? 
It's the same reason why landlords won't take credit cards for down payments or rent payments, they can demand cash therefore they do. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:04:18
But WI h credit cards you get the money back if it's stolen, whereas with bitcoin you get nothing back if stolen.

Almost every professional invests in some capacity, usually in the form of a 401k.

This is complete bullshit, bitcoin is massively too unstable to do what you describe.

Your going to get a real kick when you realize that white people basically own the American southwest lol.

Gold is a horrible store of value though unless you can afford to sit on it indefinitely, similar to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 02:48:33
Brainwallets are inherently faulty because the whole concept relies on low entropy passwords. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 05:31:18
Yah like I said you have to be able to hold indefinitely. Like right now good is doing horrible.

Honest question, I have a small amount of bitcoin I bought through coinbase. 
* Should I not have it in coinbase
* How would I go about storing it offline?

I don't understand, I am asking to learn. You are saying you know a better way. I am open to it. Please teach me.

Of course I will, I prefer as little human suffering as possible. Hopefully someday we can fix the scarcity problem and move on to socialism in a pure sense, but right now I think the system most European countries have is ideal at the moment. A capitalist economy with a socialist redistribution of wealth for certain items seems best. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:04:41
So are we assuming it's going to stay at $1,000 forever now? You guys don't think all the recent buzz from the news, CNN, the senate etc is giving it a temporary raise in value? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:17:07
Unfortunately that doesn't work on the scale of an Economy like America (or really any government). Without no new money coming in, especially as old money is lost or hoarded in large quantities, the system destabilizes. Bitcoin is ultimately doomed to failure because it doesn't scale well. I don't think a deflationary currency is something that will really take off in the long run, but maybe I am wrong. So far whenever that's been tried it failed.

User bitcoinbillionaire handed out several thousand dollars worth in tips to random people on this thread. Some dudes just randomly got gifted $3,000 USD.  I'm pretty sure he is like the new batman.

Towards what end though?  Capitalism reduces poverty, improves quality of life, and keeps fed more people than any other economic system. What would you rather take its place? And how will you feed yourself in the interim? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:12:03
So you just hate capitalism but don't have any suggestion as to what would be better, and you refuse a rational discussion on the topic and have nothing to put forth but one liners displaying the lack of thought you've put into this. Got it. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:34:42
Would have to do it very slowly, there is a $1k per day limit on most exchanges. Can be done easily though, just can't do it overnight.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:40:07
So wait science and objective fact is propaganda now? You realize that by working for money you are engaging in capitalism right? 
Can you share your "better idea"  now? I've spent the last 6 comments trying to understand what your better idea is but you refuse to reveal it so I can only assume it doesn't exist. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:34:07
No actually it is not even remotely close to the definition of a ponzi scheme. 
They are not using new investors to pay out old ones. Rather, for security reasons there is a limit to how much BTC can be withdrawn at one time, this helps bring stability to the market as people don't sell and buy instantly. It takes a week just to be verified to even buy any nowadays as well. 
You are free to take your ball and go home anytime though, you just can't take out $50k at once through one wallet. A smarter way would be to split the money up amongst several wallets and withdraw it that way. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:24:31
Awesome thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:24:53
It is much more than just owning the means of production. I will quote Wikipedia :


Regulation etc varies as there are so many different brands of capitalism from laissez faire to more heavily regulated systems like that of America or Europe. 
Anyways, continue your argument.

Paying for services rendered to you is way better than living in a nanny state where the government steals most of your money and uses it to censor your whole world.

People would rather support someone selling something they want in bitcoin vs fiat, but support does not mean buying every advertisement posted to this sub. Some people just don't want what advertisers are selling.

People aren't going to spend their money on things they don't want, regardless of whether you accept Bitcoins or not. Most people are hoarding BITCOINS right now anyways as they are gaining value by the hour so why spend them and lose all that purchasing power?

Deflation is worse than inflation.

Out of curiosity, why would someone with actual skill work for "pennies on the dollar"? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:19:44
Of course it's possible, just exchange it at Mt gox or BTC - e
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:54:08
No one wants to use their bitcoins right now. Why spend $100 last week when that same amount of bitcoins is worth $200 this week? 
Anyone spending bitcoins while it's inflating like this is noble but ultimately not very wise with their money. 
Imagine if we paid for things in gold, and then suddenly gold starts doubling in value every 6 months. Any smart person abstain from spending and hoards that gold. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:59:27
It's a fact though, it's far from perfect but has done the most measurable good of any system. If anyone trades their labor in exchange for compensation, it's capitalism. I don't see how you could disagree with that. 
Do you have any rebuttal or will you just down vote and laugh without suggesting any alternative. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:17:45
As someone new to bitcoins, do you think now would be a good time to invest in some or is the price artificially high due to its recent publicity a d what happened with silk road? I'm still kicking myself for not buying several years ago.
