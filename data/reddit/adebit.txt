Best scenario would be if no one argues against new developer's hardfork.
But as I said in YouTube comment:  miners are not the only necessary people to update - except for miners, nodes are important too. When Bitcoin just begun, 1st year there was no mobile or web wallets, so the only type of wallet was a Win32 program called **Bitcoin Core** which was maintained and developed by Satoshi Nakamoto and Gavin Andersen (main developer assigned by Satoshi Nakamoto those days). 2 years later Satoshi disappeared from forums and Gavin (public person) kept working on project, new mobile wallets appeared and mobile SPV wallets which has a difference from Bitcoin Core that you don't have to download the whole blockchain (45 gb today afaik).
Without nodes there's no way for miners to request information in blockchain, the same way you can't download a movie over torrent if there's no seeds. Basically nodes are like seeds in torrents and in fact download the blockchain in a similar way. 
But when your phone receiving someone's payment to your Bitcoin address, here's the way it happened:
- There's a list of unconfirmed transactions consisting all payments happened since last block (usually it is a transactions for last 10 minutes, because blocks are coming every 10 minutes)
- This list is created by nodes. Those nodes are collecting those transactions from all computers, all smartphones, even if you managed to write a program that sends transactions on 10 year old outdated Symbian smartphone with 128megabyte memory on SD card, this smartphone can sign and send those payments to the network.
- If you have bitcoins you can spend them by broadcasting everyone message
- So every computer globally gets that list, everyone has the same version on which transactions appeared on the net for the last 10 minutes.
- If 1 node gathered a list of 500 transactions, while neighboring node gathered 800 transactions, then node is going to synchronize with that node to add missing 300 transactions, but before adding those 300 list and pass it to other nodes, that node is going to check with blockchain whether the transaction is valid - by checking the balance of sender through blockchain, by checking if the transaction is belongs to the owner (every single transaction in bitcoin has a signature generated by owner, and this signature can be checked by anyone without revealing private key of the owner)
- When new block comes, all unconfirmed transactions become confirmed and being included to a global ledger

1st channel is the biggest channel in Russia, and they almost never talk about bitcoin, its the same way huge as CNN in U.S. except for the part that they are not talking about Bitcoin at all.
So this video is exclusive, because it represents that Russian TV cares about Bitcoin.
