So far there's a general impression from miners of "we want bigger blocks but don't really like BIP101 so if we had to choose we'd go with BIP100 but would rather something better".
Part 1 of Scaling Bitcoin (I posted it here) features developers with BIP101 testnet data from jtoomin (hope i spelled that right), another developer (forgot name, sorry!) IBLT proposal, weak block proposal, Peter Todd discusses big blocks and the Great Firewall of China, and other cool stuff.
The next developer panel will have more proposals.
It's worth the watch but no  consensus, also keep in mind that decisions aren't made at the conference.

Well if the *economic* majority relies on &gt;1MB blocks, then most of the value would be in those blocks, no? So would hashers switch pools in the interest of Bitcoin, ultimately changing the majority?
I'm not convinced this situation would ever actually happen so this might be getting too theoretical.

It will be voluntary but there's no guarantee that a miner will mine your transaction. Most nodes have a minimum fee they relay as well.
@_date: 2015-12-02 16:51:32
I don't think that should be a problem. You'd just have to make sure you forward the relevant ports if you want your node to operate as a full node.

So I think your removing defaults idea is an interesting idea, and not terribly difficult to implement. There's one trade-off though and that's the fact it'll be harder for newbies to get setup. I believe this will result in many people getting their defaults from another centralised location anyways.
If the issue is ignorant people not making informed decisions, I think it'll be hard to fix that. Perhaps software that generates a config file and asks what the user wants in semi-layspeak could be a solution. This isn't an uncommon practice, what would be your opinion on that?

For the lazy, you'll find:
1. Circle-jerking anti-content (more hateful than buttcoin IMO which comes off as more sarcastic)
2. Pro XT and BIP101, but nothing new regarding these two. Just the same threads.
3. Absolutely vicious comments and downvotes lunging at anyone who isn't 100% for XT. It's to a comical level even.
The owners of those communities will soon realise that without moderation the sub is really shitty. Almost like moderators have a real non-arbitrary role.

Seriously though. This isn't a good reason to show score, this is a horrible reason. I came here to comment "then you're a shitty journalist".
That'd be like saying I don't know what pull request I should ACK/NACK next because I can't see what score the other ACK/NACKs have. We have a huge issue with not enough journalists reporting facts and apparently it's because they rely on Reddit comments of all things.

Wait a minute. See here:
Click the TX, read "fee per kb". You didn't pay THAT low a fee. Let me figure this out.

You can restore with probably any BIP44 wallet. Copay is another good one I haven't seen mentioned yet.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:00:26
Try closing Bitcoin Core, and running it with "-zapwallettxes=1 -rescan". This should eliminate the TX from the wallet (and any others) and rescan your wallet after (I'm not sure if that part's necessary or automatic or what).
Edit: Also backup your wallet before messing with it.

I really like technology so I spend almost all of my time studying. I need/use programming a lot to accomplish what I want :p.
I'll make sure to send you a PM of whatever I get done! I'm going to first see if I can add in RPC calls to give me any more control (modifying Bitcoin Core), and I'm also going to make an external tool that tries to give a few high-level features with or without the RPC mods.
This will allow you to resend a TX using the exact same inputs using the wallet features of Bitcoin Core. There's no guarantee the network will accept it (as it *is* a double-spend), but it'll be way better than nothing. The tool will verify that you're using the exact same input(s), so you won't risk losing anything at all if the double-spend fails.
I also haven't looked but to just resend a TX with a higher fee I'm assuming something already exists. I just haven't heard of it, I usually just hear "it's possible".
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:23:37

I feel like before a lot of comments would get voted based on score. I also believe a lot of people didn't take lower score comments as seriously, and skim them, making it harder for good comments to get popular (one of the "best" comments right now is replying to a mod saying they do exactly that, and that's why they want it back).
There's been brigading, regardless of whether people believe it or not. This will make it much harder to brigade as people have to actually read the comments and can't easilly observe a divide anymore. I don't believe most brigading is intentional but instead a result of people's failure to read and understand the Reddiquette.
In the past I've thought hiding score is stupid. On this sub, right now I think it's a good temporary measure. Now if 24 hour hidden score becomes permanent well, I might have an issue with that.
I don't really see why anyone would have an issue because I believe this will make it easier for people to have discussions and vote based on merit, not popular opinion or score. I think it's good to shake things up for now.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:06:05
It's the latency in uploading and propagating the network that contributes to orphan rates, correct? I'm of the understanding that the entire reason China can't compete is because of the GFC. Well, with more than 50% of the mining in China, they don't have to. We'd have to compete to try to get our blocks propogated to them, no?
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:52:37
Try waiting 2 days, if it's still not confirmed alert me and I'll walk you through it. As the TX is more likely to be confirmed than I thought, I think you should play it safe and wait a bit before you go sending more TXs.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:37:31
Okay if you click the links from the bot you'll see most explorers don't see the TX.
So I guess your node is trying to broadcast it but most nodes are rejecting it. I'd still do zapwallettxes and rescan, then try to resend if you can (rescan will either pick up the TX or it won't).
Edit: Or you can wait 33 hours and see if it works.
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:31:36

This is a good rational thought. At the end of the day, the people doing the hashing will vote by hashing for the pools they think are best.
I think these announcements are good because it (hopefully) makes it more clear to the people who act like core devs are the only ones against BIP101, that that's totally not the case.

So, if we, as a community recommend people to not only use one centralised payment processor, they wont?
Google used goats to mow their lawn.


It's an opinion unless you can prove it. There's no "truth" right now. I'm not 100% read up on LN but on a technical level I really don't see how it'll be centralised.
I see how it has the ability to be centralised ... But it's still always less centralised than all micropayment options we have right now. It's also less expensive. It also reduces blockchain bloat.
What are the disadvantages compared to what we have now? What's an alternative, better proposal? To me, LN seems like a logical direction. When me and a friend brainstormed solutions to scaling, we came up with a very primitive version of LN, before we knew about LN.
Regardless of how you think the user side of things will be, it's a massive open-source project. If there's massive demand for a logical, more user-friendly option, it'll be written.
Hell, I plan on writing tools that utilise the shit out of LN. As a developer I'm absolutely ecstatic to potentially get the control out of Bitcoin I've always wanted.
@_date: 2015-12-06 22:50:36

Optional RBF isn't implemented yet :p. 0.12.0!
To rebroadcast a TX that never reached any nodes that you sent using your wallet, you need "-zapwallettxes=1" and "-rescan".

Bitcoin core is capable of not running as a full node. It could easily be a leech node, just set maxconnections to &lt;8 I believe.

Actually, do you know what your minRelayTxFee is? I'm not sure if your node will relay the transaction if you have that set too high.
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:32:58
I have a calculator that estimates between 10 and 33 hours. Please let me know how it goes so I can use that information to improve it.
Edit: minRelayTxFee is 0.00005 by default in 0.11.2 and 0.00001 on most other versions. You're 1/10^th of the common minimum.
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:25:44
You can rent a cheap VPS that'd run a Bitcoin node for $50 or less per year if you look. I think that's reasonable.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:23:52
My zapwallettxes reply will get rid of it. Until optional RBF (replace by fee) is added sadly the only option is to wait. I don't believe your TX actually got broadcast though so waiting won't solve it.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:15:22
Right but right now, merchants, especially anything working with micropayments (all gambling sites, mobile games, etc) use some sort of payment processor, usually a centralised one. That, or they keep all your funds in their wallets. They run with our Bitcoins all the time, people post horror stories and they're sad to read.
LN gives us more control over how much we explicitly trust to them, which CLTV ensuring our funds' safe return if anything goes wonky. We simply don't have that now.
As I said before I see how LN has the capability of being centralised but so does mining, and so does payment processing as it stands today. LN won't be the only option to process payments with, merchants are people just like you, they'll go with whatever they want, some may even offer multiple options.
The way I see it LN is an optional payment method that's better than what we have right now, with no better proposed alternative.

Except most people here can apparently tell me the context offhand (and no one has, you haven't), and don't have to spend an unknown amount of minutes-hours researching it. On a look, all I learned is Roger Ver had a conflict with the bitcoin.com domain and "other conflicts". To what depth I don't know and how it relates to this video I know even less.
It's not a fair trade. Someone on IRC told me Roger Ver owns blockchain.info, which from my experience has the worst support (at least the worst I've ever dealt with). So I'm still no closer to even remotely understanding why people are siding with him for something.

Okay, Reddit will decide what they want (and so far it looks like they want this). The title is completely misleading though as this data is only Purse.io, and the data doesn't conclude anything at all without more data (min/max prices, price reduction by % and value, quantity of sales, etc). All this seems to conclude is "people buy more things on Black Friday". An example would be awesome infographics for games I've seen around (for Blizzard games at least) which makes sure to demonstrate the data in a meaningful way.
Basically I understand how the numbers definitely help show what I might want to buy next, they don't show me any meaningful data related to Bitcoin though. I don't like ads on here.
One last thing, I'm assuming the state names aren't supposed to be nearly invisible? As a non-American, that map doesn't mean much to me without names :p.

Is anyone still vocally in favour of BIP102 over other proposals? I ask because I haven't ever really heard it discussed recently.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:21:13


I sincerely believe that could be over 100 years from now, and I also believe it'd be a sign we need smaller denominations (either way, I dont believe relevant in the anywhere near future). Using satoshi instead of bits is approximately as annoying as using cents instead of dollars. It's not as much arbitrary as convenient. If we can't divide value low enough, Bitcoin will have to accommodate that somehow (or have it's use-cases limited).


But most communication is done in BTC and uBTC/bits. If anything the very few that use satoshi to represent balance add more confusion as most wallets have their smallest denomination in bits.
I believe strongly in pushing bits as the common standard. It's common enough that people say "bits" instead of "uBTC". You have a good argument, but I do feel like satoshi is more confusing/inconvenient/annoying for representing value.
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:07:00
Just ignore the XT trolls, they aren't worth your time. Anyone who thinks it makes any sense for Bitcoin to scale entirely off of blocksize is completely uninformed or trolling.

My comment wasn't meant to be read as "people should only use VPSs", nor was it written that way.
@_date: 2015-12-06 16:36:58
It'd be better to watch the video [here]( to get a full impression on how the individual miners feel about the proposals. A *very* basic summary though:
- BIP101 increases the blocksize limit too aggressively.
- BIP100 gives too much control to the miners (not all miners agree on this point), and it's too easy for some miners to force a low limit.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:05:24
Only in certain threads. I find if it's anything that could possibly be spun as "an issue", that'll bring out the XT trolls.
I've watched comments drop from 40+ to less than 20 over an hour, and crawl back up over days. I really hope this change stops that stuff.
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:44:25
I never said it was. The other commenter put up a straw-man and pretended I did though. On the point of a working proof of concept, I believe a couple people have proof of concepts on Github.
Also I have a feeling you didn't mean to word your comment that way. You have a double negative there ;p.
Edit: Also LN being a solution at this exact moment is completely irrelevant and off-topic. It doesn't matter, I never claimed once that it was ready.
@_date: 2015-12-15 04:05:34
Well you could look around to see if there's any data about how many blocks are mined per year. Should be around 52560 I believe. Regardless if it's at least somewhat consistent year-to-year, you should be able to semi-accurately figure out how many blocks you'd need to wait for, until X amount of time passes.

@_date: 2015-12-03 13:31:17
Lightning Network devs have stated they'd ultimately need bigger blocks, and therefore a larger blocksize limit in the future as Bitcoin stands today.
Don't worry, if we don't find a way to reduce the size of blocks soon, the limit will go up. If I ever see the blocksize average pushing the ceiling more than any sane amount, I'll also push for an increase (probably not BIP101 though).
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:14:02
Basically your TX is sent to other nodes who see what you tried to do and acknowledge it, and also relay it to other nodes. Eventually it gets to some miners and every 10 minutes they include a bunch of TXs into a block, confirming their legitimacy forever, that's your first confirmation. Each block that's mined on top of that block is another confirmation. I believe right now Bitcoin Core considers your TX "confirmed" after 6 blocks.
Edit: Fixed outright wrong parts.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:21:39
To me, that only makes sense if there's a majority outside of China though, otherwise it'd have to be a huge initial push to change that.
Do you happen to know what % of hashing power is in China? Or have a link to that data? It'll be hard to estimate who's right without those numbers.

11 hours? Ouch, I did a ~22 bit/KB TX and it took 5 hours.
It definitely got broadcasted, it just seems like most nodes don't see it.
Edit: I'm going to work on a tool that respends a TX with a higher fee. It seems handy for personal use and it's something you could use right now (idk if it'll be useable in time for you though :p).
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:35:52

Not only should merchants expect some sort of wait to make it on the block chain, but 0.00005 BTC is a very low fee. Most software I've seen has 0.0001 as the "normal" fee. RN 0.00016 - 0.0002 should confirm in about 1 block, also very low.

This wasn't a point either, they made no points...(maybe one at most).

I don't use the graphical client but I believe it has a "debug console" or something that allows you to enter RPC commands. I believe you just do "abandontransaction yourTXIDhere" then you're all set. That'll tell the wallet to ignore that transaction when figuring out what inputs it can use.
I believe it has some limitations like it can't be in your mempool but if it's not showing up on block explorers you should be good to go.

I know you've already been told you can wait a few days but you can skip that and try to use the "abandontransaction" RPC call (added in 0.12) if you'd like. It'll flag the transaction as abandoned and will allow you to use the inputs again.

If you haven't read into anything about /dev and what it's used for [the first two paragraphs hopefully clear that up](
Basically what the ideal scenario is, if you wanted to have a unified solution to incorporate both hw and sw devices, you'd use a service for sw/hw wallets and you'd have a /dev device for each hw wallet. This would make the universal standard to use the service and the low-level standard to interface with the wallet directly.
Also, how would you propose the SW wallets get listed under /dev? Would the wallets have to be installed under root? How would you handle this on multi-user systems?


I don't think so, I think a service would be better. I don't believe the system should care what a Bitcoin Wallet is.
As a raw device, Bitcoin wallets don't all follow a single unified standard, how would programmers be expected to interface with it? I think it'd be better left as a low-level thing.
RPC calls (mentioned earlier) seem to be the best method. If you want an example of a simple service/daemon you could connect to with telnet and mess around with install MPD (music player daemon).

Okay but if someone initiates 100 000 transactions with a client don't they have to store and keep track of all those keys? Wouldn't the cost on that be extremely low?
Edit: Or substantially more than 100 000, that's low balling it by maybe too much. I understand 100 000 wouldn't be a huge impact but what I'm saying is it doesn't seem like it would cost too much to make the client do work and fill up its storage.

That's entirely your opinion, people aren't against BIP101 for no reason. I'm certainly not satisfied that nodes won't become more centralised.

Edit: Oops, ignore that. I didn't notice you're the person I replied to. I'm tired.
I personally don't think it's a good idea to make solo mining even more expensive than it already is. Or to make running a pool more expensive for that matter. I don't think you're quite thinking about how long gigabyte blocks would take to upload, and the resources required to remain competitive. Bitcoin-NG solves that problem.
The point being is as much as this is a trivial concern to some, it's a major concern for others looking at the long-term future of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin-NG brings an idea to the table that can satisfy all the involved parties just a little bit more, I believe that's a step in the right direction.

You'd use an address key. For example your first address could be: "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0" and your second could be "m/44'/0'/0'/0/1". Address keys don't have chaincode in their keys (they're not xpub or xprv).
This indicates you're using BIP44 (44') with Bitcoin on the livenet (0'), under the first account (0'), using an external key (0), and using the first or second address (0 or 1).
Keep in mind you spend all the coins from an address, not a wallet. Nobody is aware of your wallet balance (unless you make it known), just each individual address as if they're unrelated.
I hope that clarifys things a bit. Maybe knowing what happens behind the scenes during a transaction would help?

Mycelium is a Hierarchal Deterministic (HD) wallet (BIP32/BIP44). Every time you receive a new transaction you get a new address. Funds sent to those addresses have no connection to each other (they can't be predicted without your xpub which should only be known to you). If you try to send all of your funds at once though, it merges all these unspent outputs you have into one transaction, making it pretty obvious you're in control of all those funds.
Basically if you want to transfer your wallet to another phone (and maintain any privacy you might have had) just import the master key seed provided to you by the app into another app.

What are the variables I need to take into account to figure out the cost of the attack? I'm just not understanding the costs as being particularly high.
To my understanding the transactions only need to get relayed not confirmed so I'd imagine the actual BTC cost to be quite low.
In terms of actual processing power I'm thinking of an SPV wallet running on an Android phone against someone with at the very minimum a decent rented server, and a total budget of less than $2000 USD.
Are there any public implementations of the code so I could just simulate the attack and put my mind at ease?

I don't mean to put you down but I think setting up a blockchain explorer is probably too big a task if you've never even setup a Linux server before o.o. Who knows though, maybe they're easier than I think.
If you want somewhere to start. Grab a Linux server or install Ubuntu server on whatever you plan on using. Then configure it to have working PHP and MySQL (This would usually be a LAMP configuration and there are many tutorials for this).
I'm hoping that would help out a little bit (unless Ubuntu does everything for you, which it might).
I looked up the source code for one of those, I'd definitely not recommend this to start unless you're willing to get stuck sometimes. I'd say this is "intermediate" level:  It's clearly written and if you understand it, it should be easy to follow. Just make sure you Google any questions you have, (like if you don't know how to create a postgreSQL db Google "how do I create a postgre database on Ubuntu server?") good luck!

@_date: 2015-11-05 14:14:47
I stopped reading at your "anyone who talks about keeping the crazy low blocksize is upvoted". That's not true, just because people aren't in favour of BIP101 doesn't mean they aren't in favour of BIP100 (and even more are opposed to XT for their own, other reasons). I haven't seen anyone since I've been here argue that the limit should remain unchanged and get upvoted.
I believe BIP101 to be too theoretical. It's sustainability is based on Gavin's claims of Bitcoin being able to handle the enormous limits when the time comes. To me, that sounds like too risky of a solution. If we were to aggressively push out a hardfork I believe BIP100 would gain consensus quickly anyways (it has/had 60% miner consensus IIRC?).
It's foolish to pretend everyone against BIP101 or XT are simply against increasing the blocksize limit.
Edit: My conclusion is I haven't observed brigading people in favour of the limit with upvotes, my above is likely why. It wouldn't make sense.

This clears things up a bit.
Should I cut the result of HMAC-SHA512 in half for a private key or (edit) just use HMAC-SHA256? This is of course, for single address only and not for a proper BIP-32 wallet.
Edit: I find my quoted paragraph in BIP-39 extremely confusing. Does the paragraph simply mean to say that **just** the derived key (from the seed) is 512 bits? Seems extremely confusing to keep that in a subsection about generating the seed if that's the case.
Edit2: If my previous edit is correct then I think the sentence about key length should be completely removed because the next sentence (to me) is way too confusing:




As that sentence is in a step about generating the seed and the very next sentence is about using the seed, I think mentioning the resulting size of the key there is just ... Silly? Shouldn't it be mentioned **after** the step about using the seed?
@_date: 2015-11-17 12:23:06
Usually you'd generate a BIP39 mnemonic, use that to generate your BIP32 HD wallet, and there's no need for a WIF. You'd reuse the BIP39 mnemonic if you wanted to generate the same wallet.
If you want to use a WIF I wouldn't recommend it for HD wallets. If you do end up doing it, keep change addresses in mind.
A WIF holds a single private key. Simply follow the steps on the wiki for converting a private key to WIF if you want a WIF for any of your HD keys. Again, I highly recommend against it.
Edit: And signing a transaction would be the same process as any other private key. Maybe read BIP32 to get a better understanding about what's happening behind the scenes.

Do you think smart contracts are sustainable as a sidechain though? The whole point of smart contracts is to make sure nobody can manipulate the rules in any way. With a sidechain it'd be significantly more vulnerable than the primary chain and then I'd rather use multisig or something.
Do you happen to know what method they're using / going to use to pass BTC to and from the sidechain?
How do they solve orphan rates with such fast blocks?
What's the miner's incentive?
I'm not convinced the security is on par with Ethereum. The website says it offers the same level of security as Bitcoin. Without anything to back that up I think that's outright lying. I'm not even convinced Ethereum is up to Bitcoin's level of security.
I'm not sure this solves any real issues other than BTC to Ether conversion (if that's even truely solved). Right now you can convert BTC to Ether and use Ethereum and I believe Ethereum will have more nodes/miners than a smart contracts sidechain for Bitcoin (just seems like an oddly specific almost no incentive thing to run to me).
Closing notes, this part of the website really worries me because the developers (or website designers) are either dishonest, don't really know what they're getting involved with, or genuinely know something I don't know and are choosing not to disclose for whatever reason:




1. How is a sidechain comparable to the security of the Bitcoin network? They're advertising performance gains, equivalent security, and more features. Why even be a sidechain then? Why would we use Bitcoin at all if it's better in every way? Unless all that was made up.
2. The fact that sidechains is plural is deeply concerning. I hope they're not planning on solving scalability or feature issues by using more sidechains. Instead of having one nice big secure blockchain we'll have the blockchain and Bitcoins fragmented all over different sidechains. Do you dare roll the dice and invest?
Honestly with Shapeshift I barely see the use for Sidechains.

I'd imagine the data block would get orphaned if it took longer than 10mins (but that's an incredibly long time assuming it doesn't need PoW). So you'd reference the keyblock from that miner but reference the last accepted data block (not necessarily from the last miner).
This is still a pretty big change because it's basically two chains. To me it does sound like a simpiler alternative to Bitcoin NG though.
Also this solution may fix orphan rates for scaling but it doesn't increase tx confirmation speed as much as Bitcoin-NG does.

1) I agree.

There are a finite amount of coins in Bitcoin, sooner or later most/all will be "dirty". So then what do we do, attempt to quantify taint? To what avail?

I feel like you understand most of what I'm asking.


I know, but IndieSquare has a single address mnemonic. I'm jumping into actually reading BIPs only just today so sorry if I'm unknowedgable to certain specifics.
Does BIP-32 support just single addresses? Is there a BIP that says what I'm *supposed* to do? I know I have a lot of options for what I can do but I don't care about those.


When you say a single address, do you mean one that's in an account that doesn't support further addresses being created? Because that's basically how an IndieSquare mnemonic when imported into CounterWallet shows up and it confused me.
I know that I could just create an account and a keypair for the external keychain and simply just not generate more addresses but another wallet implementation wouldn't know that this is what I want because HD wallets usually generate more addresses.




I'm not sure what you mean by "used as the room".
I understand I could do a lot of things with the words to generate many different private keys but they would be implementation specific. I'm talking about what's considered okay in Bitcoin, so more wallets are supported (for example I don't want some wallet to have to test for my random implementation of BIP-39 and have to reverse the mnemonic before sacrificing a goat and passing it directly as a private key).
Because we're talking about BIP-39, is converting the mnemonic to a seed not a required step?
IndieSquare does it and its mnemonic works on CounterWallet so all I'm asking is if there's a standard to what I'm asking or if these two wallets were coded to support eachother, ignoring standard specification.

Is it simply calling smart contracts unsafe? I'm really missing why RootStock and Ethereum are called out here.

Okay so it sounds like there's a lot of confusion here ... I'll try to decipher.


I'll have to read more about Trezor. Their devs actually wrote BIP 39. Are the addresses fine?


If the xpub is different but you're generating the same addresses you're looking at different xpubs. I'm assuming you want the master key but you may be looking at an account xpub or something.


Trezor probably gives you whatever key Mycelium wants, which is probably the master xpub. I don't know which xpub Mycelium wants though, maybe an Account?


All proper BIP 39 implementations should work with Trezor I believe. They shouldn't generate different keys, Trezor wrote the BIP.


If you're serious about this post in Just keep in mind a big point of BIP39 is to work across most implementations. If you're having problems it's likely a result of lack of understanding and the tools not being particularly helpful. It'd be largely redundant to have this made IMO.
If you're talking about the wallet formats that website supports BIP44 which is a pretty safe bet for most decent wallets in my experience. It even lets you input your own BIP32 format!

Not really, right now the big problem that's going on right now has to do with how many transactions Bitcoin can do per second (tps) while remaining secure and decentralized. In Bitcoin's current state, the blocksize limit keeps the max tps low. Bitcoin-NG increases the maximum tps, and effectively the blocksize (via "microblocks").
There are a few arguments against increasing the blocksize by a lot (BIP101). One being that big miners with good connections could be at an advantage. While another miner is trying to slowly push their solution, a big miner could theoretically upload their big block faster.
Bitcoin-NG solves this by keeping a keyblock with a small size and no txs stored in it. The miner who mines the keyblock now has the ability to release a microblock every 10s for the next 10mins containing validated transactions and no PoW.
Bitcoin-NG doesn't really solve the issue of increased node network requirements though.


Very little right now, I don't know the numbers, sorry. The 10mins and 1MB limit are in place partially to prevent issues like orphans. Changing either of those numbers would effect orphan rates.
With a blocktime of 1min you'd basically be murdering small miners and the stability of Bitcoin IMO. More miners would find solutions around the same time. Less miners would be able to keep up with validating transactions on time (with everything now happening so fast) so we'd likely see more empty blocks to avoid orphans (which brings us back to the original problem anyways).
Also it should be noted that NG does nothing for storage. All it does for network is shift all the traffic from one big chunk to lots of smaller chunks.
I actually like NG's idea a lot and I wish it was more practical to do something with.
Edit: Clarity.

BIP44 has support for multiple coins and Coinomi (Universal Bitcoin Wallet) on Android has the functionality built in. I'm not sure how I feel about including altcoins as part of a Bitcoin wallet though. Also if an attacker gets your master keys you lose all your coins from all the currencies.
My problem with altcoins is I just don't usually see the purpose. For convenience and to save on fees I don't want my value split into all kinds of different coins. If I believed the Bitcoin cryptocurrency wasn't the best cryptocurrency, I'd use a different one.
There's also the problem of them usually being less secure than Bitcoin regarding hashrate / miners / nodes.

Cool! Great explanation, you're definitely pushing me to support SolarCoin.
I'll be honest I tried to digest information very rapidly, in that time I read/process lots of contradicting information and try to sort it out. I mentioned spending incentives because IIRC the video only mentions solar energy companies getting the coin, not an individual's ability to obtain them on their own as well. Because of this, I was left thinking "If I owned an energy company and some random crypto foundation was sending me coins, I wouldn't know what to do with them".
Knowing that there will be billions of coins also helps, I was under the impression that there were going to be no more coins created. When I get a chance I'll try to figure out how I got so mislead so hopefully other people interested in the project don't fall into the same confusing trap I did.

I'm not 100% sure but this isn't a consensus change anyways. It's opt-in and it wasn't just thrown together haphazardly. Github has an okay format for people to discuss pull requests.
If you'd like I can look on the mailing list for discussion. Honestly every little thing that even could be discussed seems to end up there at some point. I'd be really surprised if the mailing list didn't discuss it, I just don't follow it closely.
Edit: It should be *stressed* that this isn't a consensus change. Some full nodes already run RBF and you'd never know, now with opt-in you can at least see beforehand if it can be replaced or not.
This still wouldn't stop other nodes from using their own implementation though. It's the freedom of Bitcoin.

I can simply derive addresses from an timestamp?

Yay! Always happy to find people driven and learning Linux.


It's true that a third party would maintain it, that is the case for all services (so I'm not sure where the issue is, but I'll attempt to tackle it anyways :p). SystemD would at least enable you to basically write it once, and it should work on all flavours of Linux though. So if you made a BIP for "Standardised Wallet Service for Linux" or something (idk if you'd even need / want a BIP), and supported a bunch of wallets out of the box, that'd probably achieve your goal (one standard to rule them all).
Just keep in mind everything is maintained by people, the kernel just allows people to use their own modules and junk and drop stuff in. If you made a well-designed third-party standard and got into some official repos, you probably wouldn't have too much trouble finding other maintainers.
Another thing to clear up is services don't necessarily need the kernel to be aware they exist at all. To oversimplify, they're basically just loops that take shutdown and restart commands. I can't think of a simple Linux example anymore (thanks SystemD ...), but if you look into starting daemons on startup in FreeBSD, you'll see very transparently how simple it all really is. Another option (less transparent IMO but effective for what you want to know) is if you Googled like "apache2 systemd service file" you can see how easy it is to make a service file that'd work on most Linux flavours.
Been a couple years since I've answered any Linux questions so I apologize if anything is not current.

You've failed to address ... Every single point and question OP has brought up I believe. Instead all I see is you simultaneously saying you're not a large company while at the same time gloating and stating you've had a great impact.
Good grief, if you're not a big company this shouldn't be a big issue. It may be an issue you can't solve but if all the communication involved here has been made public then Coinbase's response has been abysmal. Just talk to the man and address his points, all I see is a lazy reply as a result of a rough read.
1. Why wasn't OP notified sooner of the actual issue (which is still unclear)?
2. Why aren't you willing to work with OP in any way on the issue? (IE you barely even acknowledged OP was on the mark at all for the precieved problem, which is still unclear, and Coinbase has made no effort to resolve this)
3. [OP claims to have only been working with Bitcoin transactions]( what's the issue if that's the case?
To top it all off we **still** aren't even fully aware of the issue. OP was told it was a FinCEN issue, OP said that doesn't make sense. Coinbase made OP wait for days messaging Coinbase for a real response, OP asked if maybe it was an issue with banks, Coinbase gave OP the equivalent of a lengthy "maybe".
Horrible communication and support, I expected an apology from Coinbase and a resolution of the situation not the equivalent of "look, we're on the same side. I won't give you any details about why we can't help, but rest assured we've been helping a lot of people and are a great company". If this is how Coinbase conducts business, I imagine any good reputation you have left is temporary.

Like just for hardware wallets or like all wallets? I'm really struggling to think of any actual advantages for this change. Hardware (like a trezor, not like a chip on your MB or a PCI card) or software.
This change would basically make it so Linux has to have wallet libs to support all the wallets as opposed to Bitcoin having a universal standard and the kernel wouldn't have to know Bitcoin exists.
I believe you should just ship your flavour of Linux with your favourite wallet as a service. There's no real disadvantage to doing it this way. I can't think of much software that has it's own /dev device (do you count virtual terms and audio mixers?) and personally I think we should try to keep it that way.
The flipside to this argument would be if there were actual integrated Bitcoin / wallet chips that started shipping relatively standard in computers. Then you'd absolutely have your dream come true, and on more than just Linux.

If people are relying on 0-conf, they're going to get scammed sooner or later anyways. Especially if they're not updating their wallet software.
I've been following the Git, I think it's safe to say a lot of wallet developers are aware of the issue. The change isn't live yet, they have time. Some nodes already implement RBF.
It doesn't make sense to not have this change. Moving forward it makes sense. If Bitcoin always had this feature, the argument of "wallets might not implement it" wouldn't stand because it would be an obviously expected feature. We can't let some wallet devs or some irresponsible users be the reason to halt Bitcoin progress.
Edit: Guys, double spends are already very easy if you rely on 0-conf. You should already be taking all steps available to secure yourself if you choose to use 0-conf. Don't be irresponsible, you won't lose Bitcoins.
Edit2: My apologies. Easyness is relative, perhaps I'm wrong to say it's "very easy" but instead I'll say "likely possible".

I agree.


Uhh I disagree. Personally, I've found that I spend **significantly** less time looking for free, well designed software on Linux than I do on Windows.
The only Windows only program I can think of that I love is Glasswire and I'm sure there must be a Linux alternative. Games for the most part even run well on Linux now-a-days.
Maybe if the Windows 8/10 stores were actually useful I could see your point but they certainly don't compete with most Linux repositories. It's not 2005 anymore, Linux actually has massive hardware and software support.
Either way I prefer BSD so I don't care what people use.

How does this allow competitors to trust eachother? Do they all agree on certain private chain parameters and mine? What if one bank controls over 50% of the mining? How are the rules decided or enforced?
How is this better (or relevantly different?) than allowing all the banks to control one database and the richest few banks verify the validity of those transactions before becoming permanent, but allow all others to submit their own and read others?
Also how do private chains stay private? What's stopping someone from mining their blocks? Trusted miner list? How is that decided?

So SolarCoin left me confused. It doesn't help that their website is awful for information IMO there's more informantion on the Bitcoin Talk thread.
Their technical details links to their source code. I'm not taking the time to read all of it. 1/10 for that. I was actually really interested in those.
Less than $200 USD worth of SolarCoin traded in the past 24 hours. There doesn't seem to be any spending incentive, do they have plans in place to fix that? Also one of their most active users recently left due to frequent price manipulation.
Why are they only distributing 99% of the currency? Are they an energy company too? 1% is an awful lot to keep to yourself...

Having just read through that thread, I strongly encourage others to do so (and actually read BIP47) and form your own opinions whether BIP47 should be accepted in it's current state.
I don't think it should be, it doesn't read as well as BIP32 for example (though, the diagrams are cool, it defines payment codes twice for example) and its intent is to be deployed with an update in the near future to v2 (I don't know why it would be necessary for Core to include the BIP then if it's unfinished, I don't personally consider address reuse to be a real solution I'd expect to see in core). I'm disappointed at the writer's response to feedback.

It's true, that's absolutely how it works. BIP39 and BIP44 are still drafts even IIRC. The core devs have demonstrated that they'll only accept BIPs that they're 100% satisfied with. Some say that's a fault, others say it's an advantage.
I personally think it's great because if your BIP is successful as a draft it either won't matter because it's already popular or you'll iron out any potential hiccups before it hits core. Either way I don't see this as a significant hit for you, core obviously won't accept every BIP.
I understand you're frustrated by the BIP process (I don't have an opinion on it, I'll form one on another date), but I didn't feel like dismissing luke-jr's point that BIPs shouldn't be depending on existing software implementations was constructive. In fact, I didn't get a "moving forward" vibe at all. As an outsider, this is what I observed.
Edit: What I tried to say earlier was that releasing v1 is fine by me, and probably all of everyone else in the Bitcoin community. I just don't see a reason to have v1 accepted in core if it'll be changed later (a big change). I personally believe Core should at least try to remain consistent, not implement something new that will change in the near future.

Ethereum is basically built around smart contracts from what I could gather. I think smart contracts answers most of my questions. I'll just lay down a few more things I learned too.
The mining is done by Ethereum miners. Some things say it only supports CPU and others say it only supports GPU and CPU is not recommended, very confusing.
Anyone can make a new token on top of Ethereum's Ether from what I could gather. So like CounterParty and others for Bitcoin. I think they also support smart contracts though so you could do something like "if user_with_greatest_number_of_tokens then grantAdmin" at least I think that's the idea.
It seems to be basically built around smart contracts. Their goal seems to be to make it easier to build decentralised applications because the contracts are enforced by the network.
I think it'd be a lot of work to have something like this on Bitcoin so I'm actually pretty excited to see where Ethereum goes. I feel like it acts like it's further along than it is though and I believe that'll hurt adoption from both developers and users.

Well it's not uncommon to read stories of why people turned off their nodes, and for them to mention spam. It's not uncommon for people to ask why transactions are confirming slowly, people mention spam. People ask why fees are necessary at their current price, their told spam is the reason.
You say people don't get denied service because of an attack? I say you're wrong.




No they aren't, it's the whole reason we have the rules we have. Your entire argument with seemed to be him trying to explain to you why certain limits are in place and necessary. Also if you're arguing for nodes that decide to allow /all/ transactions then they're vulnerable to DoS attacks and could ultimately not be a benefit to the network in the event of such an attack.




Block size would either increase, or we'd see delayed transactions for one. We definitely won't magically scale immediately for sure. Transactions aren't free, they consume space and resources. They could end up with an enormous amount of transactions they need to process (easy to do with a DoS attack if the network allows everything), how could they possibly scale their hardware requirements to withstand a massive spam attack if they were expected to process all transactions?
Edit: Have you missed all the topics on Bitcoin scaling? We don't have arbitrary limits, we have very real limits we're dealing with.

DoS doesn't necessarily mean complete and total denial of service. Bitcoin has definitely suffered from DoS attacks in the past. If every spam transaction was allowed you would wait much longer for a single confirmation, or a relay even, denying you service for a period.
With enough spam other nodes could be pushed to capacity forcing the remaining nodes to handle the load. This could result in dropped or seriously delayed transactions.
Not to mention the effects of miners actually putting all those transactions into blocks.

The algorithm to calculate whatever the game uses (a deck, dice, whatever) is published publicly, the server generates half the seed, the client generates the other half (some let you specify it), then the result is calculated. Provably fair.

I don't understand. Mods are downvoted for explaining why someone was banned and if they don't explain it?
What exactly does the community want? I mean a post titled "All Hail Theymos" to me, sounds like a troll (or at least shitposting).

Not sure if this was a joke but it made me think "boy was I wrong!". Turns out I may have been double wrong (correct).
Anyways I decided to read BIP-39 (mnmonic passphrases) and BIP-32 (HD wallets) and from what I can tell BIP-39 generates a seed from words (not a seed specific to xprv or xpub, just a seed for BIP-32). BIP-32 takes that seed and generates the master xprv/xpub keys. I can't find (or think of a method in my head) a way to *just* generate an xpub key.

Thanks for clearing that up. I wasn't aware it worked that way.

I want to use Bitcoin to buy my coffee though.
Will lightning network lessen the impact of fees? I don't fully understand it but I believe you pay a fee to begin the transaction and another fee to close it. So you can do a lot of transactions in between?

I earned 65 coins and now I can't open the NativeX thing. The second option does nothing. Third option says I have no offers.
Is there a limit? I did one thing.
Edit: So it worked for a little while and I earned 405 coins. I cashed out 200 (for 800bits) but nothing happened. Apparently the bits will be emailed to me, I'm not sure what that means.
Edit2: I was supposed to get 800 bits, I got 624 bits. It earned pretty quickly anyways so that's great! I just wish it wasn't confusing while trying to earn (buttons unresponsive).
@_date: 2015-10-30 18:12:21


I wish it was that easy.


You'd still need to process a credit card transaction to actually purchase the Bitcoins. How do you figure you're removing any sort of "gateway"?

Yeah I remember someone having issues using Mycelium and Copay at the same time. I wonder exactly what the issue is because I can't seem to find a statement from Copay saying they use anything other than BIP44 (so maybe incompatibility is a bug?)

Is this news to some people? Do you have Rogers or Bell? You have the same problem.
Can't speak for other big name ISPs but you probably have the same problem if you use their routing equipment.

My honest response is "I don't know". I want to say that there's ultimately only going to be one chain that's considered the "most secure" but watching this technology develop over even just the past few months is making me realise it's very difficult to forsee what will happen.
@_date: 2015-11-11 14:08:34


Edit: I think they meant "Bitcoin-style databases". It makes a lot more sense in context IMO.
Yeah this is just about private blockchains but with as many buzzwords as they could possibly jam into the article.

I had some initial impressions and questions about Rootstock after another Redditor showed it to me a few days ago. Considering this article seems to make the same claims as their website, I was hoping someone could answer:




Edit: The article answers this one. ~~Two way peg~~ tbh I can't keep up with the terminology for the sidechains, but the article does answer the question.




















@_date: 2015-11-01 20:49:18




No it actually uses the word key which is the source of almost all of my confusion. I believe the BIP should actually be changed for clarity, copy-pasted from BIP-39:


That's in the section about generating a seed!


I understand all that now from your other answer thanks!




Yeah I find BIP32 a lot easier to read to be honest. I didn't get confused there. It was mostly BIP39's choice of wording which made me question what was happening in BIP32.
Edit: formatting

Yes that's what you linked to. It's hard to know what the issue is without more information though.
Is that the destination?
How much BTC did you try to send to it?

You can still use the old address even if your wallet generates a new address. You should read up on address reuse and educate yourself on the risks of doing so though.

Is there a resource available to read people's horror stories as well as why they happened? Would you mind sharing yours?
I guess it sounds negative for "Bitcoin's image" but I think information like that could help protect new users.

Better than the $0 over 3 days he would have made researching other things.
I find it wild that the Bitcoin sub seems to fail to understand Bitcoin faucets and their use. Literally every single person I've ended up talking into Bitcoin it was after I brought up making up to $1/day on the phones just looking at ads while they do other shit.

Are you sure your nodes are benefitting the network? [These numbers (obtained by googling "Bitcoin node bandwidth usage") are pretty close to others I've seen on Reddit and IRC]( 
Edit: Nodes are

You may not see it now but it's actually more convenient to have larger transactions to keep all the dust low (and therefore TX fees low).
Perhaps if LN ever becomes a reality you could connect to a casino and have them pay immediately.
@_date: 2015-11-16 12:52:04
Thanks for the very detailed response! I guess all that's left now is to wait and see what happens.
Edit: Or, what about Bitcoin gaining these or similar feature on-chain one day in the future? Is that possible / feasible?
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:42:28
That actually sounds a lot more informed than what most "Bitcoin news" sites relay.
Edit: It's not a fantastic article but it really shows that even Fox News is better than NewsBTC at least.

I agree, no need to blow everything up. If we don't apply critical thinking, that'll hurt Bitcoin.

The article mostly discusses a social shift in Sweden. People using cash less, and less banks dealing with physical cash on a regular basis (if I interpreted that correctly). So I don't believe the country minting more money wouldn't really affect that.

I didn't even know the Winklevoss twins were still into technology after the Facebook stuff. Definitely a cool read, I really enjoyed their opinions on why BTC is better than gold.

Either way I don't believe the current (optional) proposed policy is meant to be a long-term solution anyways. I really don't see this policy making an enormous impact to the network in any way. If it did, it's such a minor change to fix.

If a random person on the street tells you the world is going to end tomorrow with nothing to back that up, do you believe them? No, they're not credible.
If the UN declared the world was going to end tomorrow, and had scientific data to back up those claims, do you believe them? Probably, because they're a more credible source.
Credibility has almost everything to do with who says it. That or empirical data.

To me this reads more like "you're an idiot if you gamble with Bitcoins" instead of "be safe while gambling!"
Just follow the usual rules IMO. Don't trust any sites (use some of them, just don't think you can trust them), don't bet more than you're willing to lose. I don't think it's impossible to find gambling sites that are at least legit for a little while.
Personally if I had a successful gambling site, I wouldn't trash my reputation by stealing my customer's money outright. I believe I'd have a lot more to gain running a successful gambling site.

Google doesn't provide definitions as far as I'm aware. Google will take relevant context and place it in a pretty box for definitions though. Saying to "use Google" is vague and confusing.
Edit: I just tried it and Google didn't link me to the dictionary it got the definition from. This means it's possible Google has their own "Google dictionary" and I'm completely wrong.
I can respect you not wanting to give specific examples and definitions for what is or isn't in violation to the rules (as people would stand at the line and say "I'm not breaking any rules lol") but I don't think it's constructive to tell people to use Google.
Also (as you have just witnessed) "stonewalling" is waaaaay too broad and pretty much anyone can be accused of stonewalling. I appreciate where you're coming from but I feel like we'd be alright with just the other new rules.

[This user (from this thread) doesn't seem to have issues.]( This is a frequently discussed topic surrounding JoinMarket. I recommend reading into the market and the subreddit if you have any questions.
From what I've read nobody has had issues trading JoinMarket coins. Almost all fiat is "tainted" in some way anyways. Just because a coin was involved in something shady at some point, doesn't mean it has anything to do with you.
Edit: In all likelihood eventually all coins will be tainted. What then?
