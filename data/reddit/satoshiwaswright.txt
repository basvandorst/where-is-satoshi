Of course the complete genetic code to create a human and build itself from scratch that can fit on the head of a needle and be fully understood by no single human mind - came into existence without a intelligent designer - like saying actually guys there was no satoshi the Bitcoin code evolved from its origin point which was nothing. Let's discus evolution when there's no building blocks to conveniently start with like no planet, no solar system, no universe, no space where the universe exists, no nothing - good luck with that.

Bitcoins blockchain cannot support "mainstream adoption", raising the blocksize would allow more users to use it. If the mainstream are confused by long addresses or decimal points, I'm sure they'll flock to Bitcoin in droves when it has segwit, sidechains, lightening network, rbf, I can just see the impenetrable glaze over someone's eyes as you try to explain all that to them.

Expect a whole basket of blockchains to reach multi-billion dollar levels wiping out bitcoins first mover advantage. Take an honest look at bitcoins dev team, seriously you wouldn't put them in charge of a burger van.
