I have some from 2011, bought at $11. Forgot about them, harddrive died, I've decided I'm going to recover them @ $20,000. 
That's my price. If it crashes...whatever I'm only out a little bit. If I can't recover them, whatever I'm only out a little bit.

Not entirely sure to be honest. Lost the whole workstation due to a powersurge a few years ago and it's been sitting since then. I did swap out the HDD and try it in a different machine a while ago and it didn't work. 
So it's fried I imagine. Honestly not even sure if it had the Electrum wallet/dat file on it because I think I did reformat a couple times prior to the surge.

I'm not overly knowledgeable about hardware and computer science. But I believe you can open the HDD up and either a)swap dead components or b) manually spin the discs and patch together and record the 1s and 0s.
It's over my head, but there are definitely tools capable of doing this in the data recovery/forensics world.

I made the mistake of telling my family that I have/had some that I bought and forgot about in 2011. 
It's literally the only thing half my family wants to talk to me about. It's killing me inside.

Yeah lol. I'll never forget going on 4chan and some guy posted his set up of 4-5 mining rigs that ran 24/7 on Nvidia 780's. Everyone was laughing at him because he spent such a large amount of money on parts, and he was paying so much for hydro for such a little amount of btc. 
It's probably paid 100x his investment now lol.

Yeah for sure. When I think about that though I want to jump off a bridge...
*not actually* but kinda.

Because I used the computer for work. It's got incredibly valuable/sensitive information on it(thankfully that data was backed up).
But I can't risk that information being compromised by someone. If the value of the bitcoin in the wallet ever exceeds the value of my career and livelihood and an early retirement whilst potentially fighting lawsuits....yeah I'll risk it and cash out. But it's not quite there yet.

I run a business and work for a business. I've got client information, work, contracts, contacts, bank details, databases, codebases, licenses, passwords, records/receipts, employee documentation, etc. All on that machine. 
I work for a marketing/advertising consulting company, and run a small creative studio that dabbles in Product design and various multimedia platforms. 
Say what you want, but there's value in what's on that machine. And I'm not going to risk my career for $×××.××× at 25.
