You are intellectually dishonest. You mention QE as if that was the one and only scenario. Quantitative easing is not the only way to bring the market price down. You can flood the market with existing reserves. You can lower taxes on foreign investment. Etc... Let's look at how the latest devaluation was actually organised. Yep, no QE.

Italy is Greece's third largest debt holder. Insolvency can get contagious in today's strongly interconnected banking system.

How is this going to stop the endemic corruption and propensity to fraud and scam? Where do you think the debt comes from? Something like 15% of Greek people receiving disability benefits are actually disabled, most of them just manage to get registered through a friendly doctor.

That seems like an entirely arbitrary if not dogmatic assertion.
Bitcoin has seen stages of explosive growth, and the real stuff is yet to come.
But on the "not much chance" that they will need beyond 1 MB, let's take the safe road and just raise the bloody thing. It's not going to break the network. It will also be a lesson about hard forks.

It's convenient to simply point the finger at the Greek government but that's simply not what the reality is. The Greek government could have simply signed the dotted line and kept getting payments from the ECB. What Tsipras and Varoufakis are doing is trying to stop funnelling money into the debt black hole and make that money actually do work. It's the Eurozone that just won't look at what's actually wrong. I guess that's what you get when you put 20 people around a table and try to make decisions. The inertia is strong in this one.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:45:06
Fearmongering. Italy is fine, as they will sign any piece of paper the ECB will hand over if it means they'll keep getting aid.

I would say 36M is indeed within reach of a resourceful attacker but still really expensive in the medium term.
So possible, but it doesn't seem that the attack would be that successful beyond blocking out zero fee transactions from being included in blocks.
It would merely be the start of a "real" fee market, where transactions with higher attached fees would take precedence.
The attacker would have to raise the fees he is including, making the attack even more expensive. It seems like a fairly blunt and ultimately ineffective strategy.

The difference is that existing reserves are known and so their effect on market price is already factored in. When you take money out of your savings account and use it to buy something, you are not doing quantitative easing.

Sorry to hijack the thread, but I also had a couple of questions on the matter.
Orphans are created by 2 blocks entering a race condition. The outcome is that block number 1 wins as "the" block, and number 2 becomes useless. Race conditions happen when two blocks are found within a given time lapse. How long that time lapse is depends on internet connection speeds and block size.
How long does it take for block of size X to be relayed across all of the network? How long does it take it to reach 51% of the nodes? What difference does that make?
I figure knowing this will help in figuring out your question.

Let me blow your mind a little. The Euro went through a voluntary devaluation a bit earlier this year. This boosted exports and GDP. It's amazing what you can learn with a basic school level understanding of economics. Anyway, if the Euro were to ever "crash", then the low priced goods and services would boost demand from overseas, providing a hard floor to the price and in effect preventing any real crash from happening. In fact a "crash" would be a really good thing, because it would boost internal production and wages.

But no, transactions will validate on both chains, it's just the way they are included in blocks that might change in certain circumstances.

You're being either naive or intellectually dishonest. Obviously as they get 75% of the mining revenues, they are either using some internal mining pool or at least control the chip enough (they are making it) that they could point it to anywhere they like. Tens of millions of hardware devices mining across the planet. I don't know how much of the total hash rate that would be, but it's plausible that it would be enough. Also, Larry Summers was the US Secretary of Treasury, just use your brain instead of your quivering anus and the light might switch on inside your head.

7 transactions per second times 60 equals per minute times 60 equals per hour times 24 equals per day = 604800 satoshis sent in individual transactions. However, nodes filter such so-called "dust" transactions. The minimum output amount for a transaction to be relayed by the network is 546 satoshis. So: 330220800 satoshis = 3.302208 BTC to fill the network for a day.

All the blockchain lets you do is prove a specific piece of data existed at a certain point in time. This can help you demonstrate authorship or authenticity of a document. However, registering a trademark is something different. I believe this is something handled by the specific legal system of a given country.

Your transactions will propagate to both the GavinCoin and PeterCoin blockchains, so you only have 10 coins. This would rely on bilingual nodes that would pick the transaction up in GavinCoin and relay it in PeterCoin terms, but those would without a question pop up if the occasion called for it.

It's great technology and there's a great concept behind it but what is needed to make all of this work is devices actually needing and using satoshis for ID and other purposes, for which there isn't really much of an infrastructure for yet.

This is a problem with culture, not money. In Germany, supermarkets all have bottle recycling machines that spit out a few cents for every empty glass or plastic your bring back. This has created a "market" that gypsies have jumped on, and you can't spend one hour drinking a beer in a park trying to relax without getting constantly harassed and leered at. In Japan, there are no such recycling "incentives", yet everything is spotless. In southern Italy, trash is everywhere. Spitting cents at people for doing monkey tasks is not effective social change.

Andreas is looking more and more like a fanatic sycophant well versed in the art of feverish political fiction rather than a serious commentator. The endless dogmatic blanket statements he dispenses in his pontifical and authoritative tone get more and more ridiculous by the day. On the of the most intellectually offensive ones was that governments are there to steal money. You couldn't find a more idiotic, reductive, ignorant political stance if you tried. Most people evolve from that phase after their teenage skate park anarchist days, but somehow Andreas has managed to carry his stupid torch for a lot longer, and the moths are drawn to the flame like flies to shit. I would hope for him to stick to talking about the purely technological aspects of Bitcoin, which he is admittedly good at.

This stress test/attack is great. Anti-fragility is meant to be tested and poked like that. This is how you face the reality of the problems and take steps to fix them.

I am really sorry you live in a shithole. I suppose my answer would be that if that's what your experience of government is, then you should change your government if you can or go somewhere else. Another way would be to take a second look and try to separate the positive from the negative, even though those are somewhat inextricable. I mean, surely it can't be all that bad. However, you will never be able to live somewhere without a government, because where there are humans, there are political structures.

Quick question, say your key and hash gets compromised or you just don't want to share the file anymore, can you expire the access for unauthorised people or will it stay shared forever? Would it be possible to do something like generate keys for a file that you can share to other people and expire those keys when you feel like it?
