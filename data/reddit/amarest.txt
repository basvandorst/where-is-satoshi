An eBay style crypto market is HUGE. This should be posted in LTC and PPC subreddits  as well

PeerToPeer coin brings a lot to the table as an alternative to bitcoin. Think dividends when it comes to the Proof-of-Stake protocol.

Don't wait, BUY BUY BUY. It'll be @ $149.99 by tonight and you'll be mad you didn't. I've been in skeptically since 44, mark my words this baby is poised to really take off. Mt.Gox crash is directly affecting the price. MT.Gox crashed because of too much DEMAND. If you don't understand the basic economic significance of this you do not need to be even trading bitcoins.
Even with assuming bitcoin is a bubble this dip is good for bitcoin's overall short term growth. Buy low while you have the chance, grab on to your nutsack and wait for the real fun to begin. The crash is also good for the future stability. Continuation of these issues will only result in a mass exodus out of MtGox into other exchanges. Personally I moved all my coins off MtGox to bitfloor this morning. I'm sure many other people have as well, not only to bitfloor but to the others. This will result in an overall decrease in volatility in the markets. 
Short Answer: It is the perfect storm

Same problem. iPhone got stolen and now I am having a lot of trouble recovering the token on my replacement iPhone. Any luck with support?
