Australia has a R&amp;D tax credit program.. If you spend $100 on R&amp;D, you can apply with the ATO and receive $45 from the Australian government as a prepayment against future tax obligations (e.g. you lose the right to offset your future revenue with NOLs). It's only for small startup companies who haven't earned more than $20M in aggregate.


Maybe, maybe not.. but they understand taxation in Australia just fine.

If the ATO's allegations are true, Wright filed for tax credits based on fraudulent expenses -- aka, he was stealing money from other tax payers.

This means nothing really..
The worry from a crypto standpoint is that someone will develop a quantum computer that can break standard encryption much faster than classical computers. Much of [crypto relies]( on the prime factorization of huge numbers, which is very computational difficult. 
A quantum computer running something called '[Shor's Algorithm]( could factor very large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers can, putting everything secure at risk (including the bitcoin public / private key system).
Fortunately for bitcoin (and crypto) what D-Wave has developed is a [quantum annealer]( *not* a general quantum computer. Google has shown that D-Wave's machine can solve different types of problems much faster than classical computers can, but this has no impact on prime factorization. The applied results from these quantum improvements in optimization problems are more likely to be faster shipping and other varieties of [combinatorial optimization]( problems.

I'll describe how it works with round numbers since his company failed and let you decide; 
1. Spend $10M on qustionable R&amp;D activity in Australia, company doesn't make profit yet (hence doesn't pay taxes).
2. File for R&amp;D tax credit - Government gives you $4.5M.
3. Pay yourself extremely high salary, buy equipment from other companies you own then claim bankruptcy.
4. Company shuts down without ever making profits, R&amp;D work looks suspicious. 
5. Government is out $4.5M, no taxes were ever paid since no profits were ever claimed. 
It's designed for honest companies to get the benefit of their net operating losses ahead of time instead of waiting until they're cash flow positive but there's a risk they never achieve profitability and there's a risk with shady actors that they lie about their R&amp;D activities with the intention of getting free money from the government, which they then pay themselves and then claim bankruptcy.

Ah, Zerohedge, your intransigence is making much more sense. This will be my last response since it's getting a bit tired chasing your ever-changing rationale. 
Again -- The conspiracy you (and the morons at Zerohedge) claim is afoot is one that is *reported in the same publication that publishes the 'official numbers'.* They're relying on BLS figures to claim the BLS is hiding figures. Does this not belie the entire argument? 
Anyway, why stop at 2007?  The BLS shows figures since 2000. Add them all up you get 17.5M jobs which is ~15% of our labor force. So you're telling me the unemployment rate is wrong by 250%-300%?  Come on.

That's true as well, but you have to remember that most derivatives are hedges against something that a bank is already carrying on the balance sheet, so the real exposure is much smaller. There is always counterparty risk and AIG showed us how precarious that can be, but during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the total cost of the bailout to the government was only $612B -- which was matched by $660B in inflows -- [netting a profit]( in the long run.
Obviously there were better ways of handling the banks and insurers that blew everything up (I fully supported full nationalization of them and claiming they 'netted a profit' just reinforces their moral hazard) but nobody can honestly claim that the real exposure was 600x what was seen.

[Bootstrap]( is a 'Framework' to make web sites.  If you've noticed lately, most startups have sites that *feel* very similar -- similar buttons, lists, splash pages, etc. -- this is due to Bootstrap.  It's similar to Wordpress, except it only handles the 'Front End', where with Wordpress you can use it as a Content Management System. 
It basically lets companies worry about their own products and provides them with a very tidy, quick-to-configure visual look and feel. Formerly, companies would have to worry about cross-browser compatibility, mobile compatibility, screen-size scaling, accessibility, etc.. With Bootstrap, you add your own content, add a few lines of CSS and Javascript, and then your website will look polished on every device, across every platform. 
It's pretty neat from a technical standpoint but it does produce very generic looking results. In my opinion, 'Bootstrap Generic' is far better than the catastrophe of home-brewed websites though, so I'm on board.

Person B sends Person A bitcoin and then receives Kindle. 
Person A now has Bitcoin which is changed for cash. 
Person B has a Kindle and likely a visit from the police since the Kindle was purchased with a stolen card and they're the only person tied to the transaction.

I posted below, but it's not that simple, again, relying on that leaked document.. 
Assets: 
* 2,000 BTC
* $22,430,000 USD in corporate accounts
* $5,000,000 USD in CoinLab
* $5,500,000 USD held by DHS
* 624,408 BTC (Customers)
* 120,000 BTC (MtGox)    -80,208 BTC from suspicious accounts (!! Confiscating funds !!)
* $55,000,000 USD
So if you net out the BTC:
* 744,408BTC - 2,000BTC = **742,408BTC owed**
And the cash (I'm assuming the $5.5M to DHS is gone forever):
* $55,000,000 - $22,430,000 - $5,000,000 = **$27,570,000 owed**
So to recapitalize this company, back to square one, you'd have to spend $27.6M, plus an amount that would buy 742,408 BTC *at today's prices*.  Not to mention how much purchases of that size would move the market. Say it didn't impact the market at all, 742,408 BTC at $500 = $370M. Add in a 10% for working cap, and you'd be looking at about $450M needed to recapitalize the company. 
$450M for a insanely risky stream of $10M/year.  Good god is that a horrible deal. On no timeline, at no discount rate is that a positive NPV or IRR. 
Mt. Gox is forever insolvent. The money is gone.

There are plenty of people who complain about regulations and taxes in the U.S. and in California -- my big brash Texan boss was one.

There is literally nowhere on earth outside of the U.S. with the capital and workforce to make many of these businesses happen.

If the bulb cost $40 (miner + LED + wifi) -- Your NPV at a 15% discount rate would be something like negative $14 over the life of the bulb. 
This is with extremely generous assumptions; 
1. The mining chip stays on at all times
2. The electricity would be consumed by the light anyway, so no 'cost' there
3. The difficulty doesn't increase
4. The halvening doesn't happen
In reality, it would be a power sink, it'd probably only work when your light was turned on, the difficulty increases every two weeks, and the reward in 2017 will be half of what it is now, followed by additional halvenings in subsequent years. 
Buying one of these stupid light bulbs would cost you a significant amount of money over the long run.

If it uses a single [mining chip]( at 3.8 GH/s, and we assume that difficulty doesn't increase over time -- it would take 25,542 days to mine a single bitcoin (Just about 70 years).  Of course, difficulty does increase over time, so it's safe to say it would never, ever mine a single coin.

[Go here]( and lookup your graphics card. I think the closest one on the list is a GTX680, but close enough for our purposes. It gets about 120 MH/s at 100W.. 
Let's be super generous and say your later card gets 200MH/s at 100W. 
Plug that hash rate into [this calculator](
1. 100W running 24/7 would cost you about $7/month. 
2. 200MH/s mining 24/7 would yield you about 0.00006 BTC/month ($0.01/month)
At current difficulty, it would take you about 485,000 days to earn a single bitcoin. Over that time period, you would have spent ~$131,000 on electricity. Unless of course your pocket fusion reactor cuts down on power costs before then.

The murder for hire was part of the sentencing, not really part of the trial. Criminal conspiracy law has its origins in mob sentencing, consider two different mob organizations;

Bitcoin companies aren't charities, they've raised hundreds of millions in VC because their investors expect them to return 100x as much as has been invested. Where are these multi-billion dollar returns going to come from if not spread / fees?  Wealthy consumers who perform most of the retail transactions by dollar amount get 2%+ back from credit cards and have consumer protections - what is their incentive to switch to Bitcoin?  All companies have significant amounts of money tied up in working capital so instant settlement isn't important since they often owe as much as they are due.

is right, you get dividends when investing in the S&amp;P so you can't just take the end price and the beginning price to calculate your return. 
Here's [a total return calculator that even adjusts for CPI]( 
Recalculating your figures with your cherry picked dates (S&amp;P reached 1,552 in late March, 2000 so I'll start at Apr, 2000): 
Apr 2000 - Dec 2014 - Total Return:  **84.7%**
If you had invested 1,000 at the dot-com peak in 2000, you'd have $1,847 today. Even if you pay fees of 1% annually (literally 10x what most brokerages charge), you'd have $1,569 today. 
* Five Year Return - Jan 2010 - Dec 2014   Annual Return:  15.3%
* Five Year Return - Jan 2010 - Dec 2014   Annual Return (net inflation):  13.2%
* If you invested $1,000 at start, you'd have $2,012 today. 
* Ten Year Return - Jan 2005 - Dec 2014   Annual Return:  7.9%
* Ten Year Return - Jan 2005 - Dec 2014   Annual Return (net inflation):  5.6%
* If you invested $1,000 at start, you'd have $2,125 today. 
* Fifteen Year Return - Jan 2000 - Dec 2014   Annual Return:  4.4%
* Fifteen Year Return - Jan 2000 - Dec 2014   Annual Return (net inflation):  2.0%
* If you invested $1,000 at start, you'd have $1,899 today. 
* Twenty Year Return - Jan 1995 - Dec 2014   Annual Return:  9.7%
* Twenty Year Return - Jan 1995 - Dec 2014   Annual Return (net inflation):  7.3%
* If you invested $1,000 at start, you'd have $6,363 today. 
* Twenty-Five Year Return - Jan 1990 - Dec 2014   Annual Return:  9.7%
* Twenty-Five Year Return - Jan 1990 - Dec 2014   Annual Return (net inflation):  7.0%
* If you invested $1,000 at start, you'd have $10,139 today. 
The S&amp;P is an exceedingly reliable investment.

Yeah they did their math backwards.. The price 2 years ago is 95% lower than it is today, but that definitely doesn't mean it's only up 95%. Easy correction for them though, just take the inverse of 1-.95, lo-and-behold .05/1 ~= 2,000%

Currencies all trade at parity based on their respective inflation rates -- this is called [Purchasing Power Parity](  If Bitcoin were merely falling in relationship to the dollar, an arbitrage opportunity would exist with a 3-way trade into a third currency. 
Look at the chart of BTC:CNY;
Notice how it's following the exact same trend? Bitcoin is having a secular fall in value, it could be assisted by the strengthening dollar but that's definitely not the proximate cause.

Yep. And mining difficulty represents the 'drag' as well since miners need to cover their costs (power, rent, payroll) in local currency. Miners need more dollars (or Yen or RMB) to support the much larger mining operations that are required to find coins today, which necessitates the selling off of many of their mined coins.

It is correct, these are textbook definitions, not theories. 


This is exceptionally rare, especially for companies that have hard assets and any depth in the order book.  Most of the time when companies trade below book, it's because they have dubious assets that smart investors are wary of. These companies (usually mining and insurance companies) claim a high value for intangible assets or they undervalue their liabilities which can sometimes push their share price below their book value, but this only works for small companies or big ones with massive liability potential.

My math to calculate the fee: 
Current rate on the BPI: $273 US (£179.9)
So 0.7BTC should cost 0.7 x £179.9 = £125.9
You paid £135 which would mean your fee to access BTC was [£135 - £125.9] / £125.9 = 0.0727, or almost 7.3%
Doesn't seem like a very good deal...

Just to add on to this since people apparently have never built anything.. 
Many of the enconomies of scale show up in indirect costs and supporting infrastructure rather than direct costs like the physical miners (although those will see economies too in the form of bulk discounts).
Just off the top of my head, the following would be cheaper (per hash) in a data center as compared to a one-off installation:
* Power connections to the building
* Power rates - Large consumers negotiate favorable rates, usually 1/2 - 1/3 of the listed rate. 
* Internal power supplies / connections / server racks
* Shipping / Receiving / Installation of new miners
* Engineering &amp; Design costs
* HVAC &amp; Rack cooling costs
* Maintenance Labor / Management costs
* Property / Rent costs

If you own 1 share of Microsoft and they closed the doors tomorrow, sold off all of their equipment and IP, then returned this money to shareholders (We'll call this Total Value), your share would be worth:
[Total Value - Outstanding Debt] x [1 Share / Total Outstanding Shares]
The stock price will never fall below that figure, which is what people  mean when they say 'intrinsic value'.
The current stock price represents the cumulative market assumption of the total value of future cash flows divided by the number of outstanding shares. These cash flows are much more unpredictable and less certain (which is why good stock analysts are paid so highly -- to divine what future cash flows will look like) but the stock price will only very rarely trade below the book value of the current company.

A high end laptop GPU can run at ~100MH/s (most are a fraction of this number). If the price was $200/btc, the difficulty was 1/10th of what it is currently, your daily mining revenue at 100MH/s [would be $.0002]( -- two one-hundredths of a penny. When you add in power costs at $0.10/kWh, your 250W laptop miner would cost you $0.60 - $0.0002 = $0.5998/day.  You'd lose over $200/year trying to mine.

Ethically / morally?   Depends on your political point of view.
Legally? Completely and utterly guilty..
Shrem was knowingly laundering the proceeds from a very large vendor on Silk Road, to the tunes of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. (A few of the exhibits showed weekly amounts of near $40k - $50k) Shrem was in charge of compliance for BitInstant, and he was personally approving all of the questionable transactions. When Shrem's cofounder and CEO tried to ban the guy for all of his suspicious activity, Shrem personally emailed him and told him how to evade their AMC / KYC protocols.. He then gave him volume discounts since he was bringing in so much business. 
The indictment is damning from a legal perspective: 
Shrem got two years, BTCKing - who was laundering all of the money - got 4 years.. Which seems pretty reasonable given how extreme drug sentencing can be.

Shareholders usually need to approve any 'material' sale of assets (materiality can vary by company or project but all assets would surely be material), but if you sold 100% of the assets as a way to wind down operations, then the shareholders are the ones who would benefit from their sale -- of course they'd still be responsible for any outstanding debts as well.

Just a clarification but Coinbase is *not* FDIC-insured in the sense most people think. If you have your money in a Coinbase wallet and they go bankrupt, the FDIC will not be reimbursing you. Coinbase aggregates customer funds and keeps that money in FDIC-insured accounts, so if the bank Coinbase uses goes under, the money will be protected.
Basically, the FDIC protects you against the risk of the bank that Coinbase uses going bankrupt, not the risk of Coinbase going bankrupt. It's a subtle but important distinction.

Zimbabwe couldn't print the bills that their debt was owed in.. that's the key difference. 
Taking debt is agreeing to a legal obligation to repay that loan under very specific terms. Zimbabwe's debt was all foreign-owned and the terms of their loan dictated that they had to pay in primarily US Dollars and Euros (to the IMF, World Bank, and EIB).  Since their economy was destroyed they couldn't raise money via taxes to pay off the loans so the government in Zimbabwe needed to exchange their currency for USD or Euros on the open market -- They can print as many Zimbabwean Dollars as they want, but the foreign exchange mechanism ensures it will only serve to drive the hyperinflation that you saw over the past decade.
All of the US's debt is denominated in USD -- to meet the terms of our loans, the government could just print the $17T owed and we'd be debt free. This is very different to Zimbabwe since we don't have to exchange USD for anything to pay our loans.
There are obvious issues with just printing money to pay the bills, but it's a very different mechanism than what Zimbabwe had to deal with.

The future value of cash flows has to be estimated since we don't know what future discount rates are going to look like (time value of money and all) and we don't know exactly where a company is going to end up. That's why people suggest investing in index funds, since you'll get the average return of all of the companies in the index, which removes some of the volatility of a single equity. 
If Twitter shut down today, they would pay off all of their debt ($1.956B) and then disperse the rest of their cash and assets to their shareholders -- a balance of about $3 billion ([Google Finance](  This is the *minimum* value for the market cap since that money is real cash that could be distributed today.
Twitter is going to make money for years though, likely for decades, so on top of $3B book value, you have to estimate how much money you expect them to make, and on what time frame. This is where the uncertainty with share prices comes from.


Intrinsic value is a *qualitative* measurement, not a *quantitative* one.  A share of Twitter stock grants you rights to a proportion of current liquidation rights and future cash flows -- a number that is larger than $0 -- thus it has intrinsic value. The estimates of future value look smaller today than they did yesterday, so the share price decreased. This doesn't affect whether Twitter's stock has intrinsic value or not.

Square, Venmo, Paypal, etc. etc. all offer this functionality.  Bitcoin likely has a chance here since the irreversible transfers would eliminate what is a pretty small risk. I'm not sure why the unbanked would be sending you money, but in any case, they'll need to be 'banked' first in order to buy bitcoin, this is the crux of the major problem with many of these theories.

I can do it for you.. 
1. $50K USD into Coinbase (less 1% fee, or $500) at $248.12 = 199.50024BTC
2. Transfer to Rebit.ph with a .0001 bitcoin fee = 199.50014BTC
3. Rebit.ph's current rate is 10,857PHP/BTC, so you end up with 2,165,974.13 PHP
4. Rebit also notes that large balances will see a separate fee, email them to find out. 
5. The current spot price is 44.49PHP/USD, so the value transferred to the Phillipines, even ignoring the unlisted fee from Rebit, would only be $48,671.32
At minimum, this little journey has cost our prospective client $1,328.  Foreign exchange markets are ruthlessly efficient.

This discussion was about the total costs of bitcoin transactions, it doesn't matter which side it comes from -- in either case the customer will end up paying for it. Unless of course you don't think things like credit card transaction fees are passed onto the customer..


If you'd ever bought a SAAS service, you'd know that with accounting integration and tech support, at a certain size, you *always* need the enterprise plan. Newegg is the type of customer that Bitpay's enterprise plan was designed for. Obviously I have no idea what plan they're actually on, but I'd bet 90:10 that they're on the enterprise level.

They started with $50k USD and ended up with €47,313 at a conversion rate of €0.95/$. 
If you wanted to do the same on Coinbase at today's [bid/ask]( 
1. $50K USD into Coinbase (less 1% fee, or $500) at $248.97 = 198.81913 BTC
2. 198.81913 BTC to Euro^* at $248.67 = $49,440.35  (^* I can't find their Euro rate, so I'm assuming it mirrors their USD one) 
3. $49,440.35 x €0.95/$ = €46,968.34
4. Coinbase takes a 1% fee on the way out too, so you'd end up with €46,498.65
So to reiterate, if you had $50k cash in New York and wanted Euros in Frankfurt; 
1. This 'inefficient' Goldman exec's system would yield €47,313
2. Bitcoin, using Coinbase which is probably the most established company, would yield €46,499
Bitcoin would cost you over €814 *more* than this new system.. Total lost to fees and bid/ask with bitcoin would be over $1,050 USD.

Newegg pays Bitpay something on the order of $3000/month to process payments and Bitpay has a ~1% spread.  Whether NewEgg decides to write-off those costs as a marketing decision or not doesn't make them costless. More importantly, what you're describing barely qualifies as a currency, more of a barter system, and could have easily been accomplished if you just bought your brother the hard drive with your BTC and had it shipped to his house. This also ignores whatever cost you incurred to buy them with in the first place.


Because there still exist miner fees, Bitpay fees, losses on spread, etc. Most people will gladly trade privacy for the 2% cash back afforded by credit cards that are universally accepted.

If you put $100 in Twitter on Jan 1st, you'd have $117.84 today (vs. $72 for bitcoin). If you put $100 in Twitter exactly 1 year ago, you'd have $101.54 today (vs. $53 for bitcoin).  More importantly, Twitter was founded just over 9 years ago and is worth ~$33 billion today. 
Yes, yes.. "Arbitrary dates! Bitcoin is up infinity percent over 6 years!" 
The point that you're not comprehending and are somehow making fun of, is that Twitter stock *actually has intrinsic value.*  The market cap of a company is the present value of all future cash flows to shareholders. This is a real, quantifiable figure that is easily estimated from about 10 minutes in a DCF model. 
Today there was a leak that Twitter's growth was slower than expected, so the market lopped off 18% of the stock's value. This is because growth compounds, so all future cash flows are likely to be a bit smaller. Importantly though, *shareholders are still going to receive future cash flows.* This explains why that even with slower growth, Twitter's equity is still worth 10x the entire bitcoin ecosystem.

There are different types of deflation -- the type you're describing is generally referred to as benign deflation, which typically results in falling prices due to increased productivity. 
The other variety (the concerning one) which doge is talking about, is typically referred to as malign deflation. In this version, falling prices are caused by a drop in Aggregate Demand which leads to excess capacity. Falling demand leads to less spending, which leads to further falling demand, which leads to less spending...  Prices do fall, which is good for those who are still employed and spending, but wages are sticky (it's not easy to give people a pay cut) so the more typical way to cut costs is to have layoffs. 
Here's a good chart:  - Benign deflation on the right and malign deflation on the left.
In the version on the right, which doge referred to as a 'rightward supply shift', you can see that lower prices come about through more productive supply. 
In the version on the left, which is the concerning version, total price levels are falling down the existing supply curve. This can lead to a vicious cycle (as opposed to a virtuous cycle) as spending falls across the economy.

7tps is the ideal maximum given the most simple inputs and outputs. Adding in multisig or additional receive addresses increases the transaction size. The current average transaction would correspond to roughly 2.9tps. (The average block is ~0.4mb in size and contains ~700 transactions. Full blocks could only hold 1/0.4 x 700 = 1,750 transactions, so for 10-minute blocks, this would result in 1,750 / 10 / 60 = 2.91tps)

It's an asset swap. The Central Bank will buy assets (usually packages of loans) from commercial banks with newly printed money.
Before QE, a bank could have total assets of $2M ($1M in cash, $1M in Mortgage Backed Securitites).  After QE, the bank still has $2M in assets, but the Central Bank would have given them $1M for their MBS, so now the bank just has $2M in cash. 
The Central Bank doesn't just hand out money, they swap less liquid, riskier assets (like debt instruments) for more liquid, safer assets (namely cash). In doing so, they lower the banks risk profile, increase their Tier-1 capital, decrease yields on other debt instruments, and they hope it's enough to encourage more lending and investment by the banks.

This is an extremely misleading statement. 
Amazon's *net income* might be 1% but that figure is completely divorced from the cost of doing business. Net income is the figure that Amazon uses to calculate their tax burden, so they go out of their way to minimize that figure.  The relevant number is their *gross margin* which takes into account transaction processing costs as well as all of the other inputs for the cost of goods sold. Amazon's *Gross Margin* is right around 30%. So they could go from 30% to 30.5% gross margin assuming that they are paying 1% transaction fees on credit card sales right now. 
Amazon is notorious for delaying expenses and then pulling them forward so they always have ~0 net income -- which they would have to pay taxes on. This is a pretty clear article about Bezos' aversion to tax and Amazon's history in minimizing it: 
This isn't a value judgement about paying taxes but just a warning that claiming 'Amazon only makes 0.7% profit and that switching to bitcoin would double it', is an extremely misleading statement.

You're misunderstanding QE and banking.. 
Here's a good graphic, but the important thing to keep in mind is that during QE the Central Bank buys assets from non-bank financial companies (pensions, insurance companies, etc.): 
While banks do earn interest on the newly created reserves, QE also creates an accompanying liability for the bank in the form of the deposit from the non-bank financial company, which the bank will itself typically have to pay interest on. In other words, QE leaves banks with both a new IOU from the central bank but also a new, equally sized IOU to consumers. 
Banks cannot directly lend out reserves. Reserves are an IOU from the central bank to commercial banks. Those banks can use them to make payments to each other, but they cannot ‘lend’ them on to consumers in the economy, who do not hold reserves accounts. When banks make additional loans they are matched by extra deposits — the amount of reserves does not change.

Even if that were correct, that's only EBITDA you still need to depreciate the equipment to get to a net income line.. 
Random speculation; 
1. Mining hardware looks to cost ~$5,000 per 1,000GH, add in 30% additional costs for power supplies, racks, etc. = $6,500/TH
2. They have ~8PH/s capacity which is equivalent to 8,000TH/s
3. $6,500 * 8,000 = $52M in capital expense.. 
4. Figure out the depreciation period.. Mining equipment burns out fast and becomes obsolete as difficulty increases and prices drop. I'll be charitable and call it 12 months?
5. $52M/12 = $4.3M/month in depreciation expense... 
Yikes. Let's assume they can get a bulk discount on everything and chop 20% off the price, that would get you to $3.5M/month in depreciation expense. Figure out the IRR on $700k/month based on a $35M investment and you're going to be pretty disappointed...

The attempted murder charges were brought up solely due to Federal sentencing guidelines. When you're convicted of a crime, there are sentencing guidelines that inform the court of how long your imprisonment should be. Some crimes have mandatory minimums, but most are on a sliding scale. Once you understand this, the entire trial makes perfect sense from the prosecution's perspective. The most serious charges are probably the 'Continuing Criminal Enterprise' ones, but they could be surpassed by the narcotics trafficking with the right conditions. So the flow goes like: 
1. Continuing Criminal Enterprise - Min. Sentence: 20yrs
2. Narcotics trafficking (NT) - Sentence depends on quantity of drugs &amp; 'special circumstances'
3. NT base sentence - 1kg of Heroin, 5kg of Cocaine, 10mg of LSD (what DA charged him with) - Level 30
4. NT - Using web to mass market drugs: +2 levels (hello testimony about forum posts and dealer 'hearing about SR')
5. NT - Committing or directing violence: +2 levels (hello attempted murder)
6. NT - Keeping drug production facility: +2 levels (hello shroom house)
7. NT - Maintaining pattern of criminal behavior: +2 levels
So if convicted of all charges, the minimum sentence would start at a 20-year mandatory minimum from the criminal enterprise but he could easily see more from the Narcotics charge. Level 30 recommendations for first offenders are for 97 - 121 months, but for Level 38 it's 253 - 293 months. If they get another special consideration on there, the Level 40 sentence is 292 - 365 months. So instead of 20 years minimum, he's facing 24 years minimum. 
Also if he somehow escaped one charge of the indictment, the DA have provided additional means to get him the sentence they think best fits his crimes. 
Long story, Ross is facing a *very* long prison sentence and all of the weird court quirks about hacking, growing shrooms, attempting to inflict violence, etc are specifically to 'check the boxes' of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. 
Here's the table with the different levels:

The Wiki has a pretty good answer: 
But basically the difficulty is set so that on average, all of the blocks take 10 minutes to mine. The 10 minute figure is a probability (some will take longer, some shorter) but within a certain confidence interval, they should take 10 minutes each. 
So say we're mining at difficulty *D0* today and a difficulty adjustment is coming tomorrow to reset the difficulty to *D1*. If the average time to mine a block during the *D0* difficulty is  less than 10 minutes, then *D1* will adjust upwards (that is, it will be more difficult to mine) so that the average mining time during the *D1* period will be 10 minutes.  If the average block took longer than 10 minutes during *D0*, the next adjustment will make mining easier so that the blocks mined during *D1* will be easier to find. 
The 44 billion is just an arbitrary number that matches the calculated networking hashrate to solving a block every 600 seconds.  As you can see, the network difficulty is [~320M GH/s](  You can do a shortcut for the math in the form of D x 2^32 / 600 = Network Hashrate, which we can then solve to determine the ideal difficulty:  
    D x 2^32 / 600 / 1000 / 1000 = 320M GH/s.
[D = 4.47 * 10^10 ]( Which gets us to within 0.5% of the actual difficulty!
When you mine, you're trying to find the nonce that generates a hash that is below the target (which is set with a simple function that varies inversely with the difficulty). The range for the hash is from zero to a giant 256 bit number.  As the difficulty figure gets higher, the difficulty formula ensures that you need to come below a smaller number, creating a sure-proof way to verify that people are expending more computing power to 'win' the block.

No, that's not it.  He needn't even be charged with the attempted murder for them to be brought up in this case. 
Let's just look at one charge with one special circumstance: 
1. Narcotics Trafficking Conspiracy -- When you look at the sentencing guidelines for someone convicted of violating [Title 21 U.S. Code § 841 (a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)]( The minimum sentencing level depends on the quantity of drugs being sold, in Ross's case, it's [Level 30.]( 
2. The rest of the sentencing guidelines for that criminal code violation rely on "Special Offense Characteristics" (ie did he use a firearm, did he murder anyone, did anyone OD from his product, etc.). One of the characteristics involves the use of violence while committing his crimes.  Or [verbatim]( 


So the prosecution included the testimony about Ross's attempts to have his blackmailer killed because in the event that Ross was convicted of the main charge, they also wanted to demonstrate that he "made a credible threat to direct the use of violence" which would increase his sentencing Level from 30 to 32.  
He's not being convicted of threatening to direct violence, he's being convicted of narcotics trafficking but the evidentiary standards are different for the Special Circumstances as compared to actual charges. After convicting Ross of the Trafficking charges the Jury / Judge (I forget which, though I think the Jury) will decide whether or not they feel that he "Made a credible threat to direct the use of violence" as well, which the judge will take into account during sentencing.

Yep, I just googled a random mining website for my price, it could've been outdated.. Point is, depending on initial cost and depreciation schedule, their profitability can be dramatically different.

Meh.. mixed results I would guess.. The US is getting ~$100 billion / year in payments from the Fed from our adventures in QE, we have extremely low inflation, much improved unemployment, consumer lending has picked up dramatically, and GDP has been pretty strong.  There's no "control" in which we didn't undertake QE but seems thing to be going okay.

Just make sure you have a plan to get to another non-extradition country after sea level rise wipes out the Marshall Islands.

This is absurd. All of the unemployment measures are printed in the exact same report. We refer to U3 for historical reasons, but the U6 numbers are literally [printed on the same page]( as the U3 -- This would be the worst conspiracy ever. 
Since the bottom of the recession, 10M more people have jobs, wages are up an average of $3.50/hr, U6 decreased from 17.5% to 11%, U3 decreased from 10% to 5.5%..

Link to new research which describes a method to compromise the network with far less than 51% of the mining power:
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:05:36
For people disputing this; 
* Average Block Size: [0.35MB](
* Average Number of Tx/Block: [600](
1MB / 0.35MB * 600TX = 1,715TX/Block Max
1,715TX / 10 mins / 60S/Min = 2.85TX/S
If the current transaction size represents the average (which it must come close to), then the current implementation would peak at **2.85 tps.**  The 7 tps figure is the ideal assuming that each transaction is as small as possible (no multisig, etc.).

Bitcoins don't make any sense at all in Turkey.
There is a real risk that if the protests continue, there will be a clampdown on internet and phones. One can safely assume the street vendors and grocers aren't going to trust that you'll pay them in the future with this virtual currency.  How much is a Bitcoin worth in Syria when you can't connect to the internet to trade it? 
Cash or other physical goods are the only currencies of use to the Turks.

Yes, I know how encryption works. 
Ross was at a public library, he was distracted by two agents staging a fake fight behind him, when he turned to look what was going on, a third grabbed his laptop and the 'fighting' agents arrested him. 
From that point, they had all of the time in the world to examine his laptop and do what they wanted -- A/C or no A/C, battery or no battery, it wouldn't have made any difference. Aside from some of the more loony suggestions about tethers and facial recognition (which would easily be defeated by watching Ross for ~1 hr), there was nothing he could do.

IANAL, only closely affiliated with a few, but it's my understanding that it doesn't make much of a difference.
Most of these corporate-speak agreements are unenforceable and not binding, as [Zappos found out]( They will discourage some people, but a motivated lawyer could likely still bring suit.

You're confusing a number of concepts there.. The nominal value of the debt doesn't change (it's always $2,000) but what does change is the *real* value of that debt. If inflation increases, the *real* value of the debt decreases which makes servicing it in *nominal* dollars easier.

Just copying for posterity (from RMessmann @ 6pm Pacific on Apr 11):










Anyway the way I see it, the current price is as low as BTC has been in weeks - and could potentially be the lowest it will ever be again. When I see ~$120 BTC, I'm thinking buy buy buy. I'm also thinking there are a ton of people out there looking to buy at this price as well.


I'll update with Mt. Gox's price in 14hrs. 
14 hours later Gox has settled around $73/btc.. A loss of 50% in the last day, 75% in the last 2... be careful out there people..

TOS are not legally binding, you can 'agree' to all sorts of things in a TOS that would never hold up in court. 
I would think there's a huge liability to Kickstarter by allowing "repeat" offenders without any warning of such.

The poor have *debt* not savings. Inflation helps them... 
To expand: 
The bottom 20% of households have negative net worths, the bottom 40% of households have less than $20k in net worth... Inflation isn't causing them harm.
