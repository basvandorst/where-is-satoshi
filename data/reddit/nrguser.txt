Wasn't sure how the fork was gonna go, sold at $2800, feels bad man. But only sold .012, so don't feel so bad =D

Currently using the Android wallet for small amounts but looking into getting a "cold storage" wallet this weekend since I purchased some bitcoins on coinbase and going to rid the roller coaster out. I don't have many posts on here yet because I just joined this sub a few days ago. Friend of mine quit mining and gave me his 5 ASIC miners, since I have access to free electricity I have been messing around with them. I don't care much in mining for money but regardless as long as the USB ASIC miners are functional they'll be on the network. (I'm a big fan of using electronics until they are dead and beyond repair, e-waste is stupid)

That's what I was going to research more this weekend. I had seen someone talking about using Ubuntu on a USB stick and booting from it, and then creating the wallet my wifi turned off (laptop switch ftw). But I'll add armory to my notes and look at it since I've seen a few people talk about it on and off while lurking the past few days. 
Thanks for the tip too =D

I am on try  and keep getting denied, I understand they need to verify people's information but this is stupid and one more try and I'm going to just abandon coinbase.

I still don't understand the problem with all of this. If larger retailers are not willing to accept bitcoins I will gladly go to a mom and pop shop that will accept it without validation. Regardless of white lists or black lists mom and pop shops are not going to care, as long as they get their money. Because of the nature of bitcoins if no US companies are willing to be the middle man than they can go to an international company and they will gladly take their business. Bitcoin is not associated with any one country, even if the US didn't allow it we could still sell them to countries that do, that's the point of being decentralized.
