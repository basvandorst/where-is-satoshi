Dude, definitely snapcard. They seriously have the best purchasing interface and service when it comes to getting you your product. They've been so helpful that when I had a problem with a purchase they actually reimbursed me extra for the trouble I went through. They're an incredible team doing an incredible service and they're one of the bitcoin companies that I think deserve some help branching out. They are so helpful that at times when I have a problem I refer to, an ask for certain people by name. Absolutely incredible service for anyone looking to purchase things with their hard earned coins. If anyone is deserving of 150$ and so much more I think, it would definitely be the snapcard team.

My question is what is a prescription, is it a prescription for happiness or focus, or a prescription for each video?

I think bad customer service is the reason for all the moody people in the world lol.

That's preposterous! Only someone with sense would want to do that!

It's amazing how something so relatively new is already "dated". That's very cool.

Just think, what if we had snapcards customer service in retail stores. Shopping would actually be enjoyable for me.

Also, I think we gave it the reddit hug of death. I haven't gotten to sign up yet, but when I do, my username there will be the same as this one. Zachamiester

Yes it does, there's an FAQ there as well that's worth reading

But first, here's a robot for you to talk to that doesn't understand how you speak, and will make you want to punch everything within 10 feet.

Funny thing happened to me. I had created something that blew up based on a thread that's long gone now, and my bitcoin Qr code was my soundcloud profile picture. Someone figured out what it was and sent me $1.25. It was really a surreal thing, because I'm sure you as an artist can sympathize with the feeling of always fearing that your work isn't good enough.
