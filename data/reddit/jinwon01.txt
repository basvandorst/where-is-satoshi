If everyone invested into bitcoin for it's long term potential instead of pump-and-dumping it all the time for a quick buck it can be stable. I say give it some time, bitcoin is still in it's infancy. Once more people are educated it should be a stable.

Agreed. Best of luck you OP.

Same here. 2015 could be a big year for bitcoin with new innovations and applications on the rise. I could see it go into double digits and accumulation will begin again pushing the BTC price up.
