Want to provide some insight into the hack?  It would be good information for website owners...

Please don't spread wrong information, the client fully validates the blockchain from bootstrap.dat.  I've installed Bitcoin with this and it's definitely faster than using the existing protocol to sync.

Probably a bit late to the party, but I just realised if you reverse his initials...

I was trying to do this with vuze but couldn't get it to work :(

You're not thinking fourth-dimensionally!
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:10:57
lol you can hardly call that arbitrary.  I'd much rather calculate my age in the amount of times I have been around the sun.  Saying how many times the Earth has spun on its axis makes me too dizzy.

I like this explanation, topping up his balance then losing those fake coins to customers.  The more I hear about this, the more I think the 800k BTC was just GoxBux.

I couldn't read the whole thing, Gavin was extremely nice talking to you.

didn't include fee, then tried to send to myself, last try? :P

I agree, I frequent many forums that are not directly related to bitcoin.  The overwhelming response from people in these threads is "Well looks like I'm too late now, how do I buy some LTC".
So the advantage Litecoin has at the moment is a psychological one.  Until we move to mBTC this will continue to happen.

No, lets clear this up:

Atoms in the Universe:

I think you mean 4.53 million in USD

Because I couldn't get any other unit to even show up on the graph

Bubbles can only really be called once they have burst, so you can't say that this is or isn't a bubble.  It also depends on what time frame you are looking at.  People called $32 and $266 bubbles, yet in the overall scheme of things they were completely wrong.
There will be a final Bitcoin bubble one day, one that doesn't go past its all time high, but you will only know after the fact.  $10k, $100k, $1M, $10M etc... no one knows.

I like his reaction when told Bitcoin was now $400...

"my government is preventing money from flowing into the country"
Well lets fix that..

Yes and people were saying this at $200 a few weeks back.  My point is you can't call the top, which means you can't call it a bubble yet.
PS. For you, just spread your purchases out over months.

I hear you, but how easy is it to withdraw your "physical" bitcoins compared to requesting delivery of your gold bars.  Any company trying to pull a swifty here will find out that creating paper bitcoins will quickly lead to a world of hurt.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:44:32
Yes just used the observable taken from Wikipedia - "The observable universe is a sphere with a diameter of about 29 gigaparsecs (8.8×10^26 meters)."

I think I was a couple of years early when I suggested it.  
I accepted bitcoin in my store using bitpay.  Over 500 orders later, not 1 person used it :(

Atoms in the universe is roughly 10^80, a much bigger number than 2^160.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:40:26
Atoms in universe is quite a bit more than Bitcoin addresses (addresses then don't show up :P).  Grains of sand (on Earth) is minuscule.  Chose linear scale because of psychological impact ;).  Could probably do a lot more in a log scale though, cells in human body, stars in the universe etc... take your pick.

Nice explanation and all, even if a little pretentious. Why are people still selling on MtGox then?  As soon as people stop selling on MtGox, the weighted average price will take a nose dive. Until that time, you have to at least take into account the price on MtGox because of the huge amount of volume there.  If it is taking months for people to get their money, then the majority of people don't seem to care.

Go to space and pay for it using Bitcoins... I like the world we now live in.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:53:07
I see your point now, you could have explained yourself a bit more clearly.  I guess I was trying to show how really small that unit is.  A milli unit is something the human brain can still fathom.  So dividing that into god knows how many units seems more impressive than adding 3 zeros and making the base unit meter.
