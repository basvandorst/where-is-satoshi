this guy gets it.

Great podcast and while Joe didn't seem to entirely get it, I'm pretty sure he'll be convinced soon enough once he starts researching it. Andreas is a great asset for the bitcoin community.

Open transactions seems like it has the most promise out of all of them. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:49:34
Thanks for the insightful response. Glad to know that this could work in theory.

Care to explain why? Is it because the idea of life extension seems dumb to you or is the idea of using a smart contract in this way not practical?

If they want to inspire people they shouldn't be attempting to premine. Don't get me wrong, I think the idea of Ethereum could be amazing if it was actually created in earnest but their current funding model has an unpleasant air of greed for a lot of folks.

I'm moving there in less than a year so this is fantastic news. Thanks OP.

Can't wait to buy one of these.

Thanks!

How so? Its not as if the hacked coins are destroyed and therefore supply is decreased.

Thank you bro!

haha, lets all hope the actual sign up is many decades away buddy. We're living in exciting times now with the advent of Bitcoin and I would hate to miss any of it.

Who broke up? I missed the stream and its not archived.

This was my favorite podcast in this space. Really bummed me out to hear what happened. Major respect to Chris for sticking to the principles of the show. Gonna miss Junseth a lot.

Only if he's an idiot.

My thoughts exactly. Well said.

Not sure why everyone in this thread is still so butthurt about the foundation. Ever since Bruce has taken the reigns I've been very happy with the direction the Foundation has gone in.

I would honestly sell all my bitcoins the day that I hear you're out.

Forgive my ignorance, but why is that?
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:53:53
Why so surprised?
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:43:35
Good job OP. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:04:23
Thanks for for posting that TED talk. It was very insightful and confirmed much of my own assumptions on the idea. 
However, the candle problem only showed that intrinsic motivation helps to perform a job faster, not that it wouldn't be performed at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:02:17
So true brother.
