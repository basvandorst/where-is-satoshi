I think it speaks volumes that a coin released weeks ago, is upsetting the bitcoin and litecoin community, they call it a scam and say they're just trying to protect everyone from losing money.  I've made a considerable amount mining paycoin from GAW, much more than I ever made mining Bitcoin or Litecoin or any of the other numerous coins I've tried.  
My personal experience with GAW has been awesome; from buying my first Bitcoin mining hardware in 2013 to Scypt Asic miners to Hashlets cloud miners to Paycoin.  Who would have thought that a small investment with them would turn into a sizeable amount.  So I guess you could call me a fanboy, but my investments with them has been nothing but pure profit.

I'm not a dedicated supporter of GAW:  I'm only worried about myself and so are you....   This whole cult mentality of this coin vs this coin is bullshit.   
I'm investing into GAW because they might finally bring cryptocurrency to the masses in the form of debit cards.  Which is something you should want too!  I would love it if I could just swipe my card and pay in Bitcoin or PayCoin or WhateverTheFuckCoin.

I'm a PayCoin investor, I bought about $500 worth of hashlets from GAW in August 2014, and about the same time I spent thousands on Bitcoin mining hardware.  I'm making more in a day from that initial $500 dollar investment in GAW than I would make in a month from the thousands of dollars worth of BitCoin hardware.  Even with the price at half of what it should be on Paycoin.
Am I scared or are you just confused and don't know what you're talking about?

Seems to me like everyone is scared, because if GAW pulls off everything they say they are going to do (debit cards, marketplaces etc)-- they will pass BitCoin in market cap.  That's a big IF, but something I would be willing to take a chance on with my spare change.  
I'll invest into PayCoin's innovations rather than Bitcoin's stagnation anyday of the week.
