this almost religious interpretation of the purity of Bitcoin is why I stopped reading this sub for over a year in the past.  theymos and company (you included) sound like cultists with this particular subject.  unchanging software is how software dies, not how it lives forever, especially when it's a global product and requirements and use cases are constantly being refined through an iterative real world experiment.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:07:19
So development on bitcoin has stopped altogether? Any change to the software at all makes it a new alt-coin by that logic.  Or do you change your measuring stick as you go and allow some changes but not others?

@_date: 2017-11-02 17:08:21
velocity is not the supply of coins.  the integral of the velocity with respect to time is the supply of coins.  velocity is coins per unit of time (e.g. 12.5coins/10 minutes).  supply is simply number of coins (e.g. 21 million).  acceleration is the change in the velocity, which is a stair-step function of -25coins/10 minutes/instantaneous time, 0, -12.5 coins/10minutes/instantaneous time, 0, -6.25 coins/10minutes/instantaneous time, 0, ...
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:03:13
Wow, where did you fail so miserably at physics?


Debatable.  It depends on whether you think bitcoin started at the genesis block (velocity = 50coins/10 mins) or if it started at code compilation (velocity = 0)


You just described velocity, not acceleration.  The acceleration was 0 coins/10 minutes/instantaneous time at this point.  Block 0 was 50/10min, block 1 was 50/10min, block 2 was 50/10min, ... block n was 50/10 minute, until the next halving.  That's a constant velocity from block 0 to n, which means 0 acceleration.  At the first halving the velocity went from 50 coins/10mins to 25 coins/10 minutes, which is a `-25 coins/10 minute/instantaneous time` acceleration.  And then the acceleration became 0 again until the next halving.  ~~It's a stair-step acceleration function.~~  It actually is a flat line with spikes at each moment when a new block was found at the new halving point.


The only way this would happen is if your acceleration is positive.  As soon as you let off the gas, the acceleration rapidly approaches zero (and in a world with friction and wind resistance becomes negative).


This is so incredibly wrong and is probably why you don't understand the rest of it.  In a car, the distance traveled would be akin to the supply.  When you brake, you're still covering distance on the ground.  You have a positive velocity, and a negative acceleration.  This means the supply is increasing (you're traveling a distance towards the red light), but at a slowing rate (you're now going 12.5mph instead of 25mph).

stocks exist to generate capital for businesses to conduct business.  why would that go away?  companies need external money to grow.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:53:05
dude, the units for acceleration are distance/time/time  (the change of coins mined per 10 minutes)
the units for velocity are distance/time + direction   (coins mined per 10 minutes on a chain)
the units for position are distance  (count of coins)
yes, it is mathematically wrong because your units are wrong.

I had 11.42 coins at the peak of my holdings.  Sold at $412.  Thanks Mike Hearn for your convincing words.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:16:24
you just defined time in your world to be ticks of transactions instead of seconds.  that's the only difference.  you didn't change the mathematical relationship between acceleration, velocity, and displacement where acceleration is the 2nd derivative of the displacement with respect to time and velocity is the first derivative of displacement with respect to time.
    a(t) = v'(t) = d''(t)
give it up man
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:46:18
that's not correct.  bitcoin can have 0 acceleration and a positive velocity and it would continue like that forever, with a linear increase to supply.  the velocity is going to zero because the acceleration is negative and has been from the start.

you pay ordinary income tax on the market value of your services.  say $6k of salary.  then when you spend it your cost basis is $6k and you can incur a loss or gain depending on the sale price.  same thing happens when you're granted RSUs at a public company.

why did he live like a monk for 2 years if he just took out a loan for the money?  What does that have to do with the story?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:43:23
this analogy is completely wrong.  Bitcoin started at t^0 with 0 acceleration and a velocity of 50 bitcoins/10 minutes or whatever it was at first.  then it has been negatively accelerating (braking) with each halving.  it never touched the gas pedal.

I don't know a single alcoholic/drug addict in my field and I've been working aerospace and fintech for 10 years now in and out of SV startups, fortune top 20 best places to work, and govt contracting.  the people I know working 60+ hour weeks are top 1-3% earners in the US, work long hours voluntarily because they love what they do, and still make time for travel, relationships, friends, family, exercise, and hobbies.  I've personally worked 70-80 hour weeks and have been on teams that launched satellites into space and created products that have millions of users.  I don't regret any of it and actually miss those times when things settle back down into a normal routine.

you definitely do not want to pay cash for a home or pay it off early.  you want to put down as absolutely little as possible to avoid mortgage insurance and that's it. you want inflation to run away with your outstanding debt and principle value of the home and lower your true cost of ownership.

One problem I see is that the size is huge (2147 bytes) compared to the average size of about 266 bytes.  Your fee per kB is considerably lower than it should be to get into the next few blocks.  You actually didn't pay enough, which shouts even louder at how absurd bitcoin has become.  Realistically, if you wanted to get in the next 6 blocks your fee should have been around 0.007 based on this site's assessment    But then you're looking at a fee of $16.

Ideally, the IRS would allow free exchange without always pinning everything back to the USD.  Since it's property, they should just turn a blind eye to it like we have in practice for craigslist sales.  there is a whole industry of getting stuff for free on CL then turning around and reselling it.  Nobody is tracking those gains and reporting them.
If I buy magic internet money for basically free in 2012 and then sell it for more later on, then good for me and don't get this commingled with my tax filing.

does not change anything mentioned.  buying things in btc still prompts a capital gain or loss that's taxable, making bitcoin a rather useless currency in many countries.
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:08:20
the fundamentals of bitcoin actually have it already marked as a failed experiment.  
- $15-20 to make a transfer in a reasonable amount of time.
- waiting a minimum of 10 minutes per tx
- chaotic price swings
- crazy electricity consumption, which is the last thing the world needs right now
- centralized maintenance by a few developers with autism
- centralized control of the blockchain by chinese mining pools
- treated as a capital asset introducing huge IRS concerns, reducing liquidity.  disregarding tax implications could result in jail time.
the anti-establishment lure and speculative investment properties of bitcoin keep it in the spotlight.  it's a horrible currency though, and will likely lose out to an alt coin once the first-to-market appeal wears off with time.
