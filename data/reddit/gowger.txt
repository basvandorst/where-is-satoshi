I don't think a bank bailout is the way forward, community oriented or not. Only non centralised alternatives to the way things have worked in traditional finance should be allowed to survive.

I bought one of their cold storage devices more to support them than because I really wanted it but it's a handy little yoke indeed :-)

Well that clears a few things up! So is bitcoin really going to survive when cheaper, faster and more agile alternatives exist? If miners elect to hold bitcoin back from adaptation, and hence further adoption then it's fairly obvious that it will be replaced.

It strikes me that the views expressed in the post do not give enough concern to the fact that the non mining users are where the value in the fees and reward actually come from. Most users could not care less about the amount of hashing power on any given chain. Typical users only care about features. If the forked chain's tokens are trading low value then that hits the mining reward. If the transaction volume goes to the more functional chain then the fork will have lower transaction fees. Chain splits have been shown to decrease the overall sum total value due to the reduced network effect, particularly when the spilt is more contentious, only recovering when the failed fork is abandoned. Although I understand the sentiment, I still can't see how this fork will help anyone at all. I still believe the miners are defeating themselves by supporting it.

Surely the value of bitcoin itself would be realised if it can be shown to scale to the level of mainstream payment networks, and therefore miners would be rewarded in proportion to that realised value.

FAQ: "Because we act as the counterparty for all bitcoin to bitmoney conversions, we can keep our costs low. In all other circumstances, moving value within Bitreserve is 100% free."
Reality: Deposit BTC into XAU wallet, 2.45% commission
Transfer XAU backed BTC into any other card, 4.05% commission! Transfer XAU backed BTC to external address, 4.05% commission. 
Search their website and you will find no mention of 4.05% anywhere, WTF?

1. accrue as much debt as possible 2. spend it all on cryptocurrencies 3. declare bankruptcy

Would be interesting if possible to compare on a per transaction basis, to plot potential energy scalability roadmap
