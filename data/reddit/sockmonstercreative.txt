Thank you! That's awesome! I'm playing with text now just in case.

Each one is intended for a target audience or maybe a specific place in a city.  So the suit would be for more of a metropolitan are, intended to give the idea that bitcoin benefits business.  The cow and the boy for those interested in world reconciliation, intended to reference the remittance industry.  The woman doing laundry to appeal to pintrest-loving ladies, intended to reference what bitcoin can do to empower women.  The parrot, hummingbird and geometric one with the lines more to show the collision of the technical world and organic world in a less dystopian way for those who fear change.  Each of those with a more target audience in terms of who may find it appealing.  The smoking girl with the cat is for a more youthful area of town and gets at the whole rebellious side of bitcoin without being overtly subversive.  And the waves I just thought would look good from a long ways away.

This is exactly what I had in mind. Thank you!

Here is my submission.  There are a couple other edits I'll be adding. 
Let me know what you think!
EDIT: Here's one with the alternate bitcoin logo
EDIT 2: More colors!

Thank you for the album view!

There is not supposed to be a unifying theme. The idea is to make them visually appealing to a variety of people so that people see the poster, find it interesting and discover that it's "another one of those bitcoin posters."
That's a good point about my logo and I can edit them and make them smaller. I am just starting out and I suppose wanted a little marketing opportunity for myself. :) Regardless, I will edit them and thank you for your feedback!

Thank you, kind stranger!

Hey, thanks for sharing! 
Your poster is much more clearly "on topic" than mine. 
One thing: would you consider removing "revolution" from it? I would love for bitcoin to be something that is revolutionary but doesn't advertise itself as something necessarily subversive. There will already be enough controversy around it without having to claim itself as controversial.

That is exactly what I hoped would happen with these! Thank you!
Just like was drawn to the hummingbird, I'm hoping that there's a little something that draws everyone. :)
