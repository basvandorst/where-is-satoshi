This doesn't jibe with the other tweet this morning saying that someone was just flat out sending a bunch of Craig Wright's documents and info to the press for a while.
I do like "the facts are evolving" line, because this is literally true, the "facts" are evolving, and changing as they need to, to make Craig Wright look less bad.

I watched that whole video, and there was a second one with the same staff member, but the audio was SUPER quiet (filmed on a different day).
I had the same impression 100% that the programmer was going "Oh yes of course", and kind of smiling in a way that I couldn't place, it was either:
1. This guy is a fool and I'm agreeing with him
2. Just being nervous on camera
3. Maybe just smiling awkwardly because he had been sort of corrected - I do this sometimes
I didn't actually get the idea there were investors, but that could be true. I forget which of the 2 videos but on one, a lady off camera was saying "So you can do these things? It's possible?" and Craig said, in a kind of assholey way, "Of course we can".. but it wasn't SUPER assholey, it may have been super standard for Australia really. I'm from Canada and we have a MUCH different standard.
@_date: 2015-12-09 21:12:51
Right, there's that common rule, I forget what it's called, but the idea is that any headline that poses a question can always be answered with NO. So for instance "Could cranberries be the breakthrough in curing multiple sclerosis?" is the kind of non-commital yet sensational headline that editors love to throw around, and then later they can go "Heeeey we never said they WERE the cure".
But what gets me is that simply by choosing to publish these stories, you are ascribing some sort of importance to them. If Wired writes an article saying "This guy probably invented Bitcoin", then sure, they're not saying he FOR SURE did, but it's much, much different from saying "Here is a theory someone sent us".
And it blows my mind that these publications are printing this story to begin with, because right from the start, when they realized that the blog posts (which Wired emphasizes) were edited in 2013 to add Bitcoin references, that should be a huuuuuuge red flag, like just insanely large red flag that something is VERY shady about this whole thing. At that point they should have said "Okay we think we have this PGP information, but you know what, we better verify the hell out of it and make sure we really know that it's legit and not tampered with, because the other evidence has been tampered with".
I am not knowledgeable about PGP, but I read Andy Greenberg's book on cypherpunks, leakers, Assange, etc, and I thought he was completely on top of this stuff, and when I read the Wired piece I just kind of glossed over the PGP stuff and went "okay so the PDF is signed by Satoshi I guess, I don't understand all this but I trust Andy Greenberg". Pretty disappointing.

No this is true. Now I think of it, when I signed up this time, I *did* stick in my email address, so this time if I get logged out, I guess I can get a reminder of my username and password

Sure, but Bitcoin would never have received 50% of the coverage it has if it didn't have a cool backstory. 
Satoshi's own fault for creating a mysterious Japanese character creation myth that intrigues people like crazy. He shoulda written comic books instead.
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:25:20
Yeah they read the article and IMMEDIATELY prepared a tax case against him, within 3 hours.
@_date: 2015-12-09 21:00:34
btw probably 90% of my previous posts were also about Bitcoin controversies, mostly from the Dorian days lol. What can I say, I like the drama.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:55:54
Okay so wait, why would a guy who owns 10% or whatever of all existing Bitcoin create a trading company that uses a supercomputer to analyze Bitcoin.
Is he looking to uhh.. trade his position up to 100%?
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:11:33
It's quite possible that he has been under investigation for a long time, and well aware of it, or that he had tax problems in the past involving this guy - very hard to tell which it is.
I do know one thing though, when it comes to the veracity of whether he's Satoshi - so, so many frauds wind up being run by someone who had tax avoidance issues in the past, it's a very common thing to see. I wouldn't reach to presume how it could be related, but if you read a lot about frauds and people who deceive people for money, it's just an incredibly common pattern.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:07:39
He did list malware as one his main expertises on his blog header.
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:02:32
Yeah, he clearly wants to be "found", he edited his old blog posts to say he was Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:17:11
Uh huh, and Dread Pirate Roberts knew too much about Tor and never using unencrypted communcations to ever get caught, etc etc
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:14:33
And he has videos up on his Youtube channel where he talks about what his company is doing, and talks to an employee, and he says quite clearly that they do not mine Bitcoin and that the processors they have are not particularily good at mining. He does say something like "a few years ago they would have been average" or something.
If you watch the videos with his employee, they're very odd, they just show the employee working on a front-end tool that shows a bunch of network nodes that are mapped around the world in a nice 3D way, and he talks about "you can monitor that if all the computers over here are turned off, you can turn on all the computers here", and it's hard to really understand what they're working on. It WOULD be a hell of an elegant front-end tool for a botnet, but it'd be pretty overkill perhaps.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:47:45
I don't understand how the original reporters made this into a story to begin with. The PGP stuff is fairly confusing to people without a huge technical knowledge of encryption, so someone should have looked into this much more closely. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:13:22
That is basically ONLY funny to ideologues. The whole premise of "_____'s positive accomplishments would be the world's shortest book" is like humor that  85 year olds like. It's wack as hell.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:41:47
So far it seems like that, all I am pointing out is that we all said EXACTLY that about DPR until the day he got caught. THEN we found out all the dumb, dumb stuff he had done, but that took YEARS, even with people looking for him pretty hard.
Off topic now, but it truly was really crazy how they found him, after years of looking. The FBI guy or whoever just thought "I wonder if he promoted the site when it launched", and boom everything was simple, and anybody really could have done a lot of that research (save getting the info from Stackoverflow that had to be subpoenaed).
I doubt that a year from now we'll say "Oh look at this, Satoshi posted on experts-exchange.com 5 times in 2005 using his personal email address!" but who knows.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:34:18
You are trying to argue politics SO HARD and I don't care. All my reply said was that any joke that ends in "would be the world's shortest book" is an INSANELY corny joke and sounds like it'd be from the 1950s.
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:44:36
He was definitely in some big tax trouble, considering he wrote into his will that a part of his wealth was to be used to "expose" some tax official who supposedly persecuted him
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:06:35
I don't actually buy that he fabricated the story for this reason, BUT, let's say he DID do something that warranted his door kicked in, that could easily have been a years-long investigation.
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:13:18
He edited his old blog to say he invented Bitcoin, so yes, he did claim it, he just tried to do it sneakily (and failed)
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:34:26
Also can I mention a logical error people are making in a few comments here and the other thread: 
If you are going to say both these statements:
A. "He owns a huge amount of Bitcoins!"
and 
B. "He owns one of the fastest supercomputers in the world!"
You have to remember that causation can go in both directions here, which means B-&gt;A as well as A-&gt;B
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:59:56
I don't have the password to my old account, I used to post here and a few other subreddits a bit, got a new computer and got logged out, whatcha gonna do. I'm not a heavy duty redditor, but this time when I signed up, I at least added my email address, which I didn't do last time (hence no chance of password recovery)
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:24:02
I have also thought this, he seems very shady, and people DO love to lie about degrees they have.
The only thing on the other side is that this guy apparently has a bit of a hard-on about bragging that he gets 1 degree a year, and if you watch the start of the Bitcoin conference video where he says smarmily that he has lost count of how many degrees he has, it does make me think that he probably DOES go and get them all, just to look/feel smart.
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:06:33
I knew someone would remember it for me :)
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:12:40
It's funny, I watched that video and the Turing complete thing sounded impressive to me, then when the guy in the hat (I assume that's VaughPerling) said "Jeff Garzik just wrote about this" I thought "huh I wonder if that's where this guy got this idea"
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:06:19
Gynoplasty is correct on this, it says:
 "The PGP key associated with Nakamoto’s email address and references to an upcoming “cryptocurrency paper” and “triple entry accounting” were added sometime after 2013"

"for some reason" - uh yeah her looks and she's crazy
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:15:16
It is really so crazy that they didn't just report on it but put a big stamp of "yup this is true", when it's soooo speculative and there are SO many red flags. This could have been a passable story if it was framed like "so here's a new theory but there are a lot of holes", but maybe that would have been too weak for them after spending a month on it and counting on a lot of pageviews.

Whether you think it's him or not, this may be the spur to get Bitcoin back in the American media 24/7 and remind everyone about it, which was happening during the last great boom.
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:14:43
Yes, it could be him setting aside money to get even with one of their employees, OR it could be whatever shady stuff he was doing in order to get in trouble in the first place.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:11:43
This email SCREAMS someone acting. 
- It is written with tons of angry mispellings, as if the person sent it in in a fit of rage, yet it contains tons of paperwork that the person chose.
- The writer wrote 2 sentences, and 1 is them going painfully out of their way to out themselves as a supposed employee. If you prepared a "leak" like this for presumably a while (choosing and gathering documents to send), would you be completely flippant about giving a huge clue that could help track you down?
- So the story now is that his employees all knew he was Satoshi?
- From everything we know, if you wanted to get revenge on this guy, you wouldn't tell everyone he was a legendary figure who everyone respects like Satoshi, you'd send additional evidence to the ATO who he clearly in tons of trouble with.
The existence of someone shopping this around for a while also negates the idea of him being blackmailed to some degree.
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:18:17
And might I add, he really shames the "investigations" by Wired and Gizmodo, although a lot of people have shamed those already.

follow-up: this post is so good, it doesn't really belong in this thread, it should be its own thread. It doesn't really have anything to do with subject, and it also deserves a wider audience.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:31:30
Where is the money, where is the actual evidence.
One thing I find extremely interesting, that is only mentioned in passing in the Gizmodo article, is that the PDF the "hacker" provided is an UNFINISHED draft.
I could write an unfinished draft of me creating a Seychelles trust worth 2 billion dollars right now, and it wouldn't even be fraudulent or illegal, it's just an unfinished draft.
Where is the money. Meeting with lawyers or an accountant and telling him you have money doesn't mean anything - Bernie Madoff did this a million times, as have done millions of other people.

This is an amazing wrap-up that fits EVERYTHING, this is great, wow. NICE work!
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:10:27
Nope, my comparison is amazing and perfect.
This guy said "Oh surely Satoshi wouldn't do....."
And my point is that people used this EXACT reasoning about DPR for years. Everyone said "There is no way DPR will ever be caught he would NEVER do anything that isn't perfect", totally forgetting that humans do whatever they feel like.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:22:51
So many things don't add up here. If I'm being bold, I'm going to say that **on its face** there are **more** things that don't add up than in the Dorian story. At least Dorian had some really compelling, verifiable circumstantial evidence (his name, he lived a few blocks from Hal Finney, he was a computer guy).
So much of this evidence comes down to what is essentially hearsay: Almost all of the evidence is basically: 
"Craig Wright told this person that he was involved..."
"Craig Wright edited his blog posts so it hints strongly that he was involved"..."
"Craig Wright told his lawyers that he was involved..."
"Craig Wright wrote up a draft of an agreement saying he was involved..."
These would all be better evidence if it Craig Wright genuinely didn't want to seem involved, but I think everyone in this discussing agrees that there is a HUGE chance he leaked all this info himself and he CLEARLY wants to seem involved.
In which case, we require a lot better evidence that his own words.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:02:07
What do we have here: 7 tweets. 
Sourced from friends and family. I'd say this quality/level of evidence is about par for the course on this story. Maybe Gizmodo will launch a 30 day investigation into these 7 tweets.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:52:30
Plus it looks like the laptop was not brand new purchased by Gavin, so it could have been treated by Wright, and then repackaged as if it had never been opened. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:02:37
Probably Wright got in contact with him ahead of time and told him what he was about to announce. But also fuck this guy and Gavin for staying silent (from what I saw) when this was in full swing.
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:03:15
I'm saying that you're right, that IS the highest SINGLE form of proof available, BUT it's not definitive. Having the private keys does not equal being the creator. Craig Wright has already been shown to have been trying to recover his Florida friend's USB stick, which he seems to believe had the private keys, so if he suddenly did show up with the private keys, think what that means.

@_date: 2016-05-05 15:05:53
I would normally give people a lot of leeway for being conned, but this just seems like SUCH an extreme case. I mean, the guy was all but proven to be a con man in December, did so much dishonest stuff, etc. But I mean the whole point of Bitcoin is about trust, etc, and Gavin just goes "He has the personality of the guy I emailed and who would go to all the trouble to hack a hotel's wifi???"
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:12:20
The timezone stuff is terrible! Technical people can keep SUCH weird hours. You can't infer anything from that, nothing at all, the only reason people talk about that is because it's one of the only pieces of data we actually know about Satoshi, but it's terrible, noisy data.
The text analysis might be a bit better, but is still very, very speculative. It might add like 1% of support to a theory, but unless you find someone whose text analysis fits perfectly with Satoshi PRE-whitepaper, then it's not great.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:22:21
As much as it feels like it, this isn't an action movie, and Nicolas Cage isn't going to run in, and say that Craig Wright holds the secret key to unmasking the Illuminati. The guy is in tax trouble, he wants to con some investors, and he happens to be in a position to make some people think he's Satoshi, or so he thoughts. He went for this plan not because it was foolproof and genius, but because it had some percentage of working, and more importantly, he had nothing else he could go with.
History is full of con artists with terrible plans.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:07:28
I'm sure I read somewhere a description Gavin gave. There's a Youtube video of someone asking him about it too, which is short.

@_date: 2016-05-05 15:12:33
This is the thing that honest people always say about liars: "I think they actually believe their lies" - well they don't, or they'd get caught much faster, because they would go to extraordinary lengths to support their lies with dishonest acts (hacking hotel wifi, etc). This is just the natural thought of someone who is honest and literally can't imagine just lying non-stop.

This reporter is the BEST! He gets scammed by Wright, he writes an article and then people are yelling at him all day on Monday on Twitter and he's defending it like crazy, really strident, then he actually gets scammed himself for 5gbp, and he still calls the whole episode "an experiment" or whatever, not an outright fraud. Hahahah amazing, so good
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:59:22
The constant value people put on Satoshi's posting hours is so weird, it's SUCH irrelevant data. There are a tiny, TINY amount of situations where it could provide any useful information as to whether someone may or may not be Satoshi. 
People put way too much value on it because it's one of the only data points we really have on Satoshi. Like the 2-spaces-after-period thing. Really terrible stuff.

I don't know much about this honestly but you know how Craig Wright *supposedly* had 2 supercomputers at his disposable? If he truly had them and they were as fast as he claims, what are the odds he could have brute forced even a single private key and maybe fluked out and gotten an early coin?

@_date: 2016-05-06 01:32:15
I just said I hate this guy but maybe I like him... what I like is that him and the Ian Grigg guy immediately realized that Craig Wright is a scammer and just went "ok fuck it, let's jump in on this!" and started their own bullshitty scam, because they know CSW can't do anything about it.
They're like "oh hey we're part of the Tulip Trust too!" and CSW is like ".... uh ok". It's like the plot of that old show Remington Steele where a lady investigator makes up a fictional guy to supposedly own her detective agency, then one day a guy comes in saying "Oh yeah that's me, what's up everyone"
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:32:20
To make it look like a certain guy was part of the company for later on when perhaps they will recover lots of BTC that Kleiman may own, and Wright puts forward a claim on them like "Not only was he part of this trust, he was even a director of my company"

That's true BUT not how it's most often (mis)used
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:59:23
I think they're right and wrong: It probably *is* possible to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, but it would be very very very hard, and just possessing the keys wouldn't prove it. In Wright's specific case, people would immediately say "Ahhh, so his friend in Florida was Satoshi!" (I would be one of those people)
@_date: 2016-05-05 03:16:45

Doubling the amount of searches seems really low for a news story of this supposed importance. Imagine if the BBC wrote a story saying "This is who really killed JFK" and searches only doubled - you'd assume nobody really cared.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:19:36
To me, every article laying out some new suspect always seems believable. The latest one saying that David Kleiman probably invented it is also very believable, and if you just read it in isolation, you'd probably be 100% convinced.
I watched some non-fiction TV show a few years ago where a guy who used to work for the CIA or similar agency was old, on his deathbed, and admitted that he was part of the conspiracy to kill JFK, and seemed completely believable. Then I forget the exact details, but at some point they mentioned that there are like 150 guys who have had equally believable stories exactly like this on their deathbed "I pulled the trigger on JFK", etc.
@_date: 2016-05-05 03:17:32
lol I have had 2 or 3 reddit usernames over the years, but I mostly go on Twitter, I only ever come on here when there's Bitcoin drama
@_date: 2016-05-08 03:34:50
I have to say this: I've posted a LOT about the Craig Wright thing on here, and in 1 comment I believe I said something mean about Gavin's silence after being hoodwinked, but I really feel bad about it. Not because of this tweet, but this:
From what I've seen, Gavin seems to be a genuine guy who really wants what's best for Bitcoin, and when he got involved in it, it was not as huge a thing as it is now. 
I don't know of any open source projects that have grown in importance as much as Bitcoin has. There are hundreds of thousands of OSS projects that have been launched by individuals, then an extra developer (or more) has jumped on board, but these projects have not exploded - maybe they got popular, but nothing crazy. Up until a certain point, Bitcoin was one of these, and Gavin was one of the kind programmers who contributed to a piece of open source software that he was interested in, and believed in.
So at some point, Bitcoin explodes, and Gavin is in a position that few people have been in. Does he happen to be magically qualified to handle everything perfectly? No. Did he really do anything mean-spirited or evil? I haven't seen evidence of this. Did Craig Wright take advantage of him and trick him? All signs point to yes.
I have a little tangent here: I have a number of people who I've only communicated with online, and some of them feel like really good friends to me, and I like them a lot. For the most part, none of them are very anonymous, but I can think of at least one in particular who is, and if someone contacted me, said they were this guy, and convinced me of it, and then I found out that they were actually just impersonating the guy, and they met me face to face, pretended to be this guy, lied to me, stole this guy's identity, went out of their way to deceive me - I can't really imagine how I'd feel when I found out. I wouldn't cry or anything, but I'm sure that would be a weird, confusing punch to the gut, even WITHOUT a huge community of people screaming at me that I'm an idiot for believing the guy.
I don't know what I'm saying, but I do think it's easy to judge Gavin for making some mistakes that okay, a lot of people might not make, but in the end, the guy isn't TRYING to cause trouble (unless you believe he's a CIA sleeper agent and all that bs), and I feel bad for my comment where I was mean to him.

@_date: 2016-05-06 01:14:27
Maybe just a courtesy to Gavin, especially as he is someone who interacted with Satoshi. If Wright WAS the real SN, it'd be a nice thing to meet up with Gavin, get introduced, give him a preview, etc.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:22:08
This guy is on such a weak scammer level that he's still doing 2 spaces after every period, thinking that will convince anyone. This is probably why he swapped out the jpg for actual text, so people could see that. We're supposed to go "Well nothing else about how Satoshi communicated rings true with this guy BUT somehow he just couldn't stop doing the spaces." So half-assed

I don't have any opinion on block size issues, it's too technical for me. But moreso, Wright is just such an incredibly funny buffoon, just a comically inept con man, that this drama is hilarious. In the past few weeks I was actually telling my girlfriend all about Wright, based on the December drama, and then when I woke up the other day, she had already been up and watching the BBC reporting and told me about it, at which point I looked it up and laughed so hard, basically "Oh my god this is the guy I told you about, he's at it AGAIN!"
My last username had maybe 100 posts, half about Bitcoin stuff and half about the podcast Serial.
So I understand, you just think it's odd, but I have no agenda. I'll surely have a new username when I somehow get logged out of this one, because I have no clue what my password is, or if I even created one.

It was a jpg to start, of the text, but he changed it so he could make it clear he was doing the 2 spaces thing.

I am not being facetious here, but what proof do we have that this guy definitely is NOT Satoshi? I always thought it was weird how fast he got discounted. For a community that likes to talk about Occam's Razor, etc, this guy has the SAME NAME and he told a reporter "I'm not involved with that anymore". 
Yeah yeah he said he meant something else, but didn't we all just give him the benefit of the doubt WAY too fast???? Is there info I don't know that REALLY controverts him being Satoshi?
Personally, the one thing I do think is that Hal Finney is somehow involved with this guy's story. Didn't they live 2 blocks apart? At the very minimum, Finney heard someone say this guy's name, got it in his head because it's catchy, then suggested it as a name for the real Satoshi or something.

"I am so sad that I may have tainted Gavin and Jon's credibility, and I wish there was something I can do but I can only say I'm sorry. I mean I could just prove I have the coins but nah"

lol yes, genius.

What details are we talking here? As far as details that Gavin himself could have, I'm unsure what we're saying is missing.

Thanks, I honestly was so sure of this happening, I wish I could somehow have bet money on it.

This seems like one of his only outs at some point. Either "Oh damnit I lost the key to block 1" or "Listen I'm fed up with this whole thing, I'm going back into seclusion, believe whatever you want".
My money would be on the latter I guess, because saying he doesn't have access to all that money hurts his chances at future scams.
