So many posts discuss the problem, but not the solution...
What do I do given this scenario:
I have 100 Bitcoins in my qt wallet on my pc. I'm going shopping for the day, so I need 1 Bitcoin. What do I do?
Okay, so I have this 1 bitcoin, and I buy something for 30 dollars. At that moment, based on what you said I should do to take that 1 bitcoin out, where will the remaining 60 dollars go? How do I get it back to make purchases later that afternoon for dinner? Back to my pc wallet?

This. And because people are trading alt coins.

Could you explain why you are getting fees put on your money? I thought fees at this point were voluntary, or not part of the system yet...

But here is what I'm saying, and why this is so fucked up. I have my "home base" wallet. Now, I don't want to and physically can't take the computer with me, so I move the money that I want to go to the store with to this wallet on my phone. So i have my 1 bitcoin in my mobile wallet, the change goes into my mobile wallet, in a new 'account', then when I'm done, I send that money from my mobile wallet to the new "account" that got set up from getting change from 100 bitcoins minus the one I wanted to take with me to go shopping. Is that right?

I understand this process is necessary, and is thoroughly explained for people wanting to take the security, but this is a lot of work just to make sure your money is secure. It's hard to believe it's that difficult for the average user to protect themself.

When you say e-mail the wallet - what file am I e-mailing and putting on my USB stick?

This was true a long time ago, when there wasn't porn for free. Most porn studios picked HD DVD first, and we see how that worked out.

How did I pay for my item? That was skipped.
