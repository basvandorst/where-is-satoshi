Likewise, confirmation of receipt from coinbase arrived almost as soon as I clicked the transfer button.

Seeing all this faff about MtGox issues building up I decided to get my BTC out just there. Made a transfer to my coinbase account, expecting to have to wait days, but less than 10s later it was there. 
Don't stress. If you want to get your BTC out just do it.

Ok, so has now gone from pretty intense, vague, and sweeping speculation to full blown conspiracy theories...

It's not just about the car though, it's about the lack of community in Bitcoin that is so prevalent in @_date: 2017-02-09 13:35:07
Way to jinx it!

Not  fan of using the rose on there for a supposedly UK note since the Rose is exclusively the emblem of England. Also, I feel that by omitting the '0' which is part of the '0.1BTC' it could easily be misleading if you weren't familiar with the notes.

Just sold a fraction of my holdings and got back my initial investment. Seemed like a safe and sensible thing to do but it was tough since I know it could continue to rise. I'm not out of the game though, but everything from here on is bonus, wherever the value ends up!

Fun fact: The root of the website doesn't automatically load into the index.

I'm in a similar boat, bought in last week at around the $1000 mark, and even picked up another 0.5 last night at a similar time as you. This is my first ever investment too,  and I'm not sure if I'm confident or reckless right now.. Just gotta ride it out for the long haul I suppose. It is tough to know when to buy when you can't predict when it'll actually bottom out and turn around.
