Donate to a local homeless program (not a shelter). 
There have been cuts in govt funding for homelessness rehabilitation programs but an increase in funding for emergency shelters!
Thanks for being a good dude.  I’d do the same if I were in your position.

ERC20 have to settle in Eth when going to fiat, so when an ERC20 ico token needs to pay for operations, not catastrophic by any means but will be strong downside pressure on the price over time

Bitcoin is a valuable means of providing investment into projects that cannot get investment through traditional channels.
Spending and investing are two different things.
For example, Bitcoin makes for a great cash-flow insurance mechanism... as an escrow account or surety against "bad stuff happening"
