Thanks will re-word.

Not that ive seen yet.  I secured my important accounts afterwards.  I signed up for life lock and credit monitoring as a precaution as well.  Pretty sure this was a targeted btc hack...but I'm keeping a keen eye open.

Like I said... This wasn't his first time around the block.  Simple Google searches of his address brings up massive amounts of information. The exchange merely confirmed what I was able to find myself.  This guy did a very poor job of erasing his tracks... Don't even think he tried.  
I know exactly where you are coming from, and I won't comment any further.  Thanks again for your time! 
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:45:35
That was part of it.  Also working with the exchanges gave me lots of info. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:40:40
Haha I actually surprised myself as well.  I'd consider myself tech savvy and computer savvy to a degree. I was going to write up a big blog post with all my methods at some point in the future.  
Lots of googling, block chain analysis, ip analysis etc.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:54:26
No clue what you are talking about.  This is a serious post.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:16:21
This guy has actually been around the block with other attacks, so it's not only me :)
Thanks for looking out though. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:36:54
I'll plan on doing that in the near future, thanks!

I'll see if I can share anything later, but the virus would point directly to my hacker...and I don't want to put those details here.  I was able to decompile some of it.. So I know exactly what the virus did.  Most of it was obfuscated.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:44:25
They gave me a name and email that was used alongside the culprits btc address -  have direct links as part of my block chain analysis.  This name and email matches up to information contained in Metadata related to the virus.  Sorry for being vague again. 
And another exchange told me to wait and hear back from the authorities based on what I submitted to them.  Which sounds like a good sign to me, because if this guy had no BTC there.. They would just tell me that and move on.

Valued at 3to 4k now, but how do you when I bought it?  If you think it's nothing,  then you don't have anything constructive to add.  Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:43:24
Maybe in the future if this goes no where fast.  Again, don't want to throw off the culprit.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:42:46
It was.  The attack compromised my identity and the attacker was able to force his way to my wallet password.  It was my mistake not to use better passwords.  
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:22:13
Yes, let's go after bitfinex for being good guys... Come on man.. Let's be serious.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:17:35
If caught, this guy wasn't careful at all.. Almost dumb.  He deserves to be brought down on sheer stupidity alone. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:33:43
Not running anywhere.  What can of worms?  See my other post.  Sometimes we need to be human beings and Fuck the red tape when something time sensitive needs to be done.  I applaud those who helped me track down a repeated offender, hacker thief, idiot.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:07:17
Thanks for your input.  Now go fuck a goat.

Never heard of Mike from coin fire.. Have more info? I'll do some searching later on. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:04:51
Thanks bud.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:03:28
Yes, Windows.  AV almost caught it but the damage was done. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:31:17
They already knew about this guy even before I said a word to them, so they did some research themselves.  Fuck hackers, I'm glad they were able to help out.  Why protect his identity? 
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:38:48
Already did, but thanks!  Have all the info I need from that end.  
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:14:04
I had direct proof that my coins were related to transactions on that exchange, so they were willing to help as long as I filed the complaint.  
If I said Bitfinex, does that change anything? 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:04:39
Thanks for your help.  Good bye.  Hope karma bites you in the ass
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:53:38
Is that important?  One of the legitimate ones.  Btce was unhelpful for the most part but they have this guy's account.
Sorry didn't mean to sound rude.. Just again don't want to give out too much information.  
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:44:03
Where is the old version your have in the screenshot?
