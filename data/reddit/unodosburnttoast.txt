It puts Bitcoin in a difficult spot, right? In order to promote adoption, you want people to develop services that make the commonfolk want to use bitcoin over fiat. However, a vast majority of these services and convenient features break Bitcoin's most cautionary motto. Personally I think the motto needs to go in favor of some form of crowdsourced regulatory body, but I've had a really hard time fleshing out exactly what that would look like.

C'mon man, the wording they were using directly corresponds to basic econ 101. Pushing the curve to the right is sort of like "a rising tide lifts all boats" mantra. They *know* demand is not the same as price, neither do all the econ professors who teach this. It's just a useful way of visualizing and simplifying certain markets. Their point is hardly irrelevant and striking it down because you don't like the specifics of the wording is hardly good discourse.

Now hold on a sec, I'm a BTC hodler and tech optimist. I'm just making sure that this system I believe in stands on strong legs, not platitudes that get struck down whenever someone who took more than 4 credits of college econ chimes in. If you want to go our separate ways on this discussion, that's cool, but I'm here to make sure bitcoin stands on conceptually accurate ideology, not this bogus memeable bullshit. Don't get all "oOooOoo I'm being trolled I'm done here" on me now.

Good news everybody! You know that cryptocurrency concept about how you won't be able to be tracked, nobody will know who you are and what you're purchasing, that thing?

I'm not connecting the two clauses of your first sentence, help me understand better. What is your definition of debt, and what is your definition of paying back? Because in my mind with my definitions, this is a perfectly valid example of paying down debt:
You and I agree that today, you'll give me $100. Every month for the next year, I will pay you $10 (so you get your money back + interest). At the end of the 12 months, I have paid you $120. I am no longer indebted to you, as I have paid it back.

I'm a BTC hodler and optimist, but in this list...
1: An area of investment that has allowed us to break free of the whims of the natural elements and live safe (even luxurious) lives. Prevents death/disease, infinitely increases standard of living versus homeless lifestyle. 
2: An instrument used for generating reliable, stable income. Got a ton of extra cash you don't need right now? How about you take a paycheck of X dollars once a month for the next ten years on top of your normal job?
3: A way to invest and propel forward whatever vision of the future you see fit (not just the bitcoin dream - clean energy, AI, manufacturing, automotive, literally anything you want to feed and root for with your cash, you can feed here)
4: All those people you invested in from  need a place to stay from 9-5, 5 days a week, right? Bonus points if its a tech company who has oodles of cash to blow.
5: Literally everybody on Earth needs food to live. Might not be the happy-go-lucky socialist ethics some champion, but some take advantage of that need.
6: IMO the "use case" for gold died out a while ago and this is just the old regime continuing forward. It's my wish this someday is replaced with BTC.
7: A jargon-filled, tech-heavy investment vehicle with massive splits in its fanbase and with wildly different opinions on its purpose and use. Its greatest use case is ultimately only truly useful for those oppressed by corrupt governments and financial systems, yet high schoolers across America have found a way to turn it into a get-rich-quick platitude. People who are scammed are frequently ridiculed with "NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR BITCOIN HURR HURR" and the convenience factor of the reigning champion, modern-day banks, is unmatched. So if you don't have a sense of paranoia about big banks, there is very little reason to switch to bitcoin.
But yeah, if bitcoin ever finds a way to be as useful as the concept of a house, lmk. HODL onwards.

That's exactly the point. You buy a gigantic apartment complex for 500m, you now have a 500m asset that is paying you monthly rent. Your net worth hasn't gone down. You are still getting richer by the month. Your liquid capital simply shifted to concrete assets. It's far more stable than bitcoin from any definition of the word, even if its less sexy and has a lower ceiling.
You realistically can't "spend" a billion dollars in that it takes conscious effort to frivolously spend away 1,000,000,000 USD. Most big-ticket items you buy will preserve a good chunk of its value (houses, cars, private jets) and others will give you a return on your investment and give you even more money than you started with (commercial real estate, private equity). You'd have to buy a billion dollars of candy bars and hookers to truly "spend" it away, which I'm not advocating. Use your fortunate position to ensure that everyone with your last name for the next 100 years is born into fuck-you privilege, which is what many of these billionaires you speak of are already doing. Most of them have their wealth tied up in things, they aren't just sitting with a billion-dollar bank account deciding whether to piss it away or invest it.

By how much is it accelerating? How much has it accelerated in the past 1, 2, 5, 10 years? I don't care that my dollar is worth 1% of what it was 150 years ago, I wasn't alive back then. I care about what my currency is worth relative to the past decade or past few years. And a cursory google search shows that barring some volatility here and there, [my dollar is ultimately worth the same as it was in 1980]( Do you think this is a valid metric/chart?
And all debt is solved one of TWO ways: payback, or default. To claim that one of those is guaranteed is only a probability game, nothing is certain.

Large financial institutions are powerful, which makes it tempting to try and win them over, but they will not act in Bitcoin's best interest. It is that simple.
No ETF, no derivatives. You want to promote mass adoption? Start an incredible business and accept bitcoin. Sell a must-have product and accept bitcoin. Don't sit idly by in hopes that companies with poor moral track records suddenly reverse course and use their power to help bitcoin. If you cheat and try to have one of the financial titans do it for you, you're going to have a bad time.

Hate to jump in here halfway through, but when the stock loses value, that's generally considered "the company doing bad". The point of a crash is, as you said, that everything loses value. So the banks aren't really winning from this since they're losing on all areas of the board. Clients are pulling their money out to pay bills, businesses aren't paying back the loans these banks depend on, their investment choices are all doing poorly, etc. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:46:08
You know what a billy of USD buys you that bitcoin can't yet? Apartment complexes, yachts, businesses, etc. BTC might not ever go up again. We have plenty of reasons to believe it will, a great deal of them valid, but that 1B could be 500M tomorrow. Sort out your taxes and get in on a few hundred-unit buildings, fund some promising companies, buy your yacht, and all of a sudden you and your childrens' childrens' children are rich for the rest of your life no matter what bitcoin does.
Turning your 1b to 100B if we (ever) hit the 1m price mark for 1 BTC sounds really rosy, sure. But if you put 500m into an apartment complex doing 6% returns,  it doesn't matter. You're getting a 2.5m check a MONTH for the rest of your life. At that point you don't care about Bitcoin, you've just won life. Go do what you want. Don't just hodl bitcoin, put 10m into bitcoin advocacy. Spending that Fiat makes you, if you want, a tech-savvy public figure, an Elon Musk of sorts if you want to be. Why hodl that away?

Neat article! A few thoughts:


I like this perspective, it's a very rational one that most people don't promote here. It also sets up (in my opinion) an implied point that Bitcoin's value is directly tied to the variety of purchases you can make with Bitcoin, which makes sense. If the pebbles outside my house could suddenly purchase me anything my credit card can, I would be happy to purchase more pebbles from people at a high price.


eeeeehhhhhhh that's a huge stretch, especially considering that Bitcoin has spent 0 years at full-adoption or feature parity with Fiat.


The US really loves its ability to print its own currency. Frankly, this practice is useful in periods of economic recession to keep things from getting too out of hand. Decry it all you want, but the USD will never drop 50% in a month (or six) because the US controls the money flow. How do you guys think we can get past this roadblock? This is a huge stopper from bitcoin becoming any kind of international standard.

Wealth Distribution 2012 (wiki): Top 0.6% (42 million people) holds 40% of the money 
Bitcoin Wealth Distribution (Dec 2017): Top 1000 people hold 40% of the bitcoin. 
(Personal math: If 80% of bitcoin have been mined already, and every bit of the remaining 20% go to non-whales, that still means whales control 32% of the bitcoin supply at the end of the day) 
I'm a cautious HODLer, but can someone explain to me why this isn't really bad? Because on paper, this makes bitcoin look more lopsided than the fiat currencies it seeks to destroy. I don't want my mass-adopted currency to be at the whim of 1,000 people.

Banyan Hill is the same financial firm that appears on my "Featured Content" sidebar on websites saying "Economist predicts SEVENTY PERCENT CRASH IN STOCK MARKET IN TWO WEEKS..."
It's clickbaity stuff. They put themselves in a great spot because as long as the economy isn't crashing, they're allowed to stick with their guns because of the "difficult nature of crashes" or the "complicated stages that make this hard to view". They'll never be wrong, because they'll always be able to say "ah, but we're just in phase XXX of the pre-crash!". 
And then the moment there's a crash, one they've been incorrectly calling for for years and have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars erroneously betting on, they get to act all smug like they somehow saw this coming \*this\* time around. A broken clock is correct twice a day, this is low-quality fear-mongering.

Indeed they do. However, there's going to need to be some means of closing the wealth gap in order for a 5.5% interest rate to be plausible. Millennials can't buy homes as it is, jacking up interest rates that high again could prove even more problematic. 
I think a target rate of 3.5% is prudent right now given that we're in the infant years of a long tech&amp;space revolution. Strangling the ability for new businesses to enter the space is only going to lead to Apple/Google/Microsoft/Amazon gobbling up more and more market share.

You say you are more logic-brained, but then make very black-and-white statements. It is not logical to say that Bernie is "one of the all-time stupidest", or that "everyone knows his plans would be disastrous". Logically, I can prove you wrong by showing you 10,000 Toddlers who don't know literally anything about the economy, and I can point r/LateStageCapitalism to show you a ton of people who DON'T think his plans are disastrous. I think you could definitely tone those down to be a little less "if you disagree with me you're definitely wrong" sounding.
My favorite tip for improving my persuasion technique is to keep in mind "everyone is logical and rational in their own mind, you just need to figure out how they justify it". It's really, really hard to do, especially with people that believe the opposite of you. Take the bitcoin community. Why might they rally behind Bernie? What makes that rational in their mind, despite what his nay-sayers put out there? You can cheat and just say "Well duh they're stupid", but 1) that probably isn't true and 2) that won't win you any arguments.

Outstanding! Thanks for clearing that up, do you have any reading material I can reference for the new rise in subprime lending?
As for the Debt:GDP, this is certainly an interesting metric, although I think it's far more indicative that we are simply at the end of a gigantic, QE-fueled bull run. I am in the process of shifting my investments for a downturn in the next 12-18 months, I'm extremely confident like you that this will not go on forever. 
Where I think we differ is that I see this Debt increase as necessary for the new industrial revolution and not a precarious cliff in which any shock is going to result in global meltdown (this thesis will be tested if the Trade War with China continues).
This metric doesn't really say anything about emerging markets (the number of people with access to internet has doubled from ~1.5 to ~3 billion, over the past decade). More people are able to start businesses thanks to global connectivity, and those businesses are going to need debt in order to get their feet off the ground. That doesn't mean it'll end well for them, but I think an all-time Debt:GDP is not as bad as you claim it is, but rather it is simply a sign we'll start a recession soon.

Easy enough until you're staring down 1 million+ people who are now out of a job, there's far less infrastructure for lending which means growth is inhibited (esp in the small business area), and now you're forcing millions of Americans to find new banking solutions. That sort of shift isn't easy even if you're sticking to fiat, centralized banking. Do you think these trade-offs are worse than the results of QE? I personally think QE is better than the alternative, but I'd be very interested to hear why you think otherwise.

I'm extremely interested to hear what you think the trigger for the big collapse is going to be.

I'm a little cynical in that the 1st world crypto users had no issue bowing down to the big banks to give them crypto ETFs, which in my opinion will never allow mass adoption and cripples any attempt at de-centralization.

Okay, I'm going to make a prediction here that you're in high school or have a degree in something entirely unrelated to economics. I'm going to go through your post history and see if I can discern. Will update.
EDIT: Yeah guys all this account does is troll in the daily thread. Boy doesn't know a lick of economics
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:35:51
Interesting, I disagree! Let's return to your analogy. You've got the real gold owner, the fake gold owner, and the consumer, yeah? And real gold owner is angry that fake gold owner is selling his fake gold as real gold, yes? I want to make sure I didn't misinterpret your metaphor before I continue.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:43:59
Oh come on, don't stifle a good conversation, neither of us have anything better to do!
What I'm arguing is that if fool's gold performs every action that regular gold can, then the outrage from the owner of the real gold is entirely emotional, because they just got out-maneuvered in the business world. Now, that's just a shitty metaphor. In practice, it seems you're far more educated on the BTC-BHC controversy, so I'll need to pick your brain a little bit: is there any real difference between BTC and BHC? I know I'm walking into a bias trap here given your username, but shit, you're the first person I've ever asked - what does BTC do that BHC can't? I need education here man, don't leave a brother hanging!
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:16:59
IMO it would very much be an emotional statement. If this fool's gold is indeed fool's gold, then it will be found out as such and the market for it will adjust accordingly. **If nobody notices the difference,** then who cares if its fool's gold? The only person losing here is the owner of the real gold. I'm way too out of the loop of the BTC/BCH bullshit tho, do you see any flaws with my above logic?
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:25:27
Sure, my apologies if I wrote something confusing.
My current thesis is that bitcoin is losing value because of the recent BTC/BCH fork. I glanced on this sub when the drop below 6k happened and the comments seemed to corroborate that view - is that correct? I don't want to continue until we're on the same page and I'm not holding any misguided views.

Yeah, I didn't expect a real rebuttal. Have fun, hope you guys make bitcoin what Satoshi hoped it would be!
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:44:47
Counter-argument: people say don’t time the market. Well, if you got out of bitcoin at 10k and bought in at 5k, you doubled your bitcoin holding. If you believe 4K isn’t the floor, what’s wrong with timing the market? It’s all a matter of risk aversion. If I like the risky business, and I do as I described above, I have twice as many bitcoin as a normal HODLer. Of course hindsight is 20/20, but again, it’s all a matter of risk preference.
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:57:14
So when do I get my 20% off for using bitcoin? With visa I can now load deals onto my card and a simple system of servers and code can quickly determine if my purchase meets the requirement for a discount. If bitcoin gets this then I’ll switch, but until then I see very few advantages today for bitcoin over visa.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:23:21
I mean, I guess so. The point of having a bitcoin sub is so that you can have constructive discourse on bitcoin, yes? Don't you feel a little shafted that Reddit made this community for you guys and you have to put up with this drivel, especially when other communities have found rather simple solutions to the same problem? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:41:28
Great article in principal! I think it just went a little too edgy at points.


Maybe Medium isn't too fond of hosting people who make blanket declarations that the CIA, Mossad, and KGB are "jackboot thugs" working for the Illuminati World bank? Not only that, but you're on the side \*against\* them? I love how you touched on pseudo-anonymous topic, that's definitely the Bitcoin 201 class that most people gloss over.

Homie don't waste the response. I don't think the daily thread for a bitcoin subreddit is where you need to expend the effort. If bitcoin is indeed good, those voices will be silenced in due time. They only come back because redditors keep replying.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:12:19


The reason its selling off is precisely because this situation is looking less and less realistic with each fork.

So it seems pretty apparent reading the comments that the BCH controversy is a primary catalyst for this fall. What can bitcoin do to protect itself against forks having such an impact on price? I don't see a world in which one day every single person drops their altcoin to band together and make bitcoin the only crypto worth having. It doesn't seem plausible in my mind, nor does it seem like it's whats best for the crypto industry (competition encourages innovation &amp; monopolies = bad). 
So what's the long-term plan? How do we make sure that 5 years down the line when some schmuck starts shilling "Bitcoyne" it doesn't hurt bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:14:32
The disillusionment comes from three areas:
1) Bitcoin community seems to be equal parts "Let adoption come through slow trickles" and equal parts "Literally just let Goldman Sachs do it all for us and cross our fingers that they somehow become the progressive, perfect company we hope they can be for Bitcoin". Way too dangerous imo to let a US bank handle mass adoption for a currency literally trying to bring them down.
2) Bitcoin community has lots of vocal minorities that have no idea what the hell they're talking about. As it is with companies and other organizations, the leaders who took Bitcoin from whitepaper to today might not be the best ones to take us from today to mass adoption. Being a baller engineer doesn't make you a baller economist, even if bitcoin made you rich and you've been working on it since Day 1. If you keep shilling the "BUT MUH US DOLLAR INFLATION OVER 100 YEARS" meme, you're going to stop getting respect. Making lots of black and white statements without acknowledging the incredible nuances of the global economy, and then blindly turning away anyone who stands to disagree with you only works if you're the current President of the United States. 
3) Securing your bitcoins is still 100x harder than securing my cash. And yeah, it's easy to make statements like "oh hurr durr your bank could steal your money at any time". Guess what? I haven't met a SINGLE person in my ENTIRE LIFE who had a bank steal their money in the US. Yet for every one person who posts a downside to banks on here, I feel like I see two posts about someone losing all their bitcoin in a hack. What makes this even worse is that the person whose bank fucked them over gets all this sincere apology and camaraderie, but the person who lost their bitcoin is ridiculed. How can we promote mass adoption if you have to be watching your back all the time to make sure you don't slip up and lose your btc? There's some mysterious future add-on to Bitcoin that will solve this - I have no idea what it is, but without a solution to this problem, mass adoption will never happen imo.
What I do like going for Bitcoin, though:
1) It's getting the fuck outta the limelight. Volatility has gone way down, which was something I was originally concerned about for BTC being a future currency.
2) Square, one of my favorite startups of late, seems to be really bullish on Bitcoin and promoting it via the Cash app. Not to disparage the people putting in blood sweat and tears, but it's much more relaxing to see a 30-billion dollar company promote bitcoin than it is to read shill articles on this sub. 
3) Bitcoin has been around for ages, but has only been in the public limelight for a year or two. It's bound to attract far more talent today than it did five years ago, which should result in a parabolic curve of new innovations, adoption, and utility. If I start to see signs of this, I think I'll start to feel better.

Pulling the WSB card here, show positions or get your little bullshit post outta here. I’m bearish on BTC and share many of the same gripes as you but this isn’t the big dick post you think it is until you prove you profited off of it. Until then you’re just some lazy voyeur who calls predictions from his armchair with no skin in the game.

It's a great move for bitcoin, but Starbucks probably won't see any non-trivial benefit for a while. The vast majority of their 8 million cups sold per day are coming from people who don't care about bitcoin. Jessica, Katie, and Sasha just have to put their iPhone up to a scanner and they're good to go, no bitcoin required. I'm interested to see if Starbucks promotes this heavily or is just trying to open up yet another payment type.

RE the gold comment I think OP just meant that physical things almost always have some inherent value, where at the end of the day your digital things are only as valuable as the service they are a part of. If blockchain somehow goes down, bitcoin is useless, if the NASDAQ goes down, my stock is useless, but even if all of society goes down, I can still beat a mf over the head with my bar of gold or dam a river or anything you feel like doing with solid matter. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:46:44
This isn't really a bitcoin-specific answer but rather a more generic one, **since I'm not very educated on the more nuanced parts of the blockchain** \- storage &amp; data structures are always a trade-off. If you condense every single timestamp, in order for that timestamp to become operationally useful within the code you have to re-calculate the timestamp from the string. You gain storage space, but lose out on runtime. Facebook/Google/Amazon are usually content to store their timestamps in their native data structure format for this reason.
In a world where you can grab a 1TB hard drive for $50, but crypto transactions still lag CC transactions by a non-trivial margin, speed seems more important to me than storage, and adding runtime complexity to your data structures might not be the best way to go about it.
