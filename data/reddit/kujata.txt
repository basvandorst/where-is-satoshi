pretty sure people were saying this when it hit 200
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:00:53
samesies, when it was at $200, made $15 bucks!
I got .1 at $300 one week after that just to see where it would go.
I hope it dips back down but I can see it hitting $400 before then as there are more and more of us currently buying into it

It's already setup, but they'd rather use their network for data interception and storage

Newsflash bud, bitcoin is an altcoin. It just happens to be the most well known or used 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:20:20
you sound like a smug asshole in your response, but hey, that's just like my opinion man
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:45:50
buy now, the small amount you buy may take just as big a leap

my dad thinks it's a big ponzi scheme and that NSA will shut it all down and fuck everyone over that uses it

Boo Yeah! Finally acquired more than 1.0 bitcoin this morning. Also invested in 25 litecoins
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:53:51
This is true, I have a feeling it will go up short term and drop back around $300 when the media dies down.
I first learned about this a year ago, and since it's still sort of in its infancy I want to invest now. 
It was just over $200 exactly 1 week ago when I bought the .1, crazy how quick it jumped

And what happens if Bitcoin turns out to be the Titanic? What if it's the Napster of crytpo coins?
A lot of alt coins are shit, yes, but a lot are gaining traction because their features may be seen as an improvement by some people. Myself included.
Get off your high horse.

where did you day trade? did you just do USD/BTC at an exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:11:05
my greed is short term, i really only want to acquire enough to pay off all my student loans, credit cards, and car payment. debt is really the only thing that bums me out

i clicked a link in there that was about how they predicted all sorts of stuff and how bad things will be in the future. fuck that site, load of scaremongering bullshit.

7 bitcoins is not a lot if you're one of those people that have 1500 bitcoins from when they were worthless. could have just as easily been one of those people instead of an insider
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:51:54
i wish they dropped the minimum purchase to under .1

someone's going to screenshot this and go "LMAO look at this idiot", 50 years from now

i just bought my first .1 bitcoins because of your post, i had been debating about it but finally took the plunge

I would just like to add that If you feel burned about an alt coin dropping in price after you bought some it might be wise to simply hold and wait for the price to come back up. 
A big reason in dumping them is to buy back in when the price has dropped significantly.
I know TRC got pumped from .00016 to .001 a couple days ago, sat at .0004 for a while, and now it's at .0015
It's up to you to buy/hold/sell but it's just what I've noticed

i wish i had the amount of money it takes to instantly buy 10 bitcoins

my point was for bitcoin to grow at the rate everyone wants it to it needs to be accepted at brick and mortar stores. Do you really want to wait 20 minutes for confirmations when you buy anything? Faster coins are needed to compliment bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:33:06
if my father heard about it there's some media attention attached to it, he doesn't know how it works but one little blurb could get the ball rolling for people to stumble into it like myself
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:43:15
fuck you too
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:05:09
whether you like it or not there will always be alt coins. bitcoin is pefect as a way of transferring money or doing purchase over the internet. It's not good for doing purchases at stores when you have to wait 10-20 minutes waiting for confirmations to get your sub from subway. it'll already be cold by the time you can eat it. A faster coin used for those purchases will be necessary as bitcoin continues to grow
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:51:25
Same thing, but I'm learning on a smaller scale. Working with .35 bitcoin. I panicked and got back in around .312. I turned it into 24 litecoin and hoping the btc/ltc ratio goes back up around .015. But that'll require some massive btc drops to hit
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:50:16
is this the seizure of the bitcoin from silk road?
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:02:06
i have a lot to learn
