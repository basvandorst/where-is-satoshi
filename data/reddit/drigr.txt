He's a self righteous ass hole. He believes that not only is he better than everyone else for it, but that it gives him the right to treat people like shit.

So I have a question for you then. Is it normal for the received funds to keep moving into more and more accounts, until they're tiny, or into extremely large wallets? 
I went back to his [donation link]( and followed the first "withdrawal" in it and found one path that ended at $0.66. Though what really intrigues me is that I followed another path off of that, that has a current balance of $30,000 and a total received of almost $40,000,000. There are other paths that go from the donation address to high number addresses, and I'm on my phone so I don't wanna try and follow to see if there is a common destination for them, but is all of that normal? 
I'm willing to post some of the addresses I found, if that's okay. I don't know how protective people are of them and only posted the donation address because he already made it public on reddit. 
Also, what are confirmations?

No. I really was just asking. Did you actually read my whole post? I asked because someone brought up how it looked like a scam. I clearly state I don't know jack about btc, so I wanted the sub that knows btc to tell me if it's as fishy as it looks, and accepted the answers that it wasn't. Things had actually been going pretty peaceful until he decided to follow me into this thread and start up a scene. In the 3 threads I've been involved in over this I'm not even sure I called it a scam and pretty much just stuck to the "he's still an ass hole" claim. 
And yeah, he pissed a bunch of people off. Rightfully so too with his holier than thou attitude and telling people "I'm better than you." How about YOU come back and read this thread knowing that before he showed up here, he was already being a giant ass hat telling everyone else how shitty they are and how much of a better person he is than everyone else.

It's one thing for him to defend himself (which he's done poorly of, he doesn't explain his action, just insults you and posts a screen shot), but it's another entirely to tell people that you're better than them over a few pizzas.

Are you dense?

This isn't my fucking thread moron. All I did was come here to ask a question about why funds were leaving your address going to multiple new addresses. Something you didn't even bother to provide a reason for, but another user did in your stead. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 21:44:29
 his attitude here for starters. 
As you read down you'll see he was quoted/linked to himself saying "I'm better than you" but I was since deleted.

I didn't say shit about it being "all donations" and you can keep waving your "$1000 charity event" around, it doesn't make me think you're not a piece of shit. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:13:37
Yeah, I've volunteered actual time to a couple non profits in the past. I just don't feel the need to flaunt it or get all holier than thou about it. I also didn't even think to ask for compensation 
@_date: 2014-08-14 10:46:32
It kind of is our business when you ask for donations for a charitable cause. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:57:44
No. He isn't better than me. He is a pathetic excuse for a person who has expendable income and feels that he can buy "I'm a good person" point with it. That's not how being charitable works. It's also a pretty shit job of charity work for someone who has elevated themselves as highly as he. He sending fucking pizzas to people. If he wants to be a good person, why not donate that $1000 to the food bank? Or spend free time at a non profit organization? Oh right, that doesn't allow him to increase his self righteous worth on the Internet. 
So fuck YOU sir

Person with a calculator here! 
As much as I hate to defend this shit bag, 20 orders equalling 1k is only $50 an order. 30 is $33 an order. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:46:19
That's why I came here to ask. I made sure to state that I don't know jack about btc and I wanted to know why he was doing this. 
It doesn't help his case that any time he is asked about it be turns into an overly defensive cunt.

Since this thread is already here, and I'm not privy to btc and how it works, I'll ask here. Over at SRD, someone [looked up the donation address]( and noticed there are multiple accounts of him shuffling the btc out of his address and into multiple others, that have no other transactions. I'm (and I'm sure quite a few of us in the SRD thread) are wondering if this is an indication of a scam, and I'm personally wondering why the mo ey is being moved at all, especially into separate, previously unused addresses.
