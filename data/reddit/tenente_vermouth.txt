I know. It would cost me more than there is in the account to go to the nearest branch and retrieve it / more time than it is worth to set up online banking over the phone.
0.1% is still keeping up with inflation better than 0%. And interest rates could go up and I would get a better deal, this won't happen in OP's example.

Agreed! Some of the responses in this thread are crazy to me.
I've had a 5er in a savings account for almost as long and I'm still collecting my massive .1% interest. Isn't the point to get rewarded by the bank for depositing your money there?

I believe there is a company called Prover working on this.

I think the watch looks ace. There's too much fear mongering around here regarding any indication you may have some crypto.
There are plenty of well known crypto enthusiasts travelling the world talking about Bitcoin who post their travel dates and locations. Same for others involved in the blockchain industry.
It's pretty obvious to tell in the non-blockchain world when someone has some money but they're not all getting robbed every week.
You can talk about crypto, have nice things and still keep yourself out of danger. Otherwise why don't we all just wear the exact same cheap things, never talk about anything that may give any indication of wealth or even the indication you may have wealth in the future - sounds like a fun world :/
