Well, Bitcoin is the face AND the base of crypto, the one that really started it all.
Every exchange out there trades with BTC as reference.
When you tell your uncle that you invest in cryptos he will say... "Ohhh yeah, so you buy Bitcoins!".
Bitcoin is way more popular than any alternative and thus, has more demand. Also it has a "small" Max supply of 21 million.
But sure, I won't argue that any altcoin could take BTC's place in the future. In fact, my crypto portfolio is less than 10% BTC and more than 90% other coins.

It's backed by speculation on how much the technology is worth basically.

Relax and hodl tight.

Keep trying to contact Coinbase.
I know someone who had a similar situation and got their BTCs back (on a different exchange tho).

Stop daytrading bitcoins/eth/litecoin.
Always hodl those.

I think the price will rise since it gives the incentive to actively use it and not just for saving money like gold.

If I'm not mistaken, any bitcoin user prior to BCH's fork gets an amount of BCH on his account.

Just a meme, it's actually "hold" with a typo.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:13:59
Is this a copy pasta or you wrote it?
It's actually pretty great advice.
Well, not checking it every 2 years. Or even once a week, but maybe just once a day will be much healthier for all the bunch of unstable kids with 10 exchange sites open at the same time with their eyes glued to the screens.

Thank you. Merry xmas to you!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:10
I'll eat a shoe if that happens.

You should try XAPO. Really fast transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:33:19
Haha, looks fun.
Personally, I don't think I can skip a day without looking into the trends with so much money on the line. But I like to just do it once a day in general, that's fine for me.

Bitcoin is not for such small transactions like this one.
If you want to do small txs use other cryptos.
Bitcoin is for bigger amounts or money storage.

More efficient ways to use bitcoin = more people involved.
More people involved = more bitcoin demand.
More bitcoin demand = higher bitcoin price.

Binance works great for me. Been using it for quite a while now.

0.001 bitcoin was your gift?
That's just like 17 usd :O

He probably made more than you out of crypto anyawy...

I meant this prediction on a bigger scale, not on 15 mins variations.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:50:08
I predict the price will stay between 7000 and 7500 for some time. It's just a prediction tho...

What a boring life you must have to browse the Bitcoin daily thread without having any money into crypto.
