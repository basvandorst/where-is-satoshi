I remember there used to be a guy named dave bitcoin who would help people brute force passwords that they forgotten.  Usually he needs to know some clues to the password to crack it though.
Here is the link to the guys website I think: 
Here is a thread where he helped somebody:

Thanks I finally figured it out using commands on there:  
    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools cython libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
    git clone 
    cd python-trezor
    sudo python setup.py install
(had to add sudo to last one.)

No, don't enter the seed.  I ran into same problem, thread here: 
Are you using linux?  You need this setup also: 
Also I'm not sure if trezor is working with windows version of electrum yet.
If using Ubuntu enter these commands: 
    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools cython libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
    git clone 
    cd python-trezor
    sudo python setup.py install

You may want to add the instructions to setup python trezor on the electrum intallation/download page.  Some people were getting confused and even putting their trezor seed into electrum because they didn't see the hardware wallet option on electrum 2.0.

I think you're confused.  This is not a zero sum game like poker.  We are basically creating more wealth, not stealing it from others.  Inflation is what steals wealth from others by devaluing the money.  
Libertarians want competition and free markets.  We want different currencies to compete against each other.  This is the most healthy thing and leads to more wealth for everyone.  Maybe an inflationary currency will be better, maybe a fixed currency is better.  The market will decide and determine what is best.
Statists want centralized control over money with central banks. This leads to a monopoly and the money creators creating all the wealth for them and their cronies, at the common man's expense.  If Bitcoin were to succeed it could create a redistribution of that wealth away from the statist monoply men and towards the common man.
Also you are probably confused on the definition of inflation/deflation.  The true definition of inflation is an increase in money supply, and deflation is a decrease in money supply.  People have gotten confused over the years and now they refer to prices as inflation or deflation.  This shows the common misunderstandings people have about how economics works.
Here is a video by peter schiff illustrating this point about what the real definition of inflation is:

Ohh, but I'm kind of stupid.  Is there an easy tutorial to follow?  Do I need the development version on this page or what?

Send the coins to an exchange first like btc-e, or bittrex.  Then send from there to coinbase.  Coinbase will just see that the funds came from an exchange and think you are a trader.

Agreed, they should definitely add it to their download/installation page.
