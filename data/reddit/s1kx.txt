It's actually a good thing, because bitcoin already has mechanisms built-in to it to make sure this doesn't happen again - exchanges have just been too lazy to implement it. That means while MtGox dies, the network strengthens. These are the exact things we need, so that in one month when the dust has settled on this issue, bitcoin shines brighter than ever before and the idiots commenting on reuters and CNN now will have to face the reality that they were wrong.
Bitcoin is more like a religion, backed by science, versus a stock market. Since there is more and more acceptance every day, the question everybody should be asking which currency is more convenient and safe? I pick Bitcoin, in every category. I don't care about how much paper money people want to give me for it. When Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption, traditional currencies will have lost their value (because there is no use for it anymore) and 1 BTC might trade for $100mln, because noone wants or needs USD anymore, so why compare the value of this currency by how well it stacks up to its older version?

The traditional banking system will find their limits pretty close to what is already out there, since the fundamentally competitive model between banks prevents cooperation and the development of useful networks. They need to turn everything into a product, and the tightest bottleneck will be right around where you can only use certain features, like a joint payment (like multisig) with people at your own bank.
It's a battle similar to the one between Android and iOS (open-source and open standards vs apple garden). If it turns out similar, we will soon be looking at a 50/50 market?
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:31:13
Awesome, thank you!
The fact that we have been missing a properly organized and up-to-date documentation like this just shows how early we are still in the process of Bitcoin getting mature in comparison to existing technologies and ecosystems (e.g. implementing payments for an online store with stripe vs doing the same with Bitcoin)

The banks can't magically reverse the money either. Most of the time, they have to cover the expenses. How is this financed? Either from the absurd fees that you are charged with every transaction or by inflationary means (read: by making everyone pay for your problem).

Mining is a competition, one that is one of the main drivers of fiat influx to bitcoin, since everyone that wants to mine, needs to buy/build the hardware for it, house it somewhere and pay the associated recurring fees (electricity etc). If mining became unprofitable for people doing it right now, they would probably stop mining and driving down the network hashrate. Bitcoin readjusts the difficulty ("retarget") following the network hashrate change, which would then make mining profitable again for a lot of people. This feedback loop iexplains for why mining will *always* be profitable for someone, assuming the miners either keep their BTC or sell (exchange) them for more money than they spent on their mining operation. This loop obviously goes both ways, as a price rise can -cause- a rise in network hashrate. What's clear though is that it's unlikely that a mining company would be able to reverse their hardware investment, thus we can count on them mining as long as it makes sense with electricity paid. If this mechanism proves to work out, you'll see the BTC price grow proportional to the network hashrate, but right now we are a little bit off-track, as speculators and weak hands distort the image.
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:06:28
Cool, I've been thinking about the same things but couldn't put it together that well! Good job.
Not only does this prevent double spending because you would have to cooperate with the instant confirmation provider (meaning both would have to risk all their reputation), but we could also be sure that the instant confirmation provider/wallet will detect and complain if we are in a &gt;50% attack scenario that [prevents the transaction from getting confirmations]( (which would then be mostly useless anyways, since double spends are prevented).
Now, for X.509 - should we rely on the existing hierarchy or would it make sense to have certificate issuing and revocation be managed by companies that could do domain-specific audits? I guess that would take away decentralization from bitcoin. So having each payment processor specify which CNs they trust is the preferred way, right?

API docs are live: 
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:49:23
We need an authorization system similar to debit/credit cards so that you could authorize a vendor to charge your coinbase/greenaddress/etc wallet without you signing the transaction each time. Think similar to OAuth, authorizing apps to access parts of your account transparently, like with Facebook apps.
This would probably be outside the realm of the bitcoin protocol, but maybe we should work on a specification for wallet providers. I can't imagine how a gas station for example would take bitcoin payments without entirely changing their system around otherwise. Probably similar to how you have to pay cash beforehand, but I'm not sure if that would make bitcoin look like an attractive alternative to anyone...
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:19:11
One thing I wonder is if the current price drop could be related to more selling pressure due to new speculators running low on fiat money i.e. for paying taxes with tax-day coming up april 15th (price going to increase after?). It seems that selling pressure has been so high for the last 2 months that it should be exhausted or running into exhaustion for hopeful speculators that jumped in on drops after the goxxing.

Basically a bitcoin tumbler that works more securely with bitcoins "contract" feature.
Sharedcoin implements CoinJoin, which is a technique to join transactions of multiple people together into one, so that it's a lot harder to determine which input was supposed to go to which output.
Look at  for an example of such a transaction.
Blockchains Sharedcoin offers this with 1-10 repetitions, which makes the 'tumbling' even safer.

Not necessarily related to OP:
We should have a service such as recaptcha offer an alternative to captchas by paying a small amount of money in Bitcoins (1000 satoshi or so) for signing up to websites. Spammers already have sophisticated software for solving captchas (which arguably can be better than the human eye), or often using a captcha solving service that uses a hybrid between optical character recognition and paying minimal salaries to people in third world countries for solving the captchas for their bots. In the OP we see a good example of this delegation practice. The only ones affected by this barrier are the real end-users that can't decipher the distorted text.
By having a method of just paying an adequate minimal fee for sensitive parts of a service (signing up, requesting password reset, messaging someone) that would be target of bad actors (spammers etc), we could get rid of this ugly artifact and improve the state of the internet.
Would there be an interest for such a thing? I'm a developer and would take the time to work on that if there is a real interest for it.

It often irks me to see people say stuff like "Do you really think the governments/banks are just gonna let Bitcoin ruin their business?" without seeing the irony in it.
So we realize our system is full of middlemen and gatekeepers which not only gamble with your money, they also tell you what you can and can't do with your money, and most likely end up screwing you over once they are in trouble.
Look at Cyprus - a country like any other where the Banks hold full control of your funds, and the government [robbed it's own citizens]( To be a little bit more visual: Had the same thing happened with the government trying to seize Bitcoins, they would have to kick down doors and get ahold of the password for every single wallet. ([Something similar]( has been attempted before).
We are so used to this concept of being financially monitored and restricted, I can't blame anyone for thinking it's a feature. After all, there's reasons for these regulations, but I think the reasons are wrong.  We'll never be able to use our financial system as a reliable means of preventing crime, because a criminal will be able to use any currency he wants to, even if it's collectors items or merely an internal ledger on a piece of paper. If bitcoin and altcoins have taught us anything, it's that "value" is just a convention.
I think the issue is kind of the same with the black market/drug economy etc. in that the way we regulate it doesn't prevent it from happening, these sectors just shift to other ways to achieve what they are doing, e.g. creation of shadow economies that naturally are harder to track, while attracting more crime and violence. Transacting with money or other things should never be illegal in itself or be reason for suspicion.
*Please, let's decouple the financial system from our legal system, and work on getting better at preventing and prosecuting crimes.*

Tips brings up an interesting point: most people I would assume tip on credit card billing, which invites problems such as fees, dishonest restaurant owners that cash in the tips themselves and I've even heard of stories of delivery guys changing the amount on the receipt. With Bitcoin tipping gets on par with cash tipping again (which a lot of businesses prefer anyways), the waiter/-ress can even collect it to their personal address. Woops, here comes another major sector getting ridiculous benefits through Bitcoin.

It would expand the network, and even accepting bitcoins with pegging builds the bridge to be able to "start refusing to accept dollars". More transaction volume is exactly what we need. Apart from that, Amazon's support would be a huge boost to Bitcoin's reputation.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:26:57
I agree. Most people holding btc on the exchanges believe news affect the price, so they sell, but I doubt anyone actually "quits" bitcoin, just everyone trying to make a profit by selling before others sell. But it's a guaranteed re-buy, therefore +-0 effect on the value. The following upswing surprises people in long positions (waiting for BTC to rise and show indications of growth before buying), since the grow is occurring in an episode that everyone assumes to be negative. I would say at the moment BTC are very undervalued, simply because I doubt that a lot of people would really sell a lot of bitcoin and then not buy back in with the same amount of money, while there is also a lot of "hidden" liquidity since traders hold fiat with the promise of buying in when bitcoin seems unlikely to fall in value.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:30:25
My guess would be they are building a competitor to Square that accepts Bitcoin payments (or at least opens an interface for adding cryptocurrencies on your own), possibly with NFC support. Since it's targeted for mainstream adoption, I would guess it optionally supports autoconversion to fiat money (but hopefully with a nice fee on top of it, to encourage keeping BTC). This would enable the average joe owner to accept this "trendy BTC thing" without understanding the complicated internals of it. The obstacle of setting up a wallet and understanding how to get customers to pay to it and how to get USD out of it is what is keeping Bitcoin short of being adapted by the majority share of stores that are interested so far.
And about colored coins: I doubt they would do a hard fork and not take advantage of Bitcoins $7B valuation already. There would not even  be much of an advantage, since isolating their currency would expose it to high volatility (miners and investors jumping on and off board depending on every single news article about their product)
By the way: Notice the similarity between "Circle" and "Square", even their logos...
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:26:14
Yes, but due to the sheer amount of transactions on blockchain all the time, it doesn't take very long to happen. But it can take a long time until every input of a repeated sharedcoin transaction is confirmed (took like 20 hours for me recently)

I think this actually makes a lot of sense.
Kleiman seems to have been part of the satoshi group, but I don't think he was actually responsible for creating any bitcoin code. Rather, there is at least one more person at play who has not yet been uncovered, but this person was responsible for actually implementing the ideas brought forth by Kleiman and Wright (possibly Shyaam Sundhar, but I am just guessing as they have worked together before and Sundhar fits the cryptographist profile).
I wouldn't directly dismiss the idea that Wright was part of the group, like so many people do, because he doesn't present the same expertise that Satoshi had. Maybe the "leaked" email in which Wright wrote to Kleiman that he is working on a Bitcoin/bit cash project is real. But I don't think that Wright had all the pieces together yet. It is much more likely that Kleiman etc were responsible for the idea of a distributed ledger (the block chain). Maybe Wright just operated machinery for initial mining.
The leaked Tulip trust contract states that if Kleiman dies, Wright may move shares at his own discretion 15 months later. This seems to coincide with the time that the investigation of Wright by the Australian tax office started (or at least got serious). That would make a lot of sense, seeing as the contract states that the return of the coins will be in the form of a company in the Seychelles...
The entire dilemma with Wright being so dodgy (and possibly leaking these documents himself) might just have to do with another NDA in place by Kleiman to Wright, or a mutual NDA between all members of the satoshi group.
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:01:14
IMO Gavin should just pull a reverse-wright, admitting he was hacked and the bogus NDA leaked
