I think you can do it with a pruned node. Only a few GB are needed

Yes, Electrum is a SPV wallet, no need to download the blockchain. You can however use your Bitcoin node to verify and load transaction data. Dont trust, verify

I prefer the flat fee with Samourai's Whirlpool

You can use a Bitcoin ATM

Install Bitcoin Core, go to the settings and activate pruned mode. I use Electrum Personal Server with a 10GB pruned Bitcoin node, it will probably work with btcpayserver too

Electrum is the wallet. EPS uses the Bitcoin Core client to validate and get transaction data, no need to trust third party servers anymore.

If you bet on the horse who recently won several games your return would be much much lower.

Value Added Tax (VAT) on everything except books and healthy foods and capital gains tax on profits north of 30k per year.

Using third parties introduces you to unnecessary risks. If you know how to properly secure your private keys you really shouldnt use a third party for accepting Bitcoin.

We know that cryptographic hash functions are really hard to brute force but there is no mathematical proof that it isnt possible to crack it.

+175% on the BTC ratio is not parabolic enough for you? You even had the chance to sell at the double top two months later. If it plays out like the last halving in 2015, LTC is gonna bleed for months with no ending in sight. And ETH is in a descending triangle.. If I were you I would sell your alt bags immediately for Bitcoin

Can we expect segwit integration in the near future?
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:16:17
Most Bitcoin ATMs offer reasonable prices because you pay for convenience and privacy. If I had an ATM near me I would totally prefer it over any other option with KYC

The law would have to be at a point where robots are granted rights as an individual, otherwise the ownerless car could be just getting stolen by someone and no one would give a shit.
Lets say robots have those rights.. there is no incentive in giving it its independence. The company that produces the robot wants to make profit so they will own it until a buyer is found and the buyer will want to use it to generate income. Giving up the ownership is nonsense

Cars can be autonomous but they will always have a owner.. but yes these types of taxis would offer the lowest possible prices and that is great. In the long run almost everything will be fully automated and efficient. Human labour wont be wasted in driving taxis anymore but will be directed into more valuable work
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:00:38
People could still buy a car and let it do the taxi work for them. Unless you change something in the system cars will always have an owner since someone has to buy and register it.
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:50:14
Well someone still owns the taxi and receives it's revenues..

Not your keys not your Bitcoin. Having BTC on an exchange comes with certain risks

There are only 6 million Bitcoin addresses with over $100 worth of BTC. I'd say we are VERY early.
