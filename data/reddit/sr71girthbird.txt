How on earth could you possibly come to that conclusion from what I said lol. I've made one trade of BTC ever. Bought at 5400 three months ago then sold 4 days later when it was at 17,800. I'm completely uninterested in buying BTC for any reason, ever again, regardless of price movements.

You can, it’s called KIN. But it will never go up in value because it’s a money grab.

Why do you think answering your own questions and using caps helps your argument? It's just annoying and makes your comment read incoherently.
It's not that I don't like BTC,  it did very well for me for the limited time I owned some. It used to have value in it's use case. It doesn't anymore. I just see the writing on the wall, and I think it's too bad many others don't.
If you were actually looking for a specific coin to store money in, DASH would be a prime candidate. BTC's value prop as a means of exchange is absolutely done for with small value transactions no longer being viable, and so the companies that originally allowed payment with BTC are dropping it. At the same time DASH is seeing rapid migration of those services in their direction. Multiple use cases = value that's not centralized around one key function.
Furthermore, DASH has a small supply which is ideal for a coin that will act as a store of value, and DASH doesn't have to worry about phantom market cap like BTC does, where no small percentage of the mined coins are lost forever, or inaccessible in some other way. Additionally, BTC is extremely top heavy with the top 1000 wallets by balance controlling over 40% of all coins in existence. DASH doesn't have that. No organization in their right mind would hold large sums of money in a currency controlled by so few parties *they don't even know.*
And PS: I did say a store of value is BTC's only use case, and even that's a hard argument to make as you've seen here. Even if they come up with more uses for BTC, there will have to be an incentive to move back to BTC from whatever other coin is doing that, and that incentive doesn't exist.

Lol this is the type of shit I love. Just idiots spewing nonsense because they're losing money. A store of value was never meant to be BTC's use case, it's just the only thing left that people have come up with since other coins do everything else better now (speed of transaction, transaction cost, anonymity, you name it). BTC is on it's way out whether people like it or not. Only sucks for the people who cling to it too long.

Every business that stopped using it cited price fluctuations as the main reason though.
