That situation isn't different from what we have today. 
You could be "pressured" into voting a specific way, because it favors you heavily. 
(This is an example, and I don't care about either position, so don't talk about that, just the point of the example.)
Say you are on minimum wage. Then you are incentive to vote for someone who is going to increase the minimum wage, because you can't afford NOT to vote that way. 
It's a situation that excises today, and will too if this new method of voting is implemented. No change here, so don't bring this up, because this form of voting is not meant to fix that problem. Additional policies should fix it, not the way of voting.

I agree, but many people would be upset if their figurative power was limited. 
I think it would be easier to accept, if the more capable would get more votes. You get the same results, just through a more "friendly" way, and people get less upset than taking their voting away.

Some situation we have now. The rich can "buy" votes. This just makes sure, that if you don't wanna be bought, they can't.

This is a very and idea. If you thought, that the candidate with the most money won before, now it will be even more so.
