Darkwallet. I've just been playing around with different clients with small - smallish amounts of btc.

How can I double spend it?

Yep, you got me :P

Strange turn of events. The bitcoin transaction has disappeared (Blockchain message "Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: Transaction was previously accepted but has been pruned from our database.") and the funds returned to the original wallet. For the sake of learning more about BTC, can anyone explain what has occurred here?

Thanks, I'll give that a try.

Well if there is a miner reading this.... please? :P

Appreciate the reply. 
Is there anything I can do to push the transaction or is it just a waiting game until a miner decides to take mercy?

While I really do appreciate the help, and all in all I'm not really fussed about the BTC, it wasn't much. But I am somewhat perplexed that the transaction is clearly on the block-chain so there is no doubting that the client did it's job to some extent. Surely there should be a fail-safe in place for such things.

Appreciate it. Dark wallet certainly isn't my main wallet client. Myself and a friend have just been moving a small amount of BTC between wallets as an experiment, thought DarkWallet seemed neat so I installed it. I won't be putting any substantial amount of BTC in it.
