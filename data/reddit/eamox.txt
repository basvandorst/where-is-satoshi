In the 1950s it was the pound sterling, in the 1960s it was the deutschmark, in the 1970s-80s it was the yen, in the 1990s it was the euro, and in the 2000s it was the renminbi. Now in the 2010s its Bitcoin. The path has always been clear.

This is from a 2009 memo that has nothing to do with crypto. People have been estimating the demise of the dollar since the 1950s, it's nothing new.

This is pretty much a literature review with a very lackluster conclusion. Ten years after the invention of Bitcoin and this basic bullshit is the best the IMF can do? Yikes.

Great overlay and OC, this will definitely be a trend to follow especially considering the Bank of China's recent bullish report on Bitcoin (source: [ 
This could be evidence of the BoC moving into the crypto space by making large purchases of BTC, perhaps in anticipation of another global economic recession. Big news if one of the world's largest central banks is treating BTC as a reserve currency.

Interesting. This makes sense as well considering the invention of fiat would significantly lessen the demand for silver. What I'm saying though is that this comparison is not as useful as it seems, since we are comparing two very different monetary systems that are not isolated from one another. Silver is less valuable today precisely because of the shift made from commodity to fiat money, while at the same time, fiat also loses its value because of our persistent dilution of the money supply (not exactly possible under a gold or silver standard), which increases the velocity of money but does not necessarily grow the economy.

Nobody is saying it lost value wrt everything though, this tweet specifically implicates silver as if the pound is still tethered to it. Fiat is inflationary by design, but when the pound was created it was not fiat money and nobody was using chartal theories of money. Gold and silver standards regard commodity theories of money. As I said, it is clearly anachronistic.

If the pound is measured in terms of the price of silver, and the price of silver skyrockets, does that really mean the pound is less valuable? Silver becoming more valuable doesn't make the pound less valuable. Inflating the money supply to cover the government's deficit spending is what devalues it. This comparison is anachronistic and relies on the assumption that a gold or silver standard has been maintained since 1702, which it obviously has not. Same goes for gold and the U.S. dollar. This is a pithy tweet but really just shows how bad we are at economics.

This guy is on an island somewhere with Tupac, Biggie, and JFK. RIP you legend.
