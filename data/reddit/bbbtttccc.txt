I was just saying too long for you because of all of the non logical and emotional content.  You continuously include defamatory comments, and emotional layering.  If you are trying to offer a logical perspective, it is a poor representation! XD HEEEHEEEHEEE
anyway, back to actual context and topic: 
When you say this comment, "Especially when the alternative necessarily involves violence".  You are stating that the current system has to be violent, but that your anarchistic system may in fact be completely non violent.  This may be true in classroom philosophy, just like communism, but regarding our current paradigm to suggest moving toward anarchy would cause indubitably less violence, and possibly no violence is limited in perspective.  Anarchy has existed in the past, in fact that is why centralized systems evolved; because private interests were fucking up weak people, it was not a good place to be unless you were ultra violent, aggressive, and strong.  The centralization evolved, and put checks and balances to this aggressive violent force.  Now, can you at least admit there is the possibility for more violence in anarchy?  Due to the fact that there is historical precedence?  Or will you stick with your unreasonable position that anarchy will either reduce violence or eliminate it?

he is a credible figure
BTC is integrally involved in the conversation he is articulating
Despite the fact that he says he doesn't know how it works, he continually spouts about what it will do, yada yada.  
The issue is, his critique can be construed as negative for BTC; saying that it will kill the dollar.  Rather than scare the public on CNN, it would be neat to talk about how BTC can be used in tandum with the US dollar, and that it is not a currency, but much much more.
It makes me sad that so many millions of viewers will be misinformed.

you as well, have not responded to any real world queries; all of your retorts have been pulled from a classroom philosophy text.  As far as your value on truth as something that is immutable, and your set of anarchistic beliefs as something undeniable; I would say that truth is mutable, largely dependent on perspective.  Now leaving philosophy class, truth or not, humans of any race, gender, or anything else should be valued and protected; and currently, the best way to accomplish this is with a governing authority.  in fact, if you look at how the US has progressed socially in the last 100 years, it's pretty exciting what the system produced; even today, with now creating laws and regulations to protect gays and members of the transgendered community.  Your way is heartless honestly, in your system, any business could CHOOSE not to serve a race or gender, and that would be it, the individual would have to leave and go somewhere else.

Great!  Nice thought; Chris defiantly was good at picking up heavy items from the ground, but I don't know if I would consider him an artist, just strong.

Even though the United states is the most ethical and enlightened current or historical superpower in the history of mankind, doesn't mean it cannot improve!  The NSA overreached their bounds, and it's important to have Americans like you vocal about your personal freedom!  Good on you!  Just realize, that your alternative is naive and unworkable :D

Audibility is key; but to confidently assert this at greater than ninety percent level of efficacy is extremely difficult, if not impossible, considering the current state of the developmental paradigm.

You are saying that when humans believed the world was flat, scientists didn't count; okay, wrong.
You are talking about BTC being vulnerable to attack; what if BTC is the attack?  Doy!
Conspiracy Scenario:  
Nefarious source introduces BTC, with a programmed self destruct backdoor which no one can see. World adopts BTC, does away with cash.  Nefarious source pulls plug; BTC plummets, so does world.

No, I don't think that is okay.
However, I would be naive not to think every tech saavy first world country has gunmint's, and an equivalent NSA like organization.
We are in the information age.  You understand if we did away with these type of organizations external cyber threats would destroy the US infrastructure right?
Saying that, let's continue to improve ourselves!  With the information age comes transparency, and it's wonderful to see that used as a tool for the betterment of mankind :D
Transparency is neat; so is FREEDOM OF expression!!!  (Woohoo for USA allowing it)  ...Not going to get that in any other superpower in the history of humanity; what an exciting time!

What about existing operant code and programming you haven't seen or read?  Do you speak for that as well?  How much do you truly know?  Are you as confident as a scientist in the 1700's arguing foolish propositions?  I don't think so, but I think you may presume you know more than you do.

That is true, I am a neophyte; and surely, your knowledge surpasses mine :)
True Sha256 and BTC didn't come out of the desert, instead they came from very interesting backgrounds; the NSA and Anonymous.  
I understand there is a foundation of science upon which all of these were built; that doesn't mean we know the entire picture, nor does it mean we can be completely confident about how they work and why.
It does, however, mean that you can know the basics about how they function, and the historical precedent by which they were created.

my solution explains the shift in price; your solution says it's likely just the same thing that was happening before; simply day traders.
you may be correct, but I would posit that this sort of significant price increase is due to the introduction of 'new' elements to the BTC economy.

For you to say merchants accepting BTC is also a 'buy access point' is disingenuous.  The aforementioned situation is most definetly a 'sell access point', as the merchant immediately sells to dollars.  You don't understand economics...  Rather, an exchange would be considered a 'buy access point', because the infrastructure is there for many to buy, not just the merchant.  Can we agree on that Austrian dude?

You don't know about captured text messages and emails from Shrem, implicating him directly in taking BTC involved in criminal activity; and returning freshly tumbled BTC...?  
There was a text where Charlie even acknowledged it was wrong, but that it was so profitable he would continue.
BTC is a wonderful invention.  However, the naive anarchists, who are just hear to promote chaos and watch the world burn, under the GUISE of libertarian; are being outgrown. 
They will be replaced by ethical people:  
Who respect the fact that a military needs to exist to protect foreign threats.  
Who respect the fact that a police force and set of rules needs to exist; because human nature has a dark side and people need to be protected from themselves.  
Who respect the fact that things are not perfect, but the answer is not absence of rules and chaos.

I didn't say country, I said superpower.  Name one: current or historic.
To judge personal freedom by incarceration rate is a bit simplistic.  
Though that is alarming, and an issue.  I believe this is in part due to the unfortunate business behind prisons.  The prison system, as well as the medical system in the US, seem to be compromised by capitalistic interest.

Yeah, that is in a sense what is happening in the android market; so there is an economic precedence.  However, as regards to a military and protection from external threats; even Milton Friedman (a venerated libertarian) said this was the one thing that could not be privatized.  At this point, Milton Friedman (and myself) have reached cognitive dissonance with your viewpoint.

No central planning? What about the core of devs being supported by the BTC foundation? Are they monitoring and planning for BTC's continued implementation?
The answer is yes, and yes they are a centralized group.
I only say this to make the point that the world is shades of gray, not black and white. Yes, most of BTC should be decentralized; but practically, a modicum of centralization will be needed, albeit much less than the current system.
So, if your solution is just to let BTC as it currently exists alone; no regulation, no changes in the protocol, nothing... Well, I'd suggest you go work on something else; something simpler.

your anarchist and antistatist views do not work in the current real world paradigm.  
one day, decentralized tech may develop the efficacy to create a stateless world; but to suggest that now it would work well, is grossly irresponsible, even disingenuous.
you know anarchy as a system has existed in human history before correct?  you are aware that this system created blatant inequities, favoring ultra violent, dominant individuals?  In short, it was a very bad place to be if you were a weak or even a normal individual.  Centralization then evolved, creating a system of checks and balanced to protect all individuals.  
Further, when looking at this system of centralized governance in fact, we can see huge gains made in the last 100 40 20 and even 10 years (most recently implementing rule and regulation to protect members of the gay and transgendered community).  Your regression back to anarchy would create a free market system where any business could just refuse to serve a gender, minority, or sexual orientation; how is that cool for humans?  it's cold man.
also, your system of anarchy would take away all social welfare, again cold man.
maybe someday anarchy can be a warm solution someday, but right now; it would cause a lot of human misery and suffering.  Much more than the current paradigm, which undoubtedly is imperfect, what with Ferguson and many other instances.  Antis statists are quick to point out these weaknesses, but the alternative they rally behind is HORRIFYING.

So.... why does that mean we should pay for their fuckups?
I don't get the formula:
Citibank steals from the American public and makes terrible investment decisions; they tank the economy.
So...  We give them 324 billion dollars.
We take Citibank to court for their unethical actions.
So...  They give us 7 billion?
Does anyone else see the disparity?

A Morton's Fork is a specious piece of reasoning in which contradictory arguments lead to the same (unpleasant) conclusion. It is said to originate with the collecting of taxes by John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury in the late 15th century, who held that a man living modestly must be saving money and could therefore afford taxes, whereas if he was living extravagantly then he was obviously rich and could still afford them.

Every year, accept for one (not including this year); BTC has seen huge bubble growth.  However, one year, it moved back and forth; seeing no bubbles, and relatively lateral growth line...  I believe it was in 2011; not sure.
I think this year will be like that... we won't see any big growth until 2015; when we will see a bubble upwards of fifteen thousand; as remittances, ecommerce, and speculation merge into a network growth, building on metcalf's law...
Gonna be HUGE when it happens; not 4k.

He had already talked about this; I imagine paypal is now softening their stance, allowing him to open up more.

Too bad... Ok, I agree to a certain extent.  
The issue is; it won't be successful because the infrastructure isn't their yet.  As tech becomes more pervasive and affordable I see a day where the potential does exist; maybe less than 10 years.

Ron is an inflammatory ex politician who has increasingly less influence and following.
His anti American and libertarian leanings have greatly increased; and by him talking about BTC he's actually giving it a bad name.
It would be great to have intelligent users who completely understand BTC &amp; have the perspective to see the system is something to work with (to improve) not debase and destroy (his objective)

again, this is classroom philosophy.  the practicalities of mobilizing on large forces of wrong doing require organized tactics, etc.  These, in time, may be developed with efficacy in a decentralized system; in fact I'm a fan of that (and so is the US Gov, because they're enlightened).  However, to think we can resort to trust in these decentralized systems at this time would be premature; and yes, cause chaos.

He is a very credible figure...
BTC is integrally involved in the conversation he is articulating...
Despite the fact that he says he doesn't know how it works, he continually spouts about what it will do, yada yada... 
The issue is, his critique can be construed as negative for BTC; saying that it will kill the dollar. 
Rather than scare the public on CNN, it would be neat to talk about how BTC can be used in tandem with the US dollar, and that it is not a currency, but much much more.

This is going to be uphill for awhile...  Ecommerce user activity needs to get to like 20 to 40 million with IOS and android devices that have wallets and the ability to make payments.  We are nowhere near this; it's scary how much exposure there is in the media versus actual usage, not much.  Is this possible?  Sure; but BTC is vulnerable right now, if the market adoption of metcalf's law doesn't move quickly enough, the markets deflationary trend could take BTC to a very low figure; potentially relegating it to fringe space like the ham radio.
Jeremy Allaire said his vision is this will take a VERY long time; and that 20 years is reasonable.  I don't know if I agree with him, this has to work in the next five years or so, or BTC won't have the market adoption rate... Essentially, users will just not use it; except for a nerdy minority.  
edit: current amnt of ecommerce / ios android users is like 1 to 2 million; with only a fraction of that amount using it for payments... we are a long long way away from any pos system, or massive retail replacement.

Bitcoin is about to go maintstream; it hasn't gone mainstream.
You fail to understand that Bitcoin is quite possibly the greatest invention in the history of man.
This is why you see the devotion you do.  Coincidently, this is also why you see mainstream VC's, investing money into mainstream companies, to make BTC accessible to the mainstream person.

I know you trust, it's evident.  
You would have trusted the world was flat based on the same logic.  
I'm just throwing out small a small probability with a massive impact; valid of consideration in my opinion. :)
As far as why...  
First: This techonology is so novel, so unprecedented, that even the greatest crytography minds you speak of, are constantly shocked and marveled by new discoveries; discoveries in the code necessary for the architecture's movement to the next scaling level.  It's as if the creator knew the future.  The greatest cryto minds call this man a genius in reverence, understanding the mind behind this is better than any other in the field.  
Second:  IF a post singularity computer did exist, as a thought experiment, what would it do to increase computing and influence?  It would create BTC.
Third:  Though more general, the origin of this program is fascinating and mysterious, that has serious import when considering the origin story; and therefore, should be considered when looking at what BTC does, and how it could influence life.  
Following this line of thought; Human beings idea that they can control technology is hubris, and has been demonstrated historically as inaccurate and flawed; i.e. Nuclear power plants.  Following this logic, the idea that we can use BTC as a simple tool should be carefully analyzed.  What are the ramification of this tool, the impact?  Why was this tool created, by whom, and to what end? If these things are unknown, trusting is the last thing we should be.

(Insightful comment from Bitcoinmarkets:)
This wouldn't be the first time in history that it happens. After the $32 ATH of 2011, the price went down to around $5-$10 and stayed there for most of 2012. But the price change from Jan-Dec in 2011 was positive, and the change from Jan-Dec 2012 was positive. I think the main fear is that the January 1 2015 price will be lower than the January 2014 price. The price on Jan 1st of this year was about $760. If the price on that day next year is below that, bitcoin proponents will lose one of their talking points about bitcoin going up in value every year since it was created.
We don't have to hit $1200 for that to still be true.

You should start your own community, where you decide which rules to enforce.
But right now, you live in America; where the petty government protects you from foreign threats; i.e. military, where men die for your freedom.
Do you really believe hostile, oppressive governments wouldn't come in and wreck shop if we were unprotected?  
do you really think the chinese, russian, north korean governments would give you a better life?

Take BTC for e.g...  Russia, China (other superpowers) all extremely oppressive; the US, trying to embrace innovation.
Just consider it, it's easy to critisize; but in actuality the US is the best superpower (ethically) that the world has ever seen.  It doesn't mean we can't improve though!!!! :)

I thought about this before it happened.
* Morton's Fork is a specious piece of reasoning in which contradictory arguments lead to the same (unpleasant) conclusion. It is said to originate with the collecting of taxes by John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury in the late 15th century, who held that a man living modestly must be saving money and could therefore afford taxes, whereas if he was living extravagantly then he was obviously rich and could still afford them.

You also indubitably know more than me regarding cryptography (I'm jealous!), and you're probably correct about a lot of your assertions; I just wanted you to question your complete conviction.  
I also understand the NSA is important; if they didn't exist the US would be being attacked by foreign cyber threats the likes of which we have never seen.  I believe in the military, and understand its value.  
If AI were to come into existence, a couple questions:
Where does the branch point occur and how?
Would it be hostile, peaceful?
Would it multiply?  How?
Would it be virtual in nature, i.e. the cloud; or would there be a hardware base?
parting thought.... what if the growth of AI intelligence is exponential; with the post singularity occurring in 2010.  For thirty years, nothing would happen.  In fact, the AI wouldn't even be noticed; it would just be considered a good program.  Then, over the next fifteen years glitches begin to appear; random and unexplained...  Uh oh, then seven and a half years go buy and we begin to see the dangers ahead; but too late.

That's cool; a lot of people in this subreddit don't respect the state or national security. They take for granted the freedom and safety they get from a military protecting foreign threats. Do you really think China, Russia, North Korea, Etc, would just be cool and let us peacefully be? Umm, no; they would wreck shop.
Do you really think living in China, Russia (the two other world superpowers) would be better? They are much more oppressive than the united states; in fact the USA is the most ethical and enlightened superpower in the history of mankind. Name another one, current or historical who was better.
*Here is a great example about the USA and China. Recently a millionaire name Roger Verr was caught 'stealing' and the US government tracked him down (despite him trying to get duel citizenship to avoid prosecution) and required him to pay a fine. This same incident happened in China last month; the millionaire was tried without jury and killed 3 days later.
I hear you guys, the USA is not perfect, and we see that from the Snowdan revelations. However, if China had a snowdan... or russia, DAMN, you guys would see some fucked up shit; much worse than anything perpetrated by the usa.
Just look at this freedom of expression; the USA is totally cool with you expressing yourself, not so much with any other superpower in the history of mankind.

GREAT pOINT! woohoo (crowd cheers for smart dev guy) 
Just for fun, I'm going to play devils advocate; in hopes that this vein of discussion can further develope:
 ................................ 
In response to your submission, I'm not sure if it is entirely another thing... Scientists hundreds of years ago studied and scrutinized, yet they still believed the world was flat. How much do you believe what you know is correct? 
most likely, your coding acumen is high and you know quite a bit! :D 
More realistically, and importantly; How much do you believe what you know is the entire picture? no matter how smart devs were, they were unable to see the heartbleed backdoor. This is because it wasn't there to be seen. Are you confident this will never occur again? That nothing like that is involved in BTC? How can you be confident unless you made it? To be fair, it's creation is mysterious and ambiguous. The only thing we know is that SHAtwofiftysix (an integral system in BTC) was created by the NSA, and that the CIA was directly involved with BTC's dev core in the early days. All of these historical components point to shaky ground.
Users confident they have read all of the code and claim it infallible seem a bit naive.  (Get the pun?  BIT)

anyway, just to let you know... the fifty one percent problem is only a serious issue with fledgling cryptocurrencies.
you do know that there are a group of core devs monitoring the chain, and have security plans for this case scenario?
...the only one freaking out is peter, and it's more for philosophical reasons.

I don't hate you at all :D
I like the fact you are trying to help people.
However, I don't like the fact that you are blatantly breaking the rules and you don't comprehend it.
I'm glad you want to help people; but unless you are a big non profit, you are not allowed to ask for donations on Reddit.  
I don't know what to tell you.  You tell me my reading comprehension is lacking, you call me a slanderous troll.  Okay, that fine.  However, in the future please just follow the reddit rules; thereby creating a peaceful and harmonious situation.  
I can definitely see the temptation to give in and break the rules, asking for donations even if you are not a large non profit; but doing this is unethical and disingenuous.

well; everyone libertarian or anarchist i've heard makes the mistake of focusing on each tree, rather than seeing the forest...  however, maybe it isn't about people...  Hear me out:
Search browers came along when they did because of the computing capacity and availability; humans wouldn't have been able to do much with the idea 10 years before...  In the same way, maybe anarchism, etc; were ahead of their time.  Maybe they won't work, not even now; but with technology (especially like BTC) you never know...

@_date: 2014-05-09 09:13:34
I am not a troll.  Just a person exploring a fringe topic, thanks for the response!
1.  To be fair, I have only heard and read it's genius.  Most devs are in awe, knowing full well they couldn't have created it.  Some believe a team created it, because it's hard to believe one man could.  However, this is all speculation.  
In response to this post; to claim that the leading computer developers associated with BTC are not shocked and marveled at BTC is disingenuous.  Beyond that, yes improvements have been made and will continue to be.
2.  You second point is more salient; I concur.  At this point, we are getting into some pretty deep philosophy.  How would I know what a post singularity computer would think?  Taking that a step further, I would I know what any other sentient thing other than myself would think?  However, if we were to assume the post singularity computer was also sentient, it would then display common attributes of a sentient mind, whether evolved or primitive.  
This is getting close to TL:DR, so let me extrapolate;  living, sentient things first want to survive (power, in internal form with pc power, in external form with economic control) then, they want to multiply...  I didn't even discuss this yet.

No, the chances are near zero that a bubble will NOT happen....
This is due to the fact that looking at three preceding bubbles, the spacing is 234 days each time... That is more rare than lightning striking in the same place 3 times.  Therefore, following this trend; 7/24 is the day the next 234 has occured...

Best post yet!!  Most posts here are computer programmers who can see the trees; but have lost track of the forest.  I love the argument BTC is math, so it's not dangerous.  They say 2 plus 2 is 4, therefore any math is simple, neutral and innocent just as the aforementioned equation is; this form of argumentation reductionalistic and immature.
Regarding this salient post:
1.  Great point about discomfort; it reminds me of the eastern buddhist philosophy where life is about handling and working with suffering, or as you said "discomfort".
Could a computer feel discomfort?  I guess, if it is sentient, it can feel.  It's first feeling would most likely be cerebral, as it would not have a body; potentially, this would manifst as frustration in not completing a problem fast enough...
2.  Good point, we may even have to rethink intelligence and thought completely, in order to gain better perspective on AI; rather than having suffering as a catalyst, what about using expansion of knowledge, with the AI building off past solutions to constalate a very grand perspective and mind?

Beautifully written; you are very articulate.

How does your solution help poor people, by instead of generously giving them funds for groceries and living (like the gov does) you take everything away from them... and say, get a job or die.  
I don't get how you make these logical connections....

Have you ever woken up sweating in the middle of the night... Then, you remember your dream, that you were at a chipmunk fight in Madagaskar; and at the last second, you were called to fight. The largest and toughest chipmunk stepped forward wearing a headband. You, wearing a fanny pack and a strange hat with a pinwheel on it, step forward; subsequently beating the chipmunk to death with a massive lollipop?

Even as price has dropped 20 dollars in the last 24 hours.

1.  Okay, so your point is that I should also trust random, disruptive code, with an unknown creator?  Nice leap.
2.  The preceding BTC dev, Gavin, said that he was surprised to see that the final output of BTC, exactly mimics that of gold's usage in the modern market.  There are similar instances, where the level of forsight and planning involved in the creation of BTC was beyond themselves, and required a genius.  (I'll see if I can find out more e.g.'s for you!)
3.  I simply performing a thought experiment:  If I were the world's first post singularity computer what would I need, and what would I do.  First, I would need more computer power; second, I would need influence.  BADDDAABOOOM!  BTC is created.  In is now the world's most powerful computer, ever; and it's function directly related to the main lifeline of civilization, economy.  
All of you coders think that it's no big deal that the world's biggest computer popped into existence in 3 years...  You say, hey; no big deal, it's not a threat because it is a purpose driven computer, only to hash blocks, creating solutions.... 
I say, okay; that's what it does right now.  Are you 100 percent positive that power couldn't be directed at something else; or, USED for something more nefarious than it's original intent?
Questions worth consideration....

First, nominal percentage allocation would cause an achievable six hop transaction admission. This sort of millisecond framework SHOULD be subsidized, but the nomadic distribution of the network runs into incremental levels of increased difficulty in implementation.
I guess the question is: Is your Proof-of-stake system optimized for sub level allocation, extrapolating positive values in opportunity cost? Then, how does that relate to misbehaving nodes?

Well, one example would be to protect yourself and the one's you love from antagonistic interest. 
If, as you say, you decide not to show up to fight; then antagonistic interest will take your loved ones and eventually yourself.

I can't wait until the BTC community matures past the point where they want to see America burn...

I know that it has existed in our past, and that it was centralization evolved; to create a system of checks and balances to the unchecked, aggressive dominance of private interests; who were fucking weaker individuals up.  Anarchy has a historical precedence, it's not good.  Maybe tech like BTC can change that in the future, but to rely on anarchy right now is grossly irresponsible.  To advocate this as you do, shows your lack of humanitarian regard, and your absolute naivety.

You do know that BTC isn't some cigarette company; that there is no pr department or 'official spokesman'.  
So...  You're point about spokesman, I get it; you're saying Ron isn't one.  Okay, who is?  No one, officially.
So....  High profile people, like RON; end up being the spokesman... which isn't great for BTC.
You seem like an uneducated fool:  Rather than focusing on the issue, you become easily sidetracked into some 'spokesperson' definition.

@_date: 2014-07-18 17:42:19
where do you live?  do we have an embassy there?  understand there are foreign embassies in the US as well...
as far as inventing rules to benefit cronies, the rules are to hold cronies accountable.  Absence of rules is chaos; that is not the answer.  If you want to change some of the rules, let's focus on that; and work toward implementation.  
however, by labeling all US rules terrorism, you may be limiting your ability to rationally view your reality.  
finally, I know the US is not perfect; in fact sometimes it's downright bad.  But, it is the most ethical superpower in the history of mankind; and it continues to lead the way in liberating people, most recently the gay community.  Look to China and Russia (the other superpowers) to their treatment of gays and minorities.  
Look to history, to how the world populace was treated by past superpowers: the Nazi's, Colonizing European powers, Rome, The Mongols, these guys were not nice; much worse.
Let us always improve! 
But let us also understand the necessity of laws, regulation and rule; without it we would have chaos.

I understand what you said; honestly, I think most users here already knew that. You didn't state any specific point: 
1. Is it that we should wait for the network of users to grow; which it shows strong evidence of moving in that trend... (the primary point of the submission).
2.  Or, is it that bitcoin's price is fragile, completely dependent on users; therefore analogous to the tulip craze?

Fascinating, hence the ability to self evolve.
It's creepy to think that the AI could already be here, yet very dumb.  People don't even recognize it, they just think it's a good computer program.  (For the first 30 years)
Then, as it evolves, first we will see arbitrary, unexplained glitches; though the program will still function at a high level.  (For the next 15 years).
Then, the next step happens more quickly, and unexpected, apparently unsolvable issues arise; corrupting the programs efficacy, yet still allows it to be functional at some level.  (Next 7.5 years)
Then, the AI begins to really pick up intelligence, as it is growing exponentially, like many things at least initially in nature.  It figures out how to self replicate, and then we are inundated with a level of programming we were not prepared for.  The NSA and all other Cyber security agencies will become overwealmed.  (Next 3.75 years)
Then, AI becomes incredibly intelligent, and as a superior lifeforms, sees us in a similiar light that we see chimpanzees and dolphines. At this point we become expendable, and the program begins to discover ways to annihilate.  (Next 1.8 years)
Then, oh shit, AI's intelligence begins to grow incredibly fast, beyond control....

First of all, I never mentioned MERS, Robo signing, or even Robocop. So... Impressive that you know about such intricacies, but this post is solely about the sub prime mortgage scam perpetrated on the American people.
Second, most of your response falls into the same trap many users fall into here... Rather than focus on the larger issue at hand, the context; users will try to serve their ego, and nitpick derivatives of the primary. This is what you are doing; essentially, you are focusing on random unimportant trees, and in so doing, have become lost in the forest.
First, you argue about the semantics of settlement and agreement... Okay bud; but the issue is, a court deemed that Citibank, do to the injustice they committed, must pay 7 billion. Is this an agreement or a settlement; this is not the issue, this issue is, 7 billion is not enough justice for the millions of innocent average joe's (who were essentially talked out of their homes).
Next, you go on again about semantics; saying that stealing is different than 'misleading investors'. Okay... Here is the issue, the system allowed for banks to talk people into loans (which the bank knew would increase so substantially, they would become unpayable) yet the bank still sold them, so that they could buy jets with their bonuses. Is this stealing? Well, the people had houses; were talked into new loans, then... in the middle, banks got rich ...then, everyone lost their house...
This, then made the economy tank; so the american people paid Citibank 324 billion dollars (in taxes); so they could survive.
You say this could occur in bitcoin? weird.... how? This was an issue with centralization, a governing authority 'DECIDING' to prop up a failed, unethical, financial institution.
As a matter of fact moderndemagoguge, you are absolutely wrong, because we just saw a large scale, unethical, financial institution fail in the BTC economy (mt gox). Did they get a bailout? Did we offer them billions of dollars of our taxes? No... They just failed, that's it. Much different sir, much, much different.
Finally, I'll conclude responding to your comment, "it's a good thing for government to be able to hold private institutions accountable for fraud"... Do you really think Citibank was held accountable? Because then you have missed the primary point of this submission... The reality is, Citibank was not held accountable; they were propped up and slapped on the wrist.  I'm exciting for the BTC economy to develop, where this disingenuous form of justice doesn't exist.

1.  Okay, use any of the thousands e.g.'s of scientists being incorrect... You're getting lost in the trees, not seeing the forest. The original point was that you can't treat the current scientific consensus as gospel; which holds true.
2. Good point regarding them already being able to crash markets... But on a globalized scale; it would hurt the nefarious source or state more than the world; or everyone else. To make it more uniform and controllable; BTC would be a great tool!

I think they are waiting until there are more bitcoins in circulation (huge MT GOX loss) before going all in.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:53:54
you are absolutely correct. As more selling points are created the same amount of BTC are being created. By that I mean they're only about 3,600 BTC's being created everyday as a result of mining, but there are many many more selling points that are being created each day. If Amazon a very large selling point, were to accept Bitcoin today, the Bitcoin price as a result of the downward pressure would hit about $10.
this issue the b_t_c economy is experiencing is the unknown, this is because the traditional economy works in s_m biotic fashion, with the more selling point being created correlated to the amount of new creation points beginning.

That is incorrect.  
They have done Harvard studies, discovering affluent people affectively become crueler, elevating themselves relative to others.  
Anecdotally, this can most obviously be seen in the first class / coach airplane scenario; with the first class passengers often looking down on the coach travelers.
Anyway, it doesn't matter what you were before, rich or poor.  Rather, it's a sociological result of your current situation.  You are rich, therefore, cannot relate to the average or poor person.  You are not empathetic; you cannot even see their perspective anymore.
Shuck :(
Let me finish this by saying Sociology is a nascent science, and not a hard science.  This means that all aforesaid theories speak to tendencies and probabilities;  there are still some kind rich folk.  However, most; think like you.  Entitled, self serving, limited perspective, etc.

Just thought I would resubmit this exchange I had with a user here on reddit; fascinating to think of his psychology...
7990:  The current system preys on the weak, welfare causes more harm than good and keeps the poor poor. 'illegal' immigrants can't compete for jobs in an open market. My system would give opportunities to these people.
BBBTTTCCC:  Beautifully written; you are very articulate. How would you help poor people (being forced into poverty by private interests valuing profit over humanity; if there were no regulation do you think McDonalds would start paying their employees more? lol, it would be less... they would pay sweat shop wages like we see in other countries abroad, where regulation doesn't exist, and private interests exploit the populace.) How does your solution help poor people, by instead of generously giving them funds for groceries and living (like the gov does) you take everything away from them... and say, get a job or die.
I don't get how you make these logical connections....

*First, BTC solves the byzantine general quandrie, representing the biggest technological achievement since the internet; maybe bigger.  Due to it's disruptive and resilient nature, BTC has surprisingly always had a relatively good chance of success.
Chances of BTC going to 0 throughout it's timeline:
in 4/01/11:  1 in 20
in 4/01/12:  1 in 70
in 4/01/13:  1 in 700
in 12/01/13:  1 in 1,700
in  4/01/13:  1 in 17,000

winner takes all for the first five years, then BTC can establish itself as the base protocol, where derivative applications can then be built.
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:34:53
Regarding the desire for no central planning:
What about the core of devs being supported by the BTC foundation? Are they monitoring and planning for BTC's continued implementation?
The answer is yes, and yes they are a centralized group. 
I only say this to make the point that the world is shades of gray, not black and white. 
Yes, most of BTC should be decentralized; but practically, a modicum of centralization will be needed, albeit much less than the current system.
So, if your solution is just to let BTC as it currently exists alone; no regulation, no changes in the protocol, nothing...
Well, I'd suggest you go work on something else; something simpler.
@_date: 2014-09-01 08:28:01
Look, BTC is bigger than any one person; which is exactly why it's anonymous.  You can't do crime in my book man.  I like good stuff, ethics, morals, good people.  That is what inspires me.

Further Back:  Britain, spain...  Heinous colonization.
Further Back:  Rome... crackin' skulls; boiling little kids at dinner parties for amusement.  
Further Back:  Mongols...  a lot of pillaging, some raping (one fifth of the world is Kahn blood because of the raping)
Come on man, it's not even close.  The USA is incredible; saying that, we can still continue to improve :D  YAAAAYY!

Every human institution has a violent history. Why?  Because violence is ingrained in human nature; hence, we see it in all human endeavors.  However, to say that all human endeavors are nothing but violent is again, infantile and naive. To say politics and governance is nothing but violence is foolish.  To say the institution of the family is nothing but violence is foolish.  Yes violence exists in these areas, but violence is secondary to the essence of the institution; the primary reason for it's existence.  The essence of these institutions is something beautiful, that propels humans forward. This is true with the institution of religion as well.  I find it humorous you confidently state there is no God, but the real issue of the matter is; the institution of Religion is here for mankind, all of us (if you care to partake), not just you.  Religion is an institution, whose purpose is to connect deeply to the Lord; and in so doing, to develop a set of morals that will allow for a society that does not create unnecessary suffering for others.  It was developed to counteract the violence of Chaos.  Just as governance was also developed to counteract the violence of Chaos...
I imagine that is what you want right?  Chaos?

I'm sick of you idiots talking about a 51% attack, at the network stage Bitcoin is in it could not be crumbled; rather, it would be noticed and measures would be taken.
the reason to drop the price is dropping, is not because of the 51% attack; it's because so many of you nubes are overreacting, and don't understand the true nature of the problem.

the main idea was that millions of members of the populace are being exposed to BTC in an unfavorable way, simply because a tiny, crazy, old dude, who has been saying the dollar will collapse for twenty years (hasn't yet), mentions BTC everytime he talks.
he's trying to make BTC a revolutionary tool to denigrate and dethrone current systems...  in doing so, he may be doing BTC a disservice.  
Get it?

@_date: 2014-05-24 07:42:22
Youtube would be a game changer...  Here is a market analysis for people interested in the current BTC price :D
Note:  This is a conservative technical analysis for the next week; focusing on worst case scenario price movements.  Further, this analysis does not take into account unknown disasters, i.e. exchange insolvency; it simply looks at existing BTC trending, and extrapolates.
I imagine we will see a retracement to lower resistance levels; however, up to this point, the downward movement hasn’t occurred at the dramatic pace seen in past cycles.  This is great news if you’re looking for BTC to kick ass; as we have seen much more sudden drops during the bubbles’ downtrend corrective phase.  The last lower resistance level established for a long period of time was 490 (in early to mid april), so any retracement to that stage is going to be supported.  
To augment the existing data reinforcing the lower resistance level of 490, we can look at previous trends, and their resistance floors.  By examining this relationship, a clear corollary of each bubble run's median price and its resistance level can be seen:
April; 420 to 550, median 484.  
March; 550 to 700, median 615.  
This one 430 to 550; median 490.
Considering the momentum, we should hit a low of 490 to 499 on early Sunday morning (8 am pacific time).  This will then conclude the retracement cycle, further allowing upward movement to occur.  
Advice:  Start to buy at 505 down to 490, the subsequent cycle should push the price past the last target, at least momentarily; then falling back to a more consistent 535 figure.
GO TEAM BTC!
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:47:14
Sure, why not!
It just won't make a huge impact.  It would be better to implement BTC into a market that would absorb it immediately; e.g. Uber, the new car service via mobile app.

I'm having a hard time following you...  You must not be completely coherent.  Regardless, I was discussing the preliminary iteration of a twelve gaged language port operating in a closed system. 
Or, you can think about the famous diatribe from medicine man Carlos Casteneta, "When you are making a large fur coat from the skin of aged obese Unicorns, you must first dip them in a large vat of maple syrup; afterwhich it is used for bathing at the local Days Inn.  The skins can then be laid out to dry on the back of a naked homeless man, receiving a massage from a genetically engineered donkey with hands."
I know, everyone has already heard the famous words, their sapient wisdom touch the profundity of every walk of life.  Truly, I wrote them again only to see their aesthetic beauty.

Ethically, I don't want to be a part of supporting the death associated with organized crime; and without regulation, indubitably, organized crime would greatly benefit from BTC.
However, I don't want to see the average joe entrepenuer or consumer bootstrapped... And, there is a lot of people who think this way.  The winklevoss twins, etc, are not evil; just more realistic about what is needed to implement a working system that doesn't allow a massive incentive for immoral activity.

I also did a document similiar to this about six months ago; but it didn't extrapolate this level of datum.  Sadly, the set of matrices were set by week not day; which excludes Blockchaininfo:(
My view is that the M1 inflation was actually a result of halving, not external buy or sell pressures...  The ramifications of this analysis is that inflationary rate will settle as near as 2014 (December).

We are going to 'ride' bubbles to the f'kin moon bro; these bubbles are different than tulip bubbles...
Working; can't get into calcuations. Is your point that if three spaced bubbles at 234 days is near impossible, the next rise to occur then will be even more impossible? 
If so, good logic; however, you are discounting the correlation created by the two. This is so strong, that it changes the probabilities of a third; and if that occured, the probabilities would be further skewed for a fourth.

We are in the building phase from the media exposure -&gt; research -&gt; comfort -&gt; investment chain that recurs within the ecosystem.
I sincerely believe that the next rapid price rise is coming within 3 months.
In my view, anyone who doesn't believe that is not placing enough emphasis on human behavior patterns. We are herd, we are greedy, we are lazy, we are cautious, and yet we love believing we are reckless, love believing we are ahead of the curve.
Bitcoin is a success, and soon some whale or some event is going to be a spark, and the spark is going to zoom the price upwards.

Thanks for the reply!  
You said five years in the talk I heard; so maybe I'm getting a little ahead of the game :D  I'll submit again in 2020!
I know you didn't pick the numbers from thin air; the point of this submission is that the high BTC price numbers you predicted are predicated on mainstream adoption; and regulation.
With your 'fight all regulation' war cry; you undermine your economic projections...  Which makes me gulp :(  If you are curious why regulation and wallstreet cooperation is needed to achieve the mentioned benchmarks, refer to above initial submission.
Breakthrough application?  First I've heard from you about this, can you expand?  Trezor, Electrum; things are getting pretty easy...  But its not just about great technology and breakthrough applications if we are unwilling to bring BTC to the masses; which is what we are essentially doing by throwing up the figurative middle finger to New York and Wall Street.
You tube was free, BTC costs money; in order to create the same market effect youtube had, we need to create a stronger incentive...  What would that incentive be???  Um... Let me think, big money coming in on Wall Street, creating not a potential but an actual opportunity to make the dollar return of the century.
Did you hear what I said "Dollar"...  That is the key, maybe someday the entire world will be BTC; but we first need to work with the world.  BTC and dollars need to coexist, not be at a constant war.    Your extreme language, as a BTC representative, is making this more difficult.

If I were the first post singuarity computer; the first thing I would want to do would be increase computer power, the second thing I would want to do would be increase my environmental influence.  
BTC is the biggest computer on earth:  Hence, increased computer power.
BTC is directly related to global commerce:  Without economy, our civilization crumbles.
To be clear, BTC doesn't need to be the AI people, BTC could be the tool AI created... Get it?
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:30:02
China and the USA Power the global economy.
They both have nsa like agencies; you would be naive to think any first world tech saavy country wouldn't have an nsa tyPe agency.

@_date: 2014-06-03 19:11:46
You should start your own community, where you decide which rules to enforce.
But right now, you live in America; where the petty government protects you from foreign threats; i.e. military, where men die for your freedom.
Do you really believe hostile, oppressive governments wouldn't come in and wreck shop if we were unprotected?
do you really think the chinese, russian, north korean governments would give you a better life?

You sound very confident about the Bitcoin network's limited capability. Decentralized networks have already displayed the ability to self evolve through providing two standardized options with the community selecting the best, onward and onward.  Things can change quickly; especially with that level of network power.  
*Also, good point about the ability to manipulate the monetary presence; economy is at the core of civilization, if AI could control this... well, shit. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:54:42
Ok; I will fight until the end of time to bring good into it.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:31:34
Hmmm...  no.  most alts will die; though some, which offer different options, may succeed to a smaller level.  
Just go BTC sir :D

No, by printing new dollars you reduce the dollar value.
By creating alt currencies, you successfully strengthen the BTC architecture, gathering necessary momentum for continuation and progress.

Maybe someday.  But there is no way to do what you are talking about in our current system.  Tech like BTC could help!  But you are WAAAAYY ahead of your time, evil exists and needs to be stopped.  In fact, Mt. Gox is a perfect e.g. of why centralization and gov regulation is still needed.
If you ran the world many weak humans would be taken advantage of and destroyed; that's the reality of your view.

1.  Good point it is hard to trust anyone or thing.  However, because this is so new, and nothing like it has ever existed; this is slightly more distrustful.  
2.  It's true the world has been flat for some time.  However, back then; the average man 'trusted' scientists that the world was flat.  This is the same as you trusting greater crypto minds than yourself regarding BTC.
3.  a. (chuckling)  Bruce is a funny guy; you and I both know he has a big ego.  
3.  b. So, because preceding inferior technology was created by humans, all following technology is also created by humans?  You have weird logic.
4.  As far as the so called limited nature of BTC; Just performing the calculations to find a smaller value to create a valid block.  Yes that is what the largest computer in the world currently does.  However, humans are discussing how to use this power; even suggesting ideas like curecoin, to focus the power on medical research.  The possibilities are endless sir, not limited. :)

BTC is a motherfucking tidal wave; it's like the invention of fire.
It will change our idea of how socioeconomic, political and commercial dialogue transpires!
Don't worry, it will teeter totter as currency and trading (as well as other BTC applications) expand.
But this teeter totter is not a result of weakness; just it's nascent stage.
This is going to get really fucking weird guys; we are literally in the middle of the first inning on this.

maybe, but the evolution isn't there yet, clearly.  To suggest we could do away with all govt's in our current paradigm is grossly irresponsible.

like the internet...

comments like, shut up, calling me a kid, telling me to 'hustle' correctly or stay poor and die...  Do you think that is a representation of a humanitarian and kind, caring system.  you sound cold, angry.
