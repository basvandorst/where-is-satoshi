I'm imagining this guy trying to barter for a half eaten rat from a fellow starving survivor of the-shit-that-went-down asking "can I pay with bitcoin?"

And don't post a key (even public) to one of your personal storage wallets. Set up a new wallet if you want to ask for funds etc. You can be identified and targeted via information connected to your social-media footprint.

Trezor hooked up to Exodus sounds ideal. You can check and track your portfolio easily with Exodus using a simple password but to transact you have to connect and authenticate via your Trezor.

i'm worried that this aggressive drop will be pushing out the little investors and when the market comes back a bigger % of BTC will be in the hands of the funds/institutions. Not that  i object to them entirely but it's a shame that a major wealth re-distribution opportunity might be blunted

Not asking, hoping that the opportunity would be seized and that would be the result

According to those numbers the profit is $90bn on $624bn after nine years. This works out at about 1.6% profit per year... which is a terrible investment

I wonder sometimes if BTC could be abandoned if it became too captured by industry. In that situation, where people saw a better option, I would hope they would migrate some or all their usage over. We now have an global, opt-in reserve currency without an enforced monopoly and with multiple competitors for the first time. If the one market gets distorted it could damage itself badly.

What in your research pointed to today?

If making a hard fork less likely is good for you then yes!
