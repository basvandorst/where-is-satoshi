Buttons. Don’t use hardware if you’re scared it’ll come with virus. 
It’s not done via browser technically. It’s done by sending coins to your ledger key

Wouldn’t that.. defeat the whole purpose of what your “offline” device is for? As soon as you open it to WiFi it’s potentially in trouble/hackable. 
If your real question is “can I have an iPhone dedicated to just wallets?” Then yes. In theory, yes of course you can do this. If you have two phones then yeah go ahead. This would make you an easy target if anyone knew that you had a phone dedicated to BTC storage, so don’t tell anyone, never connect to public WiFi even on the subway, turn off Bluetooth and keep it off, etc. 
If you’re looking for pure offline storage then just use a Trezor or ledger or WASABI with a desktop that would never be connected to any internet. 
Your internet at home is not foolproof either
I personally have a wallet on my iPhone and a Trezor. I use Wasabi still.

You have to understand this is a game to heavyweight investors. A swing of 10% is huge for people that have millions in the coin. 
You really don’t think, even for a minute, the trump tweet wasn’t planned?! He rolls with the biggest financial advisors and heavyweights. He just made them so much money.

the system requires an email or phone number to send money. According to anecdotes in the Times’s story, this allows scammers to register with your phone number and receive cash transfers in your stead. Security measures vary by the bank, and some do not notify customers “when new recipients are linked to their Zelle accounts.” And while Zelle says customers are not liable for fraudulent activities, it does not consider customers “knowingly” sending money to be fraudulent, even if the intended recipient does not get the money. Its website states that neither Zelle nor the banks that use it offer a protection program.
They are getting you committed in fraud. And can easily use your number you would be liable for EVERY PENNY after sending them all the bitcoin. Then you owe all the dollars you spent on bitcoin. In other words ,They’re getting BTC for free and you’re paying for it. And you would be “knowingly” committing fraud. They’d get away free as a bird. You can face major paybacks and criminal charges.

A lower long term interest rate is a sign of lower inflation rate in the long term but also lower e ie inimical activity . Moreover , the Fed is expected to lower the interest rate once more in July confirming an expected scenario of low inflation and lower economic activity or recession . This scenario means lower stock prices and also low assets prices in general . As another asset class , Bitcoin as  gold , silver etc will see a decline in prices . In conclusion : in a recessionary environment . Bitcoins should see a decline in its price 
Unless the expected recession is accompanied by a loss of trust in the dollar plus severe markets turmoil in that case it will be a flight to safety and dollar holder will buy gold , silver , other currencies and Bitcoin pushing its price up . Possible causes of severe disruption are a Brexit hard landing , an outright trade war with China and a possible war with Iran . In conclusion if the recession is purely monetary without loss of trust in the dollar then Bitcoin prices will decline alongside the price of other assets such as gold . If the recession is accompanied by a loss of trust in the dollar plus major markets turmoil then the price of Bitcoin will increase alongside the price of gold and other protective assets .
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:32:38
Yes these are all correct. All of these quotes are specifically for “bad” crypto investors. If you’re using it for fraud, or criminal activities, you should be scared. Just like criminals should be scared using USD for criminal activities. 
If you’re clean and “good” investor, you’re OK. Pay your taxes and report your earnings. You’ll be ok. 
They will not be making BTC illegal. You won’t be put in jail for doing nothing wrong. Nor will they freeze your accounts unless they have a reason to except your engaged in criminal acts, like fraud, tax evasion, or money laundering. 
If you’re “good” then you’ll be all good. 
If you’re “bad” or “operating in shadows” you should be scared.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:13:48

You’re the f’in idiot. Have you heard of a wire transfer?  If you’re so worried about a measly 3 days do that. 
Also it takes 3-4 days for you to withdraw perhaps since it has to go through bank if you use ACH in that time, but you can still avoid major fees and also get the BTC immediately if you do it this way.
@_date: 2019-07-16 10:42:48
Unfortunately no. It will be 16 days, but that’s good. You won’t want to move it for at least 3-4 months

This would enormously indirectly devalue the dollar. 
The fact the president came out and said it’s based on thin air, and then if he did something like this. 
It wouldn’t happen. And if it did it would have to be so hush hush and behind the scenes, that people would go crazy not knowing where it went. Then the exchanges would leak what happened, and further devalue US/USD and probably escalate a horrible trade and money manipulation war. And if anything, BTC is global and cannot be stopped so he would directly be propping up BTC in its support.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:31:26

It’s a Ponzi scheme. It’s gambling. The more adopters, the higher the price. 
It’s completely unstable and can’t be used as a currency  too well. As you sit at dinner, price can go up or down astronomically. Life becomes a financial gamble. 
It can’t be supported like that. There needs to be stability once all 21 million are mined. Until then, it can’t be trustworthy.

@_date: 2019-07-01 03:47:05
I understand your concerns, and I sympathize with your loss. 
That being said, the only way BTC can technically be shut down would be if the governments globally conspired together to outlaw exchanges. Even then, new ones would pop up as they do already. The decentralization would make it extremely difficult and also they wouldn’t do it because governments are already buying bitcoin for safety and risk aversion. 
Like you said, govt wants $ and wants to be rich. They always hedge their bets. If they did this vs. bitcoin they would lose enormous value. 
The best part about BTC is that it’s a mainstream coin and with so many vested interests it’s VERY slim for this scenario you are describing to take place. Of course it can however, and that’s a risk we take. 
There is a risk in every crypto investment and that comes with the territory, unfortunately the risk is astronomically higher with the alt coin, especially those that don’t even have strong followings like the one you mentioned. 
Keep in mind BTC is in the news/media and is being discussed constantly. Can’t put my finger on another coin like that besides LTC potentially. 
Your example is a micro example indeed, and I will hedge my bet that it won’t happen to BTC. I do understand the risks, but am willing to invest because the payout is huge. 
Unfortunate this happened to you and I hope it doesn’t again because I know for sure if it happened to me it would leave a bad taste in my mouth. 
Try to stick with the main exchanges and larger currencies, for now.

Bitcoin is good to hedge against stocks since more and more see it as a store of value and safe haven like virtual gold.

Not smart. It fluctuates. And companies don’t match bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:56:38
You don’t need to buy a whole BTc!! You can just buy $10 worth!
And go 100% BTC.

You don’t buy a hardware wallet on eBay you idiot.
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:45:29
Hey silly question here but:
I think I will go with Trezor or Ledger. I am wondering; to reinvest my money in BTC and have it grow, do I need to constantly transfer my money back and forth?
Or will my money still be reflecting in Coinbase AND The hardware wallet? I am worried if I transfer from COINBASE to a hardware wallet then my money won’t be making money/being invested anymore. Is this true? Or is it just like I have my BTC backed up on the wallet, and it’s still being invested on Coinbase/making me money?
Last question: which wallet would you recommend using with a transfer from Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:01:03
He’s actually correct. I love the doubt. Please sell and let me get your satoshis.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:58:09
Listen. You guys are clearly novice in this. 
The first drive it dipped the same amount and hit 17 in 6 days. Chill out and hodl
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:51:27
Use BRD for iOS and Mycelium for Android they are apparently the best. 
I can’t speak to yours because I’ve never tried it but quite frankly the safest is a hardware ledger, or desktop wasabi
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:43:17
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:56:20
It’s early friend. Give it 2 years max
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:20:14
Thanks for the tip! I did some research and it does seem better. 
The fees to buy seen much better and I like the order limit function as well as analytics. Quite frankly the only cost I’m anticipating that will fraction my profit is the withdrawal fee once I’ve banked. I’m lamenting the thought of having to give even 5% to these guys. 
Is Coinbase pro ultimately free on both ends of the trade?

Thief. Reporting you just Incase this happens !
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:38:42
When you can, get a ledger. You have a hold period and enough time to get it now where when you receive the package you’ll be able to deposit. 
Do NOT keep your coins on any exchange. And mycelium has a “miner fee” as well as many glitches.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:38:29
Risky business friend. Very passive playing which leads to passive gains.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:43:38
Why not mycelium? I find mycelium to be fantastic even for iPhone. 
—&gt;The Electrum wallet, for example, uses its own proprietary protocol which isn't privacy-preserving. The Mycelium wallet calls servers that the Mycelium company runs. In addition, there are denial-of-service vectors (by having to run lots of filters) to exploit servers that respond to BIP0037 requests.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:50:48
Get BRD wallet for iPhone. Mycelium for Android. ledger for hardware. Wasabi for desktop
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:11:44
Yes sir what you are asking is correct. Do immediately. Get to Coinbase then transfer to ledger.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:52:07
I hope they realize their panic produces steam

You.. can’t.. just .. do. That.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:26:58
Bro it’s been 16 mins.
It takes at least 30 to confirm the transactions
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:05:36
This is so important for us. Once they realize they are going to dump all into BTC cause they see VALUE
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:01:21
Only sell if you need emergency money

Get out immediately dude.
Dude Gemini is BAD. Trust me please.
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:43:50
It’s not about that. It’s not about the denomination. It’s about the value of the coin. 
STOP FOCUSING ON THE DENOMINATION OR YOU WONT GET RICH.

Go to Coinbase.com. Connect your bank. Buy as much as you want. 
Coinbase is verified and has not been hacked (majorly) yet. I use it and it’s fantastic, albeit their fees are “high,” but what are a few dollars compared to being a millionaire with a higher level of security and safety to protect your future investment?
Go buy. Now. Stop waiting. $100 won’t make you rich AF.

Sometimes it can take 30 min - 2 hour
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:22:00
Both are good, ledger better and more sleek. Can’t go wrong with either. 
Step1: get Coinbase, an exchange for crypto and probably one of the best, if not the best. Get Coinbase PRO for smaller fees and better analytics to make more informed decisions faster. BTC fluctuates rapidly. Stay in the know. 
Step2: go to ledger website and buy ledger nano s. Do this now as there is 5-10 shipping period and we will come back to this step as it’s extremely crucial. No need for the LEDGER X especially if a newbie. I have both and only difference is size and amount of text on screen to be honest. Not worth 2x price. 
Step2: buy BTC directly through Coinbase by connecting your bank info. You will want to convert to USD at some point and bank transfers allow you to immediate purchase BTC at the buy price you want, when you click the button. 
Step3: accumulate bitcoin and hodl. (HOLD)
Step4: CONSTANTLY back up your BTC on ledger from step 2. your BTC on Coinbase is not yours it’s technically Coinbase’s. This is where step 2 is VITAL. you should have ordered you ledger nano s OUTSIDE storage by now. To keep your BTC and actually own it, you need to put it in your wallet, the ledger. Until then it’s not yours and if Coinbase gets hacked then goodbye BTC and whatever money you invested to buy it. 
Step 5: rinse and repeat. Whatever BTC stores in wallet doesn’t need to be available on any other exchanges or wallets anywhere other than to let it sit and invest and make money for you. 
Once you back up “x” amount of BTC on your wallet, it’s yours and no one can take it unless they steal it WITH your pins. After 3 incorrect pins it wipes. DO NOT connect ledger to Bluetooth as it’s hackable. 
Step6: rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat (keep backing up all bitcoin earned on coin base directly to wallet WHENEVER You buy more. IF YOU DONT PLAN ON BUYING ANYMORE BTC EVER AND ARE IN IT FOR THE RIDE, then just hodddddllll I’m wallet until you go to lambo store. 
Questions? Let me know.
@_date: 2019-12-30 16:15:14
Yeah it didn’t look like a tangible payment option at all.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:30:25
Mycelium for Android. BRD for iOS 
Wallets are a must have 
Also there will be a holding period before you can transfer most likely
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:09:18
My friend, BUY. Today. 
It will increase to $20,000 minimum by end of year, and upwards of 100,000 in 2020. 
Just buy, sit back, and watch the money roll in.
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:19:46
This is a scam. They give you money and have you fraudulently purchase bitcoin. Then you face all the legal repercussions and they get away with a shitload of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:00:21
This is the problem. They think it competes with BTC. 
BTC is doomed.
