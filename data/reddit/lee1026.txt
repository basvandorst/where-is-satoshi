The actual knowledge needed isn't very much. A basic knowledge how digital signing works is enough background to understand how bitcoin works, and by extension, invent it.
The hard part in inventing it is to put every concept together into something usable. The harder part of inventing bitcoin is how he/she/it/them managed to convince people to use it.

0.9%, because 2% cashback cards is easy to get. Certainly easier than convincing them to switch to bitcoin. When I looked a year or so ago, the bid/ask spread and the exchange fees were well in excess of 1% if I were to buy and the other side sell.

At a basic level, it is basically just a chain of any single proof of work. Proof of work is easy enough to come up with if you know how SHA1 works.

The Martha Stewart story went like this. The CEO of ImClone have insider information and the duty to the company. The CEO of ImClone was trying to dump shares (illegal!), and they did it via a broker. The broker have a duty to not trade on insider information that the clients bring in, so there is still an chain of imputed duty.
Note that this whole thing still come down to whether your information actually come from an actual employee at the company - if she demonstrated that she performed her own studies that the drugs were no good, she could trade to her heart's content.

Not how the (American) law works. Insider trading laws all work on the idea that insider trading is in violation of the duty from management to the shareholders. If an outsider gleamed the information independently, say, by chartering helicopters to observe oil wells to track how well an oil company is doing, that information isn't public, but it is still tradable.

As the CME and the CBOE discovered when they tried to build bitcoin futures, transferring BTC is heinously difficult in a way that you can be sure will satisfy a judge.
To make a long story short, it isn't obvious how to define legally "WTF is bitcoin anyway" In other words, in the event of a hard fork, which branch wins? It isn't obvious that judges will agree that transferring bitcoin directly to someone's address counts as giving them money. This is why most businesses work off direct deposit, where the paycheck arrives in an account with the employee's name on it.
The CME and CBOE ended up giving up on the idea of transferring bitcoin and made the bitcoin futures contract cash-settled because of all of the potential legal issues.

The futures contract, for say, oil, isn't mostly about people who want to make or take delivery. If you drill for oil in California, shipping it to Cushing OK makes no sense. Instead, you short the future in Cushing, close the future in Cushing when it comes to delivery time, and sell your oil to someone in California.
The number of people who buy oil related products to burn is much larger than the oil on the commodities markets.

That is certainly how the legal system should work; I am not sure that is not how it works. For example, today, there are actually laws that explicitly makes writing bad checks a crime. If that legal theory is correct, then it is hard see why they bothered to pass these laws.
For that matter, it isn't obvious that it will hold up in court that a double spend means that I didn't pay; if I trade in a car to a car dealer for a motorcycle, and the dealer realizes a hour later that the car is in fact worthless because a problem he didn't realize at the time, it is most definitely not my problem.

A 51% is a very real danger, and it will only grow more dangerous as the reward falls. Unlike the bitcoin cheer leaders, I suspect it is only a matter of time before someone spends the few tens of millions of dollars to fully take over the network, and then keep migrating to different proof of work to keep the network shutdown.
But that is because a 51% attack on hashes would actually work, and a big attack on adding evil nodes (other then DDOS all existing full nodes, which probably would be cheap enough to do, and probably quite effective) would simply not do anything.
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:05:52
Anyone who care about the result can keep track if orphaning takes place. As each block will be signed by the record keeper of the chain, he will have a hard time explaining why there is a big orphaned chain.
For real world applications, someone in the physical world needs to do an action based on what happens in the "blockchain". For example, for colored coins trading cars, someone needs to physically hand over the car at some point or another. That someone is the natural guardian of the chain. If he clearly and obviously does something evil, you sue; much the same as if he drove off with the car and ignore your colored bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:28:50
On the other hand, if Bitcoin falls, he will be in great shape. With the laws the way they are, I think this quite a good idea - there are basically three ways things can turn out:
1. Bitcoin skyrockets. He simply defaults, and loses the 50 bitcoin in the downpayment. Many states are no-recourse states, so the creditor can't touch any other part of his property.
2. Bitcoin plummets. His loans becomes very cheap, and he effectives gains 400*(whatever bitcoin is worth today) dollars.
3. Bitcoin goes sideways, in which case it is just a normal mortgage.
In other words, as the chances of bitcoin plummets is greater then 10%, he wins. And I think the real chance is a good bit higher then 10%.

National currencies are extremely liquid compared to bitcoin, so I wouldn't worry about what if people were to use bitcoin as a currency instead as an investment.
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:03:02
But you have to weigh it against the massive cost of actually selling it. I see a massive number of ads from the ASIC companies, which can't be cheap. There are also costs in the form of support, shipping, and the 2-3 days where it is not mining but in transit.
And given the depreciation rate of ASIC miners (30-50% a month), an ASIC miner will need to have an extremely high discount rate for it to be worthwhile to sell with all of those sky high costs instead of simply mining themselves.
Assuming 3 days of downtime for the packaging and shipping, we lose 7% of the value of the chip. Assuming that it can mine profitably for 3 months, that means that the fab in question must value cash at 30+% a year. At that point, credit cards seem like a better idea.

Bitcoin will certainly make corruption problems worse, a lot worse, as a fair amount of the money laundering laws that bitcoin help people get around is designed to stop corruption.

One potential attack is that those mini-pools wouldn't be known to the public at all - they would just look like individual miners. Everyone else would just be getting really, really unlucky all the time.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:33:25
Yeah. The key is that people will have to be willing to spend a huge amount of money to defend against our attacker. "Huge" is an intentionally vague term. If we are looking at a future where terrorists are using bitcoin to launder money and carry out attacks, that number can be in the billions. If you are trying to defend against someone shorting the currency massively and profiting from destroying it, millions will probably do fine. Trying to stop script kiddies from attacking for the lolz will probably only require thousands.
With the ever diminishing return model of these currencies though, it is hard to see any of them surviving an attacker with resources in terms of billions of USD. (adjusted for inflation to 2014) Simply put, even if Bitcoin miners sees the kind of revenue that Visa+Mastercard sees, an attacker with billions of dollars of resources can still take it down.

So if you call these institutions "banks" and the lenders "bank shareholders", you have more or less described an investment bank such as Goldman Sachs. If you permit these institutions to put investors on different layers, such that some investors get paid before others, you will eventually reach a commercial bank, like Citi or Chase.
And modern banking functions surprisingly similar to how you described it - banks hates holding on to loans. They much prefer to package tons of loans into a bond and then sell the bonds. So there are mortgage backed securities, car loan backed securities, and so on and so forth.

You won't get 0.1% of the remittance market with 200 ATMs. That is about 1 per country. To be practical, you will need a lot more than that. To put into perspective what you are talking about, there is about 2.2 million ATMs in the world. If the number of Bitcoin ATMs is 0.1% of that, we are looking at 2.2K ATMs. Which brings down the revenue of an ATM to a bit over 2K a year. Would that pay for everything that you need to operate an ATM in a poor country with dubious security and infrastructure? I doubt that very much.
And of course, you have to deal in the fact that even 1% isn't particularly cheap. It is about par for credit cards. Square charges 3%, and the sender gets 1-2%, netting around 1-2% for square.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:09:55
The problem is that even if the exchanges were perfectly aware of it, it isn't obvious what they can do about it. The attacker can easily have the attack come from a million different address if that is what it takes, and if you have more than 51%, even an infinite number of confirmations won't save you.

I agree that the analogy doesn't fly for practical purposes, but I am not sure if that is how the law sees it - buying with bitcoin is currently bartering, and bartering tend to have very little law enforcement other then "buyer be aware".
On the last point, I was thinking that hackers go around the place framing people. After all, credit fraud is a jail-able offense and very damaging to the mark. So it is simply something that hitmen would go around doing. A hit can be worth a lot more then someone's wallet. Blackmail also works.

The big danger that I see is a miner that have a policy of "we will process a transaction that arrives later, as long as it have at least 50% fees". Even if this miner have a relatively small amount of hash power (1-10%), it would render bitcoin useless for any kind of face to face transactions. Online transactions will be heavily hindered unless if this problem with slow confirmations is solved.
That miner would probably cause bitcoin's value to plunge quite a bit, but then again, getting to 1-10% isn't quite THAT hard. The latest card from butterfly labs cost about $5 per GH. You need about 180TH to reach 1%. That means that you need to invest about a million. If you can get a large short position in bitcoin before you do this, you can easily make more money from the resulting chaos then you paid for the cards.

In theory, the order of withdrawals shouldn't matter - when the fund loses money, all shares in the funds lose money, and so you lose the same amount whether you do it early or later. In practice, because the bond market have limited liquidity, the order does matter, and that is how things blew up.

Why would they want to pay their expenses in bitcoin? It doesn't offer any improvements over ACH for large business to large business transactions. In fact, bitcoin have a much higher transaction cost then ACH.

There is a few big upsides to using a blockchain:
1. Security. If someone breaches the security of the sponsor, the most damage he can do is to perform a double spend attack or deny other people's transactions for long enough for the sponsor to catch up to it. He can't do much else. Compare that to a major credit card breach.
2. Anonymity, as the people who trade these colored coins don't have to let the sponsor know who they are until it is time to take delivery.
3. From the sponsor's perspective, anytime someone loses the private key, it becomes a gift to the sponsor. That is going to be very valuable to the sponsor.

Any interested party would only have to spend more than all of the miners to win. All of the miners are in it to make money from the new block reward. The new block reward is halving every 4 years. Which means that the attack just gets easier over time. Now, I am willing to bet that the reason why they haven't attacked is that they just don't care enough, but there are no foreseeable future where bitcoin becomes too big to attack, just because there isn't enough mining revenue to keep the attack at bay from any large government that is truly determined.

ACH is probably just bad enough to be terrible, and just good enough to not get replaced. The Fed floats ideas to upgrades to it all the time, but banks (usually small ones) complain about technology cost of an upgrade.
Banking is a conservative culture in the US. Banks have been planning on implementing European style chip-n-pin system for credit cards for over a decade now, and shops are still refusing to upgrade their point-of-sale devices. Visa have been trying to push a basic password protected system around buying things online for at least 5 years now, and adoption by merchants is fairly low because consumers howl about an extra step in buying something.

The attack would go something like this:
1. I send a transaction to a merchant.
2. I generate a second transaction using the same coins to a puppet address. I do not send this one out.
3. If at anytime between now and when the transaction makes it into the blockchain, I managed to mine a block,  I would insert the transaction to my puppet instead of the real merchant.
If the transactions takes 12 hours to make it into the blockchain, then that is 72 blocks. If I have 1% power, that means that there is a 51% chance that I will be able to mine one of those 72 blocks. At 2% power, it will give me a 77% chance of doing a double spending attack.

Berkshire certainly does have that problem, which is why they simply go to the board and ask to buy stock directly from the company itself (at a discount, no less!) so that the company can get the stock market pop and raise more capital.

Futures for things that are easily stored generally trade at pretty close to the spot price. For example, gold future contracts for Nov is trading at 1208.0, and gold future contracts for Oct is trading at 1207.7. The difference is due to the fact that storing gold isn't quite free, and there is some interest on USD.
(If they are the same price, you can make money by selling gold, buying a futures contract, and dump your money into US government bonds. Wait a month, pay the futures contract, and the interest is free money.)

Its not miners that he need to make this profitable, its users. If every bitcoin transaction uses his service, he would expect to make roughly 4x as much as a fair miner would.

Hell, even in places where the currency is pegged against the dollar, you see people dominating things against the local currency rather then the dollar, and that actually is 100% stability.

Well, if the (non-GHash) miners gets screwed and are forced out of the business, then GHash will eventually control 95+% of the hash power, and mine 100% of the blocks. That means that any transaction that GHash doesn't want to approve wouldn't go though, they can enforce arbitrarily high transaction fees, and they can reverse any transaction they want. In other words, using bitcoin will just be like using paypal. I am not saying that is unworkable, as paypal clearly exist and have a lot of users, but if you are okay with paypal, just use paypal!
For the idea that it will be obvious that they are doing it, all of these pools would be supporting each other. Ideally, they would have such small pools that each one of them would only mine a small handful of blocks, but none of them would extend anything that is not made by the group. Since each only mine a couple of blocks, you can't find a pattern just in the blockchain. 
And remember, extending an old block when you are only behind one is perfectly plausible for anyone with a slow connection, and they can easily write their logic so that they give up when they are behind by two. If they have 51% of the hash rate, they will still get 75-80% of all total returns, and it won't be that long before others are forced out.
As for other solutions existing, none of them are particularly well thought out, and perhaps more importantly, none of them are battle tested in any alt. Remember - all of the alts that had this done to them ended up centralizing or dying.

Boeing issues tons of short term paper today, so obviously the free market isn't policing it. That is part of the problem with a lot of these proposals - people are lazy and they rely on things that usually works. And since Boeing, Verizon, et al. have a pretty spotless record of paying them back, no one really thinks too hard about it. And that isn't just banks - funds where investors are fully exposed to any losses from these companies treat short term bonds from these companies as cash.  
Bank borrowing actually tends to be better in this respect, because no one trust a bank enough to lend it money without asking for collateral, and banks have a lot of assets to hand you for collateral, so you generally only have to trust the collateral in question.
As for not having non-bitcoin denominated commitments, most of life's commits are implicit in nature.

It works by emailing the other person a link. They click it, take them to a page on the bank where they enter their ACH information. The bank then ACH them the money. 
And finally, there is a central payment processor between all US banks - the fed. ACH and fedwire are both maintained by the fed. How do you think checks work if there is no way to transfer money from one bank to another?

If the merchant in question used square, it would have been 2.75%. You get around 1.5% back. (depending on the card) Total in transaction costs would be 1.25% of the transaction, or about 3 cents. Oh, and the seller probably got charged another percent by coinbase/bitpay, bringing the total up to 10 cents for the two of them combined.
Bitcoin works well for a lot of things, but micro-payments sure ain't one of them.

What is to stop you from getting a bunch of bitpay accounts?

Thing is, at that level, they won't have to go though coinbase - they can simply go straight to the exchanges.
As for stability, bitcoin will never be stable enough for them to pay suppliers with it and have it make economic sense. Big companies hate cross-currency exchanges and hedge against them whenever possible, and it is impossible for bitcoin to be stable against the dollar and the Euro at the same time.

ACH is an old creaky system. In theory, if your bank sends your request to the Fed by 2:25am, the Fed will send the money to the other bank at 6am, so you are looking a 4 hour turnaround time, at best, and 28 hours at worst.
In practice, most banks have a 5 PM cutoff for anything sent to the Fed for that night, and the other bank generally won't process it until 9 am. But assuming both banks are reasonably efficient, it is generally a next business day thing. Of course, banks tell you three days so that they have some buffer for both their own and the other bank's systems running slow and making mistakes.

Not quite - costs per GH have been dropping just as quickly. The number to be aware of is miner revenue per day. As long as they can sustain more spending than that (and get the same bang for the buck as the miners), miners will lose. As the mining reward is halving every 4 years, bitcoin will truly have to go to the moon (3000+) for an attack not to be cheaper in 6 years time.

That is still contempt of court, and they will quickly see via the blockchain that you did that. So you are going back to jail until you hand over the new keys as well. Keep in mind that there is no limit on how long they can keep in jail for contempt of court.
Not to mention that they can simply order the tumbler service to hand over the records for the new public keys. If they refuse, they can simply throw them in jail too.
And of course, once you start accessing the money again when you are out of court, that is perjury for telling the justice system that you lost access to the coins. Once again, they can just throw you back into jail.

If bitcoin actually had an attacker with deep pockets that is interested in bringing down the network, it would already be down.
Remember, most of these ASIC bitcoin companies are fairly small startups with tiny budgets (HashFast is probably the best example). Someone with a serious budget (1B+) can get a proper hardware team, send the designs to fabs, and start cranking out tons of chips. Miners paying retail markups along the entire way will never be able to catch up.
Or they can just do a massive DDOS attack on the remaining nodes. At a few thousand nodes, a good old fashioned EC2 based attack might be good enough to bring them all down.

I am not sure how much SWIFT cost. But I know how much ACH costs: 0.0017 cents. (Most banks round it to zero, but if you are doing millions of them, they probably won't be too happy and will start charging you for it.)
From what I can find, SWIFT via SEPA in European countries is free, I can be wrong about that. In any event, ACH is still pretty cheap.
By comparison, the ~5 cents for Bitcoin is pretty high. Running a centralized server paypal style cost roughly as much as a running a full bitcoin node, assuming similar transactions per second.

I think the metric to optimize for is the ratio of attacker resources to "people playing by the rules" resources that needs to exist for an attacker to win.
In a GPU dominated world, the attacker will have to spend way more then the miners, as much of the GPUs would have been brought anyway to play battlefield 4.
In a FPGA dominated world, the ratio will be about 1 - everyone buys the same FPGAs, and everyone gets the same hashrate per dollar.
In an ASIC dominated world, the attacker will have to spend a lot less then everyone else, because he only have to hire one set of ASIC engineers (vs a ton of different competing groups), get chips at fab prices instead of a retail markup, and all of the losses due to shipping and marketing ASIC chips.
CPU only would be best, as nearly everyone have computers anyway, but that will be a hard POW to design.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:28:02
The government only have to spend more then the miners. The miners who only have a very limited income stream - 4000 btc a day today, and 500 btc a day in 10 years. Remember also that as soon as this attack starts, the network will quickly grind into a halt as the network is being hard forked every other minute. How much money are you expecting for the miners to invest with no money coming in the door?
The US government will almost certainly have better ways to handle bitcoin then this particular attack. For a small country though, this might be the best way to shut down bitcoin. And there are certainly enough small dictators threatened by bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:40:56
Then you perform another 51% attack. Remember, you only have to spend as much as the folks who are playing by the rules. As long as the attacker have access to more funds then the miners, they can keep this game going for as long as they want.

If you think governments can't seize bitcoin, you are not thinking hard enough about what governments can do. Remember, governments are by definition the entities that have access to using physical force to compel people to do things.
You certainly can defy a court order to transfer the coins if you want to, but the judge can also throw you in jail until you do. Even if you are beyond the reach of any government (say, if you fled to Cuba or something), courts can easily order the likes of coinbase to not process any of your coins.

The first 51% attack is expensive. The rest will be dirt cheap (or more likely, just reconfiguring a bunch of GPUs). The first attack would require the attacker to buy more ASIC miners then the real miners combined. The second attack would require the same, except that the miners would be wiped out from the first attack as well, and also be forced to start over. As the miners won't be able to get billions of ASICs for the second proof of work overnight, overpowering the second proof of work will be much, much easier. In the long run, we would expect it to be bound by the new coin creation rate, which really isn't all that much money.
Again, there is a reason why I keep saying "attacker" not "government". I am simply laying out a way for someone to attack the network and bring it down.

The most powerful attack would be to go after the exchanges. If they can do a few million dollars of trades on each exchange and roll it back, the exchanges would be facing a good old fashioned bankrun and probably crash bitcoin badly in the process.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:00:36
The cost would remain quite small, actually. Whatever new proof-of-work they switch to would presumably render the attacker's ASICs worthless, but they would also render the miners' ASICs worthless as well. And whatever the miners buy to mine in the future, the attacker could also buy. As long as the attacker spends more then the miners, he will win. And as the miners are faced with very limited incomes (in 10 years, this will be 500 BTC or so a day), any government will be able to pay this amount continuously without anyone really noticing.
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:01:41

In some sense, this is a poor argument - competition also exist for credit cards, and while competition tends to drive the processing costs down, it didn't quite drive it down to zero.
Even if competition doesn't exist on the merchant side, it certainly exist on the consumer side. If the merchant pays out 1.9% and I get 1.5% back, then the actual transaction cost is 0.4%, not 1.9%.

It isn't contractually obligated to buy fuel for the planes, but if it can't buy fuel for the planes, it will default on everything else in pretty short order. Similarly, Google can lay off all of its employees, so at some level, that is not contractual either, but at some other level, I wouldn't expect the site to stay up very long after it did that.

There are two systems in the US. Wire cost $15* to the consumer (it cost the bank around 13 cents) and is instant. ACH is free* to the consumer (it cost the bank around 0.0025 cents) and is a service that is usually overnight, but can take 3 days if you are unlucky.
Needless to say, people go well out of their way to avoid wiring and mainly use ACH.
*Obviously, the banks can charge what they want for both services, but both prices I gave you is what the big banks will charge normal people.

You are still looking at replicating paypal while doing more work. We went from this:
1. I ACH dollars to paypal. 
2. Paypal use SWIFT to send Euros to merchant.
To this:
1. I ACH dollars to coinbase-US. 
2. Coinbase-US buys bitcoin. 
3. Coinbase-US sends bitcoin to Coinbase-EU.
4. Coinbase-EU sells bitcoin.
5. Coinbase-EU pays merchant via SWIFT.
The amount of work that the bitcoin based company does is still more then what Paypal does. So in order to charge less fees then paypal, they have to make far less in profits then paypal does today. This is obviously possible because paypal is pretty profitable, but at that point, it is probably easier to build a service that is kind of like paypal, but charge the same fees as the bitcoin based services. It will be more profitable because it is doing less work. As you noted yourself, the spread between dollars and Euros, and by extension, paypal's costs, are puny.

If you are going to trust a third party, just use paypal. Alternate blockchains suffer the same problem, because the bitcoin hashpower won't be visible until the next block, by which time this attack would have already happened.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:40:15
The steps are not the problem - fees are. Steps can be invisible to the user, but each step adds extra costs, and lots of them. And in any event, if the only value that the blockchain provides is a clearing service, there are much cheaper clearinghouses available.
Remember, the service you talked about can be easily implemented cheaper without bitcoin using two businesses:
1. I ACH money to Square-US.
2. Square-US ACH money to Paypal-Kenya.
3. Paypal-Kenya pays the merchant.
The only thing that our Paypal-Kenya needs to access the US ACH network is a US based bank account. If that is unacceptable for some reason, we can use SWIFT and European bank accounts. And remember, ACH is much cheaper then the blockchain, and USD-&gt;whatever spreads are generally much, much smaller then Bitcoin-&gt;whatever spreads.

The existence doesn't really matter - Lets say that in 2018, someone (you may not even know who) carries out a massive attack and destroys bitcoin. Would you sink a ton of money into scrypt ASICS in the year 2019 onwards? Probably not. And so, the attacker simply waits 4 years for the rewards to drop (causing miners to drop out) and for Moores law to drive his own costs down, and destroy Litecoin for pennies on the dollar.
And if Bitcoin and Litecoin both went down, how hard would it be for people to trust a third one?

Existing volatility from the dollar to the Euro is already scary enough for CFOs, and they do their best to hedge against it when they can.


The dollar is stable as far as a business's liabilities are in dollars - a company knows exactly and precisely how much payroll is next week, in dollar terms. This won't change even if the dollar loses 10% of its value the next week, as payroll requirements will fall against it. A free-floating bitcoin will never achieve that kind of stability.

Adoption needs to be a lot higher for a 51% attack to be out of the reach of any of the major world governments. in 10 years, new coin creation would be down to about 500 coins a day. As the miners as a group are all being paid from this, that is the bar to beat in order to build a bigger ASIC mining pool. How much would a coin have to be worth in order to deter someone with the resources of China or Russia? Well, at $100K a coin, that is $50 million a day. That isn't quite pocket change for them, but still well within their existing budgets.
To make matters somewhat worse, every 4 years the new coin creation rate falls some more. In 22 years, 60 BTC a day is all an attacker have to come up with to bring down the network. That is in the range where someone might plausibly bring down bitcoin simply for personal gain - just short it first! Ditto for in 38 years, where you would need 4 BTC a day.
And the motivation might come in all kinds of forms. Maybe the Russians decide that bitcoin is an effective way around their capital controls and they are not a fan. That can happen at any adoption rate for bitcoin. Maybe a terrorist strike happens in the US that was funded by Bitcoin. Well, you get the idea.

The argument is more along the lines of "Bitcoin's defenses are kind of like a bike lock - pretty good defense for most things, but if someone who is truly determined come after you, you are pretty much fucked". And no matter how you design the system, all POW systems will suffer from the same flaws.
At some level, POW says "he with the most chips win", which translates pretty directly to "he who with the most amount of money to spend will win". Bitcoin does suffer a bit in this respect because using ASICs means that money isn't linear - spending 10x more then the next guy will get you way more then 10x more hashes. But there isn't anything you can actually do to stop the bad guys if they have a deep enough pocket.

Assuming that the merchant also cashes out, you just described paypal with an extra step in the middle.
Paypal - ACH money from me to Paypal, Paypal ACH money to merchant.
Circle - ACH money from me to circle. Circle buys bitcoin. Circle sells bitcoin. Circle ACH money to merchant.
The only way that this will save anyone any money is if Circle is willing to make a lot less profits then paypal (possible). But if they are willing to do that, just charge less fees without the middle step.

While all of that is true, at that point, you are simply better off with checks. As you are effectively dealing with transactions that can be reversed easily while counting on law enforcement to punish those who double spend. Besides, it will be easier to explain to a DA that someone is writing bad checks rather then performing double spend attacks on bitcoin.
For online, 12 hours means that buying things overnight is simply out of the question, and even 2 day shipping will be considerably more expensive from the merchant side. In world where people are trying to compete with Amazon prime, it would render bitcoin a terrible option.
As another aside, if we think the impact on the market from this move is small, then it becomes a (nearly) riskless attack on bitcoin - even if things go badly, you still get normal miners fees, but if things go well, you get a decent chunk of transaction costs.

To put it into perspective, ACH cost $0.0025. (That is how much the Fed charges the bank, and the bank generally provide the service for free) FedWire costs 13.8 cents. Banks do charge steep premiums for wiring money though, so YMMV on that one when it comes to retail costs. This is of course why dwolla can offer instant payment for 25 cents per transaction.
Hell, processing credit cards through Amazon payments cost 5 cents + 5% (or .30+1.9%, whichever is lower), which means that bitcoin is barely cheaper than credit cards for micropayments.
In short, 10 cents per transaction is actually fairly steep in the word of payments. The big advantage isn't in cost (ACH is basically free, for all practical intents and purposes), speed and convenience (credit cards is pretty fast), but simply that you can't reverse it and that it is faster than ACH while being cheaper than credit cards or fedwire.

So we are back to evaluating borrower's cash flow and creditworthiness instead of just checking how much money is in the vault? That is a long way to work back to the system for corporate bonds as they exist right now.


Maybe. I mean, they came back after the great depression 09, and a bunch of other times where they lost a ton. But a giant mega run on the bond market will wipe out most businesses, and any solution that involves in having the industrial base of a country wiped clean every generation or so sounds worse then just having the fed around, to be honest.

One key idea is the so called "colored coins", where we assign real world ownership of something to a very specific unit of bitcoin. Lets use an example:
Lets say that the bank is holding a bar for gold for you, but you want to trade it. It is extremely annoying to take the bar of gold out of the vault, give it to someone else, and then have that someone else put it back into the vault. So what we are really looking for is a way for you tell the bank, "this bar really belong to the other guy now". You can call the bank, of course, but that is annoying for the bank, and the two of you have to do a lot of work to verify that this really happened. So what the bank can do instead, is to give you a particular Satoshi, and tells you "the guy who hold this Satoshi is the rightful owner of this bar of gold". So you can go ahead of give that Satoshi to anyone you want, and the bank don't have to care until that person eventually goes and redeems, and it is all provably secure.

For most real world applications, mining isn't required. Mining is only required if you want a trustless system.

In a properly function futures market, the contract is marked to market.

Of course it is possible to peg a crypto currency to the dollar. Chase can easily* issue a coin that is completely pegged to the dollar. It would be different from bitcoin in 2 simple ways:
1. No one is allowed to publish blocks other than Chase itself.
2. Each block would issue a variable number of coins.
Chase can say that "Anyone can exchange these coins for account balances at Chase" and that "Anyone can exchange account balances at Chase for these coins".
With these simple changes, we would have a coin that is 100% pegged to the dollar (or whatever the bank wants to peg it to), and is useful in the most of the ways that crypto currencies are useful for.

Because ACH is designed to work from one bank to another, and not from one person to another. If I have enough information to send money via ACH to you, I also have enough information to take money via ACH from you. Needless to say, people don't really like the idea of handing out ACH information to other people.
Instead, the model that developed in the US is like this:
1. I ACH money to an institution that I trust. (Paypal, coinbase, Google wallet, etc)
2. I send a message via Paypal to my friend.
3. He gives his ACH information to paypal.
4. Paypal gives him the money.
Some banks work around it like this:
1. I tell the bank "email this person money".
2. The bank emails the other guy, and asking for his ACH info.
3. The bank collects his ACH info, and then sends him the money.

Well, you still get a quick sharp run on the short term bond market, which will probably bleed over into every part of the bond market in a hurry. And of course, you can't stop real businesses from doing the maturity transformation - if Boeing issues a bunch of a short term notes and expect to roll them over endlessly,it is very hard for an outsider to be able to tell whether Boeing just wants borrow short term in between when an aircraft is delivered and when a check for the plane actually arrived. Similarly, you can't prevent individuals from doing the same. Well, I guess you can, but that is going to require armies and armies of regulators.
It is the same as the people who rely on bitcoin for all of their spending - they are counting on the liquidity of the bitcoin market even though the price would collapse very quickly if say, 5% of the bitcoin market wants to cash out into a national currency in the next 24 hours. You can say that it doesn't damage anything and these people are all idiots, but well, a lot of people are idiots.

No one borrows or lends bitcoin, so it is kind of a moot point. We can talk about it working when it actually happens. And frankly, cryptographic proof of reserves is all kind of meaningless when you are borrowing to buy real goods anyways. What is the cryptographic proof of reserves even mean when it is United borrowing to buy planes? Or when Consolidated Edison wants to borrow money to build a power plant? It means something in a bitcoin exchange, but at some point, you need other businesses to exist in the economy. You can crow about it when someone actually comes up with a working model for funding real businesses.
You may also want to look at the history of the banking crashes. In most of them before the 20th century, no one was bailed out. Did this mean that people stopped trusting banks with maturity transformation? Hahahaha, no. It kept happening over and over again.
A good old fashioned deflationary crash would still wipe out long term bond holders (prices of planes and power plants fall. Debts don't.), so I would rather be a short term bond holder for GE then long term, so in practice there is no force stopping the likes of GE from engaging in maturity transformation. In fact, this is the effect that allowed GE to build an extremely large financial branch, same for Siemens in Germany.

Wait, so you can only borrow with non-recourse loans if you are borrowing to buy real goods? Otherwise, I am more interested in a borrower's ability to pay me back rather then what he have in his vault, as if any other part of the borrower's business goes badly, I will be impacted too.


Well, they don't. But they do allow redemption at any time, and that was enough to trigger a huge run in the bond market in 09.

Won't work. Random errors would quickly be rejected as errors, because the hashes wouldn't match. Changing previous transactions have the same problem.
If the majority of the full nodes was running an evil version, it still won't be too useful to you unless if you can compromise the client that the users are using in the wild. The only attack this will you allow you perform is to refuse to propagate certain transactions, therefore carrying out double spends on 0-confirm transactions. Otherwise, other clients would either think that you are sending them bad blocks, or else the hash rate on your network is suspiciously low.

Oh, I do agree that bitcoin as a payment system have potential - 10 cents is a fair amount cheaper then .30+1.9%-1%*. The 1% at the end accounts for cashback that the buyer gets. But I was arguing that it won't win on price alone - if that is the case, we would buy everything via ACH, as it is so much cheaper.

Yeah, but for most well respected people, it will cause the price to rise, which is good if you are invested in it.

It depends on the bank, but you can usually send money if you have the other person's ACH details. Some banks allow you to send money if you just have the other person's email. The other person will have to provide the bank with ACH information, and then the bank will ACH him the money. 
It is all works fairly well if you are paying a brother, but with the way that ACH is designed, if you have enough information to put money into someone's account, you also have enough information to take money out of someone's account.

What would the audit return? "There is a plane worth $X, and they are borrowing less then $X"? If you can use a plane to borrow, why not a mortgage?


That does not really conform to how events happened in the real world. In the real world, people prompted decided that banks were too safe and didn't yield enough, and piled into money market accounts instead. Market market funds stated upfront that there is ZERO dollars in the vault, and people piled into them anyways.

That assumes that there are enough independent miners to pay for R&amp;D. The big player might run the R&amp;D operation as well, and beyond a certain marketshare, he have no incentives to actually sell miners instead of just mining himself.

Not in this case. Blocks smaller than 1 mb will continue to be valid blocks. If 51% of all miners refused to recognize any bigger blocks, then those bigger blocks will all be orphaned by the way that bitcoin works.

Right now, the usage case for bitcoin payments looks something like this:
1. The sender send money (in the local currency) to Coinbase
2. Coinbase ACH money to the send money (in local currency) to the recipient.
There is some messing around with bitcoin in the middle, but that is all kind of superfluous, with those 2 steps in the middle being the key that people really cares about. Remember, that is all Paypal is, and paypal is worth quite a bit more than Coinbase. If Coinbase can build the rest of the network (and that is what they said they will do with the money), the bitcoin step in the middle quickly becomes moot.

Money market funds are not zero term demand deposits. They are technically a share in a pool of longer term investments that is allowed to lose money if the value of those longer term investments fall. However, they were liquid enough that people treated them as demand deposits, and when that expectation fell though, bad things happened.
The only thing you need for bad things to happen is for people to treat liquid long term assets as short term assets. I don't think it matters a whole lot whether it is explicit (money market funds) or implicit (bank deposits).

If the miners have majority hash power, they can  simply publish empty blocks on the classic fork that ignore all other blocks.

With how bitcoin currently works, the longest chain wins. With 51%, the odds that you will have the longer chain within a day if you ignore everyone else is over 99%.


If you have 52%, you can leave 1% on mining the new chain to keep it functional and use 51% to make sure that everyone abandon the old chain.
Mining isn't cheap, so the remaining miners on the old chain will be forced to stop relatively quickly with no income.

Step 5: Bob's arbitrage bot shorts.
Step 6: Trade between your alts to boost the price up until Bob's arbitrage bot runs out of money and is margin called. Force Bob's arbitrage bot to buy at $1000 a coin to cover the short.
Step 7: Enjoy your new million bucks and new Lambo.

Well, it won't be accepted by the other full nodes who follow the old rules. Some full nodes will upgrade, because they are controlled by the fraudulent miners.
The full nodes can indeed run their own branch independent of the fork of the miners, but the miners can shut down the old branch via a 51% denial of service attack where they only publish and only allow empty blocks to be published. Without mining power, the full nodes can do nothing about it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:54:38
You can credible threat to publish empty blocks until the rest of time and ignore any non-empty blocks.
No one will ever move a coin without our attacker's permission.

I was thinking that you would combine the hard fork with a DOS attack on the original fork to force everyone onto your fork. Everyone would want to come onto your fork because they want to do things with their coins at some point.
51% of hash power allows you to ignore all other miners and publish empty blocks until the end of time.

Running a full node does allow you to be a passive observer, but you only need a single honest person to do that. When that honest person reports the issue, the rest of the community can download the blocks and see for themselves.
More importantly, in the age of Bitcoin futures, assuming miners always have an interest in bitcoin's long term success is dubious. A group of miners can always short bitcoin to the tune of a few hundred million to billions first before doing anything.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:44:49
Miners can 51% any fork they don’t like, so there is only the option to use what the miners want to do.

In theory, if the price drop hard enough for enough miners to drop out, there might not ever be another difficulty adjustment ever again.
That might be a fun number to work out. Probably below $1,000. If I had to guess, $100 or so within the next few days might do it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:47:01
They will mine 10% of the blocks. But if 90% of the miners are dirty, they can have 79% of the hash power mine on the new fork, and 11% on the old fork. The 11% will only publish empty blocks and ignore any miner that isn't part of their group.
The 10% of legit miners will have all of their blocks orphaned and no longer be getting any revenue. No one on the classic fork will be able to move any coins.
The ability to pull this off is solely via mining power, non mining nodes have no ability to influence anything.
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:02:39

That may be the purpose of a blockchain to you, but there are other upsides. For one thing, if a hacker got a hold of a SQL database for a few hours, they can some real damage. If they got a hold of the only machine that is allowed to generate new blocks, the damage they can do is very limited.
There are other upsides, like being able to verify the other side have the money to pay you as of the last block. I am sure merchants would rather not have to deal with bouncing checks anymore. You can also implement things like escrow much more easily.
None of these things requires a decentralized system rather than a system that says "All blocks signed by central entity is valid, and all other blocks is rejected". Viola, no 51% attacks. If you want to make it safer from hackers, you can have a consensus based system based on a vote from each of the major banks. The hacker would have to break into all major banks.
As for being able to deny transactions and being able to create money at well, I doubt you will be able to convince the banking industry that those are bad things.
