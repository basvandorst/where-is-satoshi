It’s not about people who buy them..why are they there in the first place while they are banned everywhere else, except ‘they’ make the lottery?
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:59:21
What are state run lotteries then?

For those not strong on math—- the 90% loss thing is even worse.
For that you need a 1000% return to get back to even.

You need to send them 5 btc they’ll send back 45btc. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:22:09

They’ve already been bribed by Roger Ver to keep the orange colour. Not even kidding. CMC has the power.

I bought it from some new random site and some people said they could double spend it.
I could care less if that was a transfer between 2 addresses that I owned.
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:39:24
Okay, I saw this service
 push tx.btc.com
For a few they can bump the transaction
Anyone tried and worked?
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:48:47
edit : USED     PAID $20 AND I GOT 1 CONFIRMATION WITHIN 17-20 MINS, i was afraid so i used $20 , something new I learnt thanks everyone!
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:04:45
thats okay, I already factored this in before sending, it was a big amount(for me) and a website I used for the first time, so better waste $20 than lose the entire amount. If I was a big player I wouldnt care..
