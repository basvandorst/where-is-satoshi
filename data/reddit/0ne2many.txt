I'm 17, I get 6 euros an hour (about $8) I worked my ass of last year and just a week ago when the price was below 10.000$ I spent 90% of my money to buy half a bitcoin. Best decision of my life

Totally.

True, at this moment bitcoin is unkillable.

There will always be people willing to buy. Bitcoin is unstoppable now

Each bitcoin market has their own price for buying and selling. The price can vary from market to market because the demand, the currency and the profit rates vary from market to market. At 17k bitcoin is still "cheap" relative to it's potential. I say it's a buy

Maybe they don't want your bitcoins, just to but enough bitcoins themselves to cover up a huge enough percentage of the total market cap and decide to sell it all at a specified time so the price will decline dramatically, causing all others to FUD and starting a chain event in wich all scared people sell their coins, rendering bitcoins next to valueless.
