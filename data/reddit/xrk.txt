If you didn't have friends to live off how are you supposed to survive being locked to the US and no right to work? Is this some kind of forced incentive to break the law out of desperation for food and water so they can cuff you or something?

well, i mean, you gave your money to the bank. it's a privilege for you to withdraw any amount at all!

growing up in the 90ies being called a hypocrite was one of the greatest insults. today, it's expected.

considering how many votes the racist party got i'd say it's a pretty serious opinion.

what liars? we're americanizing our laws and strategically importing an underclass otherwise called 'uneducated workers'. out of 10 million people 3 million are first, second, and third generation immigrants.

I bought in essentially because every single person I know into BTC have told me over the past 3 years that I should. It's basically been going up ever since they started telling me to. Proving me wrong about my argument that it's a bad investment. Until now that I've actually invested. That is.

It's such an ironic quote too. Sweden has run its politics by that philosophy for nearly 100 years until around 15 years ago when the neoliberal party was elected to lead, and since then we've changed to Milton Friedman's economics model, which has more or less gives corporations and wealthy individuals all power; making life difficult for the rest of us.

After arguing bitcoin isn't worth buying into because it's just too volatile, for years, I finally did when they were worth 10k and still going up...
Well, just like three months later, I'm sitting here, with awful losses.
Hate being proven right. Still waiting to be proven wrong.

cryptocurrency is a great idea that can officiate and push globalization and decentralization of value, shifting it away from control within banks, the rich and governments to you, the individual. but, as it only holds value as long as people give it value, the way our world works, there will 'probably' never be enough room for more than one mainstream cryptocurrency to control the markets and be greenlit as a legitimate currency by both population and governments the world over. so what all these "shitcoins" are basically doing right now is hindering the progress and being used as tools for scams by those who control them, who are fully aware of this and exploit the suckers who buy into it for short term profits.
as a parallel example that; there is only one World of Warcraft, but hundreds of failed clones. Lot's kept chanting "this will be the wow killer!" for each new clone, but it never happened because that's not how actual, real, people, think or behave.
there can only be one. we have that one. so let the shitcoins die. don't let the scammers and political self interest disrupt progress.
