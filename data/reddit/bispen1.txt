I have to accounts on my hardware, legacy and I can’t remember the second. One of them uses ln the other one doesn’t.
Can I do something to support ln?

Can someone explain why the transaction fee is so high?
How will that change?

So I have to send my stack from the one account which not has ln to the account that does on my hardware?
Thanks for answering.

Don’t ever use money that you need! But I wouldn’t worry. It’ll go up again. This is just a small dip.
Buy and then hold for some years!
