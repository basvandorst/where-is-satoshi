Put us on the list as well please. AllArk.com
We are a general marketplace where anyone can buy or sell anything including BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:57:06
If you look at our history you will realize we contribute plenty, and there are plenty of people who are looking for what we offer as well.
Calling us one or the other based on a day or two of posting is unfortunate on your end. We get what you're saying but to go through the effort of being this frustrated seems ridiculous. If you're that unconcerned just ignore.
Sorry for trying . Jeez.
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:53:28
Exactly: today you can buy loads of things with BTC, some of the top ones are in the thread here

Maybe the fact that your Bitcoin networth is not as in your face as his fiat net worth gives him that smirk.
Drive up in a spanking new car and watch him drown in sorrow.
But that would have to mean not HODLing so there's that.
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:15:30
That is true,
We have done a lot of research and are continually doing more in this area. We already have a marketplace with a few transactions, sellers who use it buyers who use it.
Our marketplace itself is easy to use but we are actively looking to incorporate BTC as a form of payment in our marketplace, we are sure that our sellers will accept it and our buyers would welcome it. The only difference in introducing BTC in our marketplace is that instead of Euros or Dollars the transaction happens in BTC, the shipping, feedback and everything else is already set up, works flawlessly and remains the same.
We haven't thought of becoming a marketplace for BTC itself as it has never crossed our mind, plus that would require more sellers and buyers interested in trading it than anything on our end, on our end, we have had a few sellers sell BTC and Zero issues with it. We are happy to support things that sellers wish to sell and buyers wish to buy.
We are just impressed by the ease of simplicity in BTC transactions and as a marketplace it just seems like a no brainer.
Edit: We've been talking about it without any info on ourselves, we are AllArk.com (And we support BTC)
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:40:03
Sounds legit.

Ah just google AllArk.com
If we post too many links, we get warnings. :P
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:42:08
Ha ha, we just meant our marketplace promotes Sellers to adopt Bitcoin heavily, didn't wanna come off as promoting. And yes, we are a hybrid between Craigslist And Amazon in that you can deal locally if you want or post requests if you like without a 1000 step process. The difference is, every individual gets feedback for transactions unlike Craigslist.
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:40:47
We're more like a new marketplace,
Our implementation is a specific flavor of a broad solution. We're trying to rope in already existing sellers who are sick pf eBay or Amazon by offering lower fees and we also want to invite and look for people and merchants who want to trade in BTC so we are constantly trying to reach out.
But your own experiences are eye opening it seems that a personal touch works wonders. It is truly amazing to hear that you can live on BTC alone.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:32:32
Bitcoin version of Amazon.... yay Us! xD
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:00:49
Thank you so much for the detailed response. 
We are also trying to find people to make our own in house system, it seems the personal touch and communication between people has helped you tremendously. Being a small town must also have helped, as bic cities do not have these kind of trustworthy relationships.
Your efforts are laudable.

Accepting Bitcoin is the easy part.
Implementing Blockchain itself opens up more possibilities, many startups do bandy it around and maybe it's their whole premise, but what if already established startups are looking to move over to it.
Carrying out transactions on a BC backbone is magnitudes more efficient than the current mess of payment processors, banks, regulators etc. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:49:03
Businesses can stop paying payment processors to confirm and process transactions. Isn't that obvious. Or do you not have any idea how much businesses pay in transaction fees.
Investment Banks alone can save up to $12 billion annually by moving to Blockchain. Not being short, but do you have any suggestions or just doubts. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:31:40
Buy them via Bank Deposit and the 1000 other options.

How would a decentralized exchange work..now that's something worth considering. A central point to buy and sell does not need a central point to verify transactions, maybe a shared network like...i don't know...BITCOIN ??
And alts are going up, this is the time to buy them, but if you believe that exchanges are blameless, i got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya.

Your first line shows you haven't even done your homework as we've had conversations on reddit, contributed to various forums and signups from people who are genuinely interested.
Guess your own thread is making you look disingenuous. If you were really interested in finding ways to use BTC, you wouldn't resort to child like tantrums everytime someone else came up with solutions you did not like, and thanks for reporting our coherent and point-of-fact responses as spam, good luck with buying your house. We really don't think you are going to lend anything else constructive to this discussion what with your hubris of starting a "thread on reddit"

Update : Just look at the upward graph of Bitcoin pricing, it's a commodity bubble if there ever was one. It is basically a commodity right now, specially when you can make more money trading it than using it.
Sure it's deflationary but people don't care, and they pump more and more money into it.
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:26:57

We aren't based on OpenBazaar. We are a marketplace that supports Bitcoin and is trying to give users an option to purchase or sell using BTC as a method without having to download a desktop application.
Does that answer the question?
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:54:57
You can use it with us!
We are super excited about BTC since we started accepting it a few weeks ago and are just on a mad spree trying to get all the news about it.

The IRS can demand anyone's books, it's called an Audit. If you are money laundering, the audit is gonna find out. So, not really a good example. Circle can get audited, but their financial records are following regulations, their user's financial records are not theirs' to disclose unless otherwise stated in EULA
In cases of money laundering, they will not charge you with request for information, they will directly file criminal prosecution charges.
You can only shut down if you have followed all rules and regulations but the request for information is something you are not comfortable with. It is a "request" not a regulation.
Extrapolate as necessary

Below a certain dollar amount, yes, there are better options, that's why it is repeatedly stressed, to make the investment worthwhile, the dollar amount has to be high enough. 
As to being "mad" : No , i was brought up to be respectful and smack down those who do not extend me the same courtesy. If that doesn't jive, then tough.
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:58:16
Bitcoin just went from 12 Billion to 13 Billion + in less than 18 days if you look at the comment explaining it.
It's like clockwork, there are people making millions of dollars as you read this, and most of them are in China.
If it ever does become a currency, it will be like tiny minuscule amounts of gold dust being exchanged for goods.
What is the reason for the upswing? You could say chinese market fears, Trump presidency yada yada yada... but if we cut the bullshit it is simply. People are pumping the bubble to make money, once they decide to pop it like a zit, BTC rep will take a hit..again.
That's it, enjoy while it lasts. Ideally now would be the time to buy stuff with Bitcoin that will hold value so that when it crashes (not a fault with BTC but due to the market inflating actors) you will come out a winner.
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:08:12
Firstly, before we address your points: Are you calling us "short sighted idiots" ? We just want to clarify if we are dealing with insults or facts.
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:33:24
Straw man. 
Always knew your questioning would lead to this, if you are that concerned and brilliant figure it out. BTC isn't synonymous with freeloaders.
And if you do not get the gist of "above a certain amount" you never will.
Plus, you honestly expect people in business to let you in on trade deals, even in small amounts, to prove themselves right on reddit? Armchair general much? That's not how it works sweetie.
Have a nice day
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:25:32
NO surprise there if you have been following the hyper inflation initiated by the socialist president there.
They devalue money then just reprint more money while taking the zeros off so $10000 becomes $1 in new money and everybody runs around like headless chickens lol
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:54:01
Dealing with regulations on a daily basis, we feel that what might have happened is they got a broad-reaching request from the government to hand over their user's data and they refused.
Only way left for them was to shut down.

Hey there,
We are AllArk.com
We just made an account today as we are a newly launched Peer to Peer Marketplace with a few users who educated us about the value of Bitcoin.
Some of our sellers are selling iPhones Game consoles for BTC, some are selling actual BTC.
We also noticed that there are some extremely good wallets like Trezor to store BTC but ironically, no one can BUY these BTC wallets for BTC , so we added that too.
This would be a shameless plug, but we just joined reddit as we see a great community of extremely sharp people here and wanted to see if there would be interest.

We actually feel inflation is one of the worst tenets of modern economics. Gold price is a great example. 
But assuming your analysis is correct then wouldn't it limit BTC as Central Banks will outlaw or make it extremely unprofitable to exchange fiat to BTC. 
Because Central Banks -&gt; money -&gt; trade and commerce are interlinked and something that threatens their captive base (We The Traders) will make them scurry to protect their cash sows (us).

@_date: 2016-12-04 18:09:14
Thank you for that constructive criticism,
We are limited by the platform we are using but we will work on making this more obvious.
Currently, our sellers advertise items where BTC is accepted as "BTC Accepted" in the title, we will encourage them to add language in the item description outlining the discount.
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:19:49
And now you can actually buy stuff with it using LBC's other remittance sections. Big supporter of using BTC as a currency, just not too many opportunities to use it.
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:54:30
And how much money would you need to justify holding for 12 months as an investor NOT A HODLer ... made the distinction extremely clear.
$400 invested in growing your business will yield more returns than holding. 
Read the next statement, holding works only above a certain value now. AGAIN, not talking about your savings, but INVESTING. 
If you told me "Hey gimme $400 in Jan and i'll give you $800 in Dec" I'd tell you to sod-off as an investor, i could do way more with those $400 in 12 months than just double it. 
And if you're too scatterbrained to invest your money, all this will appear as "babbling" to you. Judging from your knee-jerk impolite response, i'd say, yes, you wouldn't know what to do.
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:33:28

List of things you can buy with BTC today, and at a discount, you would be surprised, does that answer your question
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:47:34
Or even useful stuff like cellphones, electronics etc?
We're interested in the mainstream commercial uses, would you say those millions of dollars worth of transactions are for products that would be legally allowed on places like Amazon.
Just curious.
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:56:45
That's another point we see, a recent article in Forbes pointed to the fact that the values that BTC founders prize such as freedom or decentralisation are not the values that most of the miners in china (who make up a good chunk of the mining pool) care about.
If a majority of miners want to use BTC as the next "get rich quick train" then they don't really care about using it as a currency. They want to create and cash out a bubble, further eroding confidence in the basis of BTC..as an alternative to the Central Banking system.
 While those of us who want to facilitate it as a currency are told to "be patient" 
7 years on, it seems that we are at a cusp.
Article attached below:
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:47:11
We understand that,
What the post means to shine a light on is that yes, you are correct, that BTC is all 3 of the above, but don't you think that whatever the reason, it is being treated more as a Commodity and S.O.W. than a currency.
We would be happy to accept BTC, and we would be happy to give discounts as in some ways it helps the business model, but won't market cap growth explode when everyday people see that they can use BTC to buy that little thing they always wanted without all the hassles of chargebacks etc.
Most merchants are too busy processing transactions to devote much time to avenues where they don't see activity, they see it as time = money.
I think merchants who care about reputation (as we do) would love to have BTC as a medium of exchange as it takes away half the worries of conventional banking/chargeback scams.
Wouldn't encouraging adoption (even in small limited ways) help the market cap? Merchants are happy to wait for the transaction to clear as shipping products itself takes 2-3 days.

@_date: 2016-12-23 05:39:49
Incorrect you are arguing the point which we are stating while also being on the same side.
your question itself has your answer. Just check the dollar amount needed to invest in Stock Market Indexes, Housing and Interest from Banks to realize sizable gain.
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:25:14
Thanks for your input,
It seems as if there is at least one individual that is interested, do you think that your peers feel the same way?
We are trying to learn as much as we can about the "WHY" of this particular environment.
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:50:19
That is a good point,
However, most of our sellers that accept BTC, accept it for Electronic items like iPhone, Android-phones, Game consoles, even card games, we are a marketplace and can only advise our sellers on what would encourage BTC consumers to come to them and we figure that is a good target demographic, web hosting is a great demographic as well, but unfortunately none of our current users are selling such services.
We will keep an eye out and invite people who have a product to sell that utilizes existing demand, while also encouraging wider adoption.
When non-tech savvy people start using BTC, that would be a great boost to its powers.
In the end, your observations and analysis is something we hadn't thought of, thank you for them.
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:52:07
For what it's worth we also have sellers selling BTC on our marketplace but we really are disappointed, we had reached out to Circle to ask if we could work on an API on BTC payments and purchases that could be implemented with us, guess that's why they did not reply.
*(Disclaimer: I work for AllArk.com, an online P2P Bitcoin supporting marketplace)*
*Borrowed the above fact to state in our own thread dealing with Circle*
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:30:24
 Best guess : Regulations. When it becomes unprofitable to profit off of being an Exchange, and all your revenue goes to regulations (they adopted bitlicense and regulations are almost always business killers) then it doesn't make sense to keep doing business.
On the face of it they are painting it as "oh we are going to be fiat money transmitters now" using blockchain blah blah but pretty sure they got Fudgepacked by Regulations.

@_date: 2016-12-04 18:00:54
We encourage our sellers to offer a 10% discount on BTC transactions on big ticket items and 15%-20% on smaller ones.
They do have to update these prices manually. But we would be more than happy to press even bigger discounts on our sellers if there would be interest in BTC.

Already posted his phone number and email. What other information would help. let us know. Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:10:28
No problem, here goes
1. Apparently he is loaning to people who need it for a very short time and are unable to get the amounts they need via conventional means, red flags and i told him but he said "I cannot discuss my business plan" but you can try
2. He said he was making slightly less than what I would make, but i wouldn't trust that, they could say they make half, a lot less, more...bottomline is they say you get 20%
3. You are correct, an online simple calculation showed me that with compounding interest he would be a millionaire but when i mentioned this, he said, "I only have limited clients right now who don't borrow much, If i get more money i will get more clients
4. I brought up the borrowing aspect, he said he prefers to deal with BTC as it's faster and a lot less headache than dealing with bank loans and pre-payment penalties, like i said, not your average scammer, only the regulatory aspect had him stuck.
5. I assume most people risk small amounts without asking for collateral, i stopped texting when he wouldn't offer collateral, but then he called and called and was extremely verbose in his experience etc.
I might be wrong and he might be legit but i'm not willing to bet on it at this time.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:16:05
Here you go:
1. They said "The transaction is completed in 8 hours or less", keep in mind these kind of people may use any arbitrary number, they used 8 hours in my case, i am assuming that 8 hours is enough for you to be unable to alert anyone etc.
2. Apparently, they had cash but needed their BTC to add to investors' BTC to lend to other people, I asked them the exact same question.
3. Yup. The amount of time the guy spent explaining and fleshing out his story was impressive to say the least. It was that which really piqued my interest, i would get it if he wanted 0.1 BTC to start (he mentioned he doesn't usually take less than 0.1 BTC but i told him, "I d on't know you and i'm willing to give you $50 if this is a scam because you have been putting forth a shit load of effort" lol)
4. He would give 20% interest, i'm sure it could be higher. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:12:05
Good Question, I am gonna answer this for other people who are risk-takers, which is neither good nor bad, some people just are.
What got my interest piqued was
1. So much effort expended for such a small amount
2. The level of detail invented to act as social proof and tick all the right boxes of what we would call "a normal functioning member of society"
3. The fact that it was a confidence scheme designed to inspire confidence, some people i know would have sent them a whole Bitcoin after the first transaction, without thinking twice.
4. In the past, i have met some genuine people who have become good friends who i met through their solicitations, these people are driven and focused and just need a chance.
5. It is better to lose a little and learn a new scam than lose a lot later
6. I am in a position to give a chance to some people who are genuinely brilliant and desperate for people to see their vision e.g. a very very well known VC passed on airbnb in Angel Investing Round as he thought it was a "stupid idea", he later publicly called it "one of my most foolish decisions". His investment at the current valuation would have added a couple of billion dollars to his net worth at the price of less than a million.
Hope that makes sense. I just have enough crypto that even if i lose some, it benefits the community overall and increases my knowledge, maybe your experience is more extensive but i couldn't find anything about this scam that was detailed or well written out and thus this experience will help those in the future like me who are researching this.

That's true. If there are any LBC mods on here, they could help and I am willing to provide screenshots of conversation.

Useful. This particular scammer never mentioned any website etc. It was a confidence scam with the two layered approach. I think had i had more patience, I would have kept reinvesting $50 until he ran away with it or gave me back $50 in interest and then just sent him the $50 and told him to keep re-investing.
But I wanted to hook the fish to show the true colors, especially since i placed a block on the money deposited.

No offense taken,
Your comment is helpful and insightful

I tried trimming it as much as i could but figured, that the more specifics we could give, the more helpful it would be for people, i always look for red flags and this one was missing quite a few, however hopefully with our documentation of this experience, people will have a great idea of how it works. =)

We saw a Bitcoin Scams sub on here but there are very few contributions, the more such scams are detailed and unearthed the harder it becomes for people to scam and the more confidence grows in BTC.

Do you have specific stories,
We are documenting all major and minor scams. This one was a multi level scam in that they returned the investment until they reached their "Scam Threshold" then bailed....it was a very enlightening experience to say the least.
Surprisingly they also deposited cash etc, so it's like they must be really desperate to go through all that trouble to earn less than working the same time in McDonald's would get them

Read update. Thanks.

No problem,
Even "hardened veterans" may be surprised at how much effort these guys are putting forth. Most people don't realize it is super easy to sit back and read something happened and have 20/20 hindsight but in the real world dealing with live people, social communication plays a huge part.
Just doing my part =)

Your Father sounds like a wise Man.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:13:28
Exactly what i did but then he called again and again and was persistent AND POLITE. 
New kind of scammer. Lesson learnt. Move on.

I did not see that post but it definitely sounds like something that works on the two things people like, Insane returns and minimal effort, my way of making sure to avoid losses is asking for collateral, which makes 99% of scammers go away.

Great.
