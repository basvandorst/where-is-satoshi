Most of the donations were made during a trend of falling values vs. USD, though that trend has now reversed.  The inflationary or deflationary effects aren't really being felt now, it's mostly speculative trends that drive the price, more than the fundamentals.
I merely stated what the donations are worth now.  Though it's possible, as you point out, to determine the USD equivalency at the time of donation, that was too much work for a simple reddit post, and it won't differ by more than a factor of 2 from the current value as the donations were made in the past couple of months.

A year ago, all bitcoins in existence were worth $1.25M (5M coins at $0.25 each), not enough to support much of any service since 90%+ of them aren't on the market.  Then once coins started being worth something in June, and able to support actual trade, software development started.  And as you might guess, it just takes time to write good software for financial applications like e-cart plugins.  So, no, there's not a lot visibly going on, but as soon as some good e-cart plugins come out, I think it will take off.  Last time I looked -- which was about two months ago -- all the bitcoin e-cart solutions I looked at sucked donkey balls.

I think Zhou said that they lost 20% of all their bitcoins in the hack, where the online wallet was compromised.  The offline wallet was still intact, from my understanding, and so they should be adding up all their claims, divide by what they have, and pay out at least a percentage of all claims.  I'd expect that you would get at least 50% back, perhaps even 90% or 100%, but it'll be a while until they close the claims process and do the divvying up.
Take what I say with a grain of salt, though, as I've only been skimming the bitcointalk forum this year since the hack.

Kind of like how some checks read, "Two signatures needed if amount is greater than $5,000", this is the ability to require that two signatures are required to approve a transaction.  This could have avoided the recent Linode debacle if one system had been running as a Linode VPN, and the other on a different VPN provider: the chances of both systems being compromised simultaneously is much lower than of just one system being compromised.

Much stupider amounts of money were made by seemingly everyone that just happened to be working in tech at the start of the dot com era, with thousands of millionaires and many billionaires.  Bitcoin's total market cap, $24M, is really not that much by comparison, and could only create a couple of millionaires.
Perhaps this is your first brush with a "what if" at success? A number of my friends rejected dot com jobs, thinking, "Nah, *that's* not going anywhere.", and missed out on being multi-millionaire.  It was a risk, and some took it and won, some took it didn't.
There's still a chance (a low one, I think) that bitcoin goes to $1000. It's more likely that it goes to $0.  What are you willing to risk on the offchance it goes to $1000?  It may not be in infant stage anymore, but bitcoin isn't much more than a toddler, and it's not too late.

You're seriously stretching. Even if a solar flare wiped out every single power plant in the world, people still need a place to sleep at night. Bitcoin, as novel and interesting as it is, isn't needed for the world to function, and is more likely to drop to 0%. It's not "highly unlikely" everyone will wake up tomorrow and decide that all real estate is worthless, that's just silly, like saying "who knows, the sun might not rise tomorrow". 
I know a lot about gypsum. It's so cheap there's nothing in there except gypsum and paper.  But even if your cancer hypothesis is true, in older places, there are numerous pre-drywall lathe and plaster houses, as well as many office buildings made of concrete.

There are many methods of coercion that don't involve jail time. 
The IRS is pretty darn good at collecting money. Ever heard of a lien? If there's no money in bank accounts to seize, no wages to garnish, then they'll put the lien against real estate. If you don't have real estate either, then sure, you don't go to jail under my ideal government, but you'd have to live a life where you pay for rent without a bank account, can't hold a job that pays fiat wages, can't have a fiat bank account (so no debit or credit card ), can't drive, and can't own real estate or vehicles. Maybe even they invalidate your passport and post your name online as a scofflaw to publicly shame you, too.
If you're OK with all that, then fine, you can live your life without being a part of polite society, and you still don't go to jail. It wouldn't be a terrible life. I think allowing some anti-state contentious objectors should be fine. Society won't collapse if a few people don't participate, and coercion by inconveniencing citizens is better than state-backed violence.
But going back to OP for a moment, the idea of being a multi-millionaire with all of those restrictions would be rather silly, don't you think? If I had millions, I'd much rather be a part of society than live under all those restrictions. After all, money usually _frees_ people from restrictions, rather than adding to them. And if your life sucks so much that that whole list of restrictions doesn't matter to you, then sure, be a scofflaw. You've probably got no money anyway.

Trusts have bank accounts. Even if offshore, anytime you try to repatriate funds to actually use them, they're seizable.
I think coercion through violence should be extremely restricted, but there is a place for it in society, don't you agree? Men with guns are properly located at banks (to prevent theft), airports (to prevent the vanishingly small chance of terrorism), jails (to prevent jailbreak of violent criminals (not I didn't say escape -- it's possible to continue to keep the unarmed detained without actually killed them)), and borders. If you try to go to Mexico without a passport, you won't be shot, but you'll be physically denied regardless. Same with trying to fly without a passport.
But I feel like we're getting down into the weeds. In almost every case, it's possible to coerce citizens into doing what society has agreed upon without killing them, or forcing them under threat of violence. I do hope that's the future of society, rather than the libertarian pipe dream of a society without collective action (aka without government).

Slavery involved the literal buying and selling of humans, beating and killing them with impunity, splitting up mothers and small children, etc. It's not at all like asking everyone to give 5% of their time to SS, and if they don't, the system administrator would take 5% of their wages and give them to someone else that agrees to do their share of the work. Asking all able-bodied people to work two hours a week to support the elderly, under risk of being fined (not even jailtime -- not paying taxes results in fines and levies these days), seems rather virtuous to me. And I still support using money as a way to allocate resources, I'm just pointing out that money is an entirely social construct.

The idea that charities will fill gaps in government safety net is wishful thinking. Put yourself into the shoes of an elderly person that wasn't lucky enough to be able to save money (say he/she was injured on the job at 50 and went broke paying for healthcare). People don't want their food or medicine to appear 'miraculously', or to depend the philanthropy of others, they want it every day, without fail.
How about this for a slogan: "Everybody Gives, Everybody Benefits.". We'll administer it centrally, to avoid having freeloaders that don't help with supporting the elderly, as well as to make sure no elderly slip through the cracks into extreme poverty. In fact, this was Truman's argument in 1946. See ["The Conservative Myth of a Social Safety Net Built on Charity: The right yearns for an era when churches and local organizations took care of society's weakest—an era that never existed and can't exist today."

California is my community. I like parks. I use highways.

The Univ of California is great, and there are public schools that get funding.  Some like to call social security a 'ponzi scheme', but it's certainly not a failure -- if you look at the numbers, it's been extremely effective at reducing extreme poverty of the elderly.

It's true, I look more at outcomes than policy ideology. What a policy does is more important than the apparent justification.
No one will get "nothing". Even if there is no savings account for SS, SS would still pay out 77% of benefits well past 2050 as [taxes collected by young people would go directly to old people]( I think everyone should be OK with paying for housing, food, and healthcare for the elderly that can no longer work. But by the 2050s, after the SS trust fund runs out (assuming no changes), it won't matter because societal efficiencies should be higher, and so their dollars will go further:
* more efficient farms, from robotic tractors to seeds to automated pickers
* 75% of power from non-fossil sources (at least in California), reducing consumable costs.
* widespread adoption of assisted living robots to reduce cost of healthcare for elderly
Maybe SS isn't right for the 2120s, I really don't know. But SS has helped generations of people so far, and it's not time to stop anytime soon. It's not worth trying to solve problems 100 years in advance, or even 20 years in advance, if the current system is working.
One can make the argument that money (and hence wealth and future SS income) is a completely human construct, and that the fundamental units of society are human time &amp; human labor. Money/wealth is currently how we allocate labor: who has to work for others, and who gets others to work for them (and let's ignore real estate, Giffen goods, etc, from this analysis) . What I'm saying by supporting SS, or something like it, is that I think everyone over the age of 70 should be able to compel, say, 4 hours a week of labor from people under the age of 70. And every working person would have to work 2 hours a week for the elderly, assuming there are twice as many working people as elderly. The whole idea that a society supports the elderly when they need it. And I'm OK with this -- are you? For the working, 2 hrs out of 40 is 5% of income, which is about what social security costs right now. 23% of the 3.8T federal budget goes towards social security, so if you're paying 30% of your income as federal taxes, you're paying 7% of your gross income to social security right now.

If I had $1M, sure, I'd earn an easy 3% doing the arbitrage from bitstamp to mtgox, and the reason is hasn't gone away is that I don't have $1M, and it seems you don't, either.

The real answer:

Actually, he's quite a badass that got a EE degree before going into medicine.  He's treating [Sasha Shulgin]( (of MDMA fame), and Ann seems pretty happy that this doctor suggested a few things that previous doctors didn't suggest to help him keep his leg.
As far as [paleo]( and [quant coaching]( being 'quackery', well, stay skeptical and try digging into those subreddits for a while.  Five years ago, I'd have said the exact same thing you are.

I made a $1000 domestic USD withdrawal on June 15th, which is marked as "confirmed" but still hasn't been moved to "processed".  Since this pre-dates their announcement by 3 business days, I figure I should be one of the first to see a withdrawal.
Now that the spread between MtGox and Bitstamp has narrowed, I wonder if it's time to jump ship...

I'd wonder where the rest of my bitcoins went. ([h/t](
