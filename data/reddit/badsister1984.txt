That's not really how the Federal Labor Law works.  There are built in incentives I believe for the lawyer to take these cases.

What do you do, or is there a plan for pooled tips?  For instance, if there is a bar with multiple bartenders and barback, aren't those tips pooled?  How would that work?

Hi Barack, glad to see you're still interested in law as I was VERY concerned about whether you actually attended law school.  J/K.
What concerns me most is: [paraphrase] "We've got to be at the courthouse in 20 minutes!!"  And then the judge talking personally to the plaintiff, "Look how many messages I've got!"
Um, what?  That sounds so…..Matlock!

I have been a plaintiff in wages civil suit.  My attorney worked on contingency and the attorney's wages come from the court award.

I believe that when PayPal processes Visa/MC, they become a merchant processor for that transaction.  They charge a fee to the seller to accept these cards.  The fee is $19.99.  So, they are not accepting credit cards on behalf of someone else.  They would be a legitimate "merchant processor."  That's what all merchant processors do.  When you use your Visa, it is not processed by Visa it's processed by another company; FirstData, Heartland, EVO International, are examples of merchant processors.
