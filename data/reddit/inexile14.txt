Sorry - my question wasn't clear. I'm interested in the work itself.  How is the actual block (list of transactions, etc) different from one miner to the next in a pool?  Is it still the address in coinbase transaction that makes it so block hashes with similar nonces yield varying results?  
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:06:34
Thanks. Still don't have it (2 hours later), but I'll keep eyes out.

And if losses are socialized, would users with only non-BTC balances (e.g. fiat, ETH) share in the redistribution?  
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:27:47
To be fair, you're not actually saying anything. The communication from management has been extraordinarily poor. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:11:46
This exactly. But it's also sad that opinions are generally falling into one of two camps. One camp says bitgo violated their duty of care and should be liable. Another says bfx users knew the risks of storing coins in a hot wallet. These ideas aren't mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:14:14
These exchanges are already gov't regulated (KYC, etc). And yet, here we are. The amount of information required to participate on these exchanges may give their customers a false sense of security. 
I'm guessing that very few of the Bfx victims are risk averse. But looking forward, how can the lessons learned improve our decision making?
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:50:06
You can also import your address as a "watch-only" address into Mycelium (or other hot wallet) to keep tabs on your balance without ever exposing your private jets.

@_date: 2016-08-04 11:26:12
The customer is not aways right.  Companies are accountable to ethical standards, cultural norms, and myriad stakeholders. Blindly accepting customer demands which undermine these priorities is generally very bad for business. Case in point (if Bitgo laid down at bfx's request).

Is this a good way to run offline armory?  Can ubuntu run on Raspberry Pi?

After two days of struggling, I ended up connecting the Pi to the internet for 30 seconds to download Matchbox-Keyboard so that I could sign a transaction.

These are expensive solutions. It's sad that the average user cannot securely print a paper wallet.  If common distros came compiled with common print drivers, or if somebody could compile a distro with, for instance, all HP print drivers, this would be a big help. 
I've taken to writing down public key and brain wallet pass phrase and storing in SD box. But writing it down makes me nervous - would rather print a paper wallet with BIP38 encryption.

@_date: 2014-02-14 17:24:58
Actually, Electrum is simpler because it doesn't require Bitcoin-Qt, correct?  I plan to use this as the online half of my cold storage setup (offline Raspberry Pi is the other half).  Sound right?  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:26:23
Perfect - that's how I read the situation.  And I could easily reformat the SD card and load the BitcoinPi image back on to be safe.

This is the beauty of Bitcoin - the Blockchain is still intact and, as intended, is the only authoritative rendering of every transaction.  To Andreas's point, the network will only become more resilient for this debacle.

Sorry for my stupidity, but I really want to understand this. So iterating my paraphrase doesn't create any additional risk?  Meaning, once I use my private key to spend BTC connected with my original paraphrase, attackers still wouldn't have any heightened ability to guess the original paraphrase?

Super excited.  I'm not very technical, but cold storage is at the essence of Bitcoin.  I need to get it working.
One question - to prepare the SD card, I need to download utility.  Does the utility run on Linux, or only on Windows?  If my Chromebook doesn't have an SD card reader, what do you suggest?
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:04:21
Wow - is this what I think it is?  I know nothing about Raspbian but I do have a Raspberry Pi.  This download goes right on an SD card and will work as plug and play???

Government can't control bitcoin. Ever. This is precisely the point. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:14:59
For small amounts, use a blockchain.info online wallet with two-factor authentication. For larger amounts (which you should not be holding until you've done another 100 hours of research), a paper wallet stored in a safe or safe deposit box. 
BTC is fairly liquid. Try LocalBitcoins.com as a jumping off point. 
Don't invest in BTC unless you fully understand the risks. It's still extremely speculative and, therefore, prone to major price fluctuations. But buy a small amount and have fun learning about this incredible technology/invention. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:05:40
How can they do either of these things?  
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:06:49
These are not mutually exclusive concepts. The great promise of Bitcoin (the invention) is that it is indestructible. The falling of an exchange, or all exchanges, poses no threat to the future of decentralized currencies. If Bitcoin (the currency) should fail, something better will arise.

Since Bitcoin clearly is being used as a spamming mechanism (this will only escalate with broader adoption), will we soon be able to tag a receiving address such that any payments below a certain threshold are denied?  This could be extremely useful.

Why do they deserve respect?  They are ostensibly providing a service for the "good of bitcoin". To hear them speak, I'm a believer. But I think his point is that there is no room for a core development team, a foundation, or any other central "authority" in a decentralized system. And it's naive to think that the core devs are not authorities in this sense. This is a valid point of view that should be debated.

This is a great point.  I have no BTC or fiat with Gox, but they are acting like criminals and I'm surprised the market has reacted positively to this [lack of] news.  The elephant in the room is the lack of empathy they have for their customers.

Nobody knows if/when a correction will occur. If the prospect of a short term dip in value is scary to you, then you have your answer. If you believe in the underlying utility of Bitcoin and are interested in holding it for some time as a store of value, then now is a great time to take payment on BTC.  Point is - nobody can answer this question for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:00:04

Of course. I pay my taxes - not my point. Blockchain will quickly evolve to the point where the masses will have easy and ubiquitous access to every manner of value token.

Nope, it’s all taxable. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:47:33
I thought you already had your USD in the exchanges and were trying to combine the Bitcoin you purchased into a single wallet which you control. 
As for transferring USD, Gemini offers unlimited wires (1 bus day) in/out, and an even faster ACH option which is limited to $500/day.

Nice. But how do the exchanges deal with this? If there were a targeted attack on the n’s, all of the customers’ funds would be lost. Just curious how the largest wallets are protecting their coins m.

How difficult would it be, assuming the current state of BTC and altcoins, for the attacker to convert these coins to fiat without being caught?
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:05:24
Currently, no.

These coins were moved OUT of this address in May.  
Edit: Once your wallet syncs, you'll see that the balance in this address is 0.

No. Bitcoin is unique because it provides an alternative to government-backed currency. Check out Saifedean’s book - it’s eye opening.

I'm not arguing against the inherent value or efficacy of Proof of work, just suggesting that innovation is inevitable and should naturally lead to cleaner and more efficient consensus algorithms. I don't know enough about PoS to assume it's a a better solution, but I'm asking whether others agree that PoW will someday be replaced. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:24:08
It's basically free, and for your use case, probably the best solution. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:45:25
The arbitrage is likely due to the fact that it is much more difficult to get fiat into Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:19:49
First, study/learn as much as you can. 
Second, don't buy any crypto until you've learned enough to say "I personally understand WHY this is a good investment, and even if the price drops 20-50% overnight, I would be comfortable holding on to it."
If you can't make this statement, then you're gambling, not investing. This is true for any investment, not just crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:52:59
Ledger Nano S holds many of them. Check out their website.

Disagree with your premise. Gov't bans drugs which only makes them more valuable (supply v demand). A government ban would likely make Bitcoin more valuable.

If you understand Bitcoin at all, his comments about crypto will seem strikingly uneducated. Happy to provide 5-10 examples if you’re interested. I’ve always respected Peter’s view on precious metals v fiat,geopolitics and economics. He just happens to know nothing about crypto currency and is all too willing to make uninformed and inaccurate statements about it.

Bitcoin is a new and unprecedented asset class, so it's hard to know. The nature of the crisis will likely play a role. A crisis such as 2008 might have seen a sharp decline in Bitcoin as investors lost faith in most asset classes but the Fed was still able to keep the dollar strong through manipulation of interest rates and quantitative easing. In the next crisis (which must eventually happen), it's possible that faith in the world's reserve currency would make Bitcoin the perfect safe haven. And since Bitcoin is far superior to gold as a store of value, it could become the single highest performing asset class.

Why are Russell’s and Hemsworth’s names above the opposite’s likeness?  This is maddening.

You have nothing to worry about - backlog is bad right now, but your transaction will eventually confirm and your address should still be good.

"When you notice an attack, minimize your use of the bitcoin network. That means it'll cost the attacker a lot more, as miners will be mining more of their transactions"
Love this.

How do you easily protect against mistakes?  Perhaps write down the private key and a corresponding 12 word mnemonic?
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:12:38
Would love to read the counterpoint on this, but appreciate the clarity/thoroughness of the argument. For those in favor of off-chain payments, how do you address the mining fee / centralization arguments presented here?
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:08:58
The 12 word seed IS the backup. Store a copy in a safe or safe deposit box (or both). If anything happens to your phone, you can simply reinstall Jaxx and restore your wallet from the 12 word seed.

You've nothing to worry about. 
Download Myceleum or Jaxx or Bread Wallet for iOS.  "Spend" your BTC from your Blockchain wallet to the new wallet. Now, just sit and wait. Because you control your private keys, you'll have coins on both sides if there is a chain split. Once the dust settles, the community will guide you further. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:02:18
If so, why isn't it still happening?

Would this work, with a thermal printer?  Will paper/ink degrade if laminated?
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:54:53
This method assumes that 100% of the arbitrage between Exchange Group A and B is attributable to the implied BitcoinCash price. Could there not be [numerous] other factors which contribute to these differentials?
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:23:45
And both are terrible choices as you're trusting a third party to hold your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:43:05
Market value would approach zero. Nobody would consider Bitcoin to be valuable or viable as a currency with such a distribution. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:05:26
Hardware wallets are super convenient. Way more than a bank. You can carry it with you everywhere, and store the seed on a piece of paper in a safe deposit box.  And you're done!  Instant access to your funds, totally secure, and backed up in case of theft/loss.

@_date: 2017-06-29 22:54:31
Wrong inference. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:56:46
If you believe that Bitcoin is a superior form of money to fiat because it’s inherently deflationary (fixed supply) and that people will gradually be drawn to its utility, then you should buy bitcoin and it worry about its value as expressed in fiat (inflationary) currency, then you should acquire Bitcoin. 
If you believe something else, Bitcoin isn’t for you. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:05:53
It depends on the exchange and on your security settings. Sometimes a confirmation email is sent - you must confirm before the transaction is processed. 
You should be able to monitor the transaction status on Coinbase.

What you're describing is commonly referred to as a "dead man's switch". Smart contracts can be written to accomplish this. We'll soon see user-friendly services which will allow this kind of transfer. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:44:31
This is a big question, and one worth exploring further!
There are may great options, each with its own strengths and risks. 
For large amounts - hardware wallets are generally favored. Paper wallets can also work. 
For small to medium amounts - HD wallets for your mobile device (jaxx, mycelium, etc) are free, easy and secure. 
Two most important concepts you MUST understand:
1. Never store your Bitcoin on an exchange; always transfer the Bitcoin (private keys) to a wallet which you control personally. 
2. Backup your wallet!!  I won't go into the various techniques here, but they are all EASY to follow and good instruction can be found online.

Bitcoin is useful as a stable, portable, permission-less store of value. Let's say you have $50,000 in the bank. What if inflation erodes the purchasing power of your dollars over time?  What if currency controls are put in place and you're unable to access your dollars?  What if you try to withdraw your money and are put on a watchlist?
Bitcoin offers an alternative to other stores of value, each of which has its pros/cons. Many here believe that Bitcoin is superior to fiat, precious metals, and other stores of value for these and other reasons. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:35:27
I don't like Coincap or Coinmarketcap - USD prices are often much higher than the actual exchange(s) you may work with. Best solution is to check prices on the exchange sites themselves, or to use Bitcointicker.co or others that allow you to see prices on individual exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:54:08
As much as we all believe in the longevity and strength of Bitcoin, some amount of diversification is always advisable. Find your threshold and, once you hit it, stop accumulating. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:42:03
You may want to get yourself a hardware wallet (Ledger Nano S or Trezor) - much easier than the route you're taking and less prone to errors which could cost you value. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:34:17
Similar, yes. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:20:56
That's a lot of shmeckles!
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:39:56
This is good advice.  You could also laminate the paper wallets and/or seed words for longevity.

Bitcointalk.org is the place to buy/sell casascius coins - these are really cool and pretty valuable as Mike Caldwell, the creator, was shut down three years ago. Any "funded" coins out there are part of a fairly limited and scarce supply, and have numismatic value in addition to the embedded Bitcoin and precious metal.
