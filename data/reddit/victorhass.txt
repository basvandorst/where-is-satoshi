ethereum. and it'll upgrade to airplane when it switches to proof of stake
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:56:44
Be ready for anything after this mad spike that is going on right now
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:44:50
There's a small but steady wealth transfer from fiat to crypto going on. The value of fiat is slowly decreasing, but it can be masked to look like it is unaffected. Basically, 1 dollar will buy a nickel's worth later on (inflation) and you won't measure your gains against USD. Bitcoin or whatever crypto is mainstream will be the default thing.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:23:23
what?? lmao
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:12
this is unreal. something is clearly going on
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:07:38
You're not a good friend...
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:59:50
You really think that's what caused the dip? Not the massive profit taking from those who caused the huge pump early on?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:06:34
Most people here firmly believe that BTC is undervalued and with increased adoption will see gradual spike on value. But there's events like CME futures launching and who knows what's gonna happen. If I knew, I would not tell you and keep the massive profit to myself haha
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:38:31
Will you eat your nut if you're wrong? haha
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:55:55
it will drop as soon as the fork is done
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:52:09
Look at the prices now... I told you

2x redditor for 2 days, now I feel this info is credible
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:18:35
The text makes it look pretty positive, don't be fooled though. They're only willing to recognize cryptos so they can pass legislation to tax the shit out of their ridiculous returns.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:09:06
Every single time, you people never learn? Haha I love those dips after ATH
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:01:50
Yes, and it is one of the best strategies. You're not going big in at first, but you're slowly building your portfolio, you're unintentionally doing a dollar-cost averaging
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:34:32
some dude bought a whoping 200 btc at once 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:33:05
Exchanges in my country haven't caught up with the price spike yet, I'm buying like crazy too lol, big profits coming
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:38:31
From your line of thought, check out IOTA
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:51
You can't easily tell, otherwise everyone would be taking the profit from pumps and dumps. Maybe it's just a massive buying, maybe it's pump and dump, you only know it when it starts happening. Only the big players can know where the tide will turn and take in their profit. By the way, nobody in venezuela will trust anything from the government that has ruined their lives.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:49:37
i find it very hard to believe that you totally forgot such a massive amount of $ you spent
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:28:53
I saw that too. Ate through the wall like it was nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:07
Yes, but you'll likely get destroyed 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:22:12
i misread as buying 5000 BTC worth 50 pounds each, total of 250k pounds
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:15:16
I'm brazilian and their agenda is pretty simple: they saw the spike on BTC price and on the number of investors. They have no regulation on taxation of cryptocurrency gains, they're DYING to get a bite of that cake. Keep in mind that Brazil's taxes are among the biggest in the world by far.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:14:47
I would wait a bit, something is going on at cryptoland as right now almost all of the top 100 coins are at double digit % gains, everyone should watch carefully. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:57:42
I believe it too, but only with 5% of my portfolio... Risk mitigation comes first imo
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:53:10
It has to lose momentum sometime, and then people will start taking profits causing a dip. You can never know how low it goes though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:28:33
Shows that mid 2016 the "legal" BTC balances overcame the "illegal" ones, do not know their criteria
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:24:32
Tbh I wouldn't be able to hold my tongue lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:36:49
That's up to you to read and decide. I personally use GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:41:24
it means there's lots of buy requests @ 7500, so the price will hardly go further down than that
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:47:15
Transfer to an exchange
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:10:12
Then live by your words! If you are willing to give 4 years worth of your time to pay this loan for the chance to really change your life, go for it. And best of luck.
Just really take your time and think about it, be rational and weigh the consequences. After you make your choice don't hesitate or you'll likely regret it for the rest of your life.

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:30:33
Yes, bought my Ledger Nano S with BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:00:44
I just mean it is a HUGE gamble you're gonna take, your life could go from bad to terrible, or you could be successful in your goal. Personally I would not invest in this manner, try to save up some, even small amounts would do to get you started risklessly
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:40:01
It becomes more scarce on the market, so the value increases.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:45:36
BTC prices go up and down very quickly, as you'll get to notice. The price is going back to normal again here.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:25:16
It will happen on this week.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:41:41
Another attempt to dethrone BTC. Probably won't happen but you never know...
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:11:42
It's fast recovering
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:38:13
Umm yes? And they moved from their country and are living comfortably in Orlando
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:47:11
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:26:33
It's the end of bitcoin!!! BTCash is the real future of crypto!!1! Sell all now and ride ver's ... /s
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:54:30
As much as I love bitcoin and I believe it will succeed in its goal, NEVER invest more than you can afford, let alone spend money that isn't even yours, This could end up horribly for you
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:37:38
They still recieve from transaction fees, but yes it becomes less profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:53:27
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:13:23
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:21:59
Well, thanks for the post. I did get in this small dip :) Now HODL and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:58
yes sell it all so i can buy them cheaper
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:01:08
Any time is a good time to start, as long as you invest only what you can afford to lose. I'd do my reading and get a better understanding of crypto and then make a move.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:03:51
the dip is NOW
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:36:59
Way I see is BTC has already gone past this big speculatory phase. Yes, price variation is still big by the hour, but as media attention grows and the news of increasing value becomes widespread, it is becoming a rush to acquire a limited currency. At this rate, only something out of normality, say MtGox 2.0 would cause some big crash.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:25:40
deny the fact that BTC is the real thing, they'll all love you :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:11:18
Contact the bitcoin hahahah

"if net neutrality is killed".
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:56:09
was expecting a SpaceX logo too
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:30:29
The latter basically, and it may not even happen
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:12:15
No idea. But I see a bright future ahead for HODLers
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:52:09
Thing is USD price is not controlled my market itself, it is regulated by government, and it is widely used by the population to basically live. Bitcoin is hardly used for purchases as of now, so people who own it keep it, and people who wanna buy it have to buy at higher prices, and the cycle goes on. With the increasing popularity of BTC and the upcoming events of futures and all, nobody knows for sure what could happen. I, for one, HODL half of my BTC and the other half I play with during oscilations.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:03:30
There's always a dip after these spikes. Bought me some cheap BTC. Now we carry on..
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:06:15
I think it might be going back up anytime now
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:36:39
my body is ready
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:07:19
Little bird told me there will be a big dip in a few days
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:32:54
Exactly. That would be North Korean level of censorship. They would never go as far as banning VPNs and the likes of Tor, the backlash would be too big. Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:59:24
I'm pretty sure it's orlando..
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:23:30
means you're no longer a noob :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:23:26
too soon
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:51:11
The Tether incident has played a role on this, your timing was not the best to go all-in lol :( But it will pay off in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:00:47
I'll call it whatever I want, and calling it Bcash helps newcomers tell bitcoin core from bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:46:14
Per governmental decree.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:27
I almost had a heart attack lol. But the HODL in me spoke higher
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:31:53
102.5% ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:38:07
They're afraid of people opening their eyes and realizing their fiat money is weak.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:52:44
I told you.
