I don't see how you comfortably came to the conclusion that it was Bittrex that sold your information. Does anyone have any evidence of this happening?

They 3d printed this card. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:46:35
Like with a stamp? Maybe, but I can tell because of the underextrusion and because I've seen a lot of 3D prints in my days.
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:18:13
This is how they get you. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:45:49
I could be as well! Your statement is very true and not realized by a lot of people that 3D print things.

My grandpa owned an apartment in Venezuela, and what you say is unfortunately true. Tenants are completely protected, there is no way to get them out. The tenants (squatters) he had didn't pay for over two years, the only option is to hire thugs to forcibly remove the people, and then you'll probably need armed security guarding the place to protect from retaliation.
He decided to just forget about it.

I bought from the first guy I saw in my area without any problems. Are you meeting them in person and paying with cash?

A little off topic, but Gemini wouldn't verify my bank online either so I had to send them a wire transfer. I had to go to my bank and pay $15. However, after it goes through, you can then use ACH. You only need to do 1 wire transfer.

This is *kind of* what you're describing.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:28:08
I'm very glad to hear that! They would appreciate it, but it looks like they have a few samples so I wouldn't trouble yourself. Best wishes!

What's a wired radio? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:29:43
You're missing out!
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:04:13
You'd like it there.

It is in the extortionists best interest to decrypt your files if you pay the ransom, otherwise no one would pay. A fairly recent exception was WannaCry, which did not have a robust mechanism of linking payments to victims. GlobeImpostor does have such a mechanism, which is hopeful. [This]( is the same malware by a different name, and they recieved a response.
Make sure you included the "ID" or whatever key it is they wanted, they will need to use that key to build you a decryptor. I'd send them an email if they provided their address and just give them a little reminder. 
Stay hopeful, but save a backup of your encrypted files. If they don't respond, the encryption will most likely be broken in the future.

Bitcoin has a hard cap. There is no way to change it. There is no such thing as an "artificial programming variable".

I'm fairly well versed in this stuff, this appears to be GlobeImposter 2.0 which there is no known way of decrypting as of yet. I hope I'm wrong, but that's all I could find. I'm very sorry, do not communicate that you are a business, as they probably don't know that if the ransom is this low.

Forks have happened many times, and bitcoin is still king. I don't understand what you're getting at. Shouldn't that prove that it's stronger?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:09:04
Wow, I had no idea the general public still was this uninformed.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:54:53
Great response! You made that work really well.

 is just some spam blog. You poor poor thing.
