Paypal stands to gain NOTHING by supporting bitcoin.
What are they going to do with bitcoin?
Provide a feedback system for bitcoin trades?

I'm fully support your frustration from the banks. I worked in a bank and saw how everything works inside. 
Bitcoin is solving bank's problems such as the speed of transactions and the absence of intermediaries.

Its not what they've done so far. Question is- what they plan to do now? How are they going to help affiliate? 
Believe it or not! Bitcoin Foundation is representative of Bitcoin. Not to us, but to general public. Okay?

index of adoption which is good non based will lead us to the moon. Kinda bad rhyme
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:58:18
I totally agree!
This game is pretty damn good. When you play this indie game, you can't stop!
PS It's a good marketing ploy for Bitcoins

Where is the safest place online to purchase bitcoins if I'm from Japan? Сan you give me an advice? Please!
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:13:38
u mad bro
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:47:45
ITA that this news will lead to the implementation of the assistance Bitcoins. 
But shoud not  forget that this industry involves a lot of transactions, which may later lead  Bitcoin to the spread. Maybe it's for the best!
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:13:34


I think this is an important observation. But such is the Bitcoin system and nobody can change it.
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:39:45
I think it is awesome! 
I wish I had so much BTC to buy a house
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:58:51
I am also disappointed with Apple's attitude to Bitcoins! I'm thinking about changing the iphone to Samsung, but I can not decide on the model. Can anyone give me some advice about it?
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:58:35
I think the introduction of payment by Bitcoin is unjustified. This can be a waste of time for GoCityHotels because only about 3 percent of customers can take advantage of this.

I don't like design of Dark Wallet, it's uncomfortable! But it is provides privacy and protection as I understand.
 Is it Google Inc. product?
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:46:33
I like BTC. Its great for payments and other meta applications but its just not the best way to save. IMO, gold is for saving, bitcoin is for spending.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:45:43
1 : 11740  I'm shocked
That's okay, because when internet user in 2014 and 2000 is very big difference. If bitcoin success, there will be many user than now 
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:46:18
I don't understand,  is currently shooting a film about Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:27:33
IMO MIT could become one the biggest BTC playground cos it's already have tech base and the best students. 
But organizers need to consider how to use BTC. May be students can  to pay for their lunch using BTC?
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:18:23
It's so hot for you? 
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:13:32
That's a best example of how time can change everything
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:28:37
What program do you use to make wallpaper for Dark wallet? Wallpapers  are beautiful, I like it
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:34:26
It looks attractive and stylish! 
Is Bitcoin the only means of payment in your company?  If the answer is yes  I'd recommend to display this information.

Oh yeah, It's my thoughts after breakfast every morning
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:10:33
Whoa whoa whoa! Slow it down! It's sounds so amazing i can't believe! 
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:47:06
I don't get why they did this... I mean this screams 'failure'... :/ This is horrible news, where have we come to if even such a Pro-Bitcoin country decides to drop the support for it? At least the price didn't tank that hard...
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:18:10
Now we have the internet provider who will provide the internet on the moon
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:13:15
I'm regret not having bought Bitcoin when I first heard about it in 2010
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:14:23
Seems that you have nothing to do except checking somebodies post history
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:58:36
It would be more such good and honest people like you! You're a nice guy!
 I wonder which type of wallet was used by the owner of the  BTC?
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:46:46
It is an interesting view on BTC. I liked this video. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:18:40
Actually I think that forks of Bitcoin will extinct as dinosaurs in the nearest future, while other advanced tech will take the lead.
