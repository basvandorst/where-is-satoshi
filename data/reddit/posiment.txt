Exactly.  The market price is what someone is willing to pay.  However, I'm pretty sure no one is paying attention to you and your sale, however they will be paying attention to the auction.  The market will adjust to what the price is paid at the auction.

What I understood him to say was currently they view bitcoin as a payment platform, not a currency since it is not regulated as one, and is deemed an asset.  
He also said Western Union could use bitcoin as a payment protocol but when asked if they would send/receive bitcoin as a regular currency is when he said it would have to be regulated (and yeah commented on how it wasn't issued by a central bank).  If it got regulated as a currency they could add it to the hundred plus currencies they already deal with.
It wouldn't really make sense for WU to send and receive bitcoin like a currency on behalf of customers, since you can do that on your own essentially free.  What does make sense is for WU to use the blockchain to send and receive money, replacing their antiquated EFT systems.

I've listened to it a few times with my wife who is Japanese.  They don't hint at anything that would imply the coins are retrievable.  Basically they say the coins are lost as a result of a bug in their system which they found out about early February.  They mentioned someone illegally accessing their system (like a hacker) who stole the coins.  
That is a very rough translation.

Not only that but they have a very solid team and in my opinion when they launch they will give Coinbase some very strong competition.

Makes no sense whatsoever.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:42:37


The only problem is the amount of debt to be paid off, which we now know to be 850,000 BTC *plus* $63.6 Million USD.  I used to think the same thing but I'm just not sure anymore.  
The volume on the exchange is so so valuable to a new player trying to enter the market but its going to be tough dealing with that debt.  And there is no volume without customer BTC and no customer BTC without a massive investment ($425 million based on a price of $500/BTC x 850k BTC, or $375 million if you take out the MtGox BTC)

They've done it before.  When they were hacked back in 2011 they gave their customers bitcoins back out of their own pocket.


This is completely ridiculous speculation,  you have absolutely no evidence of this whatsoever.  There is no evidence to says they lost any BTC at all.  The amount of bandwagon jumping around here is hilarious.  Mtgox has massive management problems, that is for certain. But a few people accuse Mtgox of being insolvent or losing BTC and everyone jumps in.  No wonder people can manipulate this market so easily.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:19:12
Very true.  However I wasn't saying a cash system was too big, I'm saying it makes more sense for them to build a payment system using the Bitcoin protocol.  One of the biggest challenges for Apple or Google is getting users to migrate from their existing habits (cash &amp; cards) to using their phones.  Coinbase on the other hand has over a million users already, with wallets ready to go.  That is a significant user base for them to tap into.  Why fight an uphill battle when you can just integrate bitcoin with your mobile wallet and tap into an already willing and able user base.  And of course being that Bitcoin offers them a very low cost payment system saves them from having to build and manage their own proprietary system.  By the way this is exactly what BitReserve and Circle are doing. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:59:20
You are right however the auction has nothing to do with the exchange order books, it would be purely a sentiment thing.  If the coins auction at $1000 a piece you can guarantee the price on the exchanges will rise.  On the other hand if they auction for $100 the exchange prices will drop.  My opinion anyway. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:49:11

Yes indeed, that's what I meant by his "excuse". Really bizarre he could claim that many coins lost at all, whether due to tx mall or whatever, how do you not notice this?

Thanks for this. I have not been watching Gox today, and was wondering myself if the decline was due to large sells, many small ones, etc.
I propose another theory.  If it was indeed someone selling every hour a couple of hundred coins, what if this were the scenario:
* This person or persons has thousands of BTC and perhaps some fiat on Gox. 
* They sell a few hundred BTC every hour for say 24 hours.  Let's say a total of 5000 BTC
* This drops the price continually. 
* They then, suddenly, buy a whack of coins with the fiat they have just generated and whatever else they have in Gox
* They then, just as suddenly, sell those coins (we saw this today when the price suddenly shot up to $540 and then within 30 minutes dropped right back down to $300)
* Now we are in the next cycle
To me, this seems like a very simple and logical explanation for this.  But just a complete guess, like I said I haven't been watching Gox (but now I wish I had)
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:21:39

Totally agree with you that it would be massively overoptimistic to firstly believe that someone managed to steal that many BTC (at lease the way they are explaining it) and that they'd be able to find them.  More and more it seems like they've lost the funds/BTC over the past few years simply because they were using them to run their business.

Tracking down missing transfers
MtGox receives a number of transfers on a daily basis that we or our bank cannot process due to missing or incomplete information. We can only complete these transfers when we are contacted by the customers. Please take the time to double check that all of the details you give us are correct.
Deposits: Transfers may not be processed because your bank requires further information or additional details have not been included.
Withdrawals: Issues can occur because the name and address provided does not match that as it appears on your bank statement.
If you believe you have made an error when sending funds or you haven't received your funds after the required processing time (XX full business days as it relates to your transfer) please do not hesitate to contact us so we can investigate the issue.

You could be right, the only thing is the credibility of those you are implying as involved (Roger Ver, TwoBitIdiot) would be ruined if they were in some sort of elaborate conspiracy.

"Wire transfer" to me sounds like they are no longer able to use the interbank system, so I guess it would be like most other exchanges where you'd have to physically go to your bank and wire funds, in North America using SWIFT or SEPA in Europe.  I don't know what system it is in China.  
So maybe this means interbranch transfers are out (no more 2 hour transfers, but similar to the rest of us), and wire transfers are the way they are going (for the next month or two before the PBOC stops them as well)

I think he quoting from this article
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:59:07
Well, we know he went to a group of investors (it is assumed it was the bitcoin foundation and/or those involved with the Joint Statement), at which time they denounced Karpeles and called the FBI.  But we don't know *why* they called the FBI, but it would be safe to assume it is because Karpeles was commiting fraud by arbitraging through Gox and the other exchanges.  The bitcoin foundation is now working with the FBI helping them with their investigation into Gox.  So, it is speculation, but it really starts to make sense.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:02:54
Costs can add up very quickly, especially when losing such a significant amount of money when the US seized the $5 million.  This alone would have set them back significantly.  Karpeles leased an apartment in Tokyo for $15K USD a month, funneled $780k annually to his other company for "consulting fees", had massive legal fees (compared to other businesses), etc. etc.

Agreed.  Coindesk are very biased in their reporting, especially towards gox, and I find them to be unprofessional.  I think they are the largest bitcoin news site simply because they were the first (I'm guessing).  
However this article is very interesting and the comparison to online gambling is compelling.  But none the less just more speculation and frankly dangerous reporting by coindesk since they provide no real evidence whatsoever.  But if true very concerning.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:30:11

Source for all your claims of things he said?
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:22:08
This makes no sense.  First of all they can't replace anyone's BTC if they don't have any BTC to replace it with.  The bitcoins are gone; whether through a hack or, in my opinion, more likely a result of MtGox using customer funds (missing now, apparently) and BTC to fund operations.  More importantly is why they'd leave this liability out.  In my opinion the reason this question is being asked is that it seems odd that they'd leave the BTC liability out of all of this.  Basically according to this document theyve filed with (and approved by) Tokyo District Court, they are saying they are not liable for customer BTC.  Finally, according to this, they have no BTC assets.  So if you are saying that according to an IRC chat that Mark Karpeles is saying (in a very unclear way) that he intends to replace everyone's BTC because "that's more fair to customers" I just want to warn people not to get their hopes up.

ok, in all seriousness though, in my view, bitfinex is a more feature-packed exchange, and therefore has attracted more traders.  I have read through your pastebin quite thoroughly, and asked you some very specific questions which you have not answered.  
The one thing that concerns me is your claim of delayed BTC withdrawals.  I have not seen anything to suggest this is an issue.  During and leading up to the Gox crisis, there were many, many threads all over the place that detailed with facts withdrawal issues.  I have not seen the same with bitstamp. At the very least, you could provide some links to threads that show withdrawals are not happening.

I don't consider that bulk.  It's constant and deliberate purchases of ~1000 BTC daily on average.  Compare that to the market volume and it's a drop in the bucket.  No need to panic. 
Son, I don't know how you take something like SecondMarket buying thousands of bitcoins to be a bad thing.  Read up on them and what they are doing before you worry about what may or may not happen in the future.

I think I understand what you are asking to be "could someone acquire MtGox's customer accounts and if so it is a great question.  Absolutely yes they could.  
Businesses are typically sold in one of 2 ways; shares or assets.  In a share sale, the acquiring company inherits all or part of the shares in the *existing* company.  Therefore they inherit all the liabilities and assets associated with the company.  In an asset sale, the acquiring company buys only assets; could be physical inventory, customer lists, equipment, whatever.  
In Gox's case, they'd likely not find any buyers interested in share sale since the company now has a bad reputation (name) and potential liabilities stemming from ongoing investigations (likely from Silk Road).
However Gox's assets may be of interest to a potential buyer, particularly since there is so much opportunity for exchanges.  Therefore a potential buyer could come in and say "we want to buy only your customer accounts" which is quite common.  Perhaps they'd want the trading engine (doubt it but possibly), any intellectual property, maybe the domain mtgox.com, etc.
So very good question and this is definitely a possibility, and one of the reasons I don't believe we will see mtgox simply disappear any time soon - there is still value there.

The PBOC is protecting its economy from companies that are operating like, but not regulated as, banks.  If a third party payment provider were to open up, begin offering services, collecting and holding customer funds, etc. and then simply vanish, it could be potentially devastating if the amount of money they held was at all significant.  
Look at it this way; we often hear about the issues people have with PayPal; cutting services, freezing accounts, etc.  PayPal has fought for years to ensure they are not regulated like a bank.  They hold funds, process payments, collect payments, basically do everything a bank does, but do not have to follow the same rules as banks.  In PayPal's case, and I assume as with Alibaba and Tencent, it's likely not a major risk of their closing down.  But there are hundreds of smaller companies like these in China that could potentially pull a "MtGox" and walk away with funds, legally (by declaring bankruptcy) or illegally.  China is just trying to prevent this from happening, while protecting their seemingly fragile banking system.
I mentioned this before, but Japan, one of the world leaders in Mobile Payments, had laws preventing any non-bank regulated entity from providing mobile payment services up until about 15 years ago.  They then began issuing licenses to telecoms and other companies who are not banks yet can now provide third party payment services.  I suspect Alibaba and Tencent will fight for similar regulation and in the future China will have some sort of licensing or similar for non-bank companies to provide payment related services. 
In regards to bitcoin in China, OKCoin just announced $10million in financing, and Huobi is apparently about to announce the same.  Whoever is investing in them has undoubtedly done a tremendous amount of research into this and feel comfortable enough about the future of bitcoin in China to put millions into these exchanges. 
The PBOC was deliberately "hazy" in December's Official Bitcoin Notice.  However, they have effectively forced exchanges to use banks instead of 3rd party providers, and banned bitcoin from being used as currency.  For the time being, it seems as though they are happy with that.  They have moved on and it seems bitcoin is no longer in their cross hairs.

The worrying thing here in my eyes is not only that Karpeles/Gox was involved in potentially massive manipulation through arbitrage, but that those he went to for a "bailout" shunned him, called the FBI, and forced him off the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.  In my eyes this will hurt their chances of an acquisition any time soon.  
I don't believe this is over yet at all, I would urge caution to all who say "MtGox is priced in and we can only go up from here".  If the potential investors they approached "shunned" Karpeles and called the FBI, there will be more to come.

Great insight Bruce.  As a follow up, and this question/comment may answer the question of why the trustee has not deemed customer bitcoins as property of the customers who held them on the exchange:


Would this not have something to do with the fact that customers' missing bitcoins are not indicated as a liability in the bankruptcy documents?  You may recall they were clear on the amount of cash that was missing and owing, but did not include the missing bitcoin as a liability officially in their bankruptcy/rehabilitation filing.  Karpeles was reported to have said on IRC chats that the reason for this was so they could "return missing bitcoins with bitcoins", but it seems to me that they now have effectively avoided any and all liability for customer coins.  
According to the court documents, MtGox has liabilities of ¥6,501,119,371, and assets of ¥3,841,866,163 (and now ~200,000 Bitcoins).  Period.  Therefore, as far as the trustee is concerned, there is no liability for missing bitcoins that belonged to customers, and only a criminal investigation at this point would make the trustee view it any differently.  
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:41:48
It says on their website that they are getting a lot of requests with missing information, and if that happens they will basically just ignore it.  So if you forgot to put your payer ID, they will not process anything, I think you have to resubmit your transfer.

You could be right, but the Gox.com sale would have been negotiated weeks/months ago and likely just closed on the 24th.

This is pretty much what Coinbase/Bitpay already do, a transaction is sent to their backend which confirms if there are appropriate funds available. If yes, transaction is approved (within seconds, before it hits the blockchain), if no declined.  
Exactly the same way a bank or credit card works. Upon swipe of debit/credit cards, the terminal sends a request to the issuing bank (cardholders bank) to determine if the funds are available.  But they don't actually take funds out of the account until the merchant does a "batch close" at the end of the day.

Have a look at the mybitcoin.com scam that took place back in 2011.  It was a wallet service that held ~70k BTC for customers.  One day they took down their website.  Few days later they posted a notice that said they were hacked and working on the problem.  Few days later they announced they were filing for bankruptcy.  Finally a short time after that they offered people 50% of their BTC back.  Everyone was so grateful to get 50% since they were expecting to get nothing.  No one bothered to ask where the other 50% went.

How do you know this?  Are you in China and used the system before?  I'm pretty sure its not manual; China has a pretty good system for communicating between the larger banks.  What I am trying to figure out is if this is different from the bank transfers that is being used by the other exchanges, which is sort of what it sounds like.  Sounds like instead of using the regular interbank transfer system currently used by Huobi, BTC China and OK Coin they are using a wire system, which could also be shut down like you said.

You raise some really good points; essentially we are in fact paying (slippage) to be able to spend our own money. It's like a bank charging a percentage every time we deposit and withdraw funds.  
I don't agree with what you are saying about fraud however.  In due time oportunists will devise ways to prevent fraud, in the form of better security systems.  And MtGox has sped up the pricess of building stronger exchanges with more accountability.  
But again you raise a very good point about slippage.

So for those who haven't heard of Pantera Capital, they are a hedge fund that manages money for Fortress Investment Group (who invested $10 million in Bitstamp).  Good article about their partnership [here on bloomberg](  
Fortress and Pantera announced earlier this year they would be setting up a bitcoin fund.  This would be similar to [Second Market's BIT]( and [Falcon Capital's Bitcoin Investment Fund](  
Pantera/Fortress has been relatively quiet since announcing their fund, so this SEC filing gives us a bit more detail on what they are doing.

Anyway I'm not sure and like I said maybe my understanding is incorrect.

I was just reading the articles about the warrant from the US govt last year where they seized $5 million from Gox thinking the exact same thing.  There is no mention of any BTC being seized, and then why would they seize customer BTC along with Gox's?
More and more I believe the lost BTC was part of Gox arbitraging trying to make money using customer funds and BTC.  The one piece of the puzzle that I just can't figure out is why the Bitcoin Foundation felt so compelled to [*initiate contact with the authorities*]( and report Karpeles.  He was obviously doing something incredibly wrong.  
Also, the investors he approached, after reporting his actions to the authorities (presumably through the bitcoin foundation) [immediately warned their own staff]( not to trade BTC, presumably to avoid being accused of insider trading by authorities.


I am inclined to believe that Gox lost massive amounts of coins and BTC through insider trading that went wrong.  Why else would the investors he approached contact the authorities?  Anyway this is all speculative and we won't know more until it comes right from Karpeles - or the courts

My thinking is that Apple, Google, FB or whoever would not do their own coin simply because bitcoin already has the network effect behind it.  In fact, I'd imagine using Bitcoin (big B) for their own mobile payments service would be a better option, since they could tap in to an established base of customers in the US at least who already use bitcoin, ready and willing to use their phone to pay.

Doge may have "value" on a chart, but if it were really all that valuable people wouldn't give it away.

They are not "refusing to pay" people, banks are making it difficult for them.  They deal with $millions every day.  We are dealing with something completely new here, banks are reluctant to allow $millions to flow through their networks freely from something like bitcoin which has not been regulated yet.  Also, it has just come to light that the reason MtGox faced dificulties in the first place was because silk road funds were being held there.  That is not MtGox's fault, but the US government is being careful with illegal funds being laundered through BTC.  
Finally, I have heard that MtGox's bank in Japan has placed restrictions on how many wire transfers they are allowed to do in a day.  So if they have 1000 requests for withdrawals but their bank only allows 100 per day, they have no choice but to process only 100 at a time.  There is nothing they can do.  
I will say that MtGox is far more legit that some of the other exchanges out there.  But I think they could have handled things far better than they did.  
@_date: 2014-06-29 20:02:48

Yep, you are right, that *is* pure baseless speculation.  A business owner would never do anything that reckless.  If the OP is correct, and Gox indeed did make close to $2million in fees over the past 2 weeks, it would be stupid to think that he would cause such turmoil.  Logically, he would be using everything at his disposal to fix things and make it right.  
The reason the price on Gox is below $300 tight now is because of the panicking from people on this forum and elsewhere; not because of some conspiracy from MtGox to "cause turmoil on their own exchange" as you suggest. 
Mark Karpeles is suspected to be among the top 10 holders of bitcoin [*in the world*]( He could easily just throw money into this. Not only that, in the absolute wore case scenario, he can sell MtGox *assets* to one of a multitude of investors who can take Gox's liquidity and turn it into a proper exchange. That is the very worst case scenario. 
Bottom line is, a lot of people here are talking like a bunch of panicky kids who aren't looking at this like a business.  Yes, Mark Karpeles is in over his head and Gox management is terrible.  But the baseless accusations that fly around this forum are exactly why the price is where it is today; it insights panic based on absolutely no facts.

Gold star to the guy who asks the single most asked question in r/bitcoin!  
MtGox is higher because US clients have to wait a long time to get funds out.  Therefore, people use their funds to buy BTC instead (so they can transfer out BTC quickly and cash out on another exchange), driving up the price.  
Also arbitrage evens out the other exchanges, but there is no way to arbitrage with MtGox since it takes so long to get funds out.

Thanks.  I'm not a lawyer, but to me this clearly shows they are liable for the fiat and not stolen bitcoins.  Maybe I am the only one reading it this way, but this is exactly the reason the price on Gox crashed; because people speculated that if Gox was solvent it would be easier to get fiat from the courts but not BTC.  This document, which has been approved by the Tokyo District, now says they are liable for $65million USD, but not liable for the 750,000 BTC owed.  That's how I'm reading it anyway maybe I'm wrong
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:39:54
Exactly.  I just wrote this on but I'll copy it here.  It sounds to me like the other exchanges have the same issue as Gox and are all working to fix it as we speak. I mean, what are the odds that every major exchange is having withdrawal issues the day after Gox publically announces they've had "unusual adtivity" on their wallets? So far BTCe, Bitstamp, even Coinbase and bitcoin.de users are reporting issues with BTC withdrawals. Everybody assumes it is only Gox since they are so messed up but I wouldn't necessarily trust BTCe to be any better prepared.
Edit: but exchanges not necessarily "being hacked all over the place" as you say but maybe they are just scrambling to fix this issue now that Gox has made it public.  I'd bet exchanges got a ton of emails today asking if they had this problem or not.

You are right.  But clearly transferring between a bank and exchange is. 
Look we can argue till we are blue in the face about the intentions of the PBOC, bottom line is there is clarification needed.  I have consulted a lawyer in China about this and the fact is as it stands, according to the bitcoin notice, banks are not allowed to provide services to exchanges or anyone for that matter.  Regardless, Huobi and BTCChina have somehow found a way around this.  
No matter how you cut it, merchants are forbidden to accept bitcoin as payment, and the PBOC has been quite unfriendly towards it.  We can sit and hope that something will change, but that's the bottom line.

Again i think you have to re-read my responses.  I didn't say multiple banks in multiple countries.  I said *their* bank, the bank they use in Japan.  One bank.  And yes I believe that for the reasons I list above.  If you asked me if I trust Mtgox vs the other options (Russian/Bulgarian and Slovenian exchanges), my answer is mtgox.  
Look I was trying to answer a question for you, you have my answer, if you don't like it go find an answer somewhere else.

I like how you started out there, sort of like "I'm just reporting the facts here", yet you have provided no facts whatsoever.  Then you claim that hundreds of people agree with you, but agree with what?  Your conjecture and speculation without any fact whatsoever?


Show me.  


What discrepancies?  I could just as easily say "McDonalds has been secretly selling horse meat burgers for years.  It looks bad.  They have the power to address this and the fact that they haven't means they are guilty.  
Look, we were all witness to MtGox and I have no problem admitting that I did not believe Gox was in that kind of trouble.  However, there were very clear indicators with solid evidence of their issues.  You have provided nothing.  In my eyes, you look like a FUDster plain and simple, particularly with the fact that you still have not provided any evidence of delayed BTC withdrawals (because there are none).  But the icing on the cake was when you went on to say how you are not going to try to sell Bitfinex, even though they are the best exchange in the whole wide world.  Give me a break.


Thanks for coming out.

While you have posted some very amazing news here, is correct, the PBOC banned banks from directly or indirectly dealing with bitcoin or providing bitcoin related services.  However, this is an amazing development if true, and could be potentially big news.

You still don't understand.  That's exactly what I am saying.  Since there are no fees, you could trade all day long making pennies (yuan) per trade making the volume look much higher than it is.  I don't know why you are arguing since you are basically confirming what I am saying.

I think what he is trying to say is why would the authorities seize *customer* BTC and not just MtGoxs?  


This makes a lot of sense especially considering they seized MtGox funds *before* Silk Road.  So you'd think they would have said something about Gox by now if they indeed seized BTC

That's fine and I'm sure he's very knowledgable on bitcoin and programming, I wasn't sure who he was.

Seems to me like they are all but eliminating international accounts in an effort to show the PBOC they are working to stop the use of BTC to get around capital controls.  But there is also the matter of the PBOC's efforts to protect the banking system, which has been one of their goals all along when the prevented banks from dealing with bitcoin altogether back in December.

This is misleading.   tweeted yesterday that he'd have some information on 3 potential buyers of MtGox, which he still hasn't followed through on.  TwoBitIdiot's document today claims


On Twitter


So TwoBitIdiot is trying to figure out why  hasn't released his information on the 3 potential buyers yet, since everyone Gox approached has reported them to the authorities.

Assuming the leaked recording of Karpeles' meeting with Mizuho bank was legitimate, the timing of all this is also suspicious; their bank had just notified them their accounts would be closed.  Gox already had issues with their banking, that meeting would have been the nail in the coffin.

I don't think you are reading between the lines.  itBit aren't stupid, they know that Singapore is the second most business friendly country to operate after HK.  But they are banking on regulation coming out of NY.  Obviously the US would be a better market, *if* there were regulation for exchanges.  ItBit have already built a name for themselves, it only makes sense if you knew regulation was coming to hop over to the better market.

Article raises some good points about ACH and PayPal targeting the right demographic using bitcoin.  I have another thought; companies are trying to figure out mobile payments but are faced with a chicken and egg dilema; how do you get customers to use it if merchants are not accepting cashless payments; and how do you get merchants to accept mobile payments if customers aren't using them. 
Circle, Coinbase, and potentially PayPal could tap in to a sizeable amount of customers already using a form of mobile payment (over 1 million bitcoin wallets on Coinbase alone), and therefore approach merchants with a good base of customers that could build the foundation of a solid mobile payment product.  To me, this is the business model Circle is focused on, as with Coinbase, and I suspect PayPal and others are wathing this very closely and would just swoop in and acquire one of these guys, if bitcoin continues to grow in popularity.

This news came out yesterday (14+ hours ago) so people reacted then.  Huobi basically said they hadn't heard anything from banks or the PBOC, and that all they have heard is what the media are reporting.  They did not halt all deposits, just vouchers.

You wouldn't really have to worry about mining fees if you are trading on an exchange.  I assume you work for a trading firm who are already used to spreads and commissions in forex/stock markets, and exchange fees when trading bitcoin would be similar to those markets.  
There are a plethora of HFT and other trading-oriented exchanges/platforms opening up, and I assume are gearing up to handle volume in the $MM range.

But the numbers don't add up.  750,000 (customer) BTC @ market price is around $450 million.  Even if pricing BTC at Gox price of $135 that's over $100 million.  They are saying it is only $65 million, so there is something wrong there.

You really have no substance here whatsoever, aside from completely speculative accusations.  I hope you can clarify a few things.  


I've never seen Bitstamp do any marketing, what makes you think Bitstamp does a better job of marketing than Bitfinex?  Just because you hear occasionally the name Bitstamp on the news their marketing is somehow better? Bitcoin traders do not flock to one exchange or another because they heard about it on CNBC.  Bitfinex clearly wins on features alone.  More than enough to win over traders from Bitstamp and elsewhere


"Whales" trade on each and every exchange.  There is no reason for "whales" as you call them to move everything to Bitfinex over Stamp.  And how could you possibly know this?


This doesn't really make sense, at least I don't understand what you are trying to get at here.  Bitfinex and Bitstamp both have decent liquidity, at least compared to other markets.  


So?  They provided their most recent audit.  And then followed up by performing another audit in May.  Good for them.  They didn't have to do that, in fact in no other industry would a private company publicly provide such information.  


I personally have still yet to see anything unreasonable.  The posts I've read include people trying to withdraw funds from outside their normal country/using multiple IP addresses, or withdrawing/depositing large amounts suddenly, and usually involve some sort of confrontational attitude towards bitstamp support.  You know what I'd do in that situation?  I'd tell my support staff to tell the customer to provide a blood sample, palm print, and rectal scan in order to be verified to withdraw funds (take the hint - we don't want rude, belligerent customers who do suspicious deposits/withdrawals from random IP addresses)


And Bitfinex has publicly stated they are no longer arbitraging between them and Bitstamp and hence the prices are beginning to diverge.  Bitfinex has also stated that because they are location in China, they are following more closely with Chinese prices.  Hmmm. 


Now this I have big issue with.  I am on regularly, and have not seen any sort of issues with bitstamp BTC withdrawals.  Provide some proof or GTFO. 
Finally, your little sales pitch for Bitifinex in the third to final paragraph (even though you claim it is not a sales pitch, but follow it up by stroking them and further bashing bitstamp) tells me you are full of shit.  
So, I ask you, to please provide further evidence of your claims, including BTC withdrawal issues, legitimate KYC issues, etc. otherwise you are just a FUDster.

Brilliant.  This should be the next move of Stamp, Kraken, VOS, et al.
Perhaps the Bitcoin Foundation could establish a set of best practices and give a "seal of approval" so to speak to exchanges and other bitcoin related entities to encourage adoption of such practices. I bet one if the newer exchanges would jump on the opportunity to stick that on their site which would force competitors to follow suit.

So what you are saying is the risk of using an anonymous exchange is outweighed by the fact that you don't have to supply a couple of documents and wait a few days for account verification?  And they are anonymous simply for the convenience of customers not to have to provide AML and KYC documentation?
