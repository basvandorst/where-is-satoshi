Just happened to be printing our own business cards today. I think ours came out much better.

The currency of SL is still Linden, but that doesn't preclude the concert organizers from having offered to pay her in Bitcoin.

Title is editorialized, the linked article never mentions the word proof. 
The author's argument that MtGox couldn't have lost ~750,000 coins boils down to "I know where my money is, and so should they." That's not an argument worth listening to.

You articulated precisely what is bothering me about this system. Sure it all sounds well thought out and feasible, not surprising with a published Chess Genius at the keyboard. But the barrier to entry is too damn high. 
Looking at it from a human perspective: Say I'm a starving artist tech hipster who wants to use BlackHalo for art commission contracts. I value the work at $150, the client agrees. Now I have to put my own money on the line - I don't have $150 to put into escrow, I'm investing my time, that's my escrow.
Just seems like such a non-starter for small parties, which is where the real growth lies.

Yeah, 268 was a quick back of the napkin calculation. It'll honestly be much longer than that.

I just did the math on my rig, 268 days until the payout threshold is hit.

Then as a suggestions - if those aren't your words, remove them. I would much rather see Your words written in Your own way. 
That website is the Only face of your company most people will Ever see. And that face is literally ripped from someone else's. That leaves your company with no personality, no soul - nothing. Just another nameless service with no accountability to anyone. 
My suggestion - write your own words in your own language and hire someone to translate them to english. Then you at least have something that is your own.

It will take about 2 years at Constant Difficulty and current exchange rate to make $8000 with your Little Single.
But taking real world data into account, by February 2014 you will be losing money to electricity costs. Enjoy.

Indeed. My condolences. I got mine in July, paid way too much for them. I haven't made a profit, but I have mined a couple coin. Given the recent BTC increase I might actually realize ROI.

How can you be the World's Best anything when you just opened for business and have a total of 6 jobs posted?

I apologize for coming on a bit strong, it's been an interesting day for me. But the lesson remains - make an identity for yourself or you will be forgettable. And forgettable is a pretty bad trait for a business.

My problem is I have the resources to do what you have, but I have to draw the line somewhere. The quest for giga-hashes is addicting.

Perhaps you missed the last point I made - you are saying Customers Can and Cannot run IRC Servers on two different pages. This would lead to customer confusion.

Throwing my hat in. I would devote my free hours to the right project, and happily accept btc in return.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:20:49
This is a realistic schedule of what you'll make, minus BTC value increases. Feel free to tweak the numbers and lose all hope.

A quick business is a dead business.
I am 100% in your target demographic - I have a need for a dedicated or shared remote hosting solution, I love bitcoin, etc. But when I view that website, the feelings I get are that it is fly-by-night, not going to be here tomorrow, and inexperienced. 
You have to build trust, and you cannot build trust if you've stolen the words used to describe your company. 
And another issue with stealing content - you can send mixed messages. I see on your [Policy page]( that 
    
    "Customers can't host TOR servers and IRC servers." 
Yet, on your [Shell Account page]( you list 
    "You can run IRC servers, IRC Bots, Bouncers, or another server applications".
So which is it? I'm not actually looking for an answer because it doesn't matter to me, but if you want to be a serious business, that Should matter to you.

The miner's reward of 25 btc is created by the miner forming the block. They add a transaction to the block sending the 25 btc to an address of their choosing.

What's awesome is we'll all be able to track precisely where those coins go. Likely nowhere, but who knows.

Not to distract from Mr. Lyric's humorous response, these appear to be the "Your daily reward" graph from Slush's pool.

Absolutely not - PayPal payments can easily be reversed for the flimsiest of reasons.

If you think sending bitcoins from your address to someone else's seems wild-west then you may want to rethink your use of bitcoin, as that is precisely how it works.

Sorry, I don't mean to be a debby-downer but spending $500 to get one free movie (concession not included) does Not sound like a very enticing promotion.

Can you explain why your About Us page plagiarizes straight from ServerBeach.com ?
In fact, most every sentence in your FAQ, Resources and Contact Form are lifted from multiple websites. Do you have anything original to offer? This causes me to have zero faith in your company if you can't even come up with your own copy.

ASICs will not kill the currency. ASICs will change the landscape with regards to mining and profitability - but Bitcoins are not just about mining. The real value is in people using them for day to day activities and purchases. Mining and the Market are very separate things.

Please understand I am not taking the time to type all this out because I dislike you or your business. I honestly wish you well. But I have seen these mistakes made so many times that I would be remiss to not point out the obvious issues with your new offering.
Good luck.
