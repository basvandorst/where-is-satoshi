There's literally no use for anything like this. People have said it could be used as an alternative to CAPTCHA, but then you can either do one response a day with a phone or make a million responses in a few seconds with a normal ASIC. Authentication doesn't need Bitcoin, a block chain, mining, or any sort of custom chip. Voting is the same, and just needs authentication not anything Bitcoin related. The only reason this exists is that the 21e6 mining operation wasn't that profitable anymore with their hardware so they needed something else to piss away VC money with.

They have hardcoded their mining split of 75% into the silicon. The end user has zero control except for where their 25% goes. People could make alternate pools that service up the right 75% split work, but who would bother? Nobody is going to make any money ever from this, other than 21. 
**If you have a device that is subsidized by a 21 chip the only way you can end up ahead is to turn it off.**
Rather than AdBlock, 21Block. Get your shit for free and make it not need a small power station to run. Awesome.

How exactly? They're not going to waste die space doing encryption or anything. The value added is the Bitcoin it mines, which is nothing, which is why this whole thing is just stupid.

Like what, exactly?

Mesh networking has about as much to do with Bitcoin as it does a jet powered furby.

No it's pretty unlikely that they have the two orders of magnitude efficiency gain needed to make this even slightly sane. All of the gains so far in mining have just been by shoving the devices into a smaller process size, and there's not really much smaller past the current 20nm.

You know that mobile phones have been around longer than this decade right? I was talking about the concept, not that I actually had a mobile phone at the time. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 02:04:26
I doubt it. There's not that much further to go in terms of process size from current generations of ASIC miners, and if they had some magical decrease in power they would have put the chips into their farm and made bank rather than trying to get other people to pay for the power bills. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:28:11


They have had a mining farm for years now. 


Yes, baked into the silicon. You pay all the power bills, they get the lions share of the profit.


0.01 BTC for a device in a router or phone like they propose is just plain stupid, especially given the reward will be halving in a years time. 


Venture capital burning a bright flame.
The whole thing is completely moronic and they do little to try and justify it. Their power bill for mining got too big and now they want someone else to pay for it instead. That's all that is going on here. Even with the most optimal math possible and rose tinted glasses this just ends up with lots of people paying ludicrous power bills for the benefit of some other company. Not decentralization, not internet of things bullshit, nothing.

I justified the 1995 internet phone to you. I would have wanted to access newsgroups on them.

All the people that invested in pets.com must have been pretty smart then, they threw even more money at that! 
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:06:13


Why? If they put a value on the BTC mined higher than it is worth, then you can just pretend to be mining it and cash out on their dollar. The dollar amounts for cost/profit are off by like an order of magnitude, and that's not even including the 2016 reward halving. 


It might just be locked to the coinbase output by the sounds of things, which is interesting from an economics view. Lots of people with lots of hashpower but only 25% income. They have a massive incentive to do finney attacks and force double spend reorganisations to turn a profit.  
Remember that Stratum isn't authenticated too. If you owned a mobile provider and you had 10% of the network hashing on devices you control the pipes of, you can effortlessly take all of that hashpower and use it to mine whatever blocks you want. People will say that would never happen, but ghash.io would never double spend against BetCoin dice for their own profit would they? Oh wait that did happen, never mind.

Problem with that is that the fax machine actually has a describable function that doesn't involve hemmoraging money into your power bill. Come up with even a single sensible use for "/dev/bitcoin" making millionths of a cent every year and maybe you can argue that point.

There's never going to be a point of having your router transact on the network. You're sitting here with a jet engine powered furby and yelling at me that it is going to be the future. I absolutely would have jumped on the idea of having mobile internet in 1995, dialup was a massive pain in the ass when you wanted to go to a hotel. 
"newsgroups on a train"
That's an answer I could have given you in 1995. 
Now, what can you give me for a blue sky justification for a router needing to be able to mine its own bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-20 01:05:05


Sure, so I just use different hardware and mine on their pool, how would they know the difference? I get the greater than BTC value reward, and 21co goes bankrupt. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 02:24:17


If they did, why aren't they just mining with them and making bank? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 06:46:44
The concept would have actually been a mobile phone I could use to dial in with, but that's beside the point.

Their diagram doesn't actually make sense on that level. They show it mining blocks with 75% hardcoded to them and 25% to the user, only they can't mine blocks because nobody would ever solve one in all likelyhood. You've touched on a critical issue though, which is that if there were millions of devices with penny shaving outputs the UTXO size would be in the terabytes and Bitcoin would be dead.


You can add addresses up to the maximum transaction size, which is also the maximum block size. Each additional output is 34 bytes, which means that they could have something like 30000 outputs in the generation transaction, with no room for other transactions in the block at all.
