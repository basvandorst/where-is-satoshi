Some funny quotes in this section 
 - Clearly I’d be richer
 - I got like a hundred bucks worth ... it means nothing
 - Clearly I don’t need the money

Yeah, both is the obvious strategy here. Even if BTC goes to the moon and replaces all fiat currency, stocks will still have value and will continue to be important.

We will see in a few days.

It seems like the typical scam that we hear about here often. Nothing seems high effort here.

I think in general you want to be careful posting too much stuff to reddit on the same acct. I have another account where you could pretty easily figure out who I am. That was my first account. I created this one and don’t post anything here that can be used to easily figure out who I am. In your case, I see you have +100k karma and a bunch of posts and comments. I think the problem is a blown out of proportion in this sub, but it’s always better to be safe than sorry. In my case, I created this account so that none of my comments/posts can be tied to who I am so there is no potential negative effect on my employment. 
To answer your question, one concern would be if BTC goes to the moon, can someone use your Reddit history to figure out who you are? If so, then you may be a target.

It doesn’t make sense to say BTC will be $1M USD and paper money goes away. If the USD goes away than $1M USD is worthless.

You’re talking about developers who work at real software companies. I work at one of those companies as well. You have to remember that a lot (most likely most) developers work at non-software companies, think financial companies, retail, etc. From what I’ve seen these companies don’t value developers correctly, and they believe all developers are equal. These companies are not paying a fresh college grad 150k. Most get well below $100k.

I’m not sure, you probably know more about it than I do.

The iOS app BitScreener does exactly this. I'm not sure if there is an Android version.
You create a "portfolio" where you enter the assets that you have. You can even enter them as individual buy/sell transactions. With this you can see profit/loss stats on each buy, The app is not tied to any actual assets, it just knows what you input for your assets.

Shit I hope so. I bought some at a higher price than that.
