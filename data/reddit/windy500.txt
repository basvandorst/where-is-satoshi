Forget Earth, Bitcoin will one day be the universal currency of the galaxy, everyone owning that little .0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001.
Buy Bitcoin today, be a God tomorrow.

I'm studying to be a network engineer, trading is just a past time whilst i sit in front of the desktop. Bitcoin however ive been trading since 2017. When you've been watching something crazy like Bitcoin for this long you develop a sense for how the market will move. 
It of course it all comes down to the whales, think of the big guys/financial institutions that want to make money off poor little you and me. Personally i think it will always be a store of value and that if you have coins the best thing to do is just hold or what some call hodl.
Up 5.43% today, see i could be wrong about my re-buy.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:16:41
Also please don't take this as advice, i could be entirely wrong. It's crypto for gods sake.

That was a great read, thanks Chaka42.
I also like how he broke down De Vries view on Visa compared to Bitcoin.

I like your vision, my current holdings warrant applying for a Bitcoin card. Back to OP: Been in the game for a while, it's super volatile, ive made some mistakes trading off the dips and highs but overall my volume of Bitcoin has increased. I sold on the high a few days ago and my next buy order is at between £6,100 or £6,500.

Stop being naive Mike, the whale is looking to screw me and you out of our money. On a side note what a day to have done some margin trading.
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:36:28
Well i guess it's finally time to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-05-01 22:31:01
Interested in holding some long term bitcoin, it''ll be tricky finding a good price between now and July. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:01:17
I got suckered in at £13K myself, lost about £700.00 gbp. Started trading some alt's and pump schemes, overall my volume of Bitcoin is allot more than i started but all that hardwork for nothing. If Ripple were to ever get listed on coinbase, that would be the day i can say crypto's paid off for me. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:02:41
Hodl strong there buddy!

Does anyone know the exact meeting date of the G20 June-July summary? 
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:57:00
On the down trend until end of June-July guys, look for that low price to jump in on.

It's annoying to see people professionally try and speculate on what causes the price to go up and down. Use a little common sense, ignore cointelegraph, forbes and nonsense youtubers. Something like Bitcoin doesn't just become valuable to likes of $6,454.00 for no reason at all. It has real use in the blackmarket and makes payments in today’s economy easier for businesses, persons &amp; governments.
Scenario's that affect it's trading cycle are the following:
\- Rival Coins &amp; Technology
\- Adoption
\- "Laws" &amp; "Regulation" (This being the most important one!)
I'll put the current price drop all down to the scheduled EU re-meet for the end of this month, were likely to see the price drop down even further leading upto the last week of June when it's discussed on an international level. If you truly followed Bitcoin and "believed" in it, you would have realised this and sold on the last high of £7,100 and would be waiting buy back in at this time. Most professional Bitcoin traders knew the price would fall in mid June-July. Wait for it folks, i'd say £4,500 would be safe price to go in at but i have my alert set at £4,200. Keep dedicating time to understanding it all, everything involving money is linked together.

All the bigger investors are putting their hedge funds in asset based stocks until an international committee has published it report. Even if I miss out on the crash or just simply decide to wait, i'll be buying in after the 1st week of July regardless, safer bet.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:18:30
You can ignore most of the previous comments, if you were a real bitcoin follower you would have cashed out on $9,000.00 and would be waiting to buy back in now, my alerts set for $5,570.00, everyone that genuinely has an interest in the use of bitcoin knew that a crash would happen in-between the months of June - &amp; the 1st week of July. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:06:37
My post is based in the information in your link, justified speculation vs randomly analysing price increases and decreases throughout it's conception. Graph analysis in crypto doesn’t quite work in the way it does for actual asset based stocks. No need to get offended, it's just my two cents... or maybe your one of those assholes that likes to market his lame his predictions through fake accounts. Now you can get offended. :)

The G20 meeting "itself" is FUD, i express that in wholesome manner. 
I'm sure dictatorship and communist regimes like Russia &amp; China are able to ban crypto's outright. We in the western and democratic free world will never ban cryptocurrencies, or atleast i hope not, you wouldn't be able to say you live in a democracy otherwise.
Some of these so called coins are country funded, you see what Venezula tried to do?

Agree with this analysis, I doo...
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:18:42
*Disclaimer* (Pure Speculation) 
I'd like to say it's gonna crash a little further, maybe down to £5500GBP and a rebound after. Honestly we don't know though, that MT.Gox trustee has burned us, wouldn't be suprised if theirs a bounty on his head.

All this talk about Hodling, am i the only one trading the high &amp; lows of each day? £200 bones easy. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:15:58
It’s a zero sum game, although i’d like to say it’s currently underpriced, can’t wait till Stripe start accepting Bitcoin again. They’ll do it at a time that’s good for them. I think we’ll hit an all time low for this month today or tomorrow. I’d buy in again at £5-6000gbp.

I like this post.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:15:01
It's doubled since the crash, you should expect for the price to fall further so people can cash out profits and new investors can enter the market. I'll consider buying in at around £6-7K GBP. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:58:53
Tempted to buy ;)

To add im very much looking forward to John Mcafee eating his own dick live on television, year 2020. That alone is almost worth the £2000,00 i reinvested at 10K.

Would say it's not hard to see a continuation of the down trend, atleast up until June, at which point BTC will start rallying, maybe even before the world summit review. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:35:27
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:50:22
Same thing happened to allot of us, just increase your volume of BTC via alts in the mean time.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:38:04
Fomo's a good indicator, and yep that could be the price. It might be possible to make some gains on $6,4/$6,300.

"A name that stands out is that of the legendary investor George Soros. Bloomberg’s sources confirmed that Adam Fisher, the person in charge of global macroeconomic investing at Soros Fund Management, has received the green signal to proceed with cryptocurrency investing."
Another very prominent investor to enter into the crypto world is the Rockefeller family, through their official venture capital arm Venrock.
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:44:16
Arguing about trends?, the trend right now is that Bitcoin's future is undecided until June. At current hedge fund managers are probably steering away from buying any Bitcoin until they know more information leading upto that point. Chances are they'll just re-iterate what they've said in the previous summit, look for a rock bottom price to buy in at, after June we should be heading back to the moon. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:45:46
Looks like were about to take back $9000 &amp; £7000. Congratulations people!
