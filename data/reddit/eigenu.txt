Obviously 0-conf transactions have issues, but you are completely twisting the issue, and twisting Satoshi's words to suit your agenda.  Satoshi said that 0-conf transactions could be accepted by payment processors in the future:


I think this post by btcdrak could be classified as a dirty trick.  Taking small shred of truth and completely using it to persuade the ignorant.  Its a very effective form of propaganda for newer people who do not know what is going on, or never read Satoshi's quotes.

Woah, lets not get too carried away.  What Satoshi said in that quote is true, but also it is very clear from his other quotes that he expected in the future for their to be methods evolved to accept 0-conf transactions:


Sure 0-conf txs have their issues, but they are also able to be accepted and newer technology is always coming out to make 0-conf's more safe.  This RBF change will severely hamper those advancements, and make it so 0-conf is not as viable in the future.
