The underlying that bitcoin fee itself is that high.

Because the majority of the code is the same. The block size is really relevant and a big thing but the project is otherwise the same.

That's true but a Ubuntu based distribution with small changes is called Xubuntu. 
If something is based on something else giving it a similar name makes sense. Chocolate ice cream -&gt; Vanille ice cream.

It's about the change of the desktop environment. Xubuntu and Ubuntu are similar but not the same. 
Just like bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

It's a hard fork. Breaking census is not a valid argument. Bitcoin cash is similar to bitcoin. They are trying to improve the usability of bitcoin but don't change the whole concept. Keeping the block chain is a logical part of doing so.

A desktop envoirment is a significant part of an OS.
But that's not what we should be discussing here. I used my example to emphasize that bitcoin and bitcoin cash are similar and even based on the same blockchain. Therefor calling it similarly is a logical think to do.

Should they fork then they think that they cant improve a software?
Thinking that you can change it for the better is the point of forking.

Think about what I want to explain with the comparison. A fork can use a name similar to the forked software.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:31:02
Newbies could get confused but that is not a valid reason to misuse a different name. If the forker decided to call the fork "bitcoin cash" than thats the name that should be used. Manipulating a name is wrong and disrespectful against the creators.

Isn't forking a FOSS if you have an idea to improve it good? 
If someone wants to improve bitcoin and he forks the project to solve a problem there is no reason to be against it.

As I already explained using the same name root makes sense because the fork is similar and has the intention to fix a flaw (the high fees) in bitcoin. Giving it a similar names is something logical to do.

But how many people benefit from a technology which causes the already insanely high bitcoin transaction fee to tripple? 
It's nice that they implement that but just a minority will be able to use it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:23:22
That sounds like a reason to use monero lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:00:42
If you are paying with ethereum the fee is under 1 penny. That's revolutionary. 
That's useable for every transaction even paying a friend but paying 10+ $ is way to high for most transaction like with your example.

I think that you should disclose that you are recommending your own site.
