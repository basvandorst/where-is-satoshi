i'm not really bitcoin savvy, but in order to achieve 7 mil transactions would blocks need to be a terabyte each? adding a terabyte to the blockchain every 10 minutes?
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:13:38
i came here to get a down and dirty look at the mentality of the bitcoin community in regards to doge. i want ALL cryptos to succeed. it is a mutual interest. YOU are the problem that bitcoin is having. YOU are the reason doge is "more friendly" because when compared to the above diatribe dogecoin looks like a godsend. now stuff your bitcoin up your ass. for the rest of the civilized bitcoin community, we need to work together to push crypto as far as we can and this douchebag's attitude is doing none of us any good.

thanks for answering my questions and not calling me a silly kid with a worthless meme coin. much respect.

balls deep. and you will like it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:25:08
is that like trix are for kids ? Haha did t even think of that
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:33:34
WHAT!? okay everybody, gather round i want to tell you something. "spread it around" means money laundering. christ you are a lying sack of shit and a horribly idiotic troll.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:14:04

you're rubber im glue. just gonna repeat what i write back to me? yeah thought so. retard.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:19:47
yikes you are a dummy.
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:06:59
look all the name calling and other bullshit aside. man to man. you know and i know that none of that means money laundering. i mean i'm not really sure how to get that point across to you. you don't want to acknowledge it even though we both know it. i'm not really sure how re-posting the same irrelevant bullshit makes any sense. you ain't got no proof buddy. i'm sorry that you don't, i would have liked to have seen it. whats worse is you think "stealing from the rich and giving to the poor" is money laundering. you may want to read the work of fiction and then take a spin over to wikipedia to look up laundering and make some comparisons. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:31:08
how does that work? does it work on the honor system? im genuinely curious.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:42:25
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:21:20
so you are saying you have absolutely no proof of anything and what you said was completely false. correct? i thought so. keep spinning fairy tales.

he convinced a holding company Torihiki LTD to go in on it with him. he owned 48% of the shares. Had an Agreement to run operations for them. hence the full control. Torihiki is no longer involved with mintpal.

i think that you guys should come together to get the mods to ban the word dogecoin. you guys don't even want it to be so much as mentioned so just ban it. It doesn't exist in your world. we get it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:40:59
speaking of taking things too seriously....0.o
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:48:07

@_date: 2014-03-18 04:15:01

i don't know what the fuck you are talking about. you sound like a god damn 12 year old. you cocksuckers wanna talk shit, then don't be surprised when we talk shit. the more shit you talk the worse you look and the dumber you sound. you want dogecoin banned from bitcoin then fucking ban it. cry like a little baby about it.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:34:12

your proof is not present. pure speculation. i understand the interpretation you are using. but its just that isn't it? your interpretation. you have no proof. who is the troll here? its clearly you.

i love guys who call people "little shit". much tough. very guy.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:56:01
fair enough. do you think having a popular altcoin like doge who is heavily into marketing itself has helped bitcoin popularity and crypto currency as a whole or do you think dogecoin doing things like the NASCAR race and bobsled team and other marketing efforts has been detrimental to cryptocurrency and bitcoin specifically?
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:13:08
i see the jimmies have been rustled again. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:43:26
you show respect and i will. its really that simple. now provide the proof of money laundering and stop dancing around it with bullshit. i never said the guy was innocent or guilty. i even said i would apologize if what you are saying is true. but we both know you cant prove a fucking thing don't we? just running that mouth of yours. whats the matter do people usually let you get away with this stupid shit?
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:55:32
its crazy. people giving to other people. crazy
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:36:20

you wouldn't want to try and copy doge would you ;)
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:49:03
where did money laundering enter your mind? i need to know. im speaking to you like an adult and im asking you straight. where do you get off saying someone is laundering money? what. is. your. proof? please provide it. if the person is laundering money we want him gone, i can assure you that, so you would be doing us a favor. please show me where and how this money was laundered. be a man and stop dancing around the question i am asking you. as for me not having the gall to talk to someones face. save it scaredy cat. you want me to kiss your ass i will. in exchange for proof of the shit you are talking. now. provide it or you embarrass yourself and look like a fool. im waiting. dont run. dont hide. don't pretend we are in the street fist fighting. we are not. back up what you said.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:46:28
can't even read a simple chart and you have the balls to pretend to know what you are talking about. you are arguably the dumbest motherfucker I've ever encountered. I have you the facts and you choose to ignore it. you are a buffoon acting like a genius. Keep burying your head in the sand. you may want to read up on crypto currency before you open your stupid mouth. you sound like a fool.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:40:33
am i spamming ? i addressed your attitude specifically. nobody likes spamming and if im spamming then by all means give me a good thrashing. check my post history if you like this is my first post in this sub. the point of my post was not to put bitcoin down and it was not to promote doge it was to say a little harmony between the two is a good thing for both of us. pull your fucking tampon out and be an adult. Dogecoin was mentioned in the OP so i would like to comment on it. should i subscribe so you feel better about it? suck it up. i got my doge by buying BTC so believe it or not we are from the same tribe. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:29:40
did he use the words laundering? i must have missed that you imbecile. if i did miss that would you kindly link me to it so i may apologize to you. you lying sack of shit. i'm waiting.
@_date: 2014-05-20 02:07:16
if it makes you feel better the bitcoin one is on there so you guys didn't get jealous.

@_date: 2014-03-18 04:56:45
oh look at the tough guy. are you threatening me? chances are you would lie about your address just like every other word that comes out of your mouth. pussy. i didn't come to fist fight. i came to make people like you look stupid. and the beauty is i didn't have to do much but let you speak. fucking embarrassment to your "community". go to sleep baby boy. dream up some more lies. see this shit shibes? this guy gets called out on his lies and now resorts to trying to start a fight in real life. push back.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:20:49

@_date: 2014-03-17 20:35:26
i'm sick of being called stupid. and you are in no position to tell me what is appropriate when i'm being called immature and stupid. and i sincerely don't give a shit if you like it or not. i'm not supporting dogecoin. i'm poking an asshole with a stick.

to play devils advocate i used BTC to get doge. so in my case the gateway was BTC. and that's nothing against BTC just a preference in a currency. BTC is still the big dog.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:59:35

@_date: 2014-05-11 21:31:58
so there is something wrong with supporting a coin as you do here for bitcoin? why do you think so many are flocking to doge instead of lets say rubycoin or one of the other alts? all altcoins are clones correct? so why does doge get so much attention even though its not really different? 
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:20:49
nobody is forcing anyone to tip though. and we are not tipping for no reason. so your entire thought process on the matter is fundamentally flawed. what exactly is "out of character activity"?
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:38:36
you know its funny, we have done nothing but extend the olive branch in friendship and you spit in our faces at every turn. if you want to be then that's how you will be treated. like the arrogant frat boys you act like. now go back to sucking each others dicks. i have better things to do than argue with an idiot that sounds like a broken record.
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:56:44
i think we could make that happen. but it might be a little late for the upcoming race. Next one!
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:53:09
no it isn't. wtf are you talking about? Did you even read it?
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:00:06
i didn't threaten you in desperation. you did. i'm perfectly fine with being civil. as long as someone isn't blatantly lying through his fucking teeth. next your going to tell me Metallica are murderers because of a song lyric. fuck that noise. your slandering people. "i think dogecoin is going to go down 15% in two days" yeah.... well.... you think a lot of things. none of which seem to be reality.

@_date: 2014-03-18 04:18:15
i don't know what that means. is there a financial statement i can scrutinize or are you literally talking out of your asshole? because it seems clear you are talking out of your asshole. and honestly i don't think you want to have a discussion about using crypto for nefarious purposes.
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:12:59
its from a fiction book you fucking neanderthal. don't worry i won't respond again. ill move on the next frat boy with half a bitcoin who thinks hes hot shit. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:34:28
seems to work really well for the vendors who accept dogecoin. does this variance also affect the bitcoin 10 minute block causing it to take longer for confirmations? im not super familiar with this variance.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:30:33
where do you think a stupid 11 year old kid wearing a barney suit would land on this list?
im guessing you wouldn't think top 5. i'm guessing you wouldn't think number 3 in 24 hour volume. is it possible that this stupid 11 year old kid wearing a barney suit is slightly more legitimate than you are willing to give credit? is it the dog on the coin that makes you think that having a higher trading volume than 95% of all altcoins is insignificant? clearly there are people out there who want to own and trade doge so why is it so easy for you to just write it off as stupid and immature?
@_date: 2014-08-22 19:27:00
how do you promote a dead alt coin?
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:55:15
thanks to all the bitcoiners that helped out with this one. as foxy said we really do appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:44:30
you lost me at flawed logic. try this for logic. someone states something as fact. i ask for proof. now read carefully because i don't want you to misinterpret anything. ok again. someone states something as fact. i respond by asking for proof. no logic involved really. so before you attempt to take some pseudo intellectual high ground let me just stop you right there. i don't give a flying fuck what you are saying and you can stuff your words directly up your ass. unless of course you have proof of money laundering in which case im all ears.

 publicity for doge is publicity for bitcoin and evidently people want to talk about it. I suggest you petition the mods to ban it
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:28:55
i looked at your frontpage. trust me nobody is taking over Honestly, if it breeds the type of hatred that i'm seeing then nobody should post over here and i will be happy to take that message back to the shibes in any way that i can. Maybe bitcoin and doge don't play well together and sometime in the future we can all have this discussion again once doge gains more legitimacy in eyes. we don't need to spam anybody and frankly we dont need bitcoins approval to succeed. time will tell if we are a jokecoin spamming cult.
