Do you have some kind of source for that statement? Not that I don't believe you, but I want to be sure!

Being curious may be strange to understand I guess.

Thanks for the answer.
Don't you think this is quite a big flaw? Having forever growing amount of held BTC makes analysis less and less precise overtime...
Do we have some stats about the amount of "lost BTC"?

I got a technical question about deleted BTC and Blockchain. Didn't find any answer in any FAQ/documentation.
When BTC is "lost" (HDD destroyed for example) there is no way to recover your loss if there is no physical copy of that data, fine.
However, I wonder how the Blockchain reacts to that event.
1. Are the BTC detected as destroyed?
2. Are the BTC still in the chain in a ghost state (always held, never sold)?
3. Is there a "cleanup" process of the Blockchain to remove ghosts?
Btw, I do not ask for what appens to the wallet, but for the chain itself. Having ghost BTC would be an everyday growing flaw leading to the falsification of the "real" value of BTC, and i find strange that i've never heard of that before (basically that's why I post here).

I'm not talking about the difference for the wallet, but for the chain. In your example, the national (or federal) bank that prints the money has **mathematical rules** to take that kind of losses in account, in order to always know approximately the real amount of money **available**.
