Usually importing a wallet.dat adds all private keys from the old wallet to the new one. In any case, as I am reading that in Electrum you can’t do that if the Electrum wallet does not have a seed, I suspect the Electrum wallet is watch-only or it really does not have a seed, which is pretty bad. Do you have the 12 or 24 word list when you created the Electrum wallet? Edit: I AM NOT ASKING YOU TO POST THE LIST! I want to know if you have such list with you.

I remember reading that you should not just import the wallet.dat file, but export the wallet properly, then import. There is a specific export command for that.
Why are you using bitcoin core as a wallet? It probably is the less convenient way to store bitcoin. Even a mobile wallet like mycellium would be better.

I really like you.

"Nobody cares", very naive of you to think that

You must be trolling, no one is THAT stupid

It is the realization that it is a revolution. No fucking way 1 of a mere 21 million coins is only worth 10k, at a global economic scale it is a laughable price, and a steal. Not counting that there are not even 21 million in circulation yet. So the market thinks that all bitcoins are a mere 210 billion US$ at the current price? Sorry, but no. HODLing until the price makes some sense to me.
Let's put it this way, I would sell Bitcoin, today, at 25k, and pretty reluntanctly.

5K is very likely, looks about right. I am thinking about shorting some and re-buying at that level.

What he means I think is that you are buying a 4k bitcoin in one month, no matter the price at that moment. You have essentially locked 2k profit

BTC will inevitably go up because it is tremendously undervalued, no TA necessary here

What would be the price of mining in absolute terms?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:19
Yes! what sucks most is that it has affected everyone and all other market makers... I'm in bitcoin.de, which works wonderfully btw, and people hit the panic button all the same...

I don't use MtGox, but that didn't prevent their inaptitude from collapsing all other market makers... including the one I am using... they can not handle this liquidness

It's funny, they used to say the same thing about gold when it was around 600$ an ounce. The same people still had the nerve to keep that same "this is so obvious" message when it hit 1200$... keep saying something over and over, and eventually it will become true
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:43:52
why MtGox, WHY? I would rather a basket from several market makers
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:03:17
I sold my moxes back when they cost 100$... damn!
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:07:15
bitcoin.de is pretty much the only one I trust. Should be first on the list...
