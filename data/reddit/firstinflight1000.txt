I never said it is or isn't... just asking a question to see if someone can offer a different perspective.

Yeah, I agree.  I'm probably just overestimating a reasonable return.  I'm trying to make sense of the spike in price, but it is truly impossible to know exactly what the upper limit could be.

 Who gets to determine if/when A fork occurs?

You are right... in context of bitcoin, it can go much lower.  It's no fun to witness this either way though.

Thanks for the insight!  I'll try to find the article. :)

Its like a movie!!

Ha ha! True!

Hey my friend... it looks like we are quite close to that mark.  On GDAX it appears to be at around $5668 at the time of this writing.

THIS IS SPARTA!!!!!!!

Yes, I'm aware of the harsh dips... trust me, I'm ready.  But I think that we all want to get something in exchange of our time and effort to get the use of cryptocurrencies to be more widespread.  I'm just trying to put it all into some kind of good perspective with help from people like you.

This is not good advice.  If it goes below the price in which the BTC was purchase, then the better option is to sell.  Heck, I sold and will re-buy when it appears to have stabilized at a new bottom.  Then you don't lose anything.  Hodl is great for long term, but this isn't a freeking retirement fund (at least not yet).

I’ve been following BTC since 2013.  Just only recently had the balls to create a Reddit account. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:31:19
I don't know, I'm just trying to learn more about the perspective of the price from people like yourself.  What is your opinion? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:39:53
This is great insight... thank you.  I haven't thought of it this way before.  You are right.  If bitcoin was completely "flushed out" anyone would be able to walk into a trading firm and buy one "on the spot."  I'll keep this in mind for perspective!  Much appreciated!

It's all so crazy and complicated now.  Mt. Gox is going to look like the "Good ol' days".
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:06:22
It’s like a bad horror movie!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:29:15
Yeah, and I don't think you are the right person to be responding to this post.  I sure hope you aren't out there trying to promote Bitcoin (or anything for that matter) with your attitude.  Geeesh... can anyone pose a simple question around here?  
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:36:46
Great points here, thank you for writing this.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:37:55
This comment is awesome!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:22:52
I honestly don't know, which is why I am posting this question.  I do appreciate your response though.  Makes me feel a bit better knowing another "late" investor.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:47:57
I sure hope so :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:23:28
Don't be rude man, I'm just asking an honest question so I have more insight into this investment that I made.
