I understand where you're coming from, and I can see that happening. But the problem that I'm seeing is that it gives the miners too much control. If the net worth of mined coins plus fee decreases (due to price decline or a block halving), the miners will do whatever they can to stay profitable, and their self interest (miner profit) might not be aligned with the interest of the users of the network. 
In such a situation (decreasing miner profit) it might be best for the network to loose a couple of miners than to cripple the network, i.e. half the current bandwith (blocksize).
Even if a fee market kicks in, this could cripple existing services that run on the blockchain. Where every transaction used to go through, in a fee market transactions with a 'low' fee will inherently be stuck (atleast without replace by fee or something similar). This means that if the miners decide to half the bandwith, as much as half of all the transactions that got through easily before the halving will be stuck, resulting in crippled services and and user experience.

One of the best explanation I've seen. 
Have some creamer @_date: 2015-09-04 09:05:13
He is saying that on average a node needs to be able to upload a block to 8 peers within 30 seconds for proper propagation over the network.
Not that all nodes actually upload each block 8 times. A node that discovers the block early may upload it to 8+ peers. And nodes that discover the block relatively late may not have to upload it to any peers at all.

The big problem with BIP 100 as I see it is that it's unpredictable. How can an economic actor rely on the Bitcoin network if they don't know what the throughput of the network will be in a year (or 2, 3..)?
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:37:35


Care to name these networks?
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:46:23
That would be my guess as well, however:
* Segwit is an on-chain *efficiency increase*, not layer two.
* LN is nowhere near *about to launch*.
So were just left with sidechains, which afaik, face the same scaling problems as the *main chain*.
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:54:16
Most likely heavy volatility
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:22:06
Trust me, I read plenty. To my understanding the only *layer two* solutions that are being *developed* are side chains and LN, and as far as I know neither are ready to take a significant load of the network in the near term.
I can be wrong of course, in which case please tell me how your views/understanding differs from mine.
@_date: 2015-11-02 09:09:17
Im not arguing that the current system is broken and unsustainable.
Your point about how banks reap all the (huge) profits which we could be making if we invest the money ourselfs (which I guess is what you are saying) does not hold IMO.
The only reason why banks make these huge profits off of these loans is through fractional reserve banking (eg artificial wealth creation), in a bitcoin system these profits would seize to exist and thus will not be anyones to make.
Im not saying that these are just profits and that they should exist, but they are the 'skills' of the bank which are not possible to obtain in a bitcoin system by anyone.

I can talk about Bitcoin without actually using it.
@_date: 2015-11-02 17:23:09
Maybe im just too stuck in thinking in 'old system' terms..
Looking at our current situation it might be better for the ecosystem and longevity of the economic sustainability to not provide as much loans.
@_date: 2015-11-02 09:16:38
I get your point but how does this relate to my post? How will this insight help an aspiring business owner which has not enough 'medium of exchange' to start a business?
@_date: 2015-11-02 17:16:02


Im simply afraid that there would be too little incentive to provide such loans, given that in a bitcoin only system just holding on to your bitcoins has no risk but still yields returns.
Thank you for the detailed answer tho!
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:42:05
Why would they be banned?
I understand that you consider XT to be an altcoin, but that does not mean that someone who uses XT cannot contribute to discussions concerning Bitcoin.
I run an XT node, does that in itself warrant a ban from @_date: 2015-11-03 07:41:41


Not the desirability of a loan, but the incentive to provide one.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:31:54
1) I actually meant to offset deflation, because you should offer the investor something more than the appreciation in value due to deflation, otherwise it would be better to just hodl.
2) Fair point.

Thanks for the insights! $1.5
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:40:00
Thank you, I'll read up on that.
But the issues of a loan system in a deflationary bitcoin only econony remain do not change.
@_date: 2015-11-02 08:51:46
Not sure why you got downvoted, but this is precisely what I mean.
Im sure a Kickstarter type loan system would work for high risk high reward investments, but I cannot see how this could work for small business owners.
For example a guy wanting to start a small coffeshop in a town, sure it might be profitible enough for him to support his family, but I would not risk my bitcoins for such returns (which in cold storage are very safe and sure to accumilate in value).
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:25:18
Haha did the price actually drop 4 percent before changetip responded
@_date: 2015-11-01 22:00:17
Isabella Kaminski brought up an interesting point though, about how the money that you keep in the bank is being reinvested in the economy whereas this in a bitcoin only system where everybody is their own bank would not.
How could you make this work?
If I for example would lend my bitcoins to someone who wants to start a business, then his business would have to do really well if he wants to be able to pay me back as the value of these coins start appreciating over time (as they naturally would in a bitcoin only system). He would become my debt slave.
And if he would pay me back minus the appreciation in value, why would I lend him my bitcoins in the first place?
The only awnser I can think of is that you lend your bitcoins denominated in, lets say, USD, and the reason would be as a hedge against the bitcoin price.. but this would hardly be a deflationary bitcoin only system.

RemindMe! 1 year "Does ₿ look like a bitcoin symbol yet?"
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:49:54
Maybe this has been pointed out already, but another falscy is that the number of nodes will drop as the block size increases.
Whereas an increasing blocksize actually means that more people are using bitcoin, and if the same percentage of users run a full node, this actually means that the overall number of nodes would increase.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:36:44
By a bitcoin only system I actually mean an aconomy that only uses bitcoin some point from now. Where there is a lot more stability and the system is basically deflationary.

The economist would counter: "Gold is backed by its intrinsic value"
@_date: 2015-11-02 09:00:44
The problem with this system that I see is that these businesses combined would have to out perform the bitcoin price appreciation for two reasons:
1) To make it worthwhile for the investors that take a risk, why would they otherwise invest it? Out of altruism?
2) for the lenders to payback their loans to dont end up like the dept slaves that the current system creates.
Unless im missing something were back in a system that needs an unsustainable growth accumilation to support itself.

I simply asked you to name which layer two solutions you believe are *about to launch*, not explain what its about in all its technical glory.

@_date: 2015-11-02 09:38:51
This does not solve the scenario that I sketched where it becomes very hard for the borrower to pay back his loan because of the bitcoin value appreciation. If this would be just a few percent a year I guess this could work, but if this is a lot more then the system as I see it is once again creating debt slaves.
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:50:42
No, miners could simply forcefully lower the supply according to their interest (profit), their interest does not have to be aligned with that of the users (demand).

Has the actual tx been identified?
@_date: 2015-11-02 17:08:07
What im afraid of is that these systems only work because of the current volatility and uncertainty.
In a bitcoin only system I believe the volatility would be greatly reduced and replaced by a constant upward price pressure, then the incentive to provide a low risk low return loan would be gone. As holding is no risk and still yields returns.
