Dont ink ur skin with anything to do with Bitcoin. 
U have absolutly no idea where we are going.
If you want to promote bitcoin : [ is the safe place. Ink FIAT, NEWSPAPER etc... but not ur skin.

I've ordered 2 times and its totally legit, i'm not sure about the redistribution scheme tho \^\^

Thank this guy ! 
When you send Bitcoin's to theorically unspendable adresses, you give it to the whole network.
Its the same when you lost acces, you put more scarcity into the network and its a gift to all of us.
Donate to Satoshi !

We are far from being affraid of quantum computing attacks on the Bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin is about getting free.
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:43:54
Most of Assange jurist work for free.
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:46:31


Satoshi has to disappear, nothing to do with Assange.

Tldr : the employees voted for it.
Its not a Giant at all
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:18:14


Always try to use P2P exchange as the Satoshis are spreading all across the world we will not need the centralized exchanges. You have to buy bitcoin from another else. You have to re-pay ur debt in bitcoins too (small debt to friends for a meal or smthing)

@_date: 2019-04-13 20:32:11


Its not.
@_date: 2019-04-01 15:05:58

Why dont convert ur salary to bitcoin every month (like me) ?

@_date: 2019-04-13 20:14:47


What about the value of the dollar who constantly fall ? 
In ur mind 1USD is always 1USD
In my mind 1Satoshi is always 1Satoshi
we are both correct.
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:49:54
You can choose wich monetary policy u want to belive in.
The speculative part is normal and will shake out people who are here to speculate but not to build a new economy based on better monetary policy.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:33:38
Use tails.
