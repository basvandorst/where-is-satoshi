Thank you for good advice. I am hesitant but I'm going to wait. I didn't send btc as payment, i still have the coin. I guess now I am an investor.

I'm just frustrated. I guess I became an investor without the intention of being one.

I have calmed down. Still upset I lost money. I will hold on to coins in hopes that ill break even sometime.

I didn't send btc, because it would have been a full payment. I will hold on to the coins for a little while.
