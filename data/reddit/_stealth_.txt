buying and selling at a profit is still a profit, regardless of the amount you "could have" 
Buyin @ 24 selling at 5600, taking the same money and buying again at 12000 to sell at 20k is still profit in the longrun. Sure it would of been more, but profit is profit. 
I'm kicking myself for not putting in more at $5000 so I put more in at $10000.

yea, I sold off at 7700 
thinking of buying it again and make some profit. Might wait a few days and see where it goes. If it hits close to 6000 im going all in again

Sell High, Buy Low. 
Keep doing that and you'll make money.

same boat, tried to sign up and do $480 (max for new account) and it refused to verify my amounts. Kept telling me it was wrong, took a few weeks before it finally took.

Yea, I'm super confused. lets say I have 5 bitcoins currently, when the fork happens I still have 5 bitcoins and 5 bitcoin2x? 
Can I sell my 5 bitcoin2x and buy more bitcoins? I don't understand the point of the fork

how does one buy with gdax and how is it stored, right to your virtual wallet?  
Sorry, just got into the game with coinbase and I looked at gdax but got super overwhelmed lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:50:27
Im even more confused, which one is the currency. 
What if I had 5 bitcoins stored in cold storage off the market? Do I not  get 2x?
