Tor-Ex has some SERIOUS potential. My first experience with them however (and last until the fix it) left a lot to be desired.
After reading this post actually I decided to give Tor-Ex a try. I had bitcoins to unload anyway and I liked the sound of a closer to truly anonymous bitcoin experience. So I made an account and sent 3.41 btc over and proceeded to shit myself worrying if perhaps my excitement over this cash for btc idea had made me completely overlook the possibility of the whole thing just being a scam. Fortunately after a couple hours the transaction had enough confirmations and showed up in my new account. So far so good.
The next step was to trade. I typed in my info, and said that I had 3.41 btc that I was looking to sell for dollars in the United States. My order went through and almost immediately someone's sell cash order hit... Only problem is it was for .1 btc for 12 dollars. The rate didn't bother me, but .1 bitcoin wasn't even close to what I wanted to sell. 
So I investigate a little further and come to find out that the only open orders of people selling usd are synced up with the price of .1 btc. This clearly was not going to work for me  so I immediately cancelled my order before it continued to chop my order into 34 small ones. 
My problem with Tor-Ex is this. They did not state anywhere that they would be piece-mailing my order together. I understand other exchanges do this all the time but the difference here is that on Tor-Ex ever order for cash is another envelope filled with 12 dollars not to mention 34 times more fees than the one order I wanted would have been subjected to.(I understand it wouldn't literally be 34times more but they weren't cheap and breaking it into 34 is definitely more expensive.) So thankfully I was able to stop the flood of envelopes filled with cash from coming to my house where my mother lives at the moment.  (That would have been an awkward conversation.)
Anyway the one order went through and arrived today. I hit received and torex released the funds from escrow pretty much exactly how SR works. That part is cool. However if I were to have done all 34 there would be no way to distinguish one order from another nor anyway to know who ripped you off if that ended up happening. 
In closing, I would Use torex all day everyday if only they had some bigger players on their site. Idk if the small transactions  are because of them or just because no one is offering bigger purchases for bitcoin but either way Tor-Ex is not a viable bitcoin exchange until they fix this issue or attract some bigger fish. There's no reason why a 24 year old part-time employed bitcoin trader should be largest fish in their little anonymous cash for bitcoin pond.

Depending on your definition of sketchy blueskytraders are good too. Cash deposit straight to btc so u save a step from bitfloor

Anyone vets in here who have no issues with implanting wallets into small animals?
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:52:09
I've had transactions complete and been able to send btc to other wallets... Bought once as well. But ya. Coinbase is really in needs some fixing up.

At the end of the day they are the quickest, easiest, most convenient way to getting money into an exchange quick. I started with coinbase which was and still is ridiculous... Seemingly moreso each time I buy. More exchanges should run like bitfloor. No verification bullshit. No waiting. If you have an email address, Internet access, some cash, and a Bank of America reasonably close by than you can get bitcoine with what I mentioned being the only conditions you have to put up with. I just hope they manage to pay off the people from back when they got hacked. I know I'd be pisses to see them go under. With all this mtgox bullsht going on I HIGHlY recommend bitfloor to anyone looking to buy btc in the states. And avoid coinbase like the plague.... Though open an account with them anyway and verify an account just to have another option to cash out at if you find urself in a place when certain exchanges are having issues. Plan b is about all they're good for. Sorry for getting off topic. Bitfloor all day!

And if the account is cancelled altogether? I have a hard time believing an order to an account no longer in existence wouldn't be deemed high risk.

This is the email to get a quote for a deposit. They're usually very quick also.

Four. Silkroad started me on bitcoin and bitcoin led me to quit silkroad... Couldn't let go of the coins.

It's really difficult to understand how much coinbase sucks until you have some money on the line and watch a perfect buying opportunity pass you by. They can sy whatever Rey like. I won't be buying much through them until they have fixed the problems. Promises mean nothing. As of today they've probably high risked me out of thousands of dollars worth of
That I can't forgive.

I made an account for campbx the other week. My dwolla transfer should go through tomorrow. So excited to not need coinbase anymore. Happy to say I unintentionally screwed them over in the end. After closing my account the first time with coinbase the stop payment I put in at my bank was still in effect so when I made a new account with the same checking acct and they cancelled my order I emailed them and got white listed and had my order go through... However they did not withdraw the funds, because they couldn't. Free bitcoin for me. I'd feel bad if I hadn't gotten royally fucked by them so many times before missing out on prices because of their bullshit canceling of random orders that were always realizing gains once they were supposed to go through. Seriously fuck coinbase and stop using mtgox.... Spread the bitlove and trade with other exchanges. Campbx in my opinion is the answer to many problems for bitcoin traders right now. Hopefully more people start to use their services... I just hate that mtgox can get screwed with and crash the price by 100 dollars. People... Shop around for a new exchange. Campbx all day.... And night.

They've worked for me plenty... But the waiting can kill you sometimes. They just have a lot of work to do. And the only time I can ever successfully lock into a price is around 1230am est

Sorry forgot to include it.
This is basically what silkroaders use to stay anonymous. Fees are responsible too

They suck jaggonamorph thrushercocks... Personally I switched to campbx.... Once you get ur account fully established they run circles around coinbases dysfunctional bullshit
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:21:15
Good for you bro.... Fuck coinbase in the ear.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:30:31
Ya. Best way I've found so far.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:38:22
By sheer luck I cashed out what I put in the night before all this. I'm just going to hold onto the rest though. And buy up all I can once I'm able to somewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:31:06
Because coinbase sucks ass. That's my reason at least...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:47:23
Why do you suck so hard?

Holding with block chain and using coinbase for cashing out is my fab combo. With bitfloor for buying

Oh no! Not-a-finrand 
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:53:53
So what happens if I delete my bank account from coinbase. Will they still try and go through with orders set for Thursday?
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:41:11
This... Is retarded
