...pretty sure he was being a smart ass.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:29:13
Yeah, I am.  It's ridiculous.  They use skimmers.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:07
Nope.  It's just a skimmer.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:05
Pal, they DO NOT DO THAT ANYMORE.
 
It is straight skimming now.  Please, educate me, though.  You're trying to argue a position that was valid a decade ago.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:05:33
And then what, they beat the shit out of you and steal your card and plug your pin in?  
 
Skimmers, dude.  Skimmers.

I feel sorry for the position you're in, but you've definitely taken a lot of unnecessary risks with your personal safety.

You actually got a BFL unit?

Because millionaires don't keep most of their net worth in something extremely liquid that can't have the transaction reversed.  And if they did have millions of dollars in cash at home, they wouldn't be telling people where they keep it.
 
It's not rocket science.  It's just stupidity.  You might as well just beg people to kidnap/home invade you.

What exactly is the point of this video?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:04:34
Jesus H. Christ, dude.  This hurts to look at.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:02:56
You're babbling about nothing.

You're talking about early adoption and people wanting replace their speculative investment with more of the same asset because they're transacting with their PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT.
It won't be like this forever - but expect a lot of it for the next couple of years.  You should be happy people are actually using cryptocurrency instead of merely holding it - an act that is horrid for the adoption of it.
 
You have an incredibly myopic view of the space.  So I say again - you're babbling about nothing.

Can we stop reposting this?  I've seen this dozens of times lately on all the different bitcoin/btc/crypto subreddits lately.  It's starting to feel like this guy is doing a viral marketing campaign.
