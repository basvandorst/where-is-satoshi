Can you give some info on those not-yet-implemented-ideas to improve privacy? I haven't found anything that convinces me yet, but keeping up is so difficult that I may have missed it.
You've answered me twice, now I know how teenagers feel when they see Justin Beaver :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:53:56
Same with derivatives and nobody cares. Media love to creates demons.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:04:58
Maybe some people will prefer to drive blind. That part of the market will deserve whatever happens to them. I want to believe that we are not stupid and that given the opportunity to choose between an audited exchange and an unaudited one, most will choose security.

I guess Canadian Parliament is not a reliable source.

If you use PGP you need to donate. If you don't use it, you should start using it and also donate. This is one of the few projects that needs to be maintained no matter what.

The price of things IRL is also lower once they are stolen but that doesn't stop thieves, so I don't know why that should stop bitcoin thieves. As long as what they get is enough to compensate them for the risk and time, they will keep doing it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:58:44
Especially when you don't understand them.
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:43:59
They don't need your BTC. They can short BTC without having it. If the price goes up they are screwed (bailout anyone?). If it goes down, which can happen by the mere fact of them shorting, they buy in the market to fulfill their promise and pocket some profit.
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:40:49
The market will. Soon all (most) of us will require exchanges to be audited if they want us to trust and deposit our funds. No need for regulation, without clients bad businesses disappear into oblivion.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:39:43
I agree that people unable to verify should have a place to trade, but that doesn't mean that they should be scammed. Ideally they should be able to ask for as much as those who can verify (solvent exchanges), but I admit that they have less to choose from and maybe they have to settle for btc-e.
@_date: 2014-02-27 11:27:08
Now you can get much more than that if you accept BTC from MtGox
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:23:36
Derivatives. They would promise to buy or sell in the future. If the future arrives and they can't deliver, they'll be bailed out. If they can, they'll keep the profit. They really do know how to do things.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:07:37
Thanks for answering!
I love the first two. Regarding the third, do you mean using Lighthouse to raise money for specific things or managing Lighthouse and collecting fees (I'm not very familiar with Lighthouse, not sure if that is possible)?
As for other ideas, how about:
* Certifications/workshops/trainings for lawyers. With so much regulation it is going to be important to have trustworthy counselors that know what they are speaking about
* Consulting for businesses in the ecosystem. This can get tricky, but there is a ton of money to be made there.

Quite good ineed. Media don't go crazy when foreign currency trading fluctuates like crazy, but they do when it is bitcoin. They also say that bitcoin is only useful for speculation, but they don't say that most foreign currency transactions are also speculative.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:22:12
Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I believe that because of Gox. I agree there were red flags, but nothing that big had failed before. So many people got burned there that someone has to learn! And Vircurex failing now should also help educate.
Anyway, I get your point, maybe bitcoiners tend to ignore risks more than the average person and we all live in Disneyland.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:11:34
A simple bitcoin logo would be better. Or a bitcoin wallet. Even a rack full of servers or a network router.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:56:37
We need to be able to laugh at ourselves
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:34:34
Yes, I was meaning Qt or even the protocol itself. DarkWallet maybe great, but as long as it is used by a small percentage of the users, the privacy risks will still be there for the average bitcoiner.
Edit: btw, thanks for answering, I got into crypto after listening an interview with you in an Econtalk podcast in 2012 and I'm really grateful for everything you have done!!
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:18:31
Does he accept the other bitcoins as payment?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:38:50
Stealing them may sound simple, but doing it right (i.e. not getting caught, not that it is ok) is not that simple. I guess we'll know eventually.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:56:43
I agree their salivating. Not so sure about goverments implicated with MtGox. Shit happens and it had been happening there for a while. Usually the simplest of the explanations is the good one.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:15:10
The problem is that most politicians don't understand bitcoin (or money in general). Some well explained letters by public people like Fred Wilson can help educate. Once educated it is possible they will still chase bitcoin, but at least they'll know what they are doing.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:10:34
Yeah, going to his house it lame. Why would he open if he is not answering emails o phone calls?
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:20:17
I agree about consulting, that is why I said it could get tricky. I love that you don't want to step into what others in the ecosystem can do, but then I see it difficult to find revenue sources. Anywhere the Foundation can make money there can be an entrepreneur wanting to do the same. That is true for the ideas you mentioned too...  Difficult path you have :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:56:32
More exchanges is great news, but using the death of Mt Gox to promote the launch doesn't sound right. I understand it, but it feels a bit too opportunistic.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:34:24
I agree, but it does exist, so it better focus on what it was created for. I would prefer a world in which everyone takes responsibility for his decisions and the government doesn't get that role, but we are not there.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:22:23
She shows some common sense. Fed shoud focus on banks, which pose a much bigger danger for the economy than bitcoin does and have almost destroyed it before.
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:30:23
You said in your blog post at the Foundation's website that it is a business and that it would be managed as such. Can you give some more detail in how the Foundation will sustain itself and generate revenue?
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:12:47
Mt Gox killed Mt Gox. Crashing with the reality of their acts at a speed of 850k BTC per incident, not the knowledge of that reality.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:06:02
Will Bitcoin include anytime soon any new feature to protect user's privacy?
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:29:05
Agree, the simplest of the explanations is usually the good one.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:16:51
Yeah, it is absolutely out of their reach!
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:13:23
At least you have to admit that the fall of Gox has brought some attention to this. I agree that the situation is bad, but the first thing needed to repair something is knowing that it is broken.
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:44:20
Because it should be and international coordinated effort,  governments won't be able to regulate bitcoin. Ever.
@_date: 2014-12-31 12:52:30
You are right. I admit that I always confuse all them and use PGP for everything to simplify.
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:11:11
It has always been. First time I heard about bitcoin a few years ago (I don't remember when, but it was below $10) I didn't buy because of that (I opened an account at Gox but didn't finish all the things required to buy). I regret it everyday :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:38:41
It is true that ever is a very long time, but it is almost impossible for different governments to agree on much simpler things, so I would not expect them to agree on this. They could, however, limit the effectiveness of the system passing local regulation, like taxing exchanges located somewhere. Local regulation would be inconvenient, but we would probably just bypass it.
@_date: 2014-12-31 13:06:17
You are right, I'm sorry for not being accurate. The terminology around openPGP is so confusing and similar that I settled with PGP for everything to simplify. I've done a lot of convincing and helping people to set up their keys, and so many similar names is one of the things I find more difficult to explain (btw, the easiest way to introduce someone to this is Enigmail).

You'd be liable with all your assets. And nobody will sell you big amounts on credit card anyway.

Individual responsibility is the key. When people get lazy because goverment is watching is when you get Lehman Brothers.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:10:52
She is absolutely right. Fed should focus on banks, which are a much bigger risk to the economy than bitcoin. They have almost destroyed it several times and nobody is asking to forbid them.

I would love to know how many malware families are targeting dollars or euros.

Wherever there is profit, the taxman will materialize. He's the hidden partner.
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:11:02
I don't think there is one that fulfills on everything you want.
One you haven't mention is Bter.com. They're quite serious and they are based in China. They offer a lot of pairs, but they don't trade fiat, so you should get your money in from another exchange. I have similar objectives than yours and what I do is get the money into Bitstamp to buy Bitcoin and then transfer the Bitcoin to Bter.com or Crypsty.com to trade on altcoins.
