You can say the same thing about actual fully functional exchanges, except that is not how it works. 
You cannot trade or have a platform that supports trading digital tokens within the USA without an MSB licence. Period. Even bitfinex (a hong kong exchange) has recently banned US users as of late.
The bitcoin protocol itself is decentralized so you can argue that you dont or have no control over it (they can still probably force some miners in their jurisdiction to block or censor transactions, although that would be futile since most miners are in china), however a lightning hub is like having your own mini paypal operating from your basement. Law enforcement can and probably will enforce applicable laws as they see fit (similar to enforcement and sting operations that they do on localbitcoins traders in the US who arent licensed MSB operators or registered with FINCEN).

This only applies to people in New Hampshire providing a service to New Hampshire. Once another state is involved you have to follow their rules, eg. The Bitlicence for New York.

This a legal thing, the US likes to fuck with everyone and they manage to do it all the time. 
You want to risk money laundering charges and hope that your own legal advice is going to stand up in court, sure take the gamble.
This is why bitcoin was created, because of the bullshit system.

Probably because of your endless spamming and creating tonnes of new threads about how BCH is dead. One thread would have been fine, but 5x per day...

BTCChina chucked a tantrum over the ICO ban announcement. 
What a fucking joke.
 I bet they short the market and FUD'd to make a profit, then their final move is to voluntarily close their exchange (literally because of the ICO ban WTF!) so their shorts will profit more.
They gave multiple interviews but were anonymous to scare the market into thinking it was the PBOC, but really it was market manipulation.

A statement by 8 people purporting to represent an entire country...
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:34:47
Its obvious that all he is offering is to buy 750 S2x futures ( in exchange for users putting an actual 250 BTC into escrow. The market value for his shit terms is actually 6.67:1 and he is only offering 3:1...
Arbitrage opportunity for him whilst he owns no bitcoins.

Do you mean mining nodes mine according to bitcoin consensus rules?
Cause other nodes just relay data and dont contribute anything else.
