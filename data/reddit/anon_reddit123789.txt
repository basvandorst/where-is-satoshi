Nope I can think of nothing worse. Tax would be complicated. I’d have to exchange to buy literally anything and yeah that’s direct debits gone out the window. This pay me in bitcoin thing is such a stupid meme. The systems aren’t in place to replace fiat yet and they maybe never will be. 
Get paid like a god damn normal person and buy some Btc or crypto of your choice with your salary every month. This is far more practical, anyone who wants to go full Btc is either hardcore or kinda nuts. The world just isn’t ready

I’m all for change... You have to admit it’s extremely difficult to do at the moment. The systems aren’t in place nothing grampa about it. I’m just not retarded and thinking practically. Also if In order to live and pay your bills you have to convert to fiat every time are you REALLY being progressive and using Btc or are you just an idiot losing money because of fees and charges.
EDIT: Also an employer of any decent size isn’t going to hold multiple currencies to pay their employees in the currency of their choice. Even an international company will just pay you in the countries currency and not based on your whim to be edgy

Coal energy is a form of fossil fuel just FYI. I keep seeing you reply to people who say fossil fuel. Fossil fuel is just the collective term for any non renewable fuel that formed over millions of years which we extract from the ground and burn today. Coal is one of these fuels.
TLDR 
Coal = Fossil fuel

100% real I’m sorry it seems like a fairy tale to you. Lol @ transfers do yourself. I could move money 6 times a minute
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:15:54
Lol the US literally being worse than the 3rd world... RIP
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:58:15
Exactly what I was thinking... If this is how banking is in 3rd world countries/ the US then I really feel sorry for you and I fully understand how game changing bitcoin and crypto currency might be for you guys. Here in the UK my bank account is free, transfers are instant and free, atm withdrawals are free. It’s actually harder and more time consuming/expensive to use bitcoin. It’s best use for me here would be buying goods online or sending to someone in another country who then exhanges it into their currency. However even for that there are solutions like revolut that allow fee free transfers to different currencies at true exchange rate.

About 1 day? Higher sums just require authorisation.
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:02:25
Yeah ikr. I actually had no idea this was a thing. The demand for change and the demand for crypto makes waaaaay more sense when you realise the vocal majority are Americans with an awful system. I truly hope something changes for them, in the meantime I guess I’ll enjoy free instant banking (sorry :p)

See bottom paragraph on why that’s currently unlikely to be possible. When all your expenses are fiat being paid in Btc would be horrid
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:34:00
So... how is scenario different to being paid in fiat and designating X to Btc and buying it yourself? Which is currently the most sensible option. Employers won’t want to pay you in 2 currencies it’s a headache for them
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:23:49
Having my salary paid in bitcoin would be awful. Imagine not knowing if you had enough to pay the bills that month because it crashed between pay days. Never knowing what’s truly in your account because everything is priced in fiat. Having to convert back to fiat for the majority of your purchases and therefore incur fees. Budgeting would be far more difficult.
Almost no one will opt for this and they know it. Hence why it’s a clear PR stunt. It’s so far off being a currency, far too unstable.
I support bitcoin and crypto btw just saying we are far from ready to be paid in it and adopt it over fiat (in first world countries at least)
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:29:16
I refuse to believe you exist without fiat. Unless you cheap and pay people btw for making purchases for you in fiat
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:55:12
Well then my sympathy wears off that point :P if you have a better option and don’t use it then that’s on you tbf

Just saying the graphic is wrong. Mainly on the traditional banking side. Banking works very well and is easy to use. It’s only drawback is centralisation which affects the everyday citizen very little. Hence why Btc adoption and crypto in general is so slow. It’s addressing a problem we don’t really have. It’s a great solution for countries dealing with hyper inflation because it gives them a currency they can use and rely on its value (sort of). But in first world countries with a stable currency, free and instant banking it’s just trying to solve a problem the average joe isn’t having
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:53:52
Use those that don’t charge then? If no one uses those that charge they’ll soon stop
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:20:21
Hate these threads that are simply not true. If your bank legit does this then fucking move bank. I’ve never been with a bank that charged me to do anything with my own money... Just damages crypto tbh because it’s propaganda built on lies.
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:21:03
Lmfao rekt 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:51:36
Every bank? If so that’s genuinely tragic. UK here literally 0 charges for using my bank, debit or cc. I can move money for fun if I want 
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:30:21
Either way you can do it faster and cheaper (free) than you can send bitcoin. Which is why this graphic is retarded and shouldn’t be reposted so often as it’s not even accurate.

Lmfaooooooo ah man I needed that thanks. You can’t assume anything.
