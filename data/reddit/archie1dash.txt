"Every $100 you spend today is $10000 for your future self.'
Wow. It's deep.

True that. I am in it for long term. Most experts say it will be over 4000$ by the end of the year. That is solid profit and the best part is it will keep on increasing in the coming years.

Test the waters by investing a small amount first. You learn a lot when you are motivated to do so.
Google and YouTube are your friends.
Keep googling whatever questions you have.

Wait for the dip. Maybe 1850-1900 and then buy. I will also do the same.

Most alt coins are scam. Think twice before buying.

Yes I bought 75% btc and 25% eth with my savings. It is looking strong too for long term.

You bought at 1550 and bitching about it?
I bought at 2600$ and TBH I am ok

Bitcoin is selling at a premium everywhere because of high demand. 15% hike is normal. In Korea, people are paying premium up to 50%
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:55:40
I am waiting a maximum of 12 more hours. After that, I'll definitely buy.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:00:56
I bought for 2700$ and I regret already. God, why?
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:09:55
It is expensive but only they accept credit cards. No other choice.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:41:21
I am never gonna sell at a loss ... Ever.
I will wait for the btc price to go upwards of 2600$ no matter how long it takes and then only decide upon selling.
That is why I am calm and not freaking out. I know it will climb. Just don't know when
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:56:21
Buy from localbitcoins.com
There are many sellers there who accept credit cards.
