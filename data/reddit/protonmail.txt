Hi caveden, the easiest way is for both you and your mom (in your example) to use ProtonMail accounts. This removes the need for key sharing. Unfortunately we cannot control Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook (and don't trust them either) and so it is not possible (or advisable) to integrate into their systems.
In terms of supporting the service, we will offer paid accounts later with additional storage to cover the cost of the free accounts.

Not quite true, you can get the goodies, but you just need to email is at indiegogo It's inconvenient, but IGG doesn't support bitcoin yet....

Try emailing indiegogo as we're handling campaign related inquiries there.

Hi, this is ProtonMail team here. Not hitting our goal means we can support fewer users so some people on the waitlist will have to wait until we're out of beta to get accounts. Obviously we want to avoid that, but we don't have an unlimited budget to buy servers. With $100k, we can ensure that everybody on the waitlist can get on. Funding is difficult right now because we're turning down a lot of outside money offers to keep ProtonMail independent.

Correct, for ProtonMail to work properly, it does not actually matter where we located our servers.
However, a project cannot survive if it is under constant harassment from the authorities. The way we prevent this is by basing in Switzerland and locating our servers there so US and EU courts have no excuse they can use to pressure and harass us.

ProtonMail team here, first we want to thank all of our supporters on r/bitcoin. As much as we wish we could live in a world without PayPal, there's still a staggering high percentage of the world that uses it. Hopefully this incident will do more to raise awareness of bitcoin and steer people AWAY from PayPal.

ProtonMail separates the storage of encrypted emails (our servers) and the encryption passwords (never transmitted to our servers, known only to the user). This way, if our server is compromised, data is still secure unless the user's encryption password is also known.

Just to clarify, that is our donation address. For actually paying for ProtonMail, we use a different address for each transaction for privacy reasons.

It's true, we are indeed pretty strong HODLers. During the period from when BTC surpassed the original all time high at around $1000 to when it raced to $20'000, and then back to $3'500 and then up until today, we haven't sold a single bitcoin.
People have paid us with bitcoin when it as $200 and also when it was $20'000. BTC forms part of our strategic reserve, for situations when fiat fails (like happened in 2014 when PayPal blocked our account:  [ ). We're probably good at HODL'ing because we don't actually monitor BTC prices.
By the way, part of the Cointelegraph story is inaccurate. Proton never considered an ICO, but we have considered an STO (before it was called a STO). However, at present, we're able to achieve near term development goals with existing resources so there hasn't been a need to raise funds.

ProtonMail team here. With a member of our community, we tried to put together a comprehensive guide for buying bitcoin that is under 1000 words and is aimed at people that don't know anything about Bitcoin. Would be interested in feedback from before we share this.

This is good feedback and we will be incorporating some of it so thanks for that.
Not mentioning anonymity was an intentional omission. All things considered, we don't really believe Bitcoin provides meaningful anonymity for most people. There are many who would disagree with this statement, but there are many good reasons we believe that it would be better for Bitcoin long term if the community did not try to push anonymity anymore as an advantage.
