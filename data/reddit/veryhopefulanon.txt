yes...its not the same thing...your angle is that of a tech nerd who gets boners for technology and cums off it too. You dont have life experience. MY perspective is from research/activity into current events, tech, politics, finance, religion, government, and how they overlap and interact together. These things are connected and not isolated. I'm done speaking to someone so ignorant and single issue.
Leaving you with these nuggets:

You are a fool if you think the governments of the world are going to allow a currency like Bitcoin to thrive. No governments want money to flow into black holes. This is bigger than ALL of us. Not to trample on your bitcoin wet dream.
Bitcoin is still not relevant enough for a takedown. There is plenty of confidential technology that is being developed as we speak that could impact crypto. 
I'm NOT your enemy! I believe in the power of crypto, however I also have life experience and know too well about the ulterior agendas. Also look into how Gaddafi wanted to create an African "Euro" and we know how he ended up.

what you guys dont get is that the government takes down any currencies not affiliated with Rothschild! Thats why we went after Iran and Syria. Bitcoin is no match for the Kabbal and the powers that be!!!! They do not want plebs to become rich because that will cause chaos and destroy capitalism/free labor exploitation.

its not about banning....its about infiltrating the technology itself...you forget that its public knowledge that NSA/US can tap into your technology already (webcam, mobile, echo, ipad....etc). 
You are not safe unless you are using TOR (even then you are flagged already), multiple VPN, etc...
The take down is cooking. Bitcoin right now is NOT relevant enough to pursue on a wide scale-- as much as you bitcoin fanboys want it to be relevant, it really isnt---yet.
