Even with a ton of regulation we won't have security. Just the added costs of it.


Well then I guess it's good thing the employer was there huh? Otherwise they would have died. The employer saved their life. 


Regulation is a broad term. In this case the regulations helped the union workers only but everyone else paid the price because the employer passed it on to everyone else by raising it. 


There should be no regulation preventing it for anyone.


If an employee works 60 hours a week voluntarily then we don't need a regulation preventing that despite what you or I think of the compensation he or she agreed to.


"Overworked" is a matter of opinion. The amount of work they were doing was obviously not worse than not having the job. They were there voluntarily. You can bemoan that they would die if the business were not there but that only paints the business in a positive light.


The timeline suggests that technology brought us out of poverty not the progressive movement. Furthermore the term "Income inequality" implies it is your right or business to know and judge the income of another person whom you know nothing about. That's hubris. It's none of my business what you make and none of yours what I make.


No, access to affordable healthcare is NOT better than it's ever been. And in terms of life expectancy and quality, those occurred due to technological advances not regulation or the progressive movement.


Name one of those please. I agree they are more regulated but we still have the best healthcare here.


The reason our healthcare system is the best is due to a great number of reasons, not the least of which is that we have fewer regulations than many other countries.


We're splitting hairs. It may not be a regulation but it's not the free market either.

I'm not arguing for price stasis, just relative stability. I'm not saying the price of goods in bitcoins will be fixed but relative to the price of goods valued in dollars at the bitcoin exchange rate it would appear to be and the fluctuations would be relatively trivial by comparison. Part of this is specualtion of bitcoun. Right now Bitcoin is seen as more of a a commodity (value priced in dollars) then a currency (like dollars).
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:57:17
In general I agree but at least some percentage of excitement over Bit coin is it's facility for being essentially nontaxable with almost no logistically pragmatic way to discover or punish the violation. At this point you're not exactly the low hanging fruit but, yes, I think you have to remain relatively low profile to keep it up. A major manufacturing and/or brick and mortar affair would be more challenging.

Was it calculated on a Pentium cpu maybe?
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:44:57
Are you measuring the value of bitcons in dollar terms or in purchasing power of bitcoins themselves? The reason I ask is because the CPI is measured in dollars not bitcoins and generally bitcoin prices (For now) are pegged to dollars so that would be a reasonable assumption.
For instance, Let's say you run an online store accepting bitcoins and dollars. Right now you probably price all of your goods on there value in US dollars and when you calculate the price in bitcoin you probably convert the dollar value to bitcoin at current exchange rates. As the dollar price fluctuates so does the bitcoin price as expressed in dollars but IF the value of the dollar drops due to inflation and prices in dollars go up due to inflation as well BUT bitcoin exchange rates change and the value of bitcoins go up relative to dollars then the number of bitcoins it took to buy a widget from your site in absolute terms (EX. 1 widget for 1 BTC) then after an inflationary dollar value drop the price in terms of BTC may still be 1BTC or less. 
So that would be an example of where the dollar price rises but the bitcoin price is flat or drops.

@_date: 2014-02-01 17:26:18
Well that's kind of my point. Governments do not tame violence, the culture and characther of a population does - or doesn't despite government. This characther is reflected in the governments they form but there is a delay. Abolitionism took hold in the population first. So did voting rights and I could go on and on. So instead of a g overnment with a monopoly on force to control the populaton against thier will in many cases we should spend our energy developing an organized system to convince people of the ideas which we feel best serve society. In other words, a religion is far more effective than a government with the threat of force at controlling the behavior I f a population. Most people don't choose not to murder and rape because it is inherently fucked up. If we truly needed laws to prevent these things we'd truly be fucked.

Deflation is not a problem. Let's say you are right and the value of money starts to increase due to demand and people hoard it on speculation. Demand then decreases. If it decreases to the point that people go out of business then things become scarce and when that happens prices.....inflate. Balance occurs. Sure, you will have SOME deflation over time due to a fixed 21 million amount of coins but that would happen in a slow and controlled fashion along with population and business growth.
If slow deflation were ever a real problem then Bank accounts with interest rates to encourage savings would have sent the economy to that same shitter you mention...as would bonds...it would have to be massive runaway deflation...and for the reasons I stated above I don't see that as a possibility.
Enjoy the day.

I'm saying we can live in an Anarcho-Capitalist co-coercion free world. Bitcoin proves this. The feds can't really get their heads around enforcement of regulation on Bitcoin and we have things like MtGox and others who have serious flaws and people get badly burned but we don't form a "federal reserve" of bitcoin. There is no FDIC for crypto-currencies. It's a buyer beware situation. If we look at what happened in the late 1890's with the bank failures due to liquidity panics we see the government reacting with regulation. The result is the massive growth of government bureaucracy which fails over and over to achieve it's mission. Look what's happened to the cost and quality of X since the government decided to create the department of X to regulate X for the good of the public.

It makes me wonder if the governments could buy up bit coin and send them all to false addresses and disappear coin forever.

I read your link "...and is derived from the no arbitrage assumption"
This is the problem. Bitcoin is currently being arbitraged as a commodity more than it's being traded as a currency. Speculators. In order to thrawt the speculators we need one full closed economic loop that will serve as a stable core. No one will want to exchange for other currencies to buy things or get paid. You don't see people arbitraging the dollar (althoug admittedly that's probably a MUCH more complex discussion).
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:57:43


I take exception to this characterization. The people who decided to store their coin on a foreign server may be characterized as victims the first time around. Now everyone knows better but they still took the risk. It should be assumed by anyone that storing your coins on a server you don't control with their address and key means the risk is there. This is buyer beware. 
Furthermore, after GOX everyone declared bitcoin dead. It's not. Even the bear-whale couldn't kill it. People still want bitcoin more than thier native currency. No regulations are in place. No central controls imposed.
Now, having going through this do you really believe that those who do so can claim to be victims? This is "buyer beware".


The industrial revolution of the 19th century revolutionized mankind. It was the manufacturers and innovators who allow more to be produced for cheaper prices and thereby brought up the quality of life of all people. If you compare salaries to today then yes they made less but If you look at the millions of poor immigrants who grew into big families you see that the wages and buying power went up over time *despite* the regulations not because of it. Yes there were injuries and but you don't need regulations to prevent People from getting hurt or having a long work day. If a company has unsafe working conditions the word gets around and people don't take those jobs unless the risk of injury is better than not having the job. The same for long work hours.
My boss works 60 hours a week. He does this by choice. We don't need the government to tell him he's being abused if he's there by choice. Same for everyone else.
Unless it's actual slavery every employee/employer relationship is a voluntary agreement on both sides. If you are a good employee other businesses will compete for your talent by offering lower hours and better pay and more. 
History is mostly a tale of tragedies but nobody tells the tales of most people being happy. If one guy gets screwed but the rest are far better off as a whole the story is about the one guy. It focuses on only tragedy and paints a false picture based on noteworthy outliers.


Okay, here's one. College education. Until the government started providing guaranteed student loans college was much more affordable. Most people worked their way through college. Now you can hardly afford to do that because the colleges know their income is guaranteed.
Here is another. Healthcare. Before we began to heavily regulate doctors and the drug industry there were some tragic consequences but things were affordable. Now with the regulations on doctors, malpractice suits, the FDA and healthcare (not even to mention the ACA) Healthcare is now unaffordable to most people unless they have a job with a group insurance plan. Is that a good tradeoff to avoid an occasion tragedy (which they don't anyway). 
I could literally go on and on and on but It's Halloween.
Best of luck.

Currently we calculate the buying power of goods and services as based on **the exchange rate of bitcoins to dollars**, and not bitcoins themselves. So yes I would bet on it if we could agree on what constituted the adoption point.
I'm sorry if you lost buying power based on the exchange rate of dollars to BTC. As an investor that sucks but if we didn't price things first in dollars, and then calculate thier value based on the **exchange rate in dollars** or any other currency then, no, we would not have these swings. The supply of bitcoin is finite. It is unique in this. 
In future in a closed-loop bitcoin only system with no exchanges, price would ONLY fluxuate with the supply of goods snd services and those who wish to use them, which is a much smaller swing than inflationary currency exchange values.

The consumers should be doing that with thier dollar vote. They can't because of government granted monopolies to the ISP in the form of license and regulations which prevent competitive startups from challenging their business.

You mean in dollars which the farmer doesn't care about?


More dollars which I don't use because I buy food and pay rent in bitcoin?


Because suddenly bitcoinville residents are dabbling in small-scale currency arbitrage where they exchange their native bitcoin currency for some other currency that they have to then exchange back into bitcoin to pay rent and buy groceries?


Okay but where would they live? Rent is paid in the same currency wages are paid. Sure they could send as much extra bitcoin back home like the immigrants from mexico to america do with dollars but that doesn't exactly hurt bitcoinville.


You keep talking about the "price" of bitcoin....imagine if I kept talking about the "price" of dollars. It would sound weird. You keep thinking of Bitcoin in terms of the exchange rate in dollars. What if the tables flipped and Federal reserve notes were talked about in terms of the established currency Bitcoin. Everyone would talk about how the Dollar keeps sinking.


Because the exchange rate for bitcoin to some foreign currency that nobody in bitcoinvile uses suddenly jumped? It would be no more disruptive than in the current system when bitcoin shot up to 1000. Nobody using dollars really gave a damn. Sure, some people started speculating and trading dollars for bitcoins as an investment but it had no real effect on the dollar economy.

Follow me on this:
- Value is tied to scarcity.
- You exchange FRN's for Bitcoin at $270 apiece to buy my commodity at a fixed rate of ฿1BTC per unit.
- As a result BTC becomes slightly scarcer and FRN's become less scarce.
- My exchange rate is fixed so in terms of my commodity to bitcoin there is no fluctuation in exchange rates. Still 1:1.
- The exchange rate of FRN's to Bitcoin fluctuates and, should my commodity become demanded in significant volume you'll have people dumping dollars to buy bitcoins to buy my commodity (think petrodollar and how oil was traded only in dollars making the FRN the reserve currency that everyone had to acquire to buy oil.)
- Bitcoin will then go up in dollar value but my exchange rate is STILL 1:1 BTC. (Imagine if you had to pay 2BTC for an I-phone 7 and they ONLY took exactly 2 BTC forever regardless of the exchange rate, it would appear to get more expensive but ONLY in BTC **priced IN DOLLARS**)
Now, in the above example I assume that I have the discipline to keep my rates the same regardless of the exchange rates of the majority-use currency. Maybe in that I'm slightly "cray." I do see, however, situations where countries could have a semi-closed economy where there are very few relative exchanges for BTC to FRN. In other words a nation which uses BTC as it's official currency and in which whole communities use the currency exclusively. You get paid in BTC, pay rent in BTC, buy grocs in BTC...etc...total life. Closed circle. Then the exchange rate would not matter, you are not exchanging.

I do believe if we can get one community where people get paid and buy all of their necessities in Bitcoin that that will serve as a seed of stability and it will grow from there as exchange rates favor the stability. I don't see Bitcoin as an investment. I see it as an alternative currency with a much slower rate of inflation.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:39:14

"The gold standard" means paper currency tied to gold. People haven't actually carried around bits of gold as currency for centuries. The gold standard is not about gold, it's about the currency tied to it. The gold just sat in a vault. The gold standard simply established a fixed exchange rate between gold and the paper.




Okay, so in a post-apocalyptic society sure. But you've had to create a scenario where the world is destroyed in order to make your case. That scenario is not the one in which we live. Sure, after the nukes I'd probably want gold to trade to the local warlord for food and so he could make a splendid crown and bitcoin wouldn't mean much.
That to me does not support your original claim that it has more value as a resource. If you offered me gold or bitcoin right now I'd take the coin. Online vendors don't take gold coin as payment.


You say that but right now is right now and right now Bitcoin is the most widely know and adopted. It has brand recognition.


So gold is a more inherently valuable because you can use it to fill cavities and not so with Bitcoin. Look I get that yes, gold is physical matter and bitcoin is information. I feel like the ledger is more inherently useful.


You misunderstand me.
I wasn't listing the elements as replacements for your list but by their inherent value. I'm saying the list I could make for uses would be far longer. If the world had to chose to give up either silicon or gold then gold loses. Silicon has far more useful inherent value as an element than gold. There just happens to be more of it. Most of gold's value is in it's scarcity. That's also what gives bitcoins their value as well. Silicon is more inherently useful than gold but not rare.


Seems legit. I think we got into fractional people a few decimal places back. So you're saying that about a thousandth of one guy's fingernail agrees with me.


So why aren't we seeing this with Bitcoin?

That idea relies on 2 things:
1. Known points of reference between a specific coin address and an exact individual. Sometimes, like at certain exchanges, this is available but sometime it is not.
2. Control of Exchanges. You can outlaw them and most counties have but that only makes the process less convenient, not impossible.
Without those 2 things it simply doesn't matter how much you attempt to stifle the use of anonymous payments through crypto-currencies in your nation.

Can you give an example?


I disagree. Other coins are trying and if it were easy someone would have done it already. Bitcoin has value in it's adoptence level.


Gold's value is in it's scarcity. What you are suggesting is like me saying "Gold could be replaced by Platinum or Palladium." Sure, but it all has to be mined either way and that represents time and effort so it is a measure of stored value.


Actually, what is being stated? It seems this conversation began by you refuting bitcoin having as much inherent value as gold.

    Construction
    Aerospace
    Microbiology
    Physics research
    Semiconductors
    jewelry

If you double-spend the vendor gets paid by the holding institution who credited you but then they can come after you if your bitcoin didn't end up in their vault?

You will almost certainly default, or commit suicide because there's no way you'll ever be able to pay me back.
You are assuming that payments will be made in fixed amounts of non-bitcoin currency. I see deflation as lowering prices not an exchange rate differential between currencies. Eventually when the exchange rate for bitcoin makes other currencies obsolete for practical purposes nobody will be working for $15/hr they'll be working for .000000173 BTC/hr. So what you are describing is currency arbitrage. 
Now, let's say that we look at **only** bitcoins and goods. If a pizza goes for 25 bitcoins today and I borrow that from you and then next year a pizza goes for .1 bitcoins then you are going to be a happy camper.....but that doesn't mean my factory job suddenly cut my pay to 1/2500 of what it was last year, it means that suddenly my pay goes much further.

Banks must hold a certain percentage of deposits. Say you deposit $1,000 in the bank. The reserve rate is set by the fed. If it is 10% then the bank can loan $900 of that and make a higher interest rate from it than they pay you for the deposit. So the bank ***at the same time*** represents that it has your $1000 while also having 90% of it loaned out for profit.

No because you won't actually own the house or if you do then you still owe the $80k. The bank both uses your money and represents that it is all still available to you at the same time. That's the critical difference. Your financial psychology is different than say, if you loan your buddy money and he agrees to pay you back. In that instance you are actually out the money. This is an important distinction because it affects your behavior. It effectively makes more money available to be spent which means the supply of money has effectively increased. This is inflationary.

That will be the case regardless of the taxation structure. I think instead of trying to force equality we try and educate and be socially aware of the causes of poverty. No need for it with all the tech and agricultural advances. Governments tax the poor because the rich and middle class have....and will always have...the luxury of redistributing the burden downward so in the end taxes on the rich end up as taxes on the poor. Raise taxes on Con-Agra and the price of Ramen noodles rises. Raise minimun wage and prices go up again due to increased labor costs being passed on. In fact the rich will be hurt by price increases much less than the poor for the very reasons you stated. Progressive taxes sound good in thoery but get passed down to those they were meant to help.

I didn't comprehend what you wrote. I straight-up said that. Because you keep talking about bitcoin as if it has two different simultaneous exchange rates. Think about it. Don't get defensive.
I don't know you and you don't know me. Stick to the merits of the argument.


You haven't made a point.


No it isn't. Please literally re-read what you wrote and what I wrote. Maybe you were thinking faster than you were typing and missed a few words or something.


Okay now here's something I can work with....A price change in terms of **WHAT?!?!??!**
You do realize that some people do business in currency other than dollars. Some countries use Yen. Some countries use Dinars. Some countries use Shekels. All of those fluctuate in terms of exchange rates.


Maybe you just cannot conceive of a world where things are priced in something other than dollars. Maybe that's the problem like if I tell you I'm two meters tall you have to convert that to feet and inches to know how tall I am or If I tell you the temperature is 33°C you have to convert to Fahrenheit to know if you need a coat.
Believe it or not there are things bought and sold in the world which are not first converted to dollars or valued in terms of dollars.
If you disagree please refer to my comments by copying them and putting a "&gt;" symbol in front of them. Then discuss so I can see what you specifically disagree with.

So I recently transferred some coin from Coinbase to Core on my home PC. Somewhere in my Core software is a private key for the address? How does my .DAT file play into all this?

But at the rate processing power for price is rising that'll be at 65 in just a year or two. Before you know it someone may be able to crack it before the heat death of the universe.

I think tax breaks on everything help...the people...of the united states.

Sure but the economic activity of a man who loans a friend $100,000 will be far more niggardly than the activity of a man who puts $100,000 in a bank who loans it to his friend. This means more money is available.

Well....Ok I think I get it. Because what would prevent your address from getting cloned. The network knows what coins go to what address.

+1 for you and a hearty chuckle for me.

Are those those fancy new meatspace bitcoins I keep hearing anput?

Isn't it good news and confirmation that governments are terrified of the loss of control it represents?

Assange and Snowden already revealed that it's not just the software but the hardware that's compromised as well.

Thanks. I'm probably a little ignorant. I'll check that out.

Bitcoin is the Abraham Lincoln of the tax slave.

Nice! Also you could probably post this in MFA. Reflection looking stylish.

People are mining bitcoin as fast as they possibly can. This is inflationary. Bitcoin is gaining in popularity. This is deflationary.

Why would it matter? let's say I backup the wallet.dat file and my original copy on my hard drive gets corrupted or the drive fails. I still have that backed up file.....but if I didn't could I recalculate it?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:29:34
But if the network already has on file that I am the owner of that coin why would it suddenly feel differently whether I had a backup wallet.dat file or I recalculate it from scratch?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:41:02
Right.....I get that....But what I'm asking is....What if I didn't?

Because China is an oppressive regime which controls with great zealousness their populace and is VERY sensitive about threats to that control. This is a de-facto admission by one of the worlds largest governments that governments are scared of being undermined. This is good news because it legitimized the belief that bitcoin is capable of succeeding. Now the people of the world will be in control of their prosperity and not have it choked off in the name of pie-in-the-sky central planning boondoggles.

Pardon my ignorance but how do they verify the transaction before you get out of the store?
