Man I suck at this. Just bought a bunch right before the dip. I thought China getting involved in crypto was a good sign for Bitcoin but fuck me I guess.

Well, I guess own it enough that I can turn it into cash down the road lol.

Yeah I learned about the marked up prices. You can kinda get around that buy doing limit orders, but it's kind of a pain. I haven't tried to cash out yet. Hopefully that won't be a problem but we will see.

I'm pretty new to Bitcoin and how it bumps around in the market? Are these fluctuations typical during one of these Bitcoin "booms"? It was up past 11k this morning and now it's back down to 10.4k.

What are your thoughts on using Robinhood instead? My main interest is an investment, rather than owning actual Bitcoin (while I have some in a wallet already). Robinhood doesn't have any transaction fees.

Well that's the plan for now...if I actually make some cash I'll be sure to allocate some money each week to buy Bitcoin. Especially if it tanks super low again like it did in 2018.

Welp. Robinhood crypto trading just took a shit and I was not able to process my sell. I tried to cancel the sell and it got stuck, and now I can't even sell what I got left because the stuck order is tying up my account.  
So, all I got left is to HODL. But yeah, I may not be using Robinhood anymore. Watching that plunge and being completely unable to process an order was horrifying.

I guess I'm somewhat ashamed to say that I'm here for the reasons you described. Still new to this, and I've been enjoying the ride and learning so much about the market and bitcoin. I guess the good news is that, even with the crash yesterday, I still made around $100 to $200. Pulled out all but a little bit for now, as it seems heads or tails whether it will go up or down at this point. A lot of the "expert" analysis I've read indicates that a drop below 11.3k could be a sign of it bottoming out around 7k. Either way, its been pretty fun overall. Even though Robinhood taking a shit yesterday during the crash (and loosing all that profit with no recourse) might have taken a few years off me. Lesson learned!
And I get it, HODL seems to be the best long term option, and I probably would have had more nerve to do that had I not thrown in a majority of my savings. I think when and if it takes another downturn, I'll throw in maybe half and commit to HODL. I see now that had I had the nerve to HODL from the get go, I would be a lot better position overall!

Yes I am just now learning about crypto and how all this works this week. As are a lot of people, and that's for everyone's benefit, as I understand it. Any tips rather than condescending jabs would be much appreciated?

Yeah this sounds like a great strategy. From all the research I have done I believe in Bitcoin at this point. Not only in its potential long term value, but what it represents and its significance to the economy in the future. Right now I feel that any amount of bitcoin one can own is a great long term investment. The mistake I made was allowing the dollar signs to roll through my head after looking at 20-30% gains happen so quickly and throwing too much in. The FOMO is real lol, and it seemed silly not to ride the bull. Of all the things I accounted for, I was NOT expecting a technical error to result in me loosing that much in returns. I'm currently looking into whether Robinhood can be held accountable at all. I feel like a broker should be responsible if a technical error, outside of each user's control, effects their ability to make profitable trades. I realize there are next to no protections or guarantees when it comes to crypto, and understandably so, but the stability of the platform in general should not be a factor you have to worry about.

If I've learned anything today, It's to not do this lol. Had a few lucky high sells and low buys yesterday and this morning. Got cocky and sold out this afternoon right before it rocketed up past 12k. Had to rebuy for 200 more than I sold.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:58:15
Right. Which is why next time I'm going to buy low (with an amount I can afford to loose) and HODL. You know, what I told myself to do in the first place lol. It's just hard to stop the dollar signs from spinning in your head when you're looking at 20-30% gains over the course of like, a day lol.

For anyone else having issues. Here is their status page.

I bought a bunch of Bitcoin instantly using Robinhood without a convenience fee. They even fronted me the money from my bank transfer so I can buy it immediately. I can't use or transfer the coin unfortunately, but at least I own some I can ride the bull with for a while.

I actually started watching this video last week! About halfway through it. Good reminder to finish watching it.
