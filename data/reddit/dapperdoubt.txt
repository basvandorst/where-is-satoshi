I just understood what you meant by this :) I still don't know what I am doing, but this is really interesting and I love to learn more about it. Thank you for the link!

u/iancoleman can you please explain?

Can you please take a look at [my question here]( regarding your tool. Thank you!
Edit: I already got my answer. Thank you for this very helpful tool!

Thank you very much! also [the flowchart on your Twitter]( was very interesting!
I am trying to understand this better. u/d3vrandom and u/ghost43_ ([1]( [2]( have confirmed that Electrum uses BIP84. after a little search I understood that that's the derivation path which most other software wallets use, including Core, Coinomi,  Samourai Wallet, and Wasabi Wallet. So what is the use of BIP141 tab on Ian Coleman's [BIP39 tool](

Thank you very much! So if most wallets, including Electrum, use bip84 for p2wpkh addresses, can you please tell me what is the BIP141 tab on Ian Coleman's [BIP39 tool](

Why BIP84 is needed? its [proposal]( says "to have a common derivation scheme", but bc1 addresses are already being used. How does a wallet like Electrum creates these addresses now and why can't their derivation scheme be adopted by everyone else?
