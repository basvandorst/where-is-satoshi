Fair enough, but many times a lot of these big players use a short position as a hedge against an asset which they currently own. This can result in a lot of this big money owning BTC and hedging it though their short position. It wouldn't be all to surprising if a good portion of these guys sell their BTC before their contracts  expire, driving the price down to cash in nicely. After this, they can pick back up some more BTC at a discounted price. Of course it's illegal, but in a young, unregulated, relatively small market, collusion and manipulation wouldn't be too big of a shock.

Okay, sure...what kind of a call is that? 2K? You sound like one of those salty people that never got in.

Overconfident + idiotic = dangerous combo

Lol dude...

Right, now there's nothing wrong with making a bearish comment, but it's a bit ludicrous to comment that it's headed to 2k. 
Possibly the only thing worse than mindless FUDers are individuals who make arrogant assumptions. You seem a bit full of yourself.

I'd have to agree here. I personally think Wall Street is driving down the price to cash in on their short position. Once the contracts expire, they'll buy up with everything they have, and take the price up.  The strange thing is, the new around bitcoin has been pretty positive. Goldman backing it, Jamie Dimon publicly saying he regrets calling it a fraud, Russia approving crypto trading, and South Korea fighting back and announcing a ban won't be happening. Also, the lightning network is looking promising...If all the news is positive, but the price is being held down, the conclusion can seem almost obvious.

Too bad it's a bull trap

Poor guy bro. His net worth is like 300k now

Nah man...it’s fairly obvious to me that the crypto markets are being largely manipulated...Wall streets hedge funds begin shorting futures and negative news comes out. Now they’ve switched to a long position and positive news comes out. Coincidence? ��
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:00:24
That's completely irrelevant and a terrible point lmao

160k btc still in their hands...
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:00:55
Yeah, hedge funds have a lot of swing

It's fucking hilarious how some really think bitcoin will put an end to the banks...please think a bit more rationally

Source? Genuinely wish this is true

You should go for it IMO. At the end of the day you’ll be obtaining a solid degree with a good job market. Finance majors have the potential to make a lot of money, although they have to work for it. 
Although I love crypto, I don’t believe it will be replacing traditional finance, but rather integrated into the current system. The only risk you run here is a lack of jobs due to a crash, recession, economic weakness, and so on. But then again that’s pretty much any field or position. If you get a high GPA, you can get some crazy paying jobs, along with crazy work hours ;)

Lol this is fucking bad...160k bitcoin will go to Mark Karples...one person! RIP

Making a statement that BTC is is going to reach a new ATH is not a fucking PSA. It's stupid statements like this that people believe and get burned. Stop saying things like this. Nobody knows what's going to happen. It could go up or it could go down.

That's it? LMAO
