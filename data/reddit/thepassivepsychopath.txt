Yes. Also, no.

So, is it a good or bad thing that price is staying constant just below $11k? 
Is that strength or weakness or is it not that simple? (Legit asking)

What in the literal fuck are you rambling about?
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:29:04
Hahaha, so you got burned after you bought high and sold low and now you're bitter.

I don't see the point in gambling, either. People just use that line because crypto is wildly volatile and hard to predict so it seems like random chance that anyone makes money in it. There's a difference between blindly gambling while proclaiming "lAmBOs t0 thE m0On!" and buying at times and prices that are more likely to profit.

If I may stick a spear into your high horse, people can do whatever they want with their money. Trying to make money off the crypto rollercoaster can work or fail but it's not greedy in the least.
