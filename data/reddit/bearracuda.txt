Anyone else think this sounds like they're setting up to go all in a crypto, issue an A rating, then dump that shit once the public predictably goes crazy and everyone buys in?
Something in this report stinks, and it smells a lot like the crooked sub-prime mortgage backed securities ratings from early 2008...

Sure - I agree with your first point, especially during a bull market, but why would dollar cost averaging not excel during a recession? The dollar cost averagers were buying their shares over time, so they got noticeable portions of their investment at a lower cost than the guys who bought in before the crash and hodl'd.
It's not rocket science, but if you insist on a source, [here you go.](

Let's take two investors, they both have 6k dollars to invest over two years.  Doesn't matter if they're buying stock or bitcoin, because dollar cost averaging works the same for both. Guy 1 just dumps his money in upfront. Guy 2 uses dollar cost averaging.
* Day 1 - $10 - Guy 1 puts in 6k, Guy 2 puts in 1k.
* Start of Month 4 - $8 - Guy 1 hodls, Guy 2 puts in 1k.
* Start of month 7 - $6 - Guy 1 hodls, Guy 2 puts in 1k.
* Start of month 10 - $9 - Guy 1 hodls, Guy 2 puts in 1k.
* Start of month 13 - $11 - Guy 1 hodls, Guy 2 puts in 1k.
* Start of month 16 - $13 - Guy 1 hodls, Guy 2 puts in 1k.
* End of month 18 - $14
Guy 1's investment ends at a value of $8,400, and he has a 40% return. Guy 2's investment ends at a value of $9,388, and he has a 56% return. Why? Because he put in portions of his money during the lows as well as the highs.
Now, this doesn't always turn into more money for the dollar cost averagers. If the value had gone straight up rather than dipping first, Guy 1 would have taken Guy 2 to town, but investments very rarely go straight up and the real power in Dollar Cost Averaging is in mitigating your losses.
Take the start of Month 10 for example - Guy 1's 6k is now worth 5400 and he's sitting on a 600 dollar loss hoping for it to go back up. Guy 2 on the other hand has only put in 3k, but his 3k is now worth $3,525 because he bought when it was valued at 8 and 6 dollars.
Make sense?

Your practice - buying in at regularly times intervals regardless of value - is a common practice called dollar cost averaging, and it's brilliant. 
I read recently that people who used dollar cost averaging for their stocks throughout the recession earned their losses back about two years faster than those who didn't.
