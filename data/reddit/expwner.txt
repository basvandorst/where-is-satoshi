Again, anecdote is not data. The whole idea of the "patriarchy" is that it's a system that oppresses women as a whole, not just one person's experiences. I called you out on your bullshit (which you did not back with data), and provided examples as well as data on examples of sexism perpetuated by feminism. Remember my first post? You're proving my point: feminists don't have room to call something crazy.

So the Constitution in itself is the problem.

Look at the typical US household. Many aren't driven to invest simply for the purposes of maintaining purchasing power. However, a lot take on debt (I'd say more than do invest). The rationale for the latter is that debt payments will decrease (when you account for inflation) over time.

Nope, read again. The Duluth model is also used in domestic violence disputes. Ever heard of a guy calling the police after being abused by his wife, only to be arrested himself? That's the Duluth model in action.
The Tender years doctrine was put in place by a feminist too. Family courts still use this, as evidenced by bias in child custody cases.

The model says that in general females and children are the victims (and not perpetrators) of abuse. In practice, this has resulted in many men being arrested for domestic abuse that they did not commit. In many cases, men have been arrested after reporting their abusers. This model was put in place by people who claimed that men were by and large the abusers, only to skew the statistics in their favor.
You won't read them, but there's more reading on DV [here]( and [here](


No, it fucking doesn't. Read just a little lower under the history section and you'd see that it was started by Caroline Norton, a feminist. The result was the presumption of maternal custody that is still around today. Ask almost anyone who they think will win a custody battle in a divorce. Sexism straight from feminism.


Except it ISN'T legal to pay a woman less for the same exact job, and it doesn't fucking happen! [Payscale]( had an article that addressed this myth. [Here]( is another version of it. The patriarchy isn't underpaying women. Women choose jobs that earn less.

Sure! Let's say a person has $1,000. This person decides to buy a tv that he/she doesn't really need. That money could have been invested, or maybe saved for a future purchase on something that *is* needed (like say car repair and maintenance). This is called opportunity cost.

The state hasn't established legitimate ownership over this land, so it has no place in dictating terms of a so-called contract as private individuals do on their own property. Also no private party can claim that you are part of a contract simply for being on their property.
In any case, the "you can just leave" argument fails because it is a red herring. It ignores the moral problem at hand.

The fact that people invented it doesn't change the fact that I don't have to ask for fucking permission in order to have it. Property rights are as natural as bodily autonomy in that regard. The fact that people came up with the idea of self-ownership and the concept of not being raped doesn't mean that a bunch of people getting together to instate a system of rape makes it "not rape." Same with the concept of not being robbed doesn't mean that a bunch of people getting together to instate a system of theft doesn't make it "not theft."

I'm not sure why you got a downvote, because this is a great question. In my opinion, it is the **right** question to ask. The answer to that is that one should join an organization that performs the same services but doesn't violate the rights of others. This is *only* achievable through private enterprise. I would suggest checking out [this episode]( of the Tom Woods show in which a private police officer describes the work he's been doing in Detroit, a place that desperately needs help.

Neither does the mafia, but saying "that's not how it works" isn't a moral justification for extortion, now is it? Nor does it refute the fact that it is theft/extortion.


No, they didn't. You have no method by which to falsify this statement. There is no metric by which you can make this claim.

Okay, but that's just semantics. The underlying aspect of competition is still there, and in the case of cold medicine generics are cheap and highly competitive. There may be only a few different compounds that can do the trick, but it's enough such that you're not stuck with any one company jacking up the price. The cases where you do see jacking up the price (Epipen anyone?) are clearly FDA or patent issues and not the market.

No, it isn't. Life expectancy in the US adjusted for things like homicide and car deaths (not related to healthcare) is better than the unadjusted figures present.


I'm just talking about the system as a whole. If I recall correctly, stuff like cancer survival rates are much better and we're also better equipped. Part of the expense absolutely is a factor of you get what you pay for. Not all of it and probably not even most of it, but part of it.

Nope, for the poor people just as much as the rich people. Poor people aren't well served by state police agents today. They see crime at higher rates and usually get hassled rather than helped by police. Look at how the Detroit Threat Management is helping where the public police are not. Also fire service worked well for even those who couldn't pay under a private fire insurance model.

That's not the point. If I robbed you and left a ham sandwich that you ate for lunch, you couldn't really say that you didn't benefit from the ham sandwich. The point is that it isn't worth the cost, and all things in life have some form of opportunity costs.


No, this doesn't follow and for two good reasons. The first is that in practice having state police and the laws that go with them (war on drugs being the biggest) makes the world less safe and not more safe. The second is that we're not comparing having state police agents vs nothing at all but rather having agents of the state handling policing vs having some form of a private security market. The private security firm would perform all of the monitoring/prevention that state agents could ever do, except without the extra BS that makes the place less safe.


Again, we're not just talking about having these things or not. We're talking about having a private model and the opportunity costs of public vs private.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:06:31

Wrong. That's what happens today because the supply of doctors and hospitals is limited which prevents competition.


No, it didn't. This is just a circular logic rationalization.


Then you understand that making government the insurer doesn't change this reality.


Not interested. People should pay for things themselves. Forcing others to pay is wrong.


Bullshit. We have seen and still see the market making healthcare affordable where it is allowed. Surgery Center of Oklahoma is more transparent and doesn't get involved with Medicare/Medicaid. Look at how they dropped prices. Healthcare in the US before the 60s was relatively cheap. No government programs for healthcare. This was a perfectly good solution for everyone except doctors and insurers that weren't making tons of money at the time.

You can do so yourself and have indicated a willingness to do so. It's guys like George that we're talking about. Maybe he doesn't think the government is efficient with his dollars.

That's all voluntaryism is: the idea that it is wrong to initiate force against others.

Likewise. When pressed for an argument as to how sums of money demanded from others is in any way civilized, you have to go through intense mental gymnastics to rationalize it to yourself, but usually just resort to insults instead because you don't want to engage in an argument.

Wrong. Healthcare like any other good or service should be a market like anything else. You don't have a right to goods or services just because you exist.

He calls bitcoin a bubble and thinks that the dollar is on the verge of implosion. I'm inclined to believe that he's right on bitcoin volatility in the short-run but horribly wrong in the long-run, and I think he's horribly wrong on the dollar in the short-run but probably close to right in the long-run. I think his timing is all wrong and he's making himself look like a fool because of it.

I've heard this before, but it still ignores that there are many things that simply cannot and will not ever be automated.

Correcting you right now. Private markets produce competition which drives down the cost of goods and services. We see improved results with competition in school systems in particular (where people are free to choose a different school), and the Surgery Center of Oklahoma drove prices down significantly when they posted prices and cut out government funding from the equation.


Government outsourcing to private contractors isn't comparable to private companies in a market. The US currently has private contractors working on roads, for example. That does not make it fundamentally private. There is no competition because people still have to pay the government (or contractor) for the thing. The second paper you linked mentions competition but I don't see any distinction between private contracting and a truly private market.

I didn't get malware, but I can confirm that it is a waste of time. It seems like it is worth it at first, but it takes way too long to make a few cents. If you do the math, you'll find that you'll make a lot more through rewards sites and answering surveys for money. Try something like [Swagbucks]( or Mturk instead.

Yes, we do. Those of us with a bit deeper understanding of the history and economics of healthcare know that it goes back further than the ACA and also includes Medicare, Medicaid, AMA licensing, certificates of need, etc. These are all examples of government fucking up the healthcare industry. You'll note that healthcare got more expensive and much quicker after the 60s.

No. Taxation is theft, period. You can put your own money to good use.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:14:21


On the contrary, it *is* an accurate comparison. The reason why you don't see competition in healthcare in the US is largely due to regulatory constraints on the supply of doctors and hospitals.


I just explained how it absolutely is.


Yes, you absolutely could in the case of hospitals being free to start up wherever they wanted and a network that is pre-selected.


You'd have more choices if not for IP laws. Again, regulation.


Doubt it. If you check out [this video]( at around the 7 minute mark he starts talking about IP and innovation and points out that most of the best medical innovations and medicines had no need for IP in order to be created.


No, I'm showing you how it would solve it if not for government regulations at every turn.

In the US, the police do a double disservice to the poor by not adequately addressing their real issues and also hassling them for things like victimless crimes. The fire departments are usually fine (mostly volunteer actually), but there have been multiple cases in which municipal fire departments were ordered to watch a place burn because the rural inhabitant didn't opt in to pay their fee ahead of time. A private company might charge a hefty fee for point of service as opposed to insurance, but it sure as shit isn't going to watch a house burn down just because someone didn't pay insurance ahead of time.

The baby boomer generation is anything but victims of the socio-political environment. They were born to a generation that was gaining prosperity through relatively free markets, they themselves were beneficiaries of the post-WWII boom, and then they managed to also get a free ride on future generations. Social Security and Medicare are paying these people, and the costs are being pushed onto younger generations.
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:21:01
Sure, and they can pay for all of those things to private companies so that it actually reflects their use and the value to the recipient rather than some arbitrary amount imposed upon them by government.

Yeah, so much that they'd all rather stay at home and sit on their asses! People literally wouldn't know what to do if not for go(d)vernment taking charge of muh roads! /s


False. Impact on the road is related to vehicle weight more than fuel consumption.


That's because you're once again attacking a straw man.


It's a convoluted logistical nightmare
This is nothing more than "hurr durr wouldn't work" without anything of substance to support it. Private companies do the logistics on thousands of other goods and services. You sound like the kind of dumbass who, if raised in the USSR, would deny the viability of private grain production.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:23:16


Yes, it is, because this:


is not even remotely close to being "determined by the willful contributions of your neighbors" in any meaningful sense. If we're discussing market purchases then it's not something like "let's all pitch in!" It's "pay the company for use of the thing."


Ah yes, Oklahoma, the place where all of the roads are privately owned and managed rather than a state granted monopoly! /s
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:57:07


Because they own the things.


Probably terms of contract along with the enforcement of said contract.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:48:40


Of course, but there's a difference between paying dues and getting service as opposed to hoping that your neighbor also wants to pay into a collective.


You keep falling into this strawman/false dichotomy. For one, it's not like they're "paying for the privilege" but paying for the same thing that they already pay to maintain. Second, it's not like people would suddenly not want to pay towards road maintenance just because it's not done by the state.


This is nothing more than argument by assertion. Forcing people to fund something that they don't use is evil. Forcing people to give up their land so that someone else can travel more easily is evil. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:06:01


Presumably because other people have something that they're willing to give in order to preserve it. If not then you have no case for government as some altruistic organization when it takes funds for such efforts. You say "good of humanity" as if it isn't some vague and impossible to define nonsense. Why is government ownership an incentive to preserve things for the good of humanity? Answer: it isn't. It's an idealized fiction that you tell yourself to feel better about collectivism.

That's a complete straw man. See Walter Block on the Privatization of Roads and Highways.

Nope. Either people overwhelmingly want to pay to maintain such things - in which case their money would go towards it just as easily as a vote - or they don't, in which case the government isn't doing anyone any favors. You cannot have it both ways.


States don't exist to protect your rights. Cops spend a majority of their time on stuff like traffic tickets and drug busts. How many people do you think want to pay to bust others for parking/speeding/drugs? How do you propose that this would be enforceable in a private property society?

I see what you're saying about bitcoin not being practical for tipping, but you're wrong about tipping being necessary. Federal law in the US *requires* employers to make up the difference if tips + wages do not provide minimum wage.

Lol, it's fine. I actually haven't messed with bitcoin tipping on here myself.
I think it will eventually bottom out and bounce back. However, there's no telling where that point might be. The general sentiment of this thread is to hold/buy in order to maintain confidence in the market. In the end, you have to make your own decisions, though. No one is an expert.

I'm no tax expert, but I just finished a degree in accounting so I have some background. One should theoretically be able to claim expenses against that income, provided that you can directly attribute costs to the production of mining. It might be tough to distinguish use of electricity (personal vs business), but hardware purchased for bitcoin mining should be easy to deduct.
