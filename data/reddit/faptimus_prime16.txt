So just because your ledger "bricked" you downvote me for trying to help someone else?

@_date: 2019-10-26 01:22:15
I'll never learn to stop waiting for it to drop more!
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:13:17

Dude it's literally spiking up and down by 5-700 at some stages. Raging I have no funds ready on my account
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:33:16
So did I last night now it's dropped 1k �� trying to stock up another 5 now ��

Christ I need this �� imagine stamping hundreds of 20's just to see if you ever get one back someday
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:27:29
I bought some last night and now I need to wait for my transfer to happen to get more :( I bet it will go back up by the time my deposit clears
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:30:10
Buy a ledger nano
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:33:08
That's the problem. Anything can happen in the market now while we wait. I don't really fancy leaving lots of cash on coinbase just to be safe.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:41:46
I know you weren't. Sorry I don't mean to sound like I'm having a go :) was just wondering if it's safe to leave funds on the coinbase app for quick access
@_date: 2019-09-22 14:43:16
You reckon not to buy then �� I was considering adding today
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:02:08
Patiently waiting for my funds to hit coinbase.. �� how long do we think this dip will last?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:11:26
I'm raging I haven't got my account ready to go.. price will be back up by tomorrow :(
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:12:52
Let me put it this way - how will you feel in 6months, 1 year, 5 years time if you sell and bitcoin hits 20-50-100k?
Technically speaking you haven't lost anything until you sell. 
Maybe others would advise you to sell but you definitely need to talk with the wife
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:29:37
How do you have cash ready to buy if it's not stored on coinbase? For eg. I had nothing in my account today and now I can't buy any BTC because it will take a day or 2 for funds to reach my account.
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:13:46
Yeah.. unless there's a faster way I don't know about? ��
