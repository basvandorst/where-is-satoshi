If the HK people are protesting the Bank of China, it is safe to say that they are looking for alternatives. If people are waking up to the idea that they need separation of money and state, they should be open to exploring cryptocurrency. If we agree that "It is and it does" than it is natural to assume that some of the protesters will move their value from Chinese fiat into cryptocurrency. I understand that the video doesn't mentions Bitcoin, but I would argue that this post has much more to do with Bitcoin than the hourly meme posts about the price. Also, considering this it the most upvoted post of the day, most people agree this has significance to Bitcoin.

I understand where the hate comes from, yet I still don't think it's really warranted. Those machines cost money, the crypto bought to load the machines is highly volatile, there is legal, compliance, money logistics, and profit to consider. 
If I can go buy a 3 liter of Coke from Sams and pay a certain amount per ounce, should I bash all the people who pay a 200% mark up at a gas station for a 12oz can? No, there is a convenience fee. 
Another example, I can trade currencies online with Forex for low fees, but when I fly down to Cabo and hand my USD to a Mexican for Pesos, I expect to pay 5-10% fees. Convenience.

For example, if I sell a vehicle to someone for $10K cash and we both choose to write $1 on the cash sale deed, and we choose not to report the $10K on our taxes, we have ^1 *done, given, or acting of one's own free will* to not pay taxes on that transaction. There are potential repercussions, but if you believe this is not done daily you are being very naive. People choose to cheat taxes very regularly. Have you heard of the Paradise Papers? 
Edit: Do you disagree that driving the speed limit is voluntary? This argument is silly.

That’s not a dumb question at all. The machines actually can do that but current money transmittion laws are not clear if it is legal or not. In other words, if you hand me cash and I give you Bitcoin in one transaction, that is just a trade of goods and doesn’t require a money transmittion license. But if you give me cash and I take that cash a go to an exchange and buy Bitcoin with that cash, then come back to you and give you the Bitcoin that would be considered money transmission because I would be holding your money for a period of time. These laws were written before Bitcoin so they are open to interpretation, even though setting up an API sounds reasonable to us, it might not to a 70 yr old judge.
Edit: I guess I should have mentioned, applying for a money transmittion license (per state) can be prohibitively expensive and opens you up much much more scrutiny.

There is no real difference. The words: gambling, investing, and speculating have different connotations but they are are synonymous.

They have to preload the machine with Bitcoin. 3-5% would be fair if the price was always going up,  but when the price is dropping they could be taking a loss at those rates. The machines cost around $10K and then there is the rent for the space in the store. Paying an armored truck or employee to pick up the money and attorney fees for contracts, compliance, etc. I know some BATM owners, they charge 15% but they only net about 2 or 3%.

When you say USD is backed by the government, what do you mean? If USD completely fails will the US government be inslaved to whomever it defaults to? Will it forfeit all of its land and assets? This mentality, that the USD is back by something is what gives the worthless paper notes any value...
Bitcoin is backed by math. It doesn’t need any government to”back” it. You don’t get it. The fact that your money needs to be backed by a government shows just how worthless your paper notes are.

I agree it doesn't matter if I support USD. I never claimed it did. I only pointed out that government printed notes have no intrinsic value. I do feel like I am living a fantasy though, thanks to crypto I’m retired and traveling all the time. I traded in my inflationary money for crypto, it’s working for me. Enjoy losing 3% a year, but I’m out.

USD produces no income and has no intrinsic value. 
If you buy Apple stock, you are gambling, investing, speculating that the price will go up in value more than whatever you sold to buy Apple stock.

Bitcoin is not accepted at Starbucks. Similarly I could "spend Bitcoin at Starbuck" before with my Bitpay Visa debit card, which also is not spending Bitcoin at Starbucks. The title is misleading and and commented calling it out. This article is more than Bitcoin news.

Some of the world's biggest retailers have begun accepting cryptocurrency payments in the form of bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash and the Gemini dollar.
US-based payments startup Flexa has enabled Amazon-owned Whole Foods, Nordstrom, Starbucks and dozens of other companies to take bitcoin payments. 
More than 10 years after bitcoin was founded, user adoption remains one of the biggest challenges still facing the world's largest cryptocurrency. To solve this, Flexa built an app called Spedn, which allows cryptocurrency holders to make instant payments to merchants that accepts Flexa as a payment provider.
"The Flexa team has decades of payments experience, and at this point, we believe that the best way for global commerce to become more efficient and accessible is by bringing cryptocurrency to the masses," the company wrote in a blog post last year.
"By making cryptocurrencies spendable in mainstream commerce, our sincere hope is that we can help bring the full promise of blockchain technologies to people all over the world."
Flexa claims that Spedn will not only benefit consumers who want to spend cryptocurrency, but also the merchants who accept it. "Accepting cryptocurrencies in their stores [will] reduce payment fraud and processing costs," the startup stated.
No additional hardware or software is needed on the retailers' side in order to integrate the payments, they only need to allow Flexa to be a new payment provider on their existing systems.
For customers, the process of paying is similar to existing digital payment methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Once the Spedn app is downloaded, payments can be made by scanning an automatically generated QR code to the payments terminal at the till.
One of the other issues facing cryptocurrency in its quest to become a mainstream form of payment is price volatility. Recent positive news in the cryptocurrency space, for example, has seen the price of bitcoin shoot up by around $2,000 over the last two days - which Flexa's announcement may well have contributed to.
To counter this, Flexa has partnered with New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini so that payments can be made using a so-called stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.
Flexa has only announced a limited list of retailers, which include Whole Foods, Nordstrom and Lowes. However videos shared online also show Starbucks accepting cryptocurrency payments through the app.
In total, around 100 merchants are expected to accept cryptocurrency payments through the Flexa app by the end of the year, totalling more than 30,000 stores.
Eventually, Flexa wants to make it possible for any shop to accept any cryptocurrency.
"As the Flexa network grows, we hope to show the world just how transformative cryptocurrencies can be for all kinds of payments, not just peer-to-peer transactions, but also retail paumnets, dining and beyond," Flexa's announcement stated.
"The world of payments is evolving quickly now, and we believe that Flexa will be a massive part of the shift toward more efficient and more accessible commerce around the globe."

Your feedback is anonymous, the only reason he knew it was you was because you immediately left the feedback, so he saw the new feedback and assumed it was you. I always wait a few days or even weeks before roasting someone, that way they shouldn't know who it was. Also, if he cancelled the trade, his feedback should be "unconfirmed" which means other people will not see it.

If we are looking at $250K Bitcoin by 2022, then he is correct that getting in at the previous ATH is still a good time to enter the market long term. Obliviously, now is better.
