There is a bitcoin atm i can withdraw from only 3 miles from me, but i would lose ~$200 in fees taking that route.
@_date: 2016-04-09 06:23:30
Sorry i just thought this is something alot of people know about and wasn't worthy of being over other bitcoin news.

Tried them all, VIABTC is the only one that ever works and ive tried 4-5 times a day for 4 days in a row on the hour. Bitcoin is a serious headache to use now. The only thing its good for is looking at it, its almost unusable as a currency now.

Pretty sure thats whats happned. Nice $822 lesson learned today weeeee and i just put it in that wallet last night to sell today lol
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:05:42
do you have any recommendations for a wallet app for the iphone i can use at my bitcoin atm? I'm jaded by my blockchain app now.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:12:31
I did, i cannot see the adresses of my randomly generated"mybitcoinwallets" private keys, I can see what adresses i have used through pubx but those dont appear in my adress list and have an option to find the key
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:58:17
Thanks everyone so far, the adress he sent my coins to is this 1GFGHwQGtgYThXzfcMjrtbcDa42UuYqJ7o . I was awake from about 5 am to 9 am doing everything i could , Enabling 2fa and creating new stronger emails/passwords for anything and everything now. It's a huge bummer this was so easy for someone. This has been a not so fun lesson for me but i can say ive already learned a ton more about the currency i love so much because of this. Just like anything else, don't half ass it when it comes to personal security.

realy wish i knew, whoeve hacked me chenged my password on a reallly old wallet i never even used too.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:03:50
no, pretty sure my comp is being fished. Keylogged most likely 
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:53:59
yea pretty brutal. i'm getting emails from everywhere ive had a wallet someone changing my passwords on wallets i dont even use. What the hell is going on and how?
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:27:49
I've been waiting almost 3'hours now for one confirmation - pushed + decent fee 
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:18:28
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:11:02
hope so, its been over two hours now and was rather time sensative. doh
@_date: 2016-10-24 22:34:53
ok, very odd to me. Have never waited more than 30 minutes and ive done 1000s of transactions over the years.
@_date: 2016-10-24 22:48:52
sorry i need to edit that, i meant 30 minutes
@_date: 2016-10-24 23:02:54
I'm at 97 minutes on one transaction, and 113 minutes on the other. That back up seems huge
