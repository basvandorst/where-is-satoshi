"I doubt the average Joe will be happy to be told they're getting paid less next month, even if that doesn't actually mean their purchasing power decreases."
I'm not sure how happy the average Joe is to get zero or maybe a 1% cost of living increase when headline inflation is running closer to 3% despite the government pretending 2% is their target. and true inflation which includes necessities like housing is probably running triple that.

Upvoted for an example of how not to store your private keys. Your brother should have been the failsafe though. SFYL
Edit: hey I just realized do you remember what computer you used to print that private key? Where would that computer be right now?
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:31:47
Why not? When I trade Bitcoin on exchanges the symbol is BTC. Furthermore pretty much the entire world incl ALL exchanges except you bcash people use the word Bitcoin to describe the coin that is purchased when you purchase BTC. Every exchange I go on and buy BTC tell me what coin I'm getting?
It would be like Nissan calling the Rogue a Porsche Cayenne. Then making a Cayenne subreddit, and Porsche website all about how they should buy a Porsche Cayenne, and then shipping the Nissan Rogue. I'm sure it fits into the definition of insanity and/or fraud. You people are fucking nuts.

I am not a ledger shill, but in light of the following I would probably choose Ledger over trezor at the moment.
tldr: hacker with $100 worth of equipment can extract the 24 word seed from a trezor in mere minutes. Therefore the company suggests always use a 25th word or passphrase. However I would be concerned if somebody could extract the 24 word seed and return the device and you would never know it therefore buying them all the time they needed to work on the passphrase. I'm not saying Ledger is perfect, but at the moment it does seem the more secure of the two.
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:29:08
Well for starters there is Quadriga CX. And any other exchange that was running a Ponzi. Anytime an exchange runs a Ponzi there is more Bitcoin for sale than there is in existence. This follows mathematically.

@_date: 2019-07-29 09:17:50
I see no nuance. Ledger never claimed that "Joe Schmo" could do this in 5 seconds if they pick up your device. The fact that they can do it at all in minutes with $100 worth of equipment is enough to completely destroy my faith that if I were to misplace the device for a time that nothing was extracted. Let's not underestimate motivated black hat hackers in this day and age. It is pretty much guaranteed the black hats are working on this right now to replicate Ledger's findings and you can be sure they are not going to announce it when they are successful. The first time we hear about it is when people's devices start to get hit.
Telling everybody they need to use a passphrase and that that completely mitigates this problem is literally absurd. 
Edit to the fanboys who downvoted this: 
Feel free to publish your own 24 word seed now so everybody has it and can work on cracking your passphrase at their leisure. Kind of obviates the whole BIP39 1 in 1.16 * 10^77  peace of mind no?

Bro I literally just posted this exact thing as a comment last night. Absolutely the number of Bitcoin being traded far exceeds the actual number of Bitcoin in circulation. Look at exchanges like now defunct Quadriga CX and of course any other ponzi exchange. I bet many exchanges are running some kind of fractional-reserve.

GBTC is like holding paper gold. If there's ever a run on the bank there will not be enough Bitcoin for everybody who "owns" it. Actually I think holding your Bitcoin on an exchange poses  pretty much the same risk. I was thinking there are probably about 50 million Bitcoin for sale right now around the world. Going to be a bit of a problem when everybody wants to withdraw to their hardware wallets considering there's maybe a third of that in actual coin in existence.

24 word seeds are better, but 12 words is still pretty secure. This is because each BIP39 word can be one of 2,048 possible choices and 2048^12  is approximately 5.44 * 10^39. Like winning the Powerball lottery (1/292 million) five times - in a row. Even allowing for the fact that there is a checksum does not really change these odds substantially. 1 in 2.13 * 10^37.

Buying low and selling high repeatedly only works until all of a sudden it doesn't and when that happens you lose all of your gains and then some instantly. Just look at those massive vertical green candles  followed by massive vertical red candles every once in awhile  right out of the blue.

I'm going to keep my eye on that Cold Card Wallet. I've also been thinking for awhile that the Ledger is really a medium term solution unless they open up more of their source as last year they were actually alluding that they might do. Meanwhile I believe the Trezor is more open source, but at the moment I do love my ledger, and I don't think it's quite urgent to make the switch yet. I think we could see what Ledger does with their firmware policies. If they eventually open up their firmware that would go a long way in my mind. Seems a little doubtful that they're going to do it though.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:44:30
I was actually referring to the fact that ledger the company could update their firmware to harvest everybody's private keys. They have admitted as much in Reddit posts, but they mentioned that it would require the unlikely collusion of a number of the employees there and further that they are not motivated to do something like that since it could essentially destroy the crypto market. It's a bit of a scary thought though considering the firmware is closed source on a ledger and entirely in the control of one company.
@_date: 2018-08-26 07:38:46
Your entire post is a very good argument against personally selecting one's own words from the bip39 list. You can also make a "brain wallet" by randomly selecting the seed words per usual and then memorizing that random list in which case good luck trying to guess it.

Q1. Bitcoin's slow network
A. Lightning network.
Q2. High transaction costs
A. Lightning network.
Q3. Increased competition
A. Bitcoin will always be the first and best known. There are a few major currencies in the world that coexist, same with crypto. 10,000 shitcoins aren't going to replace Bitcoin, just like the Zimbabwe ZWD is not going to replace USD or CAD or Euro.
Q4. The innovation is the blockchain, not bitcoin
A. The innovation is the smartphone, not Apple. The innovation is online retail, not Amazon. The innovation is online search, not Google. But I think those companies are doing okay.
Q5. Wild volatility makes for a poor store of value
A. The DJIA hit a market low of 6,443.27 on March 6, 2009, having lost over 54% of its value since the October 9, 2007 high. Yet that is where the safe investors put their money for example Warren Buffett.
Q6. Increased regulations
A. Every investment that has any chance of making money is or will be heavily regulated. Tax package from online stock broker last year few hundred pages long.
Q7. Too expensive too [sic] mine
A. Economics. If that were really true a bunch of miners would quit and the reward per miner goes up. Then it would no longer be true.
Q8. Not secure enough
A. This could mean many things. In the article, they talk about an exchange being hacked, no insurance. Increasingly crypto exchanges are insured, for example Coinbase. They mention if you lose your key you're fucked. Granted. But that's also an advantage and quite intentional, in that the government cannot take your crypto whenever it wants to like it can take everything else you own, to pay whatever debt it assigns you. That is the great trade off and honestly one of the great things about crypto.

Arbitrage keeps a coin's price correlated on different exchanges. If some whale starts buying on Exchange A, arbitrageurs will jump on Exchanges B C and D to buy up cheaper coins, move them to Exchange A to sell to the whale. This action narrows that gap until the arbitrage advantage has been eliminated.
For less accessible exchanges you might see a premium for example Golix in Zimbabwe.

It depends on whether that transaction would be added back into the mempool after having been initially confirmed. That I am not sure about but it does seem possible that the coffee shop could rebroadcast the original transaction. Therefore the safest course of action for the scammer is literally to spend the coins twice so there is nothing left for the coffee shop i e double spend.

From everything I hear people saying, you need to reconnect with the latest state and then close it. So if you're unable to do that as a few people have posted they are unable to, BTC appears to be lost. I want to open a lightning node but I don't feel like risking a sizable amount of BTC to earn a couple satoshi's when I could lose the whole thing. We need clarity on this.
@_date: 2019-03-30 05:45:31
It really would. I'll be honest I'm on the edge of setting up a lightning node myself but that is one of the reasons I haven't done it yet knowing that if something goes wrong and I lose the ability to connect the funds are just gone until the other channel closes and what if that channel loses connection then it seems like the funds are simply lost forever. It's a feature they really need to add auto close channels when it stops getting pinged from either node.

"But when the whole Network receives Bobs 2 Blocks, won't the miners try to mine the coffee transaction into the next Block, because the transaction is not yet included in the Blockchain."
Sure but actually what Bob did is he created another transaction in his private chain where he sent all the funds in that address to another address that he controls. So when the coffee transaction is attempted to be re-added there will be insufficient funds. So he got to drink the cup of coffee for free and his funds are safu.

I would throw the 1.5k in right away as it's not that much. That way you have your position. Then if you get a nice dip you'll probably find a little extra money to top it up but if we don't get that dip at least you have your position. If 1.5 k were absolutely all you will ever be able to afford then of course put less in initially save the powder for a dip. But I suspect you'd find a bit more if we got a really nice dip after your initial buy in.

You do not need to trust him. If you have the public address you simply paste it into a blockchain explorer. Make sure that the balance is still zero at that receive address, or at least has not changed since before you sent the money. 
Also please try pasting the addresses into the send field in Electrum as the malware may be smart enough not to change it if it's just into Notepad.
ps. You should also double-check you do not have a malware version of electrum wallet. Please make sure you downloaded it from the official source.

One is the change address. One is the scammer's address if you were scammed, or anyway recipient if you made a mistake. If you do not recognize either one of those addresses then it sounds like clipboard malware maybe. Interesting that right now it doesn't seem to be changing your address anymore though. In any case the block Explorer is telling you that your friend is correct he did not receive the funds.
If I were you I would search your hard drive and recent websites for the addresses that you sent it to to see if you might have copied it and pasted it from some other source, and if you can find it maybe talk to the recipient about returning it. Maybe last option.

Obviously if you cannot find the address then you would not know the recipient. Anyway it's probably your last option.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:53:23
Ok you need to enter the address that you actually tried to send the money to. Your friend's address he gave you enter it into block Explorer and see what that says. That is the one you want to check in Block Explorer.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:01:33
Well that's a problem because he can say he did not receive it even if he did. I don't see how you would not have access to his address anymore? In any case putting that aside for a moment, try copying any public Bitcoin address into your clipboard and then paste it into a notepad. You want to see if the address changes. You can just grab an address from your Electrum receive list.

"The counterfeits in these cases are subtler: The gold is real, and very high purity, with only the markings faked. Fake-branded bars are a relatively new way to flout global measures to block conflict minerals and prevent money-laundering. Such forgeries pose a problem for international refiners, financiers and regulators as they attempt to purge the world of illicit trade in bullion."
So it seems that the gold is actually real but it is associated with criminal organizations or sanctioned countries. Sort of like dirty Bitcoin but I'm not sure how big a problem that is. Haven't checked my own. Funny how both gold bugs and crypto people like to tout the word fungibility. But this is a good example that in fact neither is truly fungible the purest sense of the word.

With BC hydro there are two price tiers but in fact when you use more power you actually pay a higher rate. This obviously did not help when I was mining ethereum. So OP would need to find a place where bulk power is at a lower price instead of a higher price.

Ouch bro. Well I remember turning it down at $100 because I looked at the chart and saw that it had previously tanked from $33 to $2. So my logic was it could easily go from $100 down to $1 it's just totally random. Had I spent 5 minutes to actually read up on it I probably would have been hooked but I was only looking at it at all because a friend was bugging me to throw some money in. Like you said hindsight is 20/20. I did finally jump in almost 2 years ago my Bitcoin birthday is coming up on Halloween ��.
Congrats on investing! Me myself I just btfd the past couple days. The price is almost exactly my cost so I figured why not add a few more sats.
@_date: 2019-10-04 06:19:53
You have a lot of things going for you. When I mined ethereum I was at the mercy of BC Hydro which continually jack their rates. You have free power. Free rent is also invaluable for a farm that big. Although I suppose you could see the 10% your friend is taking as rent/power but because it is a percentage of what your take is pretty much means you will remain profitable on a daily basis.
Your biggest enemy is the never ending increase in difficulty/ hash rate just like with eth, plus newer hardware to compete with. ROI could keep walking away from you if you had to pay for power. Right now it's 312 days, maybe next month it will be 350 days, then eventually it becomes infinity because your outdated hardware can only mine at a loss. 
In your case with free power as long as the machines don't all break down, you can just keep clawing your way towards roi. So free power cannot be  underestimated.  But you might want to consider  how secure is your free power  could that be taken away? 
Anyway if I were you I would expect true roi to be at least double what you estimate today due to the never ending increase in hash rate, so maybe ballpark it at 2 years. That is in fact the reason I have not got into Bitcoin mining myself, without free power I would not expect to ever get roi.
Anyway good luck!

@_date: 2019-10-30 14:58:19
I think it really boils down to volatility. If you take any chart of any stock or commodity and pick a random point on that chart, the probability that at some point the price will revisit that level is probably close to 100%. That means if there happens to be a gap produced at that level it is almost 100% it will get filled. Yes it can be filled later on as volatility happens at many different time scales. 
I'm actually curious what that probability of revisiting a randomly-selected price point really is. In any case such volatility is not unique to Bitcoin, and the fact that the futures gap gets filled is an effect rather than a cause. I'll probably run some numbers when I have time next day or two.

My crypto birthday is Halloween 2017 when I finally listened to that voice that was eating away at me for half the year. Sure wish I would have listened earlier but it is what it is. Since then I've bought more all the way up and back down even a little bit below ended up averaging a hair under 10,000 Canadian I guess that's about 7,500 US.

The main difference would be that the recipient would have to pay to receive the funds back to on chain unless they already had a Lightning Network wallet and were happy to keep and spend funds directly from that wallet. Eventually when LN is mainstream and pretty much everybody has a channel / ln wallet this would not be an issue because people will just keep the funds they received in their ln wallet and spend that from there as cash. Presently though the recipient of Bitcoin likely wants to get that back to on chain Bitcoin.

You are thinking that we have yet to see capitulation. However I believe we may have seen that earlier this year with $3,000 BTC. There are a lot of people wishing they BTFD but did not because they believed it could just simply keep plunging. I'm sorry to say I am one who did not take advantage of the $3,000 BTC. That I believe was capitulation and therefore the floor. Now you have to expect growing optimism as you enter bull market coming off that floor and I do not believe growing optimism has to be bearish. We cannot remain in a perpetual state of capitulation. 
Another difference between Bitcoin and other assets is you have the hodlers of last resort. I will simply never sell and the more we accumulate the less will be in the market excepting of course the inflation rate. I admit though this market is also somewhat ruled by the mega whales who often don't hodl. Anyway we shall see!

"But that won't get them a 'safe' 6% interest rate. And what happens when the trades go bad? 
I think the whole thing is a big disaster waiting to happen. Same principle as always applies--if it sounds too good to be true...."
I agree these deals are antithetical to the not your keys not your Bitcoin mantra. It's tempting to think I could increase my holdings so easily but the second their risky trade at &gt;6% goes against them there's not going to be enough to pay out everyone and then all of a sudden it silently becomes a fractional reserve which half these guys probably already are running. It's a game of musical chairs with your precious Bitcoin.

Really doesn't take long it just generates a list of possible mnemonics one of which must be the case. It is then up to you to actually check that valid list in electrum or some other way in order to check balances to determine which of those possibilities is your wallet.

No, I meant if somebody generates a random wallet that was checksum validated and uses 24 bip39 words, the probability that that matches your wallet is 1.13 * 10^-77. If the word list is different it will point to a different wallet.

That's great I was thinking last night I should add that functionality. One concern though is that it is checking these online rather than offline. But in that direction I am going to add a filter if one knows a publicly used Bitcoin address they have received money to. That way they do not have to wade through the short list of mnemonics but it can still run offline.

If people don't like something it doesn't mean they're whining. there's going to be a hurdle to convince people like me and by the way I love Bitcoin and have no love for bcash believe me. 
When it comes to widespread adoption I could see lightning network working because that would be my spendable money in that wallet and enough merchants would accept it that that would make sense to hold and use that currency. I guess the point I was making was we are not there yet so if OP wants to try to use lightning network and his customers don't feel like doing that it's not going to work very well whereas lots of people today would accept Bitcoin directly on chain. For ln we need adoption to spur on adoption I suppose.

for 1 you just need the most basic dos command like so. Suppose you had unzipped your python your python-mnemonic folder onto the D drive root. then in Windows command prompt:
CD d:\python-mnemonic
checkme.py &gt;wordlists.txt
 If you get an unknown command you either do not have python installed or you are not in the correct folder that has checkme.py in it.
Please see the above instructions in the source comments that tell you where to find Python and you have to install it or this will not run. But it is just one installer, it should not be overly complicated.
3. find the wordlists.txt file in Windows and open it in Notepad.
Hope it helps!

No in fact it is the destination address that is the critical point. Because that is the address that now holds the coins. So if that is not your friend's address but perhaps an exchange or somebody else then you need to ask them to follow the instructions in that link which basically involves importing the private key for one coin into the wallet for the other coin and then spending those mistakenly sent coins from that other wallet in a refund to your friend.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:50:16
Wouldn't all of the recipients also need to open Lightning Network channels? So the person receiving that $5 would have to open a channel and then close it afterwards thereby spending a lot of money relative to the five bucks they received? I feel like that is the major limitation of the Lightning Network the fact that in order to use it you have to open a channel and fund it.

Wow that is very interesting and point taken, as the Bitcoin white paper is indeed a published paper. 
Edit: I think it would probably be a fight though as the government would claim that a book that is libelous or slanderous or conspiratorial would not be protected for example. So there are exceptions. They would probably try to claim that it is conspiratorial against national interests. But it definitely is a plus for Bitcoin and if they could not pull that off with pgp I doubt they could do so with Bitcoin.

I mentioned bcash because their whole shtick is they don't need a second layer solution and therefore you can keep your money safe on chain without having to put it in a channel that the developers even attach a # Reckless to. Yes I do realize bcash is a joke and was just 51% attacked and is in no way safe LOL. But my point is this is going to be people's thinking until lightning network is Rock Solid and more widely adopted. When that happens sure it will make sense for OP to require his customers to have lightning wallets. But at this point it does not make sense for op to require that of his customers it would be like me demanding that my American health care provider accept my Canadian pesos. Then I would tell them hey you can just convert it back to American dollars unless you want to use the Canadian dollar merchants.
And no if somebody doesn't like something that does not mean they're whining. In fact if anything you sound like the one who is whining when in reality you should be trying to promote not attack if you care that much.

Okay here is what I can gather by studying these two histories:
For brevity, I will refer below to these addresses as 1dc and SWr respectively.
The first transaction you made according to CEX was for 0.05 BTC on 9.12.2017. That tx does not appear at SWr at all, ONLY at 1dc. Do you agree with CEX that you made that deposit for .05 BTC on 9.12.2017? If so, why is it not on the blockchain for SWr, only 1dc? SWr history begins on 9.19.2017. If so you MUST have deposited .05 BTC to somewhere other than SWr (blockchain is irrefutable; nothing before 9.19.2017 to SWr).
Based on that, it seems possible that they accidentally changed your displayed deposit address a couple times on their GUI around Sept 2017 during/ shortly after their swap over to new addresses. I have seen far too many bugs in very expensive commercial software and platforms to believe they could not have possibly made a mistake. Can you please find a record of the 0.05 tx on YOUR end? Binance, coinbase, somewhere else? Seems like this may point you in the right direction, given it is a tx that does not appear at SWr at all. I do think that one you may have deposited into 1dc.
Regarding the following, duplicate txs, maybe they allowed some grace period (overlap) during which deposits into OLD addresses were credited to the new ones, for each account. Now, they currently claim you always only ever had the new 1dc, but again, I think probably you had \*both\* in their system, during some overlapping grace period, and at times you were shown the older one on your GUI.
If the GUI showed to you 1dc originally, so you deposited .05 there, then later on it glitched and showed you SWr for a time (an older linked address in their db), and that was when you saved SWr to Binance etc. and have used it ever since, then all your deposits into SWr were auto-credited to 1dc by their system, up until the grace period for switching to new addresses expired. Thereafter they disowned the older addresses incl. SWr.
Possibly that is how this happened. You need to escalate to a programmer / supervisor higher up or further in than just front line CS, for something like this. Suggest this chain of events to them and see if they can dig deeper. Ask them if there was a grace priod for \*other\* clients who had old and new addresses. I think the key is those duplicate entries, e.g, you deposit 0.85 into SWr, and the exact same amount is auto-credited to 1dc. Show them ALL of those you can find on the blockchain, and suggest the possibility that this may have worked for a while due to their grace period for switching deposit addresses. Their first response to this will be, “No your account was born in Sept, so you only ever had 1dc”. That is a front line CS reply. Get someone higher up who can think, and suggest the possibility of system display or database issues during the swap over, during which your account may have owned both 1dc AND SWr.
Hope it helps you at least begin to craft a dialogue with a programmer/ supervisor deeper in their systems than just front line CS. You need that level of dialogue to get this solved.

Have you ever successfully sent Bitcoin with Ledger live or just other cryptos? I wonder if you used a passphrase before (25th word) and now you're not using that passphrase? Because that I think would allow the seed to be approved but would show a zero balance. Otherwise I just have no idea. These stories are so concerning to me. I guess the next thing I would try is order a brand new Ledger Nano s and try to initialize that device on a completely new computer.
I put off using Ledger live as long as possible. Only recently did I install it and I've only made a single etherium transaction, pretty much the safest transaction I could do considering I already knew my receive address from before. I really hope you can solve this.
@_date: 2018-11-10 07:49:50
If upon reseting the Nano accepted your 24 words then it is unlikely you wrote down the wrong seed considering that only 1 in 256 combinations would be accepted. So going under the assumption that your seed is the correct one you used in the first place.
When was the last time you successfully sent any crypto from that device and was it when you were using the Chrome apps or Ledger Live?

QuadrigaCX you can trade both directions
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:09:07
I think it's pretty much the same thing. Let's say you buy $1,000 worth of BTC and deposit at address a. Then you make a transaction to address b. That address may hold more BTC. Then address b sends it to some illegal website address c. The owner of address c then gets busted. Then by examining the transactions associated with address c, eventually leads them back to address a and then to your name. On the other hand if it can be demonstrated that somebody else owns address b, perhaps your custody of the coins ended before the illegal purchase. Maybe you bought somebody's car for BTC and then they made the purchase at c.

It really does.

You begin to ask yourself should I just leave the coins on etherdelta forever rather than spend more than the coins are worth in attempts to get them off, because every failed attempt eats more gas. Horrible.

Well a good investor can begin to identify an amazing opportunity that he is not taking advantage of. That can begin to gnaw away at said investor. More and more news can come out  in favor of this new investment.  Every negative news that comes out against it,  causes just a temporary dip but is then quickly overcome. Finally when Futures are announced indicating a definite mass adoption, said investor can decide to make the intelligent decision to invest in this new class that obviously has huge potential upside. Said investor would limit said investment to an amount that the investor can afford to lose i e will not cause financial ruin in the event that this investment goes south. But the intelligent move eventually became 100% clear to put some money on it.

I have a rule when investing. If you make a mistake and you have identified it correct it quick even if it costs a couple thousand bucks. Because if you don't correct it it eventually can cost tens of thousands and that gap can just keep growing. Once you identify a mistake, just think damage control and eat the small loss.

Thank you for adding that additional point. I normally only check the first couple and last couple but I believe I will have to start checking the middle few characters as well. I guess also wise to check enough characters total that it becomes mathematically too difficult for the attacker to match that many. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:34:30
That sounds like a very malicious malware and I'm not even sure they're actually stealing the coins rather than just making you lose them. I say that because they left the first few characters the same as your actual destination address so obviously nobody in the universe has control over that wallet address nor will they ever almost certainly. So the malware simply took those coins right out of circulation.
EDIT: responses below have corrected me. Looks like the author of the malware could easily have control of those destination addresses, so it was indeed theft.
The only help I might offer in response to your question is if I pick up some malware or get some really messed up Windows I just do a fresh image. If you don't have an image saved then I guess a reinstall of windows but I always prefer clean install rather than trust removal of a confirmed malware.
 Best of luck and I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your coins.

I believe Frankenmint's point was that if the large miners quit then the smaller miners could pick up the slack presumably because of a difficulty adjustment. But you raise a good point that we might never get to that difficulty adjustment if everybody just up and quit all at once because we would lack the hash power to get through those two thousand blocks.

It is not that Bitcoin holds its value against the US dollar. The more accurate interpretation is that it holds its value as measured by purchase power of goods and services, and assets such as houses. The US dollar (and in fact all fiat currencies) is slowly but surely losing its purchase power on the other hand and sometime in the not-so-distant future will rapidly lose it as hyperinflation takes hold resulting from the vertical QE chart and negative interest rate plague taking over the globe. Network effect and scarcity are inherently valuable (Bitcoin). The US dollar can hardly gain network effect at this point and is anything but scarce.

etherdelta is a decentralized exchange, but a very crappy one. A total shit-show. Admittedly I only traded there briefly, trying to buy some shit coins with some spare ETH for fun (given that up now; I like my ETH). Transferring the ETH in or out was a nightmare. It will tell you transaction did not go through, yet they still take your gas from your ETH account (you will see on etherscan.io). Or transaction did go through it will say, yet it will not actually move anything (except again take your gas). It will ALWAYS take your gas, but only complete the transaction itself 1/10 times. Once your coins are on etherdelta good luck ever getting them off without spending half the money in lost gas fees. In my brief foray in and out of trading shit coins on etherdelta,  I lost about 0.4 ETH almost entirely in fees (started with 2 ETH play money and quit with 1.6 left after liquidating the shit coins). If you must try trading shit coins, try googling to find any other decentralized exchange.

I'm invested in Bitcoin but yeah I will play devil's advocate. A long time ago someone was trying to get me into Amway and made the argument that only a pretty small percentage of people are actually Amway salesman so look at the potential growth opportunity. But what that did not account for however was the fact that 100% of the population already heard about Amway and the vast majority would never become an Amway salesman underneath your pyramid. While it was true that only 5% of people are Amway salesman, the other 95% already heard about it and pretty firmly rejected it. Not exactly the growth opportunity they were trying to sell. Given that pretty much everybody on Earth has now heard about Bitcoin and knows what cryptocurrency is, one could I suppose make the same argument. That said, I think the impending collapse of the fiat currency system globally is what is going to propel the value of Bitcoin to the next level.

That foreign buyers tax did nothing because the Canadian government invites 300,000 wealthy immigrants per year. Most of those come from China and the vast majority of those settle in one city, Vancouver BC. Big surprise they cannot add enough housing stock to keep up with those inflows. Foreign buyers tax does not apply to new permanent residents. These people bring huge amounts of money  earned in China yet that money is treated as local. Actual local incomes cannot hope to compete. 
Bottom line: We need to reduce immigration here but it will never happen under any Canadian party.

Currently Bitcoin has two and a half times the inflation I've gold as measured by stock to flow. However next year  the two will be comfortable,  and by 2025 that will essentially be reversed with Bitcoin having double the stock to flow.

"Is there a reason the dollar can’t gain network effect? The majority of it exists digitally anyway, right?"
In fact USD more likely will lose network effect. Network effect is defined as the value inherent in the number or more accurately the proportion of the population making use of that network. 
As certain countries will begin to abandon the US dollar as the reserve currency, the network effect will actually shrink rather than grow. 
Since it is already pretty much at maximum capacity and other countries consider dropping the US dollar as the reserve currency, downward is the most likely direction.
To your second question, imagine if Bitcoin is the only currency and it is in fact slightly deflationary eventually. By the way at the moment Bitcoin is still slightly inflationary and will remain so for another hundred twenty years. But even if it were slightly deflationary, and people when they work only get paid in Bitcoin, there are certain things people are going to need to live for example people need to buy a house, drive a car, buy a new TV, go out to eat. They're not going to live in the streets hoarding their crypto and live homeless their whole lives because they're too afraid to spend. Will a slightly deflationary currency reign in *excessive* spending? Yes it will. But it will not stop all spending. 
The problem with the current economy and the endless printing of money and now onset globally of negative interest rates, is it is entirely based on gross excessive spending far above one's means.

I am certainly not an economist, but the way I see it, people will work for a living just like they do now, but be paid in Bitcoin, even far in the future when hyperbitcoinization is here. At that time, yes some will be very rich (just like now), and the working class's wages might be very low in nominal Bitcoin terms (maybe a few satoshis) but the buying power of those wages could be exactly the same. Right now wages go up not down, but prices go up too, often faster. Inflation is not generally good for poor people, Venezuela being an example, wages are not keeping pace there, many less extreme examples where wages do not keep pace with inflation. In the end game, there might be less BTC to go around so to speak, but things will cost less also, I'm not sure real wages will be lower.

If you only invested 12000 I would try to refinance your mortgage and lump the 12,000 in there if you are having trouble making the payments on the 12,000. Amortized over say 25 years or whatever your mortgage is that should make a miniscule impact on your monthly mortgage payment. Then you should cut your losses and never return to crypto until you actually have disposable money to put in. No more loans to buy crypto!

Could one not write some software to continually follow these transfers address to address until such time as they make it onto an exchange and then contact the exchange to find out who owns that account? Seems to me you could make a hundred transfers but if you want to cash out it's eventually going to have to hit an exchange. Although I suppose with decentralized exchanges and converting to other coins perhaps eventually following the trail might be impossible. 
Anyway I would be interested to see what this trail actually looks like maybe I'll try to write something myself, admittedly a total noob in crypto programming but a somewhat experienced programmer.

If you live in Canada interest rates are not going to do s***. Why do you think we have the highest housing prices in the world relative to our meagre incomes? It's our brilliant central banker Stephen Poloz and his equally brilliant predecessor Mark Carney. They have looked for every little datum they could find to justify keeping rates at "emergency" levels for two decades. It will never end. The lesson? If you're Canadian, the more debt the better.

1. Cryptocurrencies tend to be deflationary as opposed to fiat currencies which these days are hyperinflationary, see for example the POS Canadian dollar.
2. With a properly guarded private key, no government can ever take your crypto. You can cross any border you want fly around the world and still recover your crypto. Governments can however and oftentimes do seize all sorts of other assets for example bank accounts stocks bonds real estate Etc.
I'm sure there's lots of others but those are my favorite two. GL in debate; you are on the winning side :D.

Probabilities as well as what that alternative scenario looks like are just as important as expected values as I imagine you realize. If somebody offered you 2 billion to 1 payout on a one-in-a-billion lottery actually sounds like a great deal expected value wise. But it's a near-certainty you would lose your investment. Of course in your scenario the alternative is just that Bitcoin hangs out where it is. Not so bad.

Recovery phrase uniquely identifies the wallet. Change the recovery phrase by reinitializing and your device now points to a completely different wallet on the blockchains.

"So unless you expect a recession, it’s better to put your funds in the stock market where you’d double the returns of your home payment."
I actually agree and hold a mortgage myself while simultaneously holding quite a bit of stock. I am thinking more along the lines of in the future if something like Bitcoin replaces fiat currency people will buy houses with Bitcoin. It will not be foolish to buy a house just because you are using Bitcoin or else Bitcoin will indeed not be a form of money at all. That was my point I was trying to make not to become completely mortgage free when you might have other investments you could make. My point was just because your money is Bitcoin does not mean you should not be willing to spend it to purchase assets or else Bitcoin is not money at all.

That's because we are living in the immigration capital of the country in Vancouver. Check out official inflation numbers by region across Canada look it up on statistics Canada's website. When you are looking it up be aware it is a vast understatement they paint as rosy a picture as possible. Even then you'll find Vancouver's inflation rate is the highest in the country pretty much every year. It all boils down to foreign money parking itself here as new landed money. These guys driving $300,000 supercars don't give a shit about a dollar seventy a liter.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:28:11
Figure of speech. Inflation in Vancouver has been running 3% for quite a while. But that number does not include assets like real estate which obviously have gone up far more extremely. Inflation is the government's way of transferring wealth away from the working person. Everybody who really denies its existence are playing right into their hands. Honestly I cannot even believe I'm having this debate with people whether or not inflation is out of control in Vancouver seriously.

@_date: 2019-05-27 02:29:39
I look at it as a purchase of an asset using Bitcoin, not paying fiat-denominated debt per se. If OP's mortgage is half the value of his home, he only owns 50% of his home and the bank owns the other half. Pay off half the mortgage and he now owns 75% of his home. He is buying real estate with Bitcoin. I agree with rampant hyperinflation these days that his mortgage probably goes to 0 in real terms on its own pretty fast though. But if the eventual end game is Bitcoin as global money, people will buy real estate with Bitcoin just as OP is considering. You might think it is too early though.

You are just quoting semantics. The point is inflation on housing here far exceeds the headline number of 2.91%. But even the headline number which the government says they like to keep below 2% is running basically 3% in Vancouver. Obviously we have not hit Venezuela levels but it's pretty bad here. Ask anybody trying to break into the real estate market. This is all the result of perpetually low interest rates and excessive wealth based immigration.
