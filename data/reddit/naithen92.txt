Hey, i wanna give a short  answer as an economist Student myself. I did my bachelor-thesis about cryptocurrencies 2 years ago. I tried to argue if Bitcoin could indeed bei Seen as money and replace out current banking system. And the Definition of money meets 2 points that Bitcoin does not. Money should be able to be used for counting and calculating how mutch Different things cost. The volatility of Bitcoin makes this really Hard. Shops would Need to Change their prices conctantly to meet the fluctuating value of Bitcoin.      And the second point of my research was also due to Bitcoins volatiliy. Money should be able to Store value over time with high certanty. With the current System you might lose 2% due to Inflation but you can be certain about What you can buy in 2 years from now. With Bitcoin you cant. Maybe in will have just crashed and  it need to recover first to your planed value Or i will be factor 100 above What you planed (that would be no Problem indeed).   But still until it will stsbilize bitcoin is not a Good alternative to money.   Bitcoin still awesome thow.
Sorry for the writing german autocorrect Messing with my englisch

Of course it can live Next to our current System and i acutally also mentioned this in my Papier that cryptocurrencies are perfekt for skiping the regular Transaktion fees of the banking system regarding exchanging money. But thsts not the point i wanted to Make. I just wanted to argue that bitcoin doesnt fullfill our expectations wenn have regarding What money has to be. It is still bery usefull.
And to point two. Of course There May be a time wäre crypto is the only form of money and There will be no volatiliy anymore. During that  high volatiliy transition Phase we probably are right now thow, it is in fact not very usefull as money compared to other currencies.

Could we please stop legitimizing bitcoin by pushing it for a dictator?​! This is the kind of sentiment which makes this community look foolish and dangerous and is not helping adoption at all but only to give voice to critics.​

I actually wrote a paper if bitcoin fulfills all the necessary points of being money in college around 2 years ago. The main critique was, that money should make it easy for people to, know somethings worth. If value of bitcoin is fluctuation at the rate it has over the past years, this function is not fulfilled. 
The classic old bitcoin joke is relevant here: A boy asked his Bitcoin-investing dad...
...for $10.00 worth of Bitcoin currency.
Dad: $9.67? What do you need $10.32 for?
This would also apply to goods in a supermarket, if you hypothesise if you could pay there with bitcoin, and would make it a hassle for consumers and sellers.
Of course bitcoin fulfills some functions of being money, like "store of value", but not all of them. Another function is, that you need to be able to transform your wealth from today into the future (and I'm not talking long term). If there is a relatively high chance of the price crashing within a year, than also this function of money is not fulfilled.
I'm not saying bitcoin cannot be money. All this problems center around the volatility, which should resolve itself by mass adoption in the long term. But right now, one could argue bitcoin is not good in being money.
Excited about your replies.
