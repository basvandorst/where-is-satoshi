The scenario I see is the price dropping somewhat, since it seems clear it is a bubble, a bit like ebay c. 1999. But I think that correction will give way to more 'genuine' buyers, i.e. people getting in to use bitcoin for purchases and money transfers, rather than speculation, which will ultimately give it its real worth, probably far higher than it is now.
I hope that the recent $100 drop is the beginning of that.
A lot of funding is going into 4, so let's hope so - again, it will be what makes it useful to the mainstream, not speculators buying something they don't understand to make a quick buck.

Fair point. Shame the advert's for something as mundane as a BMW. I'm pretty sure Arthur C. Clarke had something cooler in mind than that. I also disagree that the future's going to be uniformly fantastic, since it's fairly clear that large swathes of it are going to suck quite badly for a lot of people.
But yes, it will be interesting to see where cryptocurrency does take us.

The temptation to flame is so strong, but instead I'm going to suggest you read more than the headlines. Deflate, not crash. Appreciate, not disappear. Apps to mainstream, not leave the preserve of the tech savvy.
It's called nuance, and it's quite important.

I agree it would be very different in character. I also think a company like Google has a lot to gain by trying it, and they would probably succeed in pulling a good few speculators (not hard-core fans) away. The network effect would probably stop them being too successful, but still - they'd be a powerful detractor and have the infrastructure and regulatory framework to get a headstart.

I'd agree, but... you don't give any evidence. I did, though, so I'm even less sure what you mean.
