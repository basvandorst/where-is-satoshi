I want this product so bad, I never need normal banks anymore when I have this card.

You dont have to buy the card, they are free.
You have to lock up some of their tokens for 6 months to get a platinum card with the cashback, its its free and probably will make you a lot of money in the process.
You are very misinformed man. They are so cheap because they are a direct visa partner. Please stop lying.

@_date: 2018-01-30 15:50:42
Not sure why you are commenting on me because you show the median transaction value, which is something very different and your chart only shows how perfectly designed bitcoin is. 
As long as your chart stays relatively stable, the price is in line with the adoption rate.

Bitcoin is the most decentralized, most secure, value ecosystem which we have ever invented. 
It replaces banks and currency.
If you want to talk in valuation, think at adding the total value of all banks in the world plus the value of the money producing industry together. 
Our current system,accounting and banks, are expensive because we dont trust each other, hence we need a lot of people to check up on each other. The cashier needs to be checked by a department-head, the department-head gets checked the  the cfo, the cfo gets checked by and accountant, the accountant gets checked by the government, the government gets checked by the central bank etc. 
Same goes for banks, there are a lot of people working in banks because we dont trust each other, abd a lot of financial instruments are build around a 3rd party who acts like a middleman and that is where the banks make their money. 
Then there is value in bitcoin as a ecosystem for investment. Alts are traded in bitcoin. There is value in bitcoin as a storage of wealth, its very cheap in doing that, nothing competes. There is value in bitcoin as a p2p cashsystem in the future when exchanges mature or when lighting will be operational. I can go on but I think you get the idea. 
Bitcoin replaces 75% of all these costs for society. If you talk about valuation of bitcoin in terms how you value Tesla, you should get a bigger calculator.

No one has cards right now, but mco has the long term vision. Instead of pushing out useless cards they went trough all the regulation and compliance not to get into this position, one of the benefits for us users is that their fees will be way lower so the card is actually usable for every day use.

No, I dont think it will work like that. 
I will make you prediction, If I am wrong I will pay you 50 dollar in whatever currency you want in 12 months time. Use the reminder bot or something. 
Within 12 months from now I can pay in a similar taxi like that in Japan with a "layer 2" solution with a fee lower than 0,10 dollar cent. My layer 1 will be bitcoin. 
I dont know how it will work exactly, but I know that this will be the result for me as a consumer.

there is: The more decentralized the better.


In security, its about finding the weakest link. In your example its better to have 100 nodes on random pc's, owned by 100 people, because attacking all 100 of them would be way more effort than attacking the 100 nodes in 5 datacenters owned by 1 company. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:45:28
No, it has no direct influence on the price, it will just spread the story of bitcoin to more mainstream people and make further regulation easier.

I looked at your post history and you only comment negative things. They are pretty fud-ish as in a lot of emotional statements without any good arguments why you think as negative like you do.  
Its doesn't add any value to anyone and most you hurt yourself with negative toxic comments. You are what you think and if you write negative things, you will become a negative human. In some things you are right: fees are high now. But you forget all the other beautiful aspects of bitcoin. Being extreme is never good, try to think a bit more moderate, you will see that you will feel better about yourself and life.

I dont want to pay my taxi with bitcoin. I want to pay my taxi with a less expensive, less secure layer 2 solution. That could be lightning (lets first see how it functions in real life), that could be bitcoin cash (its less expensive and less secure than bitcoin) or that could be another altcoin or solution.
The point is, security costs money, I want high security for my main stash, I want low security (because cheaper) for my payment layer.
I think we are already there, where exchanges and altcoins function together as a cheap layer 2. If I want to buy something on steam, I use litecoin, If I want to send a tip to someone here on reddit or make small p2p cashpayments, I can use bitcoin cash. If I want to hide some money, I use Monero. If I want to buy something in a store, I use Monaco or Tenx. The future is already here, its beautiful. Bitcoin and the whole ecosystem including bitcoin cash make it possible.

You are a very critical person.
No, we are discussing economics, its basic economics really. There is a need for the solution. There are a few ways how we can achieve that. 1. lightning. 2. maturing of exchanges 3. consumer focussed solutions like  And probably a few other solutions I havent thought of yet.

Because the governments stays in place and can continue their expensive hobbies (war, terrorizing their own country, control media etc) and have to create real value in their economy to stay in power, its hard to stay a dictator if you cant pay your solders to suppress the people.
Going to a bitcoin driven economy would reward good behavior and punish bad behavior, it would take away power with centralized institutes like governments and would empower the individual.

Lets not judge or patronize others for their individual motivation to get into crypto. We all started out like that, its part of the individual journey we all make.
Help them not falling for scams, educate them on decentralization and motivate them to learn more.
Bitcoin enables the individual to apply his or hers own use case without any interference of a 3rd party. Everyone has their own role to play, hodling, trading, developing etc. Even the butters have a functional role in our community by pointing out flaws. We need newbies who get overwhelmed with passion for crypto in order to produce new devs, hodlers, traders etc. Its all good. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 20:47:30
its a free market, everything is allowed and things will balance out in the long run.
@_date: 2019-03-13 20:37:37
without bitcoin, there is no blockchain. Bitcoin has value because of its scale and history. We have all the other coins to experiment how we can get more value out of the tech, but bitcoin is not competing in this race. Its now competing in its own race against fiat and other investments, hence why we even talk about SEC and ETF nowadays. Its inevitable as long as bitcoin keeps working.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:03:45
because they are not open ledgers with a limited amount and they are not decentralized.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:09:34
Bitcoin is too big. They simply cannot buy every bitcoin, price will move up or down with the demand of the manipulation.
What is the narrative you are afraid of? That they buy all bitcoin? impossible. That they manipulate the price down to 1 dollar? I wont happen, there are millions of people who are interested in bitcoin now and everybody has their own price to buy. It can go down, but it will go up again. Bitcoin has too much utility as a decentralized valuessytem to go to 0.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:28:46
This links to nothing?
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:22:37
There is much more utility than only long term hodl. 
With value system, I don't mean the store of value, but the only decentralized system we have on this earth to exchanging value without 3rd parties involved.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:40:14
Taking out 365,000 bitcoin out of circulation per year would be very noticeable by the market. This means that in the 10 years they do it, they will inflate the price with their actions. No matter how they buy it or in which proportions. 
What you are describing is a big group of people, dollar-costing-average in bitcoin and then selling all at once when price is way higher. Good strategy :D This happened after the bullrun in 2017, where many individuals combined together acted like your group of bad actors. 
There was a huge amount of dumping by people who made a huge amount of money by hodling bitcoin for years. Its healthy for the market, because the lower bitcoin price will drive in new individuals in the system to replace the old holders. 
Bitcoin would not care at all, and your group of bad actors can only manipulate bitcoin till they sold all their bitcoins. And just by participating in the system and buying 10% with their trillions, they create a huge amount of utility value for bitcoin itself.
In your example you think they can manipulate the price forever, they cant. They run out of fiat or bitcoin at some point and the market will catch up in the long run.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:46:58
Because bitcoin does not want to prevent that.
In other systems (gold, stocks etc) there is a difference in power between the players, big banks play by different rules than you and me, they have more power.
If everybody can manipulate the market, no one can. In bitcoin, the rules are equal for everyone, no matter if you are a big bank, a homeless person or the queen. Equal power. What you are describing is not manipulation, its how markets work. A big fish tries to eat a smaller fish, till it gets eaten by an even bigger fish. The total market acts as a very big fish who eats every other fish long term.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:58:31
bitcoin does not care about the price. Only humans do. 
If all the "bad bankers' would conspire together they can bring the price down temporary, but at some point, they want to take profit and reverse their trade will bring buying pressure and cancel out their manipulation. 
In reality, it will never happen, small groups will try to influence price, but won't succeed because the market is too big now and there are a limited amount of bitcoin. Bitcoin does not need regulation, the lack of it makes sure that it gets tested every day by bad actors and all of them failed in the last 10 years.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:20:15
No, you are saying that.
I am saying that by Bitcoins decentralized and limited nature, it is resistant to long term manipulation. Why? Because it happens since the start, what you are thinking is nothing new, many people tried, some made money, some lost, but bitcoin is still here doing its thing.
Humans can manipulate each other, and we already have regulation for that, a justice system. The stockmarket needs it because it's not an open ledger, so people with more power than others can manipulate it. There is trust involved. Trust needs regulation.
Bitcoin is trustless.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:08:05
read my friend. Its good for bitcoin with a reason. Simple fundamentals, if money will flow out of thether, most of it will go back to bitcoin. Dont make fun of what I say because the conclusion is that its good for btc, that is kind of shitty. Some things are fundamentally good for BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:16:35
Think about how tether works, its very simple:
They create a token, sell it for bitcoin and sell the bitcoin for USD to back their token. The same bitcoin get sold twice, once for usdt and once for usd.
Its not more complicated than that. In a bullmarket this does not matter so much, but in a bearmarket it accelerates the downward price.
Tether is worth 2.2 billion right now, that is 2.2 billion sold bitcoin in the last months. 2.2 billion downloard pressure in the last months on the price, if this 2.2 billion will flow back to bitcoin, its a good thing.
Its good for bitcoin if tether cannot hold their 1 on 1 peg with the usd, simply because money will flow back to bitcoin, it can even mean the end of the bearmarket because of the fundamentals.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:27:16


Ok, go out and buy 10% of all bitcoin out there. That amount of pressure in the market will boost the price so high that you run out of money before you have your 10%.
And then what? You want to crash the price to 1 dollar by market selling your 10%? Ok, enough people to buy it from you.
I will make a big statement here: No one can get 10% of all bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2018-10-21 12:37:30
You are right in how you feel it, its part of growing. You feel the same as 100-years-ago-you about the local newspaper.
If twitter will continue their policy, they will become less relevant and a more decentralized option will take its place in the market. 
These things come in waves, revolutions. I agree with you that we are not on top of our current wave, but its so much better than all the waves before us, and later waves will be even more better. 
Dont worry too much about the big waves, acknowledge them and just go with the flow.
@_date: 2018-10-21 12:03:46
I did read it all. Your scenario is entertaining, but highly unlikely to end out like you wrote. The beginning is possible, its how the first world war started so it has the ingredients for a global war or recession. 
The difference between 1914 and now is that governments control relatively less power and people have relatively more power. And in your story, you assume some stupid, emotional decisions, from multiple very centralized powers, without the people stopping them.
We have the internet, we have bitcoin. Exactly those two things will stop this from happening. The rest of the wold will unite after the first nuclear incident and stop it from escalating. Humanity as a whole is not so dumb anymore. We as a total entity became smarter when communication and access to information became accessible for everyone with the internet. This changes decision making in a scenario like yours.
The internet gave us access to information and global communication, look how much more knowledge you and I have than people like us 100 years ago. 
The only reason why (bad) governments still control people is because the governments control money. Bitcoin can and will change that, its inevitable.
We, humans, wont allow a scenario like yours to happen anymore, we wont let our governments take away the internet like we know it anymore, they cant. In a scenario like yours, the internet and bitcoin will just get stronger, because these are the tools, we as people have to stop governments from doing extremely stupid shit. 
Its out of the box now, the process of decentralization in government, economy and power already begun a long time ago. Nothing can stop it, nuclear war can slow it down temporarily, but every bad event from now on, will just us more aware of the fact that we need a decentralized, global currency.
If anything: Nuclear war, or any bad event which wont kill most of humanity, is good for bitcoin long term. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 12:21:32
The difference with events like you name and events 100 year ago is that you and a I can discuss them. We each do our individual thinking and share our knowledge on places like this. 
Every event from now on will be watched and judged by more people, and this will lead till better descionmaking in general. 
You only know that Saddam did not had nuclear weapons because the US cant control all the information around the event. Same with the doubts about 911. You can find first person perspective videos from every side in the Syrian war on the internet, almost every event from now on will have content from almost every party involved. 
You only feel its worse because you see more content about bad events, but you and I just get more educated about the world around us. Its pretty neat.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:17:34
This is good for BTC, remember how tether works:
They invent tether out of nothing, buy btc with it and sell the btc on other markets for real usd to back it up.
Thether was directly responsible for the bear market becasue it would bring the price down twice: once when people sell for Tether, and again when Bitfinex sell the same bitcoin for USD.
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:00:14
The only reason why people get hacked is user-error, its never the tech of bitcoin itself.
You sound a bit like you think its a problem in the tech, its not, its just in people who are not careful. Same thing applies to not being careful with fiat money.


How did you come to this conclusion? There is no ground for a conclusion like this.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:57:00
You see things man, its almost like you want it to be a fraud.
The risk here was that Tether would create tokens without having the fiat for it. Now we know that is not true. 
It very logical why they are careful with giving information. They dont have to, there is no legalization yet. 


This is where you lose the touch with reality. You make up things because tether having fiat does probably not fit your narrative. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:12:38
Cool that you openly admit your mistake, because of that, I bookmarked your website and will use it instead of CMC.
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:30:57
because there is no way to audit crypto. 
Best thing they can do is check which bank accounts Tether uses and contact those banks to see if the funds are really there. Add it all up and compare it with the total value of the tokens created.
And I think that is what they did.
Its also what you want them to do. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:44:17
That is typical in these documents, they have to trust 
3rd parties like banks to be honest about the information they provide.


FSS	is	confident	that	Tether’s	unencumbered	assets	exceed	the	balance	of	 fully-backed	USD	Tethers	in	
circulation	as	of	June	1st, 2018.
This is the important part.
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:20:46
"Typical" was referring to the Law firms putting in the disclaimer in the document, its typical for a situation where they have to trust 3rd parties.
I understand what you want to see, but I think you ask for too much. It would be bad for security if they give out too much details how they handle and move the money around. For me its very binary thing: If they can show they have the billions at the moment the lawfirm checked, 99% of my concern is gone. Its not something you come up with in a day and if they control so much money, its not worth for them to ruin the business.

Bitcoin can't be replicated and you have to get your hands dirty and educate yourself with time and resources to get it.
You seem to think that altcoins are the same as bitcoin, its not. There is nothing on this earth with compares to bitcoin. Its the most decentralized network we as mankind, ever built. Its so far ahead that nothing compares to it. Altcoins are just altcoins, good for trading, but they are nothing compares to bitcoin in terms of scale. Bitcoin works so well becasue its designed around human greed, there will always be miners to keep the network running, there will always be hodlers and traders, there will always be people who want bitcoin for their usecase. As long as the network keeps working, it will just keep growing. 
Every actor in bitcoin, acts out of greed and egocentric reasons, you, me, the miners, exchanges, hodlers, traders, devs, all of us, this is why bitcoin will continue growing as long as it keeps working.
I think there is a good chance that the libra will function as a second layer on bitcoin, its perfect for that. Less secure, less decentralized, but more stable and cheaper to transact. The libra will probably become the dominant pair to trade bitcoin with soon after its launch.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:17:41
Dont buy everything now. If you plan to be in it for years, it wont matter if you bought at 11k, 13k or 9k.
The first weeks you will buy in you will undergo a rollercoaster of emotions and a urge to educate yourself about bitcoin. 24/7. We all go trough it. You want these first weeks to be either stable or going up. Bitcoin is quite oversold now and maybe will rise directly to moon but there is a risk on a big correction before that. I
Buy 250 dollar every week for the next few weeks, or months. It will be better for your experience.

I am not trying to troll you, you seem to be inteligent and have and have an understanding of economics. But you still dont understand what decentralized means. Bitcoin is too big already. Even if half the world would ban bitcoin, the network will continue and provide tools for individual usecases at the other half of the world.

@_date: 2019-06-23 21:17:31
You are not qualifying the number of transactions, but it wont work, it means that there wont be any satoshi to pay miners to do your transactions. 
In the case the fees are included in your example, all transactions will just go trough, it will take a while though.

Facebooks coin is not a competitor for bitcoin, its a stablecoin and just another fiat ramp to bitcoin in some way. It will make people more comfortable with the idea of digital money and thus more educated why bitcoin is good.
Bitcoin is good because its decentralized, Facebooks coin is everything but that. Centralization is not a meme, its real. The users of FB's coin will run into the downsides of centralized digital money.
Do you even understand what bitcoin is?
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:40:43
credible source pls, because you make big statements without backing them up.
Its near impossible to identify the location of hashpower so I am curious how you became so knowledgeable. My guess right now is that you dont have credible sources for you statements, you just read this stuff on a random crypto blog written by a person who also just make random statements. 
Take a step back and try to understand how mining works, how mining pools function and why miners would not destroy their own investment because they end up even more broke than all us hodlers.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:24:50
You are the only one being stupid making stupid claims which you cannot back up. 
Yes China is important for mining, no China does not own 2/3 of hashpower, what your original (stupid) claim was. 
No one knows the exact location of miningpower, but If I use the same logic as your source: Occams Razor, it means that the relative mining power in China went down the last 2 years. 
Why? One of the reasons is that it is illegal to sell bitcoin in China, so it will be harder to make a legit business around mining nowadays, than a few years ago. Plus I think only 1 or 2 of the biggest mining farms are in China, the rest in countries like North America and Europe.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:05:33

@_date: 2019-12-08 23:19:53
Probably because of a lot of reasons but an important one could be:
Venezuela is not tech-savvy as a society yet, bitcoin would be a better alternative if internet and tech is more commonly used. If for example, the people in Hong Kong don't want to use the currency of their government anymore, bitcoin would be a better alternative.
@_date: 2019-12-25 16:12:27
If you read the report they use as a source  you will see that its a guess, and they they have nothing to back it up:


newly deployed hardware has been predominantly
installed in China
So what is their reasoning? 


this, but Occam’s Razor suggests that it is likely an
effect of relational and geographic proximity to
manufacturers making barriers to business comparatively lower. We also understand that it is not
uncommon for large Chinese miners to have ‘VIP’
accounts at the large hardware manufacturers and
thereby getting preferential access to the first
batches of new gear – although we cannot document
this with written proof. 
its a complete bullshit report without facts written to support some narrative and shilled by coindesk for views.
You are doing the same: You create a narrative that you want to shill 51% here on reddit, look at your account history and you use guesses as facts. Stop spreading false information and try to understand why what you are saying is bullshit.
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:23:59
I dont think 2/3 of the hashpower is under the chinese goverment. 
Yes, a lot of hashpower in located in China, but its not 2/3rd. Chinese goverment does not control this hashpower and whoever controls it, will not use it for a 51% attack, becuase they make money now with this hashpower, but they wont anymore when they use it for an attack. They will hurt themselfes the most by attacking what they invested in. This is why bitcoin is so great, its designed arround the human greed and being a good actor pays more than being a bad actor.
pls give me a creditable source that 2/3 of the hashpower is controlled by the Chinese goverment, because you dont have it.

You need prove to see how BCH is centralized around bitcoin and bitmain?
I am a bit suprised that you dont see it but ok:
You dont see how Bitmain and Ver a major holders of the coin and they abuse their power over the ecosystem to push it. They are connected to many companies and most of the companies supporting BCH have a link to Roger as an investor.
The moment Roger will drop his support for BCH because of ego, and this will happen somewhere in the future, BCH will lose almost all its value because bitcoin.com is the main force behind pushing the coin. Because its centralized. Or the moment where bitmain needs to sell their bags, the value of the coin will vanish. They were the biggest buyer in the past when they demanded people to buy miners with BCH only.  You really dont see this or are you not aware what I mean with centralized?
BCH has centralized power, centralized holders, centralized marketing and any big pool of bitcoin miners can do a 51% attack on BCH whenever they feel like. There is no real security in BCH as long as they use the same miners as BTC. It has only 5% hashpower of BTC. Its a huge risk.
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:32:29
because outside bitcoin, all the other coins are centralized. BCH is a good example of it, its more a centralized business token of bitcoin.com and bitmain. 
And I am not even talking about security here, just look at the difference in hashpower. BCH is an inferior product with no real use case. Its not suitable for retail like they intended.

its a very specific mining pool at one end of the spectrum though. People who mine trough bitcoin.com do that probably mostly because they support the activism behind the pool. Most pools are more neutral because the pool is not profiling itself.

Their value is way bigger than just a metal creditcard.
The app has a lot of value, you can use your btc and mco to buy on credit witout selling your coins, that is unique to the space. You can link you bankaccount to use fiat with the card or buy and sell crytpo on the fly. You get cashback in crypto if you spend money with the card. Besides that the metal cards have VISA platinum with all perks.
Its an exchange, creditcard and wallet in one. It will as easy to buy and sell as coinbase, but you can also spend it direcly with the card.
Its everything I wanted to actually use crypto in the real world.

He is a crooked seller. If he was a good seller he would have sold trough an auction, like he was advised and what the standard strategy is in these cases. 
He didnt do that, he sold on the market, why would he do that?
**Option 1:** He had no strategy and panicked when the price went down and wanted to secure the funds to pay back the claimed fiat. This would show incompetence, he was very much the reason the price went down. 
This is a guy with a good financial background, its hard for me to imagine he is a complete moron in managing funds, he got the job because people though he was competent.
**Option 2:** This guy sees the chance to make some sweet money, he informs his friends when he is making the sales and they short the market with leverage. He gets his cut in XMR and is probably celebrating with coke and hookers as we speak. 
It is this guy, look at his background. Does he look like a financial moron to you or like a some who is smart enough to figure out he will be set for life if he plays this right?

No, we should not stop. But the system is too complicated that it hurts all the good actors from benefiting more of the system.


This is why I am advocating for bitcoin, let me explain:
The system is expensive and powerful now because we dont trust each other. When you pay something in a shop, the cassier will get checked by the manager by the end of the day if all the cash is there. He will get checked by the regional manager or cfo, they will get checked by an accountant, those will get checked by some financial laywer and those will get checked by a bank. In the bank there are 7 more layers of people checking each-other, each time the pay check of this person increases because they hold more power over our system. 
Bitcoin is trustless, you dont need to have all these people checking eachother, and you remove the powersystem. All this money and energy can go into better things, like service. If my bank didnt fire my personal contact-person 8 years ago, they would know who I am, what my business is, and could make such a better judgement of my creditworthy or if I behave like a criminal. People are just better in these things than computers. And computers are better in checking numbers. Its silly that our system is the other way around.
Maybe you have a different personal experience, due to your localisation or just sheer luck. Bravo for that. but that doesn't make my personal experience less valid. I am not acting like a 15 year old kid, you are twisting my words and assuming things becasue you think in extremes. I dont want to bring the system down, and bad guys are bad. dont worry.
I have a need for blockchain based economy, where I can create more value for society with the same energy. And where the power is equally divided. There are many like me, just not everyone is aware yet but it will come. I am sharing my experience to educate others.
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:54:08
its too late. they dont have the power anymore to do that. Parts will be censored and manipulated, but no one can stop the entire internet anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:39:10
Now you just sound like a little child.
Be real man, we need these type of products to make real world use cases. Crypto wont take over the whole system overnight. 
This will be a card focused on mainstream adaption, a lot of normies will look into products like this becasue its the path of the least resistance, especially with banks fighting back lately, we need people in the Fintech space who build bridges.

I disagree. Its like the war on drugs, its a pointless system which controls the good actors with the excuse that there are a few bad actors. 
The effort to catch criminals should be when or just before they commit the crime, not when they are interacting with the legal system, that means they got away with the crime. Invest all the salaries of those useless bankers into police on the street, into educating and building society. 
I understand your point, but you are repeating what the system taught you.

The US acknowledging that crypto is a real thing is what I always dreamed about. 
Regulation and the licencing will open up so many real use cases for crypto related business and crypto in general and it will allow us investors to buy btc easier and safer. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:51:42


I am not in it for the anonymity and I told you the answer already:
By having a blockchain based economy, we dont need to check eachother anymore and invest this value into interaction between people. Banks will compete on customer service because they hold no power anymore and financial institutions in general cannot do bad things anymore because of individual greed of the people who run them. This will balance the power between the ecosystem, and its users and thus being an open market like many others.
I know this is a simplified way of putting it, but this is in general what will happen with financing in the next decade or so. Why? Because there is money to be made in this new ecosystem, and we have a need for a decentralized international value system in our current stage of development.

Your fees are high because of the USD/PHP part, not because of the bank self so much, or because of bitcoin.  
In both use cases you cant really get around this or you have to trade your bitcoin for cash locally on localbitcoins, in that case you even out the fees to a few sat total.
In the end of the day its forex-fees vs bitcoin price fluctuations for your usecase.

Jamie Dimon very much represents the other side of our economy, the old part, the centralization, the debt etc. Of course he will say that there wont be a recession any time soon, he will be blind for all the signs and wont realize its there when it hits him, he is part of it.
In that sense bitcoin is a hedge against the system, mostly because the next recession will be because the old system is not ready for global trading and the people who represent the old system will think in short term gain for them self. 
Trump, Jamie Dimon etc. will just hurt the global economy to grow because they are overly protective about the US system. This will continue to work till it wont. It can be tomorrow, it can be in 5 years, but it will happen eventually. 
The US is heading for a bear-market, no matter how you look at it, fundamentally or technical. The global market however, is doing fine, so many new economies developing. They just need a global ecosystem so they can trade value for goods and services around the world do the fall of the US wont drag them down. They will realize this when the next recession will hit, and in that sense, bitcoin is a safe haven when the economy tanks. It will tank because our current system is unsustainable and we as humanity have a need for a decentralized, global ecosystem to exchange value.

Under spotprice was more a thing of the past when it was harder to convert bitcoin back to cash. If you want to cash out a large amount of bitcoin now you can easily spread it over exchanges and get the spot for your bitcoin.

They are very focused on meeting local compliance rules,  so they will launch the products per market. Asia comes first, expected in the next weeks. Europe is Q2, US Q3.
They took a different approach than most cryptocards, the CEO even predicted 6 months ago that the other cards would get banned because they dont have the compliance on par.

Dont worry, there are numerous factors why this happens.
* We as the community learned how to use btc responsible since the high fees. Most people learned to check what the best fee is before they send a transaction and they learned to do less random transactions between their own wallets.
* Exchanges adopted batching and use segwit, this is a huge factor since the primary use-case for btc is investing in crypto and most traffic is from and to exchanges.
* Most traffic is already offchain, most transactions happen on exchanges.
* BTC lost its usecase as p2p money and people use altcoins like bch or ltc for this. 
* last but not least: The average transaction value is way higher now, look at 
This supports most of my claims that btc is getting used as an investment ecosystem more than p2p money atm. Lightning will open the p2p usecare and retail usecase again. The next usecase for btc will be real estate I guess since the usecases change with the increasing price, and increasing security.
Dont worry too much about this, look at the real facts: The world acknowledges bitcoin now and thousands of people are working on development every day to make new niche usecases to use btc. We as a community educated ourselves in the last 6 months and we changed our behavior accordingly. Its good for the long term, its the natural way and how btc is designed to work.

Monaco is expecting to become a Visa program manager soon. This means they will be cheaper/better than cards who will use a 3rd party. They took the long road and want to play by the rules of the current financial system to make it easier for normal consumers. Research showed me that they have the best plan by far among the crypto cards. 
They offer 0,75% cashback, no atm fee's and some other pretty good conditions, check them out. 
Roll out of the cards is planned for October, starting with Asia, Europe in Q4, next year NA. Atm already 15000 preorders. Check them out.

I really believed two weeks ago that the card would be launched by now, but its also not the first time I thought that. 
They are bad with deadlines, or good in hinting, they dont give hard deadlines. but I think its also because of the changes in the space lately and the product seem to get better and better.
Its like having a relationship with a unstable but super hot girl: so much drama but very much worth it at the end of the day.

Bitcoin has by far the biggest ecosystem, the most individual devs, the most hashpower and most social control, thus the most secure.  By far the most individual holders, -miners, -exchanges, places to spend it etc, the most different people involved, thus the most decentralized.  
Nothing compares to bitcoin in terms of scale, nothing grew organic like bitcoin. Decentralization and security is what makes crypto crypto, if something ever overtakes bitcoin it has to be many times better in these two things.

The way we, as the community as a whole, handle our transactions, is very different than last year.
Exchanges batch now, together with segwit, that is an immense difference. It was one of the reasons why the network congested last year. 
Also, we as users are more educated how to use the network now. Most of us understand how to handle our transactions feewise, and most wallets adapted to a more healthy algorithm for automatic fees. 
In general the network can handle more transactions now, the ecosystem handles fees in a more healthy way and the users are more careful with clogging the network.
And in the background we have lightning in development for micropayments. 
Bitcoin is in a better situation now, prepared for more traffic. Still not the scale for mass adoption yet, but you dont have to worry for 10 dollar fees any time soon.

Failed in decentralization and consensus.
Both are controlled by a central, commercial entity: Bitcoin.com and nChain. 
And now its proven that once you start forking, it will never stop. Its a group of extremists who had success with pushing their opinion by forking in the past. Every change will find some resistance and instead of reaching consensus, forking is an option now for that group and some will continue to do it. BSV is proof. With every fork, the community/development/security will split till they are no longer relevant.
The chain that forked from BTC will continue to fork till death, its inevitable because of human nature.

They will be 100x what they are today, in fiat, because the value of bitcoin will also way higher. We will have a well functioning layer 2 to process &gt;99% of the transactions. So it will work fine, miners get paid a little bit of bitcoin in transaction fees, but it will be a high fiat price to motivate them to mine. Most on chain transactions will be high value transactions, we will have a cheap layer two for everything else. 
Why will this happen you ask?
If bitcoin is still around when the block-rewards end, it will have a lot of utility for mankind, it will be unique given its history, which means that people will continue to build on it, simply because there is money to make for the individual. 
Its the beauty of bitcoin: It empowers the individual to act in his or her own interest instead of the group-interest. And becasue of all the individuals, it will have value for the group as a whole. All of us, holdlers, traders, devs, miners etc, we are all here for our self in the first place. 
You seem to look at it like the rewards will stop today, but keep in mind that there will be a 130 year blockchain by then. 
If bitcoin still works in 2140, it will be the most valuable thing mankind has ever build.
