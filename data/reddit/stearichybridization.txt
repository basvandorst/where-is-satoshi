So, we are going back to $75. Wouldn't look too devastating on your silly chart. Log charts are meaningless and tell you nothing. It's the same with the parabolic charts because they imply BTC at a few trillion in the not too distant future. Get real.

I suggest you watch some videos of Tom Lee who is lead research analyst at Fundstrat on Youtube. When being interviewed he mentions different approaches which Fundstrat uses to estimate Bitcoin prices. He often talks about the mining operational costs and recently he mentioned \*fair price\* based on wallet number. I don't know if their exact calculations are accessible for free though.
