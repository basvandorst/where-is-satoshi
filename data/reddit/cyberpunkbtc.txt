A lot more, but service providers are much more likely to implement payments in LN than standard ones. In addition, almost zero costs compared to payment cards and paypal are a very strong asset. LN is currently an early beta but the developers are very fast. LN will actually show its strengths only with a really big BTC adoption. This does not make a huge difference on a small scale ...

Certainly not. It's a fuddle that has been duplicated for a very long time.  As for porn, two quite large websites accept payments in LN.

 Of course, please use wherever you want. 
Recently, the network has become so large that Internet visualizers stop working. r/ That's why I made this render in HQ. Later, you will need to use the software to visualize the network and import to them lists of nodes and channels because the web probably can not be helped anymore.

The revolution is coming. Low LN costs will destroy the thieving banking system, which steals the commission at any time of the money transfer!

Because for them, the oligarchs are bought with bitcoins and because of their own interest have completely eliminated the tax for several years with the crypto! They look at each other and Bitcoin is in their interest: D

 How much energy do air conditioners consume, because even in the heat of the day bankers do not take off their jackets to look good?
All TV in the world switched off on standbay consume more energy than BTC.
Bitcoin is being attacked because it's easy to just consume it with just a few clicks, like nothing else in the world.
