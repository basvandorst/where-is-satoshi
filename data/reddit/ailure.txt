Two puzzling things my bank wants that is probably not a too big deal to ask about but I'm curious if anyone ran into it themselves. I was able to provide everything else they asked about (or well, I prepared documentation of the rest rather hadn't submitted it yet).
1. They want a confirmation that it's me who been in the control of the cryptocurrency account/wallet. I created a specific signed message of all the addresses I ever used in the said wallet, but I'm worrying this might be too complex. Then again they seemed to have a set procedure for how to handle cryptocurrency trades. A proof of ownership of the Coinbase/GDAX account would be nice and I asked the support for this but they're not exactly blazingly fast.
2. They also want information/proof on when the cryptocurrency account/wallet was created. Also asked the Coinbase support about this on the end due to how unclear the bank was if it was just not about my personal wallet.
Really not sure if it's just the personal wallet I been in control of they're talking about (I use Electrum now but some of the old private keys I used was first created on Multibit) or the one on Coinbase/GDAX (or the ones on the various exchanges I bought on in the past). And yeah I sold BTC on GDAX.

Yeah his opinion at the time seemed that it was too early to get mainstream attention for Bitcoin. I think he considered his job done and also didn't want to gather any future heat on his head, a bit contrast to the current trend where cryptos has figureheads that dosen't even use a psudonym.

I gifted 0.1 BTC in paper wallets a couple of years back to two people when it was only worth 50-60 USD or so. It was a little awkward "ok wtf is this" moment, and probably a bit cringy in retroaspect, but they accepted and kept it.
They got really happy when I told them how much it was worth recently, turns out they kept it for all this time.
I would only suggest to do it to people who actually know and is comfortable with technology though.

While i personally don't think altcoin posts are a problem yet (anything good about a cryptocurrency, is generally indirectly good for bitcoin) , asking downvotes to do the main moderation never works. You just get the sub dominated by easily digested content and borderline circlejerkish but non-constructive content which drowns out the actual informative constructive content. Plus votes can easily be brigaded. Right now it's not a problem, but lack of moderation is what made subs like r/gaming and r/atheism so deplorable compared to subs like r/science or r/games which have stricter moderation and therefore more useful content. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:46:41
IIRC, historically trading on exchanges and transaction activity on the blockchain tend not be correlated. Especially due to a lot of traders keeping their BTC on exchanges like a bad habit so their activity never shows up on the blockchain at all (so it's a offchain trade).

A common mistake people do is to link to the whitepaper and assumes it's readable by everyone. It's very well written, and is easy to read but if you have no grasp of cryptography and basic computer science stuff it's probably unreadable. It does explain the way the blockchain and bitcoin works fairly well though!

Yes, infact it's a bad idea to receive all your incoming payments into one address unlike you want to be trackable on purpose (such as for a donation address). So a active bitcoin user can easily be the owner of 10-1000 addresses. On the contrast, there is probably people who buy BTC virtually on a exchange but never move it to a wallet of their own and therefore never touch the blockchain directly. I don't think the latter group is significantly large to matter though.

Probably worth to mention that it was occasionally abused for harassment. And no i'm not talking about r/buttcoin linking to r/bitcoin (as annoying it was, they would raise occasionally good points sometimes in the middle of the trolling) but as in actual serious harassment of sometimes of the sexist/racist kind. Plus it was kinda annoying in meta-subs like r/subredditdrama where people in the drama would follow the bot back to the meta sub (then again you can argue it would be a good thing that participants are aware of inter-linkage).
I'm surprised a similar bot hadn't been created yet to take it's place though, unless the reddit admins are strictly disallowing it now. No admins have talked about it's disappearance and it doesn't appear to be shadowbanned, so it's creator might just had put it offline.

Oh I'm well aware of that. Heck, I felt bad buying some at 15 when it dropped down to 10 USD for a bit. :P Now I really regret I didn't buy more (but admittly at the time I didn't expect those two crazy upswings in value).
@_date: 2014-05-05 08:18:42
I dunno. It tend to get very circlejerk esque when people rally about the price going up, and get very defensive and in denial when it's going down (hodl), mixed with possible bad financial advice when it's going in either direction (ironically a possible good sign it's time to sell is when people start posting hold memes :P). A balance is preferable, with the least elitism as possible. Ironically most of the elitistic people rarely have any idea what they're talking about anyway (Dunning–Kruger effect in action). We need to cull out the truly stupid content (low-effort), without necessarily scaring away the newbies by being a elitist (answering questions properly rather than telling them to read the whitepaper).
The trolls feed on the negative aspects of the community, the drama and all. If we can cull those negative aspects of the community, we also cull the trolls.
As much as I'd like the easygoing approach of r/dogecoin, I'd like to see r/bitcoin ban any low-effort posts such as memes and put those into a separate sub. It's really funny seeing people try to portray bitcoin as serious when memes are regularly posted and upvoted here. Unfortunately this probably would never happen. Pray we never hit r/atheism level of bad moderation (it got a bit better when they managed to kick out the lead mod).

I'd probably purchase more often with BTC if it wasn't such a pain in the ass to obtain. Ok, I do use kraken and I do get my BTC within a day or two... but buying BTC is not something I do compulsively.
I kinda wish for bitcoin ATMs to be more common so I can do more compulsive purchases with BTC.

As far I interpret capital gains related taxes, as long you wrote down how much the bitcoins you bought costed, it should be all fine in the future and you don't really have to worry about it until you start using/selling them in the future (tax laws might have changed by then anyway).

["Since Bitcoin is both a currency and a protocol, capitalization can be confusing. Accepted practice is to use Bitcoin (singular with an upper case letter B) to label the protocol, software, and community, and bitcoins (with a lower case b) to label units of the currency. "](
Other than the weird plural rule (I will keep calling it bitcoins in Swedish when going plural), it's seems pretty similar enough to the "proper way", seeing how they're talking about when it's used as a currency.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:18:33
Actually I meant it in a halfly jokingly manner at the time. If you consider bitcoin to be money, you don't technically really lose any money (bitcoins) and the right term would be instead "losing purchasing power" (as it drops in value compared to other currencies). Didn't mean for people to over-analyze those quotation marks. :P
I'm in it for the tech, so I don't really hate SEK, USD, EUR etc just that I think it's really cool to send something worth of value wholly digitally and decentralized as is with the case of bitcoin.

Seemed to be like a bitcoin wallet, payment system (paying by bitcoin like you pay with credit/debit cards), and a way of buying bitcoin ala coinbase.

Bought quite a bit a year ago for longterm, I'm not disappointed nor sweating about recent events (tbh bitcoin probably rose too fast in value anyway) since I still think in terms of in how much I originally invested.
The other main investment I have is various mutual funds, who is much less volatile than bitcoin but had very disappointing returns (despite supposing being a relatively "safe" investment). I think I earned more from traditional bank interest at this point. :/

Any wallet that doesn't require you to download the whole blockchain works. Though web wallets should be discouraged for larger amount of BTC (It's fine for a few dollars worth of BTC, or for as much as you might as a user deem convenient).

I taken apart the bitcoin protocol and... pretty much! The bigger challenge isn't on the dev side, but on the community side... getting people to adopt the changes done to the bitcoin protocol and doing so in a sane manner to prevent a blockchain fork. So far this hadn't been a problem though, as the last few times it had to be done (such as the great blockchain fork of 2013) it went fine.
Such a major change would certainly be announced months, if not a year in advance as if it's not done carefully it would cause another blockchain split. But the main bitcoin devs have handled it well so far, and the fact that the worst incidents of bitcoin protocol-wise hadn't killed it off is probably a good sign that even future exploits should be handled well. My bigger worry isn't the technology, but the possible regulations and even that part of the future looks bright for now.
It's generally why I discourage people to use satoshi as the denomination (the internal value and smallest value of bitcoin), cause it might change at some point in the (admittedly not nearby) future.

Back when Satoshi made that post, people were still CPU mining and the network was basically vulnerable to a 51% attack from anyone with enough money to throw computing power at it. It was back in the 10000 BTC pizza days after all.
Even if people argue that Bitcoin isn't widely adopted and have a market that fluctates widely, it's certainly is much more mature with the millions (billions?) dollars worth of mining equipment running right now. It's much harder to attack nowadays through various shady ways, and it's only getting harder as more powerful miners gets online.

I live in Sweden. Bought 200 USD worth of bitcoins last week (was about 0.52 BTC), was pretty much instant. Although worryingly it does go ahead with withdrawing money from your credit card and turn it into bitcoins without asking for confirmation. It does use 2FA for login and sending the actual bitcoins though (so worst case is that you have 500 USD spent on bitcoins if you leave a computer logged in on circle.com :P). I used a debit card.
Plus the advantage over a exchange is that you probably have better luck getting your money back through chargeback from circle.com if they do go belly up.

I find this interesting cause bitcoin got a fairly complicated script language as well, but it wasn't turing complete on purpose (no goto or loops related instructions) and a ton of instructions are disabled out of security concerns anyway. There is really isn't anything that would stop devs from making bitcoin turing complete itself other than the security concerns.

Just like the last halving, I got the feeling that the halving will have a psychological impact on the market. If the BTC to fiat value doubles around the same time of the halving, it wouldn't really make much of a difference to the miners short term. The psychological factor can make it a rather messy bubble like the past ones (going down 50% from ATH just like the two last times), but only time would tell. :)
Long term, it's difficulty that affects if mining is profitable or not. But that's assuming that mining keeps it's relative explosive growth, which might not necessarily be true two years from now (advancements slows down, less investments are made into mining, etc). Interestingly the mining difficulty is 100x times higher than a year ago.

They might, but dogecoin is quite centralized around r/dogecoin which bitcoin is at least spread out over more communities (bitcointalk in particular). Just pointing that out.

On a less alarming note though, if you are a more casual bitcoin user it's probably less likely you're using a bitcoin client that downloads the blockchain as whole (actually I wouldn't even consider suggesting bitcoin-qt to someone less computer literate), and therefore this might not be a issue for non-technical users.
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:31:55

So how can we be sure this is just not a way for the altcoin creator to get away with excessive premining? Keep in mind that it's probably not many who is going to take their claim of the currency so it would be shitty if the creator cashes out the unclaimed coins a few months after.

@_date: 2015-01-12 07:21:21
Trust Theymos or not, the worst thing he can do with the alert key is to send a bogus alert message (and be honest, most would doublecheck with the community if one was seen, the message isn't shown in most "light" clients IIRC anyway). Which can be overridden by the other key holders, and infact even invalidated with same protocol. In older bitcoin core versions it forced the client into safe mode, but that's no longer the case, probably cause concerns of abuse.
Though that would be the ultimate suicide in the community too.

That was the most attractive part for me with bitcoin, the very low transaction fees and possibility of using it as a cheap payment processor (infact I hope this "transaction cost" will go down as bitcoin get more popular with more exhanges).

Miner is not the same thing as a bitcoin node. Anyone can be a node in the bitcoin network, just run bitcoin-qt with the appropriate ports open. He's just talking about that not everyone need to run  a full node like with bitcoin-qt, in a indirect way he's more endorsing light clients like multibit for general users with that post.
What I find more interesting is the post he links to from that post, where he argues it's much harder for a double spend attack to be successful on a transaction involving a well connected node like that of what a company with it's own servers and therefore allow for fast payments for "snacks". And I'd probably agree with him it's safe enough for small transactions.

I gave out two paper wallets as a gift, and it worked out as I did offer trading it for fiat cash if they didn't want to bother. Both decided to keep it instead. No lecture about how amazing cryptocurrencies are, just basic security overview (don't reveal the private key to others), and a few namedrops of where they can spend it if they want to use it. So I think it's still a great gift if you keep a tact about it and don't evangelize, hell I used to be the biggest bitcoin skeptic for quite awhile myself and I think it's for the best to let people form their own opinion about it (although most of my family already have a general positive if somewhat careful outlook on BTC). Both of the gift receivers were fairly tech savy users as well FYI, I wouldn't give a paper wallet to my grandma.
Keeping a backup of their private keys just in case they lose the paper wallets, but I won't be sweeping any funds. Might just prod them about it if I see their balance unused after a while.

It's theoretically not impossible, transactions can be done offline or even calculated by hand and then be sent in a traditional manner through snail mail to someone with internet.
Needless to say though, none sane would be actually doing this. Especially when you consider the latency involved. And while I would like to see more people in poorer nations being able to use the Internet, bitcoin isn't exactly the first thing that comes to mind

Cheap, Safe, Fast.
Choose two.
It's unfortunate, as even as hyped I am for bitcoins from a transaction perspective (being able to move money around digitally!!!), it still really sucks to buy bitcoins. Which dosen't make it a very friendly currency for people new to it.
Admittedly just before posting this I had a very positive experience with bitstamp. Took only a day to transfer, and they let me know by e-mail when the money arrived, and have a lower fee than mtgox. But if you don't have a SEPA (European) bank account, it's probably not as smooth unfortunately.

South Park is actually a bad example as they tend to finish their episodes just a day before it's aired. Unlike Simpsons where it's done at least a year to half year in advance.

No problems! And thanks for the Internet! ;)

Last time this joke was posted, it was just moments before  the value fell.
