I can't believe people are trying to argue that in this thread. It's the exact same thing as if a store said they accept Euros, but when you went inside they said you have to exchange the euros for dollars at the place down the street first.

Why did it take 4 days? I haven't bought bitcoin since the fees are now $30, but one of my friends really wanted some just to say he had it, so he gave me cash to buy him a bit and I bought it and transferred it to his wallet in under 3 hours. and this was about a week and a half ago.

Haha nice, let's get right to the insults then.
I'm going to assume you didn't go to college, and probably barely graduated high school since you seem to not have a basic understanding of things.
Yes, engineers "design a building to collapse into it's own footprint." I'm not going to even bother to get academic links, because you're too dumb to understand them and you'll just blow them off as "blah blah illuminati." But if you want to, just google it, and stay away from any conspiracy websites. They're easy to find. 
I'm not an engineer today, but I thought I would be years ago. I took countless engineering classes. I've studied a lot on my own. And most importantly, I have common sense. 
By saying they're "designed to collapse into their footprint", we're not saying the engineers designed them to collapse. If you knew even the very first thing about engineering, which you clearly don't, you'd know that when you engineer something, you try to account for everything. It huge construction, civic engineering, you account to failure. If this building collapses, what will happen? If we design it this way, it will fall sideways like a tree and destroy a quarter of manhattan. If it falls into itself, it will only damage surrounding buildings. Let's design it collapse into itself in the untimely event of catastrophic failure. So they do, like with nearly every other high rise.
Of course controlled demolitions collapse that way, too. That's because once again, that's how they were designed to collapse. The demolition team just rigs explosives at the right points to make it collapse in the first place.
You're one of those truly idiotic people that barely graduated high school, yet think they know more than everyone else because they read a couple conspiracy websites. Go educate yourself before insulting people. You're so stupid, it's sad.

Even if literally every other part of your idiotic conspiracy is true, doesn't it make sense that high rises in new york would collapse into their footprint because they were fucking designed to collapse that way in the event of a collapse, because a building falling sideways in manhattan would be a million times worse?

I'm with you. I answered craftymuthafucka too, do you feel the same way I do?

Yeah that's really what it's seeming like.

If you can just deposit bitcoin and spend it, sure. But if you have to convert it to usd first, then you're not buying anything with bitcoin.

So... you're paying with dollars. That's like saying, "no you're not paying in bitcoin, you're paying in time you spent at work to earn dollars, which you then use to buy bitcoin, which you then use to buy this product. "
Or actually, it's more like a store that has an "Accepts Euros" sign on the window, but when you go inside they say, yeah we accept euros, but you need to go down the street to the currency exchanger to change the euros to dollars first. Then come back to the store and pay with the dollars. You're just paying in dollars.

I linked a site that lists articles that users submit that are all articles of people saying how bitcoin is dead. So far 160 articles have been submitted. I'm sure there are way more in existence.
