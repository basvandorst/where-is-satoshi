That 6k support is so strong, if it breaks so will my hopes

No, 6k level can range between $5700 and 6k as long as it bounces back quick from $5700 which it did.

Seems Bolivar currency should be for Bolivia. That could be the cause of this mess.

actually 3 years is the magic # after a crash. When we crashed from $1000 in 2014 it took 3 years to recover (2017 RUN), even in stocks, when amazon crashed 90&amp; it took 3 years, when apple crashed 70&amp; it took 3 years. It takes a long time for investors to gain back confidence. Currently most of the investors can't wait for it to go back to 7k so they can short the price and get some of their loses back then we're back down again. This cycle will repeat until a less anxious, less paranoid group of investors are willing to hold and increase the support lines. I GUARANTEE YOU 3 YEARS BEFORE WE SEE ANYTHING OVER 12K FOR BTC.

I think so as well. We stayed at 280 too long so the anxious investors dumped. Then at 270 too long and investors dumped again. Now we're staying at 240 too long so more anxious cats will dump

does it pull you up then cause you to crash?

craigslist or even ebay

It doesn't matter if the US Gov announces that they're going to make BTC the official currency of America. Investors have proven to be irrational and almost totally immune to good news.

all these projects are going to take attention away from cryptocurrency and shift the attention to blockchain tech with funding coming from more traditional investment systems.

it's the reason why the SEC is opening an investigation. They obviously have some evidence which made them take action.

It's been months

Institutional money is going in to blockchain tech. They're not going to log on Binance and buy BTC.

The idea of BTC is not a scam but it most certainly full of scum scammers or savages who will shill, fud, cheat, lie to make a buck. I would estimate that 70&amp; of crypto investors fall under this category. So until BTC/crypto go mainstream and attract institutional investors then yes it may very well be like a scam.
