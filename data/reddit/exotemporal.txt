What a piece of shit.
Major exchanges should have a lawyer in each country they do business in and go after people like your friend. It would be trivial to bring him down for fraud since he used his own bank account. Exchanges probably make enough money to absorb losses like these willingly, but it's frustrating that someone could get away with this.
I tried to reverse a transfer to Mt Gox as Mt Gox disappeared before the funds arrived and it was denied because the police wouldn't let me press charges. It looks like your friend just had to sign an affidavit. The exchange could at least try to get his bank to close his account or even press charges for lying on an affidavit.

The market cap doesn't reflect how much money is truly invested in bitcoin. It's a useful metric to compare multiple cryptocurrencies, but that's it. The vast majority of bitcoins weren't purchased at the most recent market price and there wouldn't be enough buyers to buy all of people's bitcoins at the most recent market price. If everyone decided to sell simultaneously, a few people would manage to sell their bitcoins for the most recent market price and then the price would crash and the market cap would melt with it. Similarly, you could spend 100 million dollars at once, which would increase the price dramatically and billions of dollar would be added to the market cap, but they'd be virtual dollars.

They're working on it as we speak and the site is slowly improving, but I got tired of waiting and only use Bitstamp now.
Bitstamp will send your bitcoins to your wallet for free. What's more, they cover the cost of the transaction fee, which is amazingly generous.
Kraken doesn't let you set up the fee and their default fee is quite high, so you lose a potentially sizable percentage of your capital when you transfer your bitcoins to your wallet.
You can also buy cryptocurrencies with a credit card if you don't want to wait a couple of days for your SEPA transfer to arrive into your Bitstamp account.
Bitstamp is great. I wouldn't recommend Kraken to anyone at the moment.

It makes sense to optimize transactions before committing to bigger blocks. If all transactions went through SegWit right now, everything would be fine while we wait for payment processors using Lightning Network to arrive. The only issue is that wallet apps and exchanges aren't implementing SegWit quickly enough. I don't doubt that blocks will become bigger in the future, that will always remain an option. Right now, we need to name and shame the companies that refuse to implement SegWit. Ideally, we should use their competitors, but it isn't easy to abandon a product you've been using for years and trust for a smaller competitor that doesn't have the same track record.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:31:46
Ethereum does something like this. You can buy a .eth address that works like a domain name and points to your complicated address. It would be trivial for Google to create a way to let you attach a bitcoin address to your GMail address and it would be trivial for wallet apps to check if there's a bitcoin address attached to an email address and send the funds if it's the case.

Don't buy any if you aren't into it. It's really simple. We don't expect people to do anything. I love the idea of being able to store some of my capital in my head just by remembering 12 words and being able to take this money with me everywhere I go. No one can tell that I carry thousands of euros in my head and no one can take that money from me. I could hop on a plane with just my passport and my clothes and be perfectly fine in a growing number of countries. That's innovative. That's worth something. Maybe not to you, but it is to me and millions of other people all over the world.

The Lightning Network won't be hard to use. You install the wallet, it offers to open a payment channel with your balance and you can make instantaneous and cheap (or free) transactions. The payment processor will have channels set up with all exchanges and major vendors. Advanced users will be able to tweak their payment channel, but everything will happen in the background for the average user. The cost of opening/closing a channel might even be paid by the payment processor as a way to attract users.

I agree. Most of them are only propped up by the fact that they're easier to mine than bitcoin. Miners convert their earnings into bitcoin or one of a very few more legitimate cryptocurrencies. When they get propped up by miners, they become interesting to traders and to a few people who buy the hype. I believe that these altcoins will get left behind and die out eventually and that only a handful of cryptocurrencies will endure. Bitcoin is my top choice, then Ethereum, then Monero, then Litecoin (only because it's old and will work in symbiosis with bitcoin.).

We sound like lunatics when we shit on major currencies. The immense majority of people are perfectly happy with currencies like the dollar or the euro. People also believe that a country without a monetary policy would be weaker economically. In my opinion, bitcoin is the most attractive as an international store of value that can be transmitted very easily and that's safe from seizure. I love the idea that anyone can hold millions in their memory and would be fine if they were dropped naked in any reasonably developed country.

What this tells you is that many users are overpaying because plenty of apps and websites force their users to overpay by suggesting needlessly high fees or by preventing people from modifying the recommended fee.
Thankfully, there are great exchanges like Bitstamp that batch their transactions, use SegWit and pay the fee to get your bitcoins to your wallet, even if it's just the equivalent of $30.

People would use SegWit if all wallet apps and exchanges supported it. Wallets apps and exchanges have been slow to adopt SegWit, that's where the issue lies. When your wallet app gives you a SegWit address and makes SegWit transactions by default and when exchanges offer cheaper fees if you send your bitcoins to a SegWit address, usage will skyrocket. People will always choose the lower fee, the problem is that they largely don't have that option right now.

You can choose a trustworthy vendor, but the vendor can't choose a trustworthy buyer. I think that both aspects are important and it's good that there are options that protect sellers too. The vendor is known and can easily be taken to court, but it's much more difficult to take a random buyer (who might have given you a fake name) to court for an abusive chargeback. I never expected cryptocurrencies to replace cash, but they can be an interesting alternative for products or services that suffer from a high rate of abusive chargebacks.

I don't, but Bitstamp batches its transactions and pays the fee. It's completely free for the user. You can provide them with a SegWit address and your future transaction fees out of your wallet will be cheaper as well.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:10:20
It's a big deal, although SegWit alone wouldn't guarantee low fees if a sizable percentage of the population wanted to use bitcoin for their daily shopping. That's what the Lightning Network is for.
The block size limit is at 1 MB currently. Thanks to SegWit, we've had blocks that exceeded 2 MB recently. It can more than double the number of transactions that can be processed every 10 minutes.
Adoption should keep increasing steadily. People who can choose between a normal transaction and a SegWit transaction will opt for the cheaper transaction all other things being equal.
Most exchanges and wallet apps should finish implementing SegWit in the coming months. Hardware wallets like the Trezor or the Ledger Nano S are already compatible.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:52:18
Bitcoin didn't split. Bitcoin Cash forked away from Bitcoin. There have been other forks before and there have been and will be other forks after the Bitcoin Cash fork. Most of these forks are failures though.
Bitcoin Core is a piece of software that works on the Bitcoin protocol, but there are other teams building other pieces of software. The team behind Bitcoin Core just happens to be the most active and competent team, so a majority of users choose their software. Any competent programmer can contribute to Bitcoin's development.
The only reason why Bitcoin transactions are expensive right now is because of Bitcoin's overwhelming success and because of spam transactions. SegWit addresses this directly. If all wallet apps and exchanges offered SegWit, the transactions would be affordable again while we wait for second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network.
Bitcoin Cash's only advantages is that it allows for bigger blocks and that its user base is much smaller than Bitcoin's, making Bitcoin Cash transactions much cheaper at the moment.
Bitcoin could kill Bitcoin Cash overnight by allowing miners to mine bigger blocks. They don't do it because it isn't a sustainable scaling solution. You evidently don't want everyone's morning coffee to be recorded in perpetuity on thousands of computers, it's a completely unreasonable waste of resources. If Bitcoin Cash became successful and was adopted widely for everyday transaction, its blocks would have to become huge, which would inevitably lead to dangerous centralization.
The team behind the Bitcoin Core software chose a much more reasonable route. With SegWit, they reduced the size of Bitcoin transactions so that more transactions can be crammed into each block. Implementing Schnorr signatures will result in another large efficiency gain. Then there's the Lightning Network that will allow users to make instantaneous and very cheap transactions.
These three technologies will make Bitcoin much more efficient and scalable than Bitcoin Cash. Most transactions should become SegWit transaction once SegWit is implemented by all wallet apps and exchanges. Many of them are dragging their feet for political reasons, but it should happen in the coming months. Many highly competent developers are working on Schnorr signatures and the Lightning Network. We should have them in 2018.

This is true, but why are you dismissing second-layer scaling solutions entirely? The Lightning Network is about to become an integral part of bitcoin.
Recording every single microtransaction on thousands of computers isn't reasonable, it's a massive waste of resources. Most competing cryptocurrencies couldn't do it. The Lightning Network addresses this issue in an elegant manner.

Atomic Swaps, yes. It's a great use case.
As for other use cases, it depends entirely on the level of trust you're willing to accept.
With cryptocurrencies, you can work with zero trust.
With a tracking number, you'd need to trust that the seller put the agreed upon object in the box. You could also put the money in escrow and the buyer would have to confirm that everything was fine for the funds to be released. If not, a fee would be transferred to a third party who would have to make a ruling.
With sporting bets, you could bet on the result of a game and the smart contract would distribute the money according to the results published in a feed.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:46:06
Yes, transactions will be instantaneous.
Opening and closing the payment channel isn't instantaneous (although it can be very quick if you pay a high fee) as it needs to be recorded on the blockchain, but that's something users will do immediately after installing a Lightning Network wallet on their device. Once the channel is open, your transactions are free and instantaneous.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:50:24
That is the point of the Lightning Network. The price of bitcoin would have to stabilize as well for it to be a great currency, but it is unrealistic to expect the price to be stable during the adoption phase. It will stabilize eventually.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:12:35
A larger percentage of the population owning bitcoin is adoption. It's adoption of the store of value use case. The market is also much more liquid than it was just last year. Bitcoin as a currency is a future use case. A second-layer scaling solution like the Lightning Network allows users to make instantaneous and nearly free transactions. Some people are using it already, although it's still being tested. For the price to be stable, we'll need a lot more liquidity still and that will happen once a non-negligible percentage of the population (at least 5%) has some bitcoins.

Mt.Gox's bankruptcy is a blessing in disguise for many people who would have sold their bitcoins had it been a possibility. (Assuming the bankruptcy trustee doesn't fuck us over by selling the 200,000 bitcoins that were recovered and only paying us slightly over $400 per bitcoin.)

I believe that a strong majority of people think the way you did if comments under news articles are any indication. Most of them discovered bitcoin in 2017. It's completely new to them. They haven't known about it for years like many of us, so it looks like a fad. The success stories sound too good to be true, so it also looks like a scam. I don't think that they'll have a change of heart anytime soon. Hearing about bitcoin in the news every now and again for a few years might do the trick though.

Good thinking. You could indeed have the addresses be single-use, with the service provider switching to the next deterministic address every time BTC are being received by the current address. If you let it run out of addresses, it goes back to the first address. Your wallet could send the provider a batch of hundreds of deterministic public addresses so that you wouldn't have to reveal your deterministic seed to the provider. The biggest hurdle, aside from security, would be to get wallet apps and exchanges to accept your DNS-like service.
I also believe that such a service is necessary if we want bitcoin to succeed.

The schadenfreude might be short-lived though, this is one of dozens of similar crashes that happened over the years. Nothing has fundamentally changed and cryptocurrencies remain just as innovative as they were yesterday. The indicators will turn green soon enough.

The argument that users don't want SegWit because they aren't using it is painfully bad. The only factor that prevents quick and massive adoption is service providers (mostly exchanges and wallet apps) not implementing SegWit quickly enough.
When you buy a Trezor, it gives you a SegWit address by default. When you buy bitcoins on Bitstamp, Bitstamp sends your bitcoins from a SegWit address. If all service providers did this, most moving bitcoins would end up in SegWit addresses.
I took advantage of the low average fee to move all of my bitcoins to a SegWit address. From now on, I doubt I'll ever have to send my bitcoins to a non-SegWit address again.
People, if given the option, will virtually always opt for the transaction with the lowest fee.

A few traders making money at the expense of many other people doesn't say anything about the cryptocurrency in question. Any flawed cryptocurrency can do this if it's marketed well for a few weeks or months. Plenty have.
Plenty of cryptocurrencies are shockingly overvalued for the simple reason that they're easier to mine for the average Joe than bitcoin.
Cryptocurrencies that don't have a community of true believers and two competent developers to replace every developer that loses interest are all doomed in my opinion.
It's great that you were able to make some money though of course. You were rewarded for the risk you were willing to take, for your ability to detect potential and for your luck. Nothing wrong with any of that.

Bitcoin is evolving harder than any other cryptocurrency with SegWit, Schnorr signatures and the Lightning Network. These innovations take time to implement, but we'll have them in 2018.
SegWit is there already, all that's needed now is for all wallet apps and exchanges to implement it.
Schnorr signatures will further increase bitcoin's efficiency by 25%, which is huge.
The Lightning Network will allow people to make everyday transactions and microtransactions, something that isn't possible now because of high fees.
Any properly decentralized cryptocurrency that aims to replace bitcoin would run into the exact same issues and would need second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network.

It's irrelevant now because there's virtually no backlog. Many of those 50K transactions have a deliberately low fee because the people who made are ok with waiting. As long as the transaction is going through in the next block for a fraction of a dollar, you're golden. People who pay $5.5 and up are wasting money, probably because the service they're using is forcing or encouraging them to pay a needlessly high fee. The worst thing that could happen right now with a $1 fee is that you need to wait for a couple of blocks.

If it reached $1,000, if it reached $10,000, it can also reach $100,000. The price is nothing more than high demand meeting inelastic supply. If there are 11M bitcoins already mined that aren't lost, 100 million people (1 human in 75 isn't impossible in the near future) could have 0.11 bitcoin each on average.
At $100,000 per bitcoin, each user could store $11,000 on average. We know that because of inelasticity, the market cap grows much more quickly than the amount of money that is actually injected into bitcoin. If 100 million people wanted to invest $11,000 each (or if 1 billion people wanted to invest $1,100 each), the price per bitcoin would be much higher than $100,000 per coin. The price increase past $100,000 would be purely mechanical.
I don't know whether or not bitcoin will reach $100,000 because I don't know if bitcoin will be successful on the long term or not. What I know is that if bitcoin succeeds on a large scale, it will reach $100,000 very easily.

I agree that the recent pressure (high average fee, overflowing mempool) was stressful, but it gave the community an incentive to start using SegWit, to request its implementation and to get acquainted with the Lightning Network. Without the pressure, we wouldn't have accomplished nearly as much in the last couple of months.
The average fee has decreased significantly and SegWit usage is up. Most exchanges and wallet apps are about to implement it. Coinbase will start batching its transactions. We're being forced to be efficient with our transactions and I think that's great. Schnorr signatures will improve efficiency by a further 25%.
Users wouldn't bother using the scaling solutions without a monetary incentive. Service providers wouldn't bother implementing the scaling solutions if users didn't request them.
We'll always have the option of increasing the block size. It's a powerful tool that we should use to decrease the pressure on the network when the scaling solutions get overwhelmed. If we decrease the pressure before the adoption of the scaling solutions, they won't be adopted and won't be ready when we truly need them.

No one is asking them to stop providing their service, we're asking them to be mindful and to batch the bitcoin transactions they send out. It's in everyone's interest, including their own. Right now, they're wasting a fortune in fees by sending every outgoing transaction as an individual transaction. This is slowing the network and causing other users to have to pay more fees than they should have to. They can afford to be wasteful because they make so much money, but it isn't reasonable and it's — in all likelihood — motivated by political reasons, namely wanting Bitcoin Cash to replace Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:35:49
Most people aren't because the most popular wallet apps still haven't implemented SegWit. 87% of transactions are still normal transactions.
Bitstamp is already compatible. If Coinbase gets its act together and starts batching transactions and sending them through SegWit, transactions will become even cheaper.

If you spend most of the year in another country, you can claim that you're residing there primarily and pay your taxes there instead of having to pay them in your country of origin. Of course, that doesn't work when you're from a country like the US since American citizens have to pay taxes in the US regardless of where they live and make their money.

Traders are still trading just as much. The network was congested because of the number of new users. Coinbase accounted for 58% of all transactions at some point. A series of frightening news scared the weaker hands away and reduced the influx of new users to a degree. I'm fairly confident that a new mania will happen at some point this year and fees will start to increase again, but by then the network should be able to deal with it without reaching a breaking point like it did a few times in 2017 when the mempool was overflowing. We could probably weather a new mania as long as all wallet apps and exchanges offer SegWit by default and as long as Coinbase batches its transactions.

I just bought my first ETH and LTC after being 100% into BTC since 2012.
I still think that nearly all altcoins are propped up artificially by the fact that they're easier to mine than bitcoin for the amateur miner. Services like NiceHash do more harm than good in my opinion, wasting resources on altcoins that wouldn't stand on their own if they weren't used principally to acquire bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:31:37
Another major issue is the huge transaction fee they force you to pay to get your bitcoins to your wallet. If they don't let users change the fee and don't implement SegWit, they'll never be able to compete with Bitstamp. Bitstamp covers the cost of the fee, which is a huge plus. There's also the fact that Bitstamp lets you buy cryptocurrencies instantly with a credit card. Kraken's only advantage is that they work with more cryptocurrencies.

My theory is that the company behind the wallet would create a Lightning node to become a payment processor or get into a partnership with a payment processor. You would commit your balance (or a fraction of your balance) upon installing the wallet and this would automatically open a channel with the payment processor. 
You can then make cheap or free instantaneous transactions with all exchanges and major retailers as the payment processor would have channels open with them. Basically, the only difference with normal wallets would be the need to open a channel with the payment processor.
Your bitcoins would still be shown in your balance and you would still be able to make a normal transaction with them, but the wallet would warn you that doing so would result in the closure of your channel with the payment processor if your balance isn't high enough.
Unless you choose to mess with the options, you wouldn't have to know how the Lightning Network works to use it as long as you trust your wallet.
I envision that some wallets would pay the fees to open and close the channel as a way to attract users. They might recoup their money by charging a small fee for each transaction or by charging a fee for other services such as the ability to buy other cryptocurrencies through Atomic Swaps directly in the wallet.

Bitstamp is so good. They pay the fee to send your bitcoins to your wallet and will send them to a SegWit address if you provide them with one. It will then be cheaper to send your bitcoins out of your wallet. They batch their outgoing transactions and your bitcoins arrive in your wallet quickly. I used to buy my bitcoins through Bitstamp, then I forgot that I had an account there and wasted so much money using Kraken.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:08:44
I don't really understand your comment.
SegWit and Schnorr signatures are optimizations of the transactions. Implementing and using them would fix the problems we're encountering right now while we wait for the Lightning Network to be implemented and used. These are the solutions favored by the team behind the Bitcoin Core software.
If the block size needs to be increased after that, then it will most likely be increased.

They usually give you a delay, telling you that the account will be closed at some date in the future. This gives you enough time to open an account at another bank and transfer the money there. If there's money in the account at the time of the closure, they offer to transfer it for you or they might ask you to come in and give you a check or cash.

It's a legal right in France as well, but a bank can still close your account. If a bank refuses to let you open a new account, you can go to the Banque de France (which is the central bank of France) and they can force a bank of their choosing to give you a bank account.

It's extremely wasteful to record each unimportant microtransaction on thousands of computers. You don't want every $0.10 tip to waste many dollars in resources. The Lightning Network allows users to make these unimportant transactions off-chain in a perfectly secure manner. The final balance ends up being recorded on the blockchain at the end, but all the transactions in between are instantaneous and free. It's a very elegant way of scaling bitcoin so that it can serve hundreds of millions of users while remaining decentralized and cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:26:57
The supply of bitcoins is inelastic by design while the demand has been growing strongly. If bitcoin continues to be successful and expand its user base, further price increases will be mechanical. Only a massive and sustained influx of bitcoins from one or more whales can negate a price increase when the user base is growing.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:35:40
The comments under the article are very interesting as well. Nearly all of them are highly negative. According to the article, Coinbase has 13 million active accounts and we've just learned that it's responsible for over half of all bitcoin transactions. The adoption phase has barely started. 
If a price of $10,000+ is sustainable with the current number of users, I think that bitcoin can easily pull off another 10X or even 100X.
The value of bitcoin has grown by 250,000% ever since I bought my first bitcoins in 2012 and I believed that I was too late back then already. Bitcoin doesn't feel substantially different in terms of how the general public is approaching it. The house cleaner mentioned in the article is still a pioneer in my opinion.

I'm surprised it doesn't exist already. A bank that just keeps your money safe for a low fee, gives you access to online banking and an optional debit card and nothing more.

If I could switch to cheaper and simpler bank, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

It can be a cryptocurrency with a good second-layer solution that second-layer solutions are being worked on right now. The price also needs to stabilize, which isn't a reasonable expectation since we're in the adoption phase and since the supply is inelastic by design.

I think that the crash happened because of a conjunction of multiple slightly bad or scary news that eroded people's hopefulness. The Chinese New Year might have played a role, but I don't think that it deserves the credit for this crash.
The most important factor in my opinion is human psychology turning every notable dip into a crash. Something triggers an unusually large sale, which in turn triggers some stop loss orders, which then triggers panic, smart traders smell blood and sell to buy back at a lower point, weak hands sell because an idiot wrote that bitcoin is dead, more stop loss orders are triggered, etc... It's a vicious cycle that echoes a few times, removing $1000 from the price every time.
The same thing has happened so many times.

All we need is a single payment processors that has channels open with all major exchanges and all major retailers. Any largish exchange would own enough bitcoins to support this.

Fees dropped a lot.
He paid $1 for this transaction and that was expensive. A typical transaction is cheaper than $1 now.
Transactions were expensive recently for a few reasons. The network was congested by a massive influx of new users and because Coinbase makes a huge amount of inefficient transactions, wasting millions in transaction fees. Coinbase pledged that they would start batching their transactions, which will significantly relieve the pressure on the network. What's more, SegWit adoption is increasing, so more transactions are recorded in each block, further lowering the pressure on the network.
The person this thread is about moved his bitcoins from a normal address to a SegWit address. A SegWit address starts with a "3" instead of a "1". You can do a SegWit transaction by sending bitcoins from a SegWit address to another SegWit address using a SegWit-compatible wallet. SegWit transactions are cheaper than normal transactions because SegWit reduces the average size of a transaction.

Cryptocurrencies are a tiny market. Don't let yourself get fooled by thinking that the market cap is a useful indicator to gauge the size of cryptocurrencies compared to companies. It's just useful to rank cryptocurrencies. It makes very little sense to multiply the current price by the number of available tokens since only a tiny fraction of those tokens are worth anywhere close to the current price. If you want to estimate the size of bitcoin, ask 100 people in the developed world to talk to you about bitcoin. You'll realize that most of them don't have a clue. The biggest exchange only has 13 million accounts and it accounts for 58% of all bitcoin transactions. We're talking about an international product that doesn't even have 100 million users. Cryptocurrency remains a tiny market and everyone is an early adopter at this point.

Payment processors might charge a fee for each transaction, but it will have to be very low or the users will use a different payment processor.

The extra money comes from the facts that bitcoin is in an adoption phase and that the supply is inelastic. There are more people wanting to buy bitcoins than there are people willing to sell theirs. The price will get a chance to stabilize once everyone has had the opportunity to ask themselves if they want or need some bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:23:46
I disagree. You can't really mistype the address and lose your money as the mistyped address won't be a valid bitcoin address in all likelihood. Your wallet verifies the validity of an address before it sends the funds.
What could realistically happen is sending too much money to the vendor. It becomes the vendor's responsibility to refund you and it's your responsibility to choose a trustworthy vendor.
Abusive chargebacks are a real issue for sellers. That's why it's practically impossible to sell cryptocurrencies or gift cards through PayPal. Bitcoin addresses that. The seller can't check the trustworthiness of the buyer before the transaction happens, but the buyer can check the trustworthiness of the seller.
As a seller, you can't fully trust PayPal, you can't fully trust credit cards and even bank transfers can be reverted. If you need to be certain that you won't be scammed, you need to be paid with cash, with a bank cheque or with Western Union. All three methods are highly impractical for online transactions.
Cryptocurrencies (after price stabilization and low fees) solve this problem. Cryptocurrencies even give you the option to not have to trust the buyer or the seller. Say you want to buy some Litecoins and pay with Bitcoin. You can put the Bitcoins in escrow, the seller can put the Litecoins in escrow and as soon as both have done it, the cryptocurrencies get exchanged automatically. Isn't that a great niche to fill?

You're completely right. What plenty of people fail to see though is that mainstream awareness of bitcoin is barely starting. When an interesting asset only has an adoption of ~1% in the developed world, there's still plenty of exponential growth on the horizon. If we go from ~1% to ~5% in the next couple of years, there will be exponential growth. If Wall Street money gets in, there will be exponential growth. The supply is too inelastic for anything else. The price of bitcoin will start stabilizing once most people and companies have gotten a chance to decide whether or not they want some bitcoins.

In theory, the user. The wallet could explain the fee as a subscription fee to the service.

That's like asking what a fair price for gold is. Obviously, it must cost more than its production cost. 1 troy ounce of gold must cost more than what it costs to extract it from the ground, refine it and assay it. 1 bitcoin must cost more than what it costs to mine it and secure the network.
The price of gold is somewhat influenced by the price of other metals. Theoretically, a troy ounce of gold could cost $1,000,000, but it would lead companies to use other metals with similar properties when they can and at $3215 per gram (the smallest practical amount), many investors would be priced out of the market.
Bitcoin doesn't have these limitations. The price has a lower limit, but the upper limit is anyone's guess. If you consider that 10% of the world population will ultimately use bitcoin and that the average user will store $1,000 in bitcoin, the fair price per bitcoin would be $50,000 with a supply of 15M bitcoins (current active supply). You might need to double or triple this price to account for powerful Wall Street-flavored investors.

It would be nice if each user had how much BTC he owns and when he started investing written next to his username. It would also be very useful to know if they have a significant position in another cryptocurrency. Of course, users who own many BTC would just paint a target on their back, so it isn't practical.
One thing that can be done is to downvote price predictions that aren't supported by a reasonable and solid explanation. Know-it-alls who talk out of their ass are hurting newcomers unnecessarily.

Let's not turn the white paper into a holy text.
When Satoshi was active, he didn't get to see the blocks being filled with spam. He didn't get to see Chinese miners having a disproportionate amount of power. He didn't see them waste blocks with ASICBoost.
Bitcoin has to evolve to compete with newer altcoins and it needs to be able to withstand mass adoption.
It was never reasonable to use energy on thousands of computers to record millions of coffees individually every day.
The transactions still need to be settled on the bitcoin blockchain. It's an oversimplification, but SegWit and the Lightning Network just compress everything to make the transactions more efficient.
It was smart to use paper instead of carrying gold back and forth. It only became a problem when the government started creating more paper than there was gold. There's absolutely no risk of this happening with bitcoin.
Let's not resort to dubious comparisons to try to associate the Lightning Network to things people here don't like.

There are no transaction fees when you're a trader because your money stays at the exchange and the exchange uses an internal ledger to move cryptocurrencies and money from one user to the next. The only fees come from the exchanges, not from the bitcoin network. The only traders who pay fees to the bitcoin network are the ones who take advantage of price differences between exchanges. Buying at the exchange with the cheapest price and selling at the exchange with the highest price requires you to make actual bitcoin transactions as you move your bitcoins from one exchange to the next.

If you’re into bitcoin, you know that it’s unrealistic to ask for stability when bitcoin is barely starting to reach mainstream awareness. The demand is exploding while the supply is inelastic by design. This can only result in volatility (rallies and corrections), it’s mechanical. The price will stabilize eventually once every potential user knows about bitcoin. 
If you’re into bitcoin, you know that the Lightning Network is just around the corner, you know that it will create an industry of large payment processors and that it will allow instantaneous and cheap transactions.

Channels aren't very useful without the network. It's the network aspect that will make the Lightning Network a must have for all major vendors. You will subscribe to a major intermediary and this intermediary will do business with all major vendors. This will allow you to make all your small transactions through the intermediary for extremely low fees and instantaneously.

If BCH succeeds, the blocks will need to be huge and this would inevitably lead to a lot of centralization. The Lightning Network is a much more elegant solution and if it catches on, it will offer faster and cheaper transactions than BCH, making BCH completely redundant. BTC is where it's at.

That's a cool thread! I might have read it at the time as this was just before I bought my first bitcoins. I didn't remember that their cost was 1.85 BTC. When I considered buying a silver coin, they were already too expensive. It makes me wonder how much your coin is worth today and how many 1000 BTC gold coins are still funded. Did you consider having it slabbed?

I've been buying and spending bitcoins for well over 5 years. I've lived through so many scary price movements that they don't faze me anymore, especially when they aren't caused by bad news.
I sold everything out of panic once, in 2013, when Silk Road was closed and it taught me a very valuable (though costly) lesson. The safest thing to do during a crash is to wait it out.
My bitcoins are safely in their wallet, I don't keep them at an exchange, so quick transactions to profit from the crash would've been costly and potentially dangerous. I spent over 1500€ though, 1000€ in BTC for my father, the rest in ETH for myself.
You can call bullshit, but you'd be wrong. If I believed that bitcoin was in any danger, I would've sold everything, but I know better. These price movements that happen for no good reason are the least likely to have lasting consequences.

I just withdrew my last 0.1 BTC because my trust is waning and experienced ~5 Cloudflare errors, an internal error that forced me to start the process again and I was forced to pay just under 15€ for the transaction fee. Anyone using Kraken now is going to encounter these problems. Not being able to pay a lower fee for a slower transaction made me consider converting these 0.1 BTC into another cryptocurrency, which is something I haven't done in 5 years. It pisses me off to have to waste almost 15€ like that.

Bitcoin exists to do both. It can do both very well. There's no reason to restrict bitcoin to the use case we've been forced to stick with. I got into bitcoin in 2012 because of Silk Road and bitcoin worked better back then. We NEED SegWit implementation, the Lightning Network and small block size increases as needed after that. Right now, all efforts should be focused on the Lightning Network. Large payment processors operating on the Lightning Network will be created because it can be very profitable to become one early.

No one can cancel a transaction with bitcoin. It's a feature to prevent fraudulent chargebacks. Scientific police can examine the logs in the hope that the thief was careless and the police can interview the people who had access to the wallet.

Exactly, offering services that secure their clients' bitcoins is a huge opportunity for rich companies that have their shit together. They can hire the best programmers and network administrators.

I'm still glad to have some precious metals, but you won't ever catch me buying another gram of gold or silver bullion. It's hard for me to accept that I spent so much on gold and silver and so little on bitcoin in spite of the fact that I got into both at roughly the same time.

Mt.Gox started as a Magic the Gathering exchange before growing to handle most purchases and sales of BTC. When Mt.Gox became big, they should have had the website rewritten completely by highly competent programmers and they should have implemented monitoring and security tools. The same thing happened with NiceHash. They had $65M in a hot wallet. This is unforgivable. This isn't an issue with cryptocurrencies, the problem is that people give their trust to amateurs. This is a huge opportunity for companies that have their shit together. A company that has its shit together would insure the money or it would be able to cover the theft of its hot wallet. Bitcoin is perfectly viable now. Keep your bitcoins in your own wallet and no one will be able to take them from you if you aren't careless.

A correction isn't needed though. It probably will happen, if only because too many newcomers have never seen a dip and aren't prepared psychologically for one, but the current price of bitcoin merely reflects rising awareness. The number of mobile phone users never decreased because mobile phones are very useful. Cryptocurrencies are revolutionary and getting better every day. Now that the cat is out of the bag, it isn't going to be put back in. I think that bitcoin can weather any crash that isn't linked to a massive flaw in the technology or a huge regulatory attack.

SegWit launched a few months ago and its usage will skyrocket once all exchanges and wallet apps implement it and offer it by default. Coinbase just announced that they would launch SegWit soon. This will result in lower fees and faster confirmations.
The Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to be used for instantaneous micropayments with extremely cheap fees and will increase bitcoin's capacity to levels that can't be matched by any other cryptocurrency.
We'll always have the option to increase the block size as needed. It will happen at some point, but it would be irresponsible to do it without optimizing bitcoin through SegWit and the Lightning Network first.

Please tell me what you consider to be an inconvenient with this solution.
The payment processors aren't going to affect our transactions. They might even pay to open the channels if they can earn money selling bitcoins directly in the wallet app.
A bigger payment processor implies direct routes to everyone that matters, but anyone can be part of the Lightning Network and offer cheaper fees or routes to sellers selling illegal products.
It makes infinitely much more sense than having thousands of computers waste a disproportionate (and frankly unethical) amount of energy for everyone's morning coffee.
You can always choose to have your transaction recorded in the blockchain if that's your wish.

Bitcoin has many use cases.
It's unrealistic to expect bitcoin to be a functional currency when bitcoin is barely starting to receive attention from the general public and Wall Street. The supply is inelastic by design and the demand is exploding. This volatility is mechanical and compounded by bouts of frenzy. The price will stabilize eventually, but a large portion of bitcoin's potential users need to be aware of its existence first. We'll have a much clearer view of bitcoin's potential as a currency in a couple of years. By then, the Lightning Network (instantaneous and very cheap transactions on a large scale) will have gotten a chance to be implemented and serious payment processors will be able to serve millions of users.
Right now, bitcoin is mainly used as an easily-transferable international reserve of value and as a speculative instrument. I'm completely fine with this and quite excited about bitcoin's near-term future.
For the first time in history, a person can carry any amount of money on themselves completely stealthily and with no risk of theft or confiscation, just by remembering 12 words. This is revolutionary and exciting.

If bitcoin catches on, we won't be using bitcoin debit cards anymore. They're used now because most vendors don't accept bitcoin directly and everything is price in local currency.

Having to comb through an extreme amount of memes and shitposts is a fairly new development and I believe that it's a side effect of bitcoin's dramatic rise in value. Pure speculators who don't believe in bitcoin itself will upvote easily digestible memes to the front page, which only brings more of these uninformed speculators to the subreddit.
We get the pleasure of seeing our capital rise in value, but the quality of the discussion takes a dive and it hurts bitcoin's image. A single good meme to celebrate every small milestone ($1,000) is fine, however constant all time high alerts whenever a rally happens are awful.
These people are the ones who cause 20%+ dips because they're so quick to think that bitcoin is crashing to zero at the first sign of a small dip. I think that the next bad news related to regulation is going to have a very brutal effect on the price because of them.
I'd happily trade some of the insane price increases for curious users who know what bitcoin is and how it works before they make their first purchase.
The guy who replied "Borringg" under my comment gives ammo to the people who shout "bubble" whenever bitcoin is mentioned. My average cost is low enough that I'll be able to weather an insane temporary crash or a lasting price correction, but I don't want bitcoin's image to be damaged while our beloved cryptocurrency is in the spotlight.

You can't keep your credit card in your memory, it has to be carried on your person and can be confiscated, stolen, damaged or cancelled. The vast majority of credit cards have a spending limit, you can't carry $1M like you could with bitcoin. Your credit card doesn't give you access to an international currency. Spending your money abroad usually costs various types of fees. You must also trust your bank and your government not to freeze or take your money. Plenty of people have had their credit card cancelled because they spent money abroad and their bank considered that it was suspicious. If you're abroad, it might ruin your trip. If you get mugged, the mugger could take you to ATMs and force you to withdraw money until you reach your spending limit. Lastly, you can't give money to a person with a credit card.

You can and you should, but if you don't have much, it could cost a large part of your capital in fees. I'm in Europe, so I don't use Coinbase, but I believe that you can transfer them to a wallet for free if you go through GDAX. If you have to pay a fee, I'd wait until the fees get lower. Making a transaction with SegWit (Coinbase and GDAX have yet to implement SegWit) and doing it at a time when there's no backload of transactions will minimize the cost of moving your bitcoins to your own wallet.

They tried to co-opt the bitcoin brand, attacking BTC with no regard for the user's savings. The original Bitcoin Foundation was awful and populated by criminals. The people behind the New York Agreement were awful, just look at what happened with SegWit2x. No one would have lost money or risked losing money without multiple attempts at taking over.

I bought my first bitcoins for 4.5€ each and used to spend them as quickly as I could, afraid that they would lose their value. I could easily have become a multimillionaire, but I did not have the foresight to keep some of my bitcoins as an investment. When I finally decided to keep some, I sold them for 100€ each out of panic in 2013. It took me 2 years to learn to do the right thing.
People who bought many bitcoins when they were worth very little and who managed to keep them until 2017 were not lucky, they were savvy.
They were curious enough to look into something that very few people cared about and were smart enough to realize that bitcoin had a lot of potential. Bitcoins were easy to lose and hard to hold on to after many price surges and many crashes.

That's what I meant, getting it graded by one of the major grading services, PCGS or NGC. They're extremely trustworthy and handle coins worth millions. As far as I know, the only way to get it graded by PCGS or NGC in person is at a coin show where they're present. Even if your coin would be safe, I realize how stressful it could be to have your coin shipped to strangers. It would've been easier to do when bitcoin's price wasn't so high. It isn't a huge deal that it isn't slabbed anyway. I don't have any slabbed coins myself since I collect ancient coins and it isn't typical to get them slabbed as grading services don't offer a guarantee of authenticity for ancient coins, but I think that it's worth it for an intact Casascius coin, if only to protect the hologram and offer a guarantee that it wasn't tempered.

Bitcoin is worth over $10,000 right now because the supply is inelastic by design and because the demand is very strong as awareness has risen sharply. Most people still don't know what bitcoin is and this means that the price of bitcoin will mechanically be much higher as a sizable percentage of humans ask themselves whether or not bitcoin is for them. If 100 million people owned bitcoin (1 in 75 humans, which is very reasonable), each person could only own 0.16 BTC worth less than $2000 at today's price. We know that ultimately there will be more than 100 million users on the planet and we know that people will want to store much more than $2000. Keep in mind also that financial companies have huge amounts of money to invest and that a non negligible percentage of bitcoins have been lost. A $10,000 bitcoin is cheap. That's a much better argument than the expression of your feelings.

When bitcoin grows by 20%, your capital grows by 20%. The same is true for litecoin. It doesn't matter which cryptocurrency you buy. Having lots of cheap units or having part of an expensive unit is exactly the same thing. There's no reason to expect litecoin to grow more than bitcoin, the star of the show. The only people who think that they can't afford to buy bitcoin are people who mistakenly believe that they have to buy an entire bitcoin.

Non-confiscatable store of value, international currency and stealthy and secure transport of funds by memorizing 12 words are 3 important use cases offered by bitcoin and there are others. It's true that even more can be done with the blockchain though, but bitcoin has more than a single use case.

If you had your BTC in a deterministic wallet (the ones you can recover with a seed), the simplest way to get your BCH is to move your BTC to another wallet for total safety and recover the seed of your previous wallet in a wallet app that supports BCH. I used Coinomi. The only slightly technical part is that you need to write *M/44H/0H/0H* as the derivation path of your BCH wallet. Nothing bad can happen if you mess up, you will just have to try again and do it properly. You can then send your BCH to your favorite exchange and sell them there. Be careful not to move your BCH to your BTC address at the exchange, your exchange will give you a BCH address if it supports BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:25:49
It will most likely be much easier in practice.
In all likelihood, you will download a wallet made by a big Lightning payment processor and install it on your mobile phone. Buy some bitcoins directly in the wallet or scan your seed or private key. It opens a channel with the payment processor automatically and that payment processor has channels opened with all exchanges and major places where you can spend your bitcoins. Everything happens in the background unless you choose to mess with your wallet's options. 
The average user will just send and receive bitcoins instantly and cheaply without needing to know how the Lightning Network works.

People who aren't familiar with bitcoin have been saying this for the past 9 years. I've been buying bitcoin since 2012 and I'm never worried about anything, I let it do its thing. Regardless of the price, bitcoin is a very cool technology back by a very strong network and great code.

Alright, your original comment sounded so confident that I thought that you'd want the easy $250 or $500.
I don't think that anyone can speak with conviction about the future of bitcoin and I tend to dismiss comments like yours just as much as I dismiss comments that are overconfident about bitcoin's ability to replace national currencies. Many naysayers feel that the price is growing too quickly and derive their opinion about bitcoin from this feeling alone, completely ignoring its present and future use cases. It's a mistake.
Bitcoin has been carving its niche happily for 9 years now (plenty of people think that it just appeared) and has seen years with stronger growth than 1500%. When something that can theoretically be useful to billions of people starts from 0 and gets a huge amount of press coverage, this type of growth isn't shocking. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:36:42
Somehow the price swings don't faze me, I don't know if it's because I've grown numb to them, or because the price could crash by more than 90% and I still would make a profit, or because I just don't care much about money. I'm sorry to hear that it could go so far as to affect your health. I used to think that I'd take my gains when they'd pay for an apartment. Then I thought that I'd take half my gains when they'd pay for an apartment and leave the other half in bitcoin. I looked at boats yesterday for the first time. Right now, I'd take half my gains if they paid for a house in France (where I live) and a studio apartment in New York City. My dreams grow with the price, but I don't believe in them so much that it would destroy me if I had to abandon them. I'm just having fun on the rollercoaster and if I'm very lucky, my dreams will come true. Bitcoin is a great thing regardless of its price.

My go-to pitch when I talk about bitcoin is that for the first time in history, a person can carry any amount of money on themselves completely stealthily and with no risk of theft or confiscation, just by remembering 12 words. This is revolutionary. You could travel to a foreign country with $0, exchange some BTC for local currency upon arrival and even pay some of your meals or your hotel bill directly with BTC. I never say that bitcoin will replace cash, because most people are perfectly happy with cash and I don't think that it will anyway.

That's what happened when the price went from $11,000 to $8,600 in minutes a couple of days ago, but it seems like panic selling at the first sign of your first dip is a rite of passage for greed-flavored newcomers who don't know anything about bitcoin. It just transfers money from the weakest to the strongest hands and teaches them a valuable lesson they won't forget. Not a big deal in my opinion. We warn them again and again not to panic sell, but these people often didn't bother reading anything because they're so afraid of missing out.

You could've made deterministic wallets. Typing a 12-word seed takes less than a minute and they would've had the full 0.01 BTC in their wallet. Knowing that you can't lose your funds as long as you keep the seed safe is a good thing to teach to newcomers. It's not as if we didn't know about the high fees in advance.

This was always an unreasonable objective in my opinion. The vast majority of Westerners are perfectly happy with their dollars and euros, even with the (manageable) inflation. I'm a fairly early adopter, but I never believed that cryptocurrencies could do better than just coexist with national currencies and serve a slightly different role. In my opinion, bitcoin has a much better chance at becoming a currency used as an international store of value.

It's your job to secure your funds. It can be done easily. It was your decision to trust people who didn't deserve your trust, either because they weren't competent enough to secure their bitcoins or because they ran with your money.

When Mt.Gox lost my money, I didn't complain about bitcoin, that's just silly.

Some altcoins have great features (Ethereum, Monero), but the vast majority of altcoins are just used because they're easy to mine with graphics cards. These altcoins are propped up by miners who immediately convert the cryptocurrency they mined into bitcoin and by naive people who buy into them. In my opinion, nearly all altcoins are just a giant waste of resources. I never bought any other cryptocurrency than bitcoin since 2012, but I wouldn't mind having some Ethereum (smart contracts), Monero (anonymity) and maybe Litecoin (might play an important role in association with bitcoin once we have the Lightning Network).

I told my friends that they might want to buy a few bitcoins when the price was under $5 and nobody did. Now they act like I never told them. I spoke about bitcoin with my doctor a couple of years ago and he was quite interested. He brought the topic up a few days ago and told me that he never bought any after all. It's their loss.
I don't recommend bitcoin anymore now. Too many weak hands joined purely out of greed in the past 6 months and I just don't trust them. Many of them are too quick to panic and overreact. I think that they make bitcoin much more dangerous than it was when most users were passionate about it and knowledgeable.
If your friends don't buy and bitcoin keeps succeeding, they resent you for making easy money, forgetting that it took some courage to risk money when bitcoin was much smaller and to hold through dozens of dips and some major crashes. If they buy some and it crashes, they resent you because they consider that you're responsible for their loss. It's not worth the trouble.

1) You can memorize your credit card numbers, but this would just work for online purchases, physical places require you to swipe it.
2) If you get your credit card stolen, you'll be without a card for a few days and it will potentially ruin your trip.
3) If you stick $1M in a checking account, most of that money will not be insured and will be at the mercy of a financial crisis. No one does this.
4) I talked about fees.
5) The Lightning Network will make payments instantaneous and fees extremely low.
6) If bitcoin succeeds, getting local currency for it won't be an issue. Right now, if I'm going abroad, I take my credit card and enough foreign currency. This may change in the near future if bitcoin becomes ubiquitous.
7) A criminal can't know that you have any bitcoins in your memory. If you're paranoid, memorize 24 words instead of 12 and give him the wallet that contains a tiny amount which is there solely for plausible deniability.
8) There's no risk with bitcoin.

I had forgotten about the lack of ID. Most places that don't require an ID are shady and could be a scam. Legitimate companies have to know who their customers are because of anti-money laundering laws. You should be able to find someone in your city willing to sell some to you for cash (so that they can avoid paying taxes on capital gains), but I wouldn't know how to find someone like that. Maybe at a bitcoin meetup. Any payment method where you can request a chargeback won't be available to you without an ID. The easiest way would probably to have a friend or family member with an ID buy them for you. Good luck!

Bitcoin always had intermediaries who verify and record your transactions so that your recipients can see them and spend the bitcoins you sent to their addresses. Your bitcoins were never exchanged with your recipients directly. You don't have to give your trust to anybody with the Lightning Network, they can't mess with your bitcoins, the protocol protects you against scammers and even rewards you if your interlocutor tries to scam you. The only trust involved is in choosing your wallet app, but that was always the case and is the case with every other cryptocurrency.

It doesn't have to be used as a currency to be valuable. Currently, its primary use case is a reserve of value. Again, 100 million people storing ~$2,000 each leads to today's price.

You can't keep your credit card in your memory, it has to be carried on your person and can be taken from you. The vast majority of credit cards have spending limits, you can't carry $1M like you could with bitcoin. Your credit card allows you to spend your country's currency, not an international currency. Lastly, you must trust your bank and your government not to freeze or take your money. Plenty of people have had their credit card voided because they spent money abroad and their bank considered that it was suspicious.

It weathered quantitative easing after quantitative easing and the stock market is doing great.

Exactly. I’ll add that there’s no reason to be bothered by dips because the price always bounces back. We aren’t lying when we say that they’re temporary opportunities to lower your average cost if you’re new to bitcoin. A major crash where everyone is running for the exit doesn’t look like a dip, it’s much more violent. If that happens, you won’t be able to get your money out, so you might as well hunker down for the long night and potentially use the crash as an opportunity to multiply the number of bitcoins you hold. Fortunes are made during crashes.

In this case I wouldn't touch it. The physical coin is more valuable unpeeled and becomes rarer and rarer as other owners peel the sticker.

I don't think that everyone knows about bitcoin, far from it. Plenty of people have heard the word "bitcoin", but if they aren't actively interested, it won't register. Reddit isn't an accurate representation of the general public.

I live in a small town in France and bitcoin isn't on anyone's radar yet.

It doesn't feel right because it wouldn't be right for any other asset to move like this, but keep in mind that bitcoin is in a class of its own and that the 9 years of continuous growth (minus a couple of blips) are a direct result of rising awareness about bitcoin's existence. The supply of new bitcoins is very limited while the demand is very high. The only real danger to the price is that a sizable percentage of users don't understand bitcoin and are here only for speculation, which introduces some fragility. The percentage of bitcoin users is still a minuscule fraction of the world population, so if awareness keeps rising, we can expect the price to keep growing exponentially before we can even entertain the idea of a stabilization.

Are you sure that the money is still in the wallet?
In my experience, when the seed is wrong or when a password is required, it shows you an error message and doesn't let you see the balance.
The old seed could be incompatible with newer wallets. For instance, you wouldn't be able to use a seed created with Armory in a new wallet on your mobile phone, you'd have to download Armory and the entire blockchain to retrieve the bitcoins.

The only thing that compares is a massive (50%+) crash. Bitcoin is silly, but not nearly as silly as what you've seen so far. Read, read, read!

You being too late is infinitely less likely than a global switch from national currencies to bitcoin.

It happened at $5,000, but to be fair, the price went from $5,000 to $10,000 in just a few weeks. When I found an article about bitcoin in my regional newspaper in France when the price hit $5,000, I braced for impact.

A transfer from a Japanese bank account to a Japanese exchange and an international bank transfer are different animals. A Frenchman sending his money to Poland (or god forbid, to the US) could never expect a 3-hour wire transfer, even with all the regulations in the world. All major exchanges are already complying with national and international regulations. They all identify their clients for anti-money laundering purposes.

I disagree, Bitcoin's brand recognition is what makes it much more desirable than other cryptocurrencies to newcomers. If a cryptocurrency's brand wasn't extremely important, other cryptocurrencies would have overtaken bitcoin by now, but bitcoin still reigns supreme and in my humble opinion, will never lose the special aura it acquired by being the first cryptocurrency.

What I wrote was perfectly factual. I want bitcoin to succeed, I believe in its potential. Ridiculous statements saying that bitcoin can't be taken seriously because of the incompetence or dishonesty of a single business owner should be called out for what they are. If that person wanted bitcoin to be as unreliable as PayPal for sellers, he shouldn't have bothered, but I suspect that greed got the best of him.
Your comment history indicates that you want bitcoin to fail. I'd love to know what motivates you to spend some of your time and energy in as there isn't anything to gain from bitcoin failing. Will you say that the bubble is popping every time there's a temporary dip like you did 7 days ago in the hope that you'll be vindicated one day?

It would be interesting to see the actual cost of a $3 on-chain transaction being confirmed and stored on so many computers. It's a waste of resources in my opinion. The Lightning Network can't come quickly enough.

You can't carry your cash on your person completely securely though. Large sums take a lot of space. Cops or border agents can seize it, so it's going to have to stay in your country and ideally in your house. Assuming that you can hide it well enough that you'll never have to worry about theft or confiscation, which is a stretch, it could still get destroyed by fire, water or rodents. Then there's the fact that many countries forbid cash purchases above a certain amount, which can be quite low. Also, I'm only 34 and live in a rich Western country, yet I've seen my country's bank notes become obsolete 3 times.
Using bitcoin securely is super easy with deterministic wallets (wallet apps and hardware wallets) that provide you with a 12+-word seed. This level of security is completely sufficient. If you delete the wallet and memorize the seed, no one can know that you own bitcoins and no one can force you to make a transaction. Hardware wallets are foolproof and hack-proof and if you're dealing with a large sum, that's what you're going to use. Reasonably careful people don't have viruses on their phones. With time, securing your bitcoins is getting increasingly easier.
A physical deterministic cold wallet generator with its own screen and open source code could be made for $5 and it would be completely foolproof and hack-proof. You could house them in a temper-proof housing with no port, only 1 physical button and power it with a solar cell.
Banks only insure relatively small sums (100,000€ per client in my country) and don't protect your money from garnishment, seizure or an incompetent government that destroys the national currency like in Venezuela. Bank runs have happened recently in Greece. I don't doubt that services that offer insured bitcoin wallets will appear at some point though, but they'll negate the censorship resistance of bitcoin and I wouldn't use them personally, but paranoid people might.
Bitcoin will be used as a currency after the implementation of the Lightning Network and once the price gets a chance to stabilize. The day PayPal or Amazon starts accepting it, adoption will explode. You can already spend your bitcoins though PayPal or Amazon with a bitcoin debit card, but it's a stop-gap service. People in China have embraced WeChat Pay and you can already live in Chinese cities without ever touching cash or a credit card. They even pay their utilities through WeChat Pay. This will happen in the West too eventually and hopefully bitcoin will be practical enough to be integrated in what will become the equivalent of WeChat Pay.
WeChat Pay has over 600 million users and Alipay has over 450 million users. That's just one country and the technology is very new. Bitcoin is international and has plenty of great features.

They'll say that you were just lucky and that you don't deserve this money since you didn't work for it. They'll forget that it took some determination to hold through insane swings, scary news and hoards of smug know-it-alls repeating that we're fools for investing money in a scam. I suspect that many of them claim that it's a scam to reassure themselves because they think that they missed out and don't want to bother looking into the technology.

There really should be a penalty for abusive chargebacks. After all, they're lying in a signed statement and defrauding the vendor.
A client of mine recently initiated a chargeback on a 6 month old transaction that went through PayPal. The bank took the money from PayPal and PayPal took it in my PayPal account with an additional 16 euros as a penalty for the chargeback.
To my surprise, making a new invoice that mentions interests after 60 days did the trick. I suppose that the buyer thought that I wouldn't bother trying to get my money since it's only 75 euros.
Fucking banks, fucking PayPal.

I certainly didn't hold in 2012. I was too scared that my &lt;$5 bitcoins would lose their value and that I would have to wire money again to Mt.Gox and wait days just to buy a small fraction of a bitcoin. I took the price increases as little bonuses, but I didn't think of buying hundreds of bitcoins as an investment. The price doubled or crashed on a regular basis back then as well.
I'm sure that we'll get back to this in a year or two, the price will get a chance to stabilize eventually once everyone has had a chance to decide whether they want to own some bitcoins or not.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:11:36
Bitcoin has value because it's highly innovative and supported by a great network and many users who believe in it. Many new users are here solely for speculation, but they might see the light. Never before in history could someone carry any amount of money stealthily and completely securely on their person just by remembering 12 words. This is huge. It also allows people who don't have access to the banking system to join what amounts to a decentralized international bank. Bitcoin is a revolution. A four, five or six-figure value makes perfect sense when you consider the number of potential users and the maximum supply. 100M users worldwide (1 human in 75, which is totally reasonable) could only get 1/5th of a bitcoin each at best and that only represents $21,000 per user with a $10,000 bitcoin. This ignores companies that have much more cash than the average person and the fact that the supply is only 16M bitcoins minus the bitcoins that have already been lost forever.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:12:35
You invested your money in cheap altcoins. It is only natural that you would want them to replace bitcoin.
I happen to think that nearly all altcoins are propped up by the fact that they can be mined more easily than bitcoin.
The high fees and large mempool are a direct measure of bitcoin's success. Most cryptocurrencies would have a hard time handling a similar volume.
I am not blind to the fact that these are big issues, but I also know that they can be solved instantly by increasing the size of bitcoin's blocks. The developers want to try better scaling solutions first and they have my trust. Like them, I do not think that a coffee belongs on the blockchain because it uses too many resources.
I am betting on bitcoin's ecosystem. I like knowing that many extremely bright and competent developers are working hard to meet the challenges faced by bitcoin.

I don't care about your $1, when I say "lose everything", I'm talking about what you're about to spend because I was never under any illusion that you'd stop at $1.

I want organic growth, not greedy speculators with weak hands. People who care about bitcoin getting better as opposed to just more expensive. I got into bitcoin because it was the only currency in use at some outlets (wink wink) and stayed because it's an incredibly cool technology. I want to see bitcoin succeed as a store of value (one that I can carry in my memory by remembering my wallet's deterministic seed) and eventually as a currency once we get the Lightning Network. Steady adoption is preferable to the frenzy we saw last week.

Of course it's a dip. It just isn't a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:40:14
The price currently allows 100 million people (1 person in 75) to own 0.15 BTC each and store $2,500. This is absolutely nothing. Bitcoin is growing exponentially on all fronts except in terms of how many major vendors can accept it as a currency, but I explained why it isn't reasonable to expect it to work as a currency so early.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:39:04
You don't need to have BTC stored with every vendor. You will have BTC stored with a major intermediary and that intermediary will have BTC stored with all major vendors, allowing you to make transactions with every major company that works with the Lightning Network, which will be in their best interest. It works like a prepaid debit card.

I don't think that most people would want to bother for ~$20.
I'd give them, keep a copy of the wallet and get back to them one or two years later when it's worth much more to see if they ever bothered. If they lost their paper wallet, let them feel remorse about it and give them the copy of the paper wallet. This time around, I bet that they'll care.
Right now, giving a paper wallet worth $20 is like giving a gift card for a restaurant that offers really weird food. Most people would think that it's a shit gift, but their perspective might change in the future.
I put some BTC aside for my sister and friend recently. 50€ turned into 128€ and 100€ turned into 247€. They aren't going to know about it until I'm ready to tell them that I invested some money for them as a present and that it's now worth an amount that makes it impossible for them not to care.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:31:17
My family isn't like that. My parents are retired, own their house, have $200,000 in the bank and decent monthly pensions, enough to live comfortably. They actually gave $30,000 to my sister and I as an early inheritance, to minimize the amount of taxes we'll have to pay when they pass away. They wouldn't want me to give them too much money and would prefer that I help my sister. My grandmother is 81, owns her house and lives frugally. She wouldn't know what to do with more than $20,000. The only jealousy might come from uncles and aunts, but we aren't close and I wouldn't give them any money, regardless of how much I have. I would be able to live just as comfortably with $680,000 minus taxes than with $1M minus taxes.

Bitcoin will succeed or fail. If it succeeds, there will be many more users considering that the price got to where it is even though ~99% of the population in the developed world doesn't own any and most people haven't heard about it. If it fails, the price will eventually go to nothing. I don't claim to know where bitcoin is going, but I'd be really surprised if our world could put the cat back in the bag and ignore this innovation forever. ~$10,000 is more than likely a transitory price. Bitcoin's computational power, number of users and age make it by far the most likely cryptocurrency to succeed. It has my vote and my well wishes.

A wise decision that you might really come to regret. Bitcoin is in a class of its own. I don't think that the cat can be put back in the bag. I lived through many crashes and think that they're healthy as they inject a dose of realism into the minds on the newcomers. I say bring it on. I'm still almost doubling my money if the price falls by 90% and I'll be back with even more bitcoins and determination to wait for the inevitable recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:25:58
I don't even remember that bitcoin lost 40% of its value in a week at some point in 2016. We've had so many dips and crashes. We always recovered and we're recovering more and more quickly. Remember newcomers, if bitcoin dips, don't panic sell, that's the surest way to waste your money, just ask yourself whether or not the dip is a good opportunity to top off your capital to the nearest round bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:05:26
The price increased too quickly in the recent months and I welcome this correction, if only because it will reduce the frenzy and the stream of greedy people. We must focus on bitcoin's usability and future. It's true that there are plenty of butthurt people on the sidelines though, but we can't do much about them. We must prove them wrong by being reasonable and by working on making bitcoin better.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:59:12
It always went back up and higher, but people need to be more patient and get genuinely invested in bitcoin's future. Growth needs to be organic. Bitcoin must carve a niche for itself in the world of money. People getting in because of the recent hype is the last thing bitcoin needs, I just hope that there will be a steady stream of newcomers to make the recent influx of weak hands sustainable. It must attract people because of its merits, not of its rising price. We should focus on bitcoin's use cases and scalability above everything else.

This is obviously an attempt at minimizing your regret. Can't you enjoy your gains instead of spreading fear and uncertainty for no good reason? Your feeling-based prediction is worse than useless. Objectively, a $20,000 bitcoin makes just as much sense as a $1,000 bitcoin. There's no reasonable price, the price is just where an increasing demand meets an inelastic supply. I cashed out half my BCash and bought more bitcoins with the other half. Bitcoin hasn't even reached mainstream awareness yet, it's just the beginning.

To an extent, yes, the fees would be lower. The BCash and SegWit2X messes are partially to blame for the slow implementation of SegWit by major exchanges (mostly Coinbase) and wallet apps. If SegWit was the default option at exchanges and wallet apps, most people would be using it and bitcoin would be able to fit many more transactions per block, preventing backlog and unreasonable high fees.

I agree that no one should be mortgaging anything to get into bitcoin, but I would have given the same advice when I got in 5 years ago. You don't need anywhere close to a trillion dollars to get the price to $100,000 and stay there. I don't think that bitcoin has the potential to attract $1 trillion in the near future, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a $1 trillion market cap in the next couple of years. If bitcoin succeeds (and by that I mean as a secondary currency, not as a currency that replaces national currencies), having 100M people inject $10,000 each (or 1B people inject $1,000 each) over a decade isn't crazy when you take Wall Street-flavored money into account.

Look at the sustained growth of BTC after the fork, look at which cryptocurrency is the gold standard of cryptocurrencies, look at which cryptocurrency is in the news, look at which cryptocurrency is accepted the most, look at which cryptocurrency is working on scaling solutions, look at which cryptocurrency has by far the biggest network in terms of users and computational power, look at the size of this subreddit. SegWit2x was cancelled because of a clear lack of support and when they nevertheless attempted to fork, the fork failed. These aren't assumptions.
SegWit2x's code was a mess. The absence of replay protection was ridiculous. The New York Agreement crafted behind closed doors was incredibly shady.
Success mechanically leads to huge blocks. BCH can't scale in a decentralized manner in case of mass adoption. Anyone can participated in the bitcoin network right now. Someone's daily coffee doesn't have to pollute the blockchain and use the resources of thousands of computers when a much more elegant solution is available.

You can't take anyone's bitcoins if they're secured properly and you can't know how many bitcoins a person owns if they don't want anyone to know. Even if you tortured the owner, he could give you access to a dummy wallet and keep his actual wallet secret.
The price is increasing because people are buying more bitcoins than other people are willing to sell at the current price. A majority of people are keeping their bitcoins as opposed to wasting them, which wouldn't make sense. If this changed because of a catastrophic bug or bad news affecting the entire world, the price would plummet.
At the current price and with the current supply, 100 million owners can own 0.15 BTC each (less in practice because very early adopters and powerful investors own a non-negligible percentage of the supply and there's probably more than 1 million lost bitcoins), storing only ~$2,500 per person. If bitcoin keeps succeeding, we can expect more than 100 million users (1 human out of 75) and we can expect that the average user will want to store more than ~$2,500. Increase the number of users and/or the amount of money they want to store and the price will increase mechanically.
We agree on everything else.

No one can know that you have some bitcoins in your memory.
If someone knows that you own some bitcoins, tell them that the seed is stored in a bank vault. Plausible deniability. Most people don't memorize their seed anyway.

I've been buying and spending bitcoins since 2012 and never held any other cryptocurrency. I see alts as an opportunity to take other people's money through good trades and to make a lot of money by betting on the right horse, but that's where I draw the line when it comes to risk. I feel that ultimately, all the money will flow back into a single cryptocurrency and I believe that bitcoin will remain the gold standard of cryptocurrency.

We told them again and again not to panic and sell at a loss. We knew with near certainty that this wasn't the end of cryptocurrencies as they crashed for no valid reason. This selling frenzy was induced by unreasonable fear and compounded by panic.
The only people who lost money are the ones who sold during the crash and didn't get back in at a lower price. The same scenario has happened multiple times in 2017 and dozens of times since 2009. 
Why don't they trust seasoned owners and listen to other newcomers who repeat idiotic messages such as "this time it's different"?
In all likelihood, it's just going to take days, a couple of weeks at the most, certainly not months, for the price to rebound to where it was before the crash.

Of course, that's why we (I'm one of the creditors) are pushing for civil rehabilitation instead of bankruptcy. This could result in a distribution of the bitcoins (and the coins from the forks) directly to the creditors. The court will ultimately decide, but it doesn't look particularly good. If they reject our request and go ahead with the bankruptcy, they'll pay everyone in JPY, that's just how it works, they don't have a choice. Bitcoin is just like any other asset when it comes to Japanese bankruptcy law. In any case, even if they could distribute the remaining bitcoins, many would be sold immediately by the creditors.

This is ridiculous. Virtually every exchange keeps old funding addresses linked to a customer's account since what happened to you happens all the time. A fraction of the users will assume that an old funding address remains valid. They clearly lied when they gave you the first excuse, so there's no reason to trust them with their second excuse, which is completely unbelievable anyway. Nothing prevents the owner of the wallet from returning the funds. I bet that someone at this company is using this source of "mistakes" for personal gain. Does the wallet look like their main hot wallet or does it look like someone's personal wallet? I'd give them hell on Twitter and Facebook. Their first lie proves that they're scammers.

It's because Japanese law doesn't allow him to distribute cryptocurrencies, he must distribute that money in JPY.

I agree with you. It's sad to think that the first well-known bank that enters the market and offers to keep custody of their clients' bitcoins while also insuring them will likely make a killing. It completely goes again what bitcoin stands for, but most people in the West just trust them.

I really don't want to deal with these people and it seems like they're becoming increasingly more common. My father was so disgusted by the time and money it took to get rid of his tenant that he sold the property. My neighbor only works through Airbnb now.
I'd expect American law to be less lenient than French law, but still. Can you just post an eviction notice and call the police if the tenants don't leave?

Why wouldn't people conflate them? Markup is a hidden cost. A fee and a markup have the exact same implications unless sellers can pocket the markup when they sell.

If the Bitcoin Cash victims genuinely cared about Satoshi's vision for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, they wouldn't be planning on filling their blockchain with data from an on-chain social network. They rejected SegWit because it wasn't mentioned in the white paper even though it was a mere optimization designed to help with scaling, yet they now want to turn their contentious fork into a social network. It goes to show that their attachment to Satoshi's original vision was just posturing. Some of them got conned into repeating this hundreds of times. The real reasons why the people manipulating them opposed SegWit was because it hurt Bitmain's bottom line and it was yet another (failed) opportunity to try to wrestle bitcoin's development away from its competent developers.

He also knows how consensus works and isn't going to choose a contentious fork that only rallied 10% of the network.

Yes, the trustee already sold enough of them to pay us the equivalent in JPY of what we were owed on the day the bankruptcy was declared.
Most of us consider that less than $500 per bitcoin isn't fair and that MtGox owes us as much as they can pay to get us as close to possible as the current value of a bitcoin for every bitcoin we had. That would be around 20% of a bitcoin per bitcoin.
Unfortunately, the surplus is going to go to the shareholders if the court refuses to go from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation. Nearly all of the surplus would then go to Mark Karpeles, the CEO, who publicly stated that the money belongs to the creditors and that he doesn't deserve or want it. Hopefully, this will help convince the court since their foremost concern when granting a request of civil rehabilitation is that people who are owed money according to Japanese law don't get shafted.
I agree that the way Japanese law works in this case seems highly unethical considering that the men who let the theft happen through carelessness would become extremely rich off of our money. In my opinion, this case is so important that it would warrant getting the Japanese parliament to change the law to allow cryptocurrencies to be distributed to their real owners without requiring a conversion to the national currency. It would make perfect sense.
If we had all had rare paintings stored in a vault and the vault owner became bankrupt, it would sound insane to consider that the paintings were the property of the vault owner and to send them to auction against everyone's wishes.
The scariest thing is that the Japanese government stands to earn a fortune in taxes if the law is applied to the letter. If Mark Karpeles is awarded the equivalent of 1 billion dollars, he'll owe a large portion of that money to the Japanese tax authority.

If you have 100 BTC, you could send 1 BTC to an exchange and have the exchange send 1 BTC to a new wallet. The exchange and the authorities are the only entities that could connect the 1 BTC to your 100 BTC.
If you want to be extra cautious, you could send multiple transactions totaling approximately 1 BTC to an exchange, buy a privacy coin with the funds, send the privacy coin to a wallet you control, send it to a different exchange, convert it back into 1 BTC and send the funds to two (or more) new wallets. Send 0.4 BTC to one of the wallets and 0.6 BTC to the other one. From there, no one would be able to tell that the person making transactions from these two wallets owns 100 BTC.

His email client could feature a button to add the sender to his whitelist and a button to refund the 0.005 BTC.
This would decrease the volume and improve the quality of the messages he receives significantly.
When you write the email address of the recipient, it could send a query to a database that would return the recipient's name (to check that you're contacting the correct person) and his/her fee.

This sounds like a ridiculous conspiracy theory. While you say this, other conspiracy theories suggest that the prices of gold and silver are being kept low artificially.
Why would the government promote gold? It's mainly interested in maintaining the hegemony of the dollar which stopped being backed by gold decades ago.
Many central banks have been increasing their gold reserves in recent years.
Gold is relevant as a hedge against financial calamities. Enough parties find it useful that it has remained relevant for thousands of years, even if it isn't used as a currency anymore.
I see gold and bitcoin as complementary. One is stability and low risk incarnate, with the promise of being protected from financial calamities. The other is volatility and high risk incarnate, with the promise of a great reward.
Bitcoin has many properties that outshine gold while gold has properties that bitcoin will never be able to replicate.
Bitcoin needs to be distributed more fairly and for its price to get more stable before it can be thought of as an equivalent to gold. At the moment, they're merely converging slowly as bitcoin is increasingly capable of storing value.
I think that bitcoin users and gold bugs should be kind to each other. Their commodities of choice can compliment one another. I started buying gold in 2011 and bitcoin in 2012. The stability of my gold felt quite reassuring during bitcoin's crashes and bitcoin's rallies felt great when gold was struggling to keep up with inflation.

I was contrarian in 2011 and 2012 when I started having disposable income and put everything in precious metals, bitcoin and historical artifacts, missing out on years of insane growth on the stock market. In the end, my bitcoin did great, my precious metals barely kept up with inflation and my historical artifacts did alright. I'm not too keen on buying high and selling low for my first dance with the stock market, so I'm going to wait for the next recession, even if it takes a couple more years. I just wish I could do something productive with the 35,000€ as its purchasing power is decreasing. I even thought of buying a small excavator and digging holes for people since I have so much free time and since there's a lack of contractors available to do this type of work in my area.

@_date: 2019-08-19 06:56:40
Apart from the cash, I'm at 10.65% gold, 3.7% silver, 28.16% art, antiques and antiquities, 33.50% crypto, 23.99% real-estate, 0% stock market. It drives my financial adviser at my bank nuts. I spend so little that he called me to ask if I had bank accounts at another bank recently. It sucks to have missed out on years of stock market growth, but it scares me somewhat and I have a strong aversion for the financial world, probably because I spend too much time on Reddit. Good on you for being able to take advantage of that growth. Gold getting more expensive feels nice, but the gold and silver markets were such shit shows after the peaks of 2012 that I almost feel like I'm owed that money for holding tight. ;) Hopefully, it's only the beginning. I think that I'm going to follow your advice and keep that money as an emergency fund and to be able to jump on potential opportunities in the next couple of years. Thanks!

Yes, but when your goal is to transport value discreetly, volume is more important than weight. It would be much harder to hide $1M in $100 bills on your body than $1M in gold which would fit in 3 and a half cans of Coke. I agree that Bitcoin is the absolute best way to transport value discreetly though. The fact that you can transport an unlimited amount of value in your memory securely by remembering a sequence of 12 words blows my mind.

I don't want to buy more BTC, I don't want to buy more precious metals, I don't want to invest it in the stock market now that I expect a recession and it isn't enough to invest in the housing market.

You may not need to, but plenty of people have to move (sometimes over dangerous territory, sometimes over borders) with everything they own.
With bitcoin, no one knows that you're carrying money on your person. Your money is 100% invisible and 100% safe. You could be dropped naked in any major city in the world and be fine.
Your second sentence is silly. People like you said this 10 years ago already when bitcoin was worth a fraction of what it's worth today. Using a blockchain to store and transfer value without having to trust anyone or obtain their permission is a major innovation. The cat isn't going back into the bag. You're suffering from a failure of the imagination.
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:16:01
Yeah, this submission and some of these comments are silly. A sudden 5% move up after a small crash in a bull market is something that happened so many times over the past decade that it's barely worth mentioning. It's just bitcoin doing its thing.
We get to giggle because people who tried shorting it took a nut shot and nut shots are never not funny, but claiming that anyone missed their chance is ridiculous. Bitcoin could be at $8,000 or $12,000 in a month or two and it still wouldn't say anything about its future.
We should just be content that the sentiment around bitcoin is generally positive (at least compared to what it was years ago) and that the trauma of the bubble popping is healing relatively well.
We're at a stage where laypeople are starting to accept the idea that bitcoin is here to stay and continue growing and that's something worth rejoicing over. A 5% jump after a 20% drop isn't.

Don't be silly. I spent over 100 bitcoins on goods and services. Buying other cryptocurrencies isn't exactly using bitcoin as a currency. He asked if he should divest in an another cryptocurrency because he wasn't comfortable with today's fluctuations and I told him that he shouldn't, not that he should never spend his bitcoins. Moreover, bitcoin doesn't have to be used as a currency to succeed. Bitcoin is what the users make of it. It's been going strong for 9 years now. When the Lightning Network finally gets implemented, we'll have near instantaneous transactions for extremely low fees. However, as long as bitcoin is unstable, bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case and we can't expect bitcoin to have a stable price while we're in the adoption and price discovery phases.

It's completely unreasonable to expect the price of bitcoin to be stable when it's barely entering the mass adoption phase. The supply is fairly steady and the demand is growing. A price increase is purely mechanical and unavoidable. This is a period of price discovery and it will last until everyone has had a chance to decide whether they want some bitcoins or not. It will be a currency eventually with the Lightning Network, but right now bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:31:37
There has been one true bubble in the history of bitcoin and that was in 2013 when the price soared past $1000 because of manipulation by the owner of Mt.Gox. Bitcoin lost most of its value when this bubble popped. It was such a trauma that the price took a couple of years to recover. Bitcoin is much more healthy now that there are many exchanges all around the globe.
There have been crashes on a fairly regular basis, typically because of scary news. These crashes have done a decent job at showing that the price is grounded in reality. Every single recent crash has been resorbed quickly because investors believe in the utility and potential of the technology enough to keep their bitcoins and because the influx of new investors continues to grow. The technology is innovative and objectively good. The rising price has put bitcoin on the radar of regular people. The Internet saw the same type of growth when it started becoming mainstream as opposed to just a den for nerds in the early 2000s.
Bitcoin isn't splitting in two. The original bitcoin will continue to account for nearly all the capital. An alternative cryptocurrency based on bitcoin will be created and most likely fail. A group is trying to hijack the development of bitcoin from the developers that are trusted by a majority of users. Bitcoin can easily weather attacks like these and has done so in the past. The only drawback is that it's a bit technical and that investors will have to be cautious about who they trust for a little while.
If this attack fails, it's unlikely that there will be other attacks of this magnitude in the future. If the attack unexpectedly succeeds, investors who haven't taken a stand won't be losing their capital since their bitcoins will exist in both cryptocurrencies. Investors who take a stand by selling their bitcoins from the cryptocurrency they don't believe in while keeping their bitcoins from the cryptocurrency they believe in will even have an opportunity to earn some free money like they did with BCH (bitcoin cash).

Alright. It would be significantly more expensive than $50 in many countries since you'd have to pay import duties on top of the cost to ship and insure the gold.

I agree with you, although I think that bitcoin will remain very special. The Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to scale beautifully. Many other cryptocurrencies aren't equipped for that and they can't rely on nearly as much computational power. If other cryptocurrencies become highly successful (Ethereum already is to an extant), I believe that they'll simply coexist with bitcoin which will remain the gold standard of cryptocurrencies.
It's true that it's very scary how so many people don't know what they're doing and are just in because of the hype that happened in 2017. A couple of days ago, I replied to someone who asked how they could transfer their bitcoins from an exchange to another exchange. Everyone should know how to make a transaction securely, what to avoid and how to keep their bitcoins safe before buying. Today's dip proved that many people are ill prepared to be on this market.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:24:47
There are plenty of great reasons to use bitcoin. Like the ability to carry any amount of money in your head securely by memorizing 12 words. Right now, transferring large amounts of money is relatively cheap with bitcoin, you can send $1M for $5, but it's true that fees affect small transactions disproportionately.
SegWit will soon take care of high fees and the Lightning Network will essentially make the transfer of small amounts free. The only issue right now is that exchanges and wallet apps are slow to implement SegWit, but it will happen in the coming months.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:10:57
Yes, it would be a $1500 profit, the fees are negligible. You can make some money trading like this, but sooner or later (and usually sooner than later), bitcoin is going to do something unexpected and you won't be able to buy your bitcoins back for a price you consider affordable. It's unwise to think that you can time the market.

Some people believe that commodities (gold, silver, grain, oil...) follow predictable cycles of price growth that are inversely correlated with stock markets. This person claims that we're at a point in the cycle where commodities are about to jump in value. He considers that bitcoin is a commodity and that it's about to grow in value along with the rest of the commodities.
I'm not as confident that we're at the point where commodities are about to jump in value. I'd love it since I'm barely breaking even on the precious metals I bought between 2012 and 2016, but stock markets are doing really good. I think that it would take a financial crisis (student debt?) or a war to hurt the stock markets.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:25:07
That's a criminally retarded statement. I'd love to see that chain of comments. To be fair though, stock exchanges often halt trading when something terrible happens or when a specific stock drops in value beyond a certain point. Panic is never good.

I'm not convinced that there will be a crash after the fork. Plenty of people will want to buy more bitcoins with their free Segwit2x tokens and plenty of people are waiting for a dip. I doubt that a massive number of people bought bitcoins thinking that they'd just sell them after the fork. If they invested, they might as well keep their money in bitcoin since it has been doing so well this year. We'll see.

Do people still use Armory?
I almost couldn't sell a third of my BCH (Bitcoin Cash) because the corresponding bitcoins were stuck in an Armory paper wallet from 2014. With Armory, you need to download the entire blockchain to be able to decipher your seed and access your private keys, which is something I can't do. Wallets have really come a long way in the last few years. Thankfully, I found my private keys in plain text in an old encrypted container. My 2014 self had exported them in spite of the danger.
I hope that Segwit2x will offer the same opportunity as Bitcoin Cash, but I'm afraid that the price will tank immediately and stay very low. And if the price doesn't tank, I'll probably be too scared to sell my tokens even though I don't believe in Segwit2x.

The Silk Road being shut down made my father sell his 21 bitcoins for 2000€ (exactly what he had paid for them) and he's still regretting his decision.

Greedy newcomers are the only ones panicking and selling at a loss. We've seen so many movements like these. This was an opportunity for the people who complained that the price was too high at $10,000 and who said that they were waiting for the dip. Panic is your worst enemy when it comes to bitcoin. There have been no negative news, it's just someone who sold a lot and who frightened the weaker hands, there's no reason for bitcoin to drop in value, so the price will rebound super quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:34:47
Open a free account on Coinbase, make your first purchase. It's super easy. When you have $500 worth of BTC, install a wallet like Bread or Mycelium on your phone, write down the recovery seed (12 words that let you recover your bitcoins if your phone gets stolen or explodes) and transfer your bitcoins from Coinbase to your wallet so that you control them. Everything is super easy.

No, because you can't really cut your gold coin into smaller units practically (the Vikings did) since the act of cutting it into pieces will destroy a good fraction of its value, but you can with bitcoin. Also, bitcoin is accepted by more vendors than gold coins are.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:07:27
Most of the value of bitcoin comes from the fact that it has brand recognition, the prestige of being the first cryptocurrency, a very strong network, is used as the gold standard to evaluate the value of the other cryptocurrencies. BCH has none of that, but it's attempting to co-opt it aggressively and that's an issue. The poster boys of BCH are shady, self-serving people that don't deserve anyone's trust anymore after all the pain they've caused to so many people.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:58:57
It isn't about dethroning, it's about trying to steal bitcoin's brand. Much of the value of bitcoin is tied to its brand. That's the attack and people's savings are at stake. I don't think that BCH will succeed, but they're a thorn in bitcoin's foot and they erode confidence in cryptocurrencies, all because of the greediness of a few power-hungry and self-serving people.

People have been saying that it was too late to get in since the price was $10. Bitcoin always felt too expensive, even at 4.5€ when I bought my first ones.

The fact that exchanges need to cooperate with taxation authorities isn't a surprise. Virtually all major exchanges that survived after the early years comply with anti-money laundering rules. It's the reason why they have limits and require you to show them your ID. The market takes this into account. We've always known that private transactions using cash are the only way to remain anonymous and avoid the tax man. I wouldn't want to risk my money by not paying my taxes on capital gains.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:42:21
It's meaningless in the sense that only a small fraction of bitcoins are worth ~$10,000. It doesn't make sense to multiply the total supply by the current price because selling a large percentage of all existing bitcoins would result in a massive price crash. Market cap is a good indicator for companies that have reasonably priced stocks. There is no asset or revenue stream behind bitcoin. For bitcoin, the market cap is just useful to measure its relative importance compared to other cryptocurrencies.

It's a damn coffee. Your daily coffee doesn't need to clog the blockchain up and make it more and more difficult to download and maintain for the average person.

If the transaction is instantaneous and cheaper than with any other cryptocurrency, is that not satisfactory enough?

There are plenty of good reasons to buy bitcoin. Billions of people don't have access to a bank account. Plenty of people want to send money abroad easily, cheaply and/or discreetly. There's plenty of value in a currency that can't be messed with by governments or banks (though inflation, seizures, restrictions, etc...). The money in my bank accounts is insured to a limit of 100,000€. That's way too low for plenty of people. Banks lend so much money they don't have that a major economic crisis or a bank run could kill some of them easily. You haven't thought this through.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:50:46
I specifically wrote that you don't have to buy at the absolute bottom since it's indeed impossible to know when the price has reached its lowest point. Buying during the dip is good enough.
Predictions based on past performances are dangerous, yes, but the market tends to react to certain types of news and price movements in predictable manners. It would be silly to ignore these patterns entirely.
Similarly, you don't have to sell at the absolute highest point, you can ride a rally and sell when you're satisfied with your gains or right after the price starts decreasing.

Greed made them see BCH as an opportunity to travel back in time and become one of the people who saw their capital being multiplied by 1,000 or more. What truly puzzles me is how they could ignore the fact that BTC is the undisputed gold standard of cryptocurrencies and orders of magnitude bigger than all the other cryptocurrencies. I think that many BCH advocates suffer from the same type of mentality that is prevalent in conspiracy theorists. They ignore reality if it clashes with their preferred narrative. Even if I believed in BCH, I would never have liquidated all of my BTC when you consider how relevant it is and how easily BTC could render BCH pointless if we chose to increase the block size.

Great job selling at that time. People thought that the price would keep increasing then.

Exchanges have internal databases in order to avoid paying transaction fees for every operation and because it's much faster and convenient, so these transactions can't be counted in the total. A transaction is only counted when it's recorded on the blockchain and for this to happen, the buyer has to transfer the bitcoins he/she purchased into his/her own wallet. Traders tend to keep their money on the exchange though, unless they do some arbitrage between exchanges.

They don't remember the past because they weren't there to witness the previous dips. I can see why someone would think that a 20% drop that happens within minutes is scary as hell.

Dips are a regular occurrence and an opportunity for newcomers to buy discounted bitcoins.

The growth spikes in 2013 and 2014 are really interesting. They look quite unnatural. Did something catch the attention of people who weren't into bitcoin on these days?

History is full of examples of better products failing because inferior products managed to capture and retain the majority of users. It's the norm actually. That's why I deal almost exclusively in bitcoin. Bitcoin has the value it has because it's in adoption phase and a huge number of users are entering the market. A four or five figure bitcoin makes perfect sense at this point with only a few millions of moving bitcoins for so much new capital. If adoption keeps increasing, a bitcoin will be worth much more and it still won't be a bubble. Some alts are better when it comes to speed, fees or anonymity, but for everything else, bitcoin is far superior and the protocol is constantly evolving. SegWit and Lightning Network will eventually take care of speed and fees, but we sadly have to deal with a slow implementation. The fact that you can make more money by betting on emerging cryptocurrencies isn't the surprising since they start from zero, but that doesn't mean anything about their value or long-term chances. A 9 year-old bitcoin tells investors who want to park their money that the technology has proven itself to be reliable and has a good chance (or rather a better chance than others) of holding on for the coming decade. Cryptocurrencies that haven't tested nearly as extensively and don't benefit from such a secure network are much more dangerous.

It has a bunch of great use cases. Here are the 3 use cases I like the most:
- Bitcoin has proved to be a good store of value. Past trends don't predict future performance, but so far, every single person who bought bitcoins between in the past 9 years has protected his/her capital. The fact that they've been handsomely rewarded for it is just a side effect of bitcoin's growth as it transitions from confidential to mainstream very slowly.
- Bitcoin protects people from the consequences of a failing currency in countries like Zimbabwe or Venezuela. The people in these countries are theoretically forced to use their failing national currencies. Many of them have started using bitcoin and their government can't do much about it.
- You can keep any amount of money in your head without anyone's knowledge by remembering 12 words and no one can steal or confiscate that money from you. This is a huge innovation.

BCH's goal to take over bitcoin and all the division and uncertainty it creates is so bad for bitcoin. I don't want anyone to lose their capital, but at this point I'd love it if bitcoin temporarily increased the block size while we wait for SegWit to be implemented by all exchanges and wallet apps and offered as a default option, just to make BCH completely irrelevant.

When the price increases by 20%, your capital increases by 20%. How much you own doesn't matter. In October, I bought 50€ worth of bitcoin as a present for my friend and 100€ for my sister. The 50€ turned into 114€ and the 100€ turned into 219€ already. I bought my first bitcoins at 4.5€ each in 2012 and I thought that I was overpaying. Bitcoin always feels expensive and you always feel like you're too late, but people who buy now are still early adopters.

It's dealt as a bankruptcy. A trustee was appointed years ago and over 20,000 claimants had their claims accepted. People who didn't submit their claims are out of luck now. The trustee controls 200,000 bitcoins and that's enough to cover everyone's losses valued in Japanese currency at the time of the bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this means that claimants will receive a little over $400 per bitcoin instead of the current price because that's how bankruptcy proceedings work in Japan.

Bitcoin is in a league of its own. Its network is tremendously larger than any other cryptocurrency. It has much more vendors willing to accept it than any other cryptocurrency. Its brand is very powerful. Most people don't know what a bitcoin is, but infinitely more people know about bitcoin than about the second biggest cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to scale beautifully. Even microtransactions will be virtually instantaneous and almost free. Most cryptocurrencies aren't ready for mainstream usage, bitcoin is actively working on it. This will create an entirely new industry.

I agree, a little under 3% is too high. Coinbase is shitty in that regard since you could easily have this transaction go through for half that fee. If I were you, I'd leave the BTC on Coinbase since it's a relatively small amount while we wait for them and others to implement SegWit. The fee will be a tiny fraction of what they're asking now.

It isn't reasonable to expect the price to be stable when the mass adoption phase has barely started. We have to go through a period of price discovery. The price will stabilize after everyone has had a chance to decide whether they want some bitcoins or not. Right now, most people still don't know what a bitcoin is. You can use your bitcoins as a pseudonymous currency if you buy them right before you make your purchase, but most people would agree that bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case at the moment.

I think that someone sold a large amount of bitcoins, the price dropped slightly, newcomers started panicking, automatic sell orders kicked in, some exchanges went down, the panic got insane, then everyone realized that they were being silly. Hopefully, not too many people lost money. A dip that isn't accompanied by terrible news will always rebound quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:52:36
There's nothing foolish about buying at $9400, but it's foolish to buy without knowing what bitcoin is. This is a dip and dips have been happening on a regular basis for the past 9 years. There's nothing to worry about. In a little while, you'll be proud to belong to the club of people who bought four-figure bitcoins. The only people who lost money in the past 9 years are those who panicked and sold at a loss. Absolutely everyone else has seen the value of their capital rise.
Bitcoin is a list of transactions shared on a very large network of computers. Your bitcoins are attached to a private cryptographic key which allows you to send said bitcoins to a bitcoin address. The bitcoin network, a decentralized network anyone can participate in, uses a large amount of computational power to verify the validity of transactions and mine new bitcoins by solving a difficult cryptographic problem. There are over 16M bitcoins in existence today and miners will keep creating new bitcoins at a decreasing rate until the theoretical limit of 21M bitcoins is reached.

The market cap of precious metals isn't very useful either since most of the metal that sleeps in vaults was purchased for a fraction of its current price. In this case, the market cap isn't an accurate representation of how much capital is stored in the asset in question.
The market cap of stocks is a different animal. It's fairly common for companies to absorb another company through the purchase of over 50% of its shares or through an exchange of stocks. Stocks are supposed to reflect the value of a company.
I still look at the market cap for commodities. It's the only way to compare gold and bitcoin for instance.

SegWit2x was truly awful. Most users rejected it because it was coded horribly, it was a contentious hard fork and an attempt to wrestle the development away from very competent and responsible programmers. The NYA was so shady. We have SegWit and it's perfectly capable of taking care of network congestion and high fees while we wait for Lightning. The only issue is that exchanges and wallet apps aren't implementing it quickly enough.

I disagree. Cost averaging is great for large investments in precious metals. With bitcoin, you're better off accumulating your dollars for a few weeks (or months if the price is going sideways) and buying when there's a dip. Dips are frequent enough. You don't have to buy at the absolute bottom to get a great deal. If the price is going up consistently and you're afraid of missing out, you can buy at your earliest convenience, but waiting for the next dip is usually preferable. When you have a decent amount of BTC at the exchange, wait for a period of low transaction fees and transfer your BTC to your wallet. A single well-timed transaction is much better than lots of little transactions. Don't let fees chip away at your capital, they add up quickly and amount to a lot of wasted money when your investment has doubled in value a few times.

It's a very reasonable assumption considering that the vast majority of people still don't know what bitcoin is.

It won't stay that way thanks to beautiful scaling solutions like SegWit (already implemented) and the Lighting Network (in the works). Right now, bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case, but it will change in the coming months. Even microtransactions will become near instantaneous and practically free.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:26:19
We indeed can't differentiate between transactions for goods and services and transactions to exchange bitcoins. The total volume transacted outside of internal transactions at exchanges in the past 24 hours is in excess of 12 billion dollars. Bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case currently, but this will change once the Lightning Network is implemented, allowing for near instantaneous and extremely cheap transactions. I think the biggest use case currently is an international store of value that's impossible to confiscate or steal if the necessary precautions are taken and that can be carried everywhere with you simply by remembering 12 words. That's incredibly innovative. I hope that it will become a practical currency as soon as possible, but we can't expect a stable price while we're in the adoption phase and while the price is being discovered.

BTC has a marketing problem when it comes to scaling. Everyone should know that SegWit is here already and we should call out exchanges and wallet apps for not implementing it quickly enough. That's the only reason why adoption is low. With SegWit used by default at all exchanges and wallet apps, we would have a perfectly good temporary scaling solution while we wait for the Lightning Network.

You open a free account at an exchange (Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken, Bitstamp...), submit a picture of your ID to get your account verified, transfer money from your bank account to the exchange, convert the dollars into bitcoins and voilà! Coinbase allows you to buy bitcoins directly with a credit card. Once your bitcoins are in your account at the exchange and if it's a sizable amount, install a wallet app (Bread, Mycelium...) on your phone, write the seed (12 or more words that let you recover your bitcoins if your phone is stolen or explodes) down on a piece of paper and transfer your bitcoins from the exchange into your wallet app. This way, you control your bitcoins and you can't lose them if the exchange gets shut down or hacked. The entire process is very easy!
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:08:31
Of course it was our money and that's why the trustee accepted our claims. You can't hold the private keys for your $ or €. We didn't do anything wrong, the hackers and Karpeles are the only ones who deserve to be blamed. I didn't store my bitcoins on Mt.Gox, they were there because I was exchanging them for €.
It was also much easier to lose your bitcoins then than today. Deterministic mobile wallets make it very easy for new users to secure their bitcoins now.
Not having your bitcoins on exchanges is great advice and always has been, but more often than not, you can't avoid it unless you buy and sell exclusively through LocalBitcoins.
Mt.Gox was the biggest exchange by far, it was making millions in theory and most people didn't think that Karpeles would risk losing it all through incompetence and negligence. Roger Ver was a trusted name back then and most people thought that he had done his due diligence when he published the video in which he told us that Mt.Gox was perfectly fine.
If Karpeles gets a surplus, he better do the right thing and distribute it to the creditors. Some people have killed themselves because of this fiasco. Plenty of people wouldn't have lost anything if he hadn't tried to cover up his mistakes.

I don't think that this narrative holds much water. In my opinion, the recent push happened because of a combination of organic growth (helped by the free Bitcoin Cash tokens) and a massive amount of fear of missing out after most press outlets published articles about bitcoin when the price hit $5,000. I'm fairly confident that most of the money that was put into bitcoin won't go anywhere and that new investors will absorb the dips. After all, the price weathered the news that China was closing its exchanges. Not getting Segwit2x tokens is infinitely less serious, especially since there was never much hope that the Segwit2x tokens would be worth much. I bet that we won't see a &gt;$1,000 price decrease before $10,000.

Had you sent those BTC via SegWit, it would have been quite a bit cheaper. The only problem is that exchanges and wallet apps are slow to implement SegWit, but if you're willing to use another wallet app in the meantime, you can use SegWit.
With the Lightning Network, paying for your coffee will be instantaneous and almost free. Hence why bitcoin is a work in progress. The developers have come up with a beautiful scaling method. A much better one than allowing huge blocks that will assuredly lead to centralization and a network that is much more at risk.

You can sell them privately for a bank transfer or cash or you can sell them on one of many exchanges. To do this, you create a free account at an exchange of your choice, show them your ID, link your bank account, send your bitcoins in, click "sell", receive the money a few seconds later and request a transfer to your bank account. It's super easy.

It's impossible to list everything. You can get a debit card that lets you buy anything (including money from ATMs) with your bitcoin balance.

There are plenty of interesting news to talk about. Also, if we showed that we're serious about SegWit and the Lightning Network, they might be implemented more quickly. Right now, most of the new users don't even know what SegWit and the Lightning Network are. They don't know that a great scaling solution is in the works and it gives ammo to the proponents of BCH. We need to talk about this much more than we do now. It's unforgivable that most exchanges and wallet apps still haven't implemented SegWit nearly 4 months after its launch.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:25:14
I can't wait until most exchanges and wallets offer SegWit by default. It's going to do so much for usability and nullify the majority of the claims made against BTC by the proponents of BCH. The recent mess could have been avoided entirely if the developers had introduced SegWit more quickly, but I know that sensitive changes take time to implement.

You can see who they are on [this page]( The inventor of bitcoin handed the reigns to Gavin Andresen who later handed them to Wladimir van der Laan. Anyone can contribute by suggesting code. If the team's work is good — and Bitcoin Core's work has a great track record — it's chosen by the community. Other teams created software that failed to catch on.
The free cryptocurrency units are created when the fork happens. Every bitcoin you had before the fork now exists simultaneously in the old and new cryptocurrencies. From then on, what you do with your bitcoins doesn't affect the units in the new cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is an example of a cryptocurrency that was created by forking bitcoin. When exchanges started trading BCH, many people decided to sell their BCH since they didn't believe in the potential of this cryptocurrency. There are enough people who believe in the future of BCH and who are willing to buy some that it gives value to the cryptocurrency. I sold two thirds of my BCH yesterday for approximately 550€ a pop.

I meant what I said, I wasn't talking about payment channels since the Lightning Network isn't operational. SegWit makes the footprint of a transaction smaller and allows more transactions per block, thus reducing congestion and fees. I'd like people to make SegWit transactions and if they did, the fees would come down. Is saying "sending BTC via SegWit" wrong now that you know exactly what I meant?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:14
I agree with you and I spent over 100 bitcoins on goods and services, although as I wrote in an earlier comment, you can't expect the price to be stable while the public discovers bitcoin since the supply is so inelastic. It will stabilize eventually and the Lightning Network will make it even better as a currency. We can't predict a crash. For all we know, the speculators will like bitcoin when they'll be able to use it as a currency and in all likelihood, people will convert their bitcoins into national currencies at different times and progressively for fear of missing out on potential future rallies.

Thank you very much for researching this. I was directly impacted by every single one of these events, but I didn't remember when exactly they happened.

I don't think that we're in for a massive (&gt;25%) price correction unless a large country comes up with an extremely restrictive law, but we'll see. The price increased scarily fast in recent months, but people's hands might be much steadier now that they've seen countless examples of rebounds and that it's been shown that in 9 years, the only people who lost money are the ones who panicked.

Why the hell are you investing in bitcoin when you don't even know how to do a simple transaction? This is a recipe for losing your bitcoins.

He asked if there's a better cryptocurrency than bitcoin right now. This was just a small dip, we're used to them and it doesn't require any action. Bitcoin has tremendously more computational power securing the network than any other cryptocurrency. No one is claiming to know if bitcoin will still be the gold standard of cryptocurrencies in 20 years, but right now it's in a league of its own and the other cryptocurrencies are tied to what happens to bitcoin. Bitcoin has also been much more peer reviewed and tested than any other cryptocurrency and it has been working for 9 years. If another cryptocurrency replaces bitcoin at the helm, it won't happen overnight. Cryptocurrencies can coexist without any issue.

At $100,000 per BTC, if 100M people (1/75th of the world population) own BTC, they could own 0.21 BTC each at best and this would be worth $21,000. These figures are all very reasonable.
In truth, there would be fewer BTC available since there are only 16M BTC in circulation right now (with many of them lost forever) and a good portion of the BTC would be hoarded by whales (pension funds, early adopters...).

Which is something Bitcoin can do at any time if they decide to take a less conservative approach to give breathing room to the network. It would render Bitcoin Cash obsolete overnight.
SegWit was their opportunity to try to take control of Bitcoin's development forcibly. Not having implemented SegWit doesn't differentiate Bitcoin Cash enough to justify its existence (and super shoddy network) as time showed that their fearmongering about SegWit was unjustified.

You're in a subreddit that devotes a lot of its attention to technology that allows people to store their money and spend it using a phone.  
Thinking that a phone can replace your keys isn't more unreasonable than thinking that a phone can replace your wallet.  
Physical keys have plenty of disadvantages, they can be bulky, they can rattle, they don't feel good in your pocket, they can scratch your phone, they take more time to use than an automatic lock, you can't let someone in if they don't have the physical key, even a picture will allow you to copy them, the lock can be picked, you have to call a locksmith if you lose them and even if you have a backup key, it's a security risk to not change the lock when you lose one. In fact, I think that the industry is ripe for a better solution.  
A cryptographic key (ideally time-based for increased security) on a programmable RFID chip in your phone would have plenty of advantages and none of the disadvantages I just listed. Quicker entry, nothing to carry that you don't carry already, secured by cryptography, you can set up as many keys as you want, you can revoke someone's access easily if you change the passphrase, any compatible phone or smartwatch can become a key (even temporarily) as long as you memorize the passphrase.  
In terms of disadvantages, it's more expensive than a key, it might be too complicated to set up for some people and it won't work if there's a power outage, although a solar panel with a battery would fix this. If you can think of any other disadvantage, I'm all ears.  
Some modern cars already have similar systems. It's going to happen. You're talking like a luddite.

It's difficult to come up with a reasonable percentage. There are so many factors to take into account.
In my case, cryptocurrencies represent approximately a fourth of my assets, which is too much, but that's because I started buying in 2012, because I expect a recession, because I believe in crypto and because I don't have to worry about my pension.
At this point in time, I think that people should have at least 15% divided between precious metals and cryptocurrencies.

Having 1 BTC is nice, but as soon as you spend some of it, you're out of the club. He should move that 1 BTC to a nice vanity address on a cool date (like 1/3/2020 to celebrate the blockchain's birthday or on his own birthday) and hodl it there for street cred and the ladies. At $1,000,000 per BTC, that would be pretty baller.
I'd memorize the seed words and carry that 1 BTC in my memory forever. Knowing that you can land in any airport in the world with nothing but the shirt on your back and be alright is pretty cool.
Of course, 21 BTC would sound even nicer, but we don't live in that world anymore, it isn't a reasonable target anymore for most people.
He should then start buying the BTC he'll use for daily purchases and keep it in a few separate wallets.

Most people think that they paid too much for their bitcoins when they buy them.

I don't think that your prediction will pan out.

Every press outlet has published something about bitcoin recently. There was even an article about it in my local newspaper in France when bitcoin hit $5,000. The massive influx of capital comes from newcomers (people and companies) and most newcomers are here to stay. If a dip happens, I bet that it will be because of all the people who predicted a sell-off after the fork. Weak hands who have never seen a dip and who treat bitcoin the way they treat stocks might lose some money.

Your phone is protected by your fingerprint. Losing it would be less of a problem than losing your keys.
Even if you lost everything, you would be able go to any store and buy a device (or borrow someone else's) that lets you open your front door or make a transaction simply by entering your cryptographic passphrase into said device.
If you're worried about security, we could have a secure mode on the phone for sensitive applications such as keys or payments.
The phone could boot into a secondary OS that would check that its code hasn't been altered and that can only run one app (dowloaded from a highly secure walled garden) at a time.

It never happens to me and I expect that it will happen less and less with better batteries, but it could be solved easily.  
A programmable RFID chip in the phone could be used as a key even when the phone is dead.  
The phone could also put itself in a low power consumption mode when there's only 5% of battery left. This mode could keep sensitive functions such as keys and payments working for an extra 24 hours after the phone dies.  
You could also have a secondary device such as a watch to do it if your phone dies.

My retired father repaired copy machines during his entire career while my mother worked in the same small grocery store for most of her life and is a nanny now that she's nearing retirement. As middle class as it gets, yet they always had more than enough saved to avoid having to finance a car. They always lived comfortably, travel, own a cinder-block house that's too big for them and still have enough saved to buy a small house if they wanted to. They always bought modest and reliable cars that they kept for many years. Like the Dutch guy higher in the thread who never heard of anyone around him financing a car, we're European (French). Might it be that Europeans are more inclined to save money? I'm 33 and never had a credit card.

You don't need to look for an exchange that has an app though. Most wallet apps (Mycelium, Green Address, Jaxx, Coinomi, Bread) let you sweep the private key from a paper wallet. At this point, you simply make a transaction from your wallet app by sending the BTC that's in it to the funding address that Coinsquare gives you.
If the paper wallet is old, it might have been created with an app that isn't compatible with modern apps. This happened to me with an old Armory paper wallet. In this case, the simplest way to recover the private key is to install the original software.

Users agree to submit to Know Your Customer obligations because they're more comfortable dealing with a large exchange than going through a service like LocalBitcoins.com. I wouldn't want to have to meet with someone to buy thousands of euros worth of bitcoin in cash. If your aim is to bypass your local tax authority, go ahead and buy and sell your cryptocurrencies in person for cash. You have the option. This isn't high priority for most current owners. If you want bitcoin to get adopted, you can't expect it to only be used by cypherpunks and libertarians. Bitcoin wouldn't be where it is yet without the exchanges. Decentralized exchanges are the next logical step, but getting national currencies in and out will always largely involve centralized agents that are bound by law.

There are a few good reasons to use PayPal:
- No need to fetch my credit card when I order something online.
- No need to give my credit card information to a third party.
- No need to bother with my bank's two-factor authentication.
- Overall, it's quicker than using my credit card because it involves fewer steps and I already know which buttons to press.
- I can order from websites I don't necessarily trust, because I know that I'll be reimbursed if the item doesn't show up.
- It provides me with a cart system and a payment processor for my website with no monthly fees.
- It allows me to hold balances in multiple currencies. My bank doesn't.
- It makes international transactions outside of SEPA easy.
Of course, cryptocurrencies do nearly all of this better, but they aren't accepted by enough merchants and people yet. In the meantime, PayPal offers a useful service. I wouldn't abandon it for philosophical reasons and certainly not in support of someone as despicable as Tommy Robinson.

In large Chinese cities, most people pay using payment processors like WeChat Pay. They launch the app, scan the merchant's QR code and press a button to pay. It takes less time that to count the money. Mobile wallet apps to pay with bitcoin aren't more complicated than that. It's also foolproof. You can't send money to the wrong address if you scan the merchant's QR code. Even if you typed the bitcoin address manually (which is silly if you're using a mobile phone with a camera), you can't really type a wrong address since there's a checksum in the address and any mistyped character would result in your wallet telling you that the address is invalid. The only complicated (for technologically illiterate people) thing at this point is buying bitcoin and that's largely due to KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations. Everything has been getting easier year after year and that should continue.

There's nothing wrong with buying bitcoin from a random store. If the bitcoin is in your wallet and the transaction is confirmed, it's yours.

It's great to have the opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies this way. The store is probably not complying with the law, but that's their problem, not the buyer's.

If it's his own vehicle and bitcoin transactions represent a small percentage of all transactions, the volatility isn't really an issue, especially when you consider that the price has been increasing for nearly all of bitcoin's 9 years.
The buyer has no incentive to pay with bitcoin though, but some people do because they want to promote adoption or because they bought their bitcoins years ago for a fraction of what they're worth today.
You can't expect the price to be stable at the moment because the offer is inelastic by design and the demand has been exploding in the past 6 months. The price will get a chance to stabilize in the future as the market gets bigger and more liquid.

Creditors had to fill a form on mtgox.com before a deadline to file a claim. I received an email from MtGox in April 2015 telling me that I had to file a claim. I believe that they extended the deadline at some point. They warned me 4 times about the coming deadline. In February 2016, they published a list of the claims they had accepted and rejected. An appeal process started and a new list was published in May and June 2016. You can't file a claim anymore at this point, people who missed the final deadline have been out of luck for years, but I still encourage you to follow the proceedings because some creditors are trying to convince the court to allow creditors to decide how they want the remaining money to be distributed. If this happens, you might get a chance to submit a claim after all.

It certainly should. Start horizontal. Fetch the price movement in % for the last 30 days (or for the 24 hours if you prefer) online. Move 2° counterclockwise for every 1% price increase or 2° clockwise for every 1% price drop. Everything over a 45% price increase would be completely vertical. The little guy deserves to go straight up when it reaches a 45% increase anyway. Similarly, a 45% crash would point straight down, which is equally fair.

Plenty of major mobile wallet apps still haven't implemented SegWit, they're still giving bitcoin addresses that aren't compatible with the optimization. If one link of the chain is broken, you aren't going to see a strong SegWit adoption.
Once all major mobile wallet apps are finally giving SegWit addresses by default, the percentage of SegWit transactions should explode since exchanges are sending people's bitcoins through SegWit already.
From then on, it should become rare to see non-SegWit addresses and people will be making SegWit transactions without even knowing what SegWit is.

Calling Roger Ver a great man or a visionary is just silly. He's a temperamental child and an opportunist ready to throw you under the bus if he can make a dollar out of it.
Since you take Satoshi's comments as gospel, you might like to know that he basically said that recording all the transactions in a single blockchain that uses proof-of-work (which is what BCH does) isn't sustainable because it doesn't scale. He also envisioned a future where we would be mindful ("tyrannical" is the term he used) of the size of the blockchain (which is what BTC does). [(Source)](
You're being lied to and manipulated with conspiracy theories. That's the reason why some people are calling BCH a scam. It was created to try to wrestle the development of bitcoin away from the current developers even though any competent developer is welcome to work on the project. The only reason why some BCH proponents oppose SegWit is because SegWit closed the ASICBoost exploit that was benefitting Jihan Wu's Bitmain directly.
Bitcoin (BTC) never stopped following Satoshi's vision.
I feel terrible for the people who swallowed the Kool-Aid and stand to lose everything betting on a contentious fork that was rejected by a large majority of users. Roger Ver still has most of his BTC, he isn't completely crazy.
The BCH blockchain failed to obtain consensus, its blocks are still nearly empty 8 months after it forked while BTC's blocks are being filled with transactions. The white paper describes the consensus mechanism. The vote happened and BCH lost. The coup failed, just like all other previous attempts promoted by Roger Ver. It's crazy to maintain it alive artificially.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:20:06
The true bitcoin is the one that didn't fork and which is called bitcoin by a large majority of people. If Satoshi fired his client, it would download and verify the BTC chain, not the BCH chain.
Implying that bitcoin is pumped is rich coming from someone who supports a contentious fork that doesn't get used and is propped by artificial pumps on a regular basis.
It's great that bitcoin is evolving through optimization and innovation. The Internet wouldn't be able to serve so many users today had it not evolved through second-layer solutions. Bitcoin's base layer hasn't changed drastically apart from the implementation of SegWit, which by the way is completely optional.

You spent 800€ on groceries for a single person? That's insane. Where did you shop? My cousin who lives alone in Paris spends 350€. I spend 300€ in Strasbourg.  
Nurses don't earn 1200€ per month in France. They earn 1615€ plus many forms of bonuses at the very beginning of their career.  
Minimum wage in France is \~1500€ which corresponds to \~1150€ after you pay for social security (public healthcare, private health insurance, retirement, unemployment insurance).  
Only 10.6% of workers receive minimum wage. The only taxes that they have to pay are VAT, fuel tax and land tax if they own the land they live on.  
They also receive an extra 155€ from the state each month and they qualify for a subsidized apartment.  
I could live alone in a small yet nice studio apartment in a fairly expensive city for 450€ per month before subsidies and this includes all utilities. The only major taxes would be 20% of VAT (5.5% on food) and the fuel tax. At minimum wage, this would leave me with 855€ per month (more if my rent is subsidized) to pay for my food, transport costs, various expenses and leisures, which is enough to live comfortably, but simply. The cost of living is fairly reasonable in France, which is why virtually no one needs to have multiple jobs or live with a roommate once they're employed.

Do you understand how mining works?
The current power consumption isn't determined by the computational power needed by the bitcoin network to function. The bitcoin network would be perfectly fine even if a large majority of the mining rigs exploded simultaneously.
What determines the power consumption of the bitcoin network is how many people and companies are willing to compete with one another for the bitcoins awarded every 10 minutes (reward + fees).
A new block is added to the blockchain every 10 minutes on average regardless of how many people use bitcoin. You could multiply the number of users by 100 without adding a single machine to the bitcoin network.

It's difficult to know what to make of a number like this. It may be useful in a couple of years as a reference point to compare increasing adoption.

I wouldn't bother with a paper wallet if you don't understand the basics and have a Trezor on the way. Just send them to the Bitcoin address generated by the Trezor when it arrives. By the way, make sure that your Trezor hasn't been tampered with if you aren't buying it from the company directly. Some people have received hardware wallets that had already been set up by a thief. Your Trezor will make you write down a deterministic seed (24 words) that lets you recover your bitcoins if anything wrong happens. If you receive a piece of paper with a 24-word seed already written on it, it's an attempt to steal your bitcoins and you shouldn't use the Trezor in that case.

I believe that you're talking about "ticket restaurant". They're meal vouchers given to employees by the employer as a benefit. You can spend them at restaurants or grocery stores to pay for food.
Most of my meals cost quite a bit less than what you've spent.
What you bought would feed two people, so I would divide the price by two. I wouldn't eat two pieces of meat, I couldn't eat an entire onion or even an entire pepper, let alone two. The kit box is designed to feed four people, although realistically, it would feed two people.
Also, these are expensive ingredients. You can stay away from name brands without sacrificing quality. You usually get products with simpler ingredients that are less processed.
I don't struggle to keep the average cost of my meals under 5€. I buy my potatoes and onions by the sack, I tend to take advantage of deals (which happen all the time) and I stay away from single-portion packs, which tend to be quite a bit more expensive by the kilogram. For chicken breasts for instance, I'd buy a pack of four, freeze two, eat one the same day and the other one the next day.
Fruits, vegetables and even groceries in general are more costly in Paris because renting commercial space is very expensive in the French capital, but I don't think that any Parisian I know spends 500€ per person per month on groceries.
My sister, who lives in Strasbourg, told me that she spends between 40€ and 80€ per week on groceries.

The trustee has been fairly diligent and competent so far. He doesn't have too many options.
Most creditors want the remaining BTC, BCH and BTG to be divided up, but this can't be done in a bankruptcy under Japanese law. Our only hope is that the court agrees to civil rehabilitation. If this happens, we could get approximately 1/4th of a bitcoin for every bitcoin we had in MtGox. If the court refuses, we get $470 per bitcoin and the shareholders become billionaires, although Mark Karpelès (who owns most of the shares) claimed that he didn't want the money and would redistribute it to the creditors.

I don't believe that it's a fraudulent operation, however, $2.2B is a huge amount of money and it doesn't make any sense to compare that amount to the market cap. The amount of money that was spent to reach a market cap of $242B is nowhere near $242B. Only a few bitcoins are worth the current market price and most bitcoins were purchased for a fraction of the current price.

My father spent 4 years building the family house. He almost did it singlehandedly. He received the land from his parents for free because they had paid for his sisters' expensive studies while he was always helping at the family businesses. It wasn't an attractive piece of land, it had 3 derelict 17th/18th century houses and a large barn that had to be demolished first. He worked extremely hard to build a very comfortable house. Double exterior walls (50cm thick) and floor heating in every room weren't common here in the early 80s.
Super hard work, free land and good timing with the interest rates and inflation resulted in a quality house that was paid off very quickly in spite of low monthly payments.
Then the family had a good garden, which was a hobby for my father. My mother could also bring a lot of cheap or free food from her work since it was a fairly large grocery store that was only manned by 2 to 4 people.
When housing is super cheap, when food is super cheap, when one of the two cars is a company car and the other one isn't extravagant, when the social security system is particularly advantageous ([local law in Alsace-Moselle]( you can live very comfortably and still save in spite of modest wages.


Of course I could trust myself with a credit card, I just really don't need one. Most of what I earn is invested and a good portion remains highly liquid. I also keep an emergency fund. How am I limiting myself? A credit card wouldn't benefit me in any way. The debit card is cheaper and simpler. We don't have credit scores here.

The lawyer doesn't have the stolen bitcoins, he has the remaining bitcoins that the thief wasn't able to steal. Mark Karpeles, the owner of MtGox, claims to have found these bitcoins in an old wallet that hadn't been used for a couple of years. The trustee, the lawyer in charge of the bankruptcy, was tasked with keeping these bitcoins safe until he's ready to distribute them (or rather their value) to the 25,000 creditors who are owed money by MtGox. With this sale, the trustee made sure to have enough money to reimburse all the creditors. Of course, the creditors would rather get their share of what's left in the bitcoin wallet rather than $470 per bitcoin, which was the value of a bitcoin at the time of the bankruptcy.

Of course, if you tried to buy an illegal product, you can't contact the police and the money is gone.

I had to look at your comment history to make sure that you aren't just caricaturing people who support BCH for fun, but it looks like you're repeating "Satoshi's vision" in every comment unironically. It's becoming a meme at this point. Satoshi would probably laugh at the notion that some people want bitcoin to never evolve, even though the pressure from the innovation brought by other cryptocurrencies makes evolution and optimization an imperative. Respectfully, it looks like you're just repeating soundbites without understanding what you're talking about, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong.

I can't find anything particularly exciting in this thread. John Oliver's segment was more factual than nearly everything that is being written about cryptocurrencies by people who don't specialize in the subject.
21 comments have been written so far in this thread and they're overwhelmingly positive. His simplified explanation of bitcoin and the blockchain wasn't perfect, but it was good enough. I liked that he was humble about it instead of being a lazy cynic and mocking what he doesn't understand like so many people who aren't familiar with the technology do.
Warning people about ridiculous ICOs, Ponzi schemes, shitcoins and market manipulation was reasonable as well.
It was a balanced take and I'm grateful for it.

Bitcoin is the least likely cryptocurrency to crash to zero overnight. It's the safest store of value by far when it comes to cryptocurrencies because its code is old and trustworthy, the major development team takes a conservative approach and it has the best security by far. The free and instant cryptocurrencies could be shown to have a catastrophic bug at any moment. Still, 18% of my portfolio is in one of those free and instant cryptocurrencies, but I feel that it's responsible to have 82% in bitcoin, especially since bitcoin will probably be the main benefactor of the next mania considering that most people still barely know that bitcoin is electronic money and haven't heard about any other cryptocurrency.

Jed McCaleb sold MtGox to Mark Karpeles in 2011. The bitcoins started disappearing after that, although some of them might already have been lost for other reasons at that point. Mark Karpeles bears the sole responsibility. He spent some time in jail and was released on bail in 2016. He plead not guilty, but I don't know if the trial has happened already. The craziest thing is that he might become a billionnaire if creditors only receive what their bitcoins were worth at the time of the crash. He could receive most of the surplus. He said that he doesn't want the money and that it would be redistributed, but who knows what's going to happen.

I have a Trezor, but you should be able to generate a SegWit address in your Ledger Nano S and then you simply send your bitcoins from the old address to the SegWit address. I don't know how the Ledger Nano S works exactly, but it might require that you update the firmware if you haven't updated it since the company implemented SegWit. With the Trezor, they give you a SegWit address by default when you set it up.

When you bought your bitcoin for $200 and it's now worth $8,000, buying something you need with it can be pretty appealing if you don't want to pay the tax you owe on the gain. You're unlikely to get caught by your taxation authority if you do this, but if you sell your bitcoin at an exchange and the money lands into your bank account, not paying the tax gets quite dangerous. Also, there are plenty of people who are bitcoin rich and cash poor.

At the moment, the fee you need to pay to make a bitcoin transaction is very low, it's a fraction of a dollar. This is a good opportunity to send your bitcoins from a normal address (generally starts with "1") to a SegWit address (generally starts with "3"). 
SegWit is a protocol that reduces the weight of a transaction so that more transactions can be processed every 10 minutes. More transactions processed every 10 minutes translates as fewer transactions competing to be processed quickly, leading to a lower average fee.
The fee is calculated as a number of satoshis (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin) per weight unit. Since SegWit transactions have a lower weight than normal transactions, they're cheaper than normal transactions.
Once your bitcoins are transferred to a SegWit address, you'll be able to make SegWit transactions, which will be cheaper to make and better for the bitcoin network.
To get a SegWit address, you need a SegWit compatible wallet. I use a Trezor hardware wallet, but there are compatible wallet apps for Android and iOS. Once you have a SegWit address, use your old wallet to send your bitcoins to your new SegWit compatible wallet.

The bitcoins never truly land into your wallet. They're on the blockchain, assigned to an address you control with your wallet. Your wallet gives you a bitcoin address (a public key), you tell the seller to send the bitcoins to that bitcoin address and the transaction gets recorded on the blockchain. At that point, the blockchain has a certain number of bitcoins assigned to your bitcoin address. Your wallet simply reads the blockchain and tells you that the bitcoin address in your wallet has a certain number of bitcoins assigned to it.
Now imagine that you want to sell your bitcoins to your friend. Your wallet contains the private key associated with your bitcoin address and that private key lets you spend those bitcoins by telling the blockchain that you want to assign them to someone else's bitcoin address.
From your end, you just have to enter your friend's bitcoin address and your wallet will do everything in the background. Your wallet will help you choose an adequate transaction fee and will sign the transaction with your private key, proving that you have the right to spend the bitcoins that were assigned to your bitcoin address. When the transaction is recorded onto the blockchain, your bitcoins get assigned to your friend's bitcoin address.

Saving your 12 or 24-word seed allows you not to have to bother with saving individual private keys. It's quite a bit easier and more foolproof. Your private keys are calculated by putting your seed through a standard algorithm and this allows you to recover all of the private keys you ever used and will ever use. When you save your seed, you won't have to back your wallet up again in the future.
On the other hand, if your wallet is just a collection of random private keys, you might spend some BTC and have the change sent to an address you didn't back up yet. If your device breaks at this point, the BTC that was sent as change to that address is lost forever.
A deterministic seed is the way to go for your backup, you really don't need to mess with the individual private keys.
I'm not sure what you mean when you talk about having a copy of the blockchain. The blockchain just tells everyone that a certain amount of BTC is assigned to this or that address, but you need the private key to be able to spend the BTC assigned to the corresponding address.

This was a bitcoin transaction. It could be someone doing something as simple as sweeping a paper wallet. Regulations don't come into play. If you're talking about buying $100M worth of bitcoin, it's easier to do today than it was in 2013 because the market is more liquid and there are more services that help buyers acquire large amounts of bitcoins over the counter or through an auction. Nothing has changed drastically in terms of AML (anti-money laundering) or KYC (know your customer) since 2013.

I was affected and I don't want him to sell the remaining BTC, nor do a vast majority of the other creditors. We want people who were owed cash to receive their cash and the remaining bitcoins (BTC, BCH, BTG) to be distributed. In this scenario, we'd receive 1/5th to 1/4th of a bitcoin for every bitcoin we had at MtGox. Those who had cash would be made whole, those who had bitcoins would receive quite a bit more than the value of our bitcoins at the time, which is fair.

Bitcoin doesn't need nearly as many miners as it has now to be perfectly secure. With fewer miners, mining would become easier. There will still be more than enough miners competing for the block reward, even after it halves a few times. If the fees are too low, people will make on chain transactions and the fees will rise. If the fees rise, people will opt for second layer solutions like the Lightning Network. It's a self-correcting problem.

It doesn't cost a ton of electricity to make a transaction. The energy consumption would be practically the same if everyone stopped making transactions. This demonstrates that you don't understand bitcoin. Bitcoin would still be perfectly secure with much less computational power. Power usage is at the current level because miners want to make money. They use energy they choose to pay for because it's profitable, but the bitcoin network doesn't need nearly as much power. If they could earn more money using the computational power at their disposal for something else, most of them would be gone tomorrow. Processing transactions and making the network even more secure are just side effects.

I think that your estimation is wrong by an order of magnitude.
The width of a $100 bill is 15.6 centimeters, which puts the width of the sheet at approximately 64 centimeters. The stack looks a bit taller than it's wide. 80 centimeters seems reasonable. That's about half the size of an average woman.
The thickness of a $100 bill is 0.0043 inches. If we assume that there's no void between the sheets, 80 centimeters of sheets would contain 7324 sheets. At $3200 per sheet, it would represent a sum of $23,436,800.
It isn't unreasonable to assume that they would package a round number of sheets or a round amount of money together. This leads me to believe that the stack probably represents a total of $20,000,000 and 6250 sheets or 5000 sheets for a total of $16,000,000.

The reason why I don't like when newcomers mess with paper wallets is because it's the easiest way to do something wrong.
Some newcomers posted a picture of their paper wallet and got their bitcoins stolen immediately. Some of them created the paper wallet using a compromised generator that sent the private key to a thief allowing him to steal the bitcoins. Some of them saved the paper wallet on a compromised computer and ended up getting their bitcoins stolen. Some of them saved their bitcoins on a flash drive that became corrupted by the time they wanted to retrieve their bitcoins.
It's can be very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Since you don't have a printer, you should copy your paper wallet to at least another flash drive or you can write the private key or the deterministic seed on a piece of paper. Storing your paper wallet on a single flash drive is quite dangerous. Keeping it unencrypted on a computer that's connected to the Internet is also dangerous.

Exactly. There's no incentive to be a good custodian of the blockchain if you increase the block size every time a block is filled. When optimizing a transaction makes that transaction cheaper, users start caring and choose service providers who implement these optimizations. Similarly, bitcoin would never have gotten so close to being ready for mass adoption if we kept kicking the can down the road by repeatedly increasing the block size instead of working on a second layer scaling solution like the Lightning Network. I just saw a picture of the Bitconnect guy being recorded on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. This type of shit doesn't belong on thousands of computers in perpetuity.

What if we created a form of transaction that would attach an alias to a bitcoin address? Since that alias creation would be signed by the owner of the address, a wallet would look at the blockchain to match a payment sent to the alias to the corresponding address. To redirect the alias to a new address, you'd have to make a transaction signed by the old private key as well as the private key of the new address. The good aliases would probably be taken very quickly (depending on how expensive the transaction fees are when the service comes online), but we could have a decentralized market for these where the owner of a good alias could sell it to a buyer for a price in bitcoin.

My barber has a credit card terminal, but she prefers cheques because there are no fees. I have a few online stores and receive about as many cheques as bank transfers. The vast majority of people pay via credit card and PayPal though.

In 10 years, when said thing will have been sitting buried in a landfill for over 5 years, I can guarantee you that you'll come back here and complain about making such a poor decision. There's nothing worth $70 that you need more than an opportunity to really multiply your money. Earlier today, the price of bitcoin reached 1000 times what it was when I bought my first bitcoins in early 2012. You should give your 0.007 BTC a chance to be worth more than beer money.

Another 10X is practically a given if nothing catastrophic happens. Either that or it goes back to zero, but the price can't stay around the current level since bitcoin is still early in its adoption phase. It recently made 1000X since my first purchase, but I don't think that it's an opportunity I'll see again, except possibly in the long term.
If the price doubles 7 times from now on, we will be at 128X. I think that bitcoin is still capable of this kind of growth. If we reach $8000 by the end of the year, bitcoin will have doubled 3 times in 2017 alone.

There's something I don't understand. I have most of my bitcoins in an Armory paper wallet and some of them in a Mycelium wallet on my old Android phone. I have the seeds for both. Does that mean that I have received free money in the form of BCH? If I sold the BCH on an exchange, would my BTC still be perfectly secure since the private keys are the same? Also, am I future-proof with my Armory and Mycelium wallets?

Superb analysis.
Another factor that must be taken into account is that some major exchanges weren’t batching their transactions and weren’t using SegWit during the recent frenzy. These actors account for a huge percentage of the transactions. When the next frenzy happens, Coinbase (to name the worst offender) will be a significantly better steward of the blockchain. I really hope that all the popular wallet apps will be ready as well and that virtually all newcomers will be provided with a SegWit address by default.

I wanted to give some bitcoins to my sister and my female cousin for Christmas in 2013. People told me that it was a shit gift, so I didn't. I gave some to my male cousin for his birthday in 2014, he laughed, didn't thank me and never bothered getting them out of Mt.Gox.
I've put some bitcoins aside for my female cousin (46€ already worth 61€) and sister (100€ already worth 117€) a few days ago, but I've decided not to tell them. If all goes well, they'll get a really nice gift in 5 or 10 years. 
I tried to convince my friends to buy a few bitcoins in 2012 and again in 2014, but no one ever showed any interest. I've never been a bitcoin evangelist, I just wanted them to get the same opportunity I did.
The only people who showed any interest were my father and my doctor. My father bought 21 bitcoins for 2000€, but he got scared and sold them a few months later for what he had paid. I talked about bitcoin to my doctor when he told me that he had lost 30,000€ on a solar energy investment because the solar panels hadn't been installed before a deadline. Hopefully he bought some as the price quadrupled since our conversation.
I won't try to convince anyone anymore. It's their loss.

The price is getting higher because the demand is growing and because people who have converted national currencies into BTC don't want to convert BTC back into national currencies while the price keeps increasing.
If bitcoin succeeds in the long term by appealing to a non-negligible percentage of humans, its value will be much higher, just because of its scarcity. If it fails to catch the interest of the general public, its value will probably stay low or go to zero.
A $500 bitcoin only makes sense during the adoption phase. The same is true for a $5,000 bitcoin. If 10% of the human population owns part of a bitcoin, a bitcoin will be worth a fortune.
No one knows if a bitcoin will be worth a fortune or nothing in 20 years, in my opinion it's 50/50, but I choose not to convert the capital gains my investment is earning just yet because I think that the blockchain is a very solid piece of technology and that being the original cryptocurrency will allow bitcoin to stay on its pedestal.

Once all hardware wallets, mobile wallet apps and exchanges give and use SegWit addresses by default, virtually every new bitcoin owner will make SegWit transactions exclusively. The only legacy transactions will come from old users who haven't moved their bitcoins in a long time or who haven't updated their software. Bitcoin Core is ready, hardware wallets are ready, major exchanges are about ready, mobile wallet apps are still lagging behind. I expect the percentage of SegWit transactions to grow steadily in the next few months and to explode when the next mania happens.

It absolutely is a waste if you earn less than the cost of electricity and the cost of the mining equipment. You're always better off buying the bitcoins in that case.

I never called Bitcoin Cash a scam, I simply replied to your question. You asked how they attempted to take Bitcoin over.
I believe however that Roger Ver and others are guilty of behaving in ways that can be described as unethical and fraudulent.


The market did decide and chose the original chain. Bitcoin didn't split in two, a small faction that was never able to obtain consensus split away through a contentious hard fork.
They rallied 10% of the community. Claiming that their chain is Bitcoin is a deliberate attempt to mislead.


The group that controls the repository for the most popular client effectively controls the direction of the development of the protocol.
The Bitcoin community entrusted the group that was started by Satoshi. It's managed by Wladimir van der Laan who isn't employed by Blockstream and anyone can submit code to the project.
By sticking with Bitcoin Core, the community stated that it trusts the team that has been maintaining the original repository since the beginning and refuses to have the development taken over by people who align with Roger Ver and Jihan Wu or who are financed by them.

I dream of being able to buy an apartment in NYC (I'm from Europe), but with just over 6 bitcoins, I'd be so scared of selling some of them, even if they reached $100,000 per bitcoin someday. With 360, you can easily sell a fourth or even half and still be heavily invested in bitcoin. That's an ideal situation.

If you were the NSA, it would be irresponsible not to develop these tools. I bet that they've had powerful analysis tools at their disposal for the past 5 years. With AI, they might become scarily effective and in that case, the only thing saving you would be that they don't have enough manpower to prosecute everyone.
If I sold drugs online, I'd be insanely careful, using tumbling in conjunction with privacy coins, a couple of homemade VPNs with automated secure wiping capabilities in foreign countries, a laptop purchased with cash a couple of years in advance and with the camera and microphone disabled physically, using Linux on an external encrypted storage device that can be destroyed easily, my Internet access would happen through 4G connections (would using data plans from foreign countries and bought with false identities help or increase risk?) and one of the 4G connections would act as another homemade VPN, this time located somewhere close where I could easily detect a physical intrusion.
I wonder how feasible it would be to hide a 4G VPN in a wall (behind an electrical socket for easy access to power and to the wall's insulation material to create a cavity without leaving a trace) at a property you don't own (Airbnb, etc...).
The fact that transactions are recorded forever on the blockchain must be quite scary for criminals. You can get into situations like a serial killer who killed in the 1970s getting caught today because his niece sent her DNA to 23andMe even though DNA profiling didn't exist in the 1970s.

The high fees were a great incentive to work even harder on scaling solutions. People wouldn’t have gotten angry with the service providers that didn’t implement SegWit in a timely manner if the cost of a non-SegWit transaction &amp;dans remained under $1. When it comes to the Lightning Network, the high fees helped raise awareness and probably convinced people to start using unfinished software on the mainnet, but it didn’t affect its development significantly, the various Lightning Network projects were nearly ready for testing by the time the frenzy started.

Of course, but past performance definitely helps give some perspective to the people who have known about bitcoin for less than a year. All other things being equal, something that has happened 10 times already on a market is more likely to happen again than to never happen again. Claiming that bitcoin missed its chance is shortsighted and all of the people who did so between 2009 and 2017 were proven wrong.
Scaling solutions are being created and implemented constantly. Ultimately, bitcoin could even have a side chain for everyday transactions with a value pegged on bitcoin and based on a scalable technology such as Nano's block lattice, offering instant and free transactions.

Good advice.
I think that I'm going to create a new wallet on my Trezor and just keep a single bitcoin or maybe half a bitcoin on it so that I won't put my entire stash in jeopardy if I ever need to spend some of it in an unconventional and potentially risky manner, for instance if I need to type the passphrase on a device I can't trust fully.
Having multiple wallets might also allow you to keep most of your money safe if you get robbed. You give the attacker the wallet with half a bitcoin on it and never mention the other wallet. Half a bitcoin should be enough to convince an attacker that it's your only wallet and that torturing you is pointless.
For people who want to keep their passphrase or private keys in a safe, I would recommend manually encrypting them with a simple cypher if there's any risk that a burglar could open the safe or steal the entire safe. I believe that keeping an encrypted version of the passphrase outside of the safe and hidden well (written on the back of a light switch, engraved on a pure silver dog tag or coin that you put in a zip bag and bury in your garden, etc...) is safer than having it inside of a safe that can be moved by a couple of strong men.
Keeping the passphrase or private keys in at least two locations is of the utmost importance as well. If your house burns, your Trezor will burn just as well as the paper card on which you wrote the passphrase. If you absolutely need to have a safe deposit box as your second location, your passphrase or private keys should definitely be kept in a sealed envelope and manually encrypted.

Over 20 thousand people filed valid claims in the Mt.Gox liquidation proceedings and claims for over 100 bitcoins are fairly common, but I suppose that the average number of bitcoins owned became much lower since 2014.

As I mentioned in another comment, bitcoin is like a version of gold that's very easy and much quicker to transmit, that can't have rods of tungsten hidden into it or any other type of forgery for that matter, that doesn't cost much to store safely, that can be carried on your person at all times and over borders completely stealthily by just remembering 12 or 24 words, that can be divided into tiny units easily, that can be purchased at market price instead of having to pay a premium, that can't be confiscated and that can be exchanged pseudonymously. If you don't see the potential value in that, you're either blinded by hate or dishonest.
It can't serve a few billion people in its current state, but people are working on scaling solutions (optimizations, side chains, second layer solutions) that could achieve this. Alternative technologies such as the block lattice with pruning are extremely promising.
You can't seriously expect the price to be stable during the adoption stage. It's patently impossible because of the constant influx of new users. It will get a chance to stabilize after reaching a critical mass of users and after most potential users have had a chance to decide whether they want to participate in this ecosystem or not.

Because people who have cryptocurrencies tend to want to keep them unless what they want to buy can only be purchased with cryptocurrencies. Paying via PayPal is super easy (you just have to type your email address and password) and very safe for the buyer, even though it's awful for the seller. There just isn't enough of us for a typical brick and mortar shop to notice an increase in sales. Setting it up with your accountant, installing a terminal that can display a QR code and training your employees so that they know how to operate it, won't get scammed and won't steal your cryptocurrencies can be more trouble than it's worth. We're going to need to attain a critical mass of users if we want brick and mortar business owners to feel compelled to start accepting bitcoin.

You didn't understand his comment.
He's talking about drugs, firearms, stolen electronics, looted antiquities, stolen art, untaxed cigarettes, etc..., which get exchanged for cash everywhere in the world even though it's illegal. Billions of dollars exchange hands on these markets each year.
It's almost certain that cash will disappear at some point in the future since governments are so eager to be able to track all transactions and since the average human uses cash less and less compared to a few decades ago when payment cards weren't as ubiquitous.
Cash will disappear, but the need for means of exchange that are anonymous or pseudonymous will always exist. People could be going back to gold, but in all likelihood, cryptocurrencies will become the means of exchange of choice for people who used to use cash for their secret transactions.
Banning exchanges would hurt bitcoin's use case as an alternative currency for everyday transactions, but it wouldn't affect bitcoin's use case as means of exchange for transactions in the parallel economy. A minuscule percentage of humans own bitcoin at this time and look what that did to its price. If bitcoin were used for all illegal transactions in the world, its price would be higher than it is today.
Bitcoin would get in people's hands just like billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs are getting in people's hands today.

It has plenty of similarities with gold (rare, slowly growing supply, increasingly harder to mine, global market) and all you need for it to be used as a store of value like gold is people deciding to do so in addition to stability, of course. So far bitcoin has done a fantastic job at preserving value. The only people who lost value in the past 9 years are those who bought bitcoin at the height of a mania 6 months ago. I'm quite confident that they'll get their value back in the next couple of years.
Forks aren't much of an issue. They don't increase the supply and the vast majority of people see them for what they are: worthless cash grabs destined to go to zero quickly.
I don't mind admitting that bitcoin's main use case has been black markets for most of its history. It isn't that great for money laundering. Today, the main use case seems to be its usefulness on the cryptocurrency trading market. Bitcoin has tons of potential use cases and the main use case might change at any point while we're in the adoption phase.
It's extremely easy to avoid losing your private keys today. It wasn't in the past and people weren't very careful when the price of bitcoin was counted in cents, but wallet seeds have almost eliminated the risk of accident.
Robberies aren't exclusive to bitcoin and the risk of getting everything stolen can be alleviated with simple security measures. A decoy wallet will keep most of your money hidden and safe from criminals. People can't know how much you own unless you're careless.
As for the prospect of mass adoption, telling you that I don't know and can't know is the only honest reply I can give you. I don't know how long and what it will take. Banks could start offering bitcoin to their clients as part of a well-rounded portfolio and we could end up with a large percentage of Westerners having some of their money stored in bitcoin. Investment funds could do the same. ETFs could be created and generate a huge amount of volume. It could easily become the go-to currency for people who travel abroad. We'll see how it plays out. The only certainty is that adoption isn't linear, we can count on the network effect.

That's an assertion you can't make without sharing your rationale. I don't see why one of the use cases should trump the other.
The Lightning Network is still protected by proof-of-work since  normal transactions are needed to open and close a payment channel. There's nothing wrong with off-chain transactions, the final balances are recorded on-chain eventually. If the Lightning Network can be implemented in a completely seamless and straightforward manner, it can allow bitcoin to scale, even though further optimizations that effectively act like block size increases will likely be needed.
If block lattice is shown to scale, we could even imagine creating a side-chain with a coin pegged on bitcoin for everyday payments while bitcoin could be used as a more secure and censorship-resistant savings account.

The first and most popular Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Core doesn't exist on the Bitcoin Cash network.

Buying bitcoins on an exchange is incredibly easy. You open an account for free, verify it by sending a picture of your ID, wire the funds you want to spend, convert the $ into BTC and voilà!

I transform and sell high-margin chemicals that are useful to researchers, manufacturers, educators and enthusiasts who aren't necessarily knowledgeable, but want to examine their properties.
The first three categories of customers typically pay via SEPA transfers and within 30 days instead of immediately when I trust them. Enthusiasts pay via PayPal for the most part.
I also sell precious historical artifacts such as objects that were launched into space (some of them landed on the surface of the Moon) and carried back down to Earth by astronauts, antiquities (2500-2000 year-old gold and silver coins and ingots, ancient art...) and antiques.
Lastly, I sell a little bit of modern silver and gold occasionally. It's never much though, right now I'm just parting with a $50 American Buffalo .9999 gold troy ounce for instance. The only time I've sold silver for bitcoin was in 2014.

He probably hates it as much as he likes the chance of making an extra 20% in that same amount of time.
Look at his prices, his margins are massive. An online reseller selling on Amazon with minuscule margins couldn't afford it, but this guy can totally afford price fluctuations.
He probably keeps a good portion of the bitcoins he earns in bitcoin. Someone doing it over the past 9 years would have made a significant amount of extra money. Much more than would have been lost over the past 6 months.
If bitcoin keeps growing in popularity, its value will most likely keep increasing over the years. Many fortunes were built this way in history. Betting on bitcoin isn't unreasonable. The risk is fairly high, but the potential payoff is huge.

I am sure that he would want to thank us back for believing in his invention and for possibly making him extremely rich in the process, assuming that he kept the bitcoins he amassed in the early days. If Satoshi is just one person, I wonder how he deals with the fact that his invention radically changed so many lives, usually for the best, but not always. It must be hard to live with such a secret. One thing is certain, he has his ego in check.

It's disheartening to think that what might really propel adoption in the West is banks offering to store (and possibly insure) their clients' bitcoins, helping them buy and sell them and making branded wallet apps. Paying with such an app that doesn't allow you to control the parameters of the transaction might make 0-conf transactions with partnering stores possible. Opening the bank's app, scanning the QR code and pressing ok is simple enough. It's the norm in large Chinese cities with WeChat Pay, so we could probably manage as well in the West. I'm not hoping that that's the future of cryptocurrencies, but it might happen.

My dream is to start a gated commune to live with kind and smart people exclusively. I’d own the land and the first buildings.
It would be a place surrounded by forest where members would strive for self-sustenance, sustainability, simple living and a sense of community. A place from which assholes who don’t respect its values could be banished by popular vote. Something like the beginning of an utopian city-state as detached from this society as possible. 
Vehicles with a combustion engine would have to be parked outside, street lights would have to be turned on manually by the people walking at night, there would be no combustion ever to guarantee that the air is always clean, no ads anywhere, no overconsumption, no moral pressure (free from religion and traditional values) apart from a duty to respect your neighbor and the environment.
It would be a place of culture and learning, hardened to face the challenges of climate change and automation.
I’m sure that many people here would hate that place, but I think that it could be wonderful.

I wouldn't be exploiting anyone's labor. Rent would be cheaper than outside of the commune and the money would be used exclusively for maintenance and expansion.  


A behavior that's compatible with the core values of the commune is the only thing that would be required of its inhabitants. Forcing people to work is the last thing I'd want. Someone who doesn't contribute (with work or funds) wouldn't have access to the fruits of other people's contributions (the food we'd grow, subsidized electricity, etc...) though.
Everyone would have the option to upvote and downvote other inhabitants. These anonymous reviews would be used to determine whether someone is a good fit or not. The upvotes and downvotes a person gives would carry more or less weight depending on the upvotes and downvotes they received themselves.  


Ideally, I'd want to live inside of a ring of forest. If you expand the town by removing 50 meters of forest in the inner ring, you'd have to plant 50 meters of forest in the outer ring, so the amount of forest would increase significantly with every increase of developed land in an effort to remain as carbon neutral as possible.
A movable fence and security cameras would probably be enough to keep strangers out. Moreover, unaccompanied strangers would stick out like a sore thumb in a town where everyone knows everyone else. The town wouldn't need heavy fortifications in the foreseeable future, I'm not expecting imminent societal collapse.

They cost $5,750 each, but you don't have to spend $5,750 and buy an entire bitcoin, you can spend however much you want and buy a fraction of a bitcoin. Buying an entire bitcoin is just a nice goal newcomers like to strive for so that they know that they own 1/21,000,000th of all the bitcoins that will ever be in existence. If bitcoin ever becomes as popular as gold or PayPal, very few people will own an entire bitcoin, there just aren't enough of them for this to happen.
You can check the price at [Bitcoinity](
If you want to buy some, open a free account at an exchange (Americans seem to like Coinbase), verify your account and you're good to go. At some point, you should learn how to manage your bitcoins by creating your own bitcoin wallet and transferring your bitcoins from the exchange to your wallet so that you fully control them. If you don't know what you're doing however, it's safer to keep the bitcoins in the exchange while you learn.
Welcome and good luck!

That's true, but at the same time it would also probably cause a panic and lead to a massive sell-off. I don't know how many bitcoins the market can absorb before a major crash happens if the seller's intentions and power aren't known, but it's most likely a tiny amount compared to the number of bitcoins that have been mined during the first year of bitcoin's existence.

It's an alternative to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would lead to the liquidation of MtGox's assets. The creditors would receive $483 per bitcoin and 100% of the cash they had at MtGox. The surplus (~160,000 BTC and BCH, plus ~200,000 BTG) would be converted into JPY and given to MtGox's shareholders (Mark Karpelès and Jed McCaleb) and the Japanese government would get a large portion of that money in taxes.
If the court accepts to switch from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, the remaining bitcoins and the forks could potentially be distributed to the creditors instead of being sold for JPY and given to the shareholders.
We could hope to receive around 1/5th of a bitcoin for each bitcoin we owned, which is substantially better than $483. Plus, converting the bitcoins and the forks into JPY would be catastrophic for the BTC, BCH and BTG markets. This would probably also affect other cryptocurrencies that have nothing to do with bitcoin.
Mark stated that he doesn't want the money and that he supports civil rehabilitation, which is fantastic. Most creditors do too in all likelihood. The court will only entertain civil rehabilitation if the plan makes sense and is in everyone's interest.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:47:39
Yes, we're at the mercy of the court. Having Mark push for civil rehabilitation certainly helps though since the court's main motivation is to avoid making a decision that would put a party in a worse situation than if they went with a bankruptcy. In a civil rehabilitation, Mark and the other investor are the only people losing some money. The Japanse government will lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of taxes if civil rehabilitation happens instead of bankruptcy, but I don't know enough about Japan to know if this could affect the court's decision.

When we were buying them for a couple of dollars in 2012, $10,000 was the Moon.
It seemed so improbable that it didn't even occur to me to buy a thousand BTC just in case.
I would just buy the amount I needed for my planned purchases and place my orders as quickly as possible so that I wouldn't risk a delay if the price dropped and I had to buy more BTC, which is what happened the first time I bought some on eBay.
Plenty of early astronauts reached the Moon, but it keeps drifting away for the rookies.

It's a reasonable suggestion, but I really wouldn't forgive myself if I missed yet another opportunity and wasted half of my newest bitcoins for a few thousands of € I don't really need. I bought my first bitcoins in February of 2012, owned enough that I would've been able to buy a house with them today had I not spent most of them, sold some and lost some to Mt.Gox. I think that I'm just going to do what I should have done years ago and hold regardless of what happens. Not adding more regrets to the pile is worth more than the money I could earn right now. I might put 1000 new € in an exchange to play the buy low sell high game with though.

Salut Mark,
I'm one of the creditors and I would like to thank you for pushing for civil rehabilitation.
I could find very little information about your legal troubles. Will there be a criminal trial? If yes, when is this supposed to happen?
Do you believe that the US seized some of the stolen bitcoins or some of the proceeds of their sale?
Do you plan on coming back to France and staying there when this is over?
Lastly, I've been wondering what happened to the money that was sent to the Polish bank account during MtGox's last days. I sent a few hundred euros a couple of days before the site disappeared to try to buy cheap bitcoins and the trustee rejected this part of my claim. Surely, the deposit could and should have been linked to my account manually. Were all the late deposits simply ignored?
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:21:28
He owns 88% of MtGox and said that the only other shareholder doesn't seem interested in his 12% of the surplus.
Us creditors would be infinitely more happy with 20-25% of a bitcoin for each bitcoin we owned than with $483 per bitcoin.
Being instrumental in the adoption of civil rehabilitation is his best chance at redeeming himself. I for one have forgiven his oversights and poor choices.
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:20:00

Thank you for your reply.
I hope that your trial and Vinnik's trial in the US will allow everyone to get a crystal clear picture of how everything happened exactly. WizSec's presentation was great, but so many questions remain.
For what it's worth, I hold no grudge against you anymore and your behavior recently has been exemplary. I sincerely hope that the time you served in jail already will cover your possible sentence. When I put myself in your shoes, I don't think that I could have coped with the extraordinary amount of pressure and doubt you've had to live with for so long. I'd probably be a depressed recluse or a fugitive.
The consequences of your oversights and poor decisions were mind-bogglingly huge, but in my opinion, you've paid enough for those oversights and poor decisions already. These actions or lack of actions should be looked at in vacuum, not through the lens of the suffering that resulted in part from them.
I didn't dispute the rejection because it wasn't a significant amount of money, because the procedure seemed complex, because I didn't have much evidence and because I always viewed this transfer at the 11th hour as a gamble that didn't pan out.
I only mentioned it because I was really surprised that the trustee didn't work with a database that included these deposits. I can understand why the deposit might not have been added to my account automatically with the site down, but I would've expected the trustee to do it or to freeze the bank account and have all deposits sent back.
I wish you the best of luck and sincerely hope that you'll be able to live in peace after the trial and the potential lawsuits that might follow.

No one can tell you this. It isn't the wisest idea to buy when the value is at an all time high. If I were you, I'd wait for a small crash, one is bound to happen sooner or later, even if it's just a $300 dip. Some people will assure you that a $2000 bitcoin is incredibly cheap compared to what it will cost in a few years. They could be right, but a bitcoin could just as well be worth nothing in a few years.
I bought 3800€ worth of bitcoins two months ago after a dip to add to the bitcoins I already own and the 3800€ turned into 6533€. I believe that I should sell for 6533€ and wait for a dip to buy 6533€ worth of bitcoins, but I'm too scared to risk it. I still think that a small crash is bound to happen, just not willing to put my bitcoins where my mouth is.

Many people have said that and I think that you're right, but I never took alts very seriously (one more mistake in my extensive list), convinced that I am that even with (currently) inferior features, bitcoin will remain the only perennial cryptocurrency, the only one with a shot at reaching the mainstream and perhaps one killer app away from it. Alts would make me feel like I'm gambling as opposed to trading, but I concede that it's pure prejudice on my part. I would never have predicted that Ethereum would get so successful. Now that I have a grasp of bitcoin's behavior, I think I'm better off trying to make 15% gains on my 1000€ every few weeks while the bulk of my bitcoins remains in cold storage. The only thing that has prevented me from doing it sooner is that I was a victim of Mt.Gox's last heist and have trust issues with exchanges. Thanks for your advice! I'm open to putting 250€ (what I can lose without feeling pissed) into any alt, do you have a suggestion?

I bought some for my sister and a different cousin at 4,000€ in October of 2017. They were excited to see it go to 16,000€, but then the bubble popped and I don't think that they ever think about their BTC anymore. I kept a copy of their keys though.
The only person who listened was my father. He had 21 BTC, but he panic sold when Silk Road was shut down.

I love bitcoin, but its market cap isn't a useful indicator of usage. We all know that bitcoin is used primarily for speculation at this point in time. Its market cap is hardly a fair representation of what bitcoin is worth. The price would crash to nothing and take the market cap down with it if for some reason too many owners tried to sell their bitcoins at the same time. It's fairer, I believe, to judge bitcoin by the size of its ecosystem.

He regrets not keeping his 21 bitcoins, but at least he got his money back. I should've bought bitcoins for my family members anyway and only tell them about it a few years later. My cousin had the bitcoins I had given him at MtGox and didn't bother making a claim to try to get some back. I don't speak to him anymore, albeit for different reasons.
