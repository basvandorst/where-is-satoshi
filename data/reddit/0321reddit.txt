Increasing by the day, just like the original Bitcoin did. Would you change your mind if the number of businesses doubled in a month? Would you reconsider using BCH as a currency if Amazon, eBay, and other companies accepted it? I don't think the mindset of "no one is using it yet" is very logical given the history of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:24:49
this guy is confused, so i'm not going to upvote this just because i want to believe it's true
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:40:39
got 'em!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:18:40
I am also intrigued by the Bitcoin debit/credit card concept, though it might be easier for me to use JMBullion and APMEX, paying with BTC/BCH directly in the future
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:00:05
dude, if you are going to sell, then just wait til it goes higher when the sell button is working, and make more money...if anything, this website crash is good for you

I heard about it just a couple months ago, but aside from not using USDT and hedging multiple cryptocurrencies, what are you suggesting we do?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:25:50
Why have confidence when BTC is becoming more unusable for an increasing percentage of the population every day? I'd give thanks if high fees were **prevented**
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:50
Check those contradictions out and read from both subreddits, friend
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:10
hope you still have some...look at them charts and this:
"We’re happy to announce that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now listed and available for trading on GDAX.

you think the market doesn't exist and there's a big conspiracy...using a peer-to-peer currency that has no centralized controller...here's a downvote for wasting everyone's time
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:07
Listen, we don't talk about ideas here! we go brigading against Roger Ver and anything that might make us self-reflect on the fundamentals of BTC for more than half a second
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:31
listen, everyone needs to hate Roger Ver and the price needs to always go up. also, most of us only have 0.001 BTC on the Coinbase app, and we've never even used a private wallet ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:59
Who is the one "enemy" of then?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:42
People who don't understand the vision of decentralized cryptocurrencies are now calling for regulation from the SEC. They fundamentally misunderstand, much like this guy making the video misunderstands how an exchange works. Each transaction has a willing seller and buyer, and Coinbase is just a ledger service for us to find someone to sell/buy from at a negotiated price. There's no conspiracy, just the invisible hand of the market and all of us involved
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:34
For those of us not religiously opposed to BCH, nothing really happened
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:56:23
i've held both, and BCH is holding $1,400 USD just fine. most of us bought BCH at levels like 300 and 700, so not sure what bleed you're talking about. there might be some moves to make in 1hr52mins when the difficulty of BTC increases 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:24:17
so many salty people who sold 100% because of what some "experts" said on Twitter. if you HODL, you hodl a bit of everything...so just let people transact on the exchange and don't bother monitoring "shitcoins" if they are so stupid
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:53:30
Ver is CEO of Bicoin.com, not Bitcoin Cash. He doesn't control the software, so I'm not sure you have the right info...highly recommend reading on as well as other subs other than this one. Then you can have the full spectrum of information
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:20:32
i was fine before Bitcoin, and i showed up for the Libertarian concept of self-ownership and liberation of the people under tyranny (Venezuela, India, etc.)
making money is just an added bonus. my investments were doing fine before, and i think most crypto idealists are the same way. for the people with only like 0.2 BTC who only use exchanges and day-trade on their phone, yes i agree that you're right
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:30
surprised this isn't banned after 3 hours. your prediction is pretty interesting given the all-time high BTC fees and the sudden Coinbase/GDAX announcement to support BCH
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:13
it has been broken for many months, but people who don't use it haven't noticed. i just sent on both BTC and BCH with $12 fees BTC with less than a cent on BCH. downvote me for stating facts and not checking for yourself ;)

how dare you be reasonable. pitchforks en-route
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:38
You need to invest and use BTC to see why BCH was forked in the first place. Try sending $1 of each to a friend to get him/her started and see how it works. To support crypto, use it and spread it :)

Thanks for getting back! I actually solved my problem here:
...by paying a 10% fee to BTC.com's SegWit BCH recovery request (link in my original post)
super strange about your situation...wipe them tears and let's get back at it  : )
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:55:01
You're implying that the person on the other end of the exchange was coerced into buying at the specific price. But that implication is wrong, which debunks the entire conspiracy of some "Coinbase plot to ruin crypto"
If you own BCH and think the price is going to zero, then sell. If you think it's going up, hodl and sell. I suspect that most people in this thread don't have a dog in the fight, but have already decided that anything BCH-related is somehow evil

If you could consolidate the fees effectively, would be interesting to see! Update us if you could :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:15
The only reason you'll be able to transfer your BTC for free is that GDAX/Coinbase are still covering the ridiculous transfer fees. Keep that in mind when you try to transfer someday from Bittrex and you pay 50 USD
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:57:24
i'm also trying to figure out a good ratio. cash-out 15% when the price doubles?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:29:45
Yeah, sounds right
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:46
Or it corrected, you know, because it jumped up to almost 20,000 USD super suddenly and it was due for a correction (like any market). I'm with ya, @_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:40

Regardless of who is a "BCash guy" or not, isn't the complaint legitimate? Have you tried using Bitcoin for anything in the past months? I had to stop using APMEX.com for bullion because of the fees, and the selection on SilverGoldBull.com isn't as good, but they take many types of crypto that transmit fast and cheap
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:31:57
Anyone with a decent amount of accumulated crypto wealth think this could be a smart way to protect yourself from big-government crusades down the road? As in, if some executive order or congressional fiat decides that cryptocurrency adopters can be retroactively taxed.
Any way to do this with a bit more anonymity? Asking for a friend.

Point me in the right direction, since you know so much
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:44:11
start your next one here with "I like Bitcoin Cash" and then ask the question
which one of your posts in got downvoted??
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:25
1. it's okay if BTC is only usable for the rich
2. write your transactions down and wait for an unknown time to broadcast them when the mempool is less crazy
3. "The value of Bitcoin is set by how many people are willing to HODL it at a given price-point, not how many people are willing to spend it."
4. Use Google Wallet for digital currency needs.
you should add a bit of economics to your education, because you're missing the entire premise of why Bitcoin was needed in warfare/welfare states around the world. go pay your VPN subscription (or similar transaction that was possible until earlier this year) with BTC and report back on the duration and cost
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:01:14
Yes, I don't test what I buy on APMEX with the "acid test" and just use a strong magnet, since i trust their service
but i won't buy anything that i can't take out of its capsule and let the buyer test it before he pays me (not that i intend to sell very often, if at all)
check this "How to Spot Fake Silver" for info here 
i think there's always a small chance you can buy a fake that passes all the tests, but this is all about mitigation. you might feel comfortable as i do by buying on JMBullion/APMEX/SDBullion and using a magnet test, but others may want to scratch/acid test themselves. if it's a good fake and gold-plated, then the acid test won't tell you much unless you also do the specific gravity test.
i'm lazy and assume that it's usually too good to be true. subscribe to if you haven't yet :)

Yep, all of us are standing by 24/7 on our Discord server to attack Bitcoin...makes sense. Couldn't be that our BTC is stuck in high-fee land and we are hedging our investments in many baskets with each market shift. Highly recommend you read other subs to get more information, as there are more sides to this story

True, but prices seem to be higher most of the time and are usually just Buy It Now anyway. Unless you have lots of eBay Bucks discounts, i haven't seen it make a difference. but other than a few dealers like APMEX on eBay, the bullion there is shady as ferk
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:16
Nah, I'm hesitant of this BTC jump in price, coupled with the current 176,000 unconfirmed BTC transactions:
...so I'm still holding some BTC but slowly taking advantage of the ratio between BTC and BCH because i think people are about to panic sell BTC when the mempool increases to an all-time high from the recent difficulty increase
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:30:13
Have you tried BCH? it's the same thing that we all got rich on years ago...actually works for super cheap
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:43:27
yes, but i've never had any other wallets other than Bitcoin. so all i have in my SPV wallet is BTC and BCH after 01Aug
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:50:02
no one is forcing anyone to use Coinbase/GDAX. no one forced people to keep their BTC in an exchange before the 01Aug fork. no one is forcing anyone to click Sell or Buy on GDAX; these are all voluntary actions. trying to protect people from themselves is how we get big government
the tiny statement "people were pumping the price" actually has no substance to it, if you think about what it's actually saying
i'm showing $3,739 on Bittrex and i'm not selling anything until past 10,000. the hodl life is for the long-run, not making $20 here and there :)

I buy from APMEX.com and don't buy anything that I wouldn't be willing to take to a pawn shop or local coin store for testing to verify. buying on eBay may save some cents each coin, but you are right that Chinese fakes are super accurate. check out if you want to find similar questions :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:10:20
Same here, except I'm factoring-in BTC and BCH, as well as altocoins...so it makes the strategy even more complicated. my gut feeling is to pull out a large chunk when i need to make a big purchase every couple of years. i'm also looking into buying gold/silver at the current low spot prices using sites like APMEX.com and JMBullion.com so that my transfer is somewhat less obvious
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:29:19

step one done, and step two: never try to day trade :P
also look into Coinbase for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) support on 01Jan2018, so you can expand your eggs into multiple baskets like ETH, LTC, BTC, and BCH. have fun and keep reading!

Venezuela is one of many countries that are oppressed by government meddling. People are starving and are moving wheelbarrows of cash to conduct business for daily necessities. Bitcoin for many years offered a solution to a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency, but the average fee now for BTC is the monthly income of a huge percentage of the world :/
The price is irrelevant; the usage of the currency for everyday people is what is most important
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:09:17
lots of time to research everyone's post history, huh?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:57:28
Maybe the increased comments are a direct result of the all-time high fee averages...but that wouldn't be as cool of a conspiracy theory. I would recommend reading other subs and not just this one

@_date: 2017-12-16 18:27:23
Anyone know a good article or analysis on whether buying bullion with cryptos can serve as some kind of protection when governments decide to increase taxes or retroactively pursue early Bitcoin users?
I've successfully used BTC to buy physical silver coins, but I realize that companies like JMBullion, SilverGoldBull, and APMEX probably report our info to the government. With that, and companies like Coinbase that are forced to give up user information/transactions, some gov't analyst can probably form a database of people who have more output via bullion that they do in cost of BTC, and tax that, yeah?
Paging all smart people who understand ~~rackets~~ tax policy :)

Not the milestone I wanted to see...
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:19
I think most of us hodl some of both, and other cryptos as well. If you really did transition to BCH, you're still doing amazingly well. I suspect your post will not age very well, nor will you learn anything from it. Are the ideas that convinced you in November any less valid than today?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:48
Yep, super glad I stayed with most of my BCH after the fork, and super glad I stayed away from BitcoinGold
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:16

So why follow Song and Antonopoulos if both of them until very recently didn't hodl BTC and didn't even have a functioning wallet to receive a transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:13:12
This! HODL both, since you don't need the money yet. Wait until BCH goes up to BTC price, and wait until you can actually transfer the BTC without losing $30

What about Bitcoin Cash don't you like? Why not hodl some of both in case of crazy circumstances?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:57:41
I look at it as my BTC/BCH is worth 100k per 1.0, and I'm just waiting for it to go back up. "Selling" is just getting more US Dollars that I was trying to escape from in the first place. Most of us are probably just "up" a couple annual salaries, and instead of selling, we're waiting for something life-changing
