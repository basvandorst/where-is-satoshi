It also applies to all cryptos traded on the exchange. Exchanges want exchange and that means they cannot allow stability to happen in any one crypto and they cannot allow any one crypto to dominate the rest.
I think the end of exchanges is coming soon. It will be when people are getting at least part of their wages in BTC and paying for stuff in BTC. The more that grows, the more exchanges die. The only way to reduce the power the exchanges have on your crypto is to use your crypto. Buy more if you have to, but use it and grow the economy.

Just say they're going sideways right now and use technical words like pennant and holding pattern.

Great initiative! Do you remember the different bitcoin puzzles and alternate reality games such as Coin Artist's [Legend of Satoshi](
A friend of mine used to work with that group that used to hang out on the LTB Network in those days and he had dreams of doing something like this [We Lost Our Gold]( puzzle, but as an offline puzzle for Bitcoin as something the general public could participate in and learn about Bitcoin along the way. I could put you in contact if you like.

It's not really giving them value here. It's using them as coupons for a sale at a fixed exchange rate. They only have 'value' within context of the sale.
