The block was mined this morning, but i dont think it automatically shows up in your wallet

Na i dont expect it to be worth much, but if i can trade it for even a few mbtc, why not?

I think 1 is worth like $300 last time i looked, but thats just the futures trading. And it was like 1200 yesterday. By the time i get it itll prob be worthless lol

well i got about a dozen friends and co-workers into crypto in the last few months, most are excited about the tech, and all of them are at least happy they made a little money even if they dont fully understand it. 
but that's how adoption happens, at least i hope
