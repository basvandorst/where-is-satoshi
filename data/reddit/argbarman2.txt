Long read but definitely worth it

From Sharon Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe all the way to CSO at CoinShares in only a few years. What a meteoric rise she's had.

Was piggy backing on your joke... less funny now that I had to explain it though

No. Henry Winkler has no association with Bitcoin

Not disagreeing with any of the other points, but this is not how markets work. There was definitely nowhere near $200B of inflows last cycle. Probably less than $10B. $200B flowing into BTC over the next year or two would probably 10x the price. The liquidity just isn't there yet.

YES. Can't wait for my BTC to be worth at least 2% more after inflation goes up. This is definitely the single biggest driver of Bitcoin's price at this point in time.

I decided a while ago that those people just deserve to be poor. Whaddya gonna do

So nobody thinks Libra launch tomorrow will catalyze a short-intermediate term decline?

Did that guy say Ethereum is dead wood but Bitcoin SV is not?

TBH I'm not sure I'd want those people buying BTC...

Yes I agree about education. Even very intelligent educated people I know still think you can only own one while BTC. Wish I knew why. When I first heard about cryptocurrency, I thought fungibility was an obvious intuitive benefit. If the 90's were any lesson, it's that most people will not take it upon themselves to learn about new technology and will simply follow the herd until the economic benefits overwhelm the social ignorance.
@_date: 2019-12-15 04:06:59
Every single halving is already priced in, this is part of the value proposition of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:48:49
This is easily accessible information. Literally any introductory page about BTC will mention fungibility. For the people you're mentioning, the only info they have is from google searching "Bitcoin price". Why do we want people like that mindlessly pouring money into BTC? Just fuels a bubble. If they changed listing prices to USD:SAT, all those people would just as easily think BTC went 100 million fold higher.

But SegWit is 2x scalability at best, right?
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:21:51
I follow the development. I'm not aware of anything significant besides LN, which is pretty shaky. Any L2 that introduces liveness assumptions has a lot of pitfalls and centralization vectors.

Troll FUD - downvote and ignore.
Info for real people: BTC is not a "payment process" any more than gold is. It is a digital store of value, the first of its kind. No it isn't now, but by the time the store of value thesis is fully proven, the investment thesis will be depleted.
BTC's value as a store of value is inversely proportional to it's function as a store of value. The reason it will be able to store all this value? It is the most secure settlement layer in the world by far. One of the most attacked networks in the world and still it remains completely secure.

I don't mean legacy finance. BTC beats legacy finance, but has failed/given up on the microtransaction side of things. Even if we assume that BTC could scale and maintain fees at that level, $1 is still too high to replace legacy financial systems. I shouldn't have to pay 2% on $50 transactions with blockchain. 
ETH is pennies for a simple payment, and actually has a viable L2 solution already active on main-net with on-chain data availability and no liveness assumptions. Fees for simple payments are fractions of a penny with these. When I say BTC is expensive, I mean in comparison to others in the space.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:18:58
Why won't the problem exist? LN?
@_date: 2019-09-28 01:36:15
It is very shitty as a payment process. Nobody will ever use BTC for payments. You *can*, but it's extremely cost inefficient.
Obviously BTC is more efficient than gold, but on the scale of efficient payment processor to gold, BTC is much much closer to the gold end of the spectrum. Most of the market value of BTC derives from its potential to act as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:16:49
No. Something like ETH is way cheaper. You can only send BTC relatively cheaply when there is no demand. If a million people wanted to start using BTC regularly, fees would be through the roof.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:09:40
How is it that I'm the delusional one? L1 is extremely cost inefficient for regular transactions. By the time LN becomes functional, there will numerous much better options. WBTC or tBTC are honestly much better options. Keep having fun trying to fit a square peg into a round hole while paying ridiculous fees to "send money to friends".
