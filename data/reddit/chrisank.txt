Thank you for your effort. It is appreciated!

I don't hold, I do technical analysis. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:00:40
Wouldn't mind it going down a little further. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:55:02
Your definition of "dip" doesn't hold up with reality, then. 
It's pretty easy to see a pattern concerning dips when looking at them on a weekly chart. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:40:43
It's a strategy. Buying low and selling high is safer.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:27:53
Well, that depends on the investment horizon, really. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:04:13
Fair enough. Still, though - you're using a technical definition of "secure", I'm using a financial. If my bitcoin can't be stolen but lose worth, they're secure from a technical point of view, but not from a financial. I personally prefer the latter kind of security. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:26:29
It's a time of great trading opportunities. Sucks if you're a holder, though. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:58:05
Too early, it's likely going to go down further. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:14:16
I'm pretty happy with this drop so far. Anticyclical trading for fun and profit and all. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:21:31
Conclusion: I think there could be a little more (short term, 2-3 months chart) correction. We're still far away from the long term (12 months) uptrend being hurt in any way. If you're (unlike me, I don't currently hold any bitcoin, sold at the right time) investing long term, I'd stay long. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:22:27
It's only a very temporary support level. Important moving averages that actually work as support are lower than 10k. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:07:11
It doesn't hurt to look at the time horizons involved. 
3 weeks: definite downturn, we're below moving average; on the other hand, though, lowest value has been 3 weeks ago. Weak signs of recovery. 
2 months - downtrend starting - moving average is just about to change its course and go down. Lower prices possibly ahead. 
3 months - hard to tell, moving average still moving up. If we close above moving average, nothing to fear. 
6 months - all good, steadily moving up, if slightly slower. 
12 months - good god there's a strong uptrend. The correction touched on 1 standard deviation above moving average. Things are looking very good. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:23:54
Have been earning well timing the bitcoin markets and outperforming holding significantly in the last 3 years. 
Most people who talk about technical analysis have no idea how technical analysis actually works, especially around here.

What country are you in? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:03:53
It's a valid approach, if the long term uptrend holds. Buying low and selling high is safer. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:24:05
Oh yes. Sold at 12000 EUR, rebought around 8500 EUR average.

@_date: 2018-01-30 15:15:50
"who is selling now?"
"Do they not know the selling was two weeks ago and the bear market is coming to an end."
That's a contradiction. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:49:18
It's kinda hard not to point and laugh at people who for some reason thought it was a good idea to buy during a huge bull run, somewhere around 16-18k. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:05:25
Correct. I know what I'm betting on. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:45:18
There's a middle ground. I do swing trading, meaning I trade once per month in average. Not every trade is profitable, of course, but as long as I outperform hodling significantly, which I do, it's all good. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:02:40
I'm long since 2017-07-16. I trade on weekly charts primarily. Most of my indicators use data of the last 5-8 weeks. For spotting long term trends I also use 26 and 52 week charts. 
I try to keep things simple - simple moving average crosses and deviation lines (using standard deviation) are the backbone of my trading. Took me a long time to figure out that simple is best in trading. 
Without going into specifics, I'm mostly a trend follower. If a see an uptrend on a 5-8 week chart I go long. If the trend is over I sell. If bitcoin crashes and we touch SMA 26 (like we did on 2017-07-16) or 52, I buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:06:19
Will it strike twice, though? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:45:07
The current fee issue is a direct result of miners gaming a peculiarity of the BCash altcoin, the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment. 
I expect things to go in cycles in the next couple weeks. 
1) miners mine mostly BCC like crazy. Fees for BTC rise (this is what is happening right now). 
2) difficulty for BCC increases significantly. Miners mine mostly BTC. The mempool will clear out, fees will go down. 
3) EDA sets in, the difficulty for BCC decreases. Go to 1)
This will continue until prices for BCC are so low it's impossible for the cycle to reset, or until we get to have a widely used version of Lightning Network. 
It'll just take us a few months to get there. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:17:45
Also, don't daytrade. The profit/work ratio for SWING trading is far better.

Advice for newbies: backtesting, backtesting, backtesting. Formulate strategies and test them. 
Nothing wrong with hodling, but it's entirely possible to outperform a hodling strategy with not too much effort. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:39:32
As far as I understand, you have to create  a segwit address. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:09:45
Nothing wrong with that. I was considering doing the same, until I started to better understand how BCC and BTC work. Made the decision a lot easier. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:39:14
Am earning lots of money timing the market. 
Respectfully, I don't care for the narrative that it's impossible to trade bitcoin. Of course it's possible. It quite simply takes effort and time. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:58:15
And it's hurting them. As difficulty increases, miners intentionally stop mining for 12 hours to make difficulty drop - no new blocks for 12 hours! 
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:15:59
Going long = holding. I hold as long as my indicators tell me to hold. Shortest time was 1 week (because I trade weekly), longest time was from 2016-08-29 to 2017-03-13. 
I do my tech analysis using 
and, mostly, lots and lots of backtesting using Excel :)
Weekly moving average 5, meaning, the average of the last 5 weeks. 
I don't recommend using my strategy without backtesting to see if it works. Don't use *any* strategy without backtesting. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:46:31
There's a middle ground. I'm outperforming hodling significantly by way of swing trading. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:38:46
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:37:52
I trade Bitcoin using technical analysis. I have been outperforming hodling significantly since 2014. 
I *never* short. I'm either long or in fiat. 
I've missed out on some profit, and on a lot of losses by not shorting. Bitcoin is far too volatile, and the fundamentals are far too good for shorting to be a sensible strategy *for me*. 
There's nothing wrong with it per se - traders more skilled than me earn lots of money shorting Bitcoin from time to time. I'm not up to it myself. Switching between going long and being in fiat is sufficient. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:10:02
Now let's destroy bitcoin! ;)
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:22:25
With the imminent BCash difficulty adjustment, if you mine Bitcoin, you'll be mining with profit very soon. It's price that matters, not hash power - and as long as 1 BTC is more worth than 1 BCash, it's more profitable to mine BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:00:24

Technical analysis. It's hard work, but it's a skill like any other, one that you can practice and improve. 
Also, as other people have said, under no circumstance, ever, invest more than you can afford to lose.

Backtesting is 99% of the work. You come up with strategies and backtest them with historical data to see if they work. Actually *using* a strategy is easy.

@_date: 2017-08-29 15:58:22
Thank you :) trading is a matter of practice. There's nothing special about it, anyone can learn it. It just takes time (and maybe basic computer skills). 
Hodling is a solid strategy for bitcoin, one that I recommend to people not interested in spending as much time trading as me :)
To give you a very basic example of a simple strategy that outperforms hodling - sell when the weekly moving average of 5 weeks moves lower; buy when the weekly moving average of 5 weeks goes up. Simple as that :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:35:24

Best thing about this is watching segwit2x futures tank ;)

I hope everyone has already sold his Segwit2x futures? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:19:06
That's not the point. The point is, if you don't have enough patience when trading bitcoin, you will definitely fail trading anything else. 
As for your question; because trading is more profitable. Holding doesn't work well in bear markets, like the one we had in 2015, like the one that will happen again sooner or later (probably later rather than sooner). 
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:35:51
Impossible to predict. It's good to always keep a (small) buy limit order. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:01:44
A coin is worth something only if people attribute worth to it by investing in it. That's how it worked with Bitcoin Cash. There was no reason to suspect that it would be the same with Segwit2x, and I'm glad I got the chance to take money away from people who thought otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:38:45
Segwit2x futures aren't doing so well right now .. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:26:21
There's lots of profitable middle ground between day trading and holding. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:12:29
Bitcoin has 25% off daily MA20 dips a couple times every year (a great place for a limit buy order). Last one was on 2017-09-15, a dip below 3000. That's where I bought my last batch of bitcoins. 
In terms of today's prices, this would happen if the price was to drop to 5500 today. 
Anything else doesn't qualify as a dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:23:30
They're supporting the network by giving miners incentives to mine. Yay for them! ;)

This is pretty bearish in the short term, as can be seen in the recent price action. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:56:33
This subreddit is oddly full of people who a) conflate trading with daytrading, for some inexplicable reason; and b) decided for some reason that daytrading without proper methodology is a thing that can work out, and when they inevitably lost money, went on to decide that daytrading (which, in their own world, is the same as trading, like there isn't any other form or trading) is bad because they failed at it. 
It's kinda fun to point and laugh at them.

It's called "confirmation bias". People who think that HODL HODL HODL is a sound investment strategy because it was a good idea in 2017 really really want their opinions to be validated, so they like positive news. 
Actual traders take into account as much pertinent information as possible, no matter if it's bullish or bearish, and draw conclusions based on that. 
But hey, right now, I profit from you people holding. Nothing wrong with that :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:29:22

Moving averages are usually a non terrible idea. We're incidentally very close to 26 weeks (half year) MA on weekly chart.

Speculative traders make money from all price movements, up or down. (Many) traders will leave once volatility is gone, not before. 
The drop that's happening right now is making many traders richer, just as the uptrend that happened before did. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:08:51
Weekly MA3 T-1 * 75%. 
In the history of Bitcoin, since November 2011 (on the Bitstamp chart), it has happened 28 times that weekly low went below weekly MA3 T-1 *75%. In all 28 cases, weekly close or weekly close T+1 was higher than weekly MA3 T-1 *75%, meaning that one could sell with profit on weekly close or the next weekly close. 
This week is  Could be that it's the very first time out of 29 that the strategy doesn't work. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:14:13
The short term consequences - the massive selloff going on - are negligible; the price will rise again, long term (but probably much slower). The precedent is very uncomfortable, bitcoin doesn't appear stable and respectable at all if a government can cause such major disruption. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:41:19
Trading according to signals on a daily/weekly chart. I personally prefer weekly, because that way, signals are easier to detect and stronger. 
It's kind of a middle ground between daytrading (too exhausting and time consuming for me) and hodling (not profitable enough by far). 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:57:41
I'm currently long on bitcoin, having bought close to the bottom. That's why, right now, I profit from people holding. I won't be long on bitcoin anymore once the bullish reaction to this drop is over. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:48:29
It's easy to be successful timing the market. It only takes proper trading methodology - such as backtesting.

I find it amusing that you feel that way. Bitcoin is an investment to me. I buy when I see an uptrend coming. I sell when I predict a dip. Making lots of money being a traitor and outperforming hodling significantly ;)
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:39:36

@_date: 2017-09-15 12:20:32
It's not about having a crystal ball. It's about proper trading methodology - technical and fundamental analysis. Which is not all that difficult. 
I know I sold before the drop and bought below 3000. 
Not a millionaire. Working on it, though :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:06:24
Never make a trading decision that isn't backed up by proper fundamental and technical analysis. 
That includes hodling. 
Trading without proper analysis is juggling with knives, basically. 
(And no, I'm not going to tell you how to analyse investments. There are more approaches to this than there are traders. Most approaches using proper methodology, such as backtesting, significantly outperform hodling). 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:27:40

Technical analysis, performed with proper methodology - backtesting - beats hodling. It's not too hard to profit with trading in a bear market. You can't do that with hodling, though. 
I say this even though I, right now, benefit from people hodling.

Backtesting is what it's all about. Formulate strategies, and test them on historical data. Only strategies that work on historical data and that outperform hodling are valid. If you don't backtest, you're not a trader. 
It's important to use as much historical data as possible. Kraken is good, but it only goes back to 2013. Bitstamp is better. 
Eine der simpelsten Strategien die hodling um ein x-faches schlagen ist das Folgen vom wöchentlichen Moving Average von 5 Wochen. Wenn der MA5 rauf geht, kaufen, wenn der MA5 runter geht, verkaufen. 
Also, don't trust random internet guys who give you trading advice ;) backtest every strategy prior to putting it to use. If you don't backtest, you're not a trader. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:30:41

I don't *know*. My technical analysis tools, which are more often right than not (65/35), tell me it's likely we'll see a second drop, which isn't at all the same thing as knowing. Analysis isn't prediction :)

Earning quite a bit of money timing the money.

True. The millionaires sold *before* the announcement, and they're buying now.

I have zero doubt that Bitcoin will, with absolute certainty, lose 99% of its value in the next 2 minutes.

Bitcoin infrastructure disappearing into nowhere, a very high number of people and businesses on this earth being unable to use bitcoin, when they were before, is a good thing? Please explain how. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:49:49
I agree! Please let me know what methods you use for generating testable predictions for trading bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:34:19
I bought around 2995 (slightly above weekly MA9 deviation line -1) on 2017-09-15 and sold around 4030 (weekly MA5) on 2017-09-18. I'm hoping to buy at weekly MA9 Devline -1 again, around 3100, this time. We'll see if it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:44:53
There's a whole lot of a very profitable middle ground between "hodling" and "day trading". 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:49:51
Very easy, if one uses proper trading methodology. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:38:28
Trading is much more interesting :)
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:23:15
Nothing wrong with that. I earn a living by taking money from panic sellers ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:25:01
Why do you think so many people around here tell other people to hodl? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:59:20
Hey, I don't judge. You can do anything you like with your bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:53:25
Depends on the investment horizon, really. We've had all time highs very recently.

@_date: 2017-09-18 10:20:32
I wouldn't be at all surprised if we go to or near ~3200 once more this week, but I'm not betting money on it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:20:44
I don't short as a rule. 
Why would I want to prove anything? Why would I care what people on reddit, of all places, think about me?
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:37:57
I don't believe in static support lines. Weekly moving average - standard deviation. I think it's likely we'll reach MA9 Dev line -1 soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:23:25
Well, that's why they're selling now :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:08:40
Too early. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:43:52
Your loss!
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:17:22
It's a skill like any other; a skill that can (and should, if one wants to earn money by trading) be practiced and learned. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:18:15
I don't short as a rule. If I shorted, I'd profit from people selling, not holding. 
You obviously care, otherwise you wouldn't have responded :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:04:26
Overtrading is a common newbie mistake. Swing trading is where it's at. Weekly chart. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:29:14
Yeah, because this is Serious Business. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:53:14
Price-wise? Probably range-bound, for some time. 
Things will definitely remain interesting :)
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:02:30
I could be wrong, of course, but I don't see us hitting 4000 today. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:12:05
Most people who trade bitcoin have seen far, FAR worse. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:05:23
I hope so!

True. The millionaires sold *before* the announcement, and they're buying now.

Bitcoin millionaires have cashed out a long time ago. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:38:06
I bought at a value I calculated based on backtesting and live executing a strategy that has been very profitable. I will sell at a value that I calculated based on the same principle. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:46:36
There's no exit point. I trade as long as it's profitable. 
I have made calculations as to how much money the wife and me will spend during the rest of our days. My calculations are as accurate as possible, which is to say, not accurate at all. I have taken into account things like life expectancy, inflation, standard of living and the like, but if my net worth is to ever reach this sum (a sum that goes down as we get older), I don't stop trading. The number is dodgy at best, the calculations are using variables that are difficult to quantify, even with a non-insane risk premium, and there are so many things that are impossible to predict. 
I trade as long as it's profitable. Anything else would be reckless. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:47:53
There are people who have much to gain by influencing people's price sentiments. 
I personally think that reddit's influence on price is very small, but it might still be a thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:59:18
It's pretty funny to read all kinds of really absurd things people around here seem to believe about how trading works. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:40:07
Been supporting my family for two years trading all kinds of stuff, including bitcoin. 
It's very easy to come up with strategies that outperform hodling. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:20:33
The constant HODL memes are .. amusing, at this point. In a "when, not if, we have a bear market again, I'll definitely point and laugh because I will have cashed out long ago and you'll get poorer and poorer in the mid-term" kind of way. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:03:22
I also have a day job. Holding is too risky in the long term and not profitable enough in the short/mid term for me. I do swing-trading, meaning, roughly around one trade every month as of now. 
There is a very profitable middle ground between the extreme points of "holding" and "day trading". 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:37:52
Have you actually read his/her post? Have you seen the trades mentioned? Have you backtested the strategy? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:22:52
I think it's a little early to buy. If I was to buy, I'd go long right now with 1/4 of my portfolio and try to catch a lower deviation line with the rest of the money. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:43:11
And yet there are analysts who make lots and lots of money outperforming hodling significantly. 
It's not that hard. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:47:25
Huge amounts of infrastructure of bitcoin disappearing, a very high number of people unable to buy bitcoin - that's good?

Bitcoin has crazy volatility. Considerable price jumps are the norm, not the exception. It's a trader's paradise. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:22:41
Judging by the quality of many comments and posts, the 0-13 option should be far more popular than it is ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:48:19

This crash is different in that the potential for a bounce after the crash is significantly diminished - Chinese, who used to make up a significant amount of trading volume, can't buy without exchanges.

It's not about having a crystal ball. It's about proper trading methodology - technical and fundamental analysis. Which is not all that difficult. 
I know I sold before the drop and bought below 3000. 
Not a millionaire. Working on it, though :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:59:53
I agree that this is a problem. Luckily, the Japanese government is much more supportive of Bitcoin than the Chinese one.

It's a possibility. I don't think we're out of the woods yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:39:25
My sympathies. 
Just wondering, what was your reasoning for buying so close to an all time high? Honest question. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:41:31
Much of the rhetoric concerning scaling in r/bitcoin is way overblown and using language that doesn't in any way help the cause of bitcoin. R/bitcoin is a factor in keeping people away from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:29:18

Yeah, this really isn't a consequence of the activation of segwit (yet), this is spammers having quit spamming, and hashpower increasing faster than difficulty follows.

Oh, I don't just trade bitcoin. This is my job; how I feed my family. 
I obviously take into account exchange fees when backtesting, but they don't matter all too much. When it comes to bitcoin, I do swing trading - one trade per month on average since 2013.

Earning money by way of hodling takes a lot more luck ( = is more risky) than earning money by way of trading.

You say that as if it was a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:25:18
Trading (Swing trading. No idea why whenever someone around here sees "trading", they read "day trading"), using proper methodology, is less risky than hodling. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:35:48
Most traders don't use proper trading methodology such as backtesting. Most traders who use proper trading methodology are successful.

Never make a trading decision that isn't backed up by proper fundamental and technical analysis. 
That includes hodling. 
Trading without proper analysis is juggling with knives, basically. 
(And no, I'm not going to tell you how to analyse investments. There are more approaches to this than there are traders. Most approaches using proper methodology, such as backtesting, significantly outperform hodling). 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:33:13
It doesn't work like that. I'll buy when the conditions of an uptrend are present. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:31:58


@_date: 2018-04-11 06:50:16
No great insight or anything like that. I just use technical analysis. Anyone can learn it. It takes book learning, practice and hard work. Which is nothing special at all, but beyond most people who post here. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:57:53
Risk management is a huge part of technical analysis. If you don't know how to do risk management, you're not a technical analyst.

Also, hey. Learn how trading works. When you trade something, you don't always have it, do you? Because then you'd hold it, not trade it.

First quarter of 2018 has not been bad, trading-wise. Volatility is good. Direction hardly relevant. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:18:54
It's a community of (mostly) people who hold bitcoin, are in shock of the uptrend being *gasp* over, as if there was no way that could have happened, as if this has never happened before in the history of bitcoin. They need constant positive reinforcement, otherwise they'd have to face the fact that actual traders who actually understand how actual technical analysis works are, right now, earning the money they're losing. 
It's kinda fun to watch. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:01:31
I think it's pretty sad, yes. I mean, all these huge losses so many people are making (not me, I know how to trade) could have been avoided by a little basic Dow theory. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:04:56
I hope we'll soon break below the February low and start an actual downtrend. Prices in the 1500-2000 range would be nice. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:50:56
Kraken? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:57:06
Have you ever tried to inform yourself as to what "resistance" actually means? Research helps. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:09:37
The agreement is a stalling tactic. Continue with signalling/converting to BIP148.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:13:37
Reads like desperate justification not to sell despite the signs of the times. "Let's ignore the downtrend and keep holding, in 10 years we'll be rich!". Good luck with that. I preferred selling in January. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:26:39
So what's going on here? Core developers are discussing adding BIP148 to Bitcoin Core - am I getting this right?
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:01:44
Respectfully, this argument works the other way too - how do we determine if support is sufficient? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:05:45
At this point I wonder if holders are just bitter they're losing all their money to traders. 
This is bitcoin. You've been warned about the dangers of investing, many times, and by pretty much everyone.

It might be best to be very careful with trading on tomorrow on sunday when BIP91 locks in. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:29:49
They're still signalling BIP141 segwit, which is ok. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:11:51
nothing new, they have signalled segwit before. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:13:07
So once BIP91 is locked in .. what happens if the majority of miners refuses to signal BIP141?
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:13:38
Thanks for your response, it's appreciated! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:10:02
The focus on price is because 99,9% of all people who post here are in it to get rich.

Been making quite a bit of xbt doing exactly that ;)
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:24:59
Oh sure, happens occasionally, but the net profit is still a very nice one :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:22:01
Please explain. 
The way I see it, BIP91 activates --&gt; blocks that don't signal BIP141, which could well be a whole lot, especially considering Jihan's recent twitter, are orphaned --&gt; chain split. 
I might have been misinformed on these facts. Please explain. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:40:38
Not my understanding. 
Quote: "Upon activation of BIP91, all BIP91 nodes will reject any blocks that do not signal support for SegWit through bit 1"
More than 50% of hashpower doesn't support BIP141 (bit 1 segwit). Am I the only one who sees this as a problem? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:38:45
This is really dangerous, and you shouldn't do this. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:29:35
I wonder, *if* BIP91 locks in, if/when they'll start signalling BIP141. Their blocks will be orphaned otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:50:13
Yeah, well, I agree with your opinion, but I was asking for actual factual information as to why F2Pool stopped signalling for NYA. As in, have they made an announcement explaining their reasons? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:46:14
Not everyone, no. 
Hodlers, traders and users, though? Definitely :)
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:28:56
It's really not over. It's over once BIP141 segwit is locked in. It's looking good so far, but quite a few things could still go wrong. 
People could increase our chances by running BIP148 nodes. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:41:46
Not yet, but moving in the right direction. We're out of the woods once BIP141 segwit has locked in in August. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:37:21
My opinion? Easy. Get miners to signal for Segwit, right now. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:40:10
anyone know why he stopped signalling for NYA? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:21:48
No. They're still signalling for BIP141 to lock in. It's relevant once BIP141 has been activated.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:46:36
uninstalled bitcoin-qt, installed the new bitcoin-qt, looks like it's working fine - my old block files are still there and it looks like the node could access them just fine. Thanks for the assistance! 
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:39:19
the last bit, the "2" means signalling for segwit (BIP141). 
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:23:05
I myself would like to go long on bitcoin, but I'm definitely not going to do so until we know that the activation of BIP91 hasn't caused any issues. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:54:42
The last couple weeks since the ATH have been very profitable for me. Technical analysis quite simply works (if you use it right. If you fail to do basic stuff such as backtesting strategies you're not using technical analysis and you deserve to lose money). 
Reading comments around here makes me think very few care to know or understand how technical analysis works. It's kinda amusing. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:37:29
To keep miners honest. We don't know if miners are still enforcing BIP91 and signalling BIP141 in the next activation period of BIP141. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:01:11
"Support seems huge"? 
Based on what? 
Not intended as criticism, but a honest question, from someone who's very invested in seeing UASF work. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:08:52
I don't consider the possibility of a chain split to be that meaningless, personally. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:42:45
what kind of POW change? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:39:59
Don't see Bixin signalling Segwit as of yet. As of now, I only believe that sort of thing when I see it. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:48:38
Makes sense, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:39:37
Is there a specific reason as for why we're NOT also counting the hashpower that's signalling Segwit? Please explain, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:22:39
I wonder how the exchanges are going to handle this - it's up to them which Bitcoin will be the real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:22:13
Jihan is definitely long on Eth.
