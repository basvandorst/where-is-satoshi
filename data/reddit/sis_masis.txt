Hopefully we'll be back in bull market in a few weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:41:11
I know, hence my careful wording of "in your opinion" :)

Which ones allow the purchase with fiat?

What’s the bitcoin anthem? Guys?

What are we looking at for withdrawal fees? As crazy as Binance?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:35:32
So is this similar to what we saw at the end of 2013 and throughout 2014 and 2015? Is that the kind of bear market we are going into in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:28:54
Any particular reason for this?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:21:55
That's not good news at all.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:31:11
Not if it drops below the price I or others invested into BTC...
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:19:08
EDIT: I stand corrected. Looks like there is a way.

What is that link? Doesn't work.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:29:03
Oh don't say that...
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:38
So by volume he means the volume of people buying bitcoin will go up, and not the volume of bitcoins sold. Correct?

When I login to my Ledger Nano S, it asks me which chain I want to use, legacy or segwit. Why do we have the legacy option when segwit was activated and can you transfer from legacy to segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:42:16
I don’t understand most of the things he says...what’s shorting, what’s the volume, what will the price do?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:35:43
What does he mean by “We are going to see a lot of volume in bitcoin”?
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:49:52
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:37:26
This is perfect!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:37
I think you pay them interest. But don’t quote me on it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:03
Hahaha this made it even more confusing. Sorry, I am just not getting it..
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:56:33
And what a wild ride it was. I am strapped in, ready for more.

Well said.

When is one a veteran hodler? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:20:30
This is what I don’t get. The idea of Bitcoin is to operate without the need for middlemen, i.e. banks. So, now we have companies like Coinbase which basically are the banks in the crypto world? 
Anyone care to explain me this? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:04
That explains a lot. Thanks.
And I just realized I asked the questions "Why would I lend it to someone else and get less back" a few times already :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:24:36
Do explain what you mean.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:07
So I own 1 stock worth $100. Why would I lend it to anyone and only receive $75 back? What do I as a lender get out of this? If I keep my 1 stock and the price drops to $75, I will still have 1 stock, although now it's worth $75. Isn't this the same as getting $75 back from the borrower?


This is what confuses me most. How do you know when to buy back? And how can you be certain you can buy back at $75?
Also what if you decide not to buy back or buy at say $10? This means you took my stock, made money out it and I am getting less back. What would be my incentive to lend my stock to anyone else? I might as well sell it myself at $100 and buy back at $75.
And how does this all work with btc. Say I have 1 btc. Why would I lend it to anyone else. Lose money and have someone else profit of off my btc?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:59:00
Damn, I must be a legendary veteran then.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:12
But who do you owe it to? Shorting is another term of margin trading?

But but but it went from a few cents to a few thousand dollar...

How is banks buying Bitcoin a great thing? Wasn’t Bitcoin created to move away from central organizations and put the power back in the hands of the people?
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:22:59
Get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:29:47
True. Then get a paper wallet.

He replied to OP's comment.
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:55:42
Serious question, why would we need bitcoin ATMs when your phone or hardware wallet is all you need for transactions?
What exactly does a Bitcoin ATM do?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:54:09
But isn’t the whole point of cryptocurrency to get rid of money as we know it today?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:15:55
You suck!
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:15:01
Listen to this guy! DIP DAMN IT.
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:28:38
How much more? I mean, it won't go below 2000 again, will it?
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:30:54
Come on!!! I want moar.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:27:12

Should have bought 2 days ago, damn it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:49:40
Did you turn on the pirate font on your phone?
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:35:23
Noooo, need moar at low prices
