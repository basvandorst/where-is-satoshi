That's kind of my plan too. The volume of doge being traded is huge.

Doesn't mean we can't keep discussing it...

I understand your frustration. Keep in mind how young these sites like coinbase are. There is a lot we don't know about them and how they are going to work. They are more a transition to a pure bitcoin market where these sorts of problems will go away when you no longer need to convert bitcoin to USD.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:50:01
Exactly, they aren't in the buisness of day trades. They just want to help people convert fiat to bitcoins. The make their money on transaction fees. No need to lose money on risky day trades.
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:50:34
You have to keep on mind that the price is only dropping because the supply of doge increases so quickly too.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:58:17
There are currencies with faster transaction rates. A second currency will most likely rise to meet this demand.
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:32:58
Ironically, this will probably drive the price downwards for a while.

The btc market is still a thin market and no one really knows what it should be valued at. Assuming it can gain enough liquidity it would make a great store of wealth. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:00:27
Never going to happen. Google just wants people to start using google wallet. Also, if someone wants bitcoin tips they can just write an address in the description.

Its actually really easy to mistake bitcoin for a ponzi scheme if you don't understand the underlying technology. But bitcoin actually does and will provide an increasingly valuable service and the miners are actually an integrel part to keeping that service secure and running. 
Bitcoin as far as I know is the first decentralized public ledger ever created. Imagine a giant public board where anyone can write on any time yet everyone can trust what is written is accurate without having to trust a middleman or stand there all the time double checking every other person. 
Imagine being able to verify that a bank has the money it says it does imagine being able to hold a government or politician accountable to where their funds are going and coming from by simply looking at this public ledger. 
The concept that we now have a global self-checking decentralized archive/communication tool available to us still blows my mind. So much so that I still haven't been able to come up with a good descriptor. 
The fact that some people are making a ton of money off of bitcoin now is nearly a symptom of its growth in popularity. Bitcoin is however not meant to make a population wealthy. It is meant to empower a people to fight corruption that always plagues those who control centralized currencies. The protocol of bitcoin willl inevitably be used for more interesting and novel things than simply keeping track of coins in an address.

How is this different than bittorent?
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:03:19
This will not be a prime time internet. It would be way to slow. But I could see it being a good darknet.
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:56:47
I think he means that, anyone can be a BTC node or solve a BTC block.  But there are only 9 people who can be this authority for tor.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:08:13
I'd love for them to hit the exchange. Would drive the price down and I could pick some up.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:11:00
Bitcoin is at the point where merchant adoption and services are going to drive growth not being nice to newbes
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:08:22
So popcorn time?
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:01:47
This post a misses the fact that tiger direct is converting btc to USD. Spending bitcoin in this way naturally drives the price down. So the good news is probably countered by an increased pressure on the market by additional sellers.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:34:30
I think being nice to newbies is important too, I just don't think it is what is going to drive adoption at this point.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:00:15
Dollars = thick market. BTC = thin market. You obviously dont understand the risk as well as you thought.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:37:07
haha, I'd be ok with that
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:54:50
Because the price is artificially high since there are not a lot of people selling. As people start to buy things/sell them, more come into circulation and the price will drop. 
This is doubly so since tigerdircect will use a service like  canvas or bitpay, which sells coins at market price immediately. So they will only be worth what people are willing to pay. If people aren't buying them, they lower the price so they can make their money. ie. bitcoin is still not very liquid.
I would expect a short term drop, as the supply starts to adjust to demand. Then a gradual increase as awarness for the coins increases.

I'm not arguing with someone who thinks all regulation is bad am I?
I just don't see that the benefits of high frequency trading outweigh the negatives. Most companies probably don't want to deal with it either, they just have no choice because other companies are.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:30:39
Do you not realize that it isn't single people that are high frequency traders, but massive companies and hedge funds...
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:41:55
Its not about sticking it to the man, its about slowing down high-frequency trading. Think of it as someone who is skating around wildly bumping into all of the other skaters and knocking them over, so you tighten the bearings on his skates so now they have to skate slower. They are still out of control, but at least people can see them coming and get out of the way.
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:59:33
Well, no one cares if two people trade with each other. People start to care when two massive hedge funds begin trading with enough power to move entire markets in fractions of a second. 
And no, when they lose its not just their money, its everyone's collective money. People are stupid, companies are stupider. That is why regulations exists, to make it so people and companies don't have to do stupid things to compete. 
The only reason we have a stock market is to create liquidity in the market and raise capitol for future ventures. High frequency trading is just a dangerous side chain. No more than a leach which has been allowed to grow too large.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:02:28
I was really hoping you had put 1 dollar worth of bitcoin in 4 years ago :P
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:12:09
No need for escrow, just trusted sellers.
@_date: 2015-02-26 23:37:37
That article didn't really offer any concrete evidence to back up their claims, just a bunch of hacked together arguments.

Environmental regulation has made things better.

It was the jailbreak. Thats known to be malicious.

Ever since I heard about bitcoin all I've want was to own a whole one.after the drop to $600 I bout and now i've got .25 bitcoins. Almost there :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:15:21
That was awesome thank you. This is the reason some altcoins will exist. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:43:58
Same all I want is one bitcoin. Going to have to settle for .25 bitcoins :(
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:36:01
Moto x my friend. You will never look back.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:17:01
No one understood derivative trading. Que the crash of 2008.

I love walking into a casino with 100 to lose. I have to leave any means of getting money out of my account at home though because once I get that itch its hard to stop.
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:25:34
Banks are instrumental in creating liquidity and managing long term risks. There will always be a bank even if bitcoins take over. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:31:42
Thats awesome I had no idea! How often does it update?
