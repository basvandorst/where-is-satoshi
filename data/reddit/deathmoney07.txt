Sorry if this is stupid but, in my defense as a complete noob to bitcoin - what is the difference between the two (Bitcoin, mBTC, Satoshi's)? Thanks.

I just finally got this reponse via email - I had to actually find their support email via their twitter:
I apologize for the lack of service. We were in the process of archiving our database and the server crashed. We have performed all necessary restoration procedures and no data was lost. We appreciate your patience and if have questions or concerns please feel free to send us additional email. Apologies again for the inconvenience.
edit: Also, to your note - that is very concerning. I wish my trezor would hurry and get here.

I don't have a large amount but, I still want to be as secure as possible. How do you back up a Trezor and why would you "back it up? Are we talking about this in comparison to how you would back up a hard drive? Sorry for the dumb questions, big noob here but trying to learn. Thanks!

I use a case wallet - is that sufficient enough, or no?

Should I split my BTC/BCH before this hardfork happens in November? I've had my BTC stored on my ledger for a while, and have not even gone through the process to separate my BCH from BTC since the August 1st fork.
If yes - should I keep my BTC on legacy, or segwit? I'm so lost on how to proceed. Thanks for any help.
