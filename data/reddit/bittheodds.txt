Another upvote for Bitstamp, so far these guys have been really professional and responsive when I dealt with them. Didn't seem many negative stories about them either.
Do however note that they are not validating their users like mtgox does. This could spell trouble in the medium term if Anti Money Laundering regulations catch up with them, or in the short term if their account rings warning bells at their bank. For example, a criminal could try to push funds from stolen accounts to their in order to launder the cash. That would be game over very quickly if they didn't cover their bases with the relevant authorities (Slovenia if I'm not mistaken)

Hello therabyte! Actually what you're describing has been done before. Gridfinity, and many other companies tried the model of commercial distributed computing both on CPUs and GPUs in the past. I even remember a model where the computation was distributed via a web app (java applet if my memory serves me well).
The issue they faced (and what subsequently led to their closure), is that they couldn't find customers to process data for. There are two main reasons for this:
* Commercial, not scientific data crunching is I/O bound, not CPU bound. a) In fact proportionally very little work is suitable to the grid model - what consumer intelligence companies really need aren't CPU cycles, but more spindles. b) even if it could be done, the drives with 1TB plates, the slow load times (even over fiber) you'd find in consumer level environments would be anything but useless for this type of heavy duty crunching anyway. In short, it would be cheaper to go buy a SAN from EMC than attempt to go through a distributed computing provider.
* Second, the customers data and their matching algorithms are companies' crown jewels nowadays. a) While you could somehow, on very specific type of unstructured, scientific data be able to obscure (but not completely) the meaning of the said data, it would be impossible to protect 'more traditional', granular data. That's a huge no-no. And b) the algos would have to be distributed on each machine, and needless to say couldn't be protected either from snooping and reverse engineering, period.
Finally, there's the whole issue of rogue clients injecting bad results, as well as vulnerabilities to organised attacks, making the whole process requiring multiple - to draw a parallel with bitcoin - 'proof of work', making the whole thing even less suitable for commercial purposes.
TL;DR: already been tried many times before, didn't work for reasons explained above.

Thank you xrandr, it appears I was mistaken about this. 
A bit of background, ideas were bounced on the official mailing list ( then it got pushed into bitcoinJ, which led to some discussing it on IRC as an established fact, when it wasn't. 
That said, there's no real 'roadmap' for QT, in the end it's an open source project, so someone might come up with an implementation and it might be accepted.
I quite like the idea of an hybrid client myself, starting as SPV, then moving on to 'full' as resources allow.

From the page: "*With a direct wallet-to-wallet transfer you’ll need to wait around for at least a few of the 6 confirmations to go through.*"
Why is that? Finley, Brute Force and &gt;50% attacks are very hard to pull off and probably not worth the few hundreds you could steal in a face to face cash transaction. 
Are you trying to protect yourself from race attacks then? Couldn't this be mitigated by disabling incoming connections on your bitcoind?

Hi OP, there are currently two views regarding this:
**In the 'Yes' camp**, argument cited include:
* that at a level of transaction equivalent to one of the major processors such as MasterCard, a purchase of a 3TB hardrive would be required every 21 days in order to keep up with the blockchain. 
* that the rise of SPV clients (see below) would lead to the formation of 'super nodes' controlled by the few, potentially including organisations like VISA or Paypal seeing an opportunity to limit or even sabotage Bitcoin.
* that the blockchain is already too large, citing the issues the Armory client had recently and continues to have.
**In the 'No' camp**,  the argument is ~~that the official bitcoin client is switching to SPV (Simplified Payment Verification), just like other wallets such as Electrum already do today~~ This reduces the local disk space required to near 0. As for the rise of 'super nodes', some have cited methods to control that no shenanigans could take place, which have been debated and aren't part of the official client just yet. 
EDIT: was about to paste that link from the official wiki, but Sorillo beat me to it :)
EDIT: the bitcoinQT client is 'unlikely' to switch to SPV, I stand corrected - see my reply to xrandr below. Thank you xrandr for picking that one up.

This will probably come at little consolation, but try to put more RAM in your machine, even temporarily by borrowing some from a friend. At this point in time Armory is unstable if you have less than 6GB of ram on Windows. 
Have you tried posting on:  ?
For those that don't know about the issues Armory is facing: 
TL;DR: Poor design decisions + the blockchain grew too fast.

@_date: 2013-05-13 20:47:57
I think another way to think about it, is to turn the problem on its head, and try to calculate how long it would take to generate a public/private key combination identical to one that already exists.
This is a common (and fair) question from newbies which I think illustrates the point even better as it doesn't involve 'cracking' anything, but instead keep generating addresses until you get lucky.
This excellent post on stackoverflow ( explains it quite well:
*"In order to spend money sent to a Bitcoin address, you just need to find a ECDSA public key that hashes to the same 160 bit value. That will take, on average, 2 ^ 160 key generations.*
*Supposing you could generate a billion (2 ^ 30) per second, you need 2 ^ 130 seconds.*
*Doing this in parallel using a billion machines requires only 2 ^ 100 seconds.*
*Getting a billion of your richest friends to join you gets it down to only 2 ^ 70 seconds.*
*There are about 2 ^ 25 seconds per year, so you need 2 ^ 45 years.*
*The age of the Universe is about 2 ^ 34 years so far—better get cracking!"*
If it was necessary to explain it futher, there's always this quote from the bitcointalk forum: "If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would currently take 2^126 times longer to generate a colliding bitcoin address than to generate a block.  You could have got a lot more money by generating blocks."

Hey Satoshiforpresident (cool nick by the way). I think what riplin means is that anyone with enough coins to affect market price downwards upon selling would not sell all in one go. Never mind 1M coins. 
The way you'd do it (and you don't have to be satoshi to do this), is by observing buy walls, sell enough to consume the wall, rinse, wash, repeat. This way you'd get considerably more money out of the system.

Hello, here's an easier way: a bitcoin address is just 20 bytes of data. Any 20 bytes will do, even though usually that's derived from a hash. 
Therefore, you don't need to do the whole '001 represents x' thing, you can just push text to the blockchain as long as you are happy with the trx costs.

Hello D9-thc, I'll reply to this properly as I can see you are using a 'real' account.
I'm very conflicted about your post. On one hand, it's interesting, and I wasn't aware of this book. On the other, you inserted a page in the PDF including a donation link. Begging is not allowed on this subreddit. Furthermore, you do not own the rights to the work you posted and clearly scanned it from the Middlesex University Library, and that's a bit naughty.
Anyway, my take is that:
- The book posted was published : 1 July 2001
- The first reference to symmetric proof-of-work function was Hashcash in May 1997, via the  cypherpunks mailing-list discussions.
- Wei Dai's B-money ( is the first proposal considered to be a precursor to bitcoin, dated 1998, published on the aforementioned mailing lists.
I don't have enough time to peruse the book in question, however it would be interesting to see how much of it is based on the work above.

Hello Davispuh, funny enough I was just about to post the exact same thing, with the same links. I also find it very odd and disconcerting - people with 2FA on complaining of disappearing coins. I just don't see how accounts with 2FA could get hacked that easily, without someone having cloned their SIMs if authenticating via text, or having managed to crack the google authenticator app (a tall order!).
That said, I think there are mitigating factors: 
* The /gonewild chick seems to have had an API key added to her gox account before 2FA was put in place, so we can discard that one. Probably spear fishing considering she has such a public profile.
* The german chap asking for help on analysing the suspicious transactions never reported back as to what he discovered on his friend's computer, ie, could have been the fake bitcoinQT client at work.
* The other 3 didn't mention 2FA, and could have been victims of windows keyloggers or malware, which is not uncommon. 
Either way, it is a good reminder to keep one's wallet safe!
TL;DR: the jury is still out as to what exactly happened in all these cases

- It doesn't say what the 'major events' the notifications will appear for. Would be great to be able to configure them, i.e., price falls by more than x% in x hours, etc.

Hi Jojo_bacon, 
First, you make me feel a bit old, because my son is 14 and I sure don't see myself as qualifying to be an 'older' parent :) 
Second, it's awesome you are interested in bitcoin. What a great way to get introduced to fairly complex concepts such as inflation, as well as current financial events.
If you want you parents to use bitcoin, it has to be interesting to them. I can think of two possibilities:
1) They could see it as a financial investment,
2) They might want to buy something with it
Depending on how confortable your parents are with new technology,  might be a bit tricky as there's not much you can buy with bitcoin you can't already buy with pre-existing payment methods.
So investing a bit could be a cool thing to do with your parents.
Do you know if they are putting a bit of money each month on a saving account for you? It's a common thing parents do to put their kids in college, etc.  
If it's the case and it's something they already talked about with you (maybe they prompted you to save a bit of money as well every month), then just explain that you indeed think it's great to save for the future, and that since you are interested in learning more about finance, you'd like to 'diversify' your savings. 
Well, I for one would be amazed if my son came up to me with that idea and would definitely be paying attention at that point :)
Then, proceed to explain you'd like to put a percentage of your saving into this thing called bitcoin. It's important that you make sure you convey to them that you understand that it's a risky investment, because it's your big opportunity to explain to them WHY you think bitcoin is great. 
For example, you could talk about what makes bitcoin special: 0 transaction fees for merchant, no possibility of charge backs, a convenient to pay with your phone. 
If they think its interesting (I would), tell them you know how to place say, 10% of what they give you each month into a bitcoin wallet. I suggest you do all this with them, going on Gox, signing them up etc.
I can assure you that if you go that far, and your savings in bitcoin climb by say, 5% or more in the next few months, your parents are definitely going to pay attention, because their existing saving accounts don't return anywhere near that. I think you'll find that they might even want to invest in bitcoin themselves when it's all said and done :)
Good luck and have fun :)

I don't know. Being an avid gambler myself as well as someone developing a betting platform, I can tell you that the so called 'Monte Carlo fallacy' ( is a very potent thing indeed.
Take a true, hardware-based RNG and flip a virtual coin 10,000,000 times, and you're sure to find 'heads' or 'tails' appearing in sequence for dozens if not hundreds of times in a row. I bet (pun intended) that if players were to be gambling martingale during such a sequence they would be up in arms as to how 'flipping tails 40 times in a row is a statistical anomaly' and how the site owner is a crook. 
Furthermore, casinos make good profits without having to rig the system. It would be incredibly complex to develop an algorithm that somehow affects the outcome of various games based on player balance without getting caught very rapidly, online or offline. 
As for the story around 'cashout then put your money back in so they'll think you're a new player', if I had a penny for every time I heard it... IRL you can see little old ladies breaking bills manually at the counter before putting it back in the same slot machine because they fear the 'system is tracking them'. It's not. 
Finally, I believe that Bitzino is also provably fair, so to cheat that, too, would cost exponentially more in engineering (if it's even possible) than its worth. And again, they would get busted, fast.
As for people 'losing their savings' on Bitzino and other sites, that's more to do with gambling irresponsibly. You should only gamble money you can afford to lose. For example, as I said I'm a gambler, so I'm going to Vegas again in a couple of days, and I've set a firm budget of 'play' money. Anything else - chasing losses in particular - is asking for trouble.
That's not to say cheating doesn't ever happen - collusion at tables or hacking by third parties comes to mind - but in order to demonstrate this, a digital record of all logs that can be analysed would be infinitely more useful than videos, which even if you publish them won't mean much to anyone.

As someone who is both an avid gambler and developing a gambling app, this saddens me greatly. 
I think everyone on this thread did a great job at giving the OP some advice, so I won't. I'll just share a thought:
Gambling is meant to be fun. It can't possibly be fun to gamble money that you somehow need for something else, or can't afford to lose. 
Some people enjoy the intellectual stimulation of poker, others the flashy colours and sounds of slots. Personally I love both, but I always made a point to go to a betting place with a certain amount of cash on me, defined in advance. Once that cash is gone, it's home time. 
I think of it as 'fun money'. You spend say, 50 bucks for a AAA game title that last 8 hours. 20 bucks for a 2h blockbuster movie. When I gamble, I think 'how much am I willing to spend for a few hours of entertainment?'.
TL;DR: budgeting a gambling envelop does not remove the thrill from the game, but it does remove the risk to one's mental and financial health.
