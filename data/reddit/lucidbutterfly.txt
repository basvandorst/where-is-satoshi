Again, thanks for the helpful response!


Ok - that make a lot of sense.  Since it's kind of a investment/currency hybrid, it gets really confusing to me


I moved it to a wallet from coinbase, based a on suggestion from a thread on here and then promptly spent it.  So, on my .001 BTC purchase, I think I lost a couple cents.
I never realized how confusing this whole process can be - it will be very interesting over the next couple years watching how laws shape the way the BTC is tracked and taxed.

Ok-thank you!  I did purchase from Coinbase.  I have no problem with the delay, I just was scared I did something wrong. I'm exciting to get more into it, but I wanted to start small.

Whoa - awesome, I'm going to figure this out and collect it.  Thanks!!

Thanks for your helpful answer!
I can see how this could be a good investment tool as a part of a balanced portfolio, but I can't imagine how this could be practical as a currency.
For example, it took 4 business days to get the bitcoin into my account (when purchased through coinbase.)  Now, I have to track all fluctuations in the price and be concerned with being audited, plus the stigma that some of the purchases with BTC are done for nefarious purposes.  As a person who just wanted to buy an SSD on newegg it's so incredibly impractical I don't understand why people would use it.
It's like trying to purchase good by paying with stocks.
But, people do use it - what am I missing?!

Wow - thank you for the awesome response.  I feel much better about it now.
It blows my mind that the banking system is so incredibly slow at this day in age.  One would think something like that should happen almost instantaneously with how fast the computers and networks are getting.

I purchased it from Coinbase after connecting my banking information.  I didn't know if it had something to do with my bank, or if all  purchases took that long.

I just bought my first .1 BTC.  Does it always take 4 business days to get into my account, or did I do something stupid?
