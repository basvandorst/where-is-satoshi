You need to check the prices yourself friend. Maybe use coinmarket cap, click btc, then markets to find an approximate price for the exchanges you mentioned. Generally, the major coins on major exchanges are similarly priced

At any time banks, governments, Visa etc can freeze your money or confiscate it if they think you’ve done something wrong. They can also just take it if they’ve failed to do their jobs properly ala in Greece

Not quite invisible. If anything it’s very visible. Anyone with an internet connection can see your incoming/outgoing transactions. It’s only if they can link your identity to an address

Is it that if the new fork sends to say a bch address, they will lose their coin rather than it bouncing back?

My understanding is that it’s a bit of a regulatory nightmare for them at the moment to accept crypto.

In this context it’s spelt ‘phishing’....unless it’s an actual fishing site that accepts crypto?

If you go all at once, you’re buying a big amount at an all time high. If the price drops, you’ll be pretty upset. Whereas if you buy small and wait, it might go down and you buy more/get better rate

You need to sleep outside the bitcoin store for a few nights ala new iPhones. 
Just don’t drop it when u get it [like this guy](

I don’t think it’s ever dropped 90%? Happy to stand corrected

It works both ways mate. Could drop by 50%. Has before

They’re mostly all still successful at doing what they were designed to do. They didn’t fail.

Why would they even need to go to HK? Just vpn. Have a feeling most Vpn buyers are Chinese anyway due to great firewall

Think OP was referring to those early adopters who mined/bought some. Then thinking it was worthless, dumped their computer. Likely

1:1 btc to bch, btg. Don’t know about the others.
Do you only keep money in the bank as it increases in principle? If so you’re much better having it invested elsewhere.
You can find out all the staking of other coins/tokens yourself online and using a calculator. Neo’s gas gain is quite small, SmartCash’s gain is quite large.

For some small merchants it’s an easy way for them to buy crypto and also expand their customer base a little. 
Merchant adoption is still unbelievably tiny. I went to a large city in Aus and wanted to get a bitcoin haircut - not possible

Ugh bitcoin doesn’t need to do anything. There will only ever be 21million of them. Demand is increasing. Already a bunch of coins lost due to people dying/losing keys.
As for dollar value, if u held 1 btc a few years ago, you’d be credited with bitcoin cash, gold, diamond?, private and probably others in years to come.
As for your interest question, many coins already using proof of stake(neo, phore, smartcash etc, etc) give extra coins or gas to users for simply holding their coins.
Current bank savings are actually losing you money vs inflation too so that’s another consideration
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:46:21
All these can be found online my friend

You ‘did your part’?
Thousands of developers are working, many of them free, to build and secure the future of this technology. There are Blockchain based companies trying to solve the problems in the world(poverty, oppressive governments etc).
To say you did your part by spending some money is just crazy to me.
Why don’t you donate to Wikileaks or a non profit union or open sourced project like Firefox? Then an arrogant post like yours will be treated better.
