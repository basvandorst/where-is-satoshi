Off the top of my head, I think that in typical LN channel-adjust transactions, the other side needs to know the value of the output that they're receiving, but the values of the inputs and change output can be usefully hidden.

Privacy is currently pretty poor. If you use Bitcoin Core over Tor and never reuse addresses, then you might have a little privacy, but this relies on a number of factors which are difficult to control. It typically can't be relied upon.
Ideal privacy/fungibility would be for all of the data typically available on block explorers today to be either inaccessible or meaningless/useless. Given an address, it would be impossible to see its balance, or how much / when it received BTC, or how much / when it "sent" BTC. (But it should be possible for people to provably provide this data if they want.) Furthermore, it would even be impossible to see aggregate statistics such as total BTC sent in a given period of time. This ideal might be impossible, however.
Possible improvements:
* Currently, the best-known techniques for anonymity are ring signatures + confidential transactions + stealth addresses, or Mimblewimble. The former provides very good anonymity, but the scalability is absolutely awful; the block chain size grows very quickly and can never be pruned. Mimblewimble has far better scalability (though worse than Bitcoin), but AFAICT there are potential points of weakness in the anonymity. Either or both of these approaches could be done on a Bitcoin sidechain. Unless their major scalability issues are somehow addressed, probably they will never be done on the Bitcoin main chain.
* Wallets should continuously do CoinJoin/CoinShuffle/CoinSwap in order to unlink funds. These all require either additional P2P networks or centralized matchmakers in order to function, so they're difficult.
* Lightning will improve anonymity by making most transactions off-chain and private. You can also do "onion routing" (like Tor) on Lightning to improve anonymity.

Maybe it'll shock some people into minimizing their exposure to exchanges, which is good. But obviously traders need to leave some BTC on exchanges, and in that respect I agree with you.
In the future it'll be possible to use payment channels and other smart contracts to minimize trust in exchanges without sacrificing their advantages. (BitSquare apparently sort of does this, but I've heard that it's sub-optimal in a number of ways.)

Basically, but it's better to run your own full node. See: 
(I don't think that the Trezor can directly interface with Bitcoin Core yet, so it'd be a bit complex to set up the ideal configuration today, but hopefully this will change someday.)


You'd be surprised how little checking is often done in open source software... Also, it's possible that mytrezor.com could give you a specially-prepared evil update that is different from the open source version.
It's probably reasonably safe, and I *do* very much recommend a Trezor or KeepKey rather than a software wallet for most people, but the device should really:
* Require your pin before performing the update.
* Display a hash of the update file before performing the update so that you can check online that this is the same update that everyone else is getting.

I think that that's likely. You could have a Monero-style anonymizing sidechain which is active for a year or two, but after that is programmed to become inactive and only allow sidechain-&gt;Bitcoin transactions. This largely resolves the blockchain bloat issue with ring signatures without causing anyone to lose money.
Super-smart-contracts are probably possible to do in a way that is scalable, but until that gets figured out, temporary sidechains might make sense.
I really like the idea of Bitcoin proper as an ultra-secure Swiss bank account, with other linked "account types" (=sidechains) having more features but possibly some downsides. This is really the best of all worlds.

BitPay probably just isn't going to signal RBF-enabled transactions as received until 1 confirmation.
But OP's issue once again demonstrates the futility of fighting against 0-conf replacement... If even BitPay can't prevent double-spends with RBF-*disabled* transactions, even though they put more effort in detecting double-spends than basically anyone else, then why pretend that 0-conf transactions have more than zero security? We might as well get the benefits of RBF.

I guess all the details haven't been finalized yet. It is pretty complicated.

When he said size he meant in bytes. See [here](
Probably your fee was so low that all of your peers refused to relay it. BitPay never even saw it. As others have said, the 10 minute limit is for BitPay to *see* your transaction, not for the transaction to be confirmed.
I suspect that the transactions will never confirm. You should probably delete them and resend with a higher fee, but I don't know how to do this in MultiBit off the top of my head. Also be aware that just because you delete transactions on your end doesn't meant that someone else won't keep a copy of your transaction and keep trying it. So you could theoretically find months in the future that your "deleted" transaction just got confirmed. BitBet famously went bankrupt due to a mistake like this involving a high-value transaction. The proper solution to this is to resend the transaction using at least some of the exact same low-level coin objects as the deleted transaction, which ensures that both transactions cannot both exist in the block chain. Again, I don't know how to do this in MultiBit.
If any of the transactions do confirm, you should contact BitPay for a refund. Also, at least right after Steam added Bitcoin support, I heard that they would sometimes treat a failed Bitcoin transaction like a credit card chargeback and suspend your account, but you should be able to explain the situation to them and get your account unbanned if that happens.

This sounds pretty serious. It sounds like if *either* side of a connection is affected by this bug, and an attacker knows both sides' IPs, then they can quickly confirm that a connection exists and insert whatever data they want into the middle of the connection. They can't *read* data sent between the two parties, though.
Where this is most worrying to me is system updates. On Linux, it's unfortunately fairly common for updates to be automatically delivered over HTTP and then not checked in a secure way. For example, Gentoo by default downloads packages insecurely, and on yum-based systems, even though the stock configuration is often secure, it's common to add insecure repos (for example, the official nginx repo is by default insecure). If your system downloads updates insecurely, then an attacker can maybe take over your computer by knowing just your IP address with this attack.

That shows that it's in the longest block chain, not that it's valid. Full nodes by definition check that every transaction and block is valid. Read the last paragraph in the SPV section of the paper.

They don't. The merchant has the option of choosing how many confirmations are required until an order is signaled as paid, though.

No problem. Be aware that this policy is probably not very common yet, so the new transaction still might be ignored by a lot of miners and take a long time to confirm. That's one reason why there's no UI for it yet. Once miners upgrade to 0.13.0, CPFP will start working reliably.

Yeah. I completely understand the issues that "big-blockers" have with the max block size, since I thought the same things myself. Central economic planning, restricting the free market, etc. I only hope that some of these people will stick with Bitcoin and eventually learn as I did that having a reasonable max block size is just as necessary as the 21 million BTC cap. (Though the max block size needn't be a fixed value, *maybe* not even a global value, and certainly not 1 MB forever.)


I felt pretty strongly about it. On the theory that Bitcoin should be a free-market timestamping service for the highest bidder, I was opposed to all "arbitrary" restrictions that Satoshi added: the 1 MB limit, the sigops limit, IsStandard, etc. (I now view my original theory as being wrong for a number of different reasons.) But it seemed so distant (blocks at this point rarely had more than a few dozen transactions), Satoshi asked me to lay off the issue in public, and I acknowledged that Satoshi knew far more about Bitcoin than I did, so I didn't press it.
Also, I thought (and Satoshi probably thought) that a hardfork would be almost as easy as a softfork. This probably would've been true in 2010. As you may have already seen from the link that chabes posted, I said this a few months after the 1 MB limit was added:


But now Bitcoin is *unbelievably* larger, and it no longer has a clear leader, so hardforks are a *lot* more difficult. In most ways it's good that Bitcoin is leaderless and hardforks (ie. breaking Bitcoin's rules) are very difficult, though I do hope that someday it will be possible to do at least some uncontroversial efficiency-boosting hardforks, and it's a necessary counterbalance to miners that the economy be able to hardfork to a new PoW if miners abuse their position. If 2010-me would've known that the 1 MB limit would end up being so "sticky", I might've argued a lot more vigorously about not adding it. Though if present-day-me went back in time, I'd probably argue for something like a 512kB limit with a rather slow automatic increase (like BIP 103).


I do. Maybe I'll publish some of them someday.

It does say something like that with `debug=tor` set. I'm not sure if it says anything obvious without that, though you can tell that you're running a hidden service if it says something like `AdvertiseLocal: advertising address xyz.onion:8333` whenever it connects to a new peer.
A possible source of confusion is that Bitcoin Core will actually connect to Tor in two separate ways: once via Tor's ORPort (default 9050) to connect to the Tor network, and once via Tor's control port (typically 9051) to create a hidden service. One can succeed while the other fails.

**Yes**, BitGo is selling a false sense of security. BitFinex apparently had a perfectly good cold storage setup, but then they were somehow convinced that BitGo would be more secure, even though they were actually trading in cold storage for 100% hot storage.
On the other hand, I'm told that BitFinex was previously warned about this security issue, BitFinex should've known anyway, and they're the ones who lost the keys. So I'd say that it's still 90% BitFinex's fault, even though BitGo also deserves a lot of blame for pushing a service that is totally insecure in practice.

They're not incompatible. It's theoretically possible to have an interest-paying Bitcoin deposit account which practices fractional reserve, loaning out 90% or whatever of its deposits and relying on the fact that a bank run is very unlikely. This would increase Bitcoin's M1 money supply.
AFAIK all examples of interest-paying Bitcoin deposit accounts have turned out to have been scams, but such accounts would legitimately be feasible if Bitcoin ever reaches the point where you could use BTC to invest in bonds (etc.) with very low risk in BTC terms. This'd probably require a very stable BTC price.

*Incorrect* labeling would be fraud, and can be dealt with in civil court cases. *Requiring* any sort of labeling is tampering with the free market and impinging on the seller's freedom. And while no labeling should ever be required for any product, it's especially stupid in this case because it's based on totally nonsensical fears. It'd be like requiring labels for anything containing potassium chloride; nobody would actually be helped by the additional labeling, but some would be tricked into buying inferior or more expensive products, and businesses would pointlessly go out of their way to remove potassium chloride just for the advertising benefits, a ridiculous perversion of the free market.

I think that the future is dedicated hardware at essentially all levels. Maybe a bit like: 
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:59:37
The way I see Bitcoin evolving in the future is:
* For fairly simple changes like CSV, do a softfork directly.
* Almost every other change, even gigantic changes, can be done very smoothly in this way:
    * Create a sidechain with the new rules. Let it run for a year or two, and see if it gets popular/useful. Once sidechain support is added to Bitcoin, anyone will be able to create a sidechain with whatever crazy new ideas they want.
    * If the sidechain does become very popular, require that all Bitcoin full nodes enforce the sidechain's rules absolutely, promoting the sidechain from SPV-level security to full Bitcoin security. This is a softfork. If the sidechain has scaling issues (such as is the case for Monero-style ring signatures), you can say that the sidechain is only a required part of Bitcoin for a certain period of time (eg. 2017-2020), which allows for cycling to new sidechains over time.
    * From time to time, it may happen that the current root chain is so inferior to a sidechain that it is almost never used. In this case, it should be completely uncontroversial to do a hardfork to make the sidechain the new root chain in order to increase efficiency/convenience, and this can be done very gradually (2+ years) to ensure that ~nobody gets left using an incompatible version.
    * I envision at any given time there being one required sidechain that almost everyone uses, plus some obsolete required sidechains that people are in the process of migrating away from, plus perhaps a small handful of required "feature chains" (high-anonymity, microtransactions, etc.), plus a whole bunch of SPV-level-security experimental sidechains.
* The difficult sort of hardfork remains necessary for only a few things: broken crypto; a conscious decision to change the PoW; or abusive behavior by the majority of miners, which requires an immediate PoW change.

If the wallet.dat was originally not encrypted, he'll get different keys because when you first encrypt a wallet in Bitcoin Core, it intentionally tries to invalidate the old backup by:
* (If in non-HD mode) Marking all existing addresses in the keypool as used and regenerating the keypool.
* (If in HD mode) Generating a new master private key.
However, if the old wallet contains BTC, then encrypting it won't immediately remove that BTC from the old wallet. Though over time much of that BTC will probably end up in new change addresses.
Also, just changing the password on an already-encrypted wallet won't regenerate keys.

A Bitcoin private key is just a random number between 1 and 2^256 - 2^32 - 977. You can generate it with coins or dice.
Doing any elliptic curve operations on the private key is a *lot* more difficult. It's possible to do by hand, but totally impractical. If you want to try it, andytoshi wrote the 500-page [Seafarer’s Eſſential Table of Discrete Logarithms]( (which you would theoretically print out or buy from some crazy bookstore) and a [guide for using it to generate a public key from a private key]( He says that you might be able to generate a public key in less than 24 hours of constant work with this method.

It works, but Bitcoin doesn't have support for decentralized sidechains yet, so Elements Alpha is centralized. AFAIK, the devs are focusing more on scaling and fungibility, and sidechains seem to have been pushed to the back-burner for now.
Several of the [Elements]( are planned for Bitcoin softforks: Relative lock time is done, SegWit is coming soon, signature covers value is part of the SegWit softfork, and Schnorr Signatures is planned for the near future.

* The fees for a Bitcoin transaction equals its total input value minus its total output value. So if you accidentally forget a change address, you could accidentally send an enormous fee. Bitcoin Core will warn about absurd fees during `createrawtransaction`, I think, but the limit is pretty high IIRC.
* If you give an invalid change address, you would lose money. In general, you need to be very careful when using `createrawtransaction`.
* Because transactions do not currently explicitly say what their input values are, and because the offline computer in this setup doesn't have any block-chain data, a compromised online computer in this setup could return a transaction for signing which looks legitimate and gives no errors, but actually has a higher total input value than you intended, resulting in insane fees. Some hardware devices (including Trezor and KeepKey, I think) solve this problem by requiring that the transaction being provided for signing also be accompanied by the full input transactions. You can do this manually (use `gettransaction` on the online computer for each input spent in the transaction-to-be-signed, then check them all with `decodetransaction` on the offline computer), but it's a hassle. SegWit will fix this by requiring transactions to commit explicitly to input values.
It may be better to use a Trezor or KeepKey, which does essentially this same thing, but in a way that is less error-prone. (Though there are a small handful of security downsides to these devices compared to Bitcoin Core on a dedicated offline computer.)
@_date: 2016-08-27 03:24:34
I don't think that there's any real security impact. Bitcoin Core checks recent blocks in order to detect database corruption. If your database gets corrupted between 13 and 288 blocks in the past (the setting I suggested vs the default setting), then probably at some random point in the future Bitcoin Core will refuse to sync any further or give confusing errors, rather than giving a more helpful error at the time of the corruption. It's a little sub-optimal, but not a major issue.


@_date: 2016-08-31 23:14:37
Yes, the wallet in that case would work like Trezor/KeepKey/etc., getting some info from the merchant in order to create the transaction, asking the user for confirmation, signing the transaction, and then giving the transaction to the seller for them to broadcast. The wallet *never* needs to connect to the Internet, and the seller is not trusted in this process except that they might get some extra info about which / how many coins the buyer owns.

It encourages people to put money in anything other than debt-based investments (debt-based investments = bonds, deposit accounts, etc.). I think that since about 2013 the stock market has been in a huge bubble due in part to low interest rates, which was not nearly corrected by the tiny bump from 0.25% to 0.5%. It also promotes price inflation, though recently other factors have overridden this.

* New organizations chartered especially for this purpose, with known and trusted community members in charge (but perhaps also legally bound).

Peter Todd has proposed something like that. Though it's not 100% reliable because attackers can sometimes cause miners to see a transaction without you seeing the transaction until it's too late. For example, if 99% of nodes won't relay transactions with a certain non-standard format, then you probably won't receive it if an attacker sends it, but maybe the attacker knows of a miner who does not enforce this rule in his mined blocks, and he sends it directly to them. (You can even try it after the transaction has been mined -- if the fee is large enough, miners can be incentivized to go back and redo the block --, but this is a lot more difficult.)

Bitcoin should be as decentralized and trustless as possible, such that even destroying/compromising 90% of nodes doesn't really affect the other 10%.

The Bitcoin point-of-sale situation is very ad hoc at the moment. Everyone does different things. I'm not aware of anyone doing it like this, but you could.

It certainly was a bug in the guide to provide an expired pubkey, but just in case you're interested: you could fix this problem with `gpg --recv-keys 0x21F4889F`. This fetches the up-to-date key from whichever keyserver you have gpg configured to use. This is secure because the new key has to be signed by the old key or gpg will mark it as untrusted.

If you do it in the default way, then that's not really any more secure. Github could be compromised, or a MITM might be able to get a valid github cert.

If they're all independent and located in different countries, then you'd need 5-10 court orders in separate countries to blacklist or steal coins. It'd be very difficult to do at all, and especially to do it all at once without warning. (Though when choosing the signers, it'd be important to choose ones that aren't going to just immediately bow to a little pressure.)
The Tor directory authorities are a great example. With 3-5 (I forget the exact number) directory authorities, you can unmask any Tor user, including any hidden service. Doing so would be a very blatant attack which would be noticed immediately, so you could probably only do it effectively for a couple days, but it's still a very powerful attack. But AFAIK they have not been significantly targeted by governments.

If you trust miners absolutely (as merge-mined sidechains would), then these are basically equivalent ideas except that in a merge-mined sidechain:
* The miners are sort of arbitrary, and are *not* specially selected to be trustworthy.
* Due to the PoW, there *is* a non-zero confirmation time.
* A softfork to Bitcoin would be necessary to enable this -- it isn't possible with today's Bitcoin.
* The current top miners emerge more obviously from something like a free market, and could theoretically be out-competed. There can be no criticism of the signers being assigned due to "dev fiat" or anything like that. But I don't think that this actually offers many advantages, and it comes with the risk of good miners being unseated by bad miners. Since there can be multiple different competing sidechains with multiple different sets of signers, the signers do still end up coming from the bottom up in the federated scheme, just less obviously.
I think that the Blockstream people tend to think as you do and prefer the merged-mining model, but I just don't see the point. (It's also possible to do a hybrid merged-mining + federated signer approach, which I think might be better than federated alone.)
Of course, the great thing about sidechains is that everyone is free to try the idea that they think is best without interfering with anyone else. The necessary softfork for merged-mined sidechains won't happen too far in the future, I think.

It's trivial to double-spend 0-conf transactions. You usually can't do it with *100%* reliability, but you can do it fairly reliably by just sending one absolutely-minimal-fee transaction directly to BitPay and one very-high-fee transaction directly to miners, both sent at exactly the same time.
It's OK to accept 0-conf transactions if you can reverse whatever it is you're doing for the buyer, or if you know the buyer's identity and can therefore legally attack them for fraud if they reverse the transaction. But if you're going to do something irreversible with no recourse, you must wait for at least 1 confirmation. If it's something especially high-value, you should wait for more than one confirmation, since multi-conf transactions can also be reversed, though that's far more difficult and expensive (becoming exponentially more difficult the more confirmations there are -- see the chart on page 10 of [this document](

I don't think we'll ever get back to "everyone can be a miner", but IMO you could improve decentralization by changing it so:
* If the block number mod 3 = 0, the PoW uses the current algorithm (or similar).
* If the block number mod 3 = 1, an ASIC-resistant PoW is used, like cuckoo.
* If the block number mod 3 = 2, some sort of proof-of-stake is used. (Proof-of-stake is pretty much completely discredited when used alone, but I think that it adds value in a hybrid scheme like this with real PoW.)
There'd be three different difficulties, and the subsidy probably shouldn't be split evenly among the PoW types.
Then an attacker would need to control all three groups to perform a many-confs "51% attack", which would be a lot more difficult than today because the three PoWs are backed by very different things (ASICs vs probably botnets vs BTC).

Maybe try: 
Though Bitcoin is pretty special. Historically, money has usually started as something with obvious intrinsic value, like gold, nice-looking shells, etc. If this commodity also has certain other properties such as fungibility and durability, then people just start naturally using it as money without even consciously planning it. Even if you don't have any interest in owning the money commodity itself, you know that it will be useful to trade for other items in the future, so you're in turn willing to accept it; this starts a cascade effect which creates a money, potentially with a value far above its obvious intrinsic value. Fiat currency then typically develops by governments tricking people into thinking that their paper money is just as good as an existing hard money. They almost always end up defaulting on this promise, but by that point the fiat currency itself has become a money in its own right due to the same cascading process as above, even though it has zero intrinsic value.
Bitcoin is very unusual because it doesn't have an obvious intrinsic value, but it became a usable money without the bait-and-switch of fiat currency. The only other historical example I know of something similar is [stone money](

The rumor I heard is that BitFinex was set up such that although all BTC was held with BitGo, which apparently has reasonable cold storage practices etc., the BitFinex&lt;-&gt;BitGo settlement setup was such that anyone with BitFinex's (hot, online) key could withdraw large amounts of money from the BitGo accounts at any time. Exactly how much could've been stolen would depend on how much BitGo allowed BitFinex to "settle" at one time, but I don't know the details of how that worked.
Sort of reminiscent of having a "cold storage wallet" that will blindly follow the instructions of the live server... (Though maybe some limits were enforced.)

AFAICT, this hack didn't occur within BitGo. However, BitGo is selling a false sense of security to exchanges. With BitGo, exchanges create a transaction, sign it with their own (hot) key, and give it to BitGo to sign. BitGo then signs it pretty much blindly; there may be some limits, though in this case it looks like the limits may have been very high or non-existent. Without limits, it's not much better than putting everything in a hot wallet, but people *think* that it's even better than managing your own cold storage setup.
Every exchange *must* run their own full node and maintain their own cold storage.
Note that BitStamp also uses BitGo.

apt is like yum in this regard: the defaults are usually secure, but it's possible (and not particularly uncommon) to add insecure repos.


* The nginx yum repo actually is signed, but their documentation doesn't say how to make use of this, so nobody does. You have to modify their file in yum.repos.d to say `gpgcheck=1` and `gpgkey=file:///etc/path/to/gpg-pub-key`.
* If a repo is available over https, then you can configure this to be secure by similarly modifying the repo file.
* Otherwise, you just have to avoid using the repo.
Also, I am not very confident in the Linux package management scheme as a whole. Oftentimes, packages will be maintained by mostly-anonymous volunteers who have the power to push whatever updates they want. Sometimes there will be a little review to detect obviously malicious updates, but it's impossible to detect everything. So it may be the case that if any one of the maintainers for software on your computer turn evil, they could take over your computer. (If you use an extra-stable distro like Debian Stable or RHEL and don't add extra repos, there are extra checks and significant delays which make this far less likely.) Also, the update service (with the signing keys) could also be compromised -- the signing process is usually automatic, so the signing keys will be on a "hot" computer.
I've long thought that Linux package managers should behave more like the Android software installer, where programs are only allowed certain permissions agreed-upon by the user at start, and if a future update requires more permissions, the user has to agree to this. Some distros and packages use selinux, but the selinux policy will be maintained by the same person who maintains the package itself, and the user is never actually asked whether they approve of the selinux policy.

Addresses don't expire or anything like that. I suppose there's some risk that someone modifies your sheet of addresses somewhere along the line.
If you generate a large number of addresses, don't use any of them, and then send money only to like the 100^th address you generate, then the Trezor wallet software will probably not notice the transaction, and you'll have to do some manual finagling to get it working.

Lots of people mentioning Bitcoin there. That's nice to see. Bitcoin's status as a safe-haven asset, comparable to gold but with different (sometimes better) security properties, is one of Bitcoin's strongest attributes, and I think that this actually is getting quite a bit of recognition among the public at large.
If I had all of my money in traditional investments, I'd be very worried about getting pulled down into the traditional government/banking system's sinking ship. Capital controls, negative interest rates, bail-ins, etc. Certainly, BTC has very high volatility and a number of open technical issues, but its large degree of separation from the physical world gives it a lot of value over other assets.
Though even in that thread you still see a lot of people saying stuff like, "Why on Earth wouldn't you keep all of your money in the bank? Who carries more than a few hundred dollars in cash?"

Satoshi is using "verify" loosely there. With Merkle branch verification, you get a vague idea that the transaction has occurred and someone at least put a lot of effort into making it appear valid. With the addition of the "alerts" idea which Satoshi describes in the last paragraph of the SPV section (this idea is now called "fraud proofs"), it becomes a *somewhat* reliable way of determining transaction validity. However, the Bitcoin network doesn't actually support fraud proofs yet, and in any case the whole point of full nodes is to check that transactions are absolutely valid, not *probably* valid.
@_date: 2016-08-16 04:41:06
There are always tons of unconfirmed transactions floating around, since anyone with a little BTC can create tens of thousands of low-fee transactions. I just recently read an article saying that low-fee spam transactions from a 2015 spam flood are still sometimes getting confirmed. Rational miners will take the highest-fee transactions available at any given time.
So it's natural for blocks to always be full. If a block is not nearly-full, then this is either due to miners acting economically-irrationally or some sort of inefficiency in the system. For example, because building a new not-yet-mined full-size block is somewhat slow, miners will typically mine empty blocks if they solve one within ~30 seconds of the last one.
(You could argue that a rational miner might include fewer transactions because they want to encourage higher fees in the future, or because they think that shielding the Bitcoin network from unnecessarily-large blocks full of spam will improve their overall profitability long-term, but I consider both of these behaviors to be unlikely.)
For this reason, block-size and mempool-size stats are not very useful. What you really want to look at is confirmation delay for given fee levels, like on  ; it is undesirable for fees and/or confirmation delays to increase.

You shouldn't set up anything which causes BTC to be inaccessible for more than a year or so because:
* Bitcoin's crypto is expected to degrade over time and be replaced. In 50 years, transactions using the current crypto will probably be completely insecure. See 
* Although very unlikely, it is possible that some 0-day flaw in Bitcoin will require fairly quick action from all holders of BTC. This is possible in certain imaginable failures of SHA-256 or ECDSA, for example
* A hardfork or softfork could invalidate certain transaction formats, address types, etc. For example, it is theoretically possible for someone to have created a timelocked transaction several years ago that was valid then, but is now invalid due to BIP 66 or other softforks since then. Until Bitcoin reaches 1.0, you should never rely on a transaction which has been timelocked far into the future.

How mining typically works is that pools ask Bitcoin Core to construct mostly-completed blocks for them, and then the pool handles sending this block off to workers. Therefore, much of the mining policy -- choices miners make about which transactions to include, etc. -- is in Bitcoin Core. Child-pays-for-parent is a new default policy for miners. Miners can completely change default Core mining policies, of course, but usually they just make a few tweaks on top of the defaults.
You can't yet easily make *use* of this new policy because Bitcoin Core won't let you spend non-change 0-conf outputs except through the low-level raw transactions interface which normal users aren't going to want to use. In a future version, once miners have actually implemented the policy widely, UI support for CPFP will probably be added.
If you want to try taking advantage of CPFP using the raw transactions interface or different wallet software, then it's simple: just spend the stuck output and pay a higher fee/kB calculated based on the size of the new transaction *plus* the size of the old transaction. No special flag is necessary.

Apparently: BitFinex had a perfectly good cold storage setup some time ago, but then they were somehow convinced that BitGo would be more secure, and/or safer vis-à-vis CFTC regulations. With BitGo, each BitFinex user's wallet was segregated in a separate BitGo account. As far as anyone knows, BitGo's keys remained safe. However, the BitGo&lt;-&gt;BitFinex relationship was set up such that BitGo *would do whatever BitFinex said to do with users' BTC, with no limit*. So in practice, it was just the same as BitFinex having all of their BTC in a hot wallet. Their server got hacked, their BitGo API keys were stolen, the hacker used it to order BitGo's system to send them all of the BTC, and BitGo did so.
BitFinex is at fault for setting up this stupid system, and also for allowing one of their servers to be hacked (though the latter is more difficult to protect against). I'm told that they were even warned of this exact BitGo-blind-multisig problem in advance.
Also, IMO BitGo is almost equally at fault for selling a false sense of security, allowing this insane setup to exist, and signing away 120k BTC over the course of a few hours. Especially since they were taking a per-transaction fee (0.1%, IIRC) despite being completely useless.

Let's say that your recovery seed is "this is a bad seed".

    SHA-256("this is a bad seed0000002") = 073a1d490f9e0eaebae9b364836d4a4cafb970b4f1a0bbc9640d4e7b3802a787
    ...
In this way, you can use a seed to generate as many random numbers as you want. The properties of a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 guarantee that as long as the hash function is secure, it won't be possible to get the seed or any previous/next values from any of the random numbers without brute-forcing the seed (which is impractically slow for a strong seed).
Bitcoin private keys (which can be converted into public keys and addresses) are just 256-bit numbers. So given a seed, you can generate an arbitrary number of addresses, and two people with the same seed would generate exactly the same addresses. Your Trezor wallet is full of addresses that have been generated in this way.
(This is not exactly how it works, but it's similar. I think that the exact algorithms used in the Trezor are the ones specified in BIP 39 and BIP 32.)
You are trusting that mytrezor.com is giving you accurate transaction data. For example, they could tell you that you received BTC that you didn't really receive, or withhold transactions from you. But if the Trezor is secure, mytrezor.com will never see your seed or any of your private keys. You're also trusting that the company behind Trezor never signs a firmware update for the device which compromises its security.

I'm not going to write a detailed guide, but the general outline is:
* Set up one Bitcoin Core instance on the offline computer, and one on a usually-online computer.
* For every address generated on the offline computer, import it into the online wallet in watch-only mode using `importaddress ADDRESS LABEL false`. Unfortunately, I don't think that even 0.13 will support exporting or importing xpub addresses yet, so you'll have to do it manually for every new address. Make sure you do this *before* each address receives any BTC.
* On the online wallet, you can use most of the read-only commands on these watch-only wallets (eg. `getreceivedbyaddress`), though some commands require that you include an extra parameter to include watch-only addresses (eg. `listtransactions`). 
* On the *online* computer, create the transaction using `createrawtransaction`. `listunspent` will help you figure out which inputs you should spend.
* Copy the hex output of `createrawtransaction` to the offline computer. Use `decoderawtransaction` to check that it hasn't been modified somewhere along the way. Then use `signrawtransaction` to sign it.
* Copy the signed transaction to the online computer and use `sendrawtransaction` to broadcast it.

In most ways, this is less decentralized and less secure than the federated model because there are fewer important miners than there would be signers. The only way that merged mining is better vis-à-vis decentralization is that the current top miners emerge more obviously from something like a free market, and could theoretically be out-competed. But I don't think that this actually offers many advantages, and it comes with the risk of good miners being unseated by bad miners.
Also, this requires extending Bitcoin.

Type the first line into the terminal, which starts the process. The terminal should not output anything (except maybe the `&gt; ` input-prompt), but also not return to a normal prompt, until you type EOF on a line by itself. Everything between `&lt;&lt; 'EOF'` and `EOF` will be taken as input. This is a feature of bash called a *heredoc*.
When you type EOF on a line by itself, the input will be passed to the random number generator, but you won't get any confirmation/output -- it'll just return to a prompt.

Reducing the max block size is a softfork.
Satoshi did many softforks, and he had a funny way of doing them that would nowadays probably be considered too risky. He would just add to the code something like `if (current_time &gt; target_time) apply_new_rules()`, where target_time was set to be a few months from when the code was added. Then he assumed that the vast majority of people would upgrade in time, and since at this time mining was a highly distributed thing that most Bitcoin users engaged in, a majority of people upgrading would enforce the softfork. If enough people hadn't upgraded, then the network would've split in a way similar to a hardfork, but this never happened. Because Satoshi was worried about this happening, he tended to obfuscate softforks to discourage disruption due to controversy or explicit attacks.
Due to this secrecy, it's possible that I am the only person who complained about the max block size *before* it was activated (privately to Satoshi), which is a bit funny given the current circumstances.

As an anarcho-capitalist, I believe that government is a type of organized crime and that taxation is theft. So if Bitcoin eliminates all governments, I'd be ecstatic. However, even if Bitcoin becomes the  currency and also attains 100% anonymity, I very much doubt that that's going to happen -- at most, it'd push things a bit in the right direction.
Sales tax and income tax might become somewhat more difficult to collect, but governments could use the same methods they use today for cash: highly intrusive networks of reporting requirements to detect tax evasion. If "worst comes to worst", governments can get 100% of tax revenue from property tax, which no amount of crypto-anarchy is going to protect you from. The biggest impact would not be from any sort of anonymity, but in removing governments' ability to inflate the currency (a form of wealth tax).
Anonymous cryptocurrency is only a small piece in the crypto-anarchy puzzle. Assuming the ideal crypto-anarchist situation in which anyone can be 100% anonymous in whatever they do online, then:
* A lot of unjust laws would be made very difficult to enforce. This includes intellectual property laws and laws against victimless crimes. This is a very good result.
* Laws against fraud, hacking, etc. would be made very difficult to enforce as well, which is perhaps not so good. But I view crypto-anarchy as also encompassing technology which enhances one's ability to *defend* against these sorts of things as well -- I hope that once we live in a crypto-anarchist utopia (any day now...), hacking will be so difficult as to be almost unheard of, and people will have very powerful tools to protect against fraud.

I would say that Bitcoin primarily aims to be "digital gold" or "the new Swiss bank account", and has done very well in surviving for ~8 years with an extremely small number of major incidents. However, although massive technical advancements are constantly made, Bitcoin's core technology is nowhere near perfect yet, and the surrounding ecosystem (software and otherwise) is also very immature in the areas of security, privacy, ease-of-use, etc. Bitcoin is useful today as a *fairly* stable and reliable currency which is a member of a highly uncorrelated asset class and whose special qualities (no borders, no permission, contracts without middlemen, etc.) are especially attractive for certain businesses/people/transactions. But there's also truly massive space for growth; I believe that someday, after tons of development in the core Bitcoin network and elsewhere, the Bitcoin currency *could* become the most popular currency on Earth.
On a security blog, you might talk about Bitcoin Core's security measures, such as the gitian deterministic build system (made for Bitcoin Core IIRC), extensive testing (the testing was so exhaustive in libsecp256k1 that it found a security bug in the unrelated OpenSSL library), various secure coding practices, etc.

"Like eggshells" seems a bit strong. The  FBI + Carnegie-Mellon thing was greatly assisted by a bug in Tor which is now fixed. More bugs probably exist, but in general I'd say that finding a 0-day bug and then publishing it as part of a court case is a pretty high cost for an attacker, at least.
However, anonymity software is a lot weaker than a lot of people assume. I think that low-latency point-to-point protocols like Tor and I2P may always be too vulnerable to timing attacks to actually be strongly anonymous. I think that true anonymity will have to come from a distributed data store like Freenet or GNUnet. However, I am very dubious about the actual strength of all of these networks. Especially for Freenet and I2P, which seem to be designed rather haphazardly, but also for all other anonymity networks, I would be very surprised if a team of experts would be unable to find several design flaws or bugs which totally destroy their anonymity. Unfortunately, it seems that very few academics are working in this space; these networks don't get much review.
Out of all anonymity networks that I am aware of, GNUnet has the best design IMO, but its author is totally disconnected from real-world usage of his software... The software is difficult to get running (very many dependencies), and once you do get it running the usability is very poor. If someone either rewrote GNUnet so that it was more portable/self-contained or else nicely bundled it for all platforms (maybe just use static linking everywhere like Bitcoin Core), and then wrote an analogue of FProxy for it, then it could become more popular than Freenet.
One interesting fact that a lot of people miss about Tor is that it is very centralized, especially recently. If you allowed just anyone to become a Tor relay, then it would be pretty trivial to attack everyone's anonymity by filling the Tor network with evil nodes under your control.  So as time has gone on, Tor has become more and more a network of trusted relays blessed by the centralized Tor directory authorities. This is good in some ways and bad in others.

Make sure you backup your wallet first.
If you have `zapwallettxes=1` on its own line in a file named "bitcoin.conf" in your [data directory]( (ie. the same directory where wallet.dat is located), then Bitcoin Core will zap your wallet transactions when you start it, no matter whether you start it as bitcoind or via the GUI. After it does that, it might immediately close (I don't remember off the top of my head whether it keeps running or not). In any case, you should remove zapwallettxes from bitcoin.conf after you run Bitcoin Core with it once. You might also want to do a similar one-time run of Bitcoin Core with `rescan=1` (*after* zapwallettxes).

You have to trust miners, but it is decentralized (as decentralized as mining is, anyway). Alternatively, you can make a sidechain that instead of creating blocks through PoW &amp; mining, creates blocks by requiring signatures from n of m centralized verifiers, which might in some cases be acceptable and more secure. This is how Elements Alpha and Liquid work.


Normally, when BTC is moved from a sidechain back to Bitcoin, Bitcoin full nodes only check that the person moving the BTC has a transaction in the sidechain block chain which has been mined to a sufficient depth. This allows the majority of sidechain miners to allow whichever transactions they want. This is called SPV-level security.
To bring the sidechain to Bitcoin-level security, you require that all Bitcoin full nodes additionally participate in the sidechain, and absolutely reject:
* Invalid sidechain transactions on the sidechain network, according to the sidechain rules.
* Invalid sidechain blocks on the sidechain network, according to the sidechain rules.
* Transactions on the Bitcoin network which move BTC from a sidechain to Bitcoin via an invalid sidechain transaction.
* Blocks on the Bitcoin network which contain an invalid transaction as above.
Adding this requirement is a softfork, not a hardfork.


Softforks are done by humans, not automatically, so there's no need for a hard rule.

The main problem with the TPP and to a lesser extent NAFTA is that they give up national sovereignty. In order to create an "even playing field", they force a lot of legislation onto countries, plus a whole arbitration system surrounding this. It's a step toward world government, which is no good -- smaller units of sovereignty are always better, with the ideal being total individual sovereignty.
The thing that people always freak out about with the TPP is the ability for corporations to enter arbitration with governments on an equal basis, but this doesn't really bother me in itself. It's already possible in many cases for a corporation to sue a government, and it's not as if governments have any more moral legitimacy than a corporation. Though it is a symptom of the loss of local sovereignty.
Free trade -- the lack of tarrifs, import/export restrictions, capital controls, etc. -- is a very good thing. It's the reason why you can buy a new tablet (something that was barely even invented 10 years ago) for $55 now. When things can be done more cheaply in one location for whatever reason, then they *should* be done there. An illustrative example is that in the US, there has long been a tariff on sugar. Only a few places in the US are good for growing sugar, so it's more expensive to grow it domestically; however, the import price on sugar is artificially inflated as well, so sugar overall is more expensive. As a result, many products in the US use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar because it's cheaper than sugar in the US. This kind of ridiculous market manipulation hurts the vast majority of people for the benefit of a few (sugar producers).
In cases where there is not some actual geographical advantage for producing something (like sugar), loss of jobs due to free trade is usually due to over-regulation. Companies go to other countries because the reduced regulation makes labor much cheaper there. If people want more jobs, then they shouldn't blame trade deals, they should eliminate regulation. And if they don't want "bad" jobs which regulations push out of the market, then they need to make themselves more marketable. You can't expect employers to pay you $15/hr plus extensive benefits and taxes if your work only generates $13/hr or whatever; any attempt to force this to happen will fail.

might be interested in seeing this (kinsi55's comment above the one I'm reply to). Sounds like it could possibly be a Bitcoin Core bug which only affects people with certain hardware or configurations.
Total guess: Maybe your dbcache is set so high that your system is running out of memory to give to the rest of what Bitcoin Core is doing, so when Core allocates memory to start verifying a *lot* of blocks (not sure if it actually does this), you start swapping. Try setting `dbcache=300` to see if that helps.

99% of Bitcoin needs to move to dedicated hardware. End-users should have small hardware wallets which plug into point-of-sale dedicated Bitcoin payment terminals, or receive payment information from websites using dedicated Bitcoin "API boxes". IMO this is the only way to have widespread good security.
Even with that, it may be the case that end-users are too careless or insecure, in which case we might need an optional reversible transaction layer on top of Bitcoin so that ordinary people can undo their mistakes. The base irreversible Bitcoin would still be used for many things; it'd be analogous to wire transfers vs credit card transfers.

No, not for typical sidechains. Sidechain users can provide a compact proof that their transaction was verified by the majority of mining power on the sidechain. However, because the Bitcoin network *doesn't* verify transaction/block validity on most sidechains, miners are capable of completely running away with all sidechain funds. This is what's meant by the sidechain having SPV-level security.
Once a sidechain gets sufficiently popular, we can require that all full nodes *do* know the state of that particular sidechain, and then the sidechain can no longer be attacked by miners in this way. It becomes just as secure as the main Bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:20:26
IMO this would be an abusive action by miners. Miners exist to correctly order transactions. Knowingly rearranging transactions into an incorrect order would be wrong. The thief's transaction is valid, it clearly existed before any conflicting transactions (which don't exist yet), and there's no flaw in Bitcoin which caused this.
(It's impractical anyway. Miners can't change quickly enough.)

It's impossible to do it all on-chain. Something like Lightning will be the long-term solution.
Bitcoin as it exists now can be compared to a LAN in which everyone is using the same Ethernet cable. Everyone needs to deal with everyone else's stuff. If this LAN is nearing capacity, you might be able to improve things somewhat by getting better cables, doing smarter collision avoidance, maybe adding a second cable, etc. But the fact of the matter is that this arrangement of everyone broadcasting to the same medium doesn't scale. The solution in Ethernet is (in part) to add switches which keep messages localized to only the parts of the network where they matter. And this is what Lightning is meant to do: the vast majority of transactions will be localized to only small parts of the Lightning Network's "social graph" so that the entire Bitcoin network doesn't have to deal with every coffee purchase worldwide.
There are also [other options]( if Lightning doesn't happen as quickly or as well as hoped.

With sidechains, wide consensus wouldn't be necessary. Anyone could start a new sidechain with new features, and if the sidechain becomes extremely popular, then the sidechain can be codified into Bitcoin's core rules. Monero is an example of something that would work perfectly as a sidechain. Bitcoin users would transfer their bitcoins into the ring signature sidechain, move them, and then transfer them back into Bitcoin.
It's also not that difficult to do softforks if the change doesn't have any major drawbacks.

Hmm... Each byte of witness data is counted as 0.25 bytes for determining a transaction's contribution to a block's size vis-à-vis the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE limit, but fees don't need to follow this rule, and miners can do whatever fee calculation they want.  I don't know how the current segwit code handles it by default. If the same discount is also applied for fee calculation, then it'd be $1 * (1000 + 1000\*0.25) = $1250 per block.

The fee on that transaction is OK, and on its own would typically confirm in less than about an hour. But it was spending BTC received in an unconfirmed transaction, which was itself spending BTC received in an unconfirmed transaction. These transactions had low fees.

Nobody's proposing moving all Bitcoin commerce to their centralized sidechain. It's a nice *optional* add-on for those who want it.

Bitcoin as it exists now isn't really suitable for payments of less than tens of dollars or so. This is because how any block-chain-based cryptocurrency works is that *everyone* downloads *every* transaction done anywhere. It can be compared to a LAN in which everyone is using the same Ethernet cable. (This was a common way to arrange small LANs in the past.) Everyone needs to deal with everyone else's stuff. No matter what you do, this just isn't going to scale on its own.
The solution in Ethernet is (in part) to add switches which keep messages localized to only the parts of the network where they matter. In the future (hopefully the fairly near future), we will have this for Bitcoin in the form of the Lightning Network. Lightning localizes the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions to only small parts of the Lightning Network's "social graph" so that the entire Bitcoin network doesn't have to deal with every coffee purchase worldwide. It will substantially reduce fees, and also eliminate the need to wait for confirmations.
You can also enable low fees / high volume in a way that's much simpler than Lightning using [federated-peg sidechains]( or blinded bearer certificates, which sacrifice some decentralization in order to get a lot of cheap scaling (but on an *optional* component of Bitcoin -- full decentralization remains available for those who want it).
Also, the current point-of-sale situation is pretty bad. Ideally he'd be able to buy a device for $100-$300 which would handle all of the payment processing for him, like a credit card terminal. But AFAIK the only devices like this are experimental currently.

Probably different address formats would be used, so new nodes would know that they're sending a payment to an old node, and they could send an old-style transaction if they have any usable outputs to spend in their wallet. As I mentioned, if new-style outputs set the old-style value to be the real number of satoshis rounded down, then people would often be able to send such payments, though some value would be lost.
Another way of doing it as a softfork would be to have a micropayments sidechain supporting very low value outputs. Adding any sidechain at SPV-level security can be done by anyone, and bringing it to Bitcoin-level security is a softfork.

The MAST technology allows you to reveal only the "active" parts of a script when you spend an output with that script. So you could do a script with 5 of 1000 multisig, for example, and then you'd only ever need to publish the 5 public keys per transaction that you actually use. Overall, this has two major advantages:
* Cost/Size/Scaling: Even huge scripts would generally require only fairly small proofs. This has relevance even today, but in the future it could be critically important when dealing with more complicated contracts.
* Privacy: Some of the script is not revealed, which can improve privacy. For example, an escrow could have the same public key across multiple transactions, and unless you have to appeal to the escrow, no one would ever see this escrow public key.

@_date: 2016-04-19 19:49:18
Full node wallets like Bitcoin Core have the goal of enforcing the rules of Bitcoin with 100% accuracy no matter what. When you see a new transaction, this transaction will spend some bitcoins that were sent in a previous transaction. And that previous transaction will spend bitcoins sent in an even older transaction, etc. So the only way to know for sure whether any Bitcoin transaction is valid is if you've downloaded and verified all of its ancestor transactions. (It's not necessary to *store* all of the ancestor transactions, but you have to download and verify them.) "Syncing" is downloading and verifying every on-chain Bitcoin transaction that's ever been done so that you are able to immediately verify all new transactions as they happen. When it says you're "X years behind", that means that you're in the process of downloading all transactions that occurred X years ago.
Lightweight wallets like Electrum don't do this, but then they can't be 100% sure that the transactions or blocks they deal with are actually valid. To a large degree, they trust some third-party to tell them what's correct. As a result, they have somewhat reduced security.
My recommendation is:
* If you process Bitcoin payments automatically, then your automatic payment processing system really *must* use a full node. Otherwise the risk due to insecurity is too great.
* If you're a business or an individual who uses Bitcoin a lot, you should set up one always-on full node (preferably on a server you physically control, not on a cloud server), and you should configure your lightweight wallets to talk exclusively to this full node. This will help Bitcoin and also improve your security.
* Otherwise, a lightweight wallet is OK, though there's certainly nothing wrong with running a full node wallet if you want. IMO Bitcoin Core's wallet is one of the best wallets overall for power users even ignoring the fact that's it a full node. (Other wallets are probably better for Bitcoin beginners.)

Miners do not have any moral authority to change the rules of Bitcoin. They are a small class of people with different incentives from most Bitcoiners, and a core principle of Bitcoin is individual sovereignty. But the way that Bitcoin works just happens to make it far safer/smoother to make changes to Bitcoin when the change is structured as a softfork and a large percentage of miners (&gt;50%, but ideally higher) start enforcing the new rule all at once. If miners start enforcing stupid new rules, then the Bitcoin economy can and should change the PoW algorithm to remove these miners. If miners refuse to enforce new rules that have widespread consensus, then the rule change can be forced through by (sort-of) converting the softfork to a hardfork. If miners break established rules, then all full nodes will automatically reject their blocks, no matter how many miners do this. Miners *are not* Bitcoin's rulers. Note that BIP 9 doesn't ever actually say "voting", because that would imply that miners do have some sort of decision-making authority -- the term used in BIP 9 is "signalling".
@_date: 2016-04-10 19:27:49
That's basically how solo mining works. Every ~10 minutes, you have some low probability of solving a block and winning the subsidy + fees. (The point of pooled mining is to increase the probability while reducing the reward per miner.)
Even if mining has negative expected value, and so no one can *profitably* mine, I could definitely see gamblers mining in hopes of getting lucky.

@_date: 2016-04-08 13:28:27
Yeah, you could set all output values to 0 (this is legal) and put the real values inside of output scripts or something. The downside to this is that if you have a wallet full of new-style transactions, you wouldn't be able to pay users of old wallets. Maybe this could be fixed by setting the old-style value to be the total value rounded down to the nearest satoshi.
I've always thought that it'd be interesting to change values to be rational numbers so that you could for example send someone exactly one-third of a bitcoin. That's never been done before with an electronic payment system, I think. (Though likely this is too big of a change for not enough benefit to ever really be done.)

The hardfork by ETH is what triggered the breakaway non-hardfork ETC. This'd be far different because the miners' action would not be a hardfork -- all Bitcoin nodes nodes would automatically follow the miners' reorg. But if there is a widespread belief that miners acted abusively, there may be calls to hardfork to a different PoW.
Note that miners can only reorg so far back... A reorg longer than 288 blocks starts having a chance of being rejected by large subsets of full nodes due to pruning. So if the theft was reversed, it wouldn't be accurate to start saying "miners can reverse whatever transactions they want, whenever they want!", but it'd still set a bad precedent. Miners shouldn't be making value judgements or changing the chain's history.

You can put the dice rolls in a string and then hash that to get a random number. For example, if you roll 4, 1, 6, 3, ..., then create a string "4-1-6-3-..." and hash that. If you need a longer random number, take the previous hash, append it to your "4-1..." string, and hash that. Again append that hash to the original entropy data, etc. to get an infinite amount of random data. Linux uses basically this same method for /dev/{u,}random, though it gets the raw entropy from keystrokes and such rather than dice rolls.
Keep in mind:
* Doing RAND_NUM % 5 to get a number between 0 and 4 does not result in a uniform distribution, no matter how random RAND_NUM is. This is a very common mistake.
* Each roll of a perfect die adds log2(die_faces) bits of entropy. You probably want at least 128 bits of entropy, so at least 50 rolls of a 6-sided die.

It's not a protocol rule, but what Bitcoin Core does is that if one of its sent/received transactions is not confirmed, it resends it to all of its peers periodically. If any of these peers don't already have it, then they'll relay it. Nodes never rebroadcast transactions in their mempools.

MAST probably does speed things up, since nodes don't have to work through the parts of the script that will never be validated, though the active parts of a script still need to be executed.

No, decentralized sidechain support will require a softfork in Bitcoin. Blockstream's Liquid and Alpha sidechains are federated (ie. centralized) sidechains. How these basically work is that there are a handful of designated "miners", and only they can mine sidechain blocks (without PoW). The security is not as bad as relying on a single counterparty because a number of independent entities need to cooperate in order to break the sidechain's rules, but it's still centralized.
With the proposed sidechain softfork to Bitcoin, decentralized sidechains will be possible. These won't be quite as secure as Bitcoin because miners will have more power than in Bitcoin proper, but you can still do a lot of things with them. I think that in the future, almost all hardforks will be done by:
* Implementing the hardfork in a sidechain. This is indeed completely permissionless. Even a single person can unilaterally set up their own sidechain.
* If the sidechain becomes very popular, it can get full Bitcoin-level security if Bitcoin codifies the sidechain. In other words, all Bitcoin full nodes would be required to also be full nodes on the sidechain. This is a softfork to Bitcoin.
* If the sidechain is better than the main Bitcoin chain in every way, then perhaps the main Bitcoin chain could be phased out in favor of the sidechain over the course of many years. This would not apply to sidechains with trade-offs (eg. ring signatures, which have major performance/scaling costs).
This is a very smooth and safe way of making even rewrite-scale changes to the Bitcoin network.
Until decentralized sidechains, I guess my previous statement about altcoins being pointless is not quite true. It would make sense to temporarily pass value through Monero to improve privacy, for example.

Increased freedom often has small negative side-effects like that, but it's always worth it as long as the freedoms gained don't themselves violate the non-aggression principle.
The arguments are similar to those of gun control. Yes, gun control would make things slightly more difficult for criminals, but most criminals would just find ways of bypassing the laws. 419 scammers existed before Bitcoin, for example, and they did things like convince people to not contest a check until it was too late to reverse, or require a wire transfer, or require cash in the mail. Similar things would be done by ransomware if Bitcoin didn't exist.
Also keep in mind that Bitcoin's privacy is currently not very good. (Though hopefully this will be improved someday.) Given enough analysis, you could probably figure out what any of these ransomware people are doing with their BTC, at least, no matter how much "mixing" they've done. If police combined blockchain analysis with their normal police work, I suspect that many cases of Bitcoin theft (and similar) would be solvable. (I've personally used blockchain analysis to help police succeed in investigations a few times.)
Although people usually tend to significantly overestimate the privacy provided by Bitcoin, Tor, I2P, Freenet, etc. as they currently exist (I wouldn't use these things for something illegal unless my life depended on it), I do think that we're inexorably moving in the direction of online crime being untraceable. I don't think that this can be stopped without significantly constraining the entire Internet. In many ways this is good, since online crime is at least not physically violent, and very many laws are unjust. But it does mean that computer security is going to have to be massively improved so that we can stop theft from happening rather than tracking down who did it. (Currently, security is a joke almost everywhere you look, even in things that are supposed to be high-secure.)

It means that some random person is spending some BTC... "Tracking coins" is not meaningful without manual interpretation using outside info; trying to get anything real from "taint graphs" alone is futile. A *significant percentage* of all bitcoins are probably tainted with known Satoshi-coins.
Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal and several other people on 2009-01-12; see the transaction f4184fc[...]. **The very first version of Bitcoin always put the change address second,** so you can easily follow the chain of transactions to see that Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal, then 10 BTC (unspent), 1 BTC (spent), 1 BTC (spent), and 10 BTC (spent) to other unknown people, all on the same day. Then Satoshi's remaining change remained unspent to this day. While it is theoretically *possible* that one of those spends was from Satoshi to himself, most probably those are all to random people from the cryptography mailing list (like Hal). Furthermore, this chain of transactions involving 50 BTC is the one and only *proven* example of Satoshi-coins; the stuff you hear about Satoshi owning a million BTC or whatever is entirely speculation.

All else being equal, if the price doubles I'd expect USD-denominated fee rates to remain roughly the same. Fees are supposed to be a sort of bidding system, so it should have a fairly consistent value regardless of the BTC price. Some poorly-designed wallets used a fixed fee, which might drive fees up somewhat, but I definitely wouldn't expect USD-denominated fees to *double*.
$1/kB seems possible someday, but I'd be surprised if it happens for long periods of time this year at least. (A large spam attack or drop in mining power could cause it to rise to this level temporarily.)


Decentralization is *already* quite bad. The most worrying thing is when businesses use centralized third-party APIs instead of running their own full node because running a full node is too annoying/expensive. Even the ~2 MB provided by SegWit will make this worse, especially in terms of the initial sync and the network's overall lack of upload bandwidth.
One nightmare scenario is this: some miner accidentally mines a block that's invalid due to violating some obscure rule that is not on its own all that important. Then all of the other miners, who are stupidly doing headers-only mining, mine on top of this block and keep mining on it indefinitely. All full nodes reject this invalid chain, but lightweight nodes don't know any better and stick with it. Miners don't notice for a long time. If miners abandon this invalid chain, they will lose a lot of subsidy, and transactions downstream that subsidy will also be lost. Maybe some popular but horrible Bitcoin bank like Coinbase is doing incomplete validation and also accepted the invalid block, and now they've been accepting invalid BTC for a long time. So there is a lot of pressure to not abandon this invalid chain. Miners get together with the handful of major players who actually do validation and decide to add an exception *just this once*. Since almost no one runs full nodes, life returns to normal for most people... But now there's precedent for the rules of Bitcoin being broken. Bitcoin's security is proven as worthless, and the value of the currency shortly follows.
The main thing preventing the above scenario (and a number of similar possible catastrophes) is that a large enough portion of the economy will reject invalid chains no matter what. Currently this is provided mainly by businesses relying on their own full nodes rather than trusting external services, and to a lesser extent by individuals doing the same, which is why it's extremely concerning when they turn to third-party APIs or use lightweight nodes. Pruning and libsecp256k1 were important advancements in making it easier to run full nodes. Not too far in the future there will hopefully be other things making full nodes easier to run: syncing backward, distributed storage of historical block chain info, IBLT, etc. The biggest improvement would be fraud proofs, which would allow even lightweight nodes to usually reject invalid chains -- then it wouldn't be *so* bad to lose some full nodes.
Also, the network propagates blocks very inefficiently, which could cause high orphan rates for miners and possibly long splits in the network for blocks even between 1 MB and 2 MB. IBLT and/or weak blocks would improve this.


It depends on what technology exists at that time. It might be reasonably safe if IBLT and/or weak blocks are rolled out before then. I think that a 4 MB limit could probably only be activated in 2017 if it was done via softfork. For a hardfork, there'd be a strong desire to schedule it a year in advance to ensure safety, and I don't think that it'll be ready to schedule this year.
I won't be surprised if we have 4-8 MB blocks in 2018.
The Hong Kong agreement calls for proposing a hardfork to activate in mid 2017, but I think that this refers to BlueMatt's proposal. BlueMatt's proposal sets MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 2 MB, but also adjusts SegWit's witness discount so that overall there is very little change in the expected max block size compared to pre-hardfork SegWit, and actually there's a *reduction* in the maximum possible total block size (non-witness + witness) compared to pre-hardfork SegWit. This would be safe, and I tend to think it's a good idea, but it's not an increase to 4 MB.

Rarely, you can make outgoing connections to nodes that are still bootstrapping, and these nodes might download blocks from you. You can use the `maxuploadtarget=X` setting to limit this. (X is the number of MBs per 24 hours.)

For now, I think that the best solution is to be able to gracefully handle evil miners. This includes increasing the number of full nodes and adding fraud proofs to the network so that lightweight nodes know when the longest chain is actually invalid. If all lightweight nodes used fraud proofs, Bitcoin would be massively more secure because it would be extremely difficult for miners to trick anyone into accepting an invalid chain which creates too much BTC, steals BTC, etc.
After fraud proofs, the remaining problems are double-spending and transaction censorship. For example, the Chinese government could right now require that all Bitcoin users submit identity info in order to use Bitcoin, since the majority of miners are in China, and they can censor whatever transactions they want. That's a big problem. I think that the only way to make miners unlikely to do this, and to handle things if they do, is to be willing and ready as a community to immediately change the PoW if the majority of miners engage in this stuff.
More speculatively: Assuming that someone can design a PoW algorithm that won't give ASICs any advantage over desktop machines (despite what you may have heard, it is not at all clear whether this is actually possible), I think that it might be an improvement to change the PoW so that:
* If the block height mod 3 = 0, the current PoW is used.
* If the block height mod 3 = 1, the ASIC-resistant PoW is used.
* If the block height mod 3 = 2, some sort of proof-of-stake is used. (Maybe using the method in Meni Rosenfeld's Proof of Activity proposal.)
Within each group, there would probably be some degree of centralization, but it seems unlikely that there'd be enough cooperation between the three groups to do evil.
@_date: 2016-04-10 17:55:30
I feel like even with a memory-bound PoW, someone would eventually create specialized hardware able to do it so much faster than desktops that desktops can't reasonably participate. (But I don't know that much about hardware design.)


The reason I split them up using the mod 3 thing was to prevent one of the group from bringing tons of new power online and overpowering the other groups. It's possible that you could do this in a cleaner way -- I haven't thought about it very much.

Oh, you're the one who invented cuckoo. You probably know more about hardware than I do. I've heard some people say that perhaps it is theoretically possible for a "weird ASIC" to be designed that would be much better at cuckoo than desktops, but I don't know anything about the details, and it sounds like cuckoo is the prime candidate for an ASIC-resistant PoW.
I agree that it'd be good for mining to have negative EV. People will still participate for the "lottery" aspect, in addition to the idea of just helping the network.

It's not known.
The main chain's max block size should be as large as safely possible. Exactly what's "safe" isn't known, but the factors which must be considered include decentralization and (some believe) incentivizing enough fees for mining security. To ensure decentralization, probably in the long-term the max block size's growth will be limited by the growth in computer capabilities for typical individuals, especially upload bandwidth and CPU power. In the shorter term -- the next 10 years or so -- larger max block sizes will probably be made safe much more quickly due to improvements in Bitcoin's own efficiency. For example, the Bitcoin network is currently very inefficient with bandwidth.
Then, given some safe max block size, the lowest-size reasonable transaction will be dependent on demand for the available block space, which is unpredictable.
One way you might start to analyze it is to say: OK, so with the ~2 MB max block size that SegWit will give us, getting the minimum fee per kB to $1 would require at least $1 * 2000 = $2000 per block = $288,000 per day. Does it seem likely, given Bitcoin's properties, the expected amount of demand, etc., that people will on aggregate pay this much on fees per day?

A Bitcoin private key is a random number between 1 and approximately 2^256 (actually the upper limit is somewhat less than 2^256 ). It has no other special structure.
I like this analogy (I got it from some video, don't remember which one): Imagine that there is an unimaginably huge wall with 2^256 lockers. The lockers are unlocked, but you have to take the effort of opening the door in order to access the contents. To store your bitcoins, you choose a random locker and put your bitcoins there. You know exactly where your locker is, so you can easily find it and get your bitcoins again. But if someone wants to steal your bitcoins (or anyone's), they have to search through all of the lockers. There are *so many* lockers that this search is simply infeasible: even if all of human computing was dedicated to the task, it would take decades on average to come across a locker that *anyone* had used.
(In Bitcoin, due to the way addresses work, each locker in the above analogy actually has a magic portal connecting it to about 2^96 random other lockers. So there are actually "only" 2^160 distinct locker spaces. This doesn't make attacks significantly easier.)

They have been OK so far, though we certainly shouldn't rely on that.
I think that there should be an effort to write a sort of "Bitcoin constitution" which would lay out exactly which lines miners won't be allowed to cross. Everyone of economic importance would be asked to sign it, and if they don't (and if the document has no flaws), then everyone will know that they're an anti-Bitcoin company. Writing this would be pretty difficult, though. For example, miners should be able to block spam transactions, and it's difficult to unambiguously distinguish between spam filtering and censorship of legitimate transactions in a document.

    ControlPort 9051

And then add the user that bitcoind runs as to the group that tor runs as (by editing /etc/group or using some distro-specific command). To be sure that it's working, add `debug=tor` to bitcoin.conf and check debug.log for messages related to Tor.

The paper is not a good introduction to Bitcoin. It was written in 2008 (before Bitcoin even existed) in order to convince users of the cryptography mailing list that the idea was workable. It was never a complete description of Bitcoin, and it was never good for newbies. I was very familiar with crypto and P2P when I first discovered Bitcoin, and it took me a while to fully understand the paper even with the benefit of being able to ask Satoshi about any questions I had. It is especially not good for newbies 10 years later, when the very language we use to talk about these things has changed substantially. The paper is a historical artifact, very interesting and not inaccurate, but **very very bad** for actually gaining technical understanding of anything.

Good points by the Representative and the first two hosts, but overconfidence is the biggest mistake you can make on anything. We're not living in a storybook, and we are not *destined* to win.
In the US I think it's very likely that someday soon a little provision will be tucked into a must-pass bill at the last minute requiring reporting all BTC holdings via FBAR. After that, while there's currently no momentum whatsoever for it, it'd be a fairly simple matter to someday say "turn over your bitcoins, which we know you have, or go to jail" (or "we can prove you have bitcoins, but you didn't report it, so you go to jail").
The push for regulation increases constantly, worldwide. Each regulation is a reduction in freedom and a weight around the BTC economy's neck. In the end, it's not unimaginable that someday BTC will *technically* not be restricted for end-users, but all legally-operating on-ramps and off-ramps will be forbidden from transferring BTC to/from non-KYC wallets, not even trustless wallets. People who stay within this legally-acceptable area would be using something no better than (and with no competitive advantage over) fiat in bank accounts.
It's not unimaginable that LN nodes, even though trustless and not holding any user BTC, will be harmfully regulated. And the same could be true of other methods of scaling, most of which have centralization trade-offs. (Including on-chain scaling, where the centralization trade-off is the reduction in the distribution and economic power of full nodes.)
If one of the biggest governments really wanted to destroy Bitcoin's value as a free economy at any cost (which seems very unlikely, but isn't impossible), they'd offer billions of dollars in subsidies to domestic miners, but also legally require that these domestic miners only mine transactions that have been approved by some government entity. Then when they had enough such miners, they'd also require that the miners only extend chains which fall under this regime, essentially doing a (illegitimate) softfork into a centralized coin. [Bitcoin is not ruled by miners]( so this wouldn't be the end of BTC, but it'd be *extremely* problematic, and perhaps the end of *mainstream* BTC.
Satoshi said, "Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years." He didn't say that BTC can endure direct assault by major governments and come away *completely unscathed*; it can't. We should try to prevent the nightmare scenarios I mentioned (and others), hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. It's true that governments will never be able to completely stamp out cryptocurrency, but at some point oppression could reach levels where all BTC usage and development would have to move deeply into the shadows, which would greatly reduce Bitcoin's ability to impact the world. (At that point, BTC would hopefully become a small part of a wider revolution, and not just a fading remnant of freedom.)

The trouble with this charity in particular is that it seems to support things like the "cake incident", where people are trying to force people/businesses to do things with their own private property that they don't want to do. That's oppression. If it was just trying to eliminate internal *government* discrimination against LGBT people, that'd be totally fine. For example, I unreservedly support redefining marriage to allow LGBT couples in the tax code and similar (though it'd be better to eliminate the income tax and all other areas of government where the idea of marriage even matters).
It was *the government* that chemically castrated Alan Turing. People despised him for something he had no control over, and so they used the government to engage in violence against him. That's all the government is: violence with more steps. If someone is actively bigoted against LGBT people, perhaps he is worthy of being despised (to greater or lesser extent, depending on the circumstances); boycott his businesses, put ads up against him, don't invite him to parties, etc. But if you try to use government violence against him, then you are just perpetuating the cycle of violence. The solution is to *minimize* government involvement in all things, not to redirect the beast in a direction that you prefer.

Schnorr and taproot have always been softforks. There are no planned hardforks.


No, I mean that when you'd download "0.13.2LTS", it'd come with a copy of the current version as of the time of the download (eg. 0.16.3) which would then automatically run inside of a software sandbox set up by 0.13.2LTS, and then the newer version would be used by the LTS version basically as a second opinion. Something like this is already a recommended setup for high-value things like exchanges, but there it's done manually on multiple separate machines.

The entire private-property portion of the civil rights act should indeed be repealed (but not the part which constrains government). This position is held by the vast majority of libertarians, since the CRA is a blatant violation of property rights, and in order to justify it, you must ignore the non-aggression principle and/or make the utilitarian argument that *avoiding hurt feelings* is worth infringing on private property, the cornerstone of libertarianism.
You can *imagine* a world in which gays or blacks or whites or whoever are totally rejected everywhere and discrimination becomes more than just hurt feelings, but that's not going to happen in today's world. This isn't the 19th century. If the CRA was repealed right now, only a tiny handful businesses would turn away customers due to discriminatory personal beliefs. Successful businessmen want your money, and don't care about your identity. If you got turned away from somewhere, it'd feel bad, sure, but you'd just find another business that'd be more than happy to take your money. If some crazy thing happened which made 75% of people absolutely despise people with red hair (or whatever) to such an extent that they would turn away customers, then they'd almost certainly use the government to *magnify* the effects of their bigotry; such a powerful societal force would not be constrained by existing law for long.
Some videos:
* [Ron Paul on the CRA](
* [One of my favorite ancap youtubers on the CRA / racism](
* [John Stossel on the CRA](
(Mainly people talk about the CRA in the context of racism, but LGBT discrimination is exactly the same idea, and the CRA is the main legal justification which groups like Lambda Legal use.)


That was an issue of discrimination *by government*, which should indeed be eliminated. As long as government exists, it should be as non-discriminatory as possible.


It's an *example*. Do I need to list all of the horrible and bigoted things done by every government, continuing to the present day? Eg. drug users are currently jailed by the US government at a high rate and discriminated against widely by companies, despite drug use being victimless and sometimes caused by a genetic disposition to addiction and/or poor upbringing.

It's very similar to the [value overflow incident]( If it were exploited, old nodes would see the illegitimately-created BTC as valid, and would accept transactions using the fake BTC, while upgraded nodes would reject such transactions. Eventually the invalid transactions would be eliminated once the new version became widespread. The main source of possible losses is in accepting illegitimately-created BTC which will eventually be eliminated; this is possible if you're using an old version of Bitcoin Core or if you're not using a full node at all.
Any incident now is pretty unlikely, since most miners and the vast majority of big economic participants are believed to have upgraded. Even if the majority of miners started exploiting this, exchanges (who have all upgraded at this point) would just ignore their blocks, so the damage would be very limited. It'd affect mainly individuals who use lightweight wallets or haven't upgraded yet.

Agreed, it will create exposure to a massive market, and the BTC price would almost certainly skyrocket. But it's kind of stupid, since many people in that market can already buy BTC ETNs, and they don't because ETNs are rightly viewed as too high-risk. However, I'm not so sure that an ETF is going to be any lower-risk than an ETN due to all of the weirdness (vs all other assets) associated with BTC, and maybe an ETN could even be lower-risk in some cases. An ETN is holding no BTC which it can lose, for example.
(This is why the SEC is dragging their feet, though I think that there's so much demand that they will *eventually* approve a BTC ETF.)

It's a good illustration of what would've happened in a mainnet attack: Coins would be created out of thin air, these counterfeit coins would be accepted by some people, and eventually the transactions involving the counterfeit coins would be undone. In a 0-day attack, there would've been significant losses from people accepting these counterfeit coins which later disappear (eg. exchanges would probably have their hot wallets emptied by the attacker), though contrary to what some people seem to imagine, there's no way that this illegitimate inflation would last. If a similar attack were to happen right now (which is possible, though difficult &amp; unlikely), people using an upgraded full node would completely ignore the transactions involving counterfeit BTC, while people using vulnerable or lightweight wallets would accept the counterfeit BTC.
If blockchain.info isn't doing proper transaction verification on their testnet version, then it makes me very suspicious that they aren't doing proper verification with their wallet service and APIs, in which case their users would even now accept such counterfeit coins as real BTC. Who knows how upgraded other similar services are. And even in the absence of any bugs, there are countless ways for miners to trick lightweight wallets into accepting counterfeit BTC. It underscores the importance of running a full node rather than trusting third-parties, especially if you process payments automatically.

He never specified. It seems that a lot of sources use 中本哲史, but that's a guess that someone made, and does not actually come from Satoshi. He probably just chose two very common Japanese names, and maybe he didn't even know the first thing about the Japanese language; he was certainly never seen writing in Japanese. IMO formal works should use katakana rather than guessing at the kanji.
BTW, 里 on its own has a rare reading of "Satoshi", and I've proposed that as the symbol for the satoshi unit. The kanji on its own is pretty rare, but the 里 radical is seen in meaningful words like 理想 (ideals), 理論 (theory), 理性 (reason), 理科 (science), and 量 (quantity).

Adoption is the goal, of course, but I'm not sure whether or not mass adoption would *help*.
Politically, if people got used to BTC, that'd provide inertia against some types of legal barriers. This inertia is why the US can't really ban cash, even though it's even more anonymous than Bitcoin. But on the other hand, there are a lot of stupid people, and the current ways of interacting with BTC make it incredibly easy to lose your money compared to banks. Widespread losses, assuming they don't themselves prevent adoption, would be used as an excuse for regulation.
Technologically, there are all sorts of issues. The most straightforward way to achieve ease of use and low fees is always centralization. For example, a lot of people invest in Bitcoin (very different from Bitcoin *adoption*, BTW) via Robinhood, a centralized derivatives-type thing, not even a wallet. If 1% of the world's population suddenly decided to start using Bitcoin, the vast majority of them wouldn't be competent enough to use secure and decentralized wallets, and the influx of people would cause a ton of difficult-to-address scaling issues. In the end, many people would lose money, and essentially all of the rest would end up using hosted wallets, which could then be easily subverted.
Within this space I think that the main issue is that there aren't enough man-hours being devoted to useful technology. Some top priorities IMO are:
* Making privacy (eg. CoinJoin) the *default*. Leveraging Bitcoin's existing userbase, this creates political inertia for privacy in cryptocurrencies, and nips chainalysis-type stuff in the bud.
* Improving secure, decentralized, scalable ease-of-use. There still isn't a great way of using LN trustlessly, for example. Also, I think that Bitcoin hardware (wallets and point-of-sale) are what ordinary people should ultimately use, but the current solutions are very immature.
* Research on safe scaling, addressing network-level threats against the Bitcoin network, possible ways to respond to hypothetical attacks by miners, etc.
* Identifying single points of failure in the ecosystem and replacing them with decentralized solutions. Bisq is a good example, though it's far from perfect.

You'd probably backport softforks to a LTS branch. Some softforks like CLTV or (likely) Schnorr are pretty simple, so it's not a big deal to backport those, but there is a question about what to do with quite complex softforks like SegWit: do you delay it for a long time, introducing say a 1% chance of chainsplit-related issues, or do you backport it ASAP and expose LTS users to say a 0.01% chance of serious vulnerabilities in the new code?
gmaxwell talked about some of the potential issues with software diversity [in the forum thread](
One thing that could be done, though it's kind of ridiculous, would be for a LTS version to automatically come with the newest version, run that version in a sandbox, and connect to the network only through that newer version. Then you get the best of both worlds safety-wise, though with double the resource requirements.

Instead of putting transactions into blocks right away, imagine that we put them into some global "bucket". Every day, the bucket gets emptied and put into blocks, but in the process of emptying it we consolidate and simplify the transactions so that only the end result is reflected on the block chain. For example, if the bucket contains:
* Alice -&gt; Bob 0.5
* Alice -&gt; Bob 0.5
* Bob -&gt; Carol 1
* Carol -&gt; Dean 0.1
This consolidates to:
* Alice -&gt; Carol 0.9
* Alice -&gt; Dean 0.1
Only these two transactions would go into the block chain. Note the significant reduction in the number of transactions.
This is pretty far from how Lightning actually works (there's certainly no global "bucket"), but I think that it is effective at illustrating the basic idea of Lightning as a "caching layer". Here's a presentation with an explanation of how it actually works:

Not reliably right now because your original transaction could be malleated before making it into a block. (Edit: actually, this isn't much of an issue for OP's case; see the replies.) If that happens, its txid will change, and your second transaction's reference to the first transaction's txid will be invalid, so it won't go through. Segregated witness will fix this by eliminating malleability. (Note however that transactions created now won't be benefited by SegWit -- it's a new tx type.)

That said, there are very few (if any) open source software projects with more care and expertise than Bitcoin Core. It solves a *very* difficult software engineering problem, and has a *very* good record. There's a reason that almost every cryptocurrency is based on Bitcoin Core.

Yes. They can also reverse transactions. This is clearly mentioned in their whitepaper.


USD is *fundamentally* centralized. There will never be a decentralized USD token of any type (unless the US redefines the USD as being a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency).
All that being said, if I understand it correctly, GUSD seems to offer a surprising level of freedom. It seems that you could withdraw GUSD and then apply various mixing on it, move it wherever you want, and otherwise treat it basically like cash. They can freeze accounts and undo transactions, but the accounts are still pseudonymous. I've never seen a regulated institution offer something like this. I suspect that it won't last.
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:32:55
First, I don't think that modern versions of Bitcoin Core ever send `getblocks`. It's used today mainly by lightweight nodes which have set a filter. And even long ago, `getblocks` was used only for the initial sync. There are several other methods of block propagation that are used instead.
But a peer will never forward a block that it believes is in a shorter valid chain. So if you invalidate a block that nobody else invalidates, then you will indeed be isolating yourself. What else would you expect? Executing invalidateblock is sort of like doing your own little softfork, but if nobody else does it, then you're stuck on your own single-person currency. The command is intended for testing/debugging or certain emergency situations (in which everyone would be instructed to run invalidateblock on the *same* block, and you'd hopefully end up with at least a few like-minded peers). You're not supposed to run it willy-nilly and expect things to keep working.
In my previous response above, I said to run reconsiderblock right after invalidateblock. This causes the invalidateblock to be undone. You don't keep the invalidateblock up permanently.
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:56:21

I've long believed that 2 MB is basically safe (ie. it won't cause fatal centralization), though perhaps not ideal. See [here]( for example.
Some people were somewhat opposed to 2 MB until now because it is a rather significant increase in bandwidth, but these people were convinced that the decentralization-encouraging aspects of SegWit and the other roadmap items would more than offset the decentralization-damaging aspects.
It's possible that without the SegWit softfork, consensus would be forming around a 2 MB hardfork right now. I don't think there are very many experts who would say that 2 MB would be fatally dangerous now, though many would say that it is unnecessary and setting a bad precedent of making changes due to politics rather than good technical reasons. But the SegWit softfork is superior to a 2 MB hardfork in every way, and extremely useful even ignoring the capacity increase, so consensus for a 2 MB hardfork is impossible now.

It's fundamentally impossible to trustlessly tie a coin's value to a non-crypto asset (eg. USD, gold, etc.). Anyone who claims to do so is lying. Unless you can put a human-level AI into a decentralized computing system, a decentralized system can under no circumstances determine an asset's price. Any attempt to do so will rely on external *trusted* sources; you can try using several different sources, and you can put the data through a complex algorithm, but at the end of the day prices have to come from centralized sources.
I never looked into DAI until you just mentioned it; skimming through their stuff, it seems like a horrible mess. They use oracles for prices, as they must, so any idea of decentralization is killed right there. The whole CDP thing looks very fragile, and will probably fall apart quickly. If it ends up working at all, it will probably end up as basically a fiat currency with a central bank and a stated monetary policy goal of achieving 1:1 parity with USD. They seem to be trying to claim that because MKR tokens are used to make central-bank decisions, this makes it decentralized. If that were true, then your PayPal balance could be considered decentralized, since PayPal is ultimately controlled by shareholders who get to vote. Users are trusting *someone*. Even in a hypothetical perfect democratic system, you'd still be trusting the majority, which is *not* trustless in the way that Bitcoin is trustless.

It was already possible to do any Script change via a softfork (Satoshi built this capability into the original version of Script), but this versioning makes it a lot more elegant. Perhaps we will see Script changes a lot more frequently after SegWit.
The SegWit softfork will probably also itself include a few uncontroversial changes to Script such as removing the O(n^2 ) verification problem

The SegWit stuff is built into Bitcoin Core. You won't have to do anything extra to run a 100% full node.
On a related note: A lot of people think that Lightning is supposed to be some separate thing as well, but that's also planned to be transparently added to Bitcoin Core at some point. When you send a transaction, Bitcoin Core will automatically do all of the Lightning stuff for you, and you'll never know that Lightning was involved. You're not going to have to juggle between two separate wallets or anything like that -- that'd be terrible.


Right, there's not much difference in *capacity/costs* between SegWit and setting MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB. The advantage is that SegWit has a ton of extra features (eg. eliminating malleability) and it's a softfork, which makes it easier.
Future max block size increases beyond what SegWit provides may well be done via softforks as well. There is a certain "kludge factor" to this, but it's a lot smoother/easier.


It's already written, and it's fewer lines of code than BIP 101. Some testing is still necessary, but as the FAQ mentions, it will be ready early next year.

This is nonsense. Old nodes will continue enforcing the rules they signed up for, and are free to continue sending old-style, non-SegWit transactions if they wish. (SegWit transactions will just be cheaper, since they're smaller.)

The list of signers contains the people responsible for the vast majority of work on Bitcoin Core in recent times (as well as several notable non-Core-devs), so it seems that this is Bitcoin Core's final word for now on the scaling issue.
* Very soon libsecp256k1 will be used for verification, which speeds up initial sync time by 400%-700% and reduces CPU load for all full nodes.
* A segregated witness softfork will be done ASAP (within 3-6 months, probably). This will at least double the effective transaction capacity (ie. it is equal to or better than BIP 102), and at the same time it will provide features important for safely scaling even more in the future.
* There will not be any hardfork for at least the next ~year.
* To pave the way for scalable hardfork max block size increases (which will *eventually* be necessary), and because it is already dearly needed, improved block/tx broadcasting technology such as weak blocks and IBLT will be implemented, hopefully soon after SegWit.
* The BIPs necessary for efficient deployment of Lightning are already in the pipeline and should be rolled out in 2016. Lightning will allow for almost all of the security, features, and decentralization of Bitcoin transactions while drastically reducing the number of on-blockchain transactions that each individual will need to perform. This is expected to be the real eventual solution to scaling.
The above is my interpretation. You can [read the more detailed roadmap for yourself]( Also, a detailed FAQ on all of this is currently being written.

There's no perfect way. AFAIK the best thing you could do would be to sign a message from the input addresses of the transactions sending the BTC into cold storage. Or maybe attach a quantum-resistant public key to the transaction with OP_RETURN, and sign with that. Neither of these are 100% conclusive, but maybe it'd be convincing to future treasure hunters when combined with the fact that the money actually hasn't moved for decades.
Hopefully in the future Bitcoin will be extended to support quantum-resistant crypto natively. (This can be done with a softfork, in the same way as CLTV.)

Another common misconception about Lightning is that it is centralized. It's not. There are no hubs. You won't have to create a relationship with some bank, and you're not trusting anyone with your money. You won't need to open an account with anyone, or give up your identity, or even have an email address. You won't have to pay fees to anyone other than Bitcoin miners and maybe equal, non-hub Lightning-network peers.
AFAICT, once Lightning is widespread, the main reasons that you might want to eschew Lightning and do a direct block chain transaction are:
* You want to spend almost all of the money in your wallet, so it doesn't make sense to open a channel.
* You're making a very large one-time transaction and you don't think that expanding your existing channel(s) will be worthwhile.
* You're making a very large transaction and you're worried about it getting tied up. (If your trading partner disappears or turns evil, the money in your channel with them can get stuck for a while.)

Yes. I endorse Rand Paul for president. He's not perfect, but I think that he's the only candidate who would be pretty good. For example, all of the mainstream candidates except for Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders are very pro-war. (And Sanders' other positions are mostly terrible.) War is the biggest problem: for the economy, our security, and morality-wise. I've been watching Rand Paul for many years now, and while he's definitely been playing politics, I do very much believe that he is his father's son at heart.
I'm not very optimistic about his chances, but you never know. Especially if the economy significantly worsens, he might pick up steam again. Ron Paul actually didn't do too badly last time.
On the other hand, I don't really recommend wasting time with politics. Change the world by following Satoshi's example, not by expending effort in trying to change a political system inherently almost immune to change. But if you're going to vote or debate presidential candidates with people or whatever, I'd recommend supporting Rand Paul.

Lightning requires that users make occasional Bitcoin transactions, so certainly not all. All Lightning transactions are valid Bitcoin transactions, and eventually they need to make their way to the Bitcoin block chain -- basically, the trick of Lightning is in realizing that many transactions across the network will "cancel out" and therefore don't need to be published on the block chain. I imagine that by default Core will do transactions via Lightning, but if you want some or all of your transactions to immediately go to the block chain, you'll be able to do so. In some cases Core might even ask you how you want an outgoing transaction to be handled, such as for particularly large transactions.
In other words: Yes, all transactions will be going directly through Blockstream's Lightning control center at their secret base in the Earth's core, where a small, reasonable percentage will be automatically extracted so that Blockstream can continue their noble effort to protect and lead Bitcoin (and later, humanity) for all eternity.

Lightning is not company-specific. It is an open source project like Bitcoin.

Months after Poon and Dryja published the Lightning whitepaper, Blockstream hired Rusty to work on Lightning, but Lightning remains independent.

I can sort of understand why Changetip got funding. Their site is pretty awesome. I feel like they're doing everything they can. But it's just not working. I guess people don't care about tipping very much, maybe even less than they did a couple years ago. And this fee is going to make it a lot worse. I'd be surprised if changetip isn't replaced by some competing bot on Reddit pretty soon, TBH.
One interesting thing they do is that they build a sort of "trust profile" on you based on your social network and then use this to allow you to buy BTC with credit cards (you can't let untrusted people buy with credit cards because you'll get too much chargeback fraud). In fact, I think that they might be the easiest way of buying small amounts of BTC right now. Maybe they should extend more in that direction.

If 90% of Bitcoin full nodes are also Rootstock full nodes, and they reject a block containing a Rootstock-&gt;Bitcoin transaction which is illegal due to rules in the Rootstock chain, then the Bitcoin network will split into two incompatible pieces. 90% of full nodes will accept the block, and 10% will reject it. If Bitcoin miners are mining on the non-Rootstock side (this is probably unlikely in this scenario, but possible), then the split can be maintained indefinitely. This would be really really bad for Bitcoin, even with a 90%-10% split. So even when Bitcoin full nodes are able to verify sidechain transactions at a deeper level, they can't.
It is on the other hand pretty easy to require with a softfork that all Bitcoin full nodes must also be full nodes on one or more sidechains and enforce that sidechain's rules. This will probably be done if the vast majority of Bitcoin full nodes are also full nodes on some sidechain. This is a good way to add sweeping new changes to Bitcoin: first create a (reduced-security) sidechain and see if it works well over the course of a few years, and then make this sidechain mandatory to bring its security back up to Bitcoin's level. In this way the core of Bitcoin gets the maximum possible security, while also allowing even very complex changes to be added and used right away. (But I'm not so confident that merged-mining provides enough security even for this testing/transition period, unless the sidechain doesn't contain much BTC. Maybe merged-mining *plus* federated signing.)

Right now, it wouldn't work because connections are essentially random. A lot of people would be connected only to low-bandwidth peers, and bottlenecks would develop. Maybe the network could be reorganized to support that sort of thing, though this'd require some serious study to avoid creating centralized "supernodes" or allowing attackers with a lot of bandwidth to monopolize people's connections or do other evil things. (The randomness of connections provides some protection from these attacks.) AFAIK there hasn't been much study in this area because it is very complicated and hard to measure, though I do think that it is a possible solution. Right now the focus is on weak blocks and to a lesser extent IBLT, which are easier to analyze and will at least in the average case significantly improve the bandwidth/latency issue. I'd very tentatively guess that given weak blocks, most experts would agree to at least twice the max block size that they would agree to normally.

How non-federated 2-way peg works (more-or-less) is that when you send bitcoins into a sidechain, you send bitcoins to an output script `&lt;sidechain parameters&gt; OP_SIDECHAIN`. (Where OP_SIDECHAIN is a new opcode that hasn't yet been added to Bitcoin. New opcodes can be added as a softfork.) Then you send a copy of this transaction as a separate transaction on the sidechain and all sidechain full nodes verify that the bitcoins were actually locked on the Bitcoin block chain. Then you have those bitcoins on the sidechain, and you can do whatever you want with them there.
When whoever owns the sidechain version of these bitcoins finally wants to remove them from the sidechain, they first send a transaction on the sidechain doing this, and then they send a Bitcoin transaction spending the previously-locked bitcoins with a scriptSig of `&lt;headers&gt; &lt;merkle branch&gt; &lt;sidechain transaction&gt;`, where "sidechain transaction" is the previously-sent sidechain transaction returning BTC to Bitcoin and "headers" and "merkle branch" are an SPV proof that the given transaction was mined into a sidechain block and is *[some constant]* blocks deep.
All Bitcoin full nodes will then verify that the given headers actually do extend the genesis block given in the original OP_SIDECHAIN chain params, that the merkle branch connects the sidechain transaction to a suitably-deep header, and that the sidechain transaction (which must be at least partially in some universal format) actually does permit the release of bitcoins to some given Bitcoin address. **However**, Bitcoin full nodes do not verify that the sidechain transaction is in any way legal on the sidechain. They don't check that it's a double-spend, or that the inputs of the transaction are actually valid on the sidechain, or anything like that. To check these things, you need to be a full node on the sidechain, and the whole point of sidechains is to allow people to be full nodes on Bitcoin without being full nodes on all sidechains ever made. Bitcoin full nodes only verify that transactions are deep enough in the sidechain's block chain, trusting the majority of sidechain mining power to enforce whatever the sidechain's rules actually are. Therefore, a majority of sidechain miners can get *any* transaction deep enough into the sidechain's block chain, including a transaction sending all BTC deposited in the sidechain to themselves. This will be happily accepted by Bitcoin full nodes, who will have no way of distinguishing between this transaction and a normal, legal transaction, and the attacker will get all of the sidechain's bitcoins.

If an altcoin has features that are useful and without tradeoffs, then Bitcoin should adopt those features. Most new features can be added with a softfork. If there are massive tradeoffs (like Monero-style ring signatures), these features can be done on a sidechain.
Because Bitcoin is adaptable like this, probably the only way that an altcoin could gain much traction is if it was a substantially better *currency* than Bitcoin (eg. it has a substantially better money-creation schedule).

I suppose that you have one UTXO of value ~12 BTC and ~1600 UTXOs of value ~0 BTC. If you try to send everything in your wallet, then it tries to use all UTXOs, which makes a too-large transaction. If you try to send 0.1 BTC, it ignores the largest UTXO and groups up a ton of the miniscule ones, still resulting on a too-large transaction. Bitcoin Core's default UTXO selection tries to *minimize the value of the change output* (though there are big changes to this in 0.17), so it's not going to use a 12 BTC UTXO for a 0.1 BTC transaction in your case.
* Use the latest Bitcoin Core if you're not already.
* Send just slightly less than the total value of your highest-value UTXOs.
* Send smaller amounts than the 0.01 BTC you've already tried in order to clear out the tiny UTXOs. You should eventually find a value small enough to work.
* Use manual coin selection as others have suggested.

So if the majority of miners decide to steal everyone's bitcoins, that'd be OK? Why do we even have full nodes, then?
Bitcoin is not ruled by miners (or anyone). Your full node will follow the rules *no matter what*, even if every other miner and node on the network disagrees. Similarly, bitcoin.org should do what's right no matter what, even if this is unpopular.

You'll always be able to see the signatures of incoming transactions. If you can't, then Bitcoin would be badly broken. When your wallet receives transactions, whoever sends the transaction will include the segregated signatures along with it.
It's possible that many years in the future everyone on the network will forget the signatures of transactions that are really old. Then it won't be possible to 100% verify the entire Bitcoin block chain. But I don't think that this is a significant loss of security; everyone will *know* that the distant history of the current chain is valid.


Full nodes won't accept new blocks without valid signatures. If miners include an invalid transaction, full nodes will reject it; either because the miner doesn't send the signatures along with his block, or because the signatures are invalid.
Bitcoin is not a democracy. The idea is that you should ideally run your own full node. Then your node will do what's right no matter what, even if everyone else on the network is breaking the rules. SW offers the additional possibility of SPV nodes receiving and verifying fraud proofs from full nodes, which would cause them to reject a longer invalid chain. Fraud proofs are also not democratic: SPV nodes only need to receive one valid fraud proof in order to act on it. But indeed, the fraud proof system might not work very well if an attacker can compromise the overall structure of the network by creating tons of fake nodes or whatever, so it'll always be more secure to run a full node.


If you don't run a node at all, you'll have to use some centralized website. Probably block explorer sites will store all of the signatures when they download them.
If you're willing to connect to the Bitcoin network, you should always be able to download at least the last couple years of transactions+signatures. Probably how it'll work in the future is that each full node will store ~1% of all transactions and signatures, so you'll have to find a node that has what you want. There'll be some mechanism for figuring out which nodes have what -- you won't have to just search blindly.

With centralized payment processors, your payment just requires a few edits to a database on a server somewhere. This is really efficient. With Bitcoin, every node on the network needs to receive and cryptographically verify your transaction, and then your transaction needs to be mined by an amazingly powerful computing network. This makes Bitcoin extremely inefficient compared to entities like PayPal, but as far as anyone knows, all of this inefficiency is necessary for decentralization.
To fix this, in the future there will probably be a semi-centralized "caching layer" built on top of Bitcoin to allow fast and cheap payments. Using Bitcoin smart contracts, you can do this without giving the centralized servers any opportunity to steal your money.

The most important difference is that the DAO situation was a bailout of a private organization and a deviation from expected system behavior, whereas in this case an unexpected bug in the system would be uncontroversially undone. Nobody on Earth is going to seriously suggest that because of this bug, Bitcoin should now allow anyone to print as much BTC as they want. Similarly, if a bug in Script was found which allowed you to spend anyone's BTC, and this was exploited, then it would be totally justified to undo all of those theft transactions.
You want to minimize this sort of manual intervention, firstly because it's just very disruptive, and secondly because in large part the point of Bitcoin is to remove fallible humans from this stuff. But economics/money is an inherently human thing, and furthermore nobody knows how to make bug-free software yet, so from time to time these sorts of manual adjustments have been and will continue to be necessary.
The ability to make manual changes is what allows us to say that Bitcoin isn't ruled by miners. If "the code was king", then miners could softfork in anything they wanted (including certain types of evil denial-of-service+sidechain schemes which could be viewed as subsidy increases), and Bitcoin absolutely would be ruled by miners. This *isn't* the case only because we can hardfork to a different PoW in the event of such an attack by miners.
A less philosophically-important but more practically-important difference between this and the DAO incident is that this was a softfork, so:
* It has very clear precedent in the value overflow incident, which was a similar bug resolved in a similar softfork, though in that case some blocks were *actually* deleted / rolled back.
* Only a majority of miners and/or an economic supermajority need to upgrade in order for everyone to be protected. You don't need *literally everyone* to upgrade.
* In the aftermath of an attack, the end result would look like a long reorg, which is within the realm of expected system behavior. Risk is related to number of confirmations, in the end you get a consistent block chain with consistent transaction chains, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:51:39
If it can be done safely, the max block size should be increased in that case. (And in general, the max block size should be as large as safely possible.) If the max block size is at the maximum safe size, then we shouldn't abandon the decentralization, security, etc. of the base Bitcoin system in order to achieve lower fees. We should instead look for some other solution.
One avenue for solutions would to increase centralization at higher levels. Lightning has basically the same level of decentralization and security as Bitcoin itself, but you can increase centralization to improve efficiency. For example, a hub-and-spoke payment channel network would probably significantly reduce the number of channel-create transactions each person would have to do, since each person would probably rely on only one hub. (Lightning on the other hand doesn't have any hubs.) If even that is too much, we can do blinded bearer certificates; in combination with multisig and other Bitcoin smart contracts, this can be sufficiently secure for everyday usage, and certainly far more secure and transparent than the traditional banking system, *as long as the core Bitcoin network is secure*. And everyone would still have the option of using the lower-level system for more high-security things.
Another avenue for solutions would be more cleverness. For example:
* Implementing IBLT and/or weak blocks would probably allow twice-larger (or more) safe max block sizes.
* It might be reasonably safe to distribute verification so that each node only verifies 1% of transactions or something and produces a fraud proof informing the rest of the network when any inconsistency is found. (SegWit will make this possible - it's not possible now.) This reduces the system's security, but maybe by only an acceptable very small amount.
* I think that it might be possible to do multiple layers of something like Lightning.
Bitcoin would have to grow very explosively for full deployment of Lightning to hit the max block size if Lightning ends up working as expected, though. Of the things mentioned above, I think that only IBLT + weak blocks are likely to actually be necessary. And certainly I don't advocate these sub-optimal solutions if they can be safely avoided. But there's definitely tons of room for emergency growth if necessary - "there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept".
@_date: 2015-12-06 04:58:48
The problem is that if a block is published and it contains many previously-unseen transactions, then everyone on the network needs to *quickly* (within 30 seconds or so) download and upload (maybe to *several* peers) all of the new transactions in this block. So if for example many miners start accepting tons of transactions that most full nodes won't relay, then we could end up in a situation where peers are often having to upload ~8 MB * ~7 peers in 30 seconds, which is no good.
Miners use a separate relay network to talk amongst themselves, so they don't need to worry about orphan rate here. Miners will always build off of whatever chain is the longest, and the non-miner network will catch up eventually.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:38:12
Miners are employees of the network, nothing more. If they break the rules, their blocks (and therefore mined coins) will be rejected by all full nodes. If one miner gets too powerful or the majority of mining power does a 51% attack, the PoW algorithm will be changed and their hardware will be turned into paperweights.
If you mine, feel free to mine too-large blocks. In fact, convince all of your miner friends to do so. 75%, no problem. I will laugh as you start mining coins that no one will accept.


No, miners signal their readiness for it. If miners refuse, Bitcoin Core can and will do it without them. It's just a little more messy in that case. (This exact thing was discussed in  this weekend with many of the devs/experts; I wonder if it was logged.)

The most important thing is for *something* to remain decentralized. Then we can build other things on top of that. I hope that Lighting is decentralized, but if not, we'll be able to try something else as long as Bitcoin is still secure and decentralized.

Yeah, me neither. Sidechains only have SPV-level security, so if a sidechain gets big and is holding a lot of BTC, then the majority of miners on that sidechain can work together to steal all of these bitcoins. This will destroy the sidechain and prevent future mining fees, but probably it'll be very much worthwhile overall for the miners to do this. This can't happen on Bitcoin due to the existence of full nodes, which follow the rules no matter what: If the majority of Bitcoin mining power tried to steal bitcoins from someone, then they would succeed in stealing bitcoins from the perspective of SPV wallets, but most of the economy is (or should be...) backed by full nodes, so any coins miners misappropriate in this way will be mostly worthless. Due to the way sidechains work, sidechain full nodes have to follow the majority of mining power, whereas with Bitcoin, full nodes can and do ignore miners when they break the rules. (This is why full nodes are so important in Bitcoin and Bitcoin experts get really worried when the node count is falling: if the economy is not substantially backed by full nodes, miners would have *every incentive* to steal bitcoins from people.) Furthermore, for sidechains that have very little mining power (maybe because they don't offer much or any incentive to mine on them), the merged-mining allows Bitcoin miners/pools to attack the sidechain in this way very easily and almost for free.
Therefore, AFAICT sidechains are only useful for small-value things, situations in which federated peg is acceptable, or testing in preparation for adding features to Bitcoin. Rootstock is taking the second route: their Federation will need to approve all transactions going in or out of the sidechain, and they could steal all bitcoins in the sidechain (maybe they'd also need the cooperation of the majority of Rootstock miners to steal bitcoins - I'm not sure). This doesn't mean that Rootstock won't be useful, especially if the Federation is composed of many trustworthy independent entities, but complete decentralization would be ideal.

Go to Help -&gt; Debug -&gt; Console tab. You'll need to use some advanced commands in this console to do multisig. For documentation on any command, type `help PUT_COMMAND_HERE`.
You'll want to:
* Use `addmultisigaddress` to create the multisig address. People will send BTC to this address. All of the participants in the multisig should do the exact same `addmultisigaddress` command before any money is sent to the address.
* After you've received BTC, use `createrawtransaction` to create the spend transaction. `listunspent` will help you find the correct inputs for the transaction.
* Pass the hex-encoded raw transaction to the necessary number of people who need to sign it, and have them use `signrawtransaction` on it, passing the signed hex transaction to the next person.
This is all a bit complicated right now, unfortunately. I don't know of any wallet or bitcoind front-end with a good GUI for it, though maybe one exists.

Basically, blocks are broken up into two separate files: one has the transactions minus signatures, and one has just the signatures. Full nodes download and verify **both**, so security isn't reduced. It's *segregated* witness, not *deleted* witness.
The advantages of sipa's particular SW proposal are:
* It eliminates malleability.
* It allows for future protocol enhancements which would allow full nodes to generate fraud proofs that lightweight nodes can verify. In other words, as long as SPV nodes are able to connect to some honest full nodes, SPV nodes will have close to the same level of security as full nodes. This is how Satoshi originally intended SPV to work (see the original paper), but due to some problems with the protocol it wasn't previously possible.
* When you're downloading the entire historical block chain, you might choose to download and verify only 1% of signatures or something, which would reduce the initial sync time by 50% or more. Combined with fraud proofs, this is almost as secure as verifying all historical signatures (which Bitcoin Core doesn't do right now anyway - it downloads but ignores signatures before the latest checkpoint).
* As a side-effect, it allows the max block size to be increased to about 4 MB with a *softfork*. But the problem of substantially increased bandwidth requirements for full nodes isn't addressed by SW, so maybe only about 2 MB is safe without something like IBLT. But still, it's very likely that *this is how the max block size is going to be increased*.

Do you know which manufacturers added an alt PoW to their ASICs? If there are many such ASICs floating around, changing Bitcoin's PoW would be a lot less damaging to security.
I also think that the PoW should probably be changed if mining centralization doesn't improve over the next couple of years (or if there are any actual attacks). Probably mining will still become centralized again eventually, but it'll improve things for a while at least.

If all of the core devs are OK with it, then I'd have to very seriously consider the possibility that I am wrong and the core devs are right (this would be very likely in this scenario).

That change is sometimes not considered a hard fork because 0.7 and older weren't behaving sanely/consistently. Apparently, sometimes ("randomly") a 0.7 node could even reject a block produced by another 0.7 node, with larger blocks being more likely to be rejected. See:  
But in any case, it's at least very similar to how a hardfork would work. It demonstrates that a hardfork can be decided on in hours and deployed in weeks if there's a big enough emergency.

Bitcoin isn't a democracy. A full node will follow its rules no matter what. So if you're using Bitcoin Core, you will *completely reject* any block chain that contains a block larger than 1 MB, even if *everyone else on Earth* is using XT. So even if 80% of miners move to XT and this triggers XT's hardfork, the majority of *Bitcoin users* can still be affected.
After the hardfork in XT is actually triggered and the block chain forks, there will be three types of transactions:
1. Transactions spending only pre-fork coins. These will be confirmed on both networks and the resulting coins will remain pre-fork coins.
2. Transactions spending *any* xt-coins. These will be confirmed only on the XT network, and the outputs will become xt-coins. The pre-fork inputs remain unspent on the Bitcoin network.
3. Transactions spending *any* post-fork BTC. These will be confirmed only on the Bitcoin network, and the outputs will become post-fork BTC. The pre-fork inputs remain unspent on the XT network.
(Post-fork BTC and xt-coins come into existence by mining on their respective chains.)
Neither Bitcoin Core nor Bitcoin XT will pay any attention to these differences, and will by default select inputs at random.
If someone using XT wants to deposit to an exchange, the exchange must either be using XT or the user must send only pre-fork BTC. If the exchange is on the Bitcoin network and the XT user sends pre-fork BTC, then when the user goes to withdraw, the withdrawal will probably fail because the EWallet will probably use some post-fork BTC as an input; the user will need to start using Bitcoin again to access the money. If it doesn't fail, then the user has the same number of pre-fork BTC. If the exchange is on the XT network, then when the user goes to withdraw he will usually get all xt-coins, since the only case in which he would get any pre-fork BTC is if *all* inputs are pre-fork BTC, which is probably unlikely. As a result, the XT user will usually unknowingly trade pre-fork BTC for xt-coins. This is the same but reversed for Bitcoin network users/exchanges.
The same thing happens in more normal trades, though in two steps (sell+buy) and over a longer period of time.
If you're careful, you can spend pre-fork BTC on both networks. This is terrible for fungibility (an essential property of any money): if the XT fork becomes at all popular, we'll have traders pricing things as "1 pre-fork BTC or 1.1 post-fork BTC or 20 xt-coins", which is annoying and not how the software is set up to work. It will also severely exacerbate the above problem because smart traders and exchanges will try to keep pre-fork BTC when possible. If an XT user deposits a mixture of xt-coins and pre-fork BTC to an exchange, the smart exchange will intentionally avoid sending him any pre-fork BTC back when he withdraws.
So if you use XT after the hardfork is triggered, any money you receive will almost certainly be xt-coins, not pre-fork BTC. Any money you send has a chance of actually depriving you of pre-fork BTC equal to the value sent (the probability is something *very* roughly like &lt;amount of pre-fork BTC in wallet&gt;/&lt;total money in wallet&gt;) and a chance of basically converting the pre-fork BTC inputs to inconvenient-to-access post-fork BTC (they'll be in your XT wallet, but you'll have to extract the keys and transfer them to Bitcoin wallet software). So a few months after the hardfork is triggered, I'd expect most XT users to have lost at least 5-10% of their bitcoins, with most of the rest not accessible through the XT software. The exact amount of loss depends on how the XT user transacts, how the BTC in his wallet is distributed, etc. -- if he does no transactions then he's not going to lose anything, while if he deposits his whole wallet into an XT exchange and then withdraws it later, he'll probably lose 100% of his bitcoins.

Sorry, I've been thinking about your email but I haven't had a chance to respond yet. My post above somewhat addresses your claims, though: miners are not equal to users, so 75% of miners can switch while only a small percentage of actual Bitcoin users switch. Probably a huge split like 75% of miners vs 1% of users is very unlikely for economic reasons, but something like 75% vs 40% seems likely, and even if it's 75% vs 75%, 25% of users will be on the Bitcoin side (maybe *refusing* to switch, not just ignoring warnings) and will lose money as I described if XT ends up winning.

AFAIK there's no implementation of this opcode yet, but very likely it will be generic only up to the sidechain's block header. So OP_SIDECHAIN sidechains will need to all use a PoW algorithm supported by OP_SIDECHAIN (probably only Bitcoin's sha256d will be supported), and they'll have to have the same structure at a very basic level. But everything else can differ. Merged mining is AFAICT not required. The difficulty retarget method/interval can change.
Federated peg sidechains use the existing OP_CHECKMULTISIG opcode instead. A hybrid would probably use both OP_SIDECHAIN and OP_CHECKMULTISIG in the same script.
One cool thing about Bitcoin's Script is that new opcodes can be added via softfork, and there are very few restrictions on what these opcodes can do. In fact, you could have a OP_NEWSCRIPT opcode that evaluates the top stack item using a completely new and arbitrarily-complex language. So it'd definitely be possible to create a sidechain opcode that is totally generic, where you could give it an exact specification of the hash algorithms, etc. used by the sidechain. But probably the extra complexity of this makes it not at all worthwhile.

Because a huge-block-size fork happening in the near future is far more dangerous than some *possible*, reversible denial of service in a couple years which might be fixed by Lightning or other technology before it actually happens. While I believe that Bitcoin can probably *survive* even 20 MB blocks, there is a significant risk that such large blocks will push out too many full nodes and put Bitcoin permanently on the path of centralization.


I don't have any such plans, and hopefully no such bias. I have basically no objection to 2-4 MB blocks, and I'd probably support that right now if it had expert consensus. If there are serious problems in the future, I hope that I notice them and vigorously support a conservative max block size increase.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:01:14
That's planned to be answered in great detail by the FAQ. The FAQ will be posted to Reddit separately when it's done, maybe in a few days.
In short: Very large block size increases are considered by most experts to be totally unsafe because they make it too difficult for people to run full nodes. Without enough of the economy backed by full nodes, Bitcoin is totally insecure (see [here]( and [here]( 2 MB is generally regarded as reasonably safe, but since SegWit basically increases the max block size to 2 MB by itself, and it offers a number of other huge advantages, and it only requires a softfork (which is a lot easier/quicker than a hardfork), there's really no reason to do an increase to 2 MB except via a SegWit softfork.
"Just raising the limit" is scaling without scalability. It's like raising the official max capacity of an aircraft without ensuring that it can actually carry the extra weight.

Agreed, an ETF will almost certainly turn into a disaster at some point. The coins will be stolen, forks will be handled controversially, there will be issues with fungibility (eg. someone will "trace stolen coins" to the ETF's stash), the world will freak out when a bunch of retirees lose their life savings after doing the equivalent of buying BTC at $20k, etc. etc. It'll also get the sort of people who love regulation more into BTC, which is never good.
But investors want it, so it'll probably happen eventually. In particular, I totally condemn trying to get regulators to interfere in the free market more than they already do by blocking any ETF. (When the SEC was last looking into this, I had actually written a long document that I was going to send to them in order to comment on many technical issues with their proposed Bitcoin ETF regulation, but I decided not to send it because I don't want to have even the slightest hand in regulations.)
An ETF probably will increase the price a lot (until the ETF suffers its near-inevitable catastrophe), which has some pros and cons.
Note that an ETF can't affect Bitcoin itself, just the ETF investors and the market. There is no voting of any sort in Bitcoin, so it's not as if holding a lot of BTC gives you any power over Bitcoin, for example. I do agree with Andreas that the creation of a "corpo-Bitcoin" seems probable, perhaps after the ETF loses a ton of BTC and wants to undo it.

Treating Satoshi's posts as absolute gospel is especially silly since Satoshi may well have changed his mind by now. I also [used to think that a "backbone" of full nodes would be inevitable and OK]( but thinking about something for 5 years can often change one's mind.

(IANAL...) The legal situation isn't clear here. It seems that the laws assume that one party to this sort of transaction will always be a business (requiring a MSB license and the need to follow AML regulations) and the other party will be a customer. It's not clear to me what happens when two people are very obviously both doing occasional trades that aren't part of any trading business, but it might be possible for the courts to decide that *someone* needs to be the "business" here, and it makes most sense in this case for the person accepting USD to fill this role (since AML regulations apply mainly to USD receipts). Therefore, I consider it somewhat risky to sell BTC P2P in the US, especially if you do it frequently or in large amounts, and it's completely crazy to try to make regular profit from both buying and selling in P2P trades. Several people actually have been arrested for this.
It's utterly ridiculous that you need a license to buy or sell *anything*, of course. Hopefully someday the Bitcoin economy will grow to the point where it will only very rarely be necessary to convert BTC to fiat. The best way IMO to get rid of stupid anti-freedom regulations is to make their enforcement extremely expensive, and that's possible with Bitcoin. (Though anonymity/privacy technology both in Bitcoin and in the broader ecosystem is currently far from acceptable.)

Depends on what you're doing. You should never store much money at all on a live server. If users only ever pay to your site, and can't withdraw, you should either automatically &amp; frequently sweep the live wallet to some cold-storage wallet or else generate the addresses ahead of time and use bitcoind's watch-only address feature.
If users can also withdraw, then making it secure becomes a lot more complicated. You should avoid this if at all possible. Maybe only do withdrawals manually. Under no circumstances should you allow large amounts of user money to accumulate on a live server. Nor should you allow the live server to order a "cold-storage" computer to blindly send bitcoins to the live server or elsewhere. (You can set up an insecure web wallet using bitcoind's accounts feature in like an hour, but *don't*.)
You shouldn't use bitcoind's JSON-RPC across untrusted networks. If it's on a local machine or a trusted LAN, that's fine. If you want to have your bitcoind located across the Internet, ssh port forwarding would be a good option. Using bitcoind's built-in rpcssl feature isn't recommended.
As for the usage of PHP itself: Many big Bitcoin sites were/are written in PHP, and *some* of them remained secure. You can write secure code in PHP, though it's probably more difficult than in other languages. The trickier problems will be issues that are independent of language. For example, one big issue that you need to worry about is atomicity: if you want to both subtract a user's balance in a database and send some bitcoins on their behalf, you must ensure that either both of these things happen or neither of them happen, even in the face of a server crash or a user aborting the PHP script. If you're not already very familiar with this stuff, then whatever you write is *going* to be vulnerable to some attack like this, so you'll just have to set things up so that it doesn't damage you too much when someone figures out how to trick your site into doing something stupid.
It's very simple to use bitcoind's JSON-RPC via PHP. No external libraries are necessary. For example, here's some code I wrote for it. In production use you'd want to improve the error handling.
    function rpcQuery($method,$params=array())

SegWit provides almost exactly the same increases in capacity *and costs on full nodes* as a hardfork to 2 MB blocks. Therefore, a hardfork to 2 MB main-blocks using the planned byte-counting scheme for SegWit would result in an effective total max block size of ~4 MB, which is not viewed as safe. **SegWit** ***is*** **the 2 MB increase.**
As for increases beyond that, the roadmap says:

Gavin's proposal is early next year. I don't think that blocks will be much more full by then. From the graph, it seems that growth is pretty slow. (And now that I look at the graph more closely, it seems that blocks are only about 30% full of good transactions. The rest can be filtered out if necessary.)
I'm inclined to wait until problems actually occur or seem likely in the short-term because:
* I'm not yet sure how large blocks can be before Bitcoin becomes too centralized. It seems possible that even an increase to 2 MB would be quite damaging, though probably not any sort of doomsday scenario. Until the network's capacity can be determined with some certainty, it seems prudent to make only the most conservative changes, and only when it is quite necessary. Gavin's 8MB-&gt;8GB proposal is especially imprudent.
* There are a wide variety of technical enhancements in development which might make it less necessary or more obviously safe to increase the max block size to ~8 MB. If any of this stuff gets completed before blocks start becoming very full, then that'll make it easier to choose a correct max block size.
* Full blocks would probably not be a major problem, only resulting in slightly increased transaction fees until the max block size is increased.

(On the other hand, the mining algorithm definitely should be changed despite this if centralization increases too far -- allowing some miner to completely monopolize the network would be accepting defeat.)
The current situation is definitely not good, though this is *not* an easy problem to solve. I can pretty much guarantee that unless you think about this very deeply for a very long time, all of the potential solutions you'll come up with already have been discussed ad nauseam and determined to be worse than the status quo.

It's good to be a bit paranoid about this sort of thing, but it's not difficult to figure out what this command does and become confident that it's safe. In particular, you can type `help getrawtransaction` into the Bitcoin Core RPC Console to get detailed documentation:
    getrawtransaction "txid" ( verbose )
    
    NOTE: By default this function only works sometimes. This is when the tx is in the mempool
    or there is an unspent output in the utxo for this transaction. To make it always work,
    you need to maintain a transaction index, using the -txindex command line option.
    
    Return the raw transaction data.
    
    If verbose=0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for 'txid'.
    If verbose is non-zero, returns an Object with information about 'txid'.
    
    Arguments:
    1. "txid"      (string, required) The transaction id
    2. verbose       (numeric, optional, default=0) If 0, return a string, other return a json object

For the Bitcoin network to function properly, everyone on the network needs to usually be able to download blocks 30-60 seconds after they are published. Maybe you can download 8 MB in that amount of time, but where are you downloading it from? Can you upload 8 MB to each of your 8+ peers in 30 seconds? I don't think that most people can, so I'd expect that the network's *collective upload capacity* is insufficient for 8MB blocks.
There are also issues with CPU and storage costs. The FAQ will have more details.
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:59:05
If the max block size *actually* causes serious problems (which does not seem at all likely to me in the next 1-2 years), then it should be easy to get consensus to do an emergency hardfork to something more conservative like 2 MB. Hardforks can be done in as little time as a few weeks if necessary (though more time is desirable).

Probably a hardware wallet like Trezor would be best for you, then. Or you should run Core on a separate, usually-offline computer. Desktop wallets like Core all have the huge weakness that if you get malware on your computer, it can very easily steal your whole wallet.
Bitcoin Core is what allows you to "be your own bank". If you don't run Core, you're trusting someone else to give you accurate data. Also, Core is probably the wallet least likely to contain any bugs that could lose you money, it has some of the best privacy characteristics (when used properly), and it has many very advanced features. For these reasons, businesses should definitely have Core somewhere in their infrastructure. But it's currently not so kind to people unfamiliar with Bitcoin.

Right. If Lightning becomes widespread, any good wallet would integrate Lightning and Bitcoin seamlessly.

Miners don't have much incentive to keep sizes small, especially with something like IBLT. If miners can fill up 8 MB blocks (or whatever) with fee-paying transactions, then I'd expect them to do so. Probably this many transactions wouldn't be generated right away, but in general excess supply breeds demand, so probably many people would start doing stupid things like storing data on the block chain if they could.

No, he talks about how UTXO commitments aren't necessary. (UTXO commitments are very expensive for miners and UTXO-set-based fraud proofs are large.) Rather, witnesses must contain the block number of the txout that they're spending. Then you can prove that a tx creates money out of thin air by providing the Merkle tree of that block number and showing that the tx hash doesn't exist there.

@_date: 2015-06-21 08:23:24
Yeah, it's called fees. Miners fill blocks with the highest fee-per-KB transactions they can, more-or-less, and usually they won't accept more than a handful of free transactions even if their blocks aren't full. So if this spam is free transactions, then all it's going to do is block other free transactions for a while. If the spam pays fees, then legitimate transactions will still be able to get through by paying larger fees or waiting until the spammer runs out of money.
Also, Bitcoin Core by default will only relay so many free transactions before it starts dropping them for a while. Legitimate transaction senders and recipients periodically resend their unconfirmed transactions, so this isn't a big problem.
When people measure increased delays for free transactions during the "stress test", that's the network working as intended. It's not any sort of indication of a problem. If every transaction got included immediately, then an attacker could send gigabytes of transactions per day and force everyone to store them forever.

PoS is known to be broken, so that wouldn't be used. If rogue miners were causing problems, then security would have already been hurt too much to continue with the old PoW. Changing PoW would be a very minor issue without much opposition (except from the rogue miners) in that situation, I expect.
ASIC manufacturers were actually advised to put a non-public alternate PoW algorithm (a slight modification of SHA-256d, different per manufacturer) into their hardware just in case something like this was necessary. This way individual rogue manufacturers can be removed without affecting the others. Though I've heard that most of the recent ASICs haven't done this. So perhaps only the newest generation of ASICs without the alt PoW would be made useless, though it depends on where the attack originates.
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:32:41
That looks correct.
A lot of people think that you can follow some specific coin from its generation to now, but you can't. Each transaction has a number of input coins (where "coin" = unspent tx output) and a number of output coins, and the identities of the inputs are not preserved into the outputs. It's like melting down the (input) coins and using the liquid metal to mint new (output) coins. So dilution makes a lot of sense. Due to this, BTW, taint spreads very quickly -- if you ask "how much BTC around today is tainted by _____", you'll often get a very high percentage of all active BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:39:06
Someone asked Pieter this on IRC, and he mentioned that key recovery is incompatible with batch verification. With batch verification (which is not implemented yet and requires a softfork of its own), you can verify any number of signatures for about half the CPU cost of verifying them one-by-one. CPU cost is also a major bottleneck, so maybe it'd be better to make this optimization rather than increase CPU cost to reduce bandwidth. But maybe not -- it is an option.
Interesting additional facts:
* Since that posts, compressed public keys were implemented. Now most public keys are only 33 bytes.
* Key recovery is already used in Bitcoin signatures. That's why you don't have to supply any real public key when you verify a Bitcoin message: just an address (which is a hash, and unusable as a real public key), a signature, and a message. So the code already exists in Bitcoin Core.

This is part of an email discussion with Gavin in June. Gavin didn't really comment on this part of what I said.
Note that I think that 8 MB (*maybe* up to 16 MB??) would be *basically* safe under those conditions, but probably not ideal.


Contrary to common belief, there's not any consensus on how to do this. IBLT has problems. In particular, it's not really compatible with nodes having different transaction-acceptance policies (vis-à-vis fees, standardness, etc.).
And all of this tech needs to be rolled out *before* any max block size increase.

@_date: 2015-12-28 08:29:20
The network has plenty of capacity. The real problem is that too much of the economy is using lightweight nodes and centralized verification services. You can't fix that by spinning up some nodes somewhere.
Capacity-wise, the main scarce resource is connection slots. By default, Bitcoin Core will allow a maximum of 112 incoming connections. So the network has about 112 * NUMBER_OF_LISTENING_FULL_NODES connection slots. Each online full node uses 8 slots and each online lightweight node uses a smaller number (IIRC 4 is typical). If the network runs out of connection slots, nodes (especially lightweight nodes) won't be able to connect to the network. However, it seems that right now only about 40% of slots are being used. So it's really not something to worry about too much right now.
If you still want to run a node as a "donation" (instead of for your own personal use, which you definitely should do), I'd recommend one node in a trustworthy location, where the server is as much as possible under your own personal control. For example, a computer in your closet would be good. Then set the maxconnections=... setting to a few hundred (note that increasing this significantly increases bandwidth, CPU, disk, and memory requirements -- you may need to experiment to find the right value). Do not modify Core to make more than 8 outbound connections, since this will cause you to *consume* connection slots.

SegWit is pretty similar to increasing the hard limit. The data from doing so should be useful. The main difference is that the actual usability of the additional capacity will occur over some time as wallets gain support for SegWit, rather than all at once.
Several experts have expressed support for eventually combining SegWit with 2-4-8, and this idea/option is mentioned in the roadmap, but it seems unlikely to happen in 2016. Flexcap is also mentioned in the roadmap, but it's possible that flexcap will happen only after 2-4-8, or maybe not at all -- many details of flexcap are still being researched and debated.
Also, if it continues to be difficult to get consensus for hardfork max block size increases, the max block size can be increased arbitrarily with softforks via extension blocks. I personally don't see any problem with this, though I know that a lot of people find it to be kludgy.
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:35:01
Bitcoin is not governed. If there is disagreement in the hard rules of the system, then you by definition end up with two separate &amp; incompatible currencies. In just a few minutes you could modify the code so that it produces unlimited coins, and nobody could stop you. But since your rules are different from everyone else's rules, you've actually created a separate currency. At that point you have to convince everyone else to switch to your currency and call *it* Bitcoin. There is no majority rule, central authority, or other form of governance: you have to convince **everyone** to switch if you don't want some people to continue using old-Bitcoin. Realistically, it's never going to happen for something like changing the money supply. For actually-reasonable changes which are not fundamentally opposed to Bitcoin, it could be done in a slow process over the course of a couple years.
Only Bitcoin's *hard rules* (aka *consensus rules*) get the above treatment. There are less important rules called *policy* which can be changed more easily. For example, adding support for compact blocks was a policy change.
There are also softforks, which is a way of more quickly making changes to the hard rules when the rules are being *tightened*. You can't do softforks when the rules are being loosened. For example, reducing the BTC that will be created in the future could be done as a softfork, while increasing the BTC that will be created in the future could not be.

The stream will now be down for quite a while. There'll be a 60-minute summary of workshops at 18:00 HKT, though probably I won't be awake then, so this might remain stickied for longer than necessary.
There were a lot of great talks. I especially liked the talks about Lightning, IBLT &amp; weak blocks, segregated witness, and flexcap. I am more confident than ever that scaling is unlikely to be a problem long-term.
Probably the biggest news from the conference is that with segregated witness (SW) it'll probably be possible to increase the effective max block size to 2 MB with a **softfork**. And SW is already pretty mature and well-tested, so rolling it out probably won't take all that long. This is likely to actually happen. Also, SW combined with IBLT would allow for a safe effective max block size of ~4 MB using only softforks, though IBLT is further from readiness.

Then there'd be a hardfork on the Bitcoin side to change the PoW and turn these miners' hardware into paperweights. This change, unlike the max block size increase, would not be controversial if the network was experiencing actual problems due to rogue miners.

It really comes down to this:
* If you think that the most important thing is for Bitcoin to be a good, competitive *payment processing network*, then you'll probably support increasing the max block size as far as necessary. Doing so will probably never outright destroy Bitcoin IMO, but it could easily limit decentralization to the point where there are only a few hundred (or maybe even dozen) full nodes in the world.
* If you think that the most important thing is for Bitcoin to remain decentralized, then you'll probably want to make sure that block sizes don't increase so fast that they push out too many full nodes, even if this means compromising Bitcoin's value as a payment processing network. If Bitcoin *can* support many on-chain payments, then that's great, but if not, it'll be acceptable for bitcoins to behave like [stone money]( (ironically, Gavin made this comparison with stone money in a speech several years ago).
I guess you're not sure what you want Bitcoin to be, so you recognize good arguments, but you don't know what people should be arguing *for*.


It's also important *who* agrees. I could easily imagine 95% of miners supporting the hardfork while only 40% of everyday users do. Bitcoin is not ruled by miners (or anyone). In fact, it's far more important what users decide than what miners decide.


To be a constructive full node, you need to be able to *upload* the block to all of your peers (at least 7) in about 30 seconds. If a big chunk of the network can't do this, then the network is going to fall apart; due to *a lack of network-wide upstream capacity*, part of the network will still be downloading blocks many minutes after a block has been published. This increase in block broadcast latency makes it so that the block chain is no longer guaranteed to converge to one particular global chain.
Therefore, 8 MB blocks would require around 15 Mbit/s upstream capacity, which is extraordinary. There are various vague proposals for significantly improving block relay efficiency (IBLT, etc.) which *would* allow the upload/download to be spread across ~5 minutes, but this doesn't exist yet.
You also have to consider that 8 MB blocks would equal 420 GB per year added to the block chain. All existing full node software won't even work without downloading the *entire* block chain, and (arguably) it should always be a goal of full nodes to download and verify the entire history. And while there are some not-yet-solid ideas for distributing block chain storage, *someone* will need to store the block chain.
Another big issue is that even pruned full nodes need to store the UTXO set, but there isn't much relationship between block size and expansion of the UTXO set. A 100 kB block can increase the UTXO set size more than a 1 MB block, for example. Probably there should be an additional limit on UTXO set expansion that works similarly to however the max block size ends up being handled.


That'll happen eventually. No one's advocating staying with 1 MB forever. We're just not ready quite yet. Once certain necessary technology is added to Bitcoin (IMO, flex cap + improved relaying + UTXO set costs + initial sync improvements + distributed chain storage), the max block size should be able to grow proportionally to worldwide consumer upload speed.


Bitcoin was never going to work (directly) with micropayments. Anyone who said so was misinformed.


There's been ongoing debate as to whether it'd be OK for the network to someday completely forget about transactions. That'd mean that new full nodes wouldn't be able to *completely* be sure that they're on the correct Bitcoin network. But if you're talking about a transaction that's buried under 5+ years of blocks, you can be pretty sure that it's valid without needing to actually check it.
In any case, long-term it will not be the case that you need to download the entire block chain to use Bitcoin Core or even function more-or-less as a full node. It's just a question of whether Core should *try* to download the full history in the background once it's up and running.
Full nodes will always need to store the UTXO set, so keeping its size down is very important.


I imagine that he's aware that his words would carry way more weight than they should, and he doesn't want to unduly influence the community. At this point, the Core devs collectively know way more than Satoshi ever did about Bitcoin.
If Satoshi actually does issue a statement:
* You should judge his words based on their technical merit. Satoshi is not God. He didn't create the world's first decentralized money so that we would all be forever bound by his own indomitable will.
* We should all be ashamed that we mismanaged this issue so severely that we needed some "messiah" to save us.


Every full node needs to apply *exactly* the same consensus rules. There's no room for any error whatsoever. English specifications aren't sufficient -- it needs to be in code. Using some sort of declarative language isn't good because then the compiler or interpreter is itself part of the protocol.  Currently the consensus rules are specified in C++ by the reference implementation. In the future, the consensus rules may be specified in some low-level language (maybe something vaguely similar to Bitcoin's own Script), and then this specification will be fed *directly* into a VM that each implementation can design. This separates the specification from the software while preserving the exactness of a reference implementation and allowing implementation-specific optimizations via the VM.

It'd be a hardfork. But as 5tu mentioned, it's running now on a testnet sidechain. Once all of the bugs are worked out, a production-ready sidechain with confidential transactions and other features will probably be created: you'll transfer your bitcoins to the sidechain, do whatever mixing you want, and then move them back out of the sidechain. And if the production sidechain is successful and popular, getting consensus for a hardfork that moves this feature to Bitcoin proper will be easy (this is desirable because Bitcoin is more secure than a sidechain).
CryptoNote doesn't anonymize values. It could implement confidential transactions (maybe even as a sidechain whose parent is a CryptoNote altcoin instead of Bitcoin), and this would complement its existing ring signature stuff. Bitcoin probably won't ever directly implement ring signatures like CryptoNote because it has very poor scalability properties, though both CryptoNote-style ring signatures and confidential values could be done in a sidechain (which could be configured to "reset" every couple of years to alleviate the scalability problems).

If people perceive that the financial system is falling apart, then I'd expect people to treat BTC as a safe haven, and the BTC price might rise. But if people perceive it as a more typical, temporary recession, then I'd expect many of the people who had been in BTC to seek out higher yield or hedge against market downturns to move back more into traditional investments, in which case the BTC price might fall.

The sender of a transaction has to send the transaction with a scriptPubKey of OP_TRUE for the recipient to use SegWit. This is what you're mainly objecting to, I guess, because old nodes will see this as an anyone-can-spend output. If you don't send a transaction with an OP_TRUE output, then the recipient can't use SegWit. The transaction can't be modified on the wire to add support for it.
New nodes could separate the scriptSig from all transactions for transmission amongst themselves, but I don't know whether this is actually planned (not sure if there's any advantage), and they wouldn't do it when talking with old nodes. Main-blocks would still need to contain the full scriptSig or else old nodes would reject it and it wouldn't be a softfork.

I know for a fact that everyone or nearly everyone who ACKed the pull request for this statement before it was published understands the roadmap to mean no hardforks for now. I think that this is pretty clear from the roadmap, especially this paragraph:


I interpret this to mean no hardforks until after SegWit and probably some more technology unless an emergency makes it absolutely necessary. It's possible that if development goes really quickly all of the prerequisite technology can be finished in less than a year, but this doesn't seem likely to me.

The additional Script changes aren't coded yet, but last I heard they sound very likely to happen.
Since SegWit moves Script verification elsewhere, it's easy to make any changes right away. Script could be completely redone, in fact, though that's not planned. Additional changes can also be done fairly easily in future softforks, but if there are some uncontroversial and not-very-complicated changes possible right now, they might as well be included along with SegWit. Any changes requiring much debate will probably not be included along with SegWit for the sake of expediency.

Exactly how softforks can be done cleanly is complicated. Even if it's a softfork, *immediately* making the change in the code will result in a fork. You need a coordinated roll-out, preferably with majority miner support.
The way that softforks work is *OK*, but probably less than ideal. Miners are too involved, there's too much potential for messiness, and in some cases there's the potential for not enough messiness. It's not as if Satoshi sat down and thought, "philosophically, what would be the best way to make changes?" The softfork behavior just emerges from how the system works, and nobody knows how to do better on a technical level.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:44:55


True. But that has nothing to do with miners. A change of that sort has no relation to what miners decide to do.


Maybe double-spending would be more likely for a few days. I don't think it'd be a big deal.


I don't really know what you're talking about. The algo change would be a hardfork, which miners have no influence over. The hardfork could possibly fail economically, but I doubt that it would.


No, I was speaking in general. By "you" I meant "you miners, any who might be reading".


Yeah, that's why miners have no control over it.


Once miners are ready, the softfork can continue smoothly. The point of these thresholds are to *indicate* when this has occurred, not to impart miners with any decision-making ability.
The way these rollouts work is that Bitcoin Core gets a new rule saying, "after 95% of mining power agrees, this rule is a hard rule and any blocks violating it will be rejected absolutely, forever". Then this new client is spread widely, the vast majority of full nodes adopt it, and then miners slowly reach that threshhold. Now think about what happens if 95% of miners agree, but then 75% of miners start violating the rule again. (Something similar happened in BIP 66.) The vast majority of full nodes will be hard-enforcing this rule, and will never accept blocks produced by these miners no matter what. Do you think that miners will continue mining on the wrong chain, producing coins that the vast majority of full nodes won't accept? (They didn't in the BIP 66 incident.) If they continue, do you think that they have much chance of winning economically against the vast majority of full nodes + competing miners who have every incentive to supplant these misbehaving miners?
It's been known since the start that you don't need miners to agree to this sort of change. You can just insert a time limit ("after such-and-such exact date and time, this rule is a hard rule and any blocks violating it will be rejected absolutely, forever") and forego the miners entirely. Miners will catch up or be left behind. This is how Satoshi always did softfork changes (which he did a lot of). The disadvantage is that it's slower and there might be some turbulence at the flag day, so nowadays the miner-trigered approach is preferred, but it's not required.


Right. But currently, in practice, Core = Bitcoin, so that's why I said "Bitcoin Core".
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:05:22
I don't see any reason for that to be the case. There's no cost to approaching the limit. Rational miners will completely fill up blocks with all available fee-paying transactions.

It could be done via LN, but:
* LN is not usable enough yet for it to be worthwhile right now IMO.
* The bitcointalk.org payments system is currently based on a *balances model*. In other words, when you pay to the given address, a balance associated with your account is updated, and then the system checks/debits your balance when you pay for something. This makes a lot of sense when using Bitcoin addresses for payments without any intermediary, as bitcointalk.org has always done. However, LN does not work naturally like this, and instead expects the *invoice model*, where users are sent to an invoice page for every logical payment, and they need to take further steps there (think BTCPay/BitPay). To move to the invoices model in order to be compatible with LN, I'd have to completely rewrite the payments system, which I may do eventually, but I'm not very eager to do it. (I recently wrote more about bitcointalk.org's payment processing [here]( if you're interested.)
The addresses are SegWit addresses, BTW, so spending these tiny amounts is more space-efficient.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:49:54
It sounds like you shouldn't be using Quickbooks...
bitcointalk.org has always accepted only BTC, never with any intermediary, and while taxes are very time-consuming because you have to account for *every* transaction, and I really doubt that even 5% of US Bitcoin users are actually doing taxes completely/correctly because of the time and complexity involved, I wouldn't call it "damn near impossible". I just use a spreadsheet with a few fairly complex formulas and a sheet of [daily price averages]( plus a little program I wrote to do the cost-basis calculations via copy/paste from/to the spreadsheet.
On changing the tax laws, IMO:
* Taxation is theft, and should ideally be eliminated.
* If that is impossible, it'd be better to replace income tax with just a federal sales tax, property tax, a tax directly on state governments, or pretty much anything other than income tax.
* If income tax can't be eliminated, I don't think that the often-talked-about idea of classifying Bitcoin as a foreign currency would help much, and may hurt. If you do many transactions, you'd probably still go over the yearly limit and have to do all of these calculations as before, and there is no reduced long-term capital gains rate on foreign currency.
* The current property-like treatment seems to be the only thing which makes sense in the overall US income-tax framework. I've sometimes thought that replacing the property treatment with a use tax (ie. you'd pay a *fixed* percentage, lower than the normal tax rate, regardless of cost basis, every time you buy something with BTC or sell BTC) might make some sense because it'd make calculation way easier, but it'd often result in either far higher or far lower tax paid compared to the property treatment, so it probably won't happen, and if it did then not everyone would be happy.

That's basically what happened with the ETH/DAO situation. ETC, the original cryptocurrency, still exists, though they are marginalized because the ETH community is highly centralized and doesn't on the whole care about this sort of thing. The Bitcoin community is much more ideological and decentralized, so it'd be a lot more difficult to steal the Bitcoin name, even if there was a DAO-scale loss of funds encouraging it.
It's not impossible IMO that some "corpo-Bitcoin" with tons of backing could *for a while* beat Bitcoin in price and/or other metrics. But since it would abandon most of the features which distinguish Bitcoin from eg. PayPal, it wouldn't deprive Bitcoin of its (ever-growing) market niche in the long-term. Above all, it'd be important not to *surrender* to this sort of thing, but to keep Bitcoin working, stable, and with its important characteristics intact.

OKex, as with many exchanges, functions based on *leverage*, which means that most of the money on the exchange is imaginary, not backed by any underlying asset such as real BTC. Normally this works fine, but in this case a weird market condition caused the imaginary money to lose the intended relationship with real, withdrawable money. It's similar to someone depositing BTC to a traditional exchange, trading around with it, and then double-spending their original BTC deposit so that the exchange now has less real BTC despite allowing a bunch of trades with the deposited BTC already. So people who thought that they'd made money recently on OKex will probably have a large amount of that profit taken away in order to make the system-wide imaginary balances line up with the real balances again: in total, about 940 previously-believed-real BTC will be eliminated.
This sort of event can't be completely prevented on an anonymous leveraged exchange, though such massive losses indicates problems with their risk management.
I suspect that it will not have a massive effect on the wider market, but I'm not sure.

Yeah, I don't think that automatic fee calculation will work. It'll always be possible to manipulate the calculation.
IMO, the long-term solution is to allow transactions to be cancelled and resent with higher fees. If you send a transaction that isn't confirming because the fee is too low, you just send it again and remember to pay more next time. This feature doesn't require changing the protocol, but it's somewhat difficult to safely add it to Bitcoin-Qt, so it probably won't happen soon.
I'm pretty sure that 0.9 won't include any drastic changes in fee behavior.

It needs to be large enough that network latency is in comparison *completely insignificant* for all miners. Otherwise mining will only be possible in certain regions, or possibly the block chain will be constantly forking/merging, never converging to a single global chain. So 10 minutes is very safe and 2 minutes is probably fine, but anything under a minute is dangerous.
For example, Bitcoin's 10-minute interval is too low if you want to allow mining on both Earth and Mars. Due to latency, blocks produced by miners on whichever planet has less mining power would usually end up rejected as "stales". And if both planets were nearly equal in mining power, you'd see a lot of very long spontaneous chain forks. Similarly, block times of under a minute might centralize mining to whichever region on Earth has the most mining power, and you'd very often see issues due to long forks.
Shorter block times also make certain attacks against the network easier because they increase stale blocks for the legitimate network, but attackers are working on their own chain offline, so they don't have any stales. So shorter block times decrease the network's effective mining power against attackers.
Even if there's an average of 1 minute between blocks, it wouldn't be particularly rare for blocks to take 5+ minutes. There aren't very many situations where you can wait 5 minutes and not 50 minutes (this wouldn't be acceptable for point-of-sale applications, for example). Due to this and the above issues, it wouldn't be very useful IMO to reduce the Bitcoin block interval.

4.8.3 isn't a valid Bitcoin-Qt version. Do you mean 0.8.3?
If you're using Bitcoin-Qt as a wallet, then it's usually OK to use old versions, though 0.8.3 has a serious bug which allows any of your peers to crash your client. You should either update or ensure that your client only connects to trusted peers.
If using Bitcoin-Qt as a wallet, it's fine to just use one version until you start to have problems. Newer versions will typically be faster and less buggy, and transactions sent from them may have lower fees or confirm faster, but if you're OK with the old version, then you don't usually *need* to upgrade. I especially recommend waiting a few months to upgrade to a new major version (like from 0.9 to the not-yet-released 0.10) -- major updates are more likely to contain bugs.
If you're a pool op, solo miner, or running Bitcoin Core just to help the network, then you should use the the latest stable release at all times unless you know what you're doing. (It's good to have a diversity of versions on the network, but some versions introduce changes that all miners and most full nodes need to use.)
In the unlikely event that your Bitcoin-Qt wallet becomes *unsafe* to use, you will receive an alert about this in the bottom of the Bitcoin-Qt window.
To upgrade, shut down Bitcoin-Qt, backup your wallet just to be sure, and then run the new installer. You don't need to uninstall the old version or do anything special to upgrade.

I consider a hard fork to be non-contentious if it is supported by the vast majority of Bitcoin experts, users, and companies (ie. none of those groups contain any serious opposition). This isn't going to happen in the short term for any max block size increase, but this will change as there's more debate and research, and as block space actually becomes more scarce. If transactions actually become massively slow or expensive, a more conservative increase to ~2 MB would be easy to get consensus for. And other hard forks might be easier than the max block size increase if any are necessary (I don't know of any big proposals).
"Non-contentious" is subjective. We'll all have to individually decide whether a fork is contentious or not. But I think it's pretty clear that there is very significant contention surrounding all max block size proposals.

This. If someone arranges it so that two people on opposite sides of the globe send two conflicting transactions at exactly the same time, it really is impossible for network participants to know which one came objectively first, but "consensus" means that the network needs to have some single final answer. Bitcoin's solution is weak in that the network can spend time (theoretically even years) split in two or more pieces, and when it finally does merge into one network again, the final answer might not be correct by *any* criteria. I don't know gmaxwell's exact proof, but it probably requires that the solution be stronger than this.
The idea of the block chain was not obvious even to experts pre-Bitcoin, no matter how obvious it seems now.

I mentioned this in my [don't invest recklessly]( post from 8 months ago:


Obviously this can't be a hard-and-fast rule, and past behavior does not guarantee future behavior, but if you buy a wide basket of altcoins, then historically this has tended to act similarly to a leveraged BTC position but with varying/unknown leverage. In other words, when BTC rises, altcoins-in-general tend to rise faster, and when BTC drops, altcoins-in-general tend to drop faster. (This also largely explains the inverse correlation between BTC price and BTC dominance.)
If you're worried about diversification, then the first thing you should probably worry about is diversification on a higher level. Things like cash (no Tether!!!), precious metals, real estate, stocks, and bonds are going to be much less correlated with BTC than any typical altcoin.

Yeah, Satoshi originally planned for people to do all economic activity through the Bitcoin client. Due to this, the client didn't get any sort of command-line version for a very long time, and 0.1.x was Windows-only.
The client was supposed to support auctions, reputation, etc. But Satoshi didn't have a very good design for any of this. For example, his solution for preventing spam and ensuring that scammers couldn't immediately create new accounts was apparently for every user to solve some Bitcoin blocks, which today sounds totally nonsensical -- *no one* mines blocks solo anymore. I think that he realized the design issues, abandoned all of this, and added the RPC interface so that websites could do this stuff instead.

If the max block size is not high enough, then there will be more competition among transactions for space in blocks, and transaction fees will need to increase. If fees are too high, then no one will want to use Bitcoin for transactions directly. In this case, transaction would usually be done by sending money through semi-centralized intermediaries. For example, if I had an account at BitStamp and I wanted to send money to someone using Coinbase, then BitStamp and Coinbase would just make edits to their databases and settle up later. This is pretty similar to how the current banking system works, though Bitcoin could provide some additional transparency and security. This model is probably how microtransactions will work with Bitcoin someday, but it's desirable for larger transactions to be reasonably cheap on the real Bitcoin network.
If the average block size goes up too much, then only people with very high bandwidth will be able to run full nodes. This is extremely dangerous because if there is ever a hardfork, only full nodes are able to "vote". (This is a simplification. Bitcoin is not a democracy. The dynamics of how such a situation would play out are very complex.) It is absolutely essential for Bitcoin's survival that the majority of Bitcoin's *economic power* be held by people who are running full nodes. Otherwise, the few people who actually have influence over the network will be able to change the rules of Bitcoin, and no one will be able to stop them.
The average block size needs to be somewhere between those two extremes or else Bitcoin will become centralized. Thankfully, while the exact limits aren't known, the reasonable range of average block sizes is probably pretty large. Today, block sizes between 200 KB and 10 MB would probably be survivable. With all of the changes listed by Gavin in this article, 50-100 MB would be possible, and this could increase as worldwide bandwidth capacities increase. In my opinion it's always better to err on the side of smaller sizes, though, since too-large blocks are more dangerous than too-small blocks.
By the way: When people first hear about this, their first instinct is often to propose that Bitcoin should automatically adjust the max block size in the same way that it adjusts difficulty. Unfortunately, this is probably not possible. The appropriate max block size has to do with how much data the network *can safely support*. Determining this requires outside knowledge like worldwide bandwidth costs and the relative costliness of current Bitcoin fees. An algorithm can't figure this out. Once the major problems with Bitcoin's scalability are fixed, I think that the max block size will need to be manually increased every ~2 years to reflect changes in the world.

Bitcoin probably doesn't need to use forwarding like that. Today, when a full node wants to join the network, it broadcasts an `addr` message containing its IP and some other info, and this message propagates to a big chunk of the network. Nodes who receive the message add that node's IP/info to their addr database and will maybe try to connect to it in the future to see if it actually works. By this mechanism, full nodes that have been on the network for a long time know the IPs of most other nodes.
When people are storing random ranges of blocks, the *addr* message will probably just be modified to include a block range field. Then every node's addr database will contain a list of IPs and the blocks that they claim to have, and if you want a particular block you'll just look in the database and try IPs that claim to have that range until you find one that actually does.

Transactions don't have timestamps, and it's possible for the network to have different ideas about which transaction came first. Nodes use the first transaction that they see. Any double-spending transactions are thrown away. But if someone sends two conflicting transactions in quick succession (and to a different set of nodes), the network can be split about which transaction was "first". You won't know for sure which transaction will survive until one makes it into a block and a few blocks are built on top of it.
There some non-standard transactions that network nodes will reject unless they are in a block, which can be used to make double-spending easier. The attacker sends a non-standard transaction *directly* to the recipient node. The software will show this transaction to the user because it affects them, but nearly all other nodes will reject this transaction. It won't propagate to even 1% of all nodes. Then the attacker sends a standard, double-spending transaction to some other nodes. This transaction will propagate properly and will almost certainly get into a block first.
0-conf transactions are *very* unsafe. No one should rely on them unless:
* You have some way of taking back the thing that you sent to the buyer. (A subscription service, for example.)
* You can track down the buyer and pursue legal action if he double-spends.
* You are monitoring the network extremely closely to make sure that no double-spends occur.

* Before I started this project, people complained constantly about the money just sitting around. Now people are complaining that I'm spending too much!? Make up your mind.
* You don't have any right to influence how I spend forum money. I am not a politician, and you are not my constituency. If you didn't donate (pretty much everyone reading), then this issue is totally unrelated to you. If you did donate and you're disappointed at the way I'm spending money, then I'm sorry to hear that, and I will carefully listen to any suggestions you have, but the donation page has always said that donated money is managed by me. It is my responsibility to determine how to spend forum money. Moreover, I believe that the donators who oppose this project are the minority.
* Any accusations that I'm "stealing" forum money is nonsensical. The money has always been transparently visible via the block chain. I'm clearly not using it except in the stated amounts. There is some room to question whether I get some sort of kickback from Slickage (I do not), and it's totally reasonable to argue against the wisdom of spending the money *in this way*. But I almost never see reasonable criticism -- I see insults and nonsensical accusations
* Most forum money is from ads, not donations. The money from donations was typically worth far less when it was donated than it is now.

Only full nodes behave that way, though. Some lightweight clients (eg. MultiBit) will, in some cases, automatically switch to the fork with the most mining power. Other lightweight clients trust some centralized entity to choose for them.

It's irrelevant how much the miners are paying. If banks paid the Federal Reserve $100 in gold for each $100 printed, the result would be that the Fed would become richer, the bank would more-or-less break even, and all other USD holders would have their USD lose value. It's the same with Bitcoin, except that no individual is getting paid by miners.
Satoshi called the mining reward the *subsidy*. Who's subsidizing miners? Everyone holding BTC.
It is a fact that Bitcoin is in a state of high monetary inflation. Pretending that this is not the case is counterproductive. Whether or not we're experiencing price inflation depends on a lot of factors, though I suspect that the drop from $700 to the current price was caused in part by increased supply.

These partial blocks are much smaller than full blocks, though. Probably 100-200 bytes per signer/miner, and fewer signers is more likely than more.


More nodes won't increase the traffic per node. The production of empty blocks by miners will be kept fairly stable by difficulty, and each empty block will produce at most N(~=3) broadcasts by voters. The number of nodes doesn't affect it much. (But more BTC actively used for voting = *less* wasted bandwidth due to failed blocks.)

The current DNS bootstrapping method is probably nearly optimal. Unless you're going to try connecting to IP addresses totally at random, a centralized source is needed for bootstrapping. For full nodes, DNS seeds are only used exactly one time. And you get peers from *all* DNS seeds, so all of them would have to be evil to completely mess up your node.
The situation is less good for lightweight nodes. BitcoinJ-based clients contact the DNS seeds whenever they run, and they *only* connect to Bitcoin nodes provided by the DNS seeds.

There's no problem with using floating-point numbers to *store* money values if you're careful to properly round the floating-point numbers when converting to or from the floating-point format. It's doing *math* with floats that's likely to cause errors.
If you use bitcoind, then you're using doubles to store BTC values. All BTC values given to bitcoind's JSON-RPC interface are interpreted first as doubles, then later converted to the native integer representation using proper rounding. This is totally safe.

There's no reason that OP_TURINGEVAL scripts wouldn't be able to access state data. There are drawbacks to this (which also apply to Ethereum), but it can be done. New Script ops can do pretty much anything and still be added without a hardfork.

That can be added just as easily as P2SH was added. It's not a hardfork. All you do is replace OP_NOP1 (or whatever) with OP_TURINGEVAL, which would pop a stack item and evaluate it in some turing-complete scripting language. 
Turing-completeness was actually introduced *accidentally* by the OP_EVAL proposal which was almost added to Bitcoin before P2SH. When this was discovered, OP_EVAL was replaced with P2SH because the Bitcoin developers *don't want* turing-completeness unless it can be demonstrated that it's useful and worthwhile.

There is no central server. SPV is decentralized. SPV nodes exist on the Bitcoin network just like full nodes, but they store much less data, so they can be tricked more easily (in various ways). If you can get a SPV node to connect to only nodes controlled by you, then it's especially easy to trick it. You could, for example, trick it into thinking that it received a transaction when it actually didn't, with similar implications as a double-spending attack. You can get SPV nodes to connect only to you by putting 100000+ nodes onto the network -- SPV nodes are then very likely to connect only to you.
Pretty much all SPV nodes currently avoid being "surrounded" in this way by trusting that the centralized DNS seeds are giving them good peers. This is centralized and terrible. Mike proposes instead having SPV nodes acquire peers in the normal decentralized way, but with the requirement that some of the nodes that they connect to present anonymous proof that they own a valid passport. This is meant as a sort of proof of work. It's probably difficult for a non-government attacker to obtain many valid passports, so they won't be able to create tens of thousands of evil network nodes. It's a decent solution, and better than relying on DNS seeds, though I don't like it because it's still centralized.

Two results (both will happen):
* Full nodes that are badly behind the average won't be able to be full nodes anymore because they'll be badly out-of-sync with everyone else.
* The network will tend to split for long periods of time because different sections of the network will see different parts or forks of the block chain as being current. Moreover, Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to converge to one global chain at all if the latency of moving blocks between any two points on the network is not insignificant compared to the 10-minute block interval.
I'm not sure that these effects are likely to occur enough to be disastrous given worst-case IBLT performance, but it seems possible to me. More research is needed.

Yeah, that's one of the most interesting of Satoshi's decisions. In 2009, Bitcoin's curve secp256k1 was used pretty much nowhere. It wasn't supported by any crypto library except OpenSSL at the time (AFAIK), and Hal Finney and others questioned Satoshi's decision to use this weird curve. Then in 2013 it comes out that all of the most commonly-used curves are weak or using extremely suspicious constants. Nowadays, secp256k1 looks like one of the most secure EC curves out there because it's old, battle-tested in Bitcoin, and not affected by the suspected backdoors in the NIST curves. I usually tend to think that Satoshi was just an ordinary guy, but this makes me think that maybe he could have had insider knowledge about secp256k1's relative strength compared to the standard curves.

Sidechains will be implemented by applying additional restrictions on transactions that spend outputs with a Script opcode such as OP_NOP1. Current nodes will treat this opcode as a no-op, but upgraded miners will refuse to mine transactions/blocks that don't follow the new rules associated with OP_NOP1. In this way, as long as most mining power is using the new rules, the chain is guaranteed to converge to a state containing no transactions breaking the new rules.
AFAICT, the only reasonable way to prevent sidechain transactions after a softfork is by refusing to accept blocks that contain any transactions that spend OP_NOP1 outputs (or whichever NOP opcode ends up being used) or by only allowing certain whitelisted transaction types. But if you reject such a block, then you will end up on a different chain than the one chosen by both old nodes (before your change) and nodes that accept the new rules. You will be unable to transact with these people. I guess you could argue that this is not by definition a hardfork (though I'd disagree), but it's bad news for you in any case unless you can somehow convince 99% of Bitcoin users to accept your hardfork (or hardfork-like) change prohibiting the sidechain transactions.
tl;dr: Fighting sidechains would be very difficult if they are supported by the majority of mining power. This is just a limitation of the way Bitcoin works.

I don't think that advertising is a very effective use of money. 40% of Americans have already heard about Bitcoin. To convince them to actually use it, Bitcoin must be made more useful. Having a really good community is part of that, and that's what I focus on. If it's easier and more fun to talk about and trade with Bitcoin than fiat, then Bitcoin will gain ground.
Another important area is Bitcoin software development, especially in these areas:
* Sidechains.
* Adding decentralized DNS either directly on top of Bitcoin or as a sidechain. People should be able to directly buy domains using BTC. (I have a design for this in mind, but I haven't had time to try implementing it.)
* Scalability and decentralization.
* Anonymity.
* Reduced fees via secure and easy off-chain transactions.

That makes it far easier to find you, then. The attacker can constantly scan the list of I2P nodes (which is public) and keep track of when nodes are down at the same time as your eepsite. This is called an intersection attack. (I2P actually has a mode where you *do not* run as a normal network node for just this reason, though a powerful attacker will still be able to figure out that you're using I2P by running many I2P nodes and seeing who they connect to.)
I2P is technologically very similar to Tor. Any attack against Tor is likely to also work against I2P.
Unfortunately, I don't believe that any anonymity network in existence today is secure enough to completely rely on for anonymity. You should use the anonymity network, but assume that it will fail completely and plan accordingly.

I was thinking of this sort of attack: An attacker sets up 10,000 nodes which act just like regular I2P nodes in every way except that they secretly log all traffic. I think that eventually, just this will be enough to fill most I2P users' node databases with a lot of attacker nodes. It's then likely that I2P users will form tunnels where both the first and last hop are attacker nodes, which allows for easy timing attacks to deanonymize the user.
I can think of a few ways to make this more difficult. Maybe I2P already has such measures. Though I'm never too confident in automatic methods to determine whether anonymous IPs are trustworthy or not.

It's definitely not "theoretically impossible". &gt;50% of the mining power is certain to be able to achieve it eventually. It's entirely possible that if there's no way for the network to stop it, then miners will get together and agree to create 100 BTC per block (or maybe just not halve the reward next time). If their propaganda is good, maybe they'd get away with hijacking Bitcoin in this way before they are once again prevented from doing so technologically.
Running any sort of lightweight node is only reasonably secure because a large majority of the economy is running full nodes. Miners have a huge disincentive to break the rules because their blocks will be rejected by most of the economy and they'll end up losing money. But if most of the economy was running lightweight nodes and therefore not able to enforce all of the rules, then miners would have every incentive to break them.

Using it might be appropriate for what you're doing. You'll have to weigh the risks with the benefits.
Bitcoin Core has been heavily used and examined for 4 years. Alt clients have not. They are therefore far more likely to have serious bugs which could result in monetary losses. Also, the Bitcoin protocol is not well-defined. If an alt client validates transactions differently than Bitcoin Core, even if this behavior is undocumented, then the alt client is *wrong*. Bugs of this sort can also cause losses in some cases, and it weakens the network somewhat to have people using clients with wrong behavior. btcd was especially full of this kind of bug when it was first released, though maybe they've been careful to find and remove these bugs by now.

Bitcoin-based authentication doesn't touch the block chain. You just sign stuff with your Bitcoin address.
X.509 is terrible security-wise due to the CA architecture. Any CA can sign certs that can replace certs signed by any CA. For example, someone once successfully executed a man-in-the-middle attack against bitcointalk.org by hijacking the DNS and transferring it to Cloudflare. Cloudflare has an agreement with a CA which allows them to issue certs for anyone freely, so the attacker was immediately able to gain a properly-signed bitcointalk.org certificate. (All commonly-used CAs have terrible verification policies, so the attacker in this case probably could have also used his DNS access to "prove" that he owned bitcointalk.org, but he chose to use Cloudflare instead.)

If the BTC price is $1000, then miners are creating $3,600,000 per day. If the price is $400, then miners create $1,440,000 per day.

No. The correct Bitcoin block chain is the one with the most work *and* only valid transactions. You can only know for sure if a chain has all-valid transactions by downloading each one.

Another annoying thing is that Coinbase doesn't have an EV HTTPS certificate, so I always feel the need to triple-check that I'm not being phished when I receive a Coinbase invoice. (First I click the email link, then I carefully verify the URL's domain name, then I type "coinbase.com" in a separate tab and find the invoice URL there and compare it to the email URL.)
Also, I suspect that it would be possible to impersonate someone in a Coinbase invoice. If you know that someone receives an invoice from "theymos" for $1000 on the first of the month every month, send them an invoice a day early from "theyrnos" or something.

And my point is that mining without running a full node provides equal or less "decentralization benefit" than regular pool mining. If you trust someone to verify transactions, then you're *giving them* your mining power, regardless of how you mine. P2Pool doesn't magically convert centralized mining power into decentralized mining power. If 25% of P2Pool mining power collaborates to do something evil, then the mining power of 25% of P2Pool will do something evil. Mining on a pool that mines on P2Pool is the same as if they didn't mine on P2Pool centralization-wise.

If you actually look at the transactions, you'll see that they mostly send money back to 1M4y, or to addresses that very quickly send money back to 1M4y.
The other addresses that I control are only temporary. Every advertiser and donator gets a unique address, for example. Every month, I send all forum income to the forum's 17RTT... address. More rarely, I make the 1M4y address balance accurate by adding or removing funds.
The total BTC received by 17RTT is the forum's actual total income (from both ads and donations) over all time. The current balance of 1M4y is, within a couple hundred BTC, the accurate total amount of money I hold for the forum. Other numbers (such as the balance of 17RTT or the total received BTC of 1M4y) are not likely to be useful.

For encrypted wallets (like Bitcoin Core) and Bitcoin web accounts, you can use the standard password recommendations. Use a unique, random password/passphrase. 6 random words or 12 random characters (with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) is good, and perhaps even overkill in some cases. However, if your encrypted wallet ever becomes possibly accessible by an attacker, you should transfer your money to a new wallet just to be safe.
For brainwallets and deterministic wallets, you need to throw all of your knowledge about passwords out the window because *the entire world will be trying to break your password, constantly, forever*. Therefore, you need an **extremely** secure password. The 12-word seeds generated by many wallets contain 128 bits of entropy, which is equal to secp256k1's cryptographic security. As such, it's very unlikely that such a password will ever be broken without also breaking the wallet's random number generator or ECDSA itself.
For brainwallets that allow you to use your own passphrase, the number of words you should use depends on the size of your dictionary. If you use the diceware wordlist (which is larger than the standard Bitcoin wallet wordlist), 10 words gives you the same 128 bits of security. Using as few as 8 diceware words *might* also be OK, though you probably shouldn't risk it. But **under no circumstances should you come up with a passphrase yourself**. It must be generated by a computer, dice, or some other external randomness. Do not take phrases from books. Do not use any kind of pattern or system. Do not try to pick random words from a list yourself. If you do any of these things, then you will almost certainly lose your money because you are much less random than you think you are. You can sometimes do these things for website passphrases, but *not* for brainwallet passphrases.

A lot of people think that Tor is decentralized like Bitcoin, but in fact it's only distributed. There are (IIRC) nine directory authorities that run the entire Tor network. Taking down the majority of them takes down the network. Taking *over* the majority of them allows you to trick all current Tor users into doing things that would deanonymize them.
Unfortunately, anonymity is far from a solved problem currently. Tor is very stable, but only with the help of these centralized servers. Other networks attempt to be decentralized in various ways, but they tend to have very little theoretical basis for their security claims, and I suspect that I2P and especially Freenet have many design flaws that a powerful attacker could exploit. The really nice thing about Tor and Bitcoin are that they have a good theoretical foundation which makes them obviously secure given certain assumptions. This theoretical foundation is part of why these networks receive so much more attention from experts.

The bitcoin.org client has always used change addresses, but it's handled in a way that rarely causes problems for normal users. Change issues usually only occur when you get too close to the protocol (with paper wallets, block chain viewers, etc.) without knowing what you're doing.
Normal people really shouldn't get so close to the protocol. The protocol is very weird and unforgiving. You probably don't understand it well enough to be totally safe. (This very article contains a pretty major technical error.) I've been involved in Bitcoin for 4+ years and I wrote blockexplorer.com, and even I try very hard to avoid getting into situations where I need to think about change. It's an accident waiting to happen.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:03:34
That centralization stuff won't happen. To start with, it's very unlikely that any attack against ECDSA will instantly be quick enough to steal BTC sent from a one-use-only address (without a publicly-known public key). And you're not supposed to use addresses more than once. People who do so are breaking the rules and therefore signing up for more risk. Centralization won't be added to the network to protect these people.
Also, abandoned bitcoins (especially from mining, which usually sends BTC to known public keys) represent perhaps hundreds of thousands of BTC. It is unacceptable to allow this lost BTC to come back into circulation by any means because the price inflation would be very high. A centralized organization certainly can't be entrusted with this task. Such an organization would be able to (effectively) inflate the currency at will -- it'd be Bitcoin's Federal Reserve. In fact, I believe that if it becomes easily possible for someone to make money by "mining" old addresses, the network will be changed to destroy all vulnerable coins rather than allow these coins to re-enter circulation and cause massive price inflation. (Destroying old coins requires only a majority of miners, not a hard fork. And if miners don't have the right incentives, a hard fork can force them.)

The entire P2SH redeem script must fit into one pushdata, and it is *invalid* to push more than 520 bytes. Miners can't accept such transactions.
520 bytes is enough for 15-of-15 multisig, and maybe more with some non-standard tricks. The 3-of-3 limitation is old, and that was just a standardness limitation.
You can also do multisig without P2SH, though this is far less convenient. This is called native multisig. The number of possible public keys is much higher with native multisig -- maybe as high as 20,000 (theoretically -- such a large transaction would likely never get into a block).

The Linux release contains binaries that work on nearly all Linux distributions. One good way of installing would be to create a "bitcoin" user, put all of the files in the release's `bin/32` or `bin/64` directory (as appropriate) into that user's home directory, and then create a startup script or crontab entry that runs `~bitcoin/bitcoind` as the bitcoin user when the system starts up. Bitcoin's files will end up in ~bitcoin/.bitcoin.
If you already have Bitcoin installed, you can just replace the existing binaries (bitcoind, etc.), probably in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, with the ones in the release. However, this is an unstable version, so you should not trust it with a lot of money.

If you run nodes without using them for transactions, then they don't have any say in a hardfork. Resolving a hardfork is all about economics. There isn't any sort of vote among full nodes or anything like that. What's important is whether you will:
* Notice a hardfork and choose the correct fork.
* Boycott services that support the incorrect fork.
Both of those require that you have a full node, but you also must actually use the full node for your Bitcoin transactions. If you run 100 full nodes but use MultiBit for your Bitcoin transactions, then you're going to end up supporting the wrong fork if it gets miner support (until you hear that there's a hardfork and you stop using MultiBit, at least). Your full nodes will stay on the correct fork, but it won't do you or the network any good.

The directories try really hard to prevent evil Tor nodes from existing on the network.

Older versions are still supported, and they still contribute to the network. 0.10 can efficiently download the chain from nodes as old as 0.3.18, for example.

Money sent to an OP_RETURN output is not reclaimed by miners. I've seen this repeated by several people, even in articles. OP_RETURN outputs are provably unspendable, so you typically send them 0 bitcoins, but this is not required. If any bitcoins are sent to an OP_RETURN output, they're lost forever. Miners do not take them as part of the fee. Fees are separate.
Also, the Bitcoin protocol doesn't know anything about addresses. Bitcoins are sent to *scripts*. I could send some bitcoins (or even 0 bitcoins) to the script `OP_TRUE`, and then anyone could spend this output (even it has 0 bitcoins). It doesn't matter that the script can't be interpreted as an address.

The default fee in Bitcoin Core is 0.0001 BTC (currently 0.04 USD) per KB (rounded up). Most transactions are smaller than 1 KB.
You can pay a smaller fee if you want. Usually your transaction will still confirm, but it might take a lot longer. Sometimes transactions with too low of a fee will never confirm, though.
So most people pay 4 cents per transaction currently, but this depends on the exchange rate, the transaction size (in bytes, not BTC), how old the coins you're spending are, what wallet you're using, what fee-related settings you've set, what fees miners are willing to accept, etc. It's pretty complicated, but your wallet should take care of it for you.

My main concern is not that transactions won't get to miners, but that blocks will be too large to get to full nodes. It's important for Bitcoin's security that a big part of the economy be backed by full nodes. At the very least, all Bitcoin business (even small ones) should be running full nodes. But there's a tragedy of the commons here because each person who could run a full node doesn't lose a lot by not running one (there's only a very slightly increased risk of various problems), and miners don't have much reason to keep blocks small to make it reasonably cheap for people to run full nodes. So there will be a tendency for miners to make bigger and bigger blocks, and for people to gradually stop running full nodes when the bigger blocks make it too expensive to do so. Since this is gradual, no one's going to put their foot down and hardfork to enforce a smaller block size.
The market *might* find a solution to this problem if the max block size was completely removed. For example, maybe a decent chunk of miners would discourage blocks that they think are too big (even though this would certainly be bad for them on the short-term), or users would send transactions directly to miners that they believe are acting reasonably, or concerned Bitcoiners would directly subsidize miners that are acting reasonably. But I still think that the average block size is likely to at least *gradually* increase faster than average worldwide bandwidth because miners have such a strong incentive to make this happen.

Miners are mostly irrelevant in a hardfork. In a hardfork, the network splits in two. *Everyone* who runs a full node must choose which side of the fork to use by upgrading or not. Once you're on one side of the fork, it doesn't matter whether 99% of miners are on the other side: you'll only listen to miners on your fork.
In practice, this means that essentially all big Bitcoin companies plus a large majority of individuals must agree to the hardfork for it to proceed smoothly.

Agreed. The market should eventually stabilize at a price where the inflation from mining equals the value added to the Bitcoin economy due to growth. Maybe our current price is that price.

No. I first talked to James Wang (= Slickage) a couple months before paying him.




There was a public request for bids for several years. I received maybe ~20 bids in that time. A couple of these bids were very promising, but the applicants became busy with other things and were unable to do it. The others failed to demonstrate to me that they could do the job. (Maybe a few of them could have done it, but a lot of applicants just contacted me to say that they could do it, but without offering any reason that I should believe them. I am not an interviewer. I'm not going to ask a hundred questions to determine your suitability for the job. You have to sell yourself to me if you want me to hire you.)
Slickage was recommended by Warren Togami, who has himself done important technical work for the forum. I trust him. After talking to James, I was satisfied that Slickage would be able to do the job. There are many software development firms. I probably could have found one that's cheaper and better. But I don't have time to research this (I'm a full-time college student), I don't really know how to determine whether one firm is better than another anyway, and few trustworthy people were willing and/or able to help me find one. So I picked the first firm I found that was capable of doing the job (after several years of looking).


They've never created forum software, but the team members all have a lot of experience with creating user-driven websites. Slickage itself is fairly new. I view hiring them as just indirectly hiring several skilled programmers. (I work directly with all of the programmers who are building the forum software.)


The thing is, I write these detailed posts every now and then, but no one reads them and I still get asked the same things all the time. Everything in this response has already been answered elsewhere.

You can't test a transaction for a repeated R value in isolation. You need to compare it against every transaction on the block chain. This is expensive, which is why wallets don't do it. Checking your transactions for repeated R values is very similar to checking whether an address you generate has ever been generated before. Both are expensive checks which should be pointless if the wallet is operating even remotely correctly.


That's been done since the first version of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:16:50
No. Some miners might accept them if you send the transaction directly to them and include a large fee, though.

There is demand, and demand is growing, but it won't grow quickly enough to significantly outpace Bitcoin's rather massive monetary inflation until after the next reward halving. I wouldn't be too surprised to see the price reach $1000 in the next year or two, but $10,000 is way too high.
(Then again, I was very surprised when the price went from $0.003 to $1 in about a year, so who knows.)

Full nodes must download the entire block chain. Currently this isn't so bad, but the total download size increases constantly, and it will increase much faster if the max block size is increased (which is likely within the next few years). That's when a UTXO tree is really necessary. It ensures that you can become an "almost-full" node in a small, constant amount of time, and only then slowly work toward becoming a complete full node.

True, but it doesn't really matter whether you believe our "story". Take us at our word or don't. If you think that we're lying for some reason, then that means that the real owners or bitcoin.org are somehow in on it or else they would have corrected us, so it's a pretty pointless argument.
WhoisGuard is safe for bitcoin.org. Namecheap isn't going to screw such a high-profile domain unless they get enormous pressure from the US government, and in that case the .org registry itself could also be targeted.

Sidechains allow you to create something very similar to an altcoin, but with a fixed, guaranteed exchange rate between the sidechain and Bitcoin. So I could automatically convert 1 BTC into 500 ExampleSideChainCoins (SCC), and then at any time in the future convert any 500 SCC back into 1 BTC. This is useful mainly because you can create sidechains that try new technology or make different tradeoffs than Bitcoin without potentially harming the value of the Bitcoin currency if the sidechain becomes popular (because Bitcoiners can buy into the sidechain at *any* time).
The main arguments against sidechains seem to be:
* Sidechains might not work very well because sidechains themselves will have only SPV-level security (worse than Bitcoin), and people who mine sidechains might not have the right incentives. I agree that this may be a problem for some potential sidechains.
* If a sidechain is created that is far better than Bitcoin, then almost all Bitcoin users will move to the sidechain. It is possible to imagine scenarios in which this could possibly be a bad thing (like the GovernmentCoin example in the OP). Also, a migration of people away from the Bitcoin block chain could maybe cause economic problems with the Bitcoin block chain. I don't see this as a major concern because if a sidechain is clearly better than Bitcoin, then everyone *should* move to the sidechain. And I don't think that any sort of "evil sidechain" could ever become popular.
* Sidechain work is being funded by Blockstream, a for-profit company. Some people are paranoid about this, especially since Blockstream is hiring 2 of the core devs. However, sidechains are a very old idea (Satoshi once mentioned something similar), and they have pretty wide support among Bitcoin experts.
The chance that introducing sidechains will *technically* harm Bitcoin is negligible.

Account sales are allowed for the following reasons:
* It can't be prevented. If it was disallowed, people would just sell accounts in secret.
* Purchased accounts are usually used for signature ad campaigns. Sometimes the buyer simply wants the higher prestige associated with an older account. Purchased accounts are very rarely used for scamming; because account selling is openly allowed, everyone knows to view even Legendary members with suspicion, so the account is usually not worth the cost.
* While I find the idea of selling accounts to be distasteful, I suppose it's a good thing for people to be able to get some money for their previous high-quality forum contributions if they no longer value the account. I've had people ask me whether they could sell their accounts because they desperately need the money, and I really don't want to say no to such requests.
Account recoveries are my lowest priority because they involve a ton of investigation, and you shouldn't lose your account in the first place. If my investigation is not thorough, I could end up accidentally "recovering" an account by giving it to a thief. But I don't often have hours of spare time to devote to such things, so I end up doing only a few account recoveries per month, and many requests get ignored. (I choose recent requests that look straightforward. For any forum business, if I ignored your past requests, resend it every couple of weeks and make it more clear/straightforward.)
This case is one that I have looked at previously. It has a [7-page thread]( It's clear that the OP owned the account at one point. But there's a decent chance that the current owner bought the account from the original owner. Since the case is uncertain, I'm erring on the side of inaction for now.
To my knowledge, there has only ever been one account stolen due to a flaw in the forum itself (other than the general authentication architecture promoting bad practices), and that was long ago. Accounts are usually stolen in these ways (in order of decreasing commonality):
* The user set an easy-to-guess "security question". Guesses for these are rate-limited, but this isn't going to help you if you use a stupid question like "What is your best friend's first name?" (On bitcointalk.org, users set their own security questions freely. There are no preset ones.)
* The user's forum password was reused on a site that got hacked.
* The user's email account was compromised.
* Phishing.

Breaking Shared Send might not be possible in all cases, but it's probably possible in many cases. gmaxwell's original description of CoinJoin required that all non-change outputs be of equal value. By not following this rule (for apparently no good reason), blockchain.info makes it possible to connect outputs to inputs in a transaction in at least some cases.


*Any* effectiveness is too much. In proper CoinJoin, it is *impossible* to get any information about input&lt;-&gt;output mappings from the transaction alone.

IMO, the main reason that libertarianism and Austrian economic theory are so closely tied today is that the Mises Institute has been one of the main sources of libertarian ideas/education over the past decade+, and they push both ideas as one package.
Austrian economics is inherently opposed to big government and especially to monetary inflation, so almost all Austrian economists are libertarians of some sort. Not all libertarians follow Austrian economics, though. David Friedman, one of the most famous anarcho-capitalists, is a Chicago-school economist, for example.

Lightweight nodes (eg. bitcoinj) won't be found via `getaddr` because they don't broadcast their IPs to the network.

The total traffic is increased, but it's distributed across all nodes, so the traffic per node doesn't increase (much). Each node only receives a particular piece of data once, and they send it to their peers once (if a peer doesn't have it already). Their number of peers for each node should remain roughly the same with a larger network if the network's structure is OK.

Yeah, that screenshot certainly isn't from the real block chain, though I don't know the details. He might have taken it before the genesis block (depending on his timezone), or it could have been a separate chain with a different genesis block, or he might have worked off of the real genesis block but then not published those blocks after releasing Bitcoin. Generating 213 difficulty-1 blocks in less than a day would have been difficult on 2009 CPUs unless he had many of them, so it's probably more likely to be a chain with a different genesis block and lower difficulty.
It's also interesting to note that (I think) even Bitcoin 0.1 would adjust the way times are displayed depending on your system's locale settings. The format in that screenshot is mainly used in the UK, I think.

Eligius supports decentralized mining via getblocktemplate, which allows you to mine there without trusting that they won't use your mining power for evil.

I think:
* Bitcoin's monetary inflation from mining has been exceeding the inflow of new capital for some time. Bitcoin's inflation rate is very high right now  -- much higher than the USD inflation rate, in fact. This, plus the recent strength of the dollar, is what's been causing the Bitcoin price to drop steadily for the past several months.
* There's always a lot of speculation, which seems to have random (but sometimes large) effects on the price. At some point, these random changes manifested in a large price drop.
* The long-term downward trend from inflation plus the short-term big drop from speculation caused some investors to panic and sell a lot of BTC, which compounded the problem.
I've been seeing some positive signs recently. I think that the price will start to move upward within a few days and eventually stabilize around $500 for a while. I don't expect huge upward price movements (&gt;$750) until about a year from now, when the subsidy halving starts approaching. (I have a pretty bad record with price predictions, though.)

The reason that checkpoints are needed now is that without them, it's too easy for an attacker to send new nodes a long chain of low-difficulty blocks that they pass off as the real block chain. This wastes a ton of the node's time and resources. Checkpoints let the node know pretty quickly that these chains are bad, since they don't match up with the checkpoints.
With headers-first, nodes will first download all of the headers that their peers are offering, figure out which chain is longest, and only *then* download that chain. This will also allow nodes to download blocks in parallel from several peers, which is currently impossible.
Checkpoints are also useful because Bitcoin Core doesn't verify signatures in blocks older than the latest checkpoint. Signature verification is extremely slow, so doing this speeds up the initial sync significantly. With headers first, nodes will probably verify a random sampling of signatures in very old blocks instead.

Depends on your client. Bitcoin Wallet For Android uses SPV mode. With SPV, you trust the majority of mining power, even if they're breaking the rules. Your mobile device would end up on whichever side of the fork has more mining power.
The blockchain.info wallet trusts blockchain.info totally. Your client will believe what they tell you.
Electrum uses what I call hybrid server-assisted mode. In this mode, I believe that the client will warn you if the majority of mining power disagrees with a set of centralized Stratum servers used by Electrum. If the attacker controls the majority of mining power but not the Stratum servers, you will be warned (I think). If the attacker controls the Stratum servers but not the majority of mining power, you will also be warned.
However, all large services like MtGox, Coinbase, etc. are running full nodes. Full nodes follow the rules *no matter what*, even if 100% of miners disagree. So an attacker probably wouldn't have much incentive to try breaking the rules -- all of the important economic actors would ignore him.

phpBB, SMF, etc. are very poorly-written. I don't have a huge problem with PHP *per se*, but most software written in PHP is garbage, and the popular forum software packages are not exceptions.
Some well-written forum software has been produced (Discourse, for example), but all such software is extremely sparse on features when compared to the venerable PHP-based forum software.
My goal is to create well-written forum software that is also as feature-rich as the old PHP software. Since the popular PHP forum software packages each have over a decade of work put into them, this is a very big project worthy of significant expense.
Objectively, it may be better for Bitcoin and the world to spend money on Bitcoin software development rather than this. But since this money came from the forum, I feel that it is appropriate to prioritize this project, which is desired by forum users and good for the forum's future popularity/"profitability". (After this project, most "profit" probably will go to Bitcoin software development and other non-forum projects.) Everyone who uses the forum wants new forum software, no existing forum software is very good, and creating new software will benefit the entire Web, so it's not like I'm spending a million dollars on a golden server or something...

The payment protocol is pretty new (included in Bitcoin Core only since 0.9), so the documentation and support for it is currently not great. It's specified in BIP [70]( [71]( [72]( and [73](

In addition to that weighting method, you can also do it directly in Script using something like:

This will be smaller, but it's less convenient because there's no standard address format for this type of transaction (so you have to write the transaction manually), and this transaction is non-standard so you have to send it directly to a miner like Eligius that will accept it. So the weighting method is probably the way to go unless you're going to be doing thousands of these transactions.

It is indeed 0.5 BTC monthly = 6 BTC yearly. You confused me because you said "3 years until it's gone," but it'd take 83 years for 500 BTC to be depleted at that rate.
In the next month or two I'll be switching to a multisig setup with more treasurers and less money held by me. The fee will also be changed at that point to a consistent 1% yearly.


Holding BTC is very similar. The space requirements are somewhat less, but treasurers use paper wallets or dedicated offline computers which do take up space and require additional physical security. I came up with 1% yearly by looking at gold storage fees. 1% is apparently a low fee for that, so I thought it'd be reasonable for BTC storage.

Gavin's block propagation idea is good, and something like it is necessary for long-term Bitcoin scalability, but it's only part of the solution to the scalability problem. The proposal would remove incentives for miners to keep blocks small, and roughly halve the amount of required network usage for synchronized full nodes. But halving network usage doesn't mean that network usage is a non-issue (especially if you want people to run full nodes at home, which I do), and the proposal doesn't do anything for the serious problem of bringing new full nodes up-to-date in a trustless way. The proposal is entirely unrelated to the 51% problem.

I think that storage is the biggest problem right now. Downloading 20GB is not a *huge* deal most of the time, but it's often very annoying to store 20GB, especially if you want to run several instances of bitcoind.
One possible improvement for initial syncing is to add a hash of the entire UTXO set to all blocks. Then you'd be able to *almost* be a full node by downloading only the last 6 months or so of transaction history. This is safe as long as the last 6 months of mining is not dominated by evil miners, which is probably safe enough. However, these almost-full nodes would probably still download even more transaction history slowly in the background with the goal of eventually getting all of the history and therefore becoming actual full nodes.
The above strategy is especially safe if nodes can create and understand proofs that a chain is invalid. How this works is that if a node notices that a long chain is invalid, it will create cryptographic proof that the chain is invalid and broadcast it on the network. Nodes that receive the proof will be able to verify it without downloading the entire chain, and then they'll stop using the proven-bad chain. This is especially helpful for SPV nodes, but it also helps make almost-full nodes more secure.
These two improvements are the most popular proposals to improve syncing AFAIK, but there are some unsolved problems with them, and they are not unanimously supported by Bitcoin devs/experts. Even so, I think that there's a good chance that they'll be added within the next few years. With both of these improvements, the network could (kind of) do verification in a distributed way.


The block size should not be significantly increased until *after* scalability is solved. As the network is now, 10 MB blocks would be uncomfortable, and 100 MB blocks would probably make Bitcoin very centralized very fast.

That's fine. Unlike BitTorrent or Tor, Bitcoin is usually fairly bandwidth-light unless someone happens to be downloading the full chain from you. What the network tends to be scarce on is unique nodes that accept connections. Every full node uses up 8 connection slots when they make outgoing connections. Some lightweight nodes also use up connection slots. You're providing 26 (34 - 8) connection slots for other people to use. This is your main contribution on a technical level. From an economic perspective, it's also important that you'll notice competing chains that are breaking the rules and boycott services that use these illegal chains. (Lightweight clients can't always determine when a chain is invalid.)

One really cool thing they could do would be to *require* tipping for every comment/submission vote. There was a site called witcoin in 2011 that did that, and it worked pretty well. But this would be such a major change that I doubt they'd actually do it.
Off-topic random thought: Someone should recreate witcoin. How it worked was that upvoting something had a small fixed cost. A large amount of this money would go to the submitter, but some of the money would also go to everyone who upvoted the post previously, with far more money going to people who had upvoted the submission earlier. This encouraged people to patrol new posts and only upvote things that are actually good. A very small percentage of the upvote fee also went to the site, though this was enough to make the site pretty profitable. It was a very fun site IMO. (It was shut down because of unrelated issues experienced by the operator, not due to lack of success/popularity.)

blockchain.info teaches people crazy and wrong ideas about how the block chain works. I recommend avoiding its use if possible.
I've explained this in detail many times before, and probably no one will read this, so I'll be brief. In Bitcoin generally, you're not allowed to assume that sends from an address are "correct" unless the owner of the address tells you otherwise. BTC I control usually gets mixed together; there are only particular addresses under my control where the "balance" will be correct. To see how much money the ad fund has, take the total received amount (linked in the sidebar) and subtract the expenses (listed in the sidebar). You can know that I have this much money by looking at other addresses that I'm known to control.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:12:06
Yes, doing that will convince some miners to include both transactions into their blocks. (Since they can't get the fee unless both transactions are confirmed.) Not all miners do this, though.

People both underestimate and overestimate the power of a "51% attack". The good news is that the damage caused by this attack would be short-term and limited. It would not destroy Bitcoin. In fact, depending on the attacker's luck, a 51% attack can be totally ineffective. The bad news is that, contrary to common belief, you can do pretty much the same thing as a 51% attack with a much smaller percentage of network hashing power. With 5% of the mining power, you can reverse 1-conf transactions 10% of the time. With 30% of the network, you can reverse even 6-conf transactions 15% of the time.
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:01:13
This is an economics problem, not a technical problem.
The problem is that mining is mostly a tragedy of the commons situation, not a true marketplace. If there are even just a few stupid or generous miners who accept transactions at a loss, then miners as a group lose their ability to enforce reasonable pricing. If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security. Fees (and therefore eventually network difficulty=security) end up being a "race to the bottom".
Therefore, I think that it's very likely that ordinary fees will not be sufficient in the future. There are several proposed solutions. One is to keep the max block size small (it's currently 1MB and we'll need to hardfork to increase it). This would limit the supply and force rational miners to only accept the highest-fee transactions, creating something more like a market in mining. But this is potentially harmful for Bitcoin and network security in other ways. Another solution is assurance contracts, which I think will be sufficient, though others disagree. There are also other possibilities.
This topic has been discussed for a very long time: take a look at my [third post on the Bitcoin Forum]( (It is *maybe* the case that I was the first to ask this question.)

Sidechains will have exchange rates with BTC which are defined by fixed algorithms. Usually the exchange rate will be constant. So you'll convert 1 BTC to 1000 ExampleSideChainCoins (SCC), and then whenever you want you'll be able to convert 1000 SCC back to 1 BTC. Alternatively, if the sidechain wants to discourage people from leaving, it could require that you pay 1100 SCC to get 1 BTC back. Or maybe it'll take 1 BTC to get 1000 SCC the first year, then 2 BTC the next year, etc. In any case, the exchange rate will *not* float on the market, but will be a predetermined part of the sidechain.
In the most likely sidechains, there's little risk of BTC holders losing out because they'll be able to buy into the sidechain using their BTC at the same rate that they always could. This isn't the case in that last example I mentioned above, but I don't think that a system like that is likely to become popular.

Yeah, TLS client authentication is probably about as secure as Bitcoin authentication. Though I think that Bitcoin authentication is better because:
* There have been at least two independent flaws found in TLS in the past which allowed a MITM with a valid server cert (from the viewpoint of the client) to impersonate the client. Maybe there are more such flaws. TLS is incredibly complicated.
* TLS client authentication is not well-supported by either servers or clients. Bitcoin authentication is more convenient.
* IMO, most of the commonly-supported public-key crypto algorithms for TLS are worse than Bitcoin's.
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:50:53
That's also not a big problem if you're downloading blocks anyway. Bitcoin Core needs to check every single transaction for validity, and it finds transactions to itself in this way. Looking for these OP_RETURN outputs would add almost no extra processing time to the normal syncing time.
It does make things more difficult for lightweight clients. Clients supporting stealth addresses will need to download and check all blocks since they checked last. This is fairly slow and bandwidth-heavy for lightweight clients. For normal addresses, lightweight clients can use a feature of the Bitcoin protocol called bloom filtering to download mostly only their own transactions, but this doesn't work with stealth addresses. That's why the developers of Dark Wallet advocate a new protocol feature called prefix filtering, which would work with stealth addresses. Currently, I think that Dark Wallet relies on Obelisk servers to index the entire block chain and find relevant stealth address transactions for them, which ruins decentralization and probably anonymity unless you run your own Obelisk server. (Obelisk &lt;-&gt; Dark Wallet anonymity is planned to be improved in the future.)
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:30:10
That's not how confirmations work. Transactions get 1 confirmation when they first appear in a block, and then they get 1 confirmation per block that the network creates. Confirmations have (almost) nothing to do with how many network nodes see your transaction.
Bitcoin transactions take ~10 minutes to become reasonably irreversible. This isn't going to change. Credit cards take 30+ days to reach this level irreversibility, so Bitcoin is still pretty good.
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:41:59

The bigger issue is that it's even *possible* to block these services. If these services used Bitcoin properly (ie, didn't reuse addresses), then blocking them would be *far* more difficult. Though the technology should also be expanded to improve anonymity/uncensorability without hurting convenience. Stealth addresses would help, for example.
@_date: 2014-10-23 06:04:39
You transfer bitcoins into a sidechain and get some number of sidechain tokens for your bitcoins. These tokens work a lot like altcoin currencies except that they can normally be transferred back into bitcoins at an exchange rate determined by the sidechain's rules. If all Bitcoin miners inexplicably quit mining but the sidechain's miners do not, then the sidechain can survive with the coins already transferred into it, though moving coins to/from Bitcoin will no longer work. If Bitcoin simply becomes unpopular, then people will just move their bitcoins to the more popular sidechain. Since the exchange rate between bitcoins and sidechain-coins is (probably) fixed, people who stick with Bitcoin for longer aren't hurt by this unless the sidechain does a softfork to prevent any more incoming bitcoin transfers.
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:11:38
Bitcoin Core (and probably breadwallet) is willing to spend unconfirmed outputs if you created these outputs. Bitcoin Core won't spend unconfirmed outputs from other people because this can cause your transaction to get stuck if the output you're spending never confirms for whatever reason. Bitcoin Core won't even spend outputs with fewer than 6 confirmations unless doing so is required.
A block can contain long chains of previously-unconfirmed transactions, though if transaction B spends outputs from transaction A, then A must be listed before B in the block. This makes efficiently processing blocks a little more complicated for full nodes because they need to modify the UTXO set as they go through a candidate block, and they also need to be able to undo all of these changes if it turns out that the block contains an invalid transaction somewhere in the middle. Whole blocks also sometimes need to be undone when there's a reorg.

Then you've been talking to people who don't know what they're talking about. All businesses that don't want to use a centralized service like BitPay should use Bitcoin Core in their infrastructure somewhere for [security]( and its API, while complicated, has a ton of features which allow for many different ways of dealing with transactions. Probably 99% of businesses can use bitcoind directly as a wallet, and those that can't (like Coinbase) should use bitcoind as a trusted source of network information.

A sidechain for tipping (or just microtransactions in general) is a good idea. The sidechain would be able to attempt some of the various ideas for reducing bandwidth/storage at the cost of reduced security/convenience. For example, the sidechain could automatically destroy unspent outputs over a certain age to reduce the syncing time and storage requirements. Accepting different tradeoffs like this is one of the main reasons for sidechains.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:33:07
Not necessarily. Sidechains work by allowing you to lock bitcoins so that they can only be unlocked if a transaction unlocking them gets a lot of confirmations on a sidechain. How this unlocking works depends entirely on the sidechain, and it doesn't need to be directly tied to the sidechain's currency or even make sense. For example, I think that it'd be possible for you to create a "FedCoin" altcoin/sidechain hybrid where the FedCoin Federal Reserve can print as much FedCoins as they want, but also dictate an exchange rate at which people could convert between BTC and FedCoins. Anyone who did this conversion would get the FedCoins, and then anyone trying to convert FedCoins into BTC would get that person's "invested" BTC. If the system runs out of BTC, then no more FedCoin-&gt;BTC conversions would be possible. Needless to say, this would be insane, no one would use this sidechain, and this is not how sidechains are intended to work.
(I don't know the details of exactly how the sidechain-related extensions to Bitcoin will work, so maybe the above scenario won't actually be quite possible.)
@_date: 2014-07-07 02:16:37
I think that you're right about Bitcoin Core trusting the external IP service (if the answer is somewhat reasonable), but this only prevents incoming connections. Outgoing connections (even to non-seednodes) will work fine. However, the network would likely run out of "connection slots", since everyone who doesn't manually specify an external IP would essentially start rejecting incoming connections. As a result, most nodes won't be able to get the target 8 connections, some won't be able to connect at all, and transactions and blocks might not propagate as well. This situation might also make Sybil attacks easier: the attacker can set up many nodes with properly-set external IPs, and they'll be among the few nodes still accepting incoming connections.

Most sidechains will probably use merged mining, in which case mining on the Bitcoin block chain in addition to the sidechain will be essentially free.

Miners can require extra fees for pegged Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;sidechain transactions and/or atomic swaps if they want. They can choose fees arbitrarily, so they could charge more for certain sidechains, though it may be difficult to detect which sidechain is involved in a given transaction, especially for atomic swaps.
Any sort of hard network-wide fee rule is a bad idea because there's no way for the Bitcoin network to determine how expensive fees really are. There's no way to measure price inflation/deflation in a decentralized way. So the fee could become too high or low, and there'd be no way for the system to correct without a hardfork.

Bitcoin is likely to move to [Lamport signatures]( if QC seems like a threat. This relies on symmetric crypto only, which is widely recognized as being much more secure than the asymmetric crypto always used in public-key algorithms today. It's also very fast and simple. No chance of an NSA backdoor. However, you'll only be able to safely receive money at an address once. This is already recommended practice, and there are planned ways to make this easier, but it still may be a difficult adjustment. Also, signatures are much larger, so each transaction will be about 85 times larger. Signature data is all highly prunable, though, so this will mostly just eat bandwidth, not disk space.

Only 0-confirmation transactions would be able to be cancelled, of course. And without protocol modifications, the recipient would have to agree to the cancellation by not rebroadcasting the transaction. The network forgets about unconfirmed transactions if not reminded every day or so. Currently, both the sender and recipient rebroadcast their unconfirmed transactions every few hours until confirmed so that the network doesn't forget it. If both sender and recipient stop rebroadcasting, the network will forget about the transaction (if it doesn't get in a block), and a new version can be created.
Allowing easy replacement of all 0-conf transactions actually is something advocated by several Bitcoin experts (this proposal/policy is called replace-by-fee), but that's not necessary for some sort of tx cancellation.
Another way to add fees to an existing transaction is to create a new high-fee transaction spending coins in the first low-fee transaction. This might be easier, though I don't like that it generates additional mostly-pointless transactions. The sender just needs to make sure that they're actually receiving coins in every transaction (usually this is the case due to change, but not always). With this, the recipient could also increase fees for an incoming transaction.

Sidechains can be merged-mined, though they don't have to be.
Currently merged mining with Bitcoin does require that Bitcoin be the "parent chain", though I think that you could change this with a Bitcoin softfork so that chains are symmetrical and someone merge-mining Bitcoin and a sidechain could choose to stop mining on Bitcoin. (Satoshi actually mentioned this possibility when he invented merged mining.)

Each node could remember every R value and block transactions that reuse them. But this would be expensive, and the entire Bitcoin ecosystem should not have to suffer increased costs just to prevent idiots from shooting themselves in the foot.
There's no costless solution to this AFAIK. RSA is worse than ECDSA in pretty much every way, especially in the context of Bitcoin. DSA and other varieties of ECDSA like Curve25519 also require a unique and unpredictable *k*. Quantum-safe crypto seems even trickier to implement safely.

With P2Pool, it's like everyone is solo mining, but with low variance. So if everyone mined on P2Pool, you could still do evil things by getting a large percentage of mining power together. P2Pool doesn't magically make it impossible for miners to use their mining power for evil. If P2Pool had 45% of the network's mining power, and you had 45% of P2Pool's mining power, you would have ~20% of the real network. With this much mining power, you'd be able to reverse even 6-conf transactions with decent probability. 51% of either network isn't required to do evil.
(So pools mining via P2Pool are pointless.)

No. They don't have enough data to check which side is correct, so they believe the majority of mining power. If a peer gives them a shorter fork, they'll think that that fork is wrong.
In the future, nodes might broadcast cryptographic proofs that a particular fork is invalid when they see a long invalid fork. Then SPV nodes would be able to blacklist proven-bad forks if they're connected to a good full node or a lightweight node that has heard one of these proofs. But this isn't implemented yet.

Bitcoin Core only broadcasts/remembers a connected node's IP address if that node sends out an *addr* message for itself. An *addr* message containing your own IP means, "I think that I am reachable from the Internet, I don't care about my anonymity, and I want incoming connections."

Nah, there's still a lot of work to do. It needs to copy everything in that huge bootstrap.dat file into the blkxxxx.dat files, verify all of the blocks/transactions, and update the unspent transaction output and block undo databases for each transaction. Transactions before the last checkpoint (295000) don't have their signatures verified, though, which saves a lot of time.
It'd be a lot faster to just copy someone's entire data directory, where all this work is done already, but then you'd be trusting them completely.

5xxx is a Bitcoin-specific way of encoding the private key, which is just a random number in some very large range. When you put this number through the ECDSA key generation algorithm, you get a point (a pair of coordinates) on the elliptic curve. This point is the public key. You can then do some Bitcoin-specific stuff to turn this point into a Bitcoin address.

So what? If everyone moves to a more feature-rich chain without losing any of the value of their saved money (as sidechains allow), then everyone is better off. And if you really don't like the sidechain, then you can stick with the old Bitcoin even if 99% of people do otherwise. Sidechains increase competition and freedom without hurting anyone.


The creators of a sidechain don't become its dictators. If Gavin or Wladimir tried to do something really evil, the community would stop them. The same will be true of sidechains.

CoinJoin works with the existing Bitcoin protocol, so no changes are needed to Bitcoin itself. Clients can implement it right now if they want. blockchain.info's Shared Send feature is an implementation of CoinJoin, for example (but they do some things very wrong, so it is absolutely useless for anonymity).
I think that adding automatic CoinJoin mixing to Bitcoin Core is on the (informal) roadmap, but it probably won't be added for a long time. It is believed that CoinJoin can be done in a decentralized way, but all existing implementations are centralized. Nothing centralized is likely to be added to Bitcoin Core. Integrating CoinJoin into Bitcoin Core in a way that makes sense is also difficult in itself.

I2P's architecture is very similar to Tor. One of the big differences is that I2P has a decentralized replacement for Tor's directory authorities. I just looked into it again, and it's not as bad as I remembered. It's pretty similar to Bitcoin's distributed database of node addresses. But unlike with Tor, where the network will definitely work if the directory authorities are OK, it's not clear under what circumstances the I2P netDB will function correctly. I think that it is probably especially weak to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many evil nodes under his control. Bitcoin is also fairly weak to such attacks, though the block chain makes it very difficult for a Sybil attacker to do more than deny service.

Right. The current setup is just as transparent. If I spend the ad fund money without changing the expense total, then I still owe that money to the Reddit community. If I'm running away with the money and I don't care about that, then the money's gone anyway.
The only extra transparency that the blockchain could provide is to show that I actually do have the money in full reserve, but since I'm holding 5000+ BTC for the forum (provably in that case), it's probably obvious that I have 20 BTC of my own laying around somewhere.
Also, there's been no change in the way the fund is stored. The ad fund has always been in a shared wallet. Originally it was a MyBitcoin wallet (before I took over as mod), then I moved it to the wallet I use for many medium-security things.

Depends on if the type of wallet. SPV wallets like MultiBit will do whatever the majority of mining power says. Centralized/semi-centralized wallets like Electrum will do whatever their trusted servers say to do, I guess. Full nodes like Bitcoin Core will follow their rules no matter what, even if it's the only node left on Earth still using the old rules. But people using different max block sizes won't be able to transact with each other, so the people in the minority will be *incentivized* to switch.
If a split as large as 1/3 happens, that'll be a big failure. These changes are supposed to be rolled out gradually without any interruption in service for anyone. There will probably actually be two years of advance notice, so you'd have to be using a two-year-old Bitcoin client to end up on the wrong fork.
It'll be strange when this change is made, since there will probably be an absolutely huge debate about the issue with much politicking and bad blood, but then the result of the debate will be a change that won't take effect for two years. It'll feel pretty anticlimactic, I think.
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:52:03
It depends on many factors. *Probably* it will be accepted into the next block, but it could take several hours if the network-wide transaction volume is high or if you received the coins recently. If your transaction contains a sub-cent output (change, perhaps), then it might take weeks or longer to confirm.
Bitcoin-Qt accurately calculates fees when sending, taking all factors into account. If you can safely send the transaction for free, Bitcoin-Qt will let you do so.

When a miner solves an empty block, this inherently chooses a set of "voters" randomly. He can't choose a new set of voters without changing his solution. Usually, some of the voters won't be online and the block won't be usable, so miners will have to solve many empty blocks before one of them actually ends up being approved. This isn't a problem, though: the network will just reduce the difficulty to account for this, and complete blocks will still be produced roughly once every 10 minutes. Miners will barely notice the difference.
Checking empty blocks is pretty cheap. The main additional cost will be on the network. Every empty block and partially-verified block will have to be broadcast to everyone, and many of them will end up being worthless. I'm not sure how much of an impact this would have.

If you don't reuse addresses, then it's unlikely that an address will have more than one unspent output. If an address is only spent from once, then it's completely safe from the *R* (aka *k*) reuse issue. The private key is only revealed after the *second* spend from the same address. Though if the address itself was generated with a bad RNG, then an attacker could try double-spending its transactions before they get into a block.
But contrary to everyone's recommendations, blockchain.info strongly encourages address reuse, so this is probably not going to help anyone in this case...

P2SH was added by requiring extra restrictions on certain transactions. Previously, transactions matching the P2SH pattern only had certain restrictions, but after the change, P2SH transactions had many more restrictions. This change was rolled out in this way (IIRC):
1. Bitcoin Core was changed so that miners enforced the additional restrictions on transactions in their own blocks.
2. Such miners also included a string in their blocks to let the developers know that they'd upgraded.
3. Once enough miners had upgraded, miners started hard-rejecting blocks that violated the new rule. Violations of the rule would result in a chain fork, but the fork with the new rule would win because it had previously been determined from step  that this fork was the most powerful.
4. Finally, all full nodes were gradually upgraded to enforce the rules themselves. Blocks that violated the new rule were rejected by everyone immediately.
The change could have been forced by skipping to the last step. Bitcoin Core would have been immediately changed to apply the new rule after a certain point in the future (to give people time to upgrade). After that, any blocks violating the rule or building onto blocks violating the rule would have been rejected, even if 90% of miners were violating the rule. Contrary to common belief, Bitcoin is not a democracy. Every user (if they run a full node) enforces the rules built into their client *no matter what*. This is actually much more decentralized than a democracy of miners, since every user must manually approve any significant change to Bitcoin by upgrading before their node will go along with the change.
Forcing the change in this way would have been more messy because it would have resulted in a hard fork. People using old clients would have had problems, and the network might have become somewhat unstable for a few days. Even so, at the time I advocated doing this hardfork if miners refused to upgrade. Miners should have absolutely no special say in the future of Bitcoin. Miners are employees of the network -- nothing more.

As a transaction processing system, Bitcoin is incredibly expensive. Every full Bitcoin node on the network needs to verify your transaction, and the most powerful computing system in existence needs to work on securing it. Microtransactions will get less and less possible as time goes on, and it's been known that this would happen since Bitcoin's creation. Satoshi's goal in creating Bitcoin was to create a decentralized money, not necessarily a cheap/convenient way of sending money.
But you can use Bitcoin as a *currency* without using it as a payment processor. Think Coinbase-to-Coinbase transactions. Currently these off-chain transaction methods require a lot of trust, but there are known (but not yet implemented) ways of significantly reducing trust and centralization while also increasing anonymity. In the future, you'll use off-chain transactions for things like buying lunch, and you'll use Bitcoin directly for things like buying a car.

*Spent* outputs don't need to be stored after they're buried a few thousand blocks deep, and Bitcoin Core already has logic to discard them. This will actually be done in one of the next few major releases, eliminating 20+ GB of spent transaction data.
Something like your proposal probably will be added to Bitcoin at some point for unspent outputs. All unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) will be hashed into some sort of tree, and the root of the tree will be included in every block. Then you can download just the last 30 days of transactions if you want, and assuming that an evil miner has not been in control of the chain for 30+ days, you'll be able to accurately verify all future blocks using the UTXO tree in the oldest block you downloaded.
However, it is not planned for full nodes to rely entirely on this sort of thing. They'll do it when they first start up so that a long initial sync isn't necessary, but they'll keep downloading historical blocks until they're able to personally verify the entire history. Relying entirely on miners to provide this info would significantly reduce Bitcoin's security. Right now, there is *absolutely no way* for miners to steal money that never belonged to them, create money out of thing air, etc. If everyone relied on something like a UTXO tree, then these things would be possible (even if they're difficult).

I believe that this can only be used to attack Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin-Qt) if your RPC port is publicly-accessible, which is not normal.
Bitcoin Core uses OpenSSL for all of its crypto, but the TLS/SSL parts of OpenSSL affected by this bug are only ever used when Bitcoin's RPC interface is accessed over TLS. RPC TLS is always disabled by default, RPC is disabled by default when running the GUI, and the RPC port is usually not public in any case. So I think that Bitcoin will rarely be directly vulnerable here.

It's interactive. One of the voters is randomly given the power to put whatever transactions he wants in the block.


The hashes of blocks are mostly random and outside of the miner's control, so you can securely and deterministically generate a random number from this hash. (Some provably-fair lotteries have used this technique.) Using random numbers generated in this way, the network chooses a few satoshis (Bitcoin base units) from the set of all satoshis ever issued. The people who own these satoshis at the time of the block are the selected voters.

Miners shouldn't get any special say over who can be a full node. Not only is it against the spirit of Bitcoin (Bitcoin is not a democracy), but miners' incentives are totally wrong. Miners want to include as many transactions as possible to get more fees. But if blocks become too large, then some people can't keep being full nodes, and Bitcoin becomes more centralized.


Voting is not a market force.


Gavin's proposal for transaction fees is to listen on the network for new transactions, track how long it takes them to get into blocks, and then find a correlation between the transactions' fees and confirmation times. Miners don't vote in this system, and all of the proposals I've seen involving miner voting are bad.


That was not a vote. It was just to determine when enough miners had upgraded. If most miners refused to upgrade, then the change could have been forced without miner consent (though this would have been more messy).

Yes, it comes with Bitcoin-Qt. Bitcoin-Qt is bitcoind with a GUI. You can even run Bitcoin-Qt with the -server switch to get all of the features of bitcoind plus a GUI.
bitcoind is a full node. Some lightweight clients also have APIs like this, but it's safer for you and better for the network to use bitcoind. Services like BitPay almost always use bitcoind to interface with the Bitcoin network.

You can change the code as easily as he can. He's more likely to convince other people to run his code, but if his change is stupid and your change is great, your change might be preferred by more people.
Bitcoin Core doesn't have any auto-update mechanism. Unless you manually update Bitcoin Core, your client will follow the rules no matter what, even if a majority of miners or Bitcoin nodes disagree with you. ("The rules" allow the majority of mining power to have control over one particular thing that probably can't be reasonably decided any other way, but there are strong limits on the powers that this grants them.)

The most commonly used curves are the NIST P-xxx curves. Only these curves are supported by GnuTLS, for example. These curves' constants are supposed to have been chosen using a verifiably random process. But in 2013 Bitcoin's Greg Maxwell discovered that the random process for selecting these constants was in fact very non-random. Since the NSA was known to have been involved in the creation of these curves, the P-xxx curves are now widely untrusted. But they're still very common because other curves are not universally supported yet. I assume that the B-xxx curves are similarly non-random, though I haven't checked that.
(I also remember reading somewhere that some of NIST's recommended curves are much weaker than they should have been, but I can't find detailed info on this now, so maybe I'm remembering that incorrectly.)

No matter how much you *want* it to be the case, or how much *demand* there is, the software/network can't handle an infinite max block size. 10 MB would *maybe* be possible, but 100 MB would either destroy Bitcoin outright or cause Bitcoin to become almost entirely centralized.
People already complain about the large block chain size. Would *you* run a full node if you had to store 5 TB of data per year and constantly download and upload data at a rate of 170+ kB/s? (These are the numbers for 100 MB blocks.) Keep in mind that lightweight clients are [only safe if most of the economy is running full nodes]( If an increase in the max block size causes almost no one to run full nodes, then Bitcoin will no longer be secure for anyone.
Software changes can improve this to some degree. In particular, block pruning (probably in Bitcoin Core 0.11), UTXO-trees-in-blocks, and Gavin's improved block propagation will significantly reduce the load on full nodes. But this stuff takes time to develop, there will still be a limit to what the network can handle, and it will probably be lower than you want. We just have to learn to deal with increased transaction fees (using off-chain transactions, etc.) if we want Bitcoin to remain useful.

Bitcoin-Qt only contacts the DNS seeds (there are several) when it first starts, so only new users would be affected if some DNS seeds were broken/compromised. And Bitcoin-Qt contacts *all* DNS seeds when it first starts, so all of the DNS seeds would have to be down or compromised to permanently screw up a node. If all of the DNS seeds are down, then there's a backup seeding mechanism: hundreds of Bitcoin node IPs are hardcoded into Bitcoin, and you'll try connecting to those.
BitcoinJ-based lightweight clients (such as Bitcoin Wallet for Android) *only* connect to peers returned by DNS seeds, which is indeed very centralized and bad.

This really highlights the lax security of a lot of Linux package management systems. If a maintainer is able to add something controversial like this, he could easily sneak in a security-breaking bug in a non-obvious way. And Gentoo isn't the only distro with policies like this, though it's probably one of the worst. I love many things about Portage, but the bad package maintenance and the lack of cryptographic authentication for packages (AFAIK) makes me reluctant to use Gentoo on important systems. 
(In this case, I'm sure that Luke-Jr has good intentions and would never willingly break Bitcoin's security. I disagree with this being enabled by default, but it doesn't matter that much. If the targeted sites don't want to be blocked, it's trivial to evade the ban.)

It's definitely a good idea not to store large amounts in EWallets, but they have their uses.
* They're more convenient if you're traveling, and they can use centralized sorts of two-factor authentication (OpenID, Yubikey, etc.) to make this more secure.
* EWallets could theoretically be cheaper if they bundled customer transactions together, though I don't know of any service that does this. Coinbase usually doesn't require a fee, though.
* EWallets are often better for privacy because your money is mixed with the money of other customers.
Unfortunately, most EWallets have unreasonably high fees or suck for other reasons.

Yeah, I get advance notice of security issues (where possible) so that I can efficiently spread the news when it's time to make it public. I've actually never sent an alert, though -- Gavin always does it.
There are people other than Gavin and myself who have the alert key, but we're the public contact points. If both of us are incapacitated, there are people who will still be able to issue alerts. If one of the alert key holders goes evil, there's a failsafe in the code to handle this.

As that demonstrates, security is really really hard. It's best to do everything possible to maximize your chances of achieving security, even when some measures may seem unnecessary. So you should avoid web-based wallets (even if you *think* they're secure), avoid reusing addresses when possible (even if you *think* your ECDSA implementation is OK), etc.

It'd be nice to do many changes at once because each hardfork is at least a little messy, but trying to do too much is likely to turn into a huge debate where nothing ever gets done. Just changing the max block size is likely to require 6 months of debate at the very least. So I expect the hardfork to be just the max block size increase and maybe a few minor, totally uncontroversial things.
The informal goal of the Bitcoin Core developers has historically been to keep old clients working for 2 years. If this policy is maintained, then the hard fork will need to be completely planned and implemented 2 years before it actually takes effect. It isn't known what the conditions will be like in 2 years, so this is very difficult, and it'll likely contribute to a desire to keep the hardfork pretty small.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin protocol development is always very slow, which is entirely appropriate for such a sensitive project. The scalability changes that Gavin has been talking about will be implemented and rolled out slowly over the next 1-3 years. These aren't changes that we're going to be seeing anytime soon.

That's what people who used MtGox thought. (Also, I've run into several ridiculous Coinbase bugs, so I don't have much confidence in their security.)
Here's an easier way to achieve good security: Buy an old computer. Put Bitcoin Core on it and use a decent wallet password that you won't forget. Make several backups of the wallet.dat every 80 transactions or so. That's it. This is slow and not quite perfect security-wise, but it's easy and still very secure. You don't have to trust random wallet software by unknown authors, craft transactions by hand, worry about leaking sensitive data, etc. Bitcoin Core is safe and stable, and its wallet encryption is state-of-the-art. I recommend using it wherever possible, even though the syncing time is annoying.
The biggest threats are losing your wallet and having your wallet stolen by malware. Solve those issues and your chances of losing bitcoins are quite small.

Nope. Doing that would be even worse. It's much cheaper to create a bunch of nodes on the network so that nearly everyone connects to you several times than it is get more mining power than the real network.
It's true that SPV nodes won't receive invalid blocks if they're connected only to trustworthy full nodes, but you can't really expect this to happen unless you configure your SPV client to connect only to full nodes that you trust to never turn evil. bitcoinj-based clients typically do peer discovery in a very simple way: they contact the DNS seeds and use the peers that they're given. Currently, the DNS seeds aren't full nodes and don't know whether the peers they're giving out are actually good. Maybe this would be improved if there was actually a hardfork. (Though clients should really not rely on centralized authorities like this...)
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:12:08


Changing the mining algorithm would not be compatible with SPV nodes. SPV nodes download the block headers and verify that everything about the mining process itself is OK: difficulty, timestamps, etc. But they don't download transactions, so they can't verify blocks completely.

There isn't an exit node when using a hidden service (.onion). I2P is very similar to Tor's hidden services.
Unfortunately, there is no rock-solid anonymity software yet. Users of Tor hidden services are *maybe* anonymous enough, but it's just a matter of time before a dedicated attacker can find a hidden service's actual location using intersection attacks. I2P is weak to the same attack. Distributed data stores like Freenet are resistant to this kind of attack, but unlike Tor and I2P, Freenet doesn't seem to be based on any solid theoretical foundation -- I feel like new research could break Freenet's security at any time. I like the design of GNUnet better, but the software is barely usable.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:24:26
Mike's point in this mailing list conversation is that even as a relay, you can be chosen to act as an introduction point for a hidden service. If you're chosen to be an introduction point for totallyIllegal.onion, then everyone who connects to this hidden service will know that you are helping to set up connections to this hidden service. Since it is technically possible for Tor nodes to blacklist certain hidden services (but not supported by the default software), continuing to knowingly act as an introduction point for illegal hidden services may introduce legal risk in some jurisdictions, or at least make the node operator feel uncomfortable.
The ideal solution is to somehow make it impossible for introduction points to know which hidden services they're introducing so that they *can't* blacklist anything. I don't know if there are any proposals for this -- I don't follow Tor development.

It's also important to note that Luke wasn't appointed Gentoo maintainer by any of the core devs or anything like that.

Edit: On the other hand, many Linux distros have had various problems with packaging Bitcoin, including some security issues. The Bitcoin developers tend to recommend not installing Bitcoin via a package manager, and [recommend that distros not even include Bitcoin in their package managers without serious care]( At least you can be pretty sure that Luke's package will be secure and stable, since there aren't a lot of people who know Bitcoin as well as him.

I've never figured out how to solve DoS attacks properly.

I really don't trust them, and I'd like to avoid trusting any of these fairly amateur-looking DoS protection companies if there's any possible alternative.
Does anyone know how to defend against large (&gt;10 Gbps) DoS attacks without a DoS protection company? I don't know a lot about how the Internet works at a hardware level. This DoS attack was a SYN flood that simply caused the server's Ethernet adapter to reach its maximum capacity. How are you supposed to handle this? Just buy a lot of high-capacity Ethernet adapters?

No one who knows anything doubts your immense contributions to Bitcoin. Thanks for all of your work!
Yeah, it always makes me uneasy to use the term "core dev" because it's not well-defined and I don't want to exclude anyone. But it's always tempting to use the term because there's been a very convenient list of "core devs" on bitcoin.org since shortly after Satoshi left (IIRC), these people actually are all top Bitcoin experts, and I perceive that there actually is some difference between core devs and non-core devs in the development process.
If there's ever consensus to stop using the term, I could remove the icons from bitcointalk.org, and Saïvann could remove the list from bitcoin.org

It does. That's a pretty good defense. An attacker could still fill up most of the subnets with his nodes, though. A large botnet or government would be able to do it. I also wouldn't be surprised if there were other ways of tricking Bitcoin nodes into preferring your nodes.
Bitcoin has a huge advantage here because you have 8+ peers, and *all* of them need to be evil for a *long time* in order to cause serious problems. With Tor, you can be deanonymized if you *ever* happen to form a circuit with an evil node as both the entry node and the "exit" node (for hidden services, this is the node that connects to the rendezvous point).

All of the machinery is already in place for pruning in Bitcoin Core. It would be trivial to make it operate without the 20GB blkxxxx.dat files. The problem is that if everyone did this, then no new nodes would be able to join the network because new full nodes need to download the entire unpruned blockchain. The plan to resolve this is that each node will store a random range of historical blocks (maybe a couple GBs per node), and then new nodes will need to talk to several nodes to get the whole chain. I think that this is planned for the next major release of Bitcoin Core, 0.10.

You're misreading that quote. I'm not defending the choice of 21 million in particular (though this is unchangeable for Bitcoin now), and certainly not by appealing to Satoshi as an authority. There were multiple possible strategies for BTC distribution. Maybe it would have been better to maintain a fixed monetary inflation rate, for example. My point in that quote is that it would have been impossible to dynamically adjust the supply to meet demand (as the Federal Reserve tries to do for USD), and that a fixed algorithm for coin distribution is OK if it's somewhat reasonable. (Permanent 20% monetary inflation probably wouldn't have been OK, for example.)
Similarly, it's probably impossible for the max block size to automatically adjust to meet demand, and it's OK for the max block size to be defined by a fixed algorithm if the algorithm is somewhat reasonable.

Your wallet should tell you how many confirmations a transaction has. When a transaction goes from 0 to 1 confirmation, it is said to have been "confirmed". The recipient will see the same number of confirmations. A transaction with 0 confirmations hasn't yet completely "gone through" -- you can't trust transactions with 0 transactions because they might be reversed or never be confirmed. Transactions with 1 or more confirmations can also be reversed, but it becomes increasingly more difficult as the number of confirmations increases.

No one should use this. The randomness issue completely breaks it, and there are other red flags. For example, it encrypts each block of the message separately instead of encrypting a secret key and then using symmetric encryption.
I haven't seen this encryption algorithm before. I don't know if it's weak. The ECC encryption here is done like this:
* Let G = generator, da = private key, Qa = public key
* Get the message point M by setting Mx = the message block and then finding the appropriate My on the curve.
* Generate a random number k in the curve's order. (This is done in an insecure way.)
* T = G * k
* U = Qa * k + M = da * G * k + M
* The ciphertext is (T,U)
* V = da * T = U - M
* M = U - V

With this proposal, every block mined using normal mining will also need to be approved by a few people selected randomly from everyone who holds bitcoins. Someone holding 10 bitcoins will be twice as likely to be selected as someone holding 5 bitcoins. People selected in this way will also receive some of the mining reward. However, you must be running a full node to participate in this way.
I like this proposal a lot. It fixes several problems with Bitcoin at once:
* 51% attacks are made much more difficult.
* Users are incentivized to run full nodes, which is important.
* Miners lose all power over choosing which transactions to confirm. Instead, this power goes to randomly-selected Bitcoin users. I think that this would result in much better/fairer transaction selection overall.
* Miners are required to run a full node. Currently, it's possible to mine without a full node, and this is very bad for the network. (This isn't actually a major problem with Bitcoin currently, but maybe it could be one day.)
* Pooling is made less dangerous/likely.
Also, you'll be able to make small amounts of money by simply holding bitcoins and running a full node, which is pretty cool IMO.
Adding this to Bitcoin would require several big changes, and it wouldn't be backward-compatible, but I could definitely see it being adding if there are ever major problems with the current proof-of-work. Backward-incompatible changes can't be smoothly added without ~2 years of careful advance planning, so this certainly won't be added anytime soon unless Bitcoin breaks down completely due to its PoW flaws.

The network needs to completely agree on this. Say that there's no limit, but most miners are producing 1 MB blocks for whatever reason. Then someone mines a 3 MB block. If half of the economy accepts blocks only up to 2 MB in size and half of the network accepts blocks up to 3 MB in size, then these two halves of the network will split forever and never again be able to transact with each other (as long as they don't change). This breaks the network.
There are various things that you might think of to solve this problem, and they've probably all been thought of before. The most common first-impression idea is that you'll have miners decide it. (In fact, you may have been implicitly assuming that this is how it would work, but currently even if 99% of miners mine too-large blocks, they will be ignored by the Bitcoin economy.) The problem with this is that miners nearly *always* have an incentive to create larger blocks because it gives them higher fees, but they don't have much incentive to be worried about the long-term consequences of larger blocks. You should not be *prevented* from running a full node (the only type of node with any real security) because a handful of miners in China decide to mine blocks that are too large for your bandwidth/hardware to handle.

To add to that: Reducing forks at the tip of the chain is more important than just making things more convenient for miners. We're able to say with some amount of rigor/confidence that Bitcoin's block chain will eventually converge to one single globally-accepted chain only by assuming that communication delays (etc.) are insignificant. This is certainly the case with Bitcoin's 10-minute block times, but as you reduce the target block time, non-mining factors become more and more important. *Maybe* 1-minute blocks could be possible, but with 5-second blocks, non-mining factors such as network delays would be extremely significant, and so there'd be no theoretical basis for the idea that the chain would converge to one global consensus. The practical result of such a small target block time would be that huge forks in the chain would likely be the norm, and *no* amount of confirmations would be safe, or else significant centralization would naturally result in order to reduce the effect of network delays. (Due to increased communication delays, the same sort of centralization would happen if Bitcoin was extended into space: All miners would need to be located on one planet, whichever one has the most mining power.)

MultiBit has no way of knowing whether blocks are following the rules or not. It only downloads headers. If a block contains an invalid script, creates too much BTC, etc., then MultiBit will have no idea and will continue using the longest chain, even if it's invalid. SPV clients like MultiBit trust entirely that the majority of mining power is following the rules of Bitcoin, as they can't verify the rules themselves.
Of course, if a hardfork changes the protocol so much that MultiBit can't even download headers that it considers valid, then MultiBit won't be able to use the fork. But a awful lot is possible without changing the protocol this much. The max block size could be increased without MultiBit users upgrading, for example.
(I use MultiBit as an example because I think that it's the most commonly-used client of this sort, but this applies equally to all SPV clients, including all bitcoinj-based clients. Electrum is a hybrid SPV/server-assisted client, and I'm not sure how it would behave in this circumstance.)

Integers such as that one which are larger/smaller than +/- 2^53 cannot be represented exactly with double-precision floating point numbers. Integers within that range can always be represented exactly. Furthermore, if an integer can be represented exactly in a floating-point number, then you can put a decimal point anywhere in that number (without adding zeroes) and the resulting number can still be represented without losing precision, though some trailing decimals may be added which *will be removed if you round properly*. Bitcoin has a maximum of 2^51 base units, so any BTC value can be exactly stored in a double-precision number.


That's why Bitcoin's base units and limits are what they are.

You should just omit info if the alternative is saying something totally wrong. If someone thinks that sending BTC will always empty the sending address, then they could conceivably spend only part of an address's balance using an automated tool and then discard the private key thinking that the address is now empty. Also, someone with this misknowledge will be entirely unable to properly understand or use any sort of lower-level tool like the bitcoind raw transactions API without unlearning this false info.


If you think that the pool is only regenerated once every 100 keys, then "Back up Bitcoin-Qt every 100 transactions or more frequently," doesn't really make sense to begin with. Backing up more frequently than once per 100 transactions wouldn't help you much. You'd need to back up *immediately* after Bitcoin regenerated the pool each time. This would be complicated and require additional explanation.
Good advice would be: "Add up the number of addresses you created and transactions you sent since your last backup. If this number is greater than ~80, you must backup again. Weekly backups should be enough for most individuals."

BIP50 was a hard fork IMO. The previous rule, used by all versions of Bitcoin before LevelDB, was, "If accepting a block causes my node to exceed the default Berkeley DB lock limit, then the block is invalid." This rule was removed by BIP50, causing new clients to consider blocks valid that old clients would consider invalid. This is a hard fork, even if it was pretty non-controversial because the original rule was unintended and non-deterministic.
There was another hardfork-like change on February 20, 2012, but that didn't have anything to do with the block chain, so it's not strictly a hard fork.
Those two things are the only changes that could be called a hardfork AFAIK.

They don't.
Blockchain.info runs many nodes on the Bitcoin network. When another node tells a blockchain.info node about a new transaction, blockchain.info remembers the IP of that node. Sometimes this will be the actual sender, but sometimes it will just be some random person relaying the transaction through the network. There's no simple way to tell. And if the sender cares about their privacy, they'll send the transaction via Tor and the IP will be meaningless. So blockchain.info IP data is very inaccurate and probably shouldn't be used for anything.

Great response to my points...


A total of 3113.621322 BTC was donated as of the end of 2013, worth $58,546.99 at the time of donation. The additional purchasing power that the forum collected is due to my policy of conservative spending and the additional ~5500 BTC that I collected for the forum by selling advertising.
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:19:58
I actually inherited the ad fund from the previous moderators. I saved the money from MyBitcoin about a week before they ran off with everyone's BTC. ;) I usually don't think that advertising is a very useful way of helping Bitcoin, TBH, but I don't want to spend the money on something *completely* different from the intended purpose.
I'd like to get rid of the money as quickly as possible while also spending it reasonably, but I don't have the time/passion for ad efforts, so other people must organize this stuff.
I think that the Starcraft tournament was a pretty good use of money. There were many viewers, and the announcers mentioned and Bitcoin many times. I also think that gamers are a really good target audience -- they are technical enough to use Bitcoin, but there's a good chance that they haven't already used it. The Reddit ads were pretty pointless. I'm not sure whether the Axiom sponsorship was useful. They started accepting BTC in their gift shop, so that's something.

It's supposed to work something like this: You deposit money and get added to the end of a queue. When the site collects sufficient money (minus fees) from other participants such that the person at the front of the queue can be paid 120% of their deposit, they get paid and are removed from the queue. If some set amount of time passes without anyone new paying, the round ends and everyone still in the queue loses their money. It's just a weird way of gambling, like high stakes musical chairs.
Now, if the operator broke the rules by keeping *everyone*'s money, then that's just a scam. I'm not sure that it could even be classified as a Ponzi scheme, ironically enough, as no one in this latest round got paid any "interest".
IMO there's a decent chance that the site is just broken, though. The operator seemed pretty serious about the service.

* [Pseudo-treechain thing]( (creates a mostly-separate currency)
* [Blinded bearer certificates]( (semi-centralized)
* [Sidechains]( (you can choose only two of these properties: fully decentralized; miners can't steal all sidechain funds; Bitcoin full nodes don't need to be full nodes on the sidechain as well)
* [Other off-chain solutions: hub-and-spoke or Ripple-like debt tracking]( (semi-centralization/fragility)

In a **hard** fork, miners have very little power. If miners mine on a fork that most businesses and users do not use, then they will be mining a useless currency and their blocks will be completely ignored by people on the other fork. SPV-based lightweight nodes such as MultiBit trust that the majority of miners are on the correct chain, so miners would be able to cause trouble for users of lightweight clients, but as long as most businesses and a lot of regular users use full nodes, miners will have no incentive to mine on the wrong chain.
A hard fork isn't a vote, though. Each Bitcoin user running a full node individually decides whether to upgrade or not. If ~everyone upgrades, you will probably want to also upgrade so you can transact with everyone else, but no one can force you to do so. Bitcoin is not a democracy: A full node will follow Bitcoin's rules *no matter what*.

I've answered it all many times. I don't really need to defend myself in detail because no one has any legal or moral *right* to influence how I handle forum funds, and I don't care too much about what (most) people think about me or my use of forum funds. I am swayed by reasonable arguments, not baseless accusations and complaints that took 30 seconds to post.
Anyway, repeating what I've said several times before:
1. The majority of forum funds are not from donations, but ads.
2. Most donations were from a time when the BTC price was very low. By not spending them immediately, I've increased their spending power immensely.
3. No one ever promised explicit results from donations.
4. About a quarter of forum funds are not held by me, but by treasurers bound by the Treasury Agreements. I'd like to increase this, but it's difficult to find trustworthy people.
5. It is [verifiable via the block chain]( that the vast majority of the forum's money just sits and does nothing. I don't use it.
6. While the forum is operated as a non-profit and provided for the benefit of the community, and while I am not the owner of the forum, it is still a private organization, not a democracy or even a shareholder-controlled corporation. Everyone has always known that *I* manage forum funds. If you don't trust me to manage the money effectively, don't donate. If you don't want to give me ad revenue to manage, don't buy ads.
7. I recently finished negotiating with a software engineering firm. They are in the initial stages of creating new forum software now. This is mainly what people wanted. (Though it's *not* why I first started collecting donations.)

I'm neither the OP nor a Trump supporter, but I have some thoughts on this.


Ideally, but that doesn't work when you have expansive welfare programs and strict anti-discrimination laws which apply to private property. In a fully voluntarist society, there would be no nation-state borders, and you could go anywhere where the property owners are OK with you being there. Since there'd be no government welfare, your presence in the country wouldn't much affect anyone but the property owners who have allowed to you enter their property. Additionally, if I thought that you were an above-average security risk, or that your way of life was reprehensible, then I could bar you from my home and business, ensuring that you posed no risk to myself and my customers. But that's not the world that we live in today, unfortunately.
So I'm ambivalent about Trump's immigration stuff. The current situation is in fact problematic (because of security/cultural/budgetary reasons, not from a protectionist jobs perspective), and maybe some of Trump's proposals will improve things (at great cost), but his way of approaching it doesn't address the core problems.
While NAFTA and TPP are bad due to their provisions which attempt to "even the playing field", Trump's protectionist trade policy is indeed unmitigatedly anti-freedom. There should be no tariffs at all, and if countries are somehow "unfair", that's their problem.

The term "ETF" has a specific meaning which GBTC does not meet. Partly as a result of it not being a proper ETF, GBTC:
* Has a large premium. Currently, you're overpaying by $135 per BTC. (Note that each share of GBTC does *not* equal 0.1 BTC. The actual conversion rate varies, and is listed on their website.)
* Has low volume.
* Has weird BTC redemption rules.
* Relies on trusting GBTC more than ETFs do.
It also has a massive 2% annual fee.

In the future, larger blocks will not have an increased risk of being "orphaned". That's a deficiency in the current network, and the solution is well-known. And mining a large block is no more difficult than mining a small block. So the cost to add a new transaction to a block you're working on will therefore be very tiny. Not zero, since the miner still has to do some work to *add* a new transaction, but very small. Pretty much any non-zero fee makes it worthwhile.
If there is really no demand for transaction space, then the blocks will remain unfilled. But massive cheap supply of anything tends to incentivize people to use it. This was seen with SatoshiDice, which unnecessarily filled up blocks because the fees were small enough that they could easily get their users to pay them. If block size was really unlimited, obviously blocks would not have infinite size, but I'd expect them to become extremely large with all kinds of stupid things.

I don't have time to organize ad efforts. The ~9.5 BTC that has been spent from the ad fund was all spent in projects organized by other people.
Edit: It turns out that Axiom was owed $300. I just paid them, so the total ad fund BTC is actually 12.14028395 BTC.

It is. If you run a full node, then your client will reject any block that creates more BTC than is allowed, even if *every* other miner and node disagrees with you. Contrary to common belief, Bitcoin is not ruled by miners. Miners have control *only* over transaction ordering. For other things, your client enforces the rules no matter what.

The Bitcoin network is made up of people, not just computers. If someone was persistent in attacking the network in this way, then the Bitcoin network would be changed to stop them somehow. Perhaps their bitcoins would be destroyed to eliminate their incentive. Perhaps the proof of work algorithm would be changed. *Something* would be done, though. The users and developers of Bitcoin are not just going to give up.


A double-spend is very obvious on the network. If any deep double-spends are seen, all merchants will stop accepting bitcoins until the issue is resolved. This will surely lower the price, and it will also prevent the attacker from stealing any more money. Also, a 51% attacker can *at most* double their existing bitcoins every 6 blocks (and this is only possible under absolutely ideal conditions). There's no way that they'd make enough money off of double-spending to make the attack worthwhile.

Monero transactions are about 50x larger than their equivalent Bitcoin transactions. So to reach Bitcoin's current volume of transactions, Monero full nodes would need a continuous bandwidth of at least about (1MB * 50)/(10*60 seconds/block) = 83 kB/s. Probably much more than this would be required for an average node -- this is the theoretical minimum. It's not an impossible bandwidth even for many home users, but that much bandwidth is still a very high cost for full nodes. Monero transactions also require more computation to verify, but I don't know exactly how much compared to Bitcoin transactions; this might actually be more of a bottleneck than the bandwidth.
Additionally, Monero archival nodes dealing with Bitcoin-level tx volume would need to store about (1MB * 50 * 6 blocks/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year) = 2.6TB per year. In Bitcoin, all but a few GB of this could be discarded due to pruning by non-archival nodes, but while Bitcoin full nodes can prune everything except UTXOs, Monero full nodes must store even spent TXOs forever. Monero can prune witness data and maybe some other stuff, but this only gets you a constant-factor reduction in storage. So storage-wise, Bitcoin scales more-or-less *O(1)*, while Monero scales *O(n)*, where n is the number of transactions.

The reason that jobs leave the US is that they have some *reason* to leave. It's not as if a lot of companies suddenly started thinking that they wanted to be charitable to Mexico, and so moved their factories down there. By far the biggest reason that jobs leave is burdensome regulations. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, each manufacturing job costs employers an average of $19,564 in regulations per employee per year in the US. That's regulation *alone*, not including any salary, health insurance, benefits, payroll taxes, etc. Additional reasons for abandoning the US include corporate tax rates, minimum wage restrictions, and a lack of people who are willing to do the desired work. (I am aware that Trump is working to improve some of this, which is good.)
Similarly, in trade, there's always some *reason* why things are made elsewhere instead of in the US. Often it's due to the above-mentioned governmental issues. Sometimes it's due to natural factors; for example, not very much of the US is suitable for growing sugar, so not much sugar is grown here. That's just a natural factor of the sugar business. But the sugar lobby got together and got a tariff put on sugar imports, resulting in across-the-board higher prices of sugar for US consumers, which is why US food items often use the cheaper high fructose corn syrup instead of real sugar.
Tariffs and other protectionist restrictions mainly hurt the people inside of the country. It might increase employment slightly, but this'll be totally outweighed by increased prices.
Additionally, the obsession with maintaining traditional sorts of jobs is, I think, grasping onto a largely irrelevant piece of the past. Many of these jobs will eventually become obsolete due to automation anyway, and the whole idea of an 8-hour work day *should* also eventually disappear. Consider that even hundreds of years ago, it was quite common for one man to be able to single-handledly support his wife and children. Now, two people can work like crazy and still struggle to make ends meet, even though at this point in history, you'd expect people not to have to work nearly as much. Some of this has to do with cultural changes which encourage over-spending, but a lot of it has to do with overall economic conditions. Most importantly, the government is soaking up more than half of all economic activity. Imagine if you didn't have to pay any significant tax: depending on your tax bracket, you could reduce your hours worked per day by 10-50% while retaining the same standard of living. And that percentage only takes into account the direct effect of federal tax: you're also affected more indirectly (and often even more strongly) by regulations, corporate and other taxes, tariffs, etc.

For example, a sidechain could have a rule where BTC holders can no longer buy into the sidechain at the fixed exchange rate after some point in time. BTC-&gt;Sidechain conversions after that point would have to be done on the market at a floating exchange rate. (This is like the sidechain being programmed to become an altcoin after some point in time.) Then if any BTC holders don't buy into the sidechain before then, and the sidechain becomes way more popular than Bitcoin, then the BTC holders' BTC will lose a lot of value. I don't think that anything like this scenario is likely, though. A sidechain is much more useful when people don't have to worry about this possibility, so any sidechain that tries it will be at a competitive disadvantage against Bitcoin and other sidechains.
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:59:33
There's no way to increase the max block size without a hard fork because the max block size is a core parameter of the Bitcoin network exactly like the 21 million BTC limit. Bitcoin full nodes will enforce this rule *no matter what*, even if every other node and miner on the network disagrees.
However, there are *many* possible ways of increasing the network's transaction capacity without directly increasing the max block size. For example, miners could be allowed to create "overflow blocks" containing any number of additional transactions, attaching these overflow blocks to their regular blocks by inserting the overflow block hash into their regular blocks. This can be done with a softfork. (This is similar to the idea of sidechains.)
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:42:48
I don't believe in regulations at all, but their thinking would be: Regulated ETFs need to meet exhaustive standards, and so their risks are well-known and very limited. Due to the way that ETFs are required to be structured and regulated, if you buy shares in an ETF, you don't have to worry about the ETF issuer running away with the money, going bankrupt etc. They're supposed to be very lightweight passthroughs to the underlying assets, with essentially zero added risk. A Bitcoin ETF would probably have unusual added risks, such as the risk that the ETF's bitcoins are stolen. There are no ETFs with comparable risks, since ETFs are usually based on intangible securities whose transactions can always be reversed, or sometimes (rarely) they're based on physical assets that are difficult to steal.
I think that a Bitcoin ETF *is* quite a bit different from all other ETFs currently in existence, so while I don't think that the government *should* block it (or anything), IMO it's likely that they will. I think that people who want this sort of security would have more luck creating either an ETN or an ETF which tracks the BTC price by trading Bitcoin derivatives rather than actually holding BTC. Both of those require the cooperation of a large financial institution, though.

The difficulty can't increase (or decrease) by more than 4x in a single difficulty period. So it'd take 17 retarget periods to get from the starting difficulty of 1 to the current difficulty of 11756551916. ("Difficulty 11 billion" means "11 billion times more difficult than the starting difficulty of 1", BTW.) Each one will be much shorter than two weeks, though, since the network will solve blocks much more quickly than intended. The current network can solve over 24 million difficulty-1 blocks per second, for example.
Without this limitation, it'd take only a few retargets. After 2016 blocks, the network would see that 10 minute's worth of blocks were generated in just a few seconds, and the network would ramp up the difficulty immensely.

You're right that the difference isn't huge, but it's still better to be able to say that you verified the entire history.
How it will probably work in the future is:
* When you first start Bitcoin Core, it'll be a SPV node. (Block headers only.) This'll take only a few minutes.
* The protocol will be changed so miners have to insert the root of a tree of all unspent outputs in their blocks. You'll get one of these from an old (~1000 blocks deep) block, download all unspent outputs from the network, and then verify all later blocks using this data. Now you're a "semi-full node".
* Then you'll very slowly download old transaction data in the background. Eventually (maybe after many months) you'll have downloaded and verified everything and you'll be a real full node.
Due to pruning, downloading old transaction data will require only bandwidth, not much extra storage. Storage of transaction data will be distributed, so every node will store only a few gigabytes (configurable) of historical blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-10 23:16:42
Depends on its configuration. You *can* run a full node with only about 1 MB/block \* 6 blocks/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 30 days/month = 4.4 GB per month, if you have only one connection and run with `blocksonly`. A pruned node (without historical blocks) will use perhaps a few dozen GB per month due to redundancy in transaction/block relaying. When nodes use a ton more bandwidth than this, it's usually because they don't have pruning enabled and other nodes are requesting historical blocks from them. The Bitcoin Core repo contains a `tc` script in the `contrib` directory to limit instantaneous bandwidth to some kB/s value, and there's also the `maxuploadtarget` switch for bitcoind which limits outbound bandwidth per day.

This is a flaw in the Bitcoin network which will eventually be fixed. It can't be relied upon. IBLT and weak blocks (on Core's roadmap) will address this. Gavin's headers-first proposal is also an attempt to improve this issue.
Furthermore, I often see people saying, "Miners have an incentive not to create absolutely massive blocks because _____." But it's not enough to show that *some incentive exists somewhere* -- to convincingly show that loosening the max block size is safe, you need to show that miners (even malicious miners) will *never* bring the average block size to unsafe levels.

This was in 2011 when Bitcoin was very small, so the site's community was very small. Maybe up to a few hundred users. The site worked based on tags, not sections/"subreddits". Only a few submissions per day. The cost to upvote something was fixed, though I don't remember the exact cost; maybe around $0.50. There wasn't any separate tipping system. Witcoin didn't have any cost for upvoting comments, only submissions, though I don't know if this was good. I think that you would usually get a few dollars if you made a popular submission, since something like 25% of the upvote cost went to submitters. No one was making tons of money off the site, though.
For each upvote, something like 1% was taken by the site, 25% went to the submitter, and the rest was split among everyone who upvoted it. I think that the split for voters was close to even, but with some extra weight given to earlier voters.
You should ask on  and  to see if anyone else remembers the details better than I do. I wasn't all that active on the site. Someone might even have the source code.

The term "mining" wasn't commonly used until long after Bitcoin's creation. Satoshi never used the word. To mine bitcoins was to "generate", and the person doing this was a "generator".
The earlier you go, the more difficult it is to understand stuff written about Bitcoin, since the modern vocabulary only evolved gradually over time. The original paper was written months before Bitcoin even *existed* as a network/currency. So it contains confusing stuff like this paragraph, which a newbie has basically no hope of properly understanding (my updated vocabulary in brackets):


Satoshi often spoke as though nodes, full nodes, and miners were more-or-less the same thing, since this was the situation at the time. He didn't foresee pooled mining, and to the extent that he foresaw ASIC/GPU mining, it was a vague and far-off thought. Early on he very clearly thought that it'd be OK for only relatively major players to run full nodes and mine in the future, but especially later on he said things like:






(Context of the above quote: BitDNS was a proposal to do DNS using an on-chain scheme similar to the idea of colored coins. Ironically, I was one of the main people pushing for BitDNS, and I argued with Satoshi about his stance here.)
This *argumentum ab Satoshi* stuff is so pointless, though, since you can find tons of quotes from him supporting pretty much whatever you want, not everything he said is automatically *correct*, and no matter what he thought originally, he very well could've changed his mind by now.

Currently, 0-confirmation transactions are roughly as secure as credit card transactions: they prove that you have the money "in your account", but it's pretty easy for the buyer to reverse the transaction. It might be a little easier to reverse 0-conf transactions than to do a chargeback, though while chargebacks can be done even weeks later, a Bitcoin transaction will become essentially irreversible in less than an hour. (Reversing any legitimate transaction is fraud and is illegal in both cases, of course.)
0-conf transactions are identical to confirmed transactions data-wise, they just haven't been included by miners in a block yet. Unconfirmed transactions are broadcast around the network in the same way that blocks are. The seller (and every full node seeing the transaction) verifies it like any transaction: check that the outputs being spent are unspent, verify the scriptPubKey+scriptSig, etc. But because they're not in a block yet, they're fairly easy to reverse.
Bitcoin transactions are more expensive (when dealing with small amounts) and slower than credit card transactions because credit card companies just have to make a little change to their database to handle each transaction-- your Bitcoin transaction needs to be cryptographically verified by *every Bitcoin full node* and timestamped by the most powerful computing system in existence. In the future, small transactions will be handled by something built on top of Bitcoin that will allow near-free and near-instant transactions at the cost of reduced decentralization and/or reduced security (reduced *only* for for small, mostly-unimportant transactions like that). There are various proposals for doing this (Lightning, StrawPay, sidechains, etc.), and it's not clear yet which one will actually become popular.

Cuckoo is intended to have negative expected value so that it behaves more like a lottery than a realistic business idea.


Probably to some degree, but botnets might not even be the majority, and they'd probably be more decentralized than miners today
My preferred proposal is a hybrid of SHA-3+cuckoo+PoS, mixed in such a way that you need to control *all three* to successfully attack the network. While each of these might have internal centralization, it would be exceptionally difficult to control all three at the same time. I described one simple way of combining them [here]( though there are some obvious downsides to that particular solution.

Not necessarily. The hardfork could adjust the SegWit weight calculation at the same time. BlueMatt once proposed a 2MB base-block-size hardfork that simultaneously reduced the SegWit discount from 75% to 50%. This'd result in:
* 1MB-1MB-1MB without anything.
* 1MB-~2MB-~4MB with just SegWit.
* 2MB-~2MB-~3MB with SegWit + BlueMatt's hardfork
Since it actually tightens the block size range compared to SegWit, this sort of hardfork might be less controversial.
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:23:19
Yes, they do reduce security because:
* Latency becomes a larger factor. This promotes centralization and also helps attackers, who can often control latency better.
* Stales (generated blocks that lose to some other block that was generated at around the same time) will become more common due to the latency issue. This gives a slight advantage to someone executing a "51% attack" because such an attacker always has zero stales -- they always build on top of their own blocks, so none of their blocks can be rejected. This reduces the network's effective hash rate.
* More block headers increase disk/bandwidth requirements and may therefore cause a decrease in the number of full nodes. They also make it much more expensive to run even SPV (lightweight) nodes.
These issues might be worthwhile if you actually got something particularly good in return, but in most cases there's not much difference between 1-minute and 10-minute blocks. With 1-minute blocks, you can still sometimes need to wait 10+ minutes for a confirmation, so it's still unsuitable for point-of-sale.

You're basically reinventing an idea already long-known, called UTXO commitments.
When doing verification, full nodes have a high-speed database of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), which is what defines the "balances" of all addresses. This is currently a couple of GB. The full 100GB+ block database is never accessed as part of the process of verifying transactions, as that would be too slow. The full block database is only used to serve blocks to peers doing the initial sync, and more recent blocks in the full database are used for reorganizations. Moreover, if you enable pruning, then your node will discard almost all of the 100GB+ block database, and only need to store the much smaller UTXO database. Pruned nodes are just as secure as non-pruned (aka archival) nodes -- you only need the UTXO set to do full verification.
With UTXO commitments, miners are required to include a hash of the correct current UTXO database, probably via some sort of hash tree. This can be used to get reduced syncing time by sacrificing some security, or to sync backward instead of forward so that your semi-full node becomes useful more quickly, and for some other purposes. But it doesn't help CPU usage (mostly spent verifying ECDSA signatures), bandwidth usage, or UTXO-set growth, which are the main scaling bottlenecks.
The main reason that UTXO commitments haven't been added to Bitcoin despite being known for many years is that there have been dozens of proposals in this vein over the years, but no clear agreement on which one is best.

Nielsen's law seems really really informal. It's apparently just one guy's experience. He doesn't even mention whether his upgrades came with increased cost. My own home Internet connection's upload speed has actually decreased slightly over the last 4 years. But that's also just an anecdote. I'd like to see some serious study in this area which looks at worldwide bandwidth speeds for the average person, not just what's available if you're in a decently-connected city and especially interested in getting the fastest connection available.

Definitely not. Monero's scheme is hideously unscalable. If Monero ever became popular, its scaling issues would make Bitcoin's scaling problem look like nothing, and it'd be basically certain to crash and burn.
If there was some magical fungibility fix that had no downsides other than the hardfork, and for some reason it couldn't be done as a softfork, then I would support it. But such a thing doesn't exist.
* Monero doesn't scale *at all*.
* zcash requires trusted setup, relies on immature crypto, and might also have scaling issues (not sure about the details of its scaling properties)
* MimbleWimble will be 100% wiped out by quantum computing, and can't support many types of contracts.
Also, nearly all hardforks can be done as softforks by creating a Bitcoin-security sidechain with the desired new rules. Though sometimes a hardfork would be cleaner than this in some ways.


No, there's no point in miner signalling for hardforks. I talked about that [here](


In BIP9 and ISM, miners *signal readiness* for softforks. Miners have no decision-making power, and therefore do not vote.

In an emergency, the absence of ASICs can't really be avoided. In a non-emergency, the algorithm would be published 6-24 months in advance due to the hardfork rollout delay, so ASICs might already exist by the time it activates.
It might be the case that botnets would not have all that much GPU power because people who get infected with botnet malware probably have not-so-great GPUs. I don't know.
Even if botnets would dominate, I'm not sure that this is a major problem. Botnet operators can't be trusted, but at least botnets are pretty distributed. It's probably unlikely that there would often be individual botnet operators with more than 20% of the network. When a miner has a small percentage of the network, they tend to gain more from cooperating than attacking the network.
One interesting idea I heard was that even-numbered blocks could use one PoW, and odd blocks could use another: one ASIC-friendly PoW which would have a few big mining farms like today, and one ASIC-resistant PoW which would probably have a lot of botnets. This would encourage mining decentralization. However, many experts suspect that it's not actually possible to build a PoW algorithm that ASICs will never be able to compute far faster/cheaper than consumer hardware.

(It sounds to me that you're mostly concerned with disk space, but in reality the main scaling bottlenecks turn out to be bandwidth and CPU usage.)


I don't think that transactions are very compressible due to their high entropy, as you say. Maybe a few bytes could be saved.


Each opcode is only one byte, so the Script overhead for a P2PKH transaction is only 7 bytes. The flexibility is probably worth the cost.


There's already a technique known for limiting the maximum size of the UTXO set, called STXO commitments, and it doesn't require reducing Bitcoin's precision. Probably the size of the UTXO set is unlikely to become a very large problem until far in the future, though.


It's not, and Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 allows you to discard this old data by running with the -prune=550 option (550 means that you store 550 MBs of old block data - the minimum). In the future, possibly blocks older than a couple of years will be completely forgotten by the network, and intermediate-age blocks will be distributed throughout the network BitTorrent-style, but right now pruning nodes still need to download the entire block chain from "archive nodes" during the initial sync.
Additionally, it's probably not necessary for everyone on Earth to know about everyone else's coffee-purchase transactions. The Lightning Network, currently in development, is an attempt to "cache" transaction traffic within localities, somewhat like a (decentralized) CDN. (The "localities" won't just be geographic, though.)
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:36:28
Bitcoin is insecure unless most businesses and at least a decent percentage of regular people use [full nodes]( as their wallets. Running a full node requires downloading every transaction performed on the Bitcoin network. People already complain about the large block chain size. Would *you* run a full node if you had to store 5 TB of data per year and constantly download and upload data at a rate of 170+ kB/s? (These are the numbers for 100 MB blocks -- about 300 transactions per second.) If an increase in the maximum transaction rate (related to the max block size) causes almost no one to run full nodes, then Bitcoin will no longer be secure for anyone.
Software changes can improve this to some degree. In particular, block pruning (probably in Bitcoin Core 0.11), UTXO-trees-in-blocks, and Gavin's improved block propagation will significantly reduce the load on full nodes. But this stuff takes time to develop, there will still be a limit to what the network can handle, and it will probably be lower than you want. We just have to learn to deal with increased transaction fees (using off-chain transactions, etc.) if we want Bitcoin to remain useful. Simply increasing the allowed number of transactions because we want more transactions would either destroy Bitcoin outright or cause it to become largely centralized, which eliminates its main benefit over other currencies and payment systems.
What I support, and what I think will happen (more or less) over the next decade is:
* Fees will continue to increase slowly as the demand for Bitcoin transactions increases.
* This will drive the creation of cheaper and easier to use off-chain transaction systems. Changetip is an example of an off-chain transaction system, though you can use cryptography to make these systems far safer, more anonymous, and more transparent than the basically bank-like services that exist today.
* People will use native/on-chain Bitcoin for transactions above $10 or so, and off-chain transaction systems for smaller amounts. Tools will be created to switch between Bitcoin and off-chain transactions seamlessly so that end-users don't need to worry much about the difference.
* Once pruning and a few other things are added to Bitcoin Core, the maximum block size will be increased to 5-10MB, and a very conservative automatic adjustment of the max block size will be added. (The exact numbers here are controversial.)
* Whenever the Bitcoin network is improved to be significantly more efficient, or when the average worldwide bandwidth increases significantly, the max block size will be manually adjusted upward more quickly than the automatic adjustment calls for.
* Bitcoin fees will therefore be kept under control even as demand increases, though they'll probably always be too high to support microtransactions. Off-chain transactions will always need to be part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. At times, especially in the next 2-3 years while the technology isn't quite there yet, fees might become uncomfortably high. But the solution will not be to increase the transaction rate beyond what Bitcoin can actually support, but to improve off-chain technology to fill in the gaps.

I'm not saying that at all. Consent is certainly extremely important. If MtGox said that they will keep customer bitcoins in full reserve, then they must do so. But I doubt that they specified what they would do with deposited bitcoins.
Can you find an agreement for a major US bank that tells customers what will be done with their funds? I haven't studied bank agreements closely, but I've never seen something like that. They'll say that withdrawals may be delayed, but they don't say anything like "Deposited funds may be used on risky investments," or, "We only keep a very small percentage of deposited funds on hand at any one time," or even, "We must eventually return deposited money." I imagine that MtGox's ToS was similar, and so I don't see much difference between MtGox's fractional reserve (if it existed) and a regular bank's fractional reserve.
I am not claiming here that what banks do is ethical, BTW. I'm just drawing a comparison to put the ethical issues in context. Both "MtGox is clearly unethical, so banks might also be unethical" and "Banks are clearly ethical, so at least the basic idea of fractional reserve in MtGox's operation might have been ethical" would agree with the ideas in my original post. I'm also certainly not claiming that MtGox is innocent, that there probably wasn't a lot of unethical activity in MtGox's operation, or that MtGox customers have no reason to be angry.

If I've registered silkroad.bit as a hash using some nonce, then the miners probably won't know to block it the first time. When I go to renew it, though, my renewal transaction will somehow need to be linked to the first transaction or else anyone could "renew" it and take control of the domain. Maybe the second transaction could hide its association with the first transaction until it has been sufficiently buried in the block chain. This might be a good direction for further thought.
The DNS system also somehow needs to guarantee uniqueness, which is complicated by censorship-resistance. If no one knows that I've registered silkroad.bit, then how will the network know when someone else registers the same domain?
I don't have the answers here, though this is something that I have *long* been interested in seeing created. (Before Namecoin existed, in fact.) Lately I've been thinking about it more. If anyone wants to discuss the technical issues in depth and try to find solutions for some of the problems that are IMO preventing a good implementation of decentralized DNS, email me and we can work on it.

No. Full nodes follow their rules no matter what. Even if every other Bitcoin user on Earth switches to new rules, your non-upgraded full node will ignore them unless you also switch to the new rules. This is what makes a hard fork "hard" -- even if everyone agrees on a hard fork, *every* full node needs up upgrade, which is difficult.
Except in emergencies, hard forks will be scheduled one or two *years* in advance. Most people won't need to worry about it because they'll already be using an upgraded client by the time the change actually happens.

In a hard fork, the network is split in two, and each person must individually decide to either stick with the old rules and old network or move to the new rules and new network. Miners are mostly irrelevant here. No one on the old network will automatically end up on the new network, even if *every* miner supports the new network. (Assuming you're running a full node and not a lightweight node).
In a soft fork, the majority of mining power adds a new rule to the current network. Any miners who don't support the new rule will (in most cases) have all of their future blocks rejected until they upgrade. Full nodes will automatically be subject to the rule change as long as the majority of mining power is enforcing the new rule. Only certain types of changes can be done in a soft fork. The max block size can't be increased in a soft fork, for example. The term "soft fork" is a bit confusing because soft fork changes often don't result in any substantial forking of the block chain.

The problem is that if there's even just a few stupid or generous miners who accept transactions at a loss, then miners as a group lose their ability to enforce reasonable pricing. If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security.
With very large blocks, miners need to think about rejecting transactions purely to convince people to pay more, and this probably won't end up working (as mentioned above). If miners can only include so many transactions, then this creates actual competitive demand for block space. With small blocks, miners will include the highest-fee transactions, and the fee varies only according to the demand at the time. There's no guarantee that the price arrived at through competition for block space will be correct, as it is entirely unrelated to the amount of network security that Bitcoin users need or desire. But it makes it likely that at least the most efficient miners will make a profit, which is maybe not the case with large blocks. A really conservative strategy for managing the max block size would be to keep the max block size small until we're sure that fees are high enough to support sufficient network security, and only then carefully increase the max block size.
I'm actually not really worried about this, though. I think that miners will find other ways of making money, and even if the market totally fails, assurance contract donations can probably handle it well enough.


This is my main objection to unlimited block sizes. Every full node must download every transaction. If normal people can't do this, then they can't be full nodes. If there aren't enough full nodes, then miners don't have any incentive to follow the rules.
Improvements in the Bitcoin software/network can improve this somewhat, but this technology *doesn't exist yet*. Even the fairly well-planned methods of improving things are known to only take us so far. Making it so that full nodes don't have to download every transaction would require some sort of secure distributed verification system for transaction data, but a complete solution for this isn't yet known to computer science. Removing the max block size now because we hope that technology will expand sufficiently in the future is reckless.
It's annoying that the max block size is required, but we just have to deal with it. It's also annoying that there's a limited supply of oil in the world, but we've learned to deal with that by using it more efficiently.

I've never been to Hawaii.


A significant chunk of the money is held by other treasurers, and I plan to increase this.


I've been constantly upgrading it. Just because it doesn't look different doesn't mean that I haven't made many backend changes to support the massive traffic. I've also added several big features.






There was a public request for bids for several years. I received maybe ~20 bids in that time. A couple of these bids were very promising, but the applicants became busy with other things and were unable to do it. The others failed to demonstrate to me that they could do the job. (Maybe a few of them could have done it, but a lot of applicants just contacted me to say that they could do it, but without offering any reason that I should believe them. I am not an interviewer. I'm not going to ask a hundred questions to determine your suitability for the job. You have to sell yourself to me if you want me to hire you.)
The bid prices increased as the forum's money increased. IIRC, I received at least a couple that were over $500,000. I don't remember the names of the people or firms that bid, though none of the firms had much more reputation than Slickage.
Slickage was recommended by Warren Togami, who has himself done important technical work for the forum and Bitcoin Core. I trust him. After talking to James, I was satisfied that Slickage would be able to do the job. There are many software development firms. I probably could have found one that's cheaper and better. But I don't have time to research this (I'm a full-time college student), I don't really know how to determine whether one firm is better than another anyway, and few trustworthy people were willing and/or able to help me find one. So I picked the first firm I found that was capable of doing the job well (after several years of looking).
The main factors that convinced me that Slickage would be able to do a good job were:
* When I talked with him, James convinced me that he was very familiar with all of the relevant technical issues.
* Like myself, James wants this software to become the premier forum software on the Web. He wants to sell custom modifications and support for this software in the future. Therefore, he has a strong interest and incentive in creating something really wonderful and having it used very successfully on bitcointalk.org.
* Slickage was recommended by Warren, and Warren is in Hawaii and able to directly supervise them to some degree.


The current balance of 1M4yNbSCwSMFLF9BaLqzoo2to1WHtZrPke is approximately how much I store for the forum. I reconcile this balance every couple months, so it could be up to about $200,000 too high or low.
I pay myself as part of the mod payments. Any additional payment for admin/development work is added at that point.

I don't pay myself very much.


There isn't much transparency in decision-making. I read/participate in public discussions, and sometimes people send me advice; from that info, I make decisions. I only make public requests for comments if I'm feeling unsure. [Here's one case where I did that]( -- there are many others.

The difficulty *will* be adjusted manually if it becomes stuck. This would be a huge hassle (it's a hardfork), but it's definitely possible. This should be extremely rare, if it happens at all, and there are known problems with shorter retarget intervals and automatic rules for unsticking difficulty, so new rules probably wouldn't be added.

You can use a signed integer. There's enough space. You can even do math on the number without converting it to a larger type, though this requires a little extra work. It's similar to the way you deal with numbers in x86 assembly.
If you can't easily deal with an unsigned integer, you're going to have real trouble implementing other parts of the Bitcoin protocol. There are at least four different types of variable-length integers, for example.

It's not really possible to increase the 21 million limit with a normal softfork. You could add more currency units, but they would be separate from original bitcoins and therefore probably worth less.
It's sort-of possible with a "firm fork", but these should probably be viewed as equivalent to hardforks.

You'd think so, but it actually significantly weakens Bitcoin's security. Consider this scenario:
* Bob sends a transaction of 1 BTC that is only valid until block 100 to an exchange at block 99.
* At block 110, I withdraw 500 BTC from the exchange. One of the inputs to this transaction is the 1 BTC that Bob deposited.
* Due to some weird disturbance in the Internet, the Bitcoin network was split 49-51 during this time. I was on the shorter side. At block 120 on the larger chain, the networks merge, and there is a reorganization. It is now block 120, but this chain does not include the original "locked-after" transaction. This invalidates the transaction I received. So 500 of my bitcoins have now vanished, even though I received them in a transaction with 11 confirmations and I'm not being attacked by the sender of the transaction or any miners.
Losing money *accidentally* like this is impossible with Bitcoin except in extremely long chain forks of more than 100 blocks. Having transactions that start valid but later become invalid makes it possible. One way of adding such transactions without hurting Bitcoin's security would be to require that anyone receiving such transactions not spend them until they have 101 confirmations, the same as the maturation time for generation transactions, which exists to prevent very similar issues.
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:19:06


Yes, but it's 101 confirmations. See:  




How fees work is that they are *added* to the 25 BTC block reward. If the total fees in a block are 1 BTC, then a miner is entitled to collect a 26 BTC reward. This is in one single coinbase transaction. Adding or collecting a fee doesn't require any extra data in transactions or blocks.
Example:  
  
This is a coinbase transaction with a total output value of 25.02490699, so the total fees are 0.02490699. The miner calculates the total fee by adding up the fees of all transactions in a block. You can get the fee for a transaction by subtracting its total output value from its total input value.

bitcointalk.org was never owned by Mark. He did provide a server for a while, though this was quite some time ago (~2012).
The forum was originally located at bitcoin.org, which was registered by Satoshi, and the initial system administration was done by Sirius. Originally the server had Drupal+SMF+dokuwiki (never MediaWiki). The bitcointalk.org domain was registered by jgarzik, later transferred to Sirius, later shared with me and Cobra. After the first hack, Mark helped investigate it, and he was the one who found the attack vector (though he didn't find the backdoor inserted by the attacker and later used in the second hack). At the same time, the forum was moved to a server provided by Mark. It stayed there for about a year before it was moved to a server provided by Private Internet Access in 2012 or 2013. Since then, bitcointalk.org has had no particular association with Mark. He's never been an admin or moderator.
If the Silk Road was using the same old version of SMF that bitcointalk.org uses, it's probably because they thought that imitating bitcointalk.org would be a good idea, either because people were used to bitcointalk.org or because they thought "good enough for bitcointalk.org, good enough for us". It'd be very interesting if the Silk Road used any of my (or Satoshi's) many private modifications to SMF -- that would certainly implicate Mark, who had access to the forum's sever for a time. But this is probably unlikely.

Probably the new PoW would be mined mainly on GPUs for the first 3-9 months, until new ASICs came into production. So I guess if you wanted to build a "militia", you'd want a lot of GPUs.
Random thought: Some older ASICs supported both sha256d and a secret manufacturer-specific version of sha256d with slight modifications, and could be configured to switch to this alt PoW. The idea behind this was that if mining attacks were coming mainly from one manufacturer, the PoW could be changed to be `(new_PoW OR manufacturer_1's_alt_PoW OR manufacturer_2's_alt_PoW OR ...)`, but excluding the abusive manufacturer's alt PoW. Then the network would still retain a lot of hashrate immediately after the PoW change. Unfortunately, I think that the alt PoW project was abandoned a year or two ago due to it being too time-consuming and difficult to convince manufacturers to do it, so I don't think that any modern hardware supports an alt PoW. But if it's necessary to change PoW, it might make sense to look into supporting the old alt PoWs. Then people who have obsolete mining hardware laying around might be able to get some use out of it again, the Bitcoin network will get an immediate boost in hashrate after the PoW change, and this hashrate will be from miners who are probably fairly likely to be trustworthy. (I don't know which mining hardware had alt PoWs.)

Yes. I edited in "small/fast payments" to emphasize that people will always use a *mixture* of Bitcoin-proper and some higher-level system. The higher-level system will be used for whichever transactions are uneconomical directly on Bitcoin, and for when confirmation times must be near-instant. Bitcoin will be used directly for larger transactions that can tolerate a longer confirmation time. Probably both systems will be handled by the same wallet, and the choice of network will usually be handled automatically. The end goal will be for transactions to be as easy (or easier) than today - not some jumble of separate networks that users have to manually navigate.
"Small" and "fast" are relative, of course. I'm not sure which transactions will end up being too small to go on the main chain.

Satoshi viewed the proof of work system as being approximately one person per CPU, and one CPU per vote.

According to Mike Hearn, Satoshi even planned on creating a reputation system integrated with the Bitcoin client that would use the number of blocks you'd individually solved as part of a system to prevent scammers from creating infinitely many accounts.
He did predict and support some consolidation, but I don't think that he foresaw pools or ASICs.

Yeah, for comparison, almost all commodity ETFs are similarly either ETNs or based on derivatives. For example, industrial metals ETFs never have warehouses full of copper or whatever, since that'd be very difficult (similar to the difficulty in securely storing BTC), so instead they trade derivatives with the goal of closely approximating the gains/losses you'd get in USD terms if you actually did hold the underlying assets. AFAIK, across the entire ETF market, the only ones that actually store physical things are *some* of the precious metals ETFs.
You'd need some sort of BTC derivatives market in order to base it on derivatives, though. I've long thought that this has been sorely lacking in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but there are major regulatory issues. For the purposes of the ETF, my thinking is that it may be possible/suitable for a handful of big players to negotiate with some amenable financial institution to act as a clearing house for a small number of long-term contracts mainly for the purpose of serving the ETF.

The big problem with adaptive block sizes is that it basically gives miners the ability to choose their max block sizes by just making bigger blocks, and it's usually in miners' interest to make blocks as large as possible. So you'd expect miners to try to trick the auto-adjustment algorithm into keeping the max block size as high as possible by sending fake transactions and collaborating with each other where necessary. You might as well just use whatever hard maximum you have in mind for the auto-adjustment system, because that'll probably be the only meaningful limit. (There may be some cases where adaptive block sizes would be useful, like if one miner is spamming transactions as a DoS attack, but I think this'd be rare. And I think that you can usually prevent these same attacks using soft policy rules instead of hard consensus rules.)

Usually when people advocate off-chain transactions, they aren't saying that we should all use Coinbase. Using Bitcoin contracts and other crypto, you can do off-chain payments without trusting the payment processors with your identity or (much of) your money. If done correctly, off-chain payments will *only* be an increase in centralization for certain payments, not a decrease in privacy or safety. None of this is substantially implemented yet, though.
As much as possible, I recommend not trusting centralized services with your money. I'm especially suspicious of services like Coinbase that try to get you to use them as much as possible. Probably Coinbase isn't malicious, but they're certainly a big target, and a big single point of failure.

An increase in the actual average block size to, say, 1 GB would certainly reduce security. Only big businesses would be able to run full nodes. Since only full nodes can enforce the rules, this basically hands control of Bitcoin over to the big businesses. See:  
It's unclear at exactly what point the network would become unsafe. Most people can probably agree that average block sizes of 2 MB would be OK and that 1 GB would be disastrous with the current state of the Bitcoin network, but I'm not sure whether 100 MB would be survivable, and I'm a bit nervous about 20 MB.
Also, some people think that market forces would prevent block sizes from actually getting too high even without any max block size. (That's why I said "actual average block size" above instead of "max block size".)
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:35:37
Right after a softfork is activated, some blocks may be produced which are invalid under the new rules (most probably due to miners not upgrading). If this invalid chain is longer than the valid chain, then old and lightweight nodes will accept it and end up on a totally separate currency/network than new nodes, who will reject the invalid chain absolutely. If this situation lasted any length of time, it'd be similar to a contentious hardfork, and would be a disaster. This situation is avoided if the majority of mining power upgrades before the softfork, since it ensures that the invalid chain will not be longer than the valid chain. Due to the way Bitcoin works, only miners factor into this, since only they produce blocks.
Mining is the weakest, most centralized aspect of Bitcoin. If you could do mining such that each Bitcoin full node *owned by a distinct individual* had an equal chance of solving the next block and receiving a reward as any other such node, then that'd be far more decentralized and therefore better. And it still wouldn't be *democratic* because nodes would still absolutely reject invalid blocks. It'd be even better to get rid of the concept of mining entirely. However, nobody knows how to do this in a secure and decentralized way. Many, many altcoins have made attempts to improve mining decentralization, but their attempts have either demonstrably failed or are known to have theoretical weaknesses. And all semi-working attempts to remove mining entirely have had to rely on strong centralization, which completely defeats the point. So Bitcoin's pure PoW still seems to be the best we can do for now.
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:07:19
Satoshi's original paper doesn't cover all of the aspects of Bitcoin today. In reality, an attack by miners like that has to be addressed by changing the PoW in a hardfork. If you consider this to be impossible, then yes, Bitcoin is quite fragile. In fact, if a PoW change is impossible, then you can immediately conclude that Bitcoin is already doomed, since miners would have very little incentive to keep following the rules. If the miners can't be fired, then the economy has no leverage. Rational miners would attack the network until they got whatever concessions they wanted, such as infinite inflation or whatever. The only thing that would hold them back is that they wouldn't want to crash the price of BTC too much too quickly, or else they wouldn't be able to actually get any value out of their control over Bitcoin. But there's a big difference between "Bitcoin is secure and trustless" and "rational miners won't change the rules in ways which would destroy Bitcoin *too quickly*".
If you think that miners do have absolute control over Bitcoin, then you can redesign Bitcoin to be much more efficient with this assumption in mind. I (mostly jokingly) proposed such as system [here](

If it's necessary to change the PoW (which is the appropriate response in case of attack by miners, but IMO unlikely to be necessary), then the new PoW would probably be [cuckoo]( or perhaps a two-algo or three-algo hybrid containing cuckoo. cuckoo mining is not enhanced at all by ASICs, and only slightly by GPUs. So mining would return to ordinary Bitcoin users. There'd be no need for infrastructure.

I include fractional reserve in the term "creative accounting", and I'm not so sure that fractional reserve would have been unethical in itself. I don't think that the MtGox ToS guaranteed full reserve. Banks also play with client money in sometimes-unsafe ways (though governments can print more money when banks lose customer money and can't cover the loss). I guess maybe it's ethical for banks to play with customer money, but not ethical for them to actually lose it? This seems strange to me, since the ethics of an action shouldn't depend on luck...
Anyway, I'm not saying that people should blindly support Mark or trust him with more money. At the very least, he made a bunch of serious errors in his management of MtGox, and the probability that he did something unethical is not insignificant. I'm just not willing to *hate* him before I know for sure that he was intentionally doing something really evil.

I'm just saying that MtGox was not very different from fiat banks. There are plenty of banks that have very low reserve requirements but don't pay any interest. And I don't think that this is well-known by customers.
I didn't make any particular ethical judgement of this in my post. There are plenty of good arguments for why fractional reserve in this case might have been unethical. For example, users may have had a reasonable presumption that MtGox was full-reserve (certainly if Mark said so), or it might be the case that fiat banks are also behaving unethically.

When Satoshi did the version checksum change (very similar to a hardfork), he scheduled it *2 years* in advance. (It was kind of funny because after all that time, everyone had forgotten about the change, so it looked like the network was "changing itself" without any human control.)
If Bitcoin is literally *going to completely fail* without a hardfork, the hardfork can be done immediately. For example, a 0-day total failure of SHA-256 or an attack by miners would warrant this. Otherwise, I think that you want:
* 6 months for something *critically* important. There will still be a lot of disruption.
* 1 year for something high-priority. Some people will still be affected, but probably not too many.
* 2 years for fairly minor fixes. By this time, almost no one should be affected.

There's a hard protocol rule called the max block size which limits the number of network-wide transactions to a few transactions per second. The actual number of transactions per second depends on the size of the transactions, which varies. Removing or increasing this limit would require everyone who runs their own Bitcoin wallet to upgrade their wallet software. A change to the Bitcoin network which requires everyone to upgrade is called a hard fork.
Such a small limit on the network's capacity is obviously undesirable, and many people are a bit horrified that the Bitcoin network is limited in this a way when they first learn about it. The naïve response is to just completely remove this limit, which seems at first glance to be an utterly pointless restriction on Bitcoin's scalability. (Some well-informed people also hold this view and have reasonable arguments.) However, many Bitcoin experts believe that completely removing the limit is fairly likely to cause Bitcoin to become highly centralized, or become too weak against mining-based attacks, or be destroyed entirely. But even if Bitcoin can't handle as many transactions as we'd all like, that doesn't mean that Bitcoin is useless: there are several well-explored but not-yet-implemented ideas for using Bitcoin securely, cheaply, and easily without creating "actual" Bitcoin transactions.
I might try writing an easier-to-understand but still fairly complete and accurate summary of the issue, but that'll take several hours, and I don't have time right now. Until then, [here's a propaganda video]( from someone who supports keeping the max block size at its current level for the foreseeable future, which is not what I support. The video also contains some exaggerated/controversial statements. But it's probably still an OK video for getting the basic idea.

While "take a couple of weeks to settle" should never be the norm, the idea that transactions will ever naturally expire is a common and very dangerous misunderstanding. Although Bitcoin Core will by *default* delete unconfirmed transactions from its memory pool after 3 days, anyone on the network *could* save the transaction and rebroadcast it at any time, potentially even years later. If you incorrectly assume that transactions expire after 3 days, then you can easily lose money in the following way:
1. You send 200 BTC to someone, but you accidentally don't pay enough fee, so it never confirms.
2. It "expires".
3. You resend the transaction, but with a larger fee.
4. The recipient had saved your original 200-BTC transaction, and now rebroadcasts it and performs CPFP fee-bumping on it to ensure that it confirms.
5. *Both* transactions confirm. You just lost 200 BTC.
Huge losses due to this have actually happened several times. A mistake like this is what caused BitBet to go bankrupt.

Aside from being inaccurate (the first event was a softfork, not a hardfork, and neither of them came close to killing Bitcoin), this ignores the change which was most similar to increasing the max block size: On [Feb 20, 2012]( the protocol was changed in a completely backward-incompatible way, with implications very similar to a hard fork. Anyone using an old client was disconnected from the rest of the network, and they were vulnerable to similar double-spending attacks. The reason that no one noticed this change (most people here probably haven't even heard of it) is that the change was programmed into the client 2 years in advance. You'd have to be using a client that was released over 2 years ago to be left on the old network. This is how the max block size will be increased, hopefully with the same 2-year delay. By the time the change actually happens, everyone will be using a client with the new rules because that's the only type of client that will have been advertised on bitcoin.org and elsewhere for 2+ years. You'd have to go massively out of your way to download a version without the new rules.
I think that the max block size hardfork will proceed smoothly as long as it is unanimously supported by the core devs and no more than a handful of really big Bitcoin businesses/communities decide to explicitly oppose it.
(I don't especially support Gavin's proposal because I think that it increases block sizes too quickly, but I think that some 2-year-delayed *very conservative* increase in max block size should be added ASAP.)

Some people don't consider the Berkeley DB thing a hard fork because old nodes weren't behaving deterministically. After the change (BIP 50), old nodes would reject new blocks only "randomly".

Also, I think that a network full of only old nodes could still experience this problem if any miners were using somewhat non-standard policy.

Furthermore, if someone received only a tiny amount of value, then this receipt can be delayed until future merging will allow for it to be higher-value and therefore less expensive fee-wise.
How my system works is to basically use the trusted users as a sort of cache. In the example in my post, Dean sends three IOUs. When Dean pays $20 to Alice in on-chain BTC, he's settling his $5 IOU directly and also transferring away his other two IOUs to the trusted users in return for settling $15 of their IOUs to Alice. So IOUs start out untrusted, then they're sold to the trusted users, at which point they're considered trusted/reliable, and then the trusted users either pay them or get others to pay them in return for accepting more IOUs. (This makes it sound like there'd be a cabal of trusted users, but in my system they'd be managed by the neutral tipbot, and you could even have users whose IOUs are only considered trusted up to a few dollars in total value.)


I envisioned it being public so that the tipbot's behavior can be audited. It could be kept private, but then there's a lot more opportunity for abuse by the tipbot.

* Why would Szabo use an additional pseudonym for Satoshi? If he was willing to write about bitgold under the name Nick Szabo, why not Bitcoin?
* Szabo is AFAIK not an experienced programmer.
* The evidence that Szabo is Satoshi is pretty weak. Just a bunch of coincidences and speculation. Lots of people came close to inventing Bitcoin -- all of the ideas in this space were leading toward Bitcoin, and it was only a matter of time before someone put the ideas together in just the right way. Just because people like Finney and Szabo got very close doesn't mean that they had anything to do with Satoshi.
* Szabo sometimes talks about Bitcoin development. But I believe that one reason that Satoshi left was because he wanted to avoid exerting special influence over Bitcoin development. If that's true, then he would avoid interacting with the Bitcoin developers using any name that is suspected of being Satoshi.

Namecoin has a number of problems:
* It requires all resolvers to be full nodes. So in order to use Namecoin, you need to either trust some centralized resolver or download the entire chain yourself. There is no lightweight resolver mode.
* It unnecessarily uses its own currency instead of bitcoins.
* It unnecessary requires mining. DNS can be done using something like colored coins on the Bitcoin block chain, which would be vastly safer and more efficient.
I've been thinking about DNS a lot lately. The most difficult problem that I've seen is censorship. If I want to register silkroad.bit, miners can refuse to include (or even be *required by law* to refuse) my registration/renewal transaction. Hashing the name maybe helps a little, but miners can still maintain a blacklist of names-&gt;hashes. I've had a few ideas here, but nothing yet which completely solves the problem.

The GUI fee settings can override the bitcoin.conf settings. If you want to force a fee of 0.0005 per kB, you should select "custom" -&gt; "per kilobyte" and enter the fee in the box when sending a transaction. Don't select either of the checkboxes.

Although people should try not to reuse addresses, it wouldn't have mattered in this case. This is caused by many incoming payments in general.
Basically, people should think of the transaction fee as having two components:
* Every time you receive a payment, you are "charged" a fee of fee_rate \* 148 bytes, though you don't pay it until you spend that BTC (and the actual value of *fee_rate* is determined only then).
* Every time you send a payment, you pay a fee of fee_rate \* 78 bytes
(Those numbers are for *typical* transactions.)

6 hours per week is probably fine. Where it starts to get a bit unhelpful is when you turn off your full node every night or something like that.
Your node basically announces to the entire network, "Hey, if anyone needs some help, feel free to contact me! I have the full block chain and I'm willing to serve and filter it for you." It's unhelpful if someone then tries to respond to your advertisement and finds that you're not there. All network nodes also consume some of the network's limited connection slots when running.
But if you want to run a full node for the additional security/flexibility that doing so provides, don't worry about being a drain on the network. It's not a big deal.

Fees aren't explicitly specified in transactions. If you have more input value than output value, then the difference will be the fee. It's therefore very easy to pay a huge fee if you create transactions by hand or using a very low-level tool.

Before, if you wanted to have a setup where the agreement of 2 out of 3 people was required in order to spend some money, you'd need to trust someone. Either a third party escrow, or one of the 3 people, or the legal system. Bitcoin is the first system that allows contracts like this *without any trust whatsoever*. If used properly, these smart contracts eliminate a big chunk of risk that has previously always been inherent in the financial system, and it also reduces the (apparent) need for government. Both of these changes are very positive for both individuals and society as a whole.

Be aware that when you first run a full node, it needs to download about 110 GB (currently) in order to synchronize. This is a one-time thing. If you run with pruning (`-prune=550`), then almost all of this is discarded after being processed. If you don't enable pruning, then all of this data will be stored on your disk. Pruning doesn't impact security at all, but a few more advanced pieces of functionality require that you don't have pruning enabled.

So I make over a million dollars, use this on things which are clearly intended to benefit the forum and the Bitcoin community instead of myself (even if you think the money could be better used elsewhere), and I get constantly attacked for it...

I very much disagree with the rollout strategy. It will require all users to take action pretty soon, which is disruptive and very likely to result in messiness. If users have to make an explicit choice between the old network and the new network, we're going to end up with a "war" (though maybe not a very big one) between people like Mircea Popescu and everyone else, and regular users will end up caught in the crossfire. Also, the date of the change is unpredictable. When businesses ask, "OK, we need to update. What's the deadline?", there will be no answer because it depends on what miners do. It could be never or it could be an hour from now. Finally, miners are not especially important or knowledgeable entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They shouldn't be given the power to decide issues like this. Miners should be forced to follow the supermajority of full nodes, not the other way around.
I propose doing what Satoshi did in the only other example of (something like) a hard fork: Make the change now, but have it take place at a particular date or block number 2 years in the future. Then when the change actually happens, everyone will already be updated because almost no one uses 2-year-old software. Yes, 2 years is a long time, but we'll survive.
Those numbers also look too high. I am not worried about mining incentives -- assurance contracts can handle that. I'm worried that it will become progressively more difficult for people to run full nodes, leading to centralization. This was not really addressed in the Blocksize Economics post. As time goes on, *more* people should be able to run full nodes, not less. For me to agree with these numbers, I'd like to see a comprehensive meta-analysis by a statistician showing that the worldwide bandwidth capacity is expected to grow faster than the proposed max block size schedule with high confidence. If this is not possible in the near future, or if the data is unclear, then I propose immediately adding the lowest max block size increase schedule that is agreeable to pretty much everyone, set to come into effect in 2 years. I imagine that 10 MB + some small per-block increase would be OK. If the data later shows conclusively that a larger or faster schedule is safe, it's fairly easy to do another 2-year-delayed hard fork to switch to that schedule. It is **not** easy to undo a too-fast schedule because this requires either the selfless cooperation of miners or another hard fork that will oppose the pro-centralization inertia caused by the too-large blocks and maybe also the short-term interests of Bitcoin businesses.

It doesn't normally need that much. My home server with 3 GB runs bitcoind without issue, and I also use that server for tons of other things.

Increasing the maximum connection count can significantly increase memory usage, for example.

That same thought occurred to me when I was looking at /new. I get the sense that most of these people *freaking out* and telling people to "hodl" or declaring Bitcoin dead were thinking of Bitcoin as a no-risk get rich quick scheme. It reminds me of the housing bubble: "Prices always go up!". In reality, due to the high level of monetary inflation, there's reason to think that the price will continue to have a general downward trend until the next subsidy adjustment or until there's a major increase in interest. (I actually said several months ago that I didn't consider sub-$100 prices to be out of the question.)
It's kind of sad to see so many people using Bitcoin as nothing more than a vehicle for speculation... If Bitcoin dropped to $1 and remained stable there forever, it would still be an excellent currency and payment system. Obviously you shouldn't buy much BTC if you expect this to happen (I don't...), but you can still be excited about Bitcoin's technology and the additional freedom and opportunities for innovation that it brings to the world.

I haven't used Mycelium, but in general:
For CPFP, you ideally want to be able to choose which UTXOs you're going to spend, and you have to be able to spend 0-conf UTXOs. Does Mycelium support this? If so:
* If you sent the stuck transaction, spend the 0-conf change output of that stuck transaction. (Very rarely, there is no change output, in which case this isn't possible.)
* If you received the stuck transaction, spend the 0-conf output that you received in that transaction.
If you can't select specific UTXOs, then you can resort to sending slightly more than the *confirmed* balance of your entire wallet to yourself. For example, if you have a 2 BTC confirmed balance and a stuck transaction causing an unconfirmed balance of 0.5 BTC, send 2.01 BTC to yourself. This forces the usage of some of your unconfirmed balance, which is what you want.
If Mycelium doesn't let you spend 0-conf outputs, then you probably can't reasonably use CPFP with it.
RBF tends to be more difficult to use if your wallet doesn't directly support it. To use RBF, the transaction has to be one you sent, and you have to somehow delete or abandon the stuck transaction so that you can send a replacement. Many wallets don't support this without some kludgy stuff. Very importantly, after you delete the stuck transaction, you then need to send a transaction that *conflicts* with the transaction you just canceled (ie. the new transaction should spend at least one of the same inputs as the old transaction). Otherwise the old transaction could someday go through, potentially even years later. People have lost a lot of money by spending twice due to assuming that a "cancelled" transaction would never go through: MtGox is known to have lost a lot of money this way, and this is what caused BitBet to go bankrupt. Many wallets have the absolutely insane behavior of automatically deleting stuck transactions after 72 hours without creating a conflicting transaction, which will almost always work, but is basically guaranteed to someday cause someone to lose a big chunk of BTC due to double-payment.

It was 0.003 USD *per BTC*, so it was around the same BTC/USD price as the pizza trade.
I was trying to act as a market maker at the time in order to jump-start the market, so I both bought and sold BTC in a way which more-or-less offset. (At the time, days would go by without a single trade on any market, which was a situation I wanted to fix.) 15k was just how much I sold at the all-time market low of $0.003 -- my total sub-dollar buy+sell volume was much higher. In hindsight I could've either not sold any BTC or bought hundreds of thousands of BTC for virtually nothing, but [time travel is dangerous](

With the federated micropayments I'm thinking of, I think that recipients will probably pay a monthly fee to cover the payment processor's business expenses. I don't think that expenses will be very high. With payment channels, processors won't even need to hold customer BTC very long. The main expense will be regulatory issues, I imagine. Depending on the exact costs, it might be possible for some payment processors to operate on donations.
Maybe this will all fall apart. You never know. But even if off-chain payments are completely impossible for some reason, Bitcoin's max block size probably can't be safely increased to fill in the gap. High fees would significantly reduce Bitcoin's usefulness, but it's better than nothing.
AFAIK, both Coinbase and BitPay make most of their money from a slightly adjusted BTC&lt;-&gt;USD spread.

It hasn't been removed in 0.12, but it defaults to disabled. The reason for this is:
* With the current code, it's very expensive to compute a transaction's priority.
* A bunch of past transactions were analyzed and it was found that there was very rarely any difference in confirmation time with or without the priority logic.

I certainly don't propose that. Aside from it being difficult or impossible to do voting securely (as you mention), democracy is in any case one of the worst ways of making decisions. How hard forks should work is that people and businesses should upgrade (or not) as they see fit, without worrying about miners. Miners are then strongly incentivized to follow the fork that is *economically* larger (ie. big businesses are "worth more" than most individuals), though they can still choose whichever fork they want. In practice, nearly everyone will probably upgrade, so it'll mostly be a non-issue for miners.

Bitcoin is not ruled by miners. Miners are and should be irrelevant to hardforks. They're employees of the network, nothing more. If miners break the rules, all full nodes will ignore them, no matter how many miners cooperate. If miners become evil, there will be a hardfork to change the PoW, and a new group of miners will come about.
If miners did rule Bitcoin, then Bitcoin would be a terrible system. You can fit the majority of mining power onto a stage. And there's no reason to think that they have Bitcoin's long-term interests at heart. It'd be worse than the US dollar.
Also, many of them already do express support for certain proposals in their blocks. You don't need a whole new software project for that.

That is completely wrong.
* SegWit will *use* P2SH addresses, so all wallets that support sending to P2SH addresses will *without modification* be able to send to SegWit addresses.
* If you use a SegWit-supporting wallet and you receive a SegWit payment, then you can send these coins to old wallets, and they will be able to accept this payment it without modification.
* If you use an old wallet, it is impossible for anyone to send you a SegWit transaction because your wallet will never produce the specific P2SH-address formulation required for accepting SegWit payments.
When wallets say that they are adding support for SegWit, they mean that they're letting people *accept* SegWit payments (using specially-formulated P2SH addresses) and fully verify SegWit transactions. The stuff listed above requires no special support.

The point of that block number was to show how to make this change with reasonable advance notice, not to suggest a particular block number for doing the change. That post was made on Oct 4, 2010 when the block height was about 83530. Probably how he got block  was that he rounded this to 80000 and added the expected number of blocks in 9 months (~35000). If he was actually suggesting that the change be made at that block number, then he would've had to have actually put this code into Bitcoin very quickly after his post there for his statement "it can start being in versions way ahead" to make any sense at all.

He's talking mainly about full nodes there. He didn't see any difference between full nodes and miners because he didn't anticipate pooling.
I'm not arguing much about Satoshi's position on consolidation or the max block size. He clearly had similar views as Mike Hearn (or the other way around, actually). He thought that the max block size should eventually be increased significantly or completely removed, and that full nodes and miners should become significantly centralized. You'll see this throughout his writing. But this is one of the few areas where Satoshi was completely wrong. It's dangerous to follow the 6-year-old writings of Satoshi as if they were the Bitcoin bible.

Personally, I don't have much of a problem with it. bitcoin.org's DDoS-protected hosting is very expensive, and advertising is a nice consistent way to cover this. The ads are text-only and clearly marked.
I guess if the community ends up absolutely hating it after trying it for a while, then something else should be tried. But *someone* has to pay for hosting.
Some have suggested donations as an alternative, but:
* When there is only one sponsor (or a small number of sponsors), this makes bitcoin.org dependent on the sponsor and creates a perceived conflict of interest. For example, many people *still* think that bitcoin.org is owned by the Bitcoin Foundation because they sponsored bitcoin.org for a long time. (And when there's a banner for the sponsor like there was for the Foundation, isn't that basically an ad anyway?)
* Cobra felt that individual donations would be unlikely to actually cover expenses. (I think that maybe it could be done if people were pushed to donate in some way, maybe through some sort of gamification.)

Witness data is less expensive to the network overall because although all full nodes still need to download full transactions (including witness data) when they are first published, witness data can be quickly discarded, and it's probably safe to choose not to download witness data in extremely old blocks. (Bitcoin Core already doesn't verify signatures in extremely old blocks.) This is why a discount is justified.
I don't know if there's any particular reason for 75%. BlueMatt's hardfork idea (the one discussed in Hong Kong) calls for reducing it to 50% at the same time as a hardfork to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB.

Centralized services can have far lower fees because they're much less expensive to run. Sending a Bitcoin transaction requires thousands of Bitcoin nodes to separately download and verify your transaction, and then for the most powerful computing network in the world to include it in the block chain. A centralized service just has to make a few edits to a database -- each transaction is nearly costless for them.
For off-chain transactions, I envision a federated system. I wouldn't support having just one company handle all Bitcoin off-chain payments. Maybe it'd work like email: You'd sign up for transactionProviderA.com, send microtransactions to bob the two providers would immediately adjust the appropriate balances, and they'd settle up occasionally. Alternatively or additionally, Bitcoin payment channels could be used for the user&lt;-&gt;provider and provider&lt;-&gt; provider transactions so that very little trust is required by anyone.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:46:34
If not paying a fee would cause your transaction to get stuck for a long time, Bitcoin Core will force you to pay a fee even if you have that setting at 0. But if you send a transaction without a fee (as Bitcoin Core is sometimes willing to let you do), the transaction can sometimes be delayed for several hours. Setting the fee to 0.0001 is probably a good idea for most people. Higher fees will occasionally speed up your transactions a little more, but there are diminishing returns, and anything above 0.001 is almost certainly useless.
Also note that this is a fee *per KB*, so some transactions will cost more than the fee you set. Enabling Coin Control in Bitcoin Core's options and then using it when sending a transaction will give you extra info about fees, priority, and transaction sizes.

I wonder if it'd help for some miners to set `blockprioritysize=150000` or something. This sets aside 150 kB of space in blocks where different rules are used for transaction selection. Instead of just choosing the highest fee-per-kB transactions, in this space the highest priority transactions are chosen. This might allow a lot of legitimate transactions which would otherwise be priced out by the spammer.
It's probably also possible to just identify this spammer's transactions and block them directly.

Yeah, it's somewhat better for nodes to be in different locations and on different ISPs. This increases the network's overall decentralization/robustness, and it also allows you to receive more connections (because nodes won't connect to many IPs on the same ISP).

Yes, bandwidth and validation speed of full nodes would be the bottleneck.
The key problem that IBLT etc. are trying to solve is that currently full nodes need to process each block *very quickly* after receiving it. These solutions try to make it possible to spread out the download/upload/verification over the (average) 10 minutes of time between blocks instead of doing it all at once when blocks are received. If IBLT etc. worked *flawlessly*, then theoretically they could allow for blocks about 20 times larger than otherwise, but it's expected that the efficiency will actually be much lower when certain real-world issues are taken into account -- perhaps as low as only 2x. Measurements and more research will be necessary after these solutions are rolled out to determine exactly how much safe scaling they buy us.
After all of the inefficiencies are worked out, then the max block size should grow in step with the global consumer upload speed and typical CPU speed.

They tend to get forgotten by the network over time. But the sender and recipient will keep rebroadcasting it until it gets into a block, refreshing the network's memory. Transactions spending older coins get higher priority, so unless your transaction is extremely rude (eg. 50KB with no fee), it'll probably get confirmed eventually.
You can "cancel" a stuck transaction by sending a new transaction that uses some of the same inputs as the original transaction, but using a larger fee. If the new transaction gets confirmed, then the old transaction will be a double-spend and will surely never be confirmed in the same block chain. The network is somewhat resistant to conflicting transactions like this, but the new transaction will eventually go through if its fee is OK. Cancelling a transaction like this isn't supported by Bitcoin Core yet, though.

In the future, it'll probably always be the case that blocks are nearly full. It doesn't make sense for miners *not* to fill blocks, since they'll collect fees for very little cost. (Computationally, the cost of adding a transaction is very small. There is some additional orphan risk for larger blocks, but technology like IBLT will in the future mostly eliminate this.) The reason that blocks have historically not always been full is that Bitcoin has just been too tiny to fill blocks with fee-paying transactions.
Having full blocks isn't itself a problem -- it just means that you have to pay a fee higher than the cheapest transaction currently getting into blocks. Right now, 0-fee transactions are regularly getting into blocks, so it's not any concern at all. If you had to pay a fee nearer to $0.10 or so, maybe that'd be slightly worrying.
In any case, if we're faced with a choice between lower fees and insecurity/centralization of the Bitcoin currency, clearly larger fees are the correct choice. The block size should never be allowed to get to unsafe levels, no matter how much demand there is. (Ideally, the max block size limit would always be *exactly equal* to the maximum possible safe block size, though it's not known what the maximum possible safe block size is, much less how to find it in a decentralized way.)

People often read "Turing-complete" as "it can pretty much do anything", but "Turing-complete" actually just means that the language can simulate a Turing machine if given infinite resources. Bitcoin's Script can do this. In other words, if Scripts weren't limited in size, you could translate any pure algorithm into Script. But very importantly, Turing-completeness doesn't say anything about the language's input/output capabilities. Scripts can't arbitrarily access the Internet, for example. Also, Script is very space-inefficient (by design). You can write a program in C to calculate pi to the n^th digit, and even if you were using regular C integers n could be pretty large without needing to modify the program. But the equivalent Script program would need to increase in size every time you increase the maximum size of n by 1.

SegWit **is a capacity increase**. People who use SegWit will have lower transaction fees. The most common transaction type  -- a 226-byte transaction with one P2PKH input and two P2PKH outputs -- will instead be counted as being something like 147 bytes, and so it can pay 35% lower fees. The savings are greater for more complicated transaction types such as transactions redeeming P2SH outputs. Furthermore, about 1.8 MB of total block size is expected to be typical (ie. SegWit is expected to be equivalent to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=1.8MB). There is no reasonable way to argue that this is not a capacity increase.
You were pretty enthusiastic about the Hong Kong hardfork proposal. Do you know what this proposal entails? It's to basically do SegWit, and then a year later do a hardfork to clean up some of SegWit's rough edges. The reason that the Core dev participants thought that this could possibly get consensus is that there is essentially no capacity difference between the planned SegWit softfork and the SegWit softfork + this later hardfork: it's something like 1.8 MB vs 2.1 MB in the expected average case. Hailing this hardfork as Bitcoin's savior after panning SegWit is absolutely illogical. But for some reason you and many others have attached yourself to the hardfork idea and won't let go, even though hardfork vs softfork makes no difference capacity-wise. It'd be possible to design a softfork that would increase the effective max block size to even 64 MB for compatible clients, with all of the same benefits and drawbacks as a hardfork to that max block size, but with a much safer rollout.
Hardforks are *extremely dangerous*, and to give them any sort of safety at all requires a very long activation time. Softforks are far safer and less disruptive, and since no activation time is necessary, they can be done much quicker.
@_date: 2016-03-21 04:22:36
IMO it's unlikely that miners will refuse to take a scaling option that's sitting right in front of them.
But if 95% can't be achieved, it's possible to switch to a lower percentage. The downside is that lower numbers (but still above 50%) would make confirmations less reliable for lightweight nodes. For example, due to miners stupidly signaling support for CLTV without actually supporting it, the CLTV softfork actually activated with only something like 60% mining power. This caused some temporary issues, but nothing too terrible.
It's also possible to do a softfork with less than 50% mining power, but then there's a risk of the economy/network splitting. It's sort of halfway between a normal softfork and a hardfork. So the change would need to activate only after a significant delay, like a hardfork. (This is how Satoshi always made changes to Bitcoin's core rules, but it was a lot easier when Bitcoin was smaller.)

You can copy just the "blocks" and "chainstate" directories. They're OS-independent, I'm pretty sure. All of the files here are intimately related and will differ between nodes, so you must copy the files in an all-or-nothing way. If you copy just some of the files, this will totally ruin the database. So on the new OS, you should:
1. Start Bitcoin Core so that it sets everything up and starts syncing. Wait until it's downloaded a few blocks, then shut it down cleanly.
2. Delete its blocks and chainstate directories.
3. Copy over the saved blocks and chainstate directories.
4. Start Bitcoin Core with the -resync option. (Unless your wallet.dat is either empty or exactly the same age as the block database copy.)
db.log is related to wallet.dat, and has nothing to do with the block database. The other *.dat files are self-contained. You can move or delete them and it won't break things.
Note that Core trusts these files absolutely, and if you accept them from an untrusted source, various evil things are possible.
For blocks/blk\*.dat and blocks/rev\*.dat, I *think* it is the case that only the highest-numbered file is ever modified. Also, it is rather rare for Core to access these files except for the few highest-numbered ones, and when it does it usually reads them sequentially. So one trick I do sometimes in order to save space is to move old blk\*.dat and rev\*.dat files to a slower drive, replacing the originals with symlinks.

The RAID 1+0 array containing bitcointalk.org suddenly started getting corrupted. My guess right now is that both of the SSDs in one of the RAID-1 sub-arrays started running out of spare sectors at around the same time. bitcoin.it runs on the same array, and it's been running low on memory for a few weeks, so its use of swap may have been what accelerated the deterioration of these SSD. The SSDs are all exactly the same model.
The database was too corrupted to transfer. bitcointalk.org is currently being restored from a daily backup onto a different RAID array (with different-model SSDs). ~8 hours of data will be lost, though if anything substantial is lost, I may be able to restore it manually from a disk image of the old RAID array that we saved.

I no longer agree with that sentiment. However, I was either talking about some sort of soft policy or I didn't know what I was talking about, since my proposal of enforcing a 500-block maturation time would only help in cases where the two sides of a fork would ever recombine, and this excludes hardforks. I may have been thinking of some sort of softfork, since I mentioned the overflow incident (a softfork).
Anyway, I had known about Bitcoin for less than a year at that point, and Bitcoin itself was very young, so everyone had all sorts of wrong ideas. We were working all of this stuff out from scratch.

SegWit won't initially have a new address format. It'll use the existing P2SH address format (starting with 3) so that it's backward-compatible with ~all wallets.
For a new address format, I'm not sure that there's much value in trying to increase OCR ability. In cases where OCR matters, can't people just use QR codes instead?
For comparing two addresses (or copying them manually, or pronouncing them), IMO it's best to use words in the reader's native language. Then people take the entire word as a symbol, and will quickly notice discrepancies.
Since it wouldn't be fair for English to be the one language of Bitcoin addresses, something that occurred to me was that maybe you could break addresses into pronounceable "words" composed of syllables and sounds that most people in the word are able to pronounce. So an address might be "KyaHaChu MyuJiHa MyuKaKyu ShuFuRu KyaBoZe DaZuRya MeHoRu ByuIKu ZeKuYu" (the capitalization is to help you pronounce it, and is not important). That's only twice as long as a normal address, but far easier to pronounce and copy. (Though since it's more common to copy/paste addresses than to speak them or have to manually copy them, maybe this should just be an alternate option for representing addresses, and not the primary way.)
Keep in mind that future address formats might be longer than current formats. If there is ever a SegWit address format, AFAICT it'll probably encode 32 bytes instead of the current 20 bytes. And I think that addresses for Confidential Transactions need to be quite large, maybe about 100 bytes.

For those who don't know, it seems that Satoshi's intention for Bitcoin's long-term future as of the time of the paper (which was written before Bitcoin even *existed* as a network/currency) was:
* There'd be no pooled mining: the idea hadn't occurred to Satoshi. Mining would be done by large mining farms who would all run their own independent full nodes, but they'd still be pretty decentralized. There'd be maybe several hundred independent mining farms, none with more than a few percent of total mining power.
* Medium-to-large-sized businesses would run their own full nodes for increased security. Maybe there'd be a few thousand of these.
* Everyone else would use SPV nodes, but *with fraud proofs*. The above full nodes would be able to submit a message to the network proving that a particular chain is invalid, and then SPV nodes would drop that chain even though it has more work. Therefore, they'd still be quite secure.
We know now that this fails because:
* There is pooled mining, and even the hardware ownership tends to be pretty centralized due to ASIC-related economies of scale. (Satoshi seems not to have realized just how much better ASICs are compared to GPUs/CPUs.) Therefore, mining is *way* more centralized than Satoshi intended.
* Even the largest Bitcoin-accepting businesses are very often failing to run full nodes, stupidly preferring to rely on centralized APIs because it's a little more convenient at the outset, even though in the long-term they have to deal with [outages, censorship, privacy issues, etc]( Furthermore, the incentives of the system are such that if enough of the economy isn't backed by full nodes, then miners have very little incentive to maintain any of Bitcoin's rules; with no (or very little) check by a full-node-backed economy, rational miners would attempt to break as many rules as they can get away with, as long as it helps them in some way and doesn't *totally, immediately* crash the currency.
* Fraud proofs are known to be impossible under today's Bitcoin network. (This is non-obvious, and was not known during Satoshi's time.) With some modifications to the network, including SegWit, it should be possible to cover the *vast majority* of possible rule violations with fraud proofs that work at least *most* of the time, but it very well might be impossible to cover all rule violations 100% of the time.

No. Sending to a P2SH address is always done in the same way regardless of whether the sender or recipient supports SegWit. But P2SH allows the recipient to enforce various complicated rules such as SegWit without the sender needing to know anything about it.
So if it's a non-SegWit multisig P2SH address, then the recipient doesn't need SegWit. If it's a SegWit multisig P2SH address (which will only be produced by SegWit-compatible wallets), then SegWit is required to spend the BTC but not to send the transaction.

If you're talking about Bitcoin Core, then yes.
When you encrypt a wallet (from unencrypted), Bitcoin Core marks all of the keys in the keypool as bad, and will never give them out. So if you have an unencrypted backup, but later encrypt the wallet and use it for a while, and then restore from the unencrypted backup, usually a large percentage of the BTC in the encrypted wallet will not be in the unenecrypted backup. I don't know whether the same thing happens when you just change the password, though.

That doesn't mean that it's not extremely dangerous/damaging to attempt a "hostile hardfork", nor does it mean that any such hostile hardfork would be equal to Bitcoin at the time of its creation. Hardforks need to be done with consensus.
I also still think that assurance contracts are sufficient for incentivizing mining.
I also still agree that Mike's view matches Satoshi's views in 2010. Satoshi may well have changed his mind in 5 years, though (as I did), and the unknown current opinions of one man are not especially important anyway.
I no longer agree with this part:


I explained my reasoning here (and many other times in many other places):

Storage is already mostly solved, and there are solid ideas for solving the initial sync problem. The main issues are bandwidth and verification time. Full nodes have to download and verify all Bitcoin transactions as they happen. Also, the network needs to provide enough upload capacity for full nodes to be able to download this stuff. So the minimum requirements for a reasonably-safe increase to the effective max block size (MAX_BLOCK_SIZE plus expected witness data) are:
* ~All existing full nodes should have enough download bandwidth that they can download DOWNLOAD_TIMES\*effective_max_block_size in about 30 seconds without experiencing much noticeable congestion, where DOWNLOAD_TIMES is the average number of times that full nodes download a given transaction -- currently slightly higher than 2.
* ~All existing full nodes should have enough CPU power to verify a new worst-case effective-max-size block in about 30 seconds without experiencing much noticeable performance degradation.
* On average, full nodes should have an upload bandwidth sufficient to upload DOWNLOAD_TIMES\*effective_max_block_size\*SPREAD_FACTOR bytes in about 30 seconds without experiencing much noticeable congestion, where SPREAD_FACTOR denotes the average number of times each full node must upload a transaction before everyone who wants it has it. SPREAD_FACTOR depends on how efficiently the network is laid out, how many lightweight nodes there are, and what data lightweight nodes are requesting. It is theoretically as low as 1, but with the current network it's probably unsafe to assume anything less than ~7 (= the number of outbound peers who might not have a newly-received block).
* The UTXO set must not grow so quickly that it creates space issues.
* All of the above must be provided in a decentralized way. It's not reasonable to rely entirely on supernodes that big companies might (theoretically) provide.
The bandwidth issues can be improved in a number of ways, which would, if actually done, allow for larger blocks:
* DOWNOAD_TIMES is ~2 due to the fact that all full nodes actually download each transaction twice: once as a stand-alone transaction and once in a block. This could be significantly reduced with something like IBLT or weak blocks, but it can never reach 1.
* The requirement to download a block in 30 seconds is because the time it takes a block to flow across the network needs to be insignificant compared to the target block time of 10 minutes, or else the network is likely to fall out of sync for long periods of time. Something like IBLT or weak blocks would spread out most of the download so that a full node can download/upload/verify stuff over 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds. However, there are various problems with IBLT / weak blocks still under investigation -- foremost of which is the fact that evil/incompetent miners can create bad blocks that completely remove the benefits of these solutions.
* Natural increases in the world's bandwidth.
* Make the network more efficient to reduce SPREAD_FACTOR.
* Refuse to serve lightweight nodes to reduce SPREAD_FACTOR, or make them pay for the services provided by full nodes in order to subsidize full nodes' increased bandwidth requirements (note that this would likely only subsidize a part of the total requirements).
* SegWit allows for future implementation of fraud proofs. With fraud proofs, it might be reasonably safe for full nodes to verify only a percentage of all transactions that are occurring, and rely on fraud proofs from other full nodes to detect problems in the rest. This is a definite change in Bitcoin's security model, though, so it'd require a lot of thought.
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:53:14
The major problem with these sorts of adaptive proposals is that they consider only what miners think, but *the entire point* of the max block size is for non-miner full nodes to constrain miners. See my post [here](
Also, even though this sort of adaptive blocksize adjustment should not be done, there are far better adaptive blocksize proposals than this one... For example, this one requires miners to actually create larger blocks to vote for them, which means:
* Miners who want larger blocks may have to make fake transactions, wasting space.
* Miners who want smaller blocks have to throw away fee-paying transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:06:08


The transaction fee is the price of transactions, taking into account demand to send transactions and supply of free block space.
It's a fact that the network can only support so many transactions per day while remaining functional and decentralized. That's the maximum supply of transactions. 1MB is surely not exactly the right limit, but exceeding the limit is dangerous, and there is no market force in Bitcoin that would properly set the max block size. This is similar to the maximum number of BTC: automatically adjusting it to try and meet demand is dangerous and probably impossible, and the market can't just create supply endlessly, so we use a fixed currency limit guessed by a human as appropriate (21 million). Unlike the currency limit, the appropriate max block size changes as the world changes, so it should be reset occasionally.
I used to also be worried about how the max block size is seemingly not free-market enough. I am an anarcho-capitalist, after all. But I've thought about it for years, and I've come to the conclusion that a manual max block size is the best we can do.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:06:29
If Bitcoin cannot survive with its current BTC distribution schedule, then Bitcoin should die. The limit is integral to Bitcoin.
The 21 million limit is just an example of this sort of issue, BTW. Another example is that there might be massive popular support for stealing someone's coins (Satoshi's, perhaps). But even if this has 75% economic support or whatever, if it succeeds, it would pretty much disprove the idea that Bitcoin should have any value.

The GUI still works, but it disables wallet-related RPC calls. You can turn this off with the `disablesafemode` option.
The reasoning for this is that automated services should probably stop and check things out if there's a longer invalid chain. It means that either you're being left behind after a consensus hardfork or the majority of miners are evil -- both of which are quite severe events. Probably the message could be more descriptive, though.

That's malleability, not double-spending. The transaction goes through just fine, but it confuses some people/wallets/services because the txid changes. For well-designed things, the new transaction with the new txid should be detected, and should replace the original transaction.
(SegWit fixes malleability, BTW.)

* It's backward-compatible
* Since it's already nearly complete (running *now* on segnet) and it's backward-compatible, it can be deployed more quickly than a hardfork reasonably can. It's predicted that SegWit will be deployed in April. (It's *possible* to do a hardfork more quickly, but very disruptive and dangerous, especially if it could be contentious. Satoshi did a hardfork-like backward-incompatible change with a flag day *two years* in the future.)
* Simply changing 1 MB to 2 MB in the code would cause significant issues. Actually increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE in a reasonable way is pretty complicated. The implementation of BIP 101 in XT was 25% larger than SegWit, for example. SegWit already fixes these issues.
* There's more to scalability than just changing a number. SegWit helps to address some of these things.
* SegWit offers important additional features. For example, it will allow for future deployment of fraud proofs, which will make the network less vulnerable to attacks from a majority of miners. This is especially important now that mining is so centralized.

"Core" doesn't think anything because it's not any sort of unified organization.
In general, the scaling solutions tried by altcoins (aside from the many "solutions" that are pure snake oil) are ideas that were discovered by Bitcoin experts years ago and discarded because they don't actually work, don't work securely, or don't work as well as other known solutions. Altcoins that seem to have better end-user properties scaling-wise are like that mainly because no one uses those altcoins for real-world transactions and because any young cryptocurrency is going to have way fewer historical blocks to deal with compared to Bitcoin.
The most popular altcoins are centralized. Ethereum has a special developer-controlled key which allows them to invalidate any chain they want. Most experts believe that Ripple cannot function unless the list of hubs is shared globally, giving whoever decides this list (ie. Ripple devs) total control. Etc. Such cryptocurrencies don't have to worry about a number of problems that Bitcoin does because the centralized controller of the currency can usually just fix things when they break, though they will have many problems that Bitcoin does not, especially once regulators wise up to this. (And IIRC Ripple had to do some AML stuff?)
If any altcoin actually does come up with some feature making it objectively better than Bitcoin in some way, then this will eventually be added to Bitcoin either directly or as a sidechain. There is no reason for anyone to use anything except the Bitcoin currency unless they think that the Bitcoin currency is flawed (ie. if they think that demurrage would be better).

Script was a big mess. You could steal anyone's bitcoins by simply using the scriptSig `OP_TRUE OP_RETURN`. It was also possible to put a pushdata opcode right at the end of a scriptSig to turn the entire scriptPubKey into a constant (which evaluates to true).
It's suspected that Satoshi didn't really understand hardforks vs softforks in the beginning. Script originally had OP_VER, which was apparently intended for some sort of upgrade system, but which would've resulted in hardforks. But later on Satoshi disabled OP_VER and added the OP_NOP opcodes, which were clearly intended to enable future softforks, and are used for that purpose today.
The original version of the software was quite well-engineered overall. Satoshi definitely put a ton of thought into the design, both at a high level and a low level. But he was figuring this stuff out for the very first time, and he made some mistakes here and there.
@_date: 2016-01-10 08:22:48
For example, the script `2 OP_PICK OP_IF OP_SWAP OP_ENDIF` implements a [Fredkin gate]( which is universal. You can make any circuit (and therefore any computer algorithm) by connecting a number of these gates. Loops are not required for Turing-completeness.

0.12.0 does introduce a (soft, policy) tx-chain-length limit of 25. Probably this is too large to affect spam very much (and anti-spam wasn't the primary goal of the limit). Miners might be able to help against spam attacks by reducing the options `limitancestorcount` and `limitdescendantcount` (in 0.12.0 only), and increasing `blockprioritysize`. Though I don't know which values would be best.

The basic idea has existed for a long time and is widely supported, but there are many details that are still being worked out. I'm not up-to-date on the latest developments.

@_date: 2016-01-15 07:20:49
This sort of idea was popular some time ago, and it's still somewhat accepted as a possible option. Interestingly, it can be done with a softfork. I sometimes hear it called "demurrage", though it's rather different from the traditional meaning of this word. It's not talked about so much nowadays because with pruning, disk space isn't much of an issue right now. (And bandwidth *is* a big issue right now.)
Anyway, probably nothing exactly like this will be done because it's possible to do something better. Basically, full nodes delete very-old unspent transaction outputs (UTXO), but the UTXO remains committed-to in the form of a hash-tree root in block headers, and then when you want to spend this UTXO, you have to provide some extra data. So spending old coins will still be possible, but it'll be a little more expensive. This scheme is called "STXO commitments".

Well it's not so much the name conflict *per se*. More important is that it splits the Bitcoin economy. Also, the usual idea behind these "hostile hardforks" is that they want to get a core base of support and then use it to economically pressure almost all of the remaining Bitcoin economy to abandon the Bitcoin that they signed up for and adopt this new "Bitcoin". This is very bad, and IMO totally against Bitcoin's spirit of individual sovereignty. Also see my post here:

That'd probably wipe out the order books on all exchanges. If they continued trying to buy using market orders, they'd start buying at insane rates like $10,000 per BTC or something as people relatively-slowly get more BTC into the exchange. The BTC price would go up massively, but once all of the USD has been sold, it'd probably massively crash, but to a value significantly higher than what it was before. The exact prices depend on how many bitcoins would be flooding the exchanges to get some of this person's USD and how patient this billionaire is.

If you won't accept the semantic/logical arguments for hostile-hard-fork = altcoin, consider a utilitarian argument:
While it is technically/economically possible for a hardfork to occur even despite controversy, this would mean that some significant chunk of the economy has been disenfranchised: the rules that they originally agreed on have effectively been *broken*, if they want to continue using Bitcoin as they were before. Especially when these controversial hardforks happen despite containing changes that have been rejected by the technical community, or when they happen frequently, how can we say that Bitcoin has any value at all? Even if the hardfork's change doesn't kill Bitcoin, how do we know that a future hare-brained change rejected by the technical community won't? More importantly: what happened to the dream of a currency untouchable by human failings and corruption? How will we know that the bitcoins we own today will be valid tomorrow, when the rules of Bitcoin have no real solidity? Given this, why should anyone ever consider Bitcoin to be a good store of value?
Therefore, I view it as absolutely essential that the Bitcoin community and infrastructure ostracize controversial hardforks. They should not be considered acceptable except maybe in cases of dire need when there is no other way for Bitcoin to survive.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:28:01
Node count doesn't matter very much. The network could still function on a technical level with many fewer nodes.The real problem is that if not enough of the *economy* is backed by independent full nodes, then Bitcoin is totally insecure for everyone (see [here]( and [here](
Larger block sizes make it more expensive to run a full node. In other words, block size is a negative externality suffered by full nodes due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers. That's why full nodes enforce a max block size. (And there's no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- neither has the right incentives.)
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:52:36
If XT's hardfork is activated, then you'll have two incompatible currencies. There's no mechanism in Bitcoin that would ever join these two currencies: they'd be separate forever. XT's hardfork only activates when it has 75% miner approval, but this doesn't imply any particular level of economic adoption, so you could easily have a case where Bitcoin is split evenly in two. But even a 75-25 split would be fracturing Bitcoin in a way that would be deeply harmful.
Original-Bitcoin would be unaffected by these events: Bitcoin full nodes follow the rules *no matter what*. But the separate currency will diverge from Bitcoin permanently. Therefore, whenever there's a non-negligible chance of splitting Bitcoin like this, I consider the software that does the splitting to be an altcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 19:45:07
The network doesn't see any connection between the addresses. If you use an HD wallet, then there actually is a mathematical connection between all of your public and private keys (not including imported keys), but this isn't detectable by third-parties. In a just-a-bunch-of-keys (JBOK) wallet like Bitcoin Core, the addresses are generated from scratch each time you need one, and are totally independent.
If you follow the recommended practice of only ever using an address once (ie. one address per transaction), then it tends to become a lot more difficult to follow your transactions.

In addition to the problem of fake nodes, it's difficult to incentivize the right thing. The main problem is *not* that there might not be enough full nodes for the network to technically function. The main problem is that if most of the economy isn't backed by full nodes, then miners don't have much incentive to follow the rules. I don't know if you can really incentivize people to actually use a full node for their real transactions, which is what we need.

All transactions are recorded in the public block chain. You can look up your address on a block explorer such as  and you should see the transaction. Your wallet is currently downloading and verifying the block chain, and you'll see the transaction once it's downloaded it all. This is a one-time thing, and it's what lets you "be your own bank" and not trust anyone, so it's good to do if you can.

Very few sites go to such lengths.
Security questions are terrible for authentication in general. It's frequently possible for an attacker to find the answers with just a bit of research. I wouldn't use them for anything if I was designing any sort of authentication system.
One of the banks I use does something that I think is decent: When you want to do something sensitive, they'll call you up and ask several obscure questions about you from public records. Then you need to answer quickly. It'd take a lot of dedication for an attacker to perfectly memorize all of the needed info, so this is probably OK for small-value accounts.

I don't think so.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:47:21
If only miners are enforcing that softfork, then that sort of attack is indistinguishable from a 51% attack in which miners refuse to mine any (useful) transactions. The appropriate response would be to hardfork to a new PoW algorithm. Due to the attack, this will be uncontroversial.
For full nodes, softforks are composed of two steps: first miners enforce it, which can't really be prevented in advance, and then full nodes enforce it. When the vast majority of the economy enforces the new rule via upgraded full nodes, then it becomes a hard, immutable rule just like any of Bitcoin's other rules. There's a hypothetical situation in which part of the economy upgrades, but a big chunk refuses to ever upgrade. In the case of a normal softfork, this isn't so much of a problem because for practical purposes all old-style transactions will remain valid, so the two rulesets can easily coexist. But in the sort of softfork you're talking about, sometimes called a "soft-hard fork" or "firm fork", most old transactions become invalid for new nodes, and therefore old users "have to" upgrade. If the change is controversial, then this causes the same sort of economic split as a controversial hardfork. So probably firm forks should never be done, since they require the same amount of consensus as a hardfork for the new ruleset to remain Bitcoin. (The line between a normal softfork and a firm fork is a little fuzzy, but I think that it should normally be clear to pretty much everyone when a softfork will cut out a big chunk of the economy and when it will not.)
In any case, anything with more than 21 million BTC isn't Bitcoin. That's a [prohibited change](

The methodology behind this is that you run some nodes and see who connects *to you*, rather than scanning the network looking for nodes with open ports. This results in many more nodes (because many nodes don't have open ports) and a different distribution, in part because people haven't gotten around to trying to manipulate this yet, and in part because this includes more "normal users" who are just running a full node for personal use.
Full nodes with closed ports *are* still full nodes, and still contribute in the most important way: [by economically rejecting counterfeit BTC](

Having miner agreement makes *softforks* go much more smoothly. In hardforks, miners don't matter. And if miners refuse to go along with a softfork, the same change can always be done with a hardfork instead.
Since miners don't matter in a hardfork, hardforks are rolled out by saying "after &lt;some exact time or block number&gt;, the new rule takes effect". If the time is sufficiently far in the future and the change is not contentious, everyone should naturally upgrade before then.

First of all, note that Bitcoin is composed of two largely-independent pieces: the currency and the transaction system.
The Bitcoin currency is more secure and useful ("programmable") than any fiat currency. Therefore, Bitcoin can be used as an effective store of value, as an alternative to fiat currency and gold... though currently an extremely volatile one. If Bitcoin is still running smoothly in 10+ years and the world loses confidence in the US dollar (due to massive monetary inflation, etc.), it seems plausible to me that Bitcoin could even become the reserve currency of the world.
Also, while the technology isn't there yet, in a few years Bitcoin transactions could be as cheap and easy as credit card transactions. You'd use your smartphone to scan a QR code or receive NFC data, and in seconds your payment would be done (using some payment channel system). This has huge advantages for merchants because:
* There are no barriers. You don't have to sign any agreements, and "being your own bank" provides a ton of flexibility.
* Transactions aren't censored.
* With payment channels, fees will likely be far lower than credit cards.
* Transactions are irreversible.
Consumers would often not have much incentive to use Bitcoin at point-of-sale, so merchants would probably have to pass on some of Bitcoin's benefits in the form of discounts to see much Bitcoin adoption.
There are many use-cases where the above advantages are important enough to make even today's very-inefficient Bitcoin transaction system highly competitive with other transaction systems. This is why the Bitcoin economy has way more than just speculation and hodling.
(Note that almost all of the above advantages are only possible due to Bitcoin's decentralization.)
It *may* be the case that expecting people to not lose their bitcoins is too optimistic. If Bitcoin's main sticking-point is security, then a lot of people could use insured Bitcoin banks, and a reversible transaction layer could be built on top of Bitcoin. These things would remain optional, and since they're built on top of a secure, programmable, decentralized, irreversible currency, these higher layers could still be far more secure than the fiat banking system. But I'm hopeful that sufficient security can be achieved while maintaining essentially all of Bitcoin's decentralization, even for typical end-users -- dedicated Bitcoin hardware on both the merchant and consumer ends will be important for this, I think.
These are all long goals which we will incrementally move toward. Right now, it's true that there is only a small section of the overall world economy that would benefit from Bitcoin's current advantages. But Bitcoin will get better and more useful over time. The things standing in the way of Bitcoin's world domination are mainly technological problems that have yet to be completely solved or implemented, and not so much marketing or business things.

Almost all wallets send transactions with RBF disabled by default, so you probably can't use the opt-in RBF feature introduced in 0.12.0. But the network naturally forgets about 0-conf transactions anyway, so if you stop rebroadcasting the original transaction and keep sending a replacement transaction, it should eventually get through.
I don't know anything about how Mycelium works in particular. Maybe it has some specific tools to delete or cancel transactions. If not, one way to do it in general would be:
* Export the private keys that were needed to send the original transaction
* Import them into a wallet elsewhere (maybe even a different Mycelium installation)
* Send a transaction with a higher fee from there.
* Don't open the original wallet until the replacement goes through, since it might rebroadcast the old 0-conf transaction. If a network node knows about your old transaction, then it won't relay or accept your replacement, so you don't want to remind the network of your old transaction.
* Keep sending the replacement every 4-12 hours until it goes through. You can use the various pushtx services online. Sending it directly to miners such as [Eligius]( might help.
Alternatively, some miners operate with the child-pays-for-parent patch, so if you can get the recipient to spend the coins in the unconfirmed transaction and attach a high fee to the spending transaction, there are miners who will go out of their way to mine the first transaction so that they can collect the fees in the dependent transaction.

@_date: 2017-03-09 20:40:43
Absolutely wrong.
This section of the paper makes no sense if miners define Bitcoin:


run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
[Satoshi]( (my emphasis): 


(Safe mode warns the user, but does **not** follow the longer invalid chain.)




Furthermore, the Bitcoin software has *always* verified and hard-rejected invalid blocks even when not mining. If miners truly were rulers of the network, then there'd be no need for this expensive verification. I described an alternative cryptocurrency design [here]( which *is* ruled by miners, and uses this assumption to significantly increase efficiency over Bitcoin. Why wasn't Bitcoin designed with a design similar to what I described there if it was intended to be ruled by miners?
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:18:12
Obviously both miners (in some cases) and people who make transactions want larger blocks, but the larger blocks are on average, the more expensive it is to run a full node in terms of bandwidth, CPU usage, and disk space. And full nodes do not (and, most experts believe, cannot reasonably) get any reward for supporting increased transaction volume. So in other words, block size is a negative externality suffered by full nodes due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers, and running full nodes is a positive externality provided by full nodes to the benefit of everyone who uses Bitcoin. And there's no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- since it's a common goods problem, neither has the right incentives.
Bitcoin's solution to this issue is for full nodes to enforce a max block size small enough to allow full nodes to operate with a reasonably low cost. Without the limit, the incentives of everyone on the network would be strongly aligned to reduce the number of full nodes as far as possible. It is immediately obvious that this would lead to a small group of centralized full nodes at some point, increasing centralization and therefore decreasing security/robustness. It is less obvious that this situation would *far more quickly* lead to problems because if most of the economy is backed by lightweight nodes, then *miners* don't have any strong incentive to actually enforce the rules of Bitcoin (the 21 million BTC limit, etc.), so all of Bitcoin becomes insecure and worthless.
Bitcoin is a delicate balance of incentives, and the max block size is a very important part of that.
(BTW, experts agree that 2 MB blocks would be safe enough to not cause the above problems, which is why SegWit will increase the effective max block size to ~2MB in a couple months.)
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:26:47
The bandwidth/CPU/storage costs are the same, but orphan/latency issues are worse than increasing the max block size. There's no advantage to reducing the block time. It doesn't even make transactions usefully quicker because even with a 1 minute target time (which is too small to be safe), it wouldn't be all that unlikely for it to randomly still take 10+ minutes for any block to be generated. There aren't many transactions where a few minutes is OK but 10-60 minutes is not; at point-of-sale you really need the transaction done in *seconds*, which is definitely not safely possible with a global block chain.

Ghash.io is alleged to have stolen a lot of money in a Finney Attack (ie. someone accepted 0-conf transactions, but the miner included a conflicting version of this transaction in their next block, which is undetectable until it happens and costless for the miner).

25% of miners can solve several blocks in a row with high probability. If Coinbase wasn't verifying blocks or transactions, but blindly accepting the longest chain, then these miners could work together to send x fake BTC that they created out of thin air to Coinbase, and then once this deposit confirmed immediately withdraw x real BTC.
This can happen even with verification, but it's easier without verification because the attackers don't actually have to have the BTC they're sending to Coinbase.

I've seen almost no serious economic study of any part of Bitcoin, unfortunately.
Full nodes do provide certain network services, and maybe it'd be reasonable for them to somehow charge for these services. For example, lightweight nodes rely on full nodes to filter blocks for them so that the lightweight nodes can easily find their own transactions, and maybe full nodes should charge for this service. Though this may encourage the development of a small handful of huge, cheap full nodes -- centralization is generally more efficient/cost-effective than decentralization, which is something that Bitcoin constantly has to fight against.
This is tangential to the main problem I described, though. Even if full nodes are charging for the services they provide, they are still economically disconnected from the activities of miners and transaction-makers which increase costs on full nodes. Transactions don't *need* to go through the Bitcoin P2P network -- they can be sent and received directly from miners.
The main issue is that the economy needs to have significant leverage/oversight over miners so that if they break the rules, the economy can decisively rejects their blocks. If there were only a few dozen "major" full nodes that almost everyone relied upon, I could easily see most of these full nodes cooperating with miners to break the rules or censor transactions. The only way I know of to ensure that miners are strongly incentivized not to break the rules is for a large chunk of the economy to actually check that blocks aren't breaking them, and absolutely reject them if they are (this is what full nodes do).
Currently, people are incentivized to use full nodes because there is better security (you'll never accept an invalid transaction as valid), it's easier to do certain things if you're a full node, it is probably cheaper than using a third-party API, and there are privacy advantages. But these advantages would be outweighed for increasing numbers of people/businesses if the cost of running a full node became significantly higher.
It is annoying that there are these arbitrary constants in Bitcoin. I actually complained to Satoshi when he added one such limit (the sigop limit). Like many people do today, I had the kneejerk reaction that any fixed limit is a form of central economic planning which is totally inappropriate for Bitcoin. But later I realized that as distasteful as it may be, a few "arbitrary" limits like this are probably necessary. Though hopefully at some point something more flexible and free-market than a constant max block size will be thought up and implemented. There are a few good proposals out there for this (as well as many bad proposals).
On the bright side:
* There a number of huge inefficiencies in the Bitcoin network which, if fixed, would probably allow for a safe max block size of at least 4-8MB. This could successfully happen as soon as next year IMO.
* Lightning, currently in development, seems very promising. Very roughly, Lightning is an attempt to "cache" transaction traffic within localities so that the vast majority of transactions don't actually have to hit the Bitcoin "backbone", somewhat like a (decentralized) CDN. (The "localities" won't just be geographic, though.)
* One thing that can be done is to configure lightweight nodes to be able to accept "fraud proofs" produced by full nodes. These proofs would prove mathematically that a certain block chain is invalid according to the rules of Bitcoin, and then lightweight nodes would reject this invalid chain in favor of the next-longest chain. With fraud proofs, the economy could perhaps retain the ability to decisively reject rule violations by miners with just a small percentage of the economy backed by full nodes. Though for this to be secure, a lot of work would need to be done to ensure than an attacker can't partition lots of lightweight nodes from the fraud-proof-producing full nodes on the network.

Right, but everyone agreed that the new currency became the new Bitcoin, so this didn't cause issues. Serious problems occur only when there's an economic split between two definitions of Bitcoin. As I said:


(Though actually some experts say that the one thing you might call a hardfork wasn't actually a hardfork because the old behavior was non-deterministic -- it was more like old nodes were randomly failing. This is the only possible hardfork in Bitcoin's history.)


This is pretty nonsensical. Firstly, why does a majority of any group automatically have the right to trample over the minority? This idea is common (probably because it is pushed by government schools), but has no basis in reason. Secondly, are you a miner? Does it look like we have one-CPU-per-vote nowadays? Mining is massively centralized.
Miners are and should be irrelevant to hardforks. If miners break the rules, all full nodes will ignore them, no matter how many mines cooperate. If miners become evil, there will be a hardfork to change the PoW, and a new group of miners will come about.
@_date: 2016-03-20 23:52:57
Basically right. Though:
* Bitcoin Core's `estimatefee` is pretty conservative. I usually pay the `estimatefee 25` rate, and my transactions still usually get into one of the next few blocks.
* It's not particularly unlikely for *no* blocks to be solved in an hour, so there's no way to guarantee anything for "the next hour".
I was thinking of making a simple website which would basically just publish my Core node's estimatefee numbers. (I don't like the way that bitcoinfees.21.co handles it.)

Nice analysis.
More and more I've come to believe that voting is the thing that really drags Reddit down. You just can't eliminate all vote manipulation no matter how hard you try, especially when only Reddit's very small team of admins can even begin to look into vote manipulation. There are probably many marketing and political companies/groups which exploit Reddit voting like crazy in order to influence public perception.
Some ideas for replacements to the voting system:
* You could do voting using some sort of web-of-trust system, so each person sees different scores depending on who's in their WoT, and maybe each person's WoT is by default automatically constructed based on the users whose comments they upvote.
* Voting could be completely eliminated, and moderators could curate everything. (As a subreddit option.)
* You could be required to pay for each upvote, increasing the cost of vote manipulation. (There was a cool Bitcoin website called witcoin which did this. The upvote payment was shared with the submitter and early voters, so you could also *make* money with the site.)

Keep in mind that Electrum 1.x produced 12-word seeds and 2.x produces 13-word seeds, and the two seed-generation algorithms are very different. So if you know which Electrum version generated it, you can eliminate some possibilities and also speed up the seed-checking process.

I understand why people do it, but really, people should never use centralized APIs for accepting Bitcoin payments. It's less safe, less robust, and less decentralized. And it's not *that* much more difficult to set up your own full node (though this could still be improved).
@_date: 2016-03-23 01:53:32
Yes, such low times will cause either:
* Massive pressure to centralize; or
* There will be so many reorgs of such length that confirmations will become worthless.
Most altcoins are small and not actually used for any real-world transactions, so they usually don't collapse right away no matter how poorly-designed they are. Though IIRC there have been a few very-low-interval altcoins that did fall apart due to reorg issues.
17 seconds strikes me as extremely unstable. I think that at 1 or 2 minutes you'd hit a point where things will basically always work in practice even though there are still theoretical weaknesses (especially in adversarial conditions). But less than 1 minute is *really* dangerous.

SegWit has many other advantages than just block size. If miners want less than the ~2 MB provided by SegWit, 50% of miners can soft-fork to a lower limit on their own.
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:05:28
I'm not really talking about fees. Some argue for the artificial creation of a fee market by limiting the max block size to significantly below what typical full nodes can actually handle, but I don't think that this will be necessary. The subsidy is sufficient now, and in the future I think that assurance contracts will probably be sufficient to fund miners.
What I'm concerned about is the increasing cost of running a full node. I operate a few Bitcoin Core installations (which are all used actively for transactions), and it's a real hassle. Mainly the disk space, though sometimes also the bandwidth or heavy disk/CPU usage during syncing. Disk space will be improved a lot with 0.12's pruning. With this pruning plus libsecp256k1, 2 MB seems OK, which is why there is consensus for SegWit's effective max block size increase to 2 MB. Though 2 MB will probably still be more difficult than 1 MB blocks, especially if you want to maintain an "archival" node (which is extremely useful, especially for businesses and power users, since it allows you to rescan fairly quickly). Going much beyond 2 MB starts to get into dangerous territory again, especially bandwidth-wise.
The limit of safety is fuzzy, but that doesn't mean that we should do things that are clearly very far in the wrong direction. Already, the economy is too centralized. Many businesses don't run their own full nodes, relying instead on third-party APIs like BitPay, even though they want to receive BTC (not a local currency). Many people who run wallet software on desktop computers use SPV wallets. These are both very big problems, and while resource usage is not the only obstacle to full node adoption, I have little doubt that moving to (say) 4 MB today would drastically increase the problem due to the massively increased hassle of running a full node.
Adoption alone won't help much. A big part of the problem is that normal everyday people aren't running full nodes. They're not going to be receiving any investor money. And while more Bitcoin users will (maybe) increase the absolute number of full nodes, this is meaningless if the percentage of the economy backed by full nodes goes down. Also, businesses will almost always prefer to deal with increasing full-node costs by not running a full node and instead relying on a third-party API; centralization is way more efficient that decentralization, so businesses generally prefer it.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:54:58
The underlying problem is that we need everyone (or at least the vast majority of people) to have the exact same view of the system's current state. If someone shares his private key with another person on the other side of the planet, and they conspire to spend the same coins at the exact same time, then roughly half of all nodes will see one transaction and half of all nodes will see the other transaction. If both transactions are allowed, then this person has just doubled his money, defrauding everyone holding the currency. But if the nodes don't ever agree, then the currency permanently splits in two at this point: one side views transactionA's coins as illegitimate, and the other side views transactionB's output coins as illegitimate; as these confused coins get mixed with other coins, it will eventually become impossible for the two sides of the network to transact at all, since most coins will be sourced from ancestor coins that one side or the other considers invalid. (For somewhat more complicated reasons, it's also not reasonably possible to reject both versions of a conflicting transaction when a conflict is detected.)
The point of mining is to make the network eventually converge onto one global view of which conflicting transactions are to be considered valid. In the above example, only one of the transactions will get mined and get many confirmations. In rare cases both transactions could get a few confirmations, but the random nature of mining makes it so that the probability of a long mining fork (not a *consensus* fork) approaches 0 as you consider longer and longer forks.
If somehow "the economy" could pick transactions instead, then there'd be no need for mining. It's sort of difficult to imagine, but I guess here's an example of how this could theoretically work: *Whenever a node sees a conflicting transaction on the wire or in a block, it asks the user which version of the transaction is correct. In all such cases, each Bitcoin user very quickly responds to this question, and essentially the entire economy just happens to select the same transaction, both at the time of the conflict and whenever new nodes are syncing.* Clearly this isn't practical.
You may be thinking now that voting could be used. But it is **not** true that "a majority of GROUP votes to do something" equals "GROUP agrees to do something". That's a usually-slim majority forcing its will onto a minority, which is not what is contemplated by the UASF proposal, nor what Bitcoin is about generally. (Also, there's no way to do one-person-one-vote here.)
So the bottom line is that something like UASF is possible only with a lot of time and coordination because by its very nature it inherently requires manual action from nearly everyone running a full node. It can't be done for every transaction.
You could do *other* things to replace mining, but then you're not talking about something similar to the UASF proposal. Various altcoins have done pure-PoS mining, PoS-elected notaries, centralized checkpoints, etc., which are all ways of agreeing upon a single global state without PoW miners, though these are all terrible ideas for other reasons.
The old Ripple concept (largely unrelated to today's Ripple) was an example of a decentralized cryptocurrency without mining. How it worked was that each user would manually say, "I'm willing to loan Alice x tokens, Bob y tokens, Carol z tokens, ...". Everyone would do this, forming a trust network. Then, assuming the trust graph was globally connected, you could send money by sending an IOU to someone who trusts you, who would send an IOU to someone who trusts them, and so on over multiple steps until the recipient receives an IOU from someone who they trust, completing the transfer. This could be done with a new currency or (probably more usefully) with an underlying asset such as BTC or gold which could occasionally be used to actually settle the Ripple loans, though settlement would only rarely be necessary. The reason that this idea doesn't require mining is that it is able to function without a single global view of anything; each person is only concerned with his own loans and trust. The downside of this system is that it is possible for the trust graph to not be connected, in which case some transactions would be impossible, and it is also possible for people to assign trust *incorrectly* and lose money from defaulted Ripple loans.
Another point is that it is not strictly required for miners to verify anything. Requiring that all transactions within blocks be valid allows for several very important optimizations, but if miners could include whatever nonsense data they wanted, then Bitcoin could still function. However, everyone would then have to run a full node in order to separate the real transaction data from the garbage. In Bitcoin, lightweight nodes are possible because the full-node-backed economy will reject blocks containing invalid transactions, giving miners a strong incentive not to include invalid transactions or build off of invalid blocks, making it sorta-kinda safe to assume that sufficient-difficulty blocks contain no invalid transactions. (If there were no full nodes, then miners would *not* have any particularly incentive to avoid including invalid transactions, only a substantially weaker incentive to avoid doing so much harm to Bitcoin that they'd damage their potential to profit from mining.)

Someone would release "Bitcoin ST" (like Bitcoin XT) which would allow miners to freely spend so many of Satoshi's coins per block or something like that. Maybe this would be marketed as: "The block subsidy is clearly insufficient to support miners, and we don't want to pay higher fees. So why don't we just take Satoshi's? He's not using them, and is it really fair for him to have so many coins anyway?" Maybe this sounds a little far-fetched now, but I could definitely see it getting popular support someday.

SegWit has a multiplying effect on the effective max block size. The current proposal is roughly `effective_max = MAX_BLOCK_SIZE*2` for the current transaction distribution, and up to `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE*4` for the (unrealistic except in an attack) worst-case. So with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=1MB SegWit gives an effective max block size somewhere in the range of 2MB - 4 MB, but with MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB SegWit gives an effective max block size somewhere in the range of 4MB - 8MB: a significant jump.
The effective max block size has all of the issues (bandwidth, storage space, latency, etc.) and benefits (tx capacity) as increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.

Looks correct to me except that there was no need to send extra money to the address first. You could've just redeemed his one 0.7 BTC output and sent 0.6975 BTC. I suppose you were thinking that you needed some credit in the address before attempting this, but that's not a correct way of thinking about Bitcoin transactions. The Bitcoin system has no concept of address balances, so sending the 0.005 BTC to 14ZiR and then redeeming this output in the same transaction as the stuck output is entirely indistinguishable from paying 0.005 BTC to some arbitrary other address of yours instead - it's pointless and actually increases total fees.
Your fee is about what I would try at first. I think that maybe you could've gotten away with a somewhat smaller fee, but the fee does need to be higher than normal because you're really paying for two transactions instead of just one.
I'm surprised that it was confirmed so quickly. Maybe there are more miners running with CPFP than I thought.

I still tend to think that the rule change will be rejected, though I'm not confident enough to bet/trade on it.

If it's rejected, I think that the price will drop sub-$1000, but within two weeks recover some of its lost value to bring it above $1000 again.

The main problems with that are:
* Almost everyone will just use the defaults. Anyone who doesn't use the defaults will be acting alone, and will therefore be economically insignificant and ignored by miners. So the only thing that would actually matter would be the defaults and maybe what a few very large players do.
* Node counting is a very unreliable method of determining anything.
* You're going to have frequent small-scale fragmentations of the network/currency. It's unclear how stable this would be.
In 2015 I [proposed something similar]( which addresses the first two of those problems, though I still think that it's more messy and less safe than a global max block size.

Exchanges alone aren't sufficient. If all of the big exchanges commit to supporting the UASF, then it is *very likely* that miners will follow along, since otherwise they won't be readily able to sell their mined coins, but this is not guaranteed. If miners do not follow along, then everyone using old code (*including* all current Bitcoin Core versions) will follow the miners, not the economy. The network/currency would badly split in this case, which would be a disaster.
The time needs to be sufficient for pretty much all full nodes to upgrade naturally as part of their usual software updating.

That idea did occur to me, but I'm not sure whether I can write a statement that they wouldn't feel too constrained by. I don't have much experience dealing with big companies.
The basic idea would be: "We currently will not accept any blocks or transactions that Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 would reject as invalid. If we change this, we will give at least 30 days advance notice to our customers." Note that since an exact version is given, this does not give centralized control to Bitcoin Core -- Core is just used as a convenient reference.
A better statement, which would set a great example for similar companies, would be something like: "We currently will not accept any blocks or transactions that Bitcoin Core 0.11.2 would reject as invalid. We promise never to change this unless EITHER there is no significant technical or economic opposition to the change [probably this needs more exact language] OR each of our customers will have to explicitly choose between the old ruleset and the new ruleset." This is probably not perfect -- in particular, maybe "firm forks" need to be disallowed here.
If Coinbase is interested in this, I could get a bunch of experts together to figure out something that's both good and not too constraining. There are many experts who'd be willing to help, I think -- Coinbase's ambiguity here has been a major concern to everyone.


Ideally no one would use these Bitcoin banks, but I think that especially in the current environment where there is no great wallet software, Bitcoin banks might be inevitable.

Probably how it should work is that things with `collapsed-for-reason` should have reversed CSS for `collapsed` and `noncollapsed`, and then probably some fixup is necessary for their child comments which will be affected by this.

Agreed. I think that eventually we will have a Bitcoin user experience far *better* and freer than today, and hopefully it will always be possible for anyone to fairly cheaply use the block chain, but the most important thing is for Bitcoin to remain a decentralized, secure, smart store of value. If that requires treating bitcoins like [Yap stones]( that's still better than what we had before Bitcoin. (Ironically, Gavin used to compare BTC to Yap stones in his 2011 interviews.)

I'm not sure. What you're saying is obvious to me now, but not then (when I was ~18 years old), and I don't remember anyone ever mentioning ASICs before ArtForz created the first ones. Satoshi mentioned GPUs as possibly displacing CPUs at some point. Maybe the (very few) people who knew about this stuff at the time assumed that ASICs would not be a huge leap up from GPUs, which would not be a huge leap up from CPUs.

I have serious doubts about the usefulness of SPV-security sidechains due to their significantly reduced security, but if they're pegged to BTC, then they'd be on-topic IMO.
Where it enters a grey area is if you have a sidechain (or other off-chain system) that does something weird to the currency. For example, a sidechain might have rules like:
* You can convert via the 2-way-peg process 1 BTC into 1 sidechain-coin.
* You can convert via the 2-way-peg process 0.5 sidechain-coin into 1 BTC.
* You can also mine sidechain-coins directly, without needing any BTC.
This sort of thing is possible with sidechains, and although BTC is still strongly involved in this example, it seems to me that the other rules end up resulting in an altcoin rather than a BTC-denominated asset.

You're focusing mostly on miners, but the more important question is what regular users will accept. If Coinbase accepts one limit and Circle accepts another, and if a block is thereby only accepted by one of them, then those two companies will now forever be dealing in two different currencies until one of them manually fixes it. (Unless you're assuming various other things that aren't true today.) For example, due to a bug, pre-0.8 nodes sometimes had an actual max block size that was somewhat less than 1 MB. When 0.8 accidentally fixed this bug and simultaneously started creating such large blocks, the network split, and this had to be fixed manually in an emergency change to 0.8.

Block data is written to the `blocks/` files in the order that blocks are received. But when you're syncing from several peers, you'll receive blocks in an arbitrary order. Also, when a longer chain surpasses a shorter one, the shorter one's data is never deleted from the `blocks/` files. So especially for long-running nodes, these files can be very different.
The `chainstate/` files contain references to transaction data like, "blk00000.dat, byte offset 1234", so these files differ for the same reason.


There are many other rules of Bitcoin than just "longest chain wins". Bitcoin uses the longest *valid* chain. Checking all of these rules at startup for all blocks in the database would take hours each time. (You can force Core to verify its entire block database with the -checkblocks=0 flag, though last I checked this doesn't actually verify the blocks completely, and some evil might still be possible.)

They're all about equally likely IMO.
One of the more likely ways for Lightning to fail is for huge hubs to arise and dominate, and for Lightning to devolve into essentially a hub-and-spoke system.
If Lightning doesn't become substantially usable before it's needed, blinded bearer certificates are fairly easy to implement and don't require much infrastructure. People have already done it with Bitcoin in the past. So especially if there's a high-tx-fee emergency, this is something that could become popular very quickly.
Definitely in the case of blinded bearer certs, and maybe in the case of Lightning/hub-and-spoke, there could be legal issues due to the intermediary possibly being a "money transmitter". The sidechain approach avoids this, so it might be preferred despite being probably slower and less secure overall.

* They have better physical security. That is, it'll be more difficult for someone with access to the device to attach a hardware keylogger, etc. (Though the hardware wallet manufacturers overstate their hardware security, I think.)
* Although very difficult, it's still slightly possible for someone to attack your offline computer via software. For example, even air-gapped computers can be attacked by exploiting the USB flash drives used to transfer data to/from such computers. An attacker could modify any scripts/programs on the flash drive to attack the air-gapped computer, or could theoretically even exploit a bug in the USB-flash-drive kernel driver on the air-gapped computer. Etc. Dedicated hardware wallets probably have less surface-area for such attacks. (And if you plan on using Tails on an *Internet-connected* computer, then its exposure to software attacks is significant.)

"Priority" in Bitcoin is a specific function defined as the number of bitcoin-days destroyed by the transaction divided by its size in bytes. It's a good anti-spam measure because typical people usually have coins that are at least a few days old that they can spend, but spammers quickly end up with only a bunch of very new coins, which have low priority.


I meant that *miners* should block them. If even one miner is blocking them, then that leaves more space for real transactions.

I haven't seen any analysis of the actual attack that was done, but in general: To make it impossible for anyone to get a transaction through with a fee less than $x per kB, an attacker needs to pay roughly 1000 kB * $x per block. So to raise the required fee to $1/kB requires $1000 in fees per block.
Ideally, wallets should notice this and say, "There's a spam attack going on. You can either pay this above-average fee to outbid the attacker or you can wait a while." Also, wallets should support RBF and/or CPFP to allow people to adjust fees after transaction creation. But in reality, most wallets just pay some constant fee, which is what caused most of the trouble in this case. (Bitcoin Core has a fee estimator, though it doesn't warn about spam attacks specifically, and it doesn't yet allow adjusting fees easily.)
If the max block size is doubled, then the cost to raise the required fee to a certain level is also roughly doubled. So when SegWit increases the effective max block size to ~2 MB around April, this attack will become more expensive. But if wallets use a fixed fee, then it still won't require all that much money to fill blocks with slightly-above-average fees. Fee estimation is required in any case.
Furthermore, I've seen a number of people saying stuff like, "If there's an attack, then the max block size should be able to increase arbitrarily to absorb it." This is a very misinformed statement. Obviously both miners (in some cases) and people who make transactions want larger blocks, but the larger blocks are on average, the more expensive it is to run a full node in terms of bandwidth, CPU usage, and disk space. And full nodes do not (and, most experts believe, cannot reasonably) get any reward for supporting increased transaction volume. So in other words, block size is a negative externality suffered by full nodes due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers, and running full nodes is a positive externality provided by full nodes to the benefit of everyone who uses Bitcoin (Bitcoin is absolutely insecure if not enough of the economy is backed by full nodes). And there's no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- since it's a common goods problem, neither has the right incentives. Bitcoin's solution to this issue is for full nodes to enforce a max block size small enough to allow full nodes to operate with a reasonably low cost. Removing the limit would make spam attacks even worse, since spammers would be able to directly attack Bitcoin's volunteer full nodes (and therefore Bitcoin's *decentralization*) rather than just increase fees temporarily.

You can't increase the limit from the perspective of un-upgraded nodes with a softfork. A softfork could be designed which retains compatibility with old nodes while increasing the limit from the perspective of upgraded nodes, with some rules for moving coins between them.

No one is forced into SegWit. You could use an old node forever and it'd still work, including verification of all of the rules it cares about. Nothing about Bitcoin is broken by SegWit.
It's OK to promote the idea of not running SegWit-compatible wallets, or to promoting some other competing or concurrent softfork. The apparent lack of choice is because almost everyone supports SegWit, and those that don't tend to be fixated on hardforks for some reason.


Miners are irrelevant, and they should not have any power over Bitcoin.

The way that SegWit works offers a one-time opportunity to do a limited extension block softfork *without* the issue of new-to-old transactions because SegWit needs to create a new area for witness data, and old nodes just happen to behave in a very clean/useful way when the current witness data is moved to the new segregated witness area. The same thing can't be done again.
In general, I think that method 2 would not be *extremely* difficult to implement at the level of full nodes (as a guess, maybe it'd be about the same difficulty as SegWit), but some pretty extensive changes would be necessary at the wallet level. For example, if you have only old UTXOs and you want to send to a new address, this'd require a two-step transaction process.

A Bitcoin address *defines* the scriptPubKey used in transactions to that address. A transaction to a normal address starting with 1 **always** has and necessarily must have a scriptPubKey of exactly `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash in address&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`. If you use any other script, even one that sends to the same pubKeyHash or pubKey, then you are *not* sending to that address; the recipient's wallet almost certainly won't recognize it as an incoming transaction, and the owner of the address has no obligation to acknowledge the transaction.
So there's no way to make a transaction appear (from the perspective of any non-broken wallet) to be sent to some address but then actually not be spendable as expected. Adding additional constraints changes the scriptPubKey, which results in a different address (or no address: there are scriptPubKeys with no corresponding address).

I think that all companies which handle both deposits and withdrawals should say on the deposit page something like: "This is being credited as a deposit according to Bitcoin Core version 0.14 with source-code hash ____," replacing the software with whatever you're actually using. You need to identify an *exact* piece of software, not just "Bitcoin Core", hence the hash. Then when someone makes a deposit at a time when that declaration was active, when they later withdraw, you must *at least* pay them with a transaction that the software version you listed at the time of deposit will see as valid. In case of a consensus split, you should additionally send or credit them any other currency that their specific deposit generated, if this has significant value and if it's reasonably possible for you to do so.
If you don't make a declaration like that, then it becomes messy because you have to consider what the depositor *expected* he'd be able to withdraw. You couldn't just replace someone's BTC with Clams just because BTC is automatically convertible to Clams. You also couldn't make up your own softfork used by ~nobody else saying "block  hash must end with 0x00" and use it to treat coins mined on a shorter valid chain as real BTC. Those particular examples are extreme, but actually-tricky cases are not impossible in reality. If the depositor runs Bitcoin Core, then he's going to legitimately view it as fraud if you replace his BTC with BTU. If BIP148 largely fails economically, but the depositor is part of a small minority running a modified version of Bitcoin Core with BIP148, maybe he'd view it as fraud if you replaced his deposited coins with coins seen as valid by Bitcoin Core but invalid according to BIP148.
In reality, most sites aren't going to make a declaration like that. In such cases, these default expectations seem reasonable to me:
* Deposits pre-fork must at least be returned as coins valid according to pre-fork Bitcoin Core.
* If the forkcoins have any substantial value, the forkcoins generated by the deposit should also be returned if reasonably possible.
* If a majority of the Bitcoin economy clearly does not enforce a UASF, then its restrictions need not be respected/considered, as tracking minority UASFs would be unreasonably difficult.
* In the unlikely event that a PoW change is necessary due to miner attacks, original BTC (pre-PoW-change, pre-fork) should be returned in a valid transaction if any depositors so request within a reasonable timeframe, even if the transaction seems very unlikely to ever be confirmed. You are not responsible for the failure of the transaction to confirm as long as it is valid. If the miner attacks rewrite history enough to wipe out coins such that you are unable to return them due to no fault of your own, then you should treat this as a default of the Bitcoin system, and should probably proportionally reduce everyone's credited original-BTC before sending out the unlikely-to-ever-confirm transactions. Everyone's pre-incident BTC balance should be converted to the amount of BTC as seen by the version of Bitcoin Core implementing the PoW change, plus optionally any forkcoins.
* Pre-fork deposits should be credited entirely. But if someone sends you a replayable transaction or unsupported forkcoins post-fork, this is like sending BTC to the wrong address, and while you should return the extra if practical, it is not required.

Signatures are verified for a large part of the initial sync. It's only really old transactions before the last checkpoint in which signature verification is skipped. Since checkpoints are hard-coded, they make it impossible for anyone to tamper with anything in blocks before the last checkpoint, including signatures.
Things beside signatures which are checked include rules like:
* Transactions can only spend unspent coins.
* Miners can only create so much BTC.
* Blocks have to have a somewhat-accurate timestamp, correct Merkle root, correct block height, etc.
* The block must actually meet the difficulty requirements. 
* Various limits: max sigops per block, max block size, at least one input per transaction, etc.
* Non-signature parts of Scripts must validate for all transactions.
Also, while downloading blocks, Bitcoin Core spends a lot of time putting the data into a fast and small database for later. The whole block database is ~80 GB, but the database that Bitcoin Core actually *uses* in normal operation (in the chainstate directory) is only ~2 GB.

Miners have a separate [relay network]( amongst themselves. They don't need to depend on the Bitcoin network for relay. They'll just create a long chain and eventually it'll get pushed through the Bitcoin network *unless* it is hard-rejected. Permanently hard-rejecting blocks is the only tool that nodes really have.
Also, if a node accepts a block but refuses to relay it, then this doesn't make a lot of sense. It's saying, "I hope and predict that this block won't actually last, but I'll accept it as adding confirmations to transactions and work to the longest chain anyway."
Another problem is that if you have to manually set the limit, then almost everyone is just going to use the defaults. The ones who don't use the defaults will be a tiny economic minority. And even if the limits are automatically assigned somehow, if the limits are fairly evenly spread across the number line, then people will tend to fall off the network one-by-one as miners slowly increase their block sizes, and at no point will there be an effective economic resistance against an increase.
One idea (based on [my old per-node limit idea]( with some additional ideas by aminok) would be for miners to *propose* a specific new max block size, and if a particular proposal gets x% of miner support, then full nodes would automatically show a GUI making each user of a full node choose to accept or reject this proposal. After a "voting period", miners would choose to go forward with the proposal and split permanently from people who said no, or abandon the proposal. Since the "vote" happens at the same time for everyone, it ensures that any economic resistance will be strong. (Note that the point of giving miners a say here is just to attain coordination. In general, miners do not and should not have any particular decision-making power in these sorts of issues.) It is vitally important that the client make a recommendation here using automatically-computed information about the computer's technical capabilities, or else we'd get nearly a 50-50 split every time, which would be an absolute disaster. There would need to be some infrastructure for people (especially businesses) to gauge the economy's support here. One good method would be for people to send the constants going into the limit recommendation algorithm every time they buy something with the payment protocol so that businesses can predict which currency their clients will use whenever there is a limit-increase proposal.
With this idea, even with the mechanisms intended to reduce it, at every increase there would be some split in the economy, which would be pretty awful. And to get it all working properly would require quite a bit of thought and code. So I still think that a global max block size is preferable, though I do think that the above idea *could* be made to work. (Of course, consensus would be necessary before Bitcoin could adopt something like this.)

While it is technically/economically possible for a hardfork to succeed even despite controversy, this would mean that some significant chunk of the economy has been disenfranchised: the rules that they originally agreed on have effectively been *broken*, if they want to continue using Bitcoin as they were before. What happened to the dream of a currency untouchable by human failings and corruption? How will we know that the bitcoins we own today will be valid tomorrow, when the rules of Bitcoin have no real solidity? The 21 million BTC limit is technically just as flexible as the max block size; given this, why should anyone ever consider Bitcoin to be a good store of value if these rules are changeable even despite significant opposition?
Especially if these controversial hardforks succeed despite containing changes that have been rejected by the technical community, or if they happen frequently, I can't see Bitcoin surviving. How would anyone be able to honestly say that Bitcoin has any value at all in these circumstances?
Therefore, I view it as absolutely essential that the Bitcoin community and infrastructure ostracize controversial hardforks. They should not be considered acceptable except maybe in cases of dire need when there is no other way for Bitcoin to survive. It's impossible to technically prevent contentious hardforks from being attempted or even succeeding, but that doesn't mean that we need to view them as *acceptable* or let them use our websites for promotion.
Also, I feel like it's pretty clear that the 50BTC-forever fork *was not Bitcoin* by any reasonable definition, since Bitcoin has no more than 21 million BTC, so I disagree with your proposed classification scheme for that reason as well.

LOL, if that's actually his thinking (which it might not be), then he likely doesn't want to increase block sizes much anyway. He probably likes the current fee rates.
Anyway, the entire way he's thinking is wrong:
* Lightning is totally possible without SegWit, it's just less efficient, and annoying because the current Lightning implementations were written assuming SegWit.
* Off-chain stuff is possible (and inevitable) with or without Lightning. See my posts on [federated sidechains]( and [blinded bearer certificates]( two alternate methods of off-chain transactions which don't require softforks. Lightning is just better than those in most ways, and ironically the one that would result in the highest miner fees.
* In a world where Lightning was the main method of conducting BTC transactions, how it'd work is that every Bitcoin user would pay a tiny per-transaction fee to Lightning nodes and a few larger fees to miners every year for on-chain channel open/close transactions. You can imagine it like every Bitcoin user paying an annual subscription fee to miners rather than a per-transaction fee. This has the potential to lead to much higher total fees for miners, since you can charge more for the subscription than you can get from on-chain fees. For example, even with 1 MB blocks, it's plausible to charge 10 million people an annual $10 fee for the on-chain transactions necessary for their unlimited Lightning transactions, but is it really plausible that you can get enough on-chain transactions with high enough fees to get an equivalent revenue in on-chain fees? I really doubt it. If you averaged $0.01 in fees per transaction, you'd need to both *attract and survive* about 15% of Visa's total transaction volume in order to match the revenue of the 10 million people @ $10/year Lightning example. The "survive" part of that is almost certainly impossible right now, and "attract" is dubious when microtransactions are excluded due to the higher-than-Lightning per-transaction fees and when Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies are always going to be much worse transaction systems than centralized things like Visa (confirmation delays, etc.).
* Miners are employees of the network; they don't get to dictate terms. If they don't do their job, they will be replaced.

Yes. I think that his original idea was that basically *everything* would be done via the Bitcoin client: Auctions, currency exchange, reputation, escrow, etc. This is part of why the client started out as GUI-only: he was thinking that there would be *no need* for anyone to access Bitcoin programmatically, since everything would be done by end-users via the client. But eventually he realized that these are all very difficult and different problems in their own right, and so he gave up and added the JSON-RPC interface for websites to use (in 0.2.6, well after the initial release).

SegWit-enabled outputs are just P2SH outputs. So if your wallet supports SegWit, then all of your addresses will be P2SH addresses (starting with 3). Almost all wallets can already send to P2SH addresses. P2SH allows the sender to be ignorant about how the BTC will end up being secured by the recipient.
If your wallet doesn't support SegWit, then your wallet will never give you a P2SH address compatible with SegWit, so it will be impossible for anyone to send you a payment which would require you to support SegWit.

Also, it's been speculated that much of this was just people unfamiliar with the bandwidth cost of running a full node, since XT was the first full node they ever ran...
Edit: I'm not saying that this was always the case, but I can easily see people hearing about DDoS attacks, running XT, and then attributing all of the bandwidth (and maybe disk/CPU) problems to a DDoS when it's just the normal cost of running a full node (with *1 MB* blocks).

SegWit fixes malleability only for transactions with all-SegWit inputs. Any non-SegWit inputs are "legacy", and transactions containing legacy inputs can still be malleated. SegWit is bundled with the [BIP 147]( NULLDUMMY softfork which prevents one type of malleability on legacy inputs. [BIP 146]( describes two more softforks for preventing malleability on legacy inputs. The LOW_S part of BIP 146 was originally going to be bundled with SegWit, but some last-minute issues were found and it was delayed. LOW_S would've prevented the malleability used by BitClub.
Note that although there have been previous softforks to address specific malleability attacks on legacy transactions, and there will be more in the future (see BIPs [62]( [66]( 146, and 147), these only work for "typical" transactions, and only for known malleability attacks. More esoteric scripts could still be malleated in some cases, and there may be more malleability attacks still unknown. SegWit solves malleability *in general* rather than addressing specific cases.

How long it'd take to guess 24 random words depends on how many different possible words there are. It's easier if there are 1000 possibilities per word than if there are 10,000 possibilities per word, for example. Also, some of those words might be used as part of a checksum (to check that you entered the other words correctly), and checksum words don't contribute to security.
However, as far as I know, all wallets that use mnemonics choose their dictionary size and mnemonic length so that there are at least 2^128 possible mnemonics. At that point it'd be easier for an attacker to skip the mnemonic and attack ECDSA itself, since Bitcoin's secp256k1 ECDSA curve has security equivalent to a perfect system with 2^128 possible private keys. (We say that both of these systems have 128 *bits of security*.)

Luke runs one of the DNS seeds, but that can't be directly used for collecting stats because people hardly ever connect directly to DNS servers -- usually you do DNS queries via an intermediary, and the intermediary also does a lot of caching.

It'll be possible to pay to SW using P2SH addresses supported by ~all wallets. Receiving SW payments will require wallet support, but [many wallets]( have already pledged to support it. It is impossible for someone to pay you via SW if you don't support it.
So once your wallet supports SW, it'll start giving you addresses starting with 3 rather than 1. Everyone will be able to pay to these normally. But when you go to spend these received coins, you'll be able to use SW, and your non-witness tx size (and therefore fees) will be roughly halved on average.

Old coins should be destroyed before they are stolen to prevent disastrous monetary inflation. People joined Bitcoin with the understanding that coins would be permanently lost at some low rate, leading to long-term monetary deflation. Allowing lost coins to be recovered violates this assumption, and is a systemic security issue.
So if we somehow learn that people will be able to start breaking ECDSA-protected addresses in 5 years, two softforks should be rolled out now:
* One softfork, which would activate ASAP, would assign an OP_NOP to OP_LAMPORT (or whatever QC-resistant crypto will be used). Everyone would be urged to send all of their bitcoins to new OP_LAMPORT-protected addresses.
* One softfork set to trigger in 5 years would convert OP_CHECKSIG to OP_RETURN, destroying all coins protected by OP_CHECKSIG. People would have until then to move their BTC to secure addresses. Anyone who fails to do so would almost certainly have lost their money due to the ECDSA failure anyway -- the number of people who lose *additional* BTC would be very low.

I think that either of them could be implemented pretty quickly. They don't require any changes to Bitcoin, so theoretically one person could do it in a matter of weeks if he worked on it constantly. I've long wished that someone would create something quick and dirty like this, since although Lightning is basically working on testnet, it might take a long time before it's really a generally-usable solution, and there's a need for Bitcoin micropayments and instant confirmations *now* (which on-chain transactions are *never* going to fill).
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:23:37
If Lightning doesn't work out, there are other options for small/fast payments:
* You can do a more centralized but simpler version of something like Lightning where everyone opens usually just one very-long-duration payment channel with a single hub, and then all of the hubs route payments between each other. This is called the "hub-and-spoke" idea, and there's apparently already some code for it in the form of StrawPay/stroem.
* Bitcoin banks could issue blinded bearer certificates. This is how many cryptocurrency proposals worked before Satoshi invented the block chain. When *combined* with Bitcoin, these certificates can be far more transparent (banks can prove full reserve, for example) and secure (using multisig). They also have the advantage of providing significant anonymity.
* A sidechain could be specially-designed for high throughput and low confirmation times. This sidechain would have reduced security and probably various other limitations, but it'd be fine for small amounts.
Lightning is what everyone is striving for because it has all of the advantages without most of the drawbacks, whereas the above solutions have reduced decentralization or security. But if for whatever reason Lightning doesn't work as well as expected, the above things would be just fine for smallish everyday transactions. You'd keep most of your money in the main Bitcoin system, and occasionally move money onto these reduced-security systems in increments of a few hundred dollars at a time. You'd also use Bitcoin directly for larger transactions. This is somewhat analogous to the difference between ACH and wire transfers in US banking.

If what he says is true, then this confirms that Coinbase has left Bitcoin. It also means that they are totally insecure, since they could be tricked by even a rather small percentage of mining power into accepting invalid bitcoins. I don't actually think that it is true, though: he seems to be deeply misinformed about how Bitcoin works, and he's contradicting coblee.
Given this response, I'm very satisfied with the decision to remove Coinbase from bitcoin.org. They clearly have no idea how Bitcoin works, and it's even less clear whether or not they're actually a Bitcoin company.
Edit: With his edit to the statement to include "longest valid chain", it's a good statement. The strength of his statement actually puts Coinbase above most Bitcoin businesses in this area. So I have no objection to restoring Coinbase to bitcoin.org.

First of all, "disabled" is a bit of a misnomer. Those opcodes were outright *removed*, and there isn't any plan to add them all back in at some point, or anything like that.
Very early on (early 2010, IIRC), two huge bugs in Script were found by ArtForz and privately reported to Satoshi:
* You could steal anyone's BTC by spending the BTC using a scriptSig of `OP_TRUE OP_RETURN`. Yes, really. There was also another separate flaw in how Script worked which also allowed for stealing anyone's BTC.
* There were several ways of causing all network nodes to crash when trying to verify a malicious transaction. This was done by creating very large strings or numbers within a script. Script numbers are unlimited-precision integers, so they can take up any number of bytes.
Satoshi, who I imagine was quite upset at learning that his 3-year project was on the verge of being totally demolished by bugs in the Script system that he added right at the end as an afterthought, reacted by removing in a softfork all Script functionality which he thought looked even remotely dangerous, including almost all functionality which touched strings or unlimited-precision integers. OP_XOR, which operated on unlimited-precision integers, was one such casualty.

Bitcoin is the longest *valid* chain. If you allow invalid chains, then you're allowing miners to create as many bitcoins as they want, spend whatever coins they want, and do other such evil. Since you can fit the majority of mining power onto one stage, this would probably be far more centralized than even the US dollar. Thankfully, Bitcoin does not actually work like this. If you run Bitcoin Core, block chains containing any blocks greater than 1 MB will always be rejected no matter how many miners support it. Even if you run XT, chains containing blocks greater than 8 MB will always be rejected no matter what. In both cases, transactions spending already-spent coins are rejected no matter what. These hard rules of Bitcoin that full nodes enforce *no matter what* are what make Bitcoin secure.
If you're actually not enforcing any of Bitcoin's consensus rules, and are accepting the longest chain regardless of its validity, then you've already left Bitcoin. I don't think that this is actually the case (you should ask coblee to explain it to you), but it's very disturbing to me and probably many of your other customers that you would say so, since you're basically saying, "We have no security whatsoever, and we're proud of it!" If you were actually operating like this, then probably even 25% of mining power could work together to steal all of the bitcoins in at least your hot wallet.
So your statement here actually makes the situation worse. No one knows what you're doing, apparently not even you...
Look, I've been with Bitcoin very nearly since its beginning, and almost all of my work is pro bono. My primary concern in all of my roles is Bitcoin's long-term survival and usefulness. So while I admit that I'm not the most diplomatic person around, I'm *not* just randomly being a jerk when I say this stuff. It's definitely possible for reasonable people to disagree with me and my actions, but I can tell that you're just deeply misinformed about how Bitcoin does work and should work. So *please*, have a long conversation with Wladimir or someone else who actually knows what they're talking about. Even your own coblee seems to be pretty well-informed, but you're clearly not listening to him, since there's no way he'd say something like "Coinbase will always support the longest chain in bitcoin" and expect to get a good response from experts.

No, I don't see any need for that, and I think that it's unstable or less stable if nodes will accept a block at some height and then some time later replace this block with a block at the same height but with higher "real difficulty".  All blocks in a given difficulty period should have equal work value.
Something might need to be done regarding difficulty adjustments. Otherwise miners choosing to increase their difficulty would have the effect of increasing the average time between blocks, which would work against transaction capacity in the short-term and "unfairly" reduce difficulty later. Almost certainly, someone has already solved this problem, but I don't know the solution off-hand.

The relay network is an open-source but centralized network. The popular relay network right now is run by BlueMatt, but with the unfortunate level of mining centralization that currently exists,  the majority of mining power could very easily just set up their own invite-only version, exclude all other miners, and push their longest chain to the network via brute force if necessary (ie. they'd enumerate all listening full nodes, which is easy, and send them the blocks directly).

The plan is for each block to commit to the root of a hash tree of all UTXOs as of that block. Then you can sync backwards by assuming that TOP_BLOCK-1000's UTXO set is valid, validating blocks from there, moving to TOP_BLOCK-2000, and so on. There's no need for a checkpoint block -- it's reasonable to just assume that blocks 2 years deep in the longest chain are valid.

No, Classic is programmed to diverge from Bitcoin at 75% of *mining* power. Mining power is unrelated to the number of nodes (and also unrelated to the economic support).
A passive Sybil like this will only cause denial of service. Nodes will find it difficult to locate real nodes to communicate with. More evil is possible when the attacker is actually behaving maliciously, especially if the attacker can completely surround your node.
See:  . (I wrote the first version of that section in 2010.) Bitcoin has pretty much always had at least some Sybil protection, though IIRC some new stuff was added more recently.

Brian has constantly been giving the impression that he's on the brink of switching Coinbase completely to XT.

After Brian's tweet, I agreed with Cobra (and many others) that this indicated that Coinbase had left Bitcoin. I know who you are and tend to trust you, so after your statement there I would've at least left the PR open longer, but I guess Cobra either didn't know who you are or he didn't believe that you could effectively speak for Coinbase in this matter.
If Coinbase releases an *official* statement repeating what you're saying here and at least promising not to abandon Bitcoin for XT (or similar) without some reasonable advance notice, Cobra and I wouldn't veto a PR re-adding Coinbase. Though it'd still have to go through the normal bitcoin.org consensus process, in which I would be mildly opposed for the reasons that I posted there. But I guess luke-jr and some other regular contributors are OK with re-adding Coinbase.

Being good for the price isn't the same as being good for Bitcoin, of course. On that front I'm not sure that the ETF will have much effect, and if it does have an effect, it'll probably be negative: some big failure of the ETF (theft, etc.), increased regulatory attention, etc.

Bitcoin Classic is an altcoin as far as I'm concerned. The deleted post was very obviously about this altcoin, not about any of the changes within it which might otherwise be relevant to Bitcoin.
If you disagree with me, fine. But that doesn't change the fact that this sort of software is considered off-topic on Take it elsewhere.
My deletion of this meta post was consistent with my past actions and policies. Since Bitcoin Classic is an altcoin, it should be *obvious* that it would be removed, and posts about this mod action would be off-topic and removed, similarly to how a post like "Censored: front page thread about Litecoin" would be removed.

If you change Classic's rollout mechanism to just a flag day 6 months from when it's introduced, it looks reasonably safe to me. There may still be problems with worst-case blocks taking many minutes to verify, though.
SegWit basically does the same thing, though, and better. With the Core roadmap, we'll have blocks effectively 2 MB in size in only around 4 months, and it'll be backward-compatible. Also very important is that it enables future deployment of fraud proofs, which will make Bitcoin way stronger against attacks by miners (a serious concern with the existing amount of miner centralization). It also fixes the slow verification issue. Late this year a "real" max block size increase following something like Classic's design can be scheduled. So the Classic change seems entirely worse to me, especially when so many experts have signed onto the Core roadmap.
(To be clear: I'm talking about the *changes* in Bitcoin Classic. Since Bitcoin Classic implements a contentious hardfork, I wouldn't support it unless it actually overtakes the economy.)

The issue is usually that the attacker is creating too many junk connections, but in order to do a LN micropayment, you need to open a TCP connection to the recipient. So it doesn't make sense to use LN in that way.
You could probably require LN micropayments to Tor nodes in order to use them for relaying, but since Tor is fundamentally centralized anyway, it'd be better to use blinded bearer certificates instead. And I doubt that the Tor project would want to require payments anyway, so I was thinking of just a hashcash-type PoW.
A long time ago, maybe before Bitcoin, someone created a modified Tor network which used blinded-bearer-certificate micropayments. It was targeted toward filesharing, offering the same anonymity but high speeds. It died after a year or two, though, and I forget the name.

You can't get that kind of rate without risk, especially when it's crypto-denominated. Any interest-paying deposit account has to be fractional reserve. USD money-market accounts (currently paying a percent or two) invest only in the lowest-risk bonds, and they've *still* occasionally defaulted in the past. I doubt that deposits here are being used on anything nearly as low-risk. Furthermore, due to high volatility, crypto-denominated loans are generally very risky because the price might substantially rise, making repayment difficult for the borrower, and this risk for the borrower creates extra risk of default for the lender.
Also, although I just now heard of this company and I only spent 10 minutes looking at their website, the whole thing smells like a ponzi scheme. The *highly regular*, large, compounding, guaranteed-sounding interest payments are a real red flag.
Now, I *can* see how it could work if there is an extremely high demand and low supply for crypto-denominated loans (driving the high interest rate), and BlockFi is filling this demand in the form of either loans backed by significant crypto collateral (reducing risk from volatility) or loans to institutions with very high credit ratings. But even then the risk would be higher than any savings account, and my intuition is that there isn't actually enough demand for crypto loans. So I certainly wouldn't deposit any money here without seeing a *very* thorough prospectus, at least.
Some choice quotes from their ToS (my emphasis):
* "BlockFi and our third party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions, or other operational or technical difficulties which could result in the immediate halt of deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrency either temporarily **or permanently**. BlockFi is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of deposits or withdrawals."
* "These Terms and the deposit relationship do not create a fiduciary relationship between us."
* "Your Crypto Interest Account is not a checking or savings account, and it is not covered by insurance against losses. We will lend, sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of funds and cryptocurrency assets to counterparties, and we will use our commercial best efforts to prevent losses. [...] The nature of cryptocurrency means that any technological difficulties experienced by BlockFi may prevent the access or use of a customer’s cryptocurrency. Any bond or trust account maintained by BlockFi for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers"
* "We are not liable to you for claims, costs, losses or damages caused by an event that is beyond our reasonable control (e.g., the **acts or omissions of third parties**, natural disaster, emergency conditions, government action, equipment or communications malfunction). We are not liable for special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential losses or damages of any kind."

Bitcoin Core isn't itself really funded at all. It's a loose association of independent developers, not much of an organization. Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir works for MIT, which is probably pretty neutral (though there are undoubtedly many bad things you could say about MIT). Two regular Core developers are Blockstream employees, which has some banker-style investors, though a majority stake in Blockstream is held by the Bitcoin true believers who founded it. There are over 100 other Core contributors (with varying degrees of contribution) who work independently or for other entities. It's pretty decentralized.
But this issue is often framed as "Do you want Core in charge of Bitcoin, or or XT/Classic/BU in charge of Bitcoin?", and this is not the right way of looking at it. People who support the Core roadmap are **not** proposing that Core should be given the "keys to Bitcoin" now and forever. We're just saying that what they're doing *now* is largely on the right track. XT/Classic/BU on the other hand *does* have plenty of people with the clear objective of being the single decision-making entity in Bitcoin.
I believe that every organization is corruptible and will, given enough time, eventually be corrupted, no matter how well-designed. I absolutely do not support blindly trusting Bitcoin Core or any of its contributors. I certainly don't support blindly trusting Blockstream, which is a for-profit legal entity. But that doesn't mean that people should start doing crazy things just for the sake of "diversity", as if this was some sort of affirmative action campaign. If the people who have a long history of doing great work and coming up with great ideas say something, you should listen, and if you disagree you should exhaust every possible way in which *you* could be wrong before you start freaking out. And even if 100% of nodes run Bitcoin Core, this is not a decentralization issue as long as it's *possible* for any of them to switch; it's the *possibility* of defecting which creates decentralization here, not the actual node distribution.
It's interesting to look back at a time when [some people were worried that I would blindly follow anything that Gavin did]( back when he was Bitcoin Core lead developer. When Gavin was doing good work, I was a vocal supporter of his. When he went off the rails, I strongly opposed his crazy ideas. Now the current developers are following a pretty reasonable roadmap which I vocally support, so the conspiracy theorists have moved onto saying that I am now totally committed to the current Core team.

I would imagine that ~all Core devs support a PoW change in case of an attack by miners, since Bitcoin is blatantly insecure if such a PoW change isn't possible. Doing it preemptively would be more controversial.

Bitcoin isn't like BitTorrent -- bandwidth isn't the main limited resource. The main limited resource is *connection slots*, which you provide as long as you're accepting connections. You'll get more connections if your node has high uptime and if your IP address doesn't change. If you have a dynamic IP address, it'd be helpful for you to [set up a Tor hidden service](
However, the best thing that you can do is not just run a node somewhere, but to actually *use it* for transactions. See

Bitcoin Core has always avoided connecting to IPs belonging to the same ISP. Only very large Sybil attacks (5-10x more Sybil nodes than real nodes) have much chance of causing real problems.
This is just some idiots paying a bunch of money to move a line on a chart.

As a transitional step, SegWit will initially use specially-crafted P2SH addresses that old wallets know how to send to, at the cost of some space inefficiency. Later on, special SegWit addresses will be rolled out. Now that you mention it, I think that you could similarly use P2SH addresses with method 2.


This isn't generally possible because new UTXOs will often not be known to old nodes, so new transactions will look to old nodes as if they're spending coins that don't exist.

"Flexcap" refers to the following general idea:
* Miners can make blocks that are larger than a baseline max block size, but in order to do so they must mine at a higher difficulty than normal. So if you want to make a block that's 5% larger than the baseline, you might have to mine at a higher difficulty which makes you 1% less likely to actually solve the block, for example. This introduces a concrete cost to creating larger blocks.
* The baseline max block size mentioned above is not a fixed value, but is set to be the median of the declared size of the last 1000 blocks or whatever. (Or something in this general vein.)
* For safety, there might be a higher hard limit on the max block size which the above mechanism still cannot exceed. This limit might be dynamic in other ways.
This allows the transaction capacity to dynamically increase whenever there are enough fees waiting to be claimed in 0-conf transactions to convince miners to mine at a higher difficulty in order to make room for them.
There have been several flexcap proposals with different specifics based on the above general idea.
It's still a popular idea, but there's not much interest in working on additional max block size increases until SegWit activates and the effects of its max block size increase are observed. Also, over the last year or so concerns have increased about the growth in the size of the UTXO set. The maximum non-witness block size is currently the only constraint on UTXO-set growth. So these old proposals might need to be modified to address this somehow. My preferred solution would be to add another hard limit on the net number of UTXOs each block can create, but some people find this too kludgy and would prefer a more long-term solution like TXO commitments.
Note that sometimes misinformed people use the term "flexcap" to mean *any* max block size that adjusts itself, but this usage is confusingly incorrect. *That* idea is called "dynamic block sizes", of which flexcap is a specific sub-idea.

Although the PoW can be changed in a softfork, this wouldn't be a softfork as people normally think of them. Unless the current miners cooperate with the PoW-change softfork, which seems unlikely at any time and very unlikely now, you still have a situation where the network/currency splits into pre-softfork nodes and post-softfork nodes. It's technically a softfork because the consensus rules are only strengthened and pre-softfork nodes might eventually be able to accept the post-softfork chain, but in practice it's very similar to a hardfork. So my view is that in most cases where a PoW change is necessary/desirable, it'd be better to just do a hardfork. *Maybe* a softfork PoW change is somewhat plausible if the goal is purely to improve the PoW algorithm (rather than having a goal of firing the current miners) and it takes place over a very long period of time (maybe 1-2 years until activation and 3-4 years until current mining hardware is completely useless).
A second problem is that there is no consensus on what the PoW should be changed *to*. There have been hundreds of different proposals over the years with all sorts of different tradeoffs, but there are no clear winners. If you asked 20 top Bitcoin experts which new-PoW they'd prefer, you'd probably get ~20 different answers. The ideas vary a lot in the specific details, but the rough categories are:
* ASIC-easy, like today. SHA-3, etc. Upside: Known to be at least basically secure. Downside: Very likely we'd end up in the same centralized-mining situation in 6-18 months.
* Use something other than computation to restrict the PoW, such as memory latency (eg. cuckoo) or storage space. Upside: We'd probably get a different set of miners, and the distribution might be more decentralized. Downsides: These algorithms have not received enough review to demonstrate their efficacy. For example, cuckoo is only *conjectured* to have no significant time-memory tradeoff. Also, mining might be dominated by botnets, which is far from ideal (though it'd still probably be less centralized than today).
* Use algorithms which frequently change themselves randomly, or some other algorithm which requires some sort of general-purpose computation hardware. Upside: This might result in a different, more decentralized set of miners. It should be possible to do securely. Downsides: Probably, any algorithm will fail in the long-run to actually work better on commodity CPUs than dedicated hardware; even if you somehow create an algorithm that uses almost all of x86, mining isn't going to be doing any of the context-switching, security stuff, caching, etc. that a real CPU needs to spend a lot of its time doing. If you somehow do make it so that only modern CPUs can mine efficiently, then congrats, you've just given Intel a monopoly on the best-performing mining devices (Intel is far ahead of AMD in x86 processor design, and there basically is nobody in third place).
* Use multiple of the above in a hybrid. Upside: Maybe some of those weaknesses would be removed. Downside: It increases complexity and makes the system more difficult to reason about. There's also no consensus on *how* to hybridize multiple PoW algorithms.
* Add PoS in hybrid with one of the above. (Note that *pure* PoS is known to be completely insecure. It must be used in a hybrid with PoW, such as in Meni Rosenfeld's Proof of Activity proposal.) Upside: Maybe this'd remove some of the weaknesses of the PoW solutions. Downside: It increases complexity and makes the system more difficult to reason about. There's no consensus on *how* to hybridize PoS+PoW. Also, many Bitcoin experts are skeptical of PoS in general.
(When I say above that there's no consensus on how to do something, I don't mean that *there's no known way to do it*. Many of these things have been tried in altcoins with greater or lesser degrees of success. I mean that there are *many* possible ways of doing it, but there's no agreement on which one has the best benefits vs costs, or in many cases what those benefits and costs really even are.)
In case of an *attack by miners*, there's a rough plan to switch to SHA-3 or a slight variant of SHA-3. But that's not necessarily ideal, just something that's known to be reasonably safe and can be done quickly. To change the PoW in the absence of an attack would require *tons* of research and discussion.

That wouldn't help if blockr.io was hacked instead of just stuck.

For example, a Bitcoin ATM relying on blockr.io could be convinced to give up all of its USD without receiving any actual BTC.

Good-but-controversial comments frequently get to -5 within minutes on Since most people use the default settings, this shuts down debate and seriously promotes groupthink. I guess maybe if the default was -50 or something it'd be more reasonable here, though I'm not a fan of the feature in any case. Like it or not, Redditors use upvotes/downvotes as "agree"/"disagree", and it's not healthy for discussion if unpopular opinions are hidden by default. Some subreddits "solve" this by hidding the downvote arrow via CSS, but I'm not a fan of this because anyone can turn it off by disabling subreddit CSS. Score hiding in combination with this CSS hack seems to work pretty well at reducing groupthink-based voting and discussion.

Double-spending in this way is clear (and cryptographically-provable) fraud, similar to writing a check which you know is bad in order to buy stuff delivered immediately. In fact, since the ATM probably collects video evidence along with extensive KYC data, you could argue that it's not *that* crazy to accept transactions 0-conf in this particular case, since any double-spending fraud is so easy to prove, and you have a good chance of actually tracking down the perpetrator.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:03:33


Not really. If you continue to validate only traditional blocks, not the witnesses, then you're only enforcing a subset of Bitcoin's rules. In this case you're like a SPV node, but somewhat better because you enforce more rules. Real full nodes have to download all of the witness data when downloading transactions/blocks, and someone has to remember the witness stuff (for at least a couple years, probably) so that other full nodes can download and verify it when they join the network.
SegWit does allow for future deployment of fraud proofs, which will significantly increase security. You'll be able to run in the reduced-verification mode above, or just plain SPV, but yet still be able to enforce the rules by being able to receive and understand fraud proofs showing that the longest chain is invalid. If all SPV nodes and even some of the weaker full nodes switched to SPV + fraud proofs, Bitcoin would be *massively* more secure. Note however that it is still somewhat less secure to do SPV + fraud proofs than a full node because an attacker might still be able to stop all fraud proofs before they get to you -- this sort of threat model isn't really defended against in the Bitcoin P2P protocol right now, and it's more difficult to defend against in general.


I feel comfortable with blocks up to a very-theoretical *4* MB, which is the maximum for 1 MB normal-blocks. Though if miners were stupid or evil enough to actually create 4 MB blocks consistently in the next year or two, this would be somewhat worrying, but there's no economic incentive for anyone to do this other than to harm Bitcoin.

Yes, see:

1.6 assumes that that all transactions are pay-to-pubkey-hash transactions (ie. transactions with addresses starting with 1). The savings are increased when dealing with multisig transactions (ie. transactions to addresses starting with 3), which are very common. 2 MB is a reasonable average-case estimate.
The upper-bound worst-case certainly is *4. A miner can do it by adding a many transactions with hundred+-KB witnesses.

A lot of it is FUD spread by people either trying to hurt Bitcoin or trying to push out the Core devs.
Some think that SegWit will not be rolled out quickly enough. The code will be ready in April, and the binary release will be in April or May. Then miners have to deploy it, which could happen within weeks or could take longer, depending on how cooperative miners are being. Then wallets need to be updated to actually make use of SegWit. (Though it's not necessary for 100% of wallets to upgrade for overall capacity to increase.) We could see near-doubled capacity before the end of May, or it could take longer - it's not clear. But I still view this as far better than a hardfork, which requires that *everyone* upgrades in order to use Bitcoin at all. And a *contentious* hardfork would just be pure disaster.
There's a perception that blocks are dangerously full, but [they're probably not]( Most of the issues during the spam attack were due to wallets having dumb fee-choosing procedures. When the network is being spammed, it is appropriate for everyone making transactions to pay more. Saying that blocks should be able to just arbitrarily increase in size is saying that full nodes should bear the cost of spam attacks and increased tx volume, even though full nodes are unpaid and Bitcoin would be insecure if the majority of the economy didn't use full nodes.
If there really is an emergency, like if it costs $1 to send typical transactions even in the absence of a spam attack, then the contentiousness of a 2 MB hardfork would almost certainly disappear, and we could hardfork quickly. (But I consider this emergency situation to be very unlikely.)

Since I was considering the scenario in which the definition of Bitcoin depended only on the longest chain, I was thinking about the hypothetical scenario in which full nodes didn't verify anything but the longest chain. If a big chunk of the economy does verify additional rules, then miners absolutely do have a strong incentive not to break those rules. But miners still *can* break the rules and produce a longer invalid chain, so I still disagree with the definition.


Of course.

The pre-release version had a different genesis block, so it would be incompatible. AFAIK we only have bits and pieces, though, not something that you could actually compile&amp;run.
Since there haven't been any true hardforks, it should be theoretically possible to fully sync 0.1 using a special proxy between it and the network plus changes to its Berkeley DB settings.

He didn't say that.
The 1 MB limit was added because Satoshi realized that if someone created very large blocks for long enough, the network would fall apart because everyone would process the blocks too slowly. He saw it as just another DoS attack. (In reality, the Bitcoin client of Satoshi's time probably couldn't keep up with even 1 MB blocks for very long, and it might've taken hours to process a 32 MB block in some cases, though Satoshi likely didn't know these things.) I don't think that he thought very far ahead when adding it, except to acknowledge that it could be removed later if doing so became a good idea. I have a detailed post about this:

Nope, take a look at what I [said]( a few months after Satoshi added the 1 MB limit:






This is pretty much exactly what I've been saying all along. It has many of the important points that I constantly talk about nowadays:
* It is extremely bad if the network/economy becomes fragmented.
* We should first determine with great certainty that the network actually can handle bigger blocks before increasing the max block size.
* Economic consensus is required. The devs should lead the way, but are not all-powerful.
* Miners are irrelevant in a hardfork. So a flag day should be used, not some sort of miner voting.
In some of my old posts I get some of the details wrong, but my overall thinking on these matters is very consistent.
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:36:31
That statement seems at least mostly correct. "Economic majority" is debatable; for a hardfork I tend to believe that near-unanimity is required rather than a mere majority, but I think that and some others do think that an economic majority is sufficient.

I wouldn't describe CoinJoin as "traceable" in general. Depending on how it's done, its security can be comparable to Monero's ring signatures. They both function in the same basic way: if you know that someone owns coin *C* and you want to know what happens to it, after the Monero-transaction or CoinJoin you know that it is in one of *n* places, but you can't tell which one. In both cases, it is *possible* to unravel things, since you do have a fairly small subset of inputs/outputs and their histories to analyze and try to confirm/eliminate, but it generally requires an awful lot of data/analysis. With more CoinJoins or Monero-transactions, it becomes exponentially more complicated to figure out, potentially to the point of practical impossibility. In fact, a single Wasabi CoinJoin is probably better at mixing coins than if you did a single BTC-&gt;XMR-&gt;BTC conversion, though Monero is certainly far better at keeping you anonymous if you stay within its economy.
Although I wouldn't put it past Coinbase to do things in this general vein, I think that Bitcoin_21 fabricated that particular quote, especially since it doesn't make technical sense. Dandelion is more-or-less equivalent to using Bitcoin over Tor; something like this is necessary, *but far from sufficient*, for privacy. Dandelion is also network-only, not requiring a softfork

No, there are just too many possible guesses.
Imagine a massive wall of lockers. Each locker is 1mm by 1mm, and the entire wall of lockers is a square 2 light years on each side. When you choose a private key, you pick one of these lockers *at random*. When someone sends you bitcoins, there's some magical inbox which puts the bitcoins into your locker without telling the sender anything about the location of your locker.
The lockers don't have locks. If someone knew the location of your locker (ie. your private key), then they could just go take what's in it. Similarly, it's *possible* to choose a locker at random and find that someone has used it already at some point in the past. But there are just *so many* lockers that in reality it's never going to happen, even if humanity devotes all of its efforts to searching through all of the lockers.

Because 75% of miners can easily support something while only a very small percentage of the economy does. Look at the BIP 66 incident, for example, or the very quick activation of CLTV.

I think:
For some time, Satoshi lurked on various cypherpunk mailing lists. It was a little hobby of his, but he wasn't famous or a major participant. One day the idea for Bitcoin came to him. He wasn't sure that it'd work, but he was excited about it, so he thought that he'd give implementing it a try. In the two years that it took him to finish 0.1, new interesting facets of the problem presented themselves, and he was able to solve them. He considered a number of future use-cases, and added support for them to his software. When it all seemed to be working OK, he released it.
You have to understand that the ideas behind Bitcoin are not way out there. All of the crypto already existed, and even the idea of a block chain already largely existed in the form of git. Satoshi didn't need to be a mathematician, cryptographer, or master software engineer to come up with the ideas behind Bitcoin and then implement them. In fact, I think that Satoshi might not have been much of a programmer before building Bitcoin. But he was dedicated and detail-oriented. Maybe he read a good C++ book front-to-back before starting on the coding, and then put real effort into following best practices (with a large amount of success, though some imperfection).
In 2009 Satoshi was probably disappointed that Bitcoin wasn't getting much attention. But when things started picking up in 2010, he enjoyed explaining Bitcoin to people. He liked talking about the technology that he'd spent so much time thinking about and coding.
But then various more difficult problems arose. He didn't have a solid idea for long-term scalablity. He'd always planned to implement SPV in his client, but doing so looked like it'd take some major hacking. He'd had vague plans of auctions &amp; trading systems built into the client, but he couldn't find a good design for these things. Etc. Additionally, he was having to deal more and more with people, which he didn't much enjoy. Some people started to question his technical decisions, making it more difficult for him to make changes, and he couldn't always depend on miners running his code. There was also wikileaks and Gavin's CIA visit. All in all, Satoshi probably felt like he was losing track of the project, and moreover he didn't see anything technology-wise that he particularly wanted to work on; the programming that needed to be done was huge and/or conceptually very difficult (including some things which haven't been settled even today). So he just gradually lost interest. Most people forget that he didn't just completely vanish one day; first he left the forum and only responded via email, then he only responded to a handful of his usual correspondents via email, and finally he stopped responding to even these people.
After his last forum post were he said he was "venturing into more complex ideas", I think that this was not some hint that he was quitting Bitcoin and doing something else. I think that sometime after this post he actually did do a lot of work on solving some big technical problem, but failed to really solve it. And then when he looked back at the Bitcoin community, where there were now a few devs (Gavin, Sirius, lazslo, etc.) doing some work, and some real companies/organizations starting to form, he found it too tempting to just leave things alone.

Algorithms alone can't do it; you need *data*. If everyone participating in a CoinJoin is funding directly from a Coinbase wallet, then sure, anyone with access to Coinbase's database can unravel it. But even in this ridiculous case, you'll never do it by just *looking* at the transaction graph: the ownership data is the key.
Wasabi CoinJoins have 50 (IIRC) participants. If you can somehow investigate *all* of those possibilities sufficiently to either eliminate them or link them to the target input, then you can get somewhere. But that's *serious investigation*, probably requiring masses of subpoenas and months or years of investigation. Unless massive ecosystem-wide centralization is instituted, nobody will have enough data to do this sort of investigation passively, and I doubt anyone but governments have any real hope of ever pulling off such an investigation actively.
If you want to assume that all of your transaction history is public, that's fine. That's the safest thing to do. Most people substantially *overestimate* the strength of anonymity systems, and there are countless ways of leaking identity info through things like timing even if your CoinJoins succeed at breaking the transaction graph. But the fact is that well-done CoinJoins *do* frustrate tx-analysis attacks very significantly, if not *perfectly*.


Now this is true, but this sort of "taint" is a stupid concept anyway, and the sooner all coins have been tainted via CoinJoins, the better.

A transaction can be a mix of SegWit and non-SegWit inputs and outputs. There are two types of SegWit inputs and two types of SegWit outputs: unlocking/sending-to native SegWit addresses and unlocking/sending-to P2SH-wrapped SegWit addresses. Only the latter will actually be supported by wallets in the beginning, though the base protocol has to support both from the start. Here are examples of the four types: 
So if you see an input with a scriptSig of `0x160014{20-byte-key-hash}` unlocking a prev-out with a scriptPubKey of `0xA914{20-byte-script-hash}87`, you know that it's unlocking BTC previously sent to a P2SH-wrapped SegWit pay-to-pubkey-hash address (one of the two types of SegWit address that will be supported by wallets initially), and the real witness data (ie. signature, etc.) will be in the new SegWit fields of the transaction.

Node counts can't reasonably be used for anything like that, since they're easy to manipulate, and each node will have different views of the node counts.

* There was a sharp increase in the fees paid per block (high-fee spam) and the typical automatic minrelayfee (low-fee spam), and then this subsided after some hours. Typical spam behavior.
* 
* I noticed the appearance of a large number of long-chain transactions always paying exactly 0.0005 BTC as a fee, happening right around the same time as the fee issues, though perhaps this is coincidence. It's often pretty difficult to actually locate spam transactions. Last time, the spam transactions weren't located until a few days after the attack, even though the attacker was sending so many transactions that he was burning tens of thousands of USD in fees per day.

* If you don't use LN, you will be paying massively higher fees by doing on-chain transactions exclusively. (LN fees will be very low.)
* If you use LN but don't route transactions, you will pay *x* fees for your own transactions.
* If you use LN but do route transactions, you will pay *x* fees for your own transactions, but get *y* fees (*y* &lt; *x*, probably) from transactions routed through your node.
The third option is the cheapest, assuming that it's not very difficult for you to run a LN node.

There is no "the mempool". Every node has a different mempool. The mempool size numbers reported by various sites are largely worthless.
The default Bitcoin Core behavior is to limit the size of the mempool to 300 MB. If you charted the size of a default Bitcoin Core mempool over time, it would almost always be at 200-300MB. This is normal. When a transaction comes in which would cause the mempool to exceed its limit, enough of the lowest-feerate transaction(s) in the mempool are evicted to make room. Also, transactions will not be accepted into the mempool or relayed if they have a fee rate lower than the lowest-feerate transaction in the mempool. Transactions are also evicted from the mempool after 72 hours.

Looking at mempool numbers is pointless. There is no "the mempool". Every node has a different mempool. The mempool size numbers reported by various sites are largely worthless. With default Bitcoin Core settings, a node's mempool size is *almost always* 200-300 MB in size.
What clearly is a problem is when transactions get stuck. However, this is mainly an issue with wallets that don't estimate fees well. People who are seeing stuck transactions are generally paying 15 sat/B or less, while my Bitcoin Core suggests paying at least 30 sat/B with current network conditions. *The network is constantly changing* -- you can't just pick one fee and stick with it, or even pick one fee and plan to update it every now and then.
The higher required fee right now is probably due to an attack aimed at clogging the queue with high-fee transactions. In general: To make it impossible for anyone to get a transaction through with a fee less than $x per kB, an attacker needs to pay roughly 1000 kB * $x per block. So to raise the required fee to $1/kB requires that the attacker burns about $1000 in fees per block, for example.
Ideally, wallets should notice this and say, "There's a spam attack going on. You can either pay this above-average fee to outbid the attacker or you can wait a while." Also, wallets should support RBF and/or CPFP to allow people to adjust fees after transaction creation. But in reality, most wallets just pay some constant or slowly-updating fee, which is what's causing most of the trouble.
If the max block size is doubled, then the cost to raise the required fee to a certain level is also roughly doubled. So when SegWit increases the effective max block size to ~2 MB, this attack will become more expensive. But if wallets use a fixed fee, then it still won't require all that much money to fill blocks with slightly-above-average fees. Fee estimation is required in any case.
Furthermore, I've seen a number of people saying stuff like, "If there's an attack, then the max block size should be able to increase arbitrarily to absorb it." This is a very misinformed statement. Obviously both miners (in some cases) and people who make transactions want larger blocks, but the larger blocks are on average, the more expensive it is to run a full node in terms of bandwidth, CPU usage, and disk space. And full nodes do not (and, most experts believe, cannot reasonably) get any reward for supporting increased transaction volume. So in other words, block size is a negative externality suffered by full nodes due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers, and running full nodes is a positive externality provided by full nodes to the benefit of everyone who uses Bitcoin (Bitcoin is absolutely insecure if not enough of the economy is backed by full nodes). And there's no reason to think that miners or transaction-makers would voluntarily keep blocks small enough -- since it's a common goods problem, neither has the right incentives. Bitcoin's solution to this issue is for full nodes to enforce a max block size small enough to allow full nodes to operate with a reasonably low cost. Removing the limit would make spam attacks even worse, since spammers would be able to directly attack Bitcoin's volunteer full nodes (and therefore Bitcoin's *decentralization*) rather than just increase fees temporarily.
Yes, the max block size limits the total number of transactions, and if everyone who is currently transacting (right now including spammers) was willing to pay an infinite amount of money to keep transacting, then fees would go to infinity. But that's not how it would actually work. In reality, rising fees make the *reasonable minimum on-chain transaction value* smaller and smaller. Therefore, people who are using on-chain transactions to transfer just a few dollars get *pushed out* in a rising fees scenario, making room for people who want to transfer larger values -- eventually, an equilibrium is reached. This pricing-out of small-value transactions *has already happened*: no one tries to use Bitcoin for moving a few cents of value nowadays. It is not in itself a *good* thing that anyone gets priced out in this way -- it'd be nice if we could costlessly do all the transactions that everyone ever wanted on-chain -- but at least some degree of this is unavoidable and survivable.

It takes more than one transaction to cause that, and that's only a problem when you give estimatefee a small block-count (&lt;= ~2).
For the special case of small block-counts, maybe estimatefee should use the average or median instead of the 95th percentile.

The second point in my list above ("syncing backward") is similar to that. With this change, every block would be required to contain the root hash of a hash tree of all UTXOs. Then, during the initial sync you would go through three stages:
* First, you would download all block headers to determine the longest chain. After this is done, the Bitcoin Core wallet should ideally already start working.
* Then you would take a block from a few months ago on the longest chain, download all of the UTXOs in its UTXO tree, and start fully verifying blocks from that point. After this is done, you're an "almost-full node".
* This is the part you missed: Just doing the above two steps decreases Bitcoin's overall security because you're trusting that all of the blocks that you didn't verify are valid. It's very unlikely that any of them are invalid, but you don't know *for sure*, and Bitcoin is about zero trust and following the rules no matter what. So you can slowly sync backward by moving your "UTXO block" further and further back and then verifying another set of blocks. This can be done slowly in the background. Once this is done, you're 100% sure that you're on the real Bitcoin network, and you can call yourself a real full node.

If I was in the UK, I'd absolutely vote to leave. The EU is headed by a bunch of unelected former communists trying to gradually create a big-government United States of Europe. (I'm not exaggerating about the "former communist" thing, look it up.) The UK alone has some problems, but you're far better off away from this nonsense. At least then you have *some* chance of improving your problems.
I do think that leaving will cause a short-term devaluation of UK stocks (and probably the whole world's stocks, as well). Not sure about the GBP. Maybe. But your problems will be far worse in the EU, where the Euro is a total failure and the UK is often footing the bill (remember how the EU bailed out Greece, largely using UK taxpayer money?). Investing mainly in hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin would be a good way to minimize your risk.
The UK has a trade deficit with the EU, so I doubt tariffs will be significant. As I've heard Nigel Farage mention, even in the worst-case scenario where the EU wants to hurt themselves massively just to spite you, you'll pay less on net due to not having to pay the EU fees. And *internationally* you'll eventually have even better trade deals than now, since the EU has often been pretty protectionist.

0.12 automatically sets a reasonable min relay fee, so that's not necessary. The mempool numbers on various sites are mostly meaningless, and should be ignored. It is a problem when people get stuck transactions, but that's mostly an issue with wallet fee estimation.

I think that in practice the discount won't actually affect the UTXO set growth because almost everyone uses either P2SH or P2PKH scriptPubKeys (and everything but these and a couple others are non-standard and not relayed or mined by default). So AFAIK, UTXO set growth comes almost entirely from the net creation of new UTXOs per transaction, not from huge UTXOs, and this won't be affected by the discount.

A major remaining issue is that although you can enable pruning to significantly reduce the required disk space, the network can't currently function if everyone did this, you still need to *download* all of this data to become a full node, and you can't do any sort of rescan with pruning enabled. So for those who want to or must remain archival nodes, 4 MB blocks would be up to 210 GB of data per year, which is awfully uncomfortable. AFAICT, the solutions to this are:
* Distribute the storage of old blocks so that each node stores a few GB of a random range of old blocks. When doing the initial sync, you'll have to search out nodes that have the blocks you need.
* Do syncing backward so that you become an "almost-full node" in a short while, and then slowly work on downloading the entire history in the background over a long period of time.
* Allow rescans to work reasonably on just the unpruned section of the block chain.
* Create some sort of standard privacy-protecting protocol for offloading rescan work to block chain archive services, and/or create the capability for Bitcoin Core to be a filterblock client for network-assisted rescans.
Compact blocks does significantly improve the biggest issue preventing the safe increase of the max block size, which is bandwidth. Once it is widespread and working well, a max block size of 4-8 MB looks pretty possible.

It's also important that you use your own personal full node for your actual transactions. That way, if someone attacks the network, you'll throw your *economic* weight behind the correct network.
Aside from what you said:
* Try to keep uptime high and your IP address static.
* Forward port 8333.
* Run Tor at the same time. If you start Bitcoin Core 0.12+ while Tor is running, Bitcoin Core will automatically create a Tor hidden service. If you really want to go all-out, you could instead run a static Tor hidden service, which improves your chances of receiving Tor hidden service connections.
You shouldn't feel obligated to do any of this, though. The network is in good health already.

For each transaction hash returned by `getrawmempool`, call `getrawtransaction`. For each of these raw transactions, call `sendrawtransaction` on the new node.

Just for the sake of argument: One major difference between a world currency and local currencies is that a world currency can't embody import/export imbalances between different regions. Perhaps you could make a case that having currencies cover smaller regions is good so that export-heavy regions have higher-value currencies than import-heavy regions. (I'm not sure what the benefit of this actually is, if there is any, but it does look like a piece of market data is lost in a local -&gt; world currency transition.) In fact, perhaps it'd be possible, and for the same reason arguably beneficial, for each individual to have his own currency which freely floats in price with the currencies of all other people. (That arrangement would probably end up working somewhat like the Lightning Network or the original Ripple idea.)

That's a problem with increasing the limit on non-witness data, not really with decreasing the discount AFAICT. I agree that BlueMatt's proposal from several months ago of setting MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB while simultaneously reducing the discount to 50% would make it cheaper to expand the UTXO set. I'm not sure how big of an issue this is, though. Maybe it could be suitably handled by miners discouraging this with fee policy. It'd also be possible to introduce a limit to the number of net UTXOs a block could create, though that's pretty kludgy.
Peter Todd invented a way to limit the size of the UTXO set to some fixed value (never above 5GB, for example) in a particularly reasonable way. Basically, old UTXOs would get deleted from the UTXO set, but they'd still be spendable by requiring that the spender provide some extra data proving that the UTXO is in the un-pruned UTXO set. This is probably the ultimate solution to UTXO set growth, though it's very far from implementation.

It varies, but the fee right now is about twice the trend.
Yesterday, for a 25-block max wait before 1 confirmation, Bitcoin Core's estimatefee (similar to bitcoinfees.21.co) recommended a fee of 11 sat/B. Now it recommends 25 sat/B. The spammer is burning money, so he'll stop eventually, at which point the fee that everyone has to pay will go down again.
I think that the spam might actually be coming from some broken service sending tons of transactions in the naïve way, and with a high fixed fee of 0.0005 BTC (~150 sat/B). Eg:

Bitcoin Core has way better privacy (when used with Tor), and it is more secure overall. But if you get malware on your computer, neither one will protect you. Also, Bitcoin Core's way of dealing with backups is more difficult (you have to backup wallet.dat periodically -- with Electrum you just have to write down your seed once), and it requires a lengthy initial sync.
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:00:18
What I posted was the output of Bitcoin Core's `estimatefee`. It means: if you pay a fee of 0.00010183 BTC / KB, then your transaction will almost certainly appear in one of the next 25 blocks that the network mines, and if you pay a fee of 0.00026670 BTC / KB, your transaction will almost certainly appear in one of the next 6 blocks. (These are really conservative estimates -- more often than not, paying the 25-block rate will actually get your transaction confirmed in 1 or 2 blocks.) If people are paying fees higher than this (and they're not intentionally paying far more for more guaranteed speed), then they're overpaying for some reason, probably because of hard-coded, slow-updating, or manually-set fees in their wallet.
I doubt that relay fee limits are a problem. It's pretty uncommon to set them manually, and limits would have to be pretty widespread to actually impede transactions. With 0.12 the limit automatically adjusts itself, and can be zero. On my 0.12 node with a 300 MB mempool, the minimum relay fee is currently 0.00001627 BTC / KB.

You'll get a very tiny fee whenever someone routes transactions through you. So you'll get more fees if you're connected to more people in the "economic graph", and if you keep your node online all the time. I suspect that most people will pay more in fees than they receive, though, especially since it will from time to time be necessary to pay a more substantial on-chain transaction fee in addition to the tiny Lightning fees.

Node counts are easily manipulated and not used for anything important. For example, right after the BCH split, someone created over 10k BCH nodes for a while. I'm not sure if they were trying to attack BCH, or Bitcoin, or to promote BCH, or what, but it didn't have any effect on either network.
The reason that you should run your own full node is for *your own* security. You shouldn't just set one up on a server somewhere and forget about it; that's almost useless. You need to use it directly or indirectly for your own transactions. See:

You still need to download the data at some point. The reason for the compression here is that nodes are typically receiving transaction broadcasts all the time, and then they have to download a ~1MB block made largely of transactions that they've already seen. Compact blocks says, "I assume you've already seen transactions x, y, and z, so I won't send them again." But if a node comes online right before a 1 MB block is published, for example, then they'll have to download the full block since they won't have seen any of its transactions previously.
This is still *massively* helpful for scaling because it not only halves the overall amount of data you need to download/upload, but it spreads it out in time. Instead of needing to download 1 MB over 10 minutes and 1 MB again in ~30 seconds, you just need to download 1 MB in 10 minutes. That's a best-case minimum required download bandwidth of 280 kilobits/second vs 13 kilobits/second. (Note that the network *by far* wouldn't function if everyone only had such minimum bandwidths.)

* Make sure you're using the latest version. 0.12 is *way* faster than 0.11.
* You can put something like `dbcache=500` in your bitcoin.conf to make Bitcoin Core use 500 MB of extra memory to speed things up. The more memory you give it, the faster it'll be. But make sure you leave a couple GB of memory free.
The most common causes of database corruption are:
* Shutting down Bitcoin Core uncleanly. I've heard that on Windows, restarting without first closing Bitcoin Core can cause this.
* Bad hard drive (most common), CPU, or memory. Bitcoin Core seriously exercises your hardware, so it'll often show failures before anything else.

Most people, especially on servers, don't normally need to give any program anywhere near the hundreds of GB that will be required. The need to acquire the required storage is a significant obstacle to running a full node. For example, on DigitalOcean you'd need to pay *$160/month* to have enough disk space to store the *current* block chain.
The ideal is for *everyone* to run a full node, not just a few people who go out of their way to dedicate the required resources -- the later situation creates centralization and insecurity.
The block chain contains a lot of uncompressible hashes, signatures, and public keys. It can be compressed somewhat, but probably with a compression ratio no better than 50%.

People keep sticking block chains in places they're not needed. When you're already dealing with something centralized, a block chain is a massive waste. The missile is centralized. It can just require two signatures on its own. No need for a block chain.
Voting is another thing that people keep trying to shove into a block chain. It's pointless. Voting is almost always conducted by a centralized organization, so that centralized organization should just run a central server to deal with voting. *Crypto* is an excellent thing to use in voting, and there are a bunch of cool crypto proofs you can do regarding voting, but using a block chain for voting is worse than useless since it's wasteful and gives miners a way to influence the voting outcome.

The proposal is to require that miners maintain a hash tree of all UTXOs as of the previous block and include the root of this tree in their blocks. Nothing like this is done now, but it can be. Given this root, you'll need to fetch the full tree from someone, and using that you can fetch all of the leaf UTXOs and link them to the block. I think that the Core devs have some fancy data structures in mind (not just a plain hash tree) to do this stuff efficiently.

Not sure I understand what you mean. If your transaction will require more fees to send via LN than via an on-chain transaction, then your Bitcoin/LN client should automatically send an on-chain transaction. (Actually, it should open a new Lightning channel with the recipient.)
Example of how fees will work: Let's say that you want to pay Joe. Both you and Joe have recently purchased a game from Steam, so you both have a Lightning channel open with Steam, and you can send the transaction via these channels and Steam. You'll pay Steam a very small fee here for acting as an intermediary, maybe a few hundred satoshi.
Now let's say that Joe wants to withdraw money from an exchange that you also use. This transaction can go Exchange-&gt;You-&gt;Steam-&gt;Joe. The exchange will have to pay both you and Steam a small fee.
I predict that most people won't get all that many fees because they only have a few "economic links" like this, and they also won't have all that much BTC available for effecting routes. If anyone makes money from LN fees on net, it'll probably be Bitcoin companies with a lot of customers.
(I haven't been following LN development all that closely, so it's possible things have changed.)

One of the most helpful things you can do is to just use a full node for your personal transactions, either directly or by using some lightweight wallet that connects to your full node (like Copay as someone mentioned elsewhere in this thread). This builds Bitcoin's [economic strength]( Using a full node for your own transactions is worthwhile even if you're otherwise "leeching", such as if you can't forward port 8333.
During the initial sync, all aspects of a computer are stressed: disk (a SSD helps a lot), memory (dedicating a few GB of memory to Bitcoin Core using the dbcache setting helps a lot), CPU, and bandwidth. Having better hardware will allow for a faster syncing. It should be *possible* to run Bitcoin Core on any fully-functional hardware meeting the [minimum specs]( but on slow hardware the initial sync could take over a week to complete.
After the initial sync, the hardware doesn't matter all that much. But if you want to be especially helpful to the network:
* Make sure you forward port 8333.
* You want to have enough storage space so that you don't have to enable pruning. Currently you need about 80 GB, but this might increase to a few hundred GB within a year or two. (It's not necessary to store this much data to be a full node, only if you want to be an especially-helpful archival node. And there are plans to allow for partial archival nodes that help the network by storing just a portion of the full block chain.)
* Having a lot of upload bandwidth would be helpful.
* Being able to dedicate a few GB of memory to Bitcoin Core might make things easier.

One way to do it would be:
1. Print enough money to eliminate all debts.
2. Divide the government's total supply of gold by the total number of dollars in circulation, and say that each dollar is redeemable for that much gold. It'll be a very small amount of gold per dollar, but that's OK.
3. Add a constitutional amendment or something prohibiting the government from printing more money without acquiring more gold, and from disposing/encumbering any gold currently being used as backing.
This would cause a massive worldwide crash due to the initial hyperinflation, but after a few years it'd end up being a huge improvement, I think.

Yes. MW works by relying on properties of elliptic curves. If elliptic curves are insecure, which they definitely would be under QC, then MW can't work securely. Furthermore, while there are known QC-secure asymmetric crypto algorithms, these aren't elliptic curves, so MW can't use them. (Also, QC-secure asymmetric crypto is much less efficient than QC-insecure crypto, which is why it isn't used today.)
Maybe some new crypto can be figured out to get a similar effect in a QC-secure way, but nobody knows how this would be done as of yet.


Possibly, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it takes much longer than that. QC is one of those things where it's been thought to be right around the corner for many years. So far, only quantum computers with very tiny numbers of qubits have been created. Increasing the number is not just a simple problem of throwing more hardware at it, since the difficult part is figuring out how to get these quantum things to actually work together correctly. It *could* even be impossible, or so massively difficult that it won't be plausible for hundreds of years.
Though I'd have a hard time considering a MW altcoin to be "digital gold", knowing that QC could completely wipe it out at any time.

That's a description of how *mining* was originally meant to work. Mining is a small part of the Bitcoin system. Miners are employees of the network, not its rulers.


Policy changes and softforks don't need the sort of consensus I'm talking about.
@_date: 2016-01-31 03:03:00
BlueMatt's main goal in creating the relay network was I think to discourage "SPV mining" (with only some success...), not to prevent cartels.


* The current miners seem somewhat altruistic, and they also tend not to deviate much from Bitcoin Core's defaults. This is a situation which can't be relied upon.
* They haven't had much to gain from it so far. We're *not* using the OP's scheme, so when a block is rejected, it's rejected absolutely by everyone running a full node, which still seems to be a very significant section of the economy (and will hopefully remain so). Therefore, miners have a significant incentive to not break the rules. If everyone was running an SPV node, then the miner majority *would* have a strong incentive to break the rules to whatever extent allows them to extract as much value as they can from Bitcoin (and I very much doubt this would align with Bitcoin's principles or the desires of most Bitcoin users). The OP's proposal is similar, though in that case it's a *little* more difficult for miners because they have to work around the network issues, and they're also limited to messing with just the block size. On a somewhat separate subject, another situation in which miners could get something to gain from becoming a cartel is if they receive government pressure to do so: right now a handful of pool ops, all in the same country, could work together to instantly stop all Bitcoin transactions, or only allow transactions that are somehow "verified", for example.
* In some (but certainly not all) cases, pools which abuse their position might make less money, especially as time goes on and the subsidy gets replaced by transaction fees. If they abuse their position despite this, mining-hardware-owners may eventually move to different pools. Though hardware ownership has also become fairly centralized.
* If miners exploit their position to do great evil, the PoW algorithm will be changed. Though that'd be messy and dangerous, so it's very much a last resort (though all-powerful) defense against evil miners.

Yeah, that's probably what they'll end up doing, though I doubt they'll explicitly *say* that they're doing this. In the end it's probably even worse than a default, but it tricks people into thinking that they're not actually losing money. IMO the dollar is most likely to end in hyperinflation.

That's sort of independent of what I was talking about. A Sybil attack against a node is different from a Sybil attack aiming to collect full node rewards from some donators.
Bitcoin is more resistant than other P2P networks to Sybil attacks, but it's still possible for a powerful attacker to surround a node, and this is still very bad. It probably completely destroys privacy, the attacker can deny service, and if the attacker can generate a few blocks (even if they can only do it slowly), other attacks are possible.

It is, and there are SegWit transactions already, but this isn't one of them.

**Yes**, that's one of many pieces of bad advice floating around.
* Don't use a single-key paper wallet. There are no good tools for using them in even a half-reasonable way, leading to ridiculous stuff like creating transactions by hand, which even the top Bitcoin experts try really hard not to do with real BTC. They also encourage [address reuse]( which should be avoided whenever possible.
* Don't use JavaScript-based Web apps (bitaddress, etc.) to do crypto operations, even if the site says that everything is done client-side, and even if you download the page ahead of time. The provider of the site typically has many attack opportunities even if they say otherwise; JavaScript and Web browsers are notoriously insecure; and these sites are often half-baked, and not secure under scrutiny.
* Don't use your memory as the only place where keys are stored (ie. don't create a "brain wallet"). Except for some *very* rare circumstances, the risks outweigh the benefits. You're not as good at memorizing things as you think; every human is *terrible* at creating random passphrases; and all the password/passphrase creation advice you've ever heard is totally worthless due to the special considerations of this.
It *is* reasonable (and in fact a pretty good idea) to write down the several-word seed produced by an HD wallet such as Electrum onto paper and then put that paper in a safe deposit box or something. That's a sort of paper wallet, representing an infinite number of individual keys.

There's absolutely zero relationship between fractional reserve banking and sharding... Anyone would be free to download whatever extra blocks they want, and people would still *verify* everything - they just wouldn't typically store everything.
It's not necessary to expire UTXOs to allow the network to forget old blocks. See my comment [here]( ignoring the last point in the list. The downside is that forgetting old blocks reduces Bitcoin's security.
Expiring UTXOs would help reduce the size of the UTXO set (ie. the data that even pruned nodes need to store), but there's another proposal called *STXO commitments* which would limit the UTXO set in the same way without actually expiring any bitcoins.

This is similar to sidechains, plus some unnecessary disruption. The sidechain paper talks about a very similar method of gracefully making changes to Bitcoin. With sidechains the upgrade progression works like this:
1. Anyone can make a reduced-security sidechain, either SPV-secure or federated. Put whatever features you want on there. See if it works, is stable, and is popular.
2. Once the reduced-security sidechain is popular and seems safe, it can be converted into full Bitcoin security via a Bitcoin softfork. Then all Bitcoin full nodes need to also be full nodes on the sidechain.
3. Years later, you can simplify the system with a hardfork that removes the old chain and makes the sidechain the "main chain". UTXOs would be transferred so that no coins are destroyed. Since basically all economic activity is already on the sidechain, this hardfork would be totally uncontroversial.
(BTW, for those who aren't familiar with sidechains: Very roughly, a sidechain is like an altcoin with a guaranteed 1-to-1 exchange rate with Bitcoin. Think something like Litecoin, but set up such that you can always exchange 1 LTC for 1 BTC, 1 BTC for 1 LTC, and there are no other ways of creating LTC.)
I think that the above sidechain method would be an excellent way of making most changes. However, it's not suitable for doing 3GB blocks or whatever because *all full nodes still have to verify all sidechain blocks*.
Pair seems to have the misunderstanding that you could have something like a sidechain that is Bitcoin-secure but is only validated by a small number of full nodes. Under the standard Bitcoin cryptocurrency model, that isn't possible. If some full nodes validate the sidechain and apply the same principle as on Bitcoin where invalid blocks are absolutely rejected forever, then if a majority of miners fail to validate the sidechain at any point, a permanent split can develop between full nodes which validate the sidechain and those that don't.
If you want the sidechain to have full Bitcoin-level security, then at least the vast majority of the full-node economy needs to hard-verify the sidechain. If you don't want to require this, then *no* full node can hard-verify the sidechain or else you get a split possibility; the sidechain must be SPV-security or semi-centralized. So with sidechains (or anything *like* sidechains) you can pick only two of the following properties: fully decentralized; miners can't steal all sidechain funds; Bitcoin full nodes don't need to be full nodes on the sidechain as well.
Peter Todd has in the past proposed a totally different cryptocurrency model where miners do not validate transactions in blocks, and blocks are not assumed to contain only valid transactions. Miners can put whatever data they want in blocks, and they provide only timestamping. This is sufficient for a decentralized cryptocurrency to function, but it requires everyone to be a full node (or something similar to a full node) so that valid transactions can be distinguished from invalid nonsense in blocks. (I have an idea for something based on this which I might make a post about soon on bitcointalk.org, depending on the results of some block-chain stats that I'm gathering.)

Block chains are useful mainly for timestamping stuff in a way that is decentralized but universal, which is unrelated to mesh networking. For smart contracts, maybe a mesh network could use micropayment channels to pay for bandwidth.
I was just thinking yesterday that someone should work on mesh networking in China as a means to evade the great firewall. That's where this technology would have the most impact. I've also been thinking lately that for evading oppressive regimes, it may be most effective to change the whole model of the Internet/Web to rely on a distributed database like Freenet rather than point-to-point connections. Point-to-point connections have too many downsides: latency, intersection attacks, traffic flow analysis, DDoS attacks, etc.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:17:37
Yeah. I've always liked the idea of doing major innovations in a sidechain so that failures of the sidechain can't affect Bitcoin. And then when the sidechain becomes *very* solid, it can be made a required part of Bitcoin (this is a softfork). This could happen with Rootstock, for example.
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:06:07
There are many good reasons why they wouldn't. I think that Bitcoin would be very much a net positive for their economy, and even in the worst case (from their perspective) where an untouchable+untraceable black market develops, it doesn't seem very damaging to me. AFAIK, China doesn't have any income tax, so they might even have less reason to feel threatened by non-governmental money than other countries.
However, China does all sorts of things that seem self-defeating (as do other governments). I don't know what their overall economic theory / philosophy is, and I don't really understand their politics. If their only goal is to maintain their power, then IMO many of their decisions are poor ones, so probably the people in charge are either constrained by something or they are moved by some actual philosophy.

It lets you create an address (starting with 3) which can't spend coins sent to it for x days after the coins are received. This is useful in many cases. You can also combine it with other rules, so for example you could have an address that is normally a 2-of-3 multisig address, but times out to some backup rule x days after it receives any BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:57:53
Almost any change can be done as a softfork by creating a sidechain that all Bitcoin full nodes fully verify (as opposed to SPV-style sidechains or federated sidechains, which sidechain users don't verify), and then slowly moving the economy to the sidechain. Cross-chain transactions can be done automatically, since conversions happen at a guaranteed rate.
A lot of changes can also be done more elegantly than that, but I don't know of any other way to increase precision on-chain via softfork.
Though for something so uncontroversial and simple, I think that a hardfork on a several-year delay would be better, if possible.

* MW can't support advanced contracts. Sometimes you can replicate the effect of Bitcoin contracts with elliptic curve tricks, but not in all cases, and figuring out new MW pseudo-contracts is very difficult.
* MW will be completely wiped out by quantum computers, whereas Bitcoin has some innate quantum resistance and a clear path toward secure existence in a post-QC world. There's no known way of doing anything like MW without exposing it to quantum attacks, so if quantum computers come into existence, that'll be the end of MW (absent new crypto).
* Bitcoin has a very powerful existing ecosystem.
Also, MW doesn't *instantly solve* anonymity/fungibility. It needs to be paired with an effective, specially-designed mixnet-like network to do that, which will be an additional engineering challenge. Though there's been decades of research on mixnets, so MW won't have to start totally from scratch.
That said, a MW altcoin would be the first altcoin that would IMO have a chance of out-competing Bitcoin, since its disadvantages may be outweighed by its many powerful advantages. People who hold BTC should work hard to get it added to Bitcoin as a sidechain ASAP so that any altcoin version of MW doesn't have time to gain ground.

*If you use Liquid*, you have to trust a majority of the functionaries. Rather than a dollar backed by gold, it's more like the free-market private banknotes of the 19^th century, except made much more secure by exploiting Bitcoin's decentralized smart contracts such that *many* independent entities in different jurisdictions need to go evil in order to steal your money. If you don't like the backers, use a different sidechain or none at all.
When Liquid was released, *Bitcoin* didn't change. Liquid is an application built on top of Bitcoin smart-contract features which have existed forever. SegWit wasn't even necessary for it. Anyone could've made a similar sidechain, and anyone still can.
Liquid seems oriented toward transactions between exchanges; I'm not sure if ordinary people will be using it. I do like the idea of federated sidechains (they're less secure than LN, but far less complex in every way), but you shouldn't keep a ton of money on them at any one time, since they are absolutely less secure than Bitcoin proper or LN. `Bitcoin proper &gt; LN &gt;&gt;&gt; Federated sidechains &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fiat`.

Most altcoins are totally useless, and their market value is based mainly on pure speculation. By "pure speculation" I mean that very few people who own the altcoin actually expect the altcoin to take off in any real way, but are just trying to make money by trading more effectively than other speculators. You can't just copy-paste Bitcoin and expect your coin to get much value; Bitcoin has a very significant userbase and first-mover advantage, and any competitor must *greatly* improve on it to take any marketshare. Even if you took Bitcoin and made a few small changes that literally everyone agreed would be good, resulting in a clearly superior cryptocurrency, this wouldn't be enough to ever unseat Bitcoin because of Bitcoin's inertia.
A small few altcoins actually have useful features, or at least some *ideas* with merit, but none of the current ones are capable of competing with Bitcoin long-term. For example, if you created something exactly the same as Bitcoin but with Monero's anonymity, this might be enough to eventually out-compete Bitcoin. However, in reality, Monero and other CryptoNote cryptocurrencies achieve anonymity through a technique that is *extremely* inefficient; it doesn't scale well at all. If it ever acquired significant transaction volume, it'd either die or have to resort to a very dangerous level of centralization.
The useless altcoins often come up with gimmicks to make them seem like they have some actual usefulness, but almost always, these ideas are total nonsense. If the gimmicks do anything at all (which is not guaranteed), they'll work only through some sort of centralization (often obfuscated), or through a very fragile decentralized system that will fall apart as soon as anyone actually tries attacking it.
A Mimblewimble-based altcoin might be the first altcoin to actually have a chance of out-competing Bitcoin, since it improves both anonymity and scaling to a very large extent. It'd have a few disadvantages over Bitcoin, but perhaps these wouldn't be large enough to make much of a difference. Bitcoiners should seek to implement Mimblewimble in a sidechain before this becomes an actual threat.

All commonly-used asymmetric crypto (ie. crypto involving a separate public key and private key) is absolutely broken by quantum computing. All commonly-used symmetric crypto (ie. crypto involving only one key; and also cryptographic hash functions) is only somewhat weakened by QC, and typically remains secure in a post-quantum environment.
An address that has never been spent "from" is quantum-resistant because its public key is not known, only its public key hash. A public key involves asymmetric crypto, while the hash is symmetric crypto. Therefore, if you use each address only once, which is also the recommended practice for other reasons, you will be quantum-resistant overall.
There's no difference between old and new addresses. What you're probably thinking of is that for many years it used to be traditional for miners to send the block reward *directly* to a public key, with no address. This BTC is immediately vulnerable to QC in the same way that an already-used address is. Nowadays, miners typically send their block rewards to typical addresses. So, since a large percentage of 50-BTC block rewards are unspent (probably lost -- BTC was very cheap at the time), a lot of BTC is vulnerable to theft in case of QC.

Hm, it's not clear to me that there's a link between the currency-per-person idea and the labor theory of value. For example, I think that you could still reasonably do loans with interest, which is beyond the labor theory of value.
Though as I think about it more, I think back to what Satoshi said about how something like Bitcoin could become a currency: "If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it." If we lived in a world with the currency-per-person system, then if any fungible commodity somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then people would just find it more convenient to transfer that commodity rather than doing a bunch of currency conversions and loans and whatever in order to deal with the billions of per-person currencies. (Unless perhaps if the currency conversion network was set up to be *especially* convenient.)

Storage has basically already been solved. Bitcoin Core already supports pruning, which lets you discard the block chain after you download it. With pruning, you only need a few GB of space to run a full node. (There's no security penalty to this.) The remaining storage problems are: 1) Currently, the network wouldn't work if everyone enabled pruning; 2) full nodes still have to *download* all of the data, even if they can discard it; and 3) the UTXO set size can currently grow unbounded. But there are known solutions to all of these problems.
The real limiting factor is bandwidth and CPU usage when processing *new* blocks/transactions.

I think that it's possible, but I'm not sure that it'd provide much benefit. With the TPM as a second factor, the effect you'd get is that the passphrase would become locked to that computer. It wouldn't provide any protection against malware, since the TPM has no way of directly interacting with the user -- it can only trust that when the OS tells it to sign something, the OS is acting legitimately. All the TPM does in this scenario is keep the signing key itself secret. It'd be similar to the insecure BitFinex+BitGo multisig setup.

The way to read bitcoinfees.21.co is:
1. Ask yourself how many minutes you want to wait before you get 1 confirmation.
2. Find the first row with a number of minutes *less than* your target number of minutes in the rightmost column.
3. Take the sat/B number in the leftmost column of that row, and pay that fee, making sure to take your transaction size into account. (Bitcoin Core prefers to deal in BTC/kB, so divide the sat/B value by 100000 in that case.)
There's a bunch of spammy transactions being constantly sent right now which are driving the fee up. The required fee is about 2x what it normally is.

It does read to me like they want to send shareholders actual cryptocurrency transactions, but I just don't see how this is possible.


It's not as simple as "a fractional interest in the Bitcoin". Say that there is a fork of BTC called XBTC. Then the following events could happen:
* Xapo has 0 BTC.
* Authorized Participant (AP)  deposits 100 BTC, gets 1000 shares.
* AP2 deposits 50 BTC, gets 500 shares.
* XBTC forks from BTC.
* AP3 deposits 150 BTC mined after the fork, gets 1500 shares.
* Xapo now has 300 BTC and 150 XBTC.
Now consider two alternate scenarios. Scenario 1:
* AP4 acquires all 3000 shares on the market and redeems them for 300 BTC.
* If Xapo sends the BTC to AP4 in a single transaction (which presumably they would), then their wallet now contains 0 BTC, but also 150 XBTC because the transaction that Xapo just sent is valid on the Bitcoin network but invalid on the XBTC network. Now there's 150 XBTC floating around even though the Trust has 0 shares, which is a bit ridiculous.
Scenario 2:
* AP4 acquires 1500 shares on the market and redeems them for 150 BTC.
* If Xapo sends them the post-fork BTC, then AP4 gets no XBTC, and they therefore might get less value than they might expect. In fact, some of the shares acquired by AP4 might've come from the deposits of AP1 or AP2, which "should" be associated with some XBTC, but this isn't actually possible for exchanges to track AFAIK. If Xapo instead sends AP4 1500/3000 = 50% of all BTC and XBTC, so that AP4 gets 150 BTC and 75 XBTC, then in some senses AP1 &amp; AP2 are getting ripped off because their deposit produced XBTC while AP3's deposit did not, but yet AP1 &amp; AP2's shares are worth exactly the same as AP3's. (In this example, maybe most of AP4's shares were sold by AP3.)
It's a big mess, really. To avoid this mess, the Trust needs to get the altcoin out of its wallet as soon as possible, ideally before any share-fungibility issues arise.
If the Trust manages to take action before any post-fork deposits are made (like AP3's deposit in the above example), then Xapo can indeed just split the altcoins off and somehow distribute the value of these coins to the shareholders. If they had a cryptocurrency address associated with each share, they could send the altcoins directly to shareholders. But preventing post-fork deposits might not always be reasonably possible...

The term "Bitcoin relay network" can refer to two separate things:
* An open source protocol designed primarily by BlueMatt for very efficiently announcing blocks+transactions with the help of centralized servers.
* One specific network using this protocol run by BlueMatt, which most miners seem to use.
There is no "official" Bitcoin relay network. If any miners are unhappy with BlueMatt's network, then they can easily create their own. The relay network is very different from the Bitcoin network in that creating separate instances of it is especially easy, and doesn't require much coordination. If even just a pair of miners decide that they don't trust BlueMatt's relay network, they can set up a trusted server very close to both of them latency-wise and run a two-node relay network using that server. They can even do this in addition to BlueMatt's network if they want.

Some small amount of monetary inflation doesn't destroy a money's usefulness. Gold is probably the most popular money ever, and you can dig that stuff out of the ground. Suitable shells were probably rare enough that the inflation didn't cause major problems, even though I'm sure people did harvest shells directly. Nowadays it'd be different because businesses could probably do large-scale farming of the shells, etc.
In a decade or two, Bitcoin will probably be the least inflationary money ever, even moreso than gold, which is an interesting experiment. I personally think that this aspect will be good, and will make Bitcoin better money, but some others think that it will be detrimental to a greater or lesser degree. We'll see!

No. Some wallets do this, but it's insecure to just drop a transaction like that, since it may someday be confirmed even if the wallet stops attempting to send it, and then you could send twice the BTC you intended.
In Electrum, you should send the 0-conf BTC you received in a new transaction to yourself with a high fee. Then a miner will have to confirm both transactions in order to get the second transaction's fee. This is called *child-pays-for-parent* (CPFP).
I *think* that Electrum allows spending 0-conf BTC (some wallets don't), but some extra steps might be required. Maybe you have to enable it in the options. I can't give exact instructions.
If the Electrum wallet has had more than one incoming transaction in total, then you have to make sure that you're spending the UTXO (aka *coin*) that is currently 0-conf, and not just confirmed UTXOs. [This article might help you understand what I'm talking about](

Not as far as I know, but using Bitcoin's scripting system, you could design something especially good. For example:
TOALTSTACK 2 &lt;recipient public key&gt; FROMALTSTACK IF &lt;sender public key&gt; &lt;escrow public key&gt; 3 CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY ELSE NIP CHECKSIGVERIFY 0x403b54 CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY ENDIF
With this script (which is untested - I created it just now), there'd be four ways of spending the BTC secured by the escrow address:
* The sender and the recipient agree. (No dispute.)
* The recipient and the escrow agree. (Dispute decided in favor of recipient.)
* The sender and the escrow agree. (Dispute decided in favor of sender.)
* If 90 days pass from the time BTC was sent to the escrow address, the recipient gets the BTC. (Sender and escrow disappear.)
Furthermore, you can do some elliptic curve stuff to make it so that the escrow can't know that this transaction is even happening unless either the sender or the recipient brings it to their attention. This improves privacy.
So maybe the sender or recipient would subscribe to an escrow service, which would give them a public key. Then the sender and recipient would generate a shared secret, which they'd use to mangle the escrow public key so that one of them needs to give the shared secret to the escrow in order for the escrow to even know that their public key is used in the transaction (I *think* that this is possible). In case of a dispute, the sender would appeal to the escrow, who could decide in their favor, decide in the recipient's favor, or extend the time limit by working with the sender to send the BTC back to the same address. If there is no dispute, then the sender and recipient can cooperate to immediately unlock the BTC, or they can let it time out.
You could also modify it to involve multiple escrows.
This is all possible in Bitcoin today, but there's no wallet support for it. (Aside from messing with raw transactions, which a few wallets support.)

One way to prevent that is to store the majority of your bitcoins such that you require some data located in a safe deposit box in order to access them. This can be done using an encrypted paper wallet, 2-of-2 multisig, etc. (For particularly large amounts, you might want to do something more fancy in case the data in the bank safe is somehow lost.)
It's also possible to make stored bitcoins work a bit like a timed safe, where they can only be spent after some specific time. If your bitcoins are suitably anonymized, then someone is unlikely to attack you at exactly the required time.
And in general, anonymization is important so that people aren't able to target you. If you're attacked by some random thug, you can give him the small amount of BTC on your phone or whatever while your cold-storage BTC remains safe.
A 2-of-2 service such as GreenAddress can provide similar limited access as above without requiring manual wallet &amp; multisig management on your part, with perhaps slightly less security. (I don't think that GreenAddress actually provides advanced limited access features right now, though.)
Also, you should carry a firearm at all times.

The Bitcoin P2P network is not perfect. Sometimes, some part of the network will get a 0-conf transaction while other parts do not.

The probability of a single hash attempt solving a block is roughly `1/(difficulty * 2.32827*10^10)`. The constant there is roughly 2^256 / maxTarget, where maxTarget is a magic number in the definition of Bitcoin.

I tend to think that the current price is driven beyond sustainability by speculation, and it's likely to correct down to stability somewhere between $800 and $1000. There is some chance that the current rise is mostly based on actual long-term fundamentals such as reduced supply from the halving and world events, in which case the price could stay at this level or higher long-term, but IMO this is less likely. The recent jump was just *so* sudden.

If you have a significant amount of BTC, put Linux on an old computer and use it exclusively for Bitcoin. That'll reduce the malware risk; it's similar to a hardware wallet, though not quite as good.
Unfortunately, there aren't any great wallets yet. In particular, all wallets except Bitcoin Core have terrible privacy and sub-optimal anti-counterfeiting security (ie. it'd often be easy for an attacker to trick your wallet into thinking that you received BTC that you actually didn't). But Bitcoin Core is burdensome for most people to use, and even it is far from perfect on privacy.

Google Authenticator and its clones use the open-source TOTP protocol. You can use any TOTP app with any TOTP-supporting site such as Google. Everything these apps do should be totally local to the device; they shouldn't use the Internet at all.

Some say that, but I really don't see it. I mean, things would still be produced and consumed in the same ways. It's not like people are going to shut down their factories and burn their crops just because they don't have any usable money. People will quickly find a new money or else resort to barter. If there is a major collapse in manufacturing etc., it will almost certainly be due to the government creating barriers to adaptation such as price controls and regulations. If the government stays mostly out of the way, I think that we would not get anywhere close to starvation, at least, and probably economic growth would occur again within a few years.

Yes, but `gettransaction` only looks at wallet transactions. When Bitcoin Core sees a transaction related to a key in your wallet (including watch-only keys), it saves the transaction to your wallet.dat so you can use `gettransaction` etc. on it. If you're interested in *non-wallet* transactions, then you need pruning disabled, txindex=1, and then you need to use `getrawtransaction`.

* bc.i could say that you received bitcoins that don't actually exist, either maliciously, due to third-party interference, or due to a bug. You have no way of knowing.
* bc.i is notoriously unreliable. A bc.i bug [once caused bc.i users to lose a total of 800 BTC]( though luckily in *this case* the BTC was mostly returned by a white-hat hacker.
* Browsers themselves are notoriously insecure. A browser bug that breaks a browser's JavaScript isolation could allow other sites to interact with your bc.i wallet. Furthermore, doing transactions via a website makes phishing attacks easier -- most of the phishing spam I receive targets bc.i users.

Depends on how stupid the government will be. Ideally, those people would go into simple basic manufacturing, but currently they're prevented from doing so due to minimum wage and other labor laws. Also, consumer-protection laws prevent people from living on very low incomes because it's often illegal to sell very cheap, low-quality products.
The real solution in that situation is to remove all regulations and otherwise reduce government as much as possible. But there's a good chance that government &amp; the people will move in the opposite direction, which will just make things far worse. I'm not sure if crime will be the result, though.

If they wanted to do something actually useful, they could get rid of the block chain (which is just useless cost in a centralized system) and switch to a Chaumean e-cash system. This would allow for instant, very-low-fee transactions, and perfect privacy. You can also modify the scheme so that there's a key held by a government entity (maybe separate from the central bank) which can be used to identify the sender and recipient of a specific transaction.

I'm impressed that they considered this risk. This was one of my concerns with the COIN ETF, and I was considering submitting a comment to the SEC about it, though I never got around to it.
The way that GBTC proposes to handle it seems pretty good. It's similar to what I was going to recommend in my comment on COIN's SEC rule change. However, some small concerns still linger in my mind:
* If the fund manager mistimes the sell of the altcoin, GBTC investors could suffer unexpected losses.
* Someone could potentially create a fork of Bitcoin that has very low market cap. Anyone can hardfork Bitcoin from their perspective by just changing the code, after all. It's not clear at what point the fund would have to actively try to extract value from such spin-off altcoins. For example, the Clams altcoin could maybe be seen as merely a particularly complex hardfork of Bitcoin -- would GBTC need to try to recover and sell its Clams?
* In case the currency represented by the *Bitcoin* Investment Trust could potentially not be viewed as "Bitcoin" by some investors in the event of a currency split, I'd be a little worried about getting accused of fraud if I were them.
Maybe I'm overly paranoid about the above stuff. I'm not sure how much flexibility this kind of security typically has.
Thoughts on GBTC generally:
* I'm concerned that there's such a large spread between the market price and the theoretical NAV. This makes me think that their system of Authorized Participants isn't actually working well.
* I'm not convinced of Xapo's security. If I was considering investing in GBTC, I'd want to see a lot more info about their security practices first. If you look up their main office on Google Street View, it looks like a little unsecured building. They say, "The Custodian’s custodial operations maintain custody of the private keys that have been deposited in cold storage at its various vaulting premises across the United States, Europe, including Switzerland, and South America," but are these locations actually secure, or are they just hiring some random people? Is their procedure for issuing an order to sign a transaction secure? With BitGo+BitFinex, we clearly saw that it doesn't matter how secure some private key is if it'll just blindly sign whatever it's given.
* The 2% annual fee is pretty high. Maybe it's not totally unreasonable considering that physical gold storage is sometimes around that same level, and securing BTC is even more difficult, but it certainly doesn't look good to investors. And I feel that for 2%, the BTC should be 100% insured from theft or loss.

It's difficult to know in advance. See:  . Most transactions are about 250 bytes, but they can be much more if they have a lot of inputs.


This is an excellent idea. Good wallets will have you specify the fee in BTC/kB or whatever, and then they'll calculate the fee after they've actually created the transaction and know its size.
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:40:21
Ah, right, I remember commenting on that, but I didn't remember that you were part of the conversation.


I don't see how that's possible. Similarly to COIN and other ETFs, GBTC only deals directly with a small number of Authorized Participants (who will be banks, brokers, etc.). Only Authorized Participants can exchange between BTC and baskets of GBTC shares, but the Authorized Participants can then sell their shares to others, and these people can further sell their shares to others, etc. If GBTC wanted to distribute cryptocurrency to all shareholders, they'd have to make cryptocurrency distributions to a bunch of people who have never dealt directly with a cryptocurrency before. Furthermore, BTC deposited with GBTC can be non-fungible, but GBTC shares are fungible; for example, the following situation is possible: one Authorized Participant deposits BTC that is also usable in some altcoin, one Authorized Participant deposits BTC that was mined more recently and is therefore not usable in some altcoin, and a third Authorized Participant never deposits any BTC, but wants to exchange GBTC shares that they acquired on the market for BTC. Who gets the "altcoin-tained" BTC?
I think that they'd have to sell the altcoin on the market and then either make a USD capital gains distribution or use the proceeds to buy more BTC and increase the NAV.

Finally, some reasonable Bitcoin investment advice.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:40:00
You need to make sure that the second transaction actually spends the unconfirmed coins. Most wallets will actually try to *avoid* doing this by default because spending unconfirmed coins will cause the second transaction to get stuck until the original transaction is confirmed.
Basic intro to how Bitcoin transactions work: If you receive BTC in three separate transactions of (say) 1, 5, and 10 BTC, then you can think of your wallet as containing three gold coins with sizes 1, 5, and 10 BTC. If you then want to send 6 BTC, you can melt the 1 &amp; 5 BTC coins together and recast them as a 6 BTC coin, or melt the 10 BTC coin and recast a 6 BTC coin for the recipient and a 4 BTC coin as change for yourself. (Satoshi actually called these objects "coins", but today we usually call them UTXOs, unspent transaction outputs.) If you receive 1 BTC and it remains unconfirmed, then to do CPFP you need to spend exactly *this* "coin"/UTXO.
Exactly how you do this will vary by wallet. With Bitcoin Core you have to use the raw transactions API because the GUI doesn't let you send unconfirmed coins (except for change coins).
Also, you don't need to send the BTC between wallets. Sending to a different address in the same wallet is fine. The network can't see the difference.

It should be rare, but in LN edge cases (eg. a node disappearing or attempting fraud), you have to be able to get a transaction confirmed within the *expiration time* or else your BTC can be stolen. The expiration time can differ per channel, and LN wallets might let users tune it manually. A low expiration time means that in edge cases your BTC will not get locked up for too long, but you must be able to get the necessary transactions confirmed quickly. A high expiration time means that in edge cases your BTC could be tied up for days, but you'll have a long time to get the necessary transactions confirmed.
The counterparty node signs in advance the necessary transactions with an extremely high fee, so you don't have to worry about competing fee-wise with normal transactions. The concern is that if some massive LN node with a million open channels is hacked or something, and if all of those channels had an expiration time of 6 hours, then those channel-close transactions are not going to all get through in time, even with SegWit's 4MB block size, and BTC will be stolen. This sort of thing can be made easier if even a minority of evil miners cooperate, or if some miners are DDoSed.
It shouldn't be a problem if reasonable precautions are taken:
* Only put spending money into LN, not your life savings. (Mainly because the money might get *tied-up* for days. It's extremely unlikely that it'd be stolen.)
* If a node has tons of other users, pay a little more to use some other node.
* If you really want to use a huge node, set your channel expiration time to a very large value, like 30 days or something.

It was also possible to put a pushdata opcode right at the end of a scriptSig to turn the entire scriptPubKey into a constant (which evaluates to true), since the original method of execution was to concatenate the scriptSig and scriptPubKey before executing the combined script. And there were several other bugs/oddities in Script, such as the off-by-one in OP_CHECKMULTISIG which every multisig transaction still has to deal with today.
(ArtForz, who saved Bitcoin by privately reporting these bugs to Satoshi, is often forgotten because he retired from Bitcoin a long time ago, but he was very important to Bitcoin's early development for this and many other reasons.)
The rest of the code was pretty high-quality (contrary to what some people say), so it seems that Script was an afterthought which didn't receive the same thought/testing as everything else.

The main advantage is that they protect against malware. Even if you plug them into a computer that is completely controlled by an attacker, they shouldn't be able to steal all of your BTC. (Though maybe they'll be able to do things like convincing you that their address is someone else's, or trick your hardware/software wallet into thinking that you received BTC that you actually didn't.)


With all hardware wallets, it will force you to write down a several-word seed when first setting it up. You're supposed to put this seed in a safe deposit box or something. You can get your BTC with *either* (your device AND your few-digit PIN) OR your seed.


For most people with more than a few BTC, I think it's a good idea. One downside is that it's currently not easy to use a hardware wallet along with a full node, resulting in some privacy and security disadvantages.
If you don't want to get a dedicated hardware device, you get some of the same benefits by putting Linux on an old computer, installing some HD wallet, and using that computer purely for Bitcoin transactions. Malware is not impossible in this case, but it's massively less likely.

There are two reasons why that sort of thing isn't a good idea.
First, given an IP address, there's no way to verify that it's running a full node. Someone could set up one full node and then have thousands of different IP addresses pointing to it, making it look like they're running thousands of full nodes. It's possible to imagine various ways of trying to detect this, but I doubt there's any fool-proof way. People could even run nodes that behave in most ways like full nodes, but don't actually validate anything.
Second, even if you could make sure that you're only paying distinct, real full nodes, it's not a useful goal to try to increase the raw *number* of full nodes. When people are concerned about the falling number of full nodes, they're not really worried about a lack of network *capacity*: bandwidth, connection slots, etc. These resources have historically never been in short supply. The problem with the falling number of full nodes is that it signifies that verification is becoming more centralized: more people are doing their transactions via fully centralized wallets/APIs like BitGo, blockchain.info, Electrum, etc.; or by relying on the highly-centralized miners. What we need to increase is the amount of *real economic activity* that is done trustlessly through the participants' own independent full nodes. This isn't something that can be exactly measured, much less directly subsidized.

Usually, you can more-or-less just think of it as a transaction's signatures.
The term "witness" comes from mathematics &amp; theoretical computer science. Consider the following problem (the *subset sum problem*): given the numbers {-13661, -1021, 2980, 3041, 3271, 3747, 5144, 6873}, is there some combination of these numbers that will sum to zero? It's fairly easy in this small case, but for large sets of large numbers, even the most powerful of today's computers can't solve it; this is a hard problem. However, for many problems of this sort, someone can give you a small and easy-to-verify proof showing that the answer is "yes". This proof is called a *witness*. I can prove that the answer to the above example is *yes* with the witness `-13661 + 3041 + 3747 + 6873 = 0`, and you can easily verify it. Whereas if you didn't have this witness and had to start from scratch, it'd be more difficult, and in the case of large problems, intractable.
In Bitcoin, transaction validity depends on the execution of one or more Scripts per transaction. One way of looking at this is to say that each script needs to be executed, and if all Scripts associated with a transaction's inputs return true, then the transaction is valid (assuming it doesn't violate other rules). Another way of looking at it is as a decision problem like the subset sum problem above. We have a transaction and its associated prev-outs and we want to know whether it's valid: yes or no? The answer can be proven true by providing a witness, which in Bitcoin is usually one or more signatures along with some other data. Looking at it this way allows us to come to the important realization that it doesn't really matter what the witness is, as long as a valid one is provided. So there can be multiple valid witnesses floating around for a single transaction, and there's no problem with that, fundamentally. This is important for fixing malleability.
Looking at it this way also informs future improvements to the smart contract system of Bitcoin or potential future sidechains. If you want to create a fancy smart contract system, it's useful to realize that you don't necessarily need every node on the network to actually execute your script. Execution of scripts is merely a side-effect of the actual goal, which is to *decide* (yes or no) whether a transaction is valid. Using complex cryptography, it may be possible for the sender of a transaction to provide a witness that proves that his transaction is valid *without* requiring anyone else to actually run any script. The witness would merely prove that *somebody* ran the appropriate script, and that the script returned true.  [MAST]( is a concrete proposal for doing something a bit similar on Bitcoin, though less extreme (nodes would execute only *part* of scripts). It seems that MAST might be ready very soon after SegWit activates.

See 
The user experience would be roughly the same. I suppose that individual private keys which expert users might handle would probably be about 33 bytes (a 32-byte hash-tree root and 1 byte for the tree height). Addresses would be basically the same as now. You might be able to use your existing seed words, and there'd just be a slightly different way of deriving keys in the backend. The biggest end-user differences would be:
* Transaction signatures would be much larger (about 11kB per input), so on-chain transactions would be much more expensive.
* You wouldn't be able to infinitely reuse addresses. (You're already discouraged from doing so now, but post-QC it'd become *particularly* insecure.)
* All of your existing addresses would be more-or-less insecure, so you'd have to move all of your BTC off of those addresses into new addresses.
Despite how it's often portrayed, quantum computers powerful enough to endanger real-world crypto does *not* seem right around the corner. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still not a threat in even 50 years. So while it *could* happen sooner if there's a sudden breakthrough, and it's worth thinking about and preparing for to some extent, I wouldn't worry about it too much.

When looking at a single transaction in isolation, it's impossible to say whether it's sending to a SegWit address or not. Only once BTC sent to a SegWit address is *spent* will you know whether it was a SegWit address. For example, in a post which reached the front page recently, someone assumed that [this]( transaction was sending to a SegWit address, but once the first output was spent, it turned out that that output was multisig rather than SegWit, and the second output is as of this writing unspent, and therefore it can't be determined whether it's SegWit or not.
A fair bit into the future, a different address format will be used which will allow for immediate identification, but you should almost never see this anytime soon.
SegWit input scriptSigs will have one of these patterns:
* `0x160014&lt;20 bytes&gt;` (P2WPKH)
* `0x220020&lt;32 bytes&gt;` (P2WSH)
* Empty scriptSig (native SegWit, not normally seen currently)
Transactions can mix SegWit and non-SegWit inputs. Only the SegWit ones receive a [discount](

LN nodes aren't banks; they're basically untrusted. The risks are:
* The node could be spying on you.
* The node could censor certain transactions.
* The node could disappear, locking up your BTC for a while.
* If *tons* of people rely on a few nodes, and all of those nodes disappear at once, then there could be too many unilateral-close transactions to fit in Bitcoin blocks.
So your strategy when picking nodes will be:

It was thought that the expensive check for duplicate inputs was inefficiently and unnecessarily being done twice in 100% of cases, and so one of those checks was removed. However, it turned out that it was only being done twice in 99% of cases, so there were some cases where the only check for duplicate inputs was removed.

I don't know anything about this particular case, but Tor has always been really DDoS-weak (as I've [ranted about]( Each hidden service can have a maximum of 20 introduction points at any one time, which are ordinary publicly-usable Tor nodes already under load and possible to DDoS further. Even if you ignore that major bottleneck, there's no way for the application to *effectively* ban abusive clients, so an attacker can just keep creating thousands of new junk connections in order to overwhelm the application server. It's a more expensive attack than a non-Tor DDoS because each new connection involves a fair bit of crypto, but that's just a speedbump.
Tor desperately needs to add an adjustable proof-of-work to the protocol. Every public Tor node should require an adjustable-based-on-load PoW before accepting a relay request, and hidden services should be able to set an additional adjustable PoW for both their introduction points and their application servers. Moreover, when exiting to clearnet, it'd be nice if Tor could add a PoW header to the TCP header so that clearnet anti-DDoS systems don't have to assume that all Tor traffic is attacker traffic.
Distributed-data-store-based anonymity networks like Freenet are theoretically both much better at handling DDoS attacks and much more anonymous, though I don't trust any of the existing implementations much at all. I wish there was more work in this direction rather than Tor, which seems like a dead end IMO.

When a Bitcoin full node connects to a Bcash node, the Bitcoin node downloads Bcash headers (which are as of now still Bitcoin-valid), sees that it's a shorter chain, and then doesn't even bother downloading the full blocks. So it doesn't see that this chain is invalid.
I think that Bcash nodes should ban Bitcoin nodes after being connected for a while, but I haven't looked into it.

And once the subsidy ends and no new BTC is created, will the price of BTC be infinite? ;)
If there were no transaction fees, I'd expect the mining cost of producing 1 BTC to be around the same as the cost to buy 1 BTC, but this would be reached from the other direction: if miners aren't making enough money, the least efficient miners would drop out, and difficulty would drop, while if miners were making a ton of money, more competition would enter the market. I don't see much reason for the mining industry to influence the BTC price; similarly, the gold market usually isn't highly affected by the gold mining industry.

I've seen some people recommending that you mix coins by doing "BTC -&gt; ss.io -&gt; Monero -&gt; ss.io -&gt; BTC", but depending on how you do it, this can be a pretty poor method. Monero strongly encourages you to use a single stealth address, so assuming that Monero is a black box (which isn't *completely* accurate, though often close enough), from the perspective of shapeshift.io you'll see something like:
* 5 BTC -&gt; fixedMoneroAddress
* 10 BTC -&gt; fixedMoneroAddress
* 2 BTC -&gt; fixedMoneroAddress
* xx XMR -&gt; ~17 BTC to a new Bitcoin address
The first three are linkable *by shapeshift.io* (not on the Monero block chain) due to the Monero address reuse, and while the last may have plausible deniability, the amount creates a pretty clear linkage.
Additionally, if you're sending from the fixedMoneroAddress wallet, I think that within Monero itself you may reveal some info; if I understand Monero correctly, the last transaction in the example above will look something like:
* In 1: unknown amount
    * Prev-out 1 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 2 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 3 [known by ss.io to be 2 BTC -&gt; fixedMoneroAddress]
    * Prev-out 4 [decoy]
* In 2: unknown amount
    * Prev-out 1 [known by ss.io to be 5 BTC -&gt; fixedMoneroAddress]
    * Prev-out 2 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 3 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 4 [decoy]
* In 3: unknown amount
    * Prev-out 1 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 2 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 3 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 4 [known by ss.io to be 10 BTC -&gt; fixedMoneroAddress]
* Output: unknown amount [known by ss.io to be going to ss.io for ~17 BTC]
Although some plausibile deniability remains, it's very obvious to shapeshift.io what's happening here.
Monero really should not encourage people to reuse addresses.

You could *compute* every address that's been used, but Bitcoin doesn't actually use addresses internally, so you won't find any addresses via grep. You'd have to convert the address into its binary (not hex) hash160 and then search the blk****.dat files.

Ledger is mostly useless. It keeps the private keys secure, yes, but it blindly follows orders from the computer it's connected to. So if you connect it to a computer infected with malware, the malware can just tell the Ledger device, "Plz send all of your BTC to XYZ. I'm 100% legit, I promise."

1. Enable advanced mode to see scripts.
2. Look at the input scripts.
3. Understand that when bc.i says `PUSHDATA(22)[0014a4b4ca48de0b3fffc15404a1acdc8dbaae226955]`, it is annotating the serialized script `0x160014a4b4ca48de0b3fffc15404a1acdc8dbaae226955`, where 0x16 is a script opcode meaning "push 22 bytes".
4. Therefore, it matches my first pattern and is almost certainly a SegWit input. (To be 100% sure, you'd have to also check that previous output's scriptPubKey corresponds to the scriptSig. Each of the 4 SegWit scriptSig patterns has a corresponding scriptPubKey pattern.)
All of the standard SegWit patterns:
Pattern name | Address pattern | scriptSig | prev-out scriptPubKey

P2SH(WSH) | 3... | `0x220020&lt;32 bytes&gt;` | `0xA914&lt;20 bytes&gt;87`
P2WPKH | bc1... (short) | (empty) | `0x0014&lt;20 bytes&gt;`

An idea *called* Ripple existed, but it was different from the current altcoin. The old Ripple worked like this: each user would manually say, "I'm willing to loan Alice x tokens, Bob y tokens, Carol z tokens, ...". Everyone would do this, forming a trust network. Then, assuming the trust graph was globally connected, you could send money by sending an IOU to someone who trusts you, who would send an IOU to someone who trusts them, and so on over multiple steps until the recipient receives an IOU from someone who they trust, completing the transfer. This could be done with a new currency or (probably more usefully) with an underlying asset such as BTC or gold which could occasionally be used to actually settle the Ripple loans, though settlement would only rarely be necessary. The reason that this idea doesn't require mining is that it is able to function without a single global view of anything; each person is only concerned with his own loans and trust. The downside of this system is that it is possible for the trust graph to not be connected, in which case some transactions would be impossible, and it is also possible for people to assign trust *incorrectly* and lose money from defaulted Ripple loans. (Notice that this is very similar to Lightning, though in Lightning the "loans" are sort-of 100% collateralized so that they can't actually be defaulted on.)
The creator of the original Ripple idea sold the name to someone else who created the almost-entirely-unrelated modern scamcoin Ripple. For a very brief period of time modern-Ripple tried to live up to the original idea to some degree, but in their efforts to maximize ease-of-use, ensure a single global view of the Ripple ledger, and give XRPs value, it is now a 100% centralized system no better than PayPal, and with virtually nothing left over from the original idea.

Remember a few weeks ago when everyone was warned to stop transacting? That is very far from something that a stable system would do.
It's also sort of traditional. The Bitcoin Core philosophy is to be as secure/prudent/conservative as possible. It tells you something important when you see BlackCoin, zcash, BU, btc1, etc. copy the Core code and immediately slap a 1.0 on it as one of their first changes. Core values technical excellence; most "competition" just wants to get-rich-quick on a pump-and-dump, and so they are quick to sweep any risks/problems under the rug for the sake of a small marketing boost. This sort of thing sets the tone for the respective projects.
Once you can say with confidence that Bitcoin will be functioning fine for the next several years, with no need for any softforks/hardforks, then 1.0 is possible. It'll happen decades from now, if ever.

Yeah, although there's hope that it'll be possible to make LN a pretty flat mesh network, IMO it's quite likely that the economics will lead to a fair bit of centralization. But it's critically important to realize that this is not *forced* centralization. If you're worried that an unsafe number of people are routing through some LN node, then you can blacklist that node and tell other people to do the same. Complaining about LN centralization is like complaining that email is centralized because tons of people use Gmail. If you don't like it, then don't use Gmail; Gmail's existence doesn't affect you if you don't use it. Or like Tor, where if you think that if one of the Tor nodes is a honeypot, then you can configure Tor not to use it. People who complain about potential LN centralization must be thinking that there's going to be some set of "approved LN hubs", but that's totally wrong; you will use exactly the LN nodes that you *choose* to use.

There used to be a key that allowed only *messages* to be sent to users of Bitcoin Core for the purpose of alerting them of critical updates and so forth, and Gavin was one of several people with this key, but this feature was removed. It does not exist in the most recent versions of Bitcoin Core, and it never allowed any sort of control over the Bitcoin currency. Full node software such as Bitcoin Core will *never under any circumstances* accept an invalid block or transaction, even if every other person in the world signs off on it; this absolute absence of trust is a cornerstone of Bitcoin.

If that was the case, then everything else should also be increasing in value. You'd basically expect the price of bread to go "to the moon" in the same way as BTC if it was hyperinflation.
I have a theory that most of the money being printed goes to banks and institutional investors who end up just bouncing it around on the stock and bond markets amongst each other, and since the money isn't used for any *real* economic activity, price inflation is avoided. So you end up with a ponzi-scheme-type thing where stock prices are artificially super-inflated, and could stay that way for a long time, but if there was ever a massive "bank run" on the stock market, this could lead to actual hyperinflation. I suppose it's possible that this money is also being dumped into BTC now, though I don't see any particular evidence for that.

The way that Bitcoin transactions work is complex. There are usually very good reasons for why Bitcoin works the way it does, but most people don't find it intuitive. If you don't have a very good understanding of Bitcoin transactions and you try to create a transaction more-or-less by hand, then massive overpayment of fees is one of the easiest mistakes to make. I think that this is often done by people using single-key brainwallets, which is *very strongly discouraged* for this and other reasons. You should basically never deal with individual Bitcoin private keys.
Each Bitcoin transaction redeems some coins ([see here for what I mean by "coin"]( and then mints some new coins for the recipients. Any value from the input coins that is not used for output coins is *implicitly* a transaction fee; there is no "fee" field in Bitcoin transactions. People who don't understand Bitcoin often have the incorrect idea that Bitcoin works based on *balances*, so when (for some stupid reason) they're put in the position of creating a transaction by hand, they'll make this kind of mistake: Bob receives 1 BTC on address A. Bob creates a transaction by hand spending "from" address A, sending 0.5 BTC to address B. Bob incorrectly thinks that Bitcoin works based on balances, so he expects 0.5 BTC to be "debited from" address A's 1 BTC total. But Bitcoin does *not* work based on balances; what actually happens is that the entire 1-BTC coin is redeemed, a 0.5 BTC coin is minted, and the remaining 0.5 BTC is a fee.

The problem is that with a brokerage firm, the 1099-B mainly reflects securities that were both purchased and sold within the same brokerage firm. While possible, it is uncommon to transfer securities from one brokerage firm to another, preserving the cost basis. But this is extremely common with Bitcoin. So unless someone is using Coinbase *only* to speculate on the Bitcoin price, and never actually uses the BTC, any gains reported on a 1099-B generated by Coinbase will be wrong. And it could be wrong in either direction: either under-reporting gains or over-reporting gains.

It'd be nice if there were detailed instructions for all wallets, maybe also including pictures in some cases. Please add to the page if you can. (If you need to have your wiki account activated, go to  on Freenode.)
You might notice that these instructions are *extraordinarily complicated*, which is because most wallets handle this stuff very poorly. Eventually, wallets really need to become good enough that there's no need for a page like this.

That's standard behavior for Bitcoin banks. When it gives you a receiving address, any BTC sent to the address will be assigned to your account (usually even if you reuse the address, though this is not *guaranteed* in general). But when you send BTC, any BTC controlled by the bank can be used. It's *possible* to completely segregate BTC so that you'd see the behavior you're expecting, but this makes things more complex and can significantly increase total transaction fees.

SegWit transactions are not smaller; that's a common misconception. They just use different size accounting. SegWit replaces the concept of max block size with a *max block weight* of 4MB, where non-witness bytes and non-SegWit witness bytes count as 4 bytes, and SegWit witness bytes count as 1 byte. A 300-byte transaction is still 300 bytes on-disk and on-wire, though it will be *counted* as more than 300 bytes purely for purposes of the 4MB weight limit. (The 1MB max block size no longer exists under SegWit; a SegWit block can be nearly 4MB in size. And this is real size in every way.)
It's the "from" side that matters. When BTC is sent to a SegWit address, whenever that particular BTC is spent in the future, that part of the spend will have the SegWit discount. If you send a transaction spending some SegWit-secured BTC and some pre-SegWit BTC, then *part* of the transaction's witness data will receive the discount. The destination of the transaction doesn't matter in any case.
Furthermore, a transaction is immune to malleability only if all of its inputs are SegWit inputs. And the destination doesn't matter there, either.

How most HD wallets work is that they take (or generate) a mnemonic, the mnemonic is used to generate the HD wallet master key, and the master key is used to generate the keys in the wallet. Bitcoin Core doesn't yet support the first part of that: it generates a random *master key* without using a mnemonic. So there is no mnemonic.
The master key is saved in wallet.dat, and I believe it is also exported in the human-readable output of the `dumpwallet` command (Help -&gt; Debug window -&gt; console -&gt; type `help dumpwallet` for more info).

First, note that most of the positive respondents there are posters pretending to be hearing this for the first time, even though this is an old copypasta which pretty much everyone will have seen.


Wrong. bitcoin.org is ultimately controlled by Cobra, who was given it by Sirius, who was given it by Satoshi. The bitcointalk.org domain name is similarly controlled by Cobra, while I administrate the site.


It was put in place *by Satoshi* because the software clearly couldn't handle it. There were no tx spam attacks occurring at the time. In fact, we now know that Satoshi's original software couldn't handle even 1MB blocks. This caused the BIP50 incident, where nodes running the older database code written by Satoshi started randomly failing once miners started creating larger blocks. Satoshi's original software had soft limits which made it never produce blocks over 500kB, and very rarely over 250kB.


Wrong. The very first versions set aside some portion of blocks for free transactions. If that was full, then they started requiring fees. The fee logic worked much the same as today's code; it's just that free transactions were *sometimes* possible/allowed because there was essentially no tx volume. The same situation exists today on most altcoins.


Gavin had already resigned as Bitcoin Core lead dev at that point, and had not contributed in any significant way to Bitcoin Core for about a year.
XT had very little support.


If you want to use this ridiculous feudalism argument, I can "draw authority from Satoshi" in four separate ways: as bitcointalk.org head admin (originally Satoshi), as owner of bitcoins.org/bitcoin.net (originally owned by Satoshi), as one of the old alert key trustees (originally created by Satoshi), and as the backup domain administrator of bitcoin.org (originally owned by Satoshi). Gavin on the other hand voluntarily resigned as Bitcoin Core lead developer in favor of Wladimir.
(The above is not a good argument; I don't use it except in response to similar arguments.)


Gavin's original solution, which was to push through 20MB block sizes ASAP, was later shown in research *by bigblockers* to have been unsafe.


More like **almost all experts**.


This has never been a concern of mine -- I believe that mining is already hopelessly centralized and beyond saving --, and it's at most a tangential concern of other decentralists.


Absolutely false. All developers who worked for Blockstream rejected 20MB blocks, just like all developers who worked for Blockstream would've rejected the idea that the sky is green. But Blockstream employees are only a small percentage of Bitcoin Core devs, and almost all Bitcoin Core devs as well as almost all experts opposed Gavin's ridiculous 20MB proposal and the later still-ridiculous 10MB and 8MB proposals.


With Gavin's original proposal of 20MB blocks, the block chain would grow by up to ~1TB per year.
But storage is generally a straw-man argument -- due to pruning, storage is *mostly* solved, and has been for years. Storage is way down on the list of concerns for large block sizes. See my post [here]( for the actual concerns. (Back in 2014-2015, bandwidth was also a very major concern, but since then compact blocks -- roughly the same thing as IBLTs mentioned by Gavin -- have been added to Core, improving this a lot.)


This agreement was between some miners and a handful of notable devs: Peter Todd, Luke-Jr, BlueMatt, and Adam Back IIRC. Those people were only representing themselves, not anyone else, and this was made extremely clear in the agreement. Even if they had been representing Blockstream or Bitcoin Core as a whole, a little group of people like this can't make decisions on behalf of Bitcoin.




Funny how the Bitcoin Core lead developer works for MIT, then.
In reality, only a few Bitcoin Core devs are Blockstream employees.


I recently [warned against trusting any organization]( as every organization will eventually be corrupted. I owe no allegiance to Core or Blockstream (which is separate from Core); I *support good ideas*.
Regarding moderation: my position has always been that if you don't like how we do it, then you can leave. We try to make as good as possible in spite of Reddit's many inherent flaws, but it's not going to please everyone. To make a large subreddit useful, aggressive moderation is sometimes necessary, but we've never taken the position of banning all bigblockers or anything like that. When people get banned, it's usually for behaving in a way that would get you banned on a great many other subreddits.
We **do not** allow the dangerous and deceptive practice of trying to get people to run non-consensus software. Some may have noticed that we banned links to binaries of BIP148, since that was non-consensus software, even though I mostly agreed with what BIP148 was trying to do. If you don't agree with this policy, again, you're free to leave.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:10:25
Awesome! I'm surprised, but I guess BIP148 was much more effective than I'd expected.
SegWit actually activates about 2 weeks after it officially reaches the locked-in state in a couple days. After that, it will be possible to use SegWit, but each wallet software will need to upgrade in order to do so. You can only use the extra block space if you are *spending* one or more outputs that was sent to a SegWit address created by a SegWit-compatible wallet. Similarly, a transaction is only immune from malleability if all of its inputs are spending BTC sent to SegWit addresses. SegWit addresses are indistinguishable from other addresses starting with 3, but they have to be created specially -- none of your existing addresses will ever be SegWit addresses. Even if you're not personally using the extra block space, though, space should be cleared for you once other people start doing so.

In the future, you could back up the blocks and chainstate directories periodically. Then if your database gets corrupted, you can replace them to avoid having to start completely from scratch.
If you have enough memory for it, increasing the `dbcache` setting can significantly speed up syncing time. Using an SSD instead of a magnetic drive is also a big help -- it *might* even help to put the pruned data directory on a 8+ GB USB flash drive, though I haven't actually benchmarked this. Under perfect conditions, a full sync can take as little as 8 hours.

While much worse than Bitcoin, I'd actually think that something like the system proposed in the Bordo-Levin paper would be better than the existing fiat monetary systems, *except* that this sort of government digital currency would clearly be used to track everyone's activities, enforce negative interest rates with no escape, freeze people's assets, and other such evil. (I also see several other problems in the paper, such as using GDP and chained CPI in their benchmark: both inherently pro-government/pro-inflation metrics.)
Maybe I could be somewhat supportive of one of these government digital currencies if they used Chaum blind signing with no backdoor, ensuring a level of untraceability and fungibility similar to cash. But there's basically no chance of that happening...

Yes. The simplest version would be to just add a couple lines to CheckBlock:
    if (current_time &gt; FORCE_SOFTFORK_TIME &amp;&amp; !hasSegWitBIP9Bit(block))
        return false;
But the miners involved would have to make sure that they actually represent a majority of mining power; otherwise they'd be likely to create blocks on a shorter chain without actually activating SegWit, and they'd lose a lot of money.
As a transitional step, miners could discourage non-SegWit blocks in various ways. For example, they could delay building on top of non-SegWit blocks for 30-60 extra seconds. This would significantly increase the orphan rate for non-SegWit miners, which could get them to upgrade, and would also end up increasing the signalling percentage by perhaps 5% or more due to disadvantaging non-SegWit miners. This change would require more code than is immediately obvious, since there are several edge cases to consider.


You're using the word "consensus" incorrectly. See  for the word's several definitions, none of which have anything to do with mining or an absolute majority.
A miner-initiated softfork requires a majority of mining power as well as general agreement in the Bitcoin ecosystem. (There's another type of softfork that doesn't require any miner cooperation, but it ends up working more like a hardfork.) The reason that activation thresholds above 51% are used is that these thresholds are based on what miners *say* they're going to do, and what they'll *actually* do can't be determined. For example, there was a softfork in the past in which more than 75% of miners signaled support, but only slightly more than 51% actually did support the softfork. If even more miners had lied in this case, then the Bitcoin network/currency would've split in two, which would've been a huge mess. This is a big part of why the threshold was increased to 95% from 75%. But if miners are *actively* rejecting blocks that don't signal readiness for the softfork, then it becomes a lot more clear that they're accurately signalling readiness themselves.
A higher threshold is also better because post-softfork, fewer invalid blocks will be produced. If you have a 51-49 miner split post-softfork, then it'd be quite common for un-upgraded and lightweight nodes to see a transaction of theirs get several confirmations (even 6+, sometimes) and then drop back down to 0 after a reorg (from their perspective).

See the article I wrote on the wiki: 
Your scenario is *possible*, but IMO the major powers are happy with how the middle eastern conflict is a proxy battle between them without much potential for significant, long-lasting damage to themselves. I think that all sides would resist strongly the usage of nuclear weapons there.


Even in a high-radiation environment, most people in the world as a whole don't live long enough to die of cancer. According to WHO 2000-2016 data, 9% of people died of cancer worldwide. Radioactive fallout would be dangerous for a few weeks due to *radiation poisoning*, some people would die of cancer in the short-term, and average lifespans might go down by some years, but an increase from 9% to 67% seems very unlikely.
If the governments of the world start to look unstable, maybe BTC could become an alternative to their currencies. But if the Internet isn't working well, or if it seems possible that it might in the future not work well, then it'd make more sense to store wealth in things that you can touch (eg. precious metals, shelf-stable food, ammunition, etc.). I think in your scenario people would be terrified of a more expansive nuclear war, and BTC would not look at all attractive.

No, you're unlikely to ever see "proper" balances when looking at block explorer sites and trying to cross-reference with Coinbase and other Bitcoin banks. As my second link explains, the idea of BTC being sent "from" an address is simply not a reliable concept.
When you bought BTC on Coinbase, they just changed some numbers in their database, moving BTC from one account to your account. There was no block-chain transaction. Whenever you send BTC from Coinbase, they will similarly just adjust some numbers in their private database to subtract those bitcoins from your Coinbase account, and then the actual Bitcoin transaction will draw on coins from *anywhere* in Coinbase's hot wallet -- the "from address" will probably be totally unrelated to you. It'll be this way regardless of how the BTC ended up credited to your Coinbase account.

UBI is bad, like any welfare program. However, I think that it would be a large improvement if UBI allowed for the removal of *all* government welfare and work-related regulations. It's been calculated that this would reduce overall welfare expenditures in the US, and I think that it'd remove a lot of perverse incentives of the welfare system. For example, people on welfare often end up trapped there because it would be financially insane for them to start working and lose their welfare. UBI resolves this. It also requires much less government in order to administer UBI as opposed to welfare programs.
Similarly, taxation is theft, but I think that a uniform sales tax or property tax would be better than an income tax because it'd significantly reduce government size/intrusiveness, as well as having some economic advantages.
Whether any of this is politically possible, I'm not so sure. It seems quite possible that if UBI was ever adopted in the US, we'd end up with UBI *plus* a bunch of additional welfare stuff, which is just the worst of both worlds. In particular, I think that people would continue to get hung up over the health care issue. In any private health care system, the amount of health care a single person can receive is limited; most people *imagine* that if government takes over health care, then any unhealthy person will have access to *unlimited* resources, when in reality it just leads to across-the-board rationing and reduction in quality.

That's because Bitcoin Core hasn't added wallet support for SegWit yet, so the altcoins have nothing to copy/paste.
After SegWit activates, wallet support will be added to the next version of Bitcoin Core. Then people who upgrade will send/receive SegWit transactions by default (though with full backward-compatibility), allowing them to access the 4MB of block weight provided by SegWit. So yes, it will be used.

If the second transaction depends on the first, then a miner can't include the second transaction and get its fee without including the first transaction. So it's economically rational for miners to consider the fee per kB of entire *chains* of unconfirmed transactions rather than just the first or last transaction in an unconfirmed transaction chain. For example, if you have TxA -&gt; TxB -&gt; TxC, a rational miner would (more-or-less) treat all of these transactions like a single transaction with size size(TxA)+size(TxB)+size(TxC) and fee fee(TxA)+fee(TxB)+fee(TxC); therefore, TxA and TxB could even have *zero* fee if TxC had a huge fee. Miners would also need to consider whether including TxA alone or TxA -&gt; TxB would be better -- they need to include all ancestors of a transaction, but not all of its children.
Bitcoin Core's block creation, used by most miners, takes this into consideration by default, considering by default unconfirmed transaction chains up to 25 transactions long. It's called *child-pays-for-parent* (CPFP).

Long-term, I expect that even full nodes will only download and verify the last few years of the block chain. This is only a tiny reduction in security, since an attacker would have to regenerate years' worth of blocks, and it'd only affect a small number of people who are doing their initial sync before news of this attack becomes widely known. Furthermore, I expect:
* Pruning (which Bitcoin Core already supports) will allow nodes to discard almost all of the block chain data after they've downloaded and verified it, without any reduction in security. The storage requirements are currently only a few GB, and should grow slowly.
* Pruned nodes need to download block chain data from somewhere. Currently, the network requires that a lot of people keep copies of the entire block chain for this purpose. In the future, storage of the block chain will be sharded so that each node will only store a percentage of the entire block chain, and syncing nodes will download it in a way similar to how a BitTorrent swarm works. This will allow pretty much every node to enable pruning.
* Support will be added for full nodes to sync backward instead of forward. So there'll be no need to wait for your full node to sync before using it, and you'll have *nearly* the same level of security as a real full node after only a couple hours.
So while the full block chain will likely grow to enormous size, and some archival nodes might choose to store the whole thing, in practice I expect it to not be a big issue.

That's from Satoshi. Bitcoin 0.1 used the file `wallet.dat`, and the code talked about "wallet transactions" and such. Possibly he got the term from earlier cryptocurrency work (which dates back to the 1980s), though I'm not aware of specific examples.

You could accept BTC directly and then periodically sell it. There's more currency risk with this, of course, but it gets rid of the annoying middleman between you and your customers entirely.
It'd be cool if someone created software that worked exactly like BitPay, but:
* You'd run the software yourself.
* You'd collect and hold the BTC yourself, removing the middleman.
* When you accept payment, the software would automatically buy a put option on some (configurable) exchange, removing the currency risk.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:20:10
You need to spend the coins that are currently unconfirmed and pay a high fee, maybe double the normal fee. Since miners need to confirm the first transaction in order to collect the fee from the second transaction, they'll mine both at once (if they have the CPFP patch, which I think only a small handful of pools are using).

Satoshi never specified. Someone just made up those kanji, and then people started running with it. Probably it'd be most correct to spell it with katakana.
You can also have fun picking kanji with compatible readings but interesting meanings; for example, I've suggested 里, which has "satoshi" as a very obscure reading, as a symbol for the [satoshi]( unit, since it's easy to write and also appears as a radical in 理 (logic/reason), which itself also has the obscure reading "satoshi".

My previous comment was referring to the thought-process of those bigblockers who actually have an ideology. More cynically/realistically, they want to hijack the name "Bitcoin", but they need some *excuse* to have any success with that. You can see with Bcash that basically nobody is considering Bcash to be anything other than an altcoin, even though on a technical level it's not much different from a hypothetical consensus hardfork, since Bcash doesn't have a good excuse for hijacking the name.

It was a standard speculative bubble. Speculators were worried that it would go to $2000 or something, and they didn't want to miss out, so they kept buying. Once the upward trend started to become shaky, these and other speculators got the reverse idea, that the price would drop to $700 or something and they'd be left holding very-overpriced BTC, so they rushed to sell to either lock in their profit or limit their losses. This kind of thing happens all the time, and not just in Bitcoin.
When you see a near-vertical line on the price chart and everyone starts talking about how we're all going to be billionaires soon, a big crash is usually coming. Growth that lasts usually happens more gradually. It's not *impossible* for a huge jump to last, especially if there are major changes in the fundamentals, but it's awfully rare.
Notice that the price is still above where it was before the jump, just quite a bit below the all-time high. That's a common pattern: big jumps or dips along a longer-term trendline. (Though *sometimes* a big jump or dip will end up reversing the longer-term trend. If you want to guess where the market is going, then you're speculating, and it's risky.)

It strikes me as very unlikely that Bitcoin will ever *reliably* increase in value by 10%/year in real terms, such that everyone *knows* that if you just hodl your BTC, then you will every year become ~10% richer by every measure. Nothing behaves like that.
Instead, it'll probably be either a far smaller reliable increase, or (more likely) high volatility. In the former case, the real interest rate doesn't increase too much. In the latter case, the borrower should buy an option contract insuring against price increases above a certain level. (In *ultra-high* volatility such as exists currently, appropriate option contracts would be too expensive to make lending reasonable, which makes sense.)
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:48:07


The main motivation is to maintain decentralization. If 10 MB blocks were just as expensive for full nodes as 1 MB blocks, then I suspect that there wouldn't be all that much resistance to it. But the fact is that 10 MB blocks would push out almost all full nodes, making Bitcoin very centralized and insecure. (Also, various parts of the network/software would break down under such large blocks.) Keeping the miner reward reasonably high is important, but it's not an imminent issue because even a subsidy of 12.5 BTC is still pretty high.
Also, it's important to realize that "small-blockers" (I prefer the term "decentralists") don't support 1 MB blocks forever, and in fact SegWit is the same as increasing the max block size in basically every way.

Oh, I see that you're the person with whom I've discussed this stuff before.
It will be a standard ETF with APs:


Also, even APs will not be able to redeem/deposit BTC:


So APs would give the ETF cash, the ETF would give the cash to its Subsidary, and the Subsidary would (eventually) use the cash to buy BTC futures contracts. At no point does the ETF or its Subsidiary hold any actual BTC.
It seems that they'll usually hold 25% of their assets in pseudo-BTC via futures contracts owned and traded by their Subsidiary, and put the remaining 75% in Treasury securities. It's not clear to me how the futures will work, though. AFAIK, there is not quite yet any public futures market for BTC, so the Subsidary might have to make OTC deals with one or more different counterparties directly. (Though it looks like the Subsidary can fall back to buying things like GBTC shares if its primary strategy of trading derivatives fails.) It seems that neither the fund itself nor its Subsidiary will touch BTC directly at any point, so the trustworthiness/security of the derivative counterparties (and/or the exchange, if one is used) will be the main factor in the fund's overall security. But not much about this is mentioned in the prospectus.
This document's summary of Bitcoin is somewhat better than the previous ETF applications I've seen, but it's less detailed. And it's basically saying, "We want to avoid US securities regulation, so we're just going to do this weird pass-through thing via a Subsidiary in the Cayman Islands." That's fine with *me*, though if the SEC approves this one but not the previous ETFs that don't do this, it'll be funny.

I don't know of any good single source, but it's been heavily discussed since the original sidechain paper in 2014. Although it's only briefly mentioned in the paper, one of the main use-cases for sidechains is that you'd do some crazy experimental thing on an SPV-security or federated sidechain -- confidential transactions, say --, and then once this sidechain has been proven stable, secure, and popular after a couple years, you can do a Bitcoin softfork to upgrade it from reduced security to full Bitcoin-security by having all full nodes hard-enforce the sidechain's rules rather than trusting miners or functionaries. (You can also skip the SPV-security/federated phase if you want.)
IIRC this was discussed in one of the talks at the first Scaling Bitcoin conference, but I didn't check.
Sidechains are like extensions onto Bitcoin blocks. After 20 years, a typical Bitcoin block could consist of a 2009-format block with just the coinbase transaction, plus a 2018-format sidechain block with another coinbase transaction and a few remaining other transactions, plus the then-current 2030-format sidechain block containing all of the normal transactions, built on top of the 2018-format sidechain. You could still spend never-spent BTC mined in 2009 by passing it through the 2018 sidechain on your way to the 2030 sidechain, and you can also move BTC in the other direction. Each block has its own coinbase transaction, but only for collecting fees on all sidechains: the subsidy can only be claimed once, of course. When a block is mined, it's mined on all sidechains at once.
After several years, a hardfork could remove the unused layers described above (without destroying any funds) in order to reduce complexity and overhead, but it's not a big deal.
Note that although you can increase the max block size this way, it doesn't offer any *scaling* benefits compared to a hardfork max-block-size increase, since all Bitcoin full nodes still need to process the sidechain blocks. It is good that it's a softfork, so once it's determined that an increase is safe, this may be a good way to do it, especially if we're in a hurry, since an ideally-safe hardfork needs *at least* a year of time-delay.

The paper was released some time before the software was released. While version 0.1 did have support for addresses, I and others have speculated that addresses and the scripting system were late additions to Bitcoin: at first, Satoshi intended payments to be done using a system similar to the current Bitcoin Payment Protocol (his system, in old versions of the software but no longer used today, was called "pay to IP address"). But I suspect he realized that the requirement that the recipient be online was too annoying.
That's probably why the paper talks only about public keys, not scripts or addresses, which are today very important aspects of the overall Bitcoin system.


Most people are surprised to learn that the term "mining" was not regularly used until after Satoshi left. Satoshi called this process "generating", and the people who did it "generators". (As in *generating* blocks and BTC.)


Satoshi always said "block chain" (two words), never blockchain. I still use this style, since "blockchain" makes it sound more like a company (maybe blockchain.info in particular) rather than a technology.


0.1 actually did use the longest chain of blocks, ignoring work. This was corrected by Satoshi in a later version.


Yes, pools completely caught him by surprise, I think. Somewhat later on he did mention GPUs, hoping that they would not become widespread too soon. But at the time of the paper I'm not sure he realized that GPUs would have a big advantage. And he never mentioned ASICs.


A bit of terminology: When Satoshi says "coin" in this way, he means a transaction output, often a UTXO.


It's in the list of transactions, so it's included in the Merkle tree/root calculation.


It's a normal transaction, but it can only have one input, and that input is special. The scriptSig of that input is not processed in the normal way. The transaction is called a coinbase transaction, and the scriptSig is sometimes called the "coinbase". Originally, miners could put whatever they wanted in the coinbase scriptSig, maybe even nothing at all, but later on some softforks have made certain pieces of data required there, such as the block height. Bitcoin inputs don't explicitly say how much BTC they're inputting, and that applies also to the coinbase transaction -- you have to process the entire block to figure out what the input value is (the subsidy + all fees in the block).
The outputs are normal outputs, so they could pay to a regular address or a P2SH address or whatever, and there can be many outputs.


Blocks aren't allowed to be empty. They must have at least the coinbase transaction. And the header is always the same size regardless of how many transactions are in the block. The quote is just emphasizing that only the header is being considered, without the associated transactions.
The paper certainly is a fun and interesting document, though I wouldn't recommend it to beginners. It was targeted primarily at people who already had some exposure to complex crypto-based systems of this sort, so it was never good for beginners (I *did* have some experience with this sort of thing before Bitcoin, and it took me months to really understand the details of what the paper was talking about back when there was literally no other documentation). And although the paper *does* address most of the important aspects of even today's Bitcoin, it uses extremely dated terminology which confuses basically everyone who reads it, and it was written from a totally different perspective than today. So for beginners I'd recommend bitcoin.org and bitcoin.it first, and *then* you can check out the paper for an interesting historical perspective.

Without a doubt. The whitepaper was written some time before Bitcoin was finished, so although it's 99% accurate, it's rough in a lot of areas. Satoshi's understanding of Bitcoin started out very high, of course, but he still learned a lot over time, and he talked about a lot of different things. He has 575 forum posts and a handful of posts elsewhere, a lot of them about boring tech support things, but many with extremely interesting tidbits regarding the whys behind Bitcoin, overall design things, politics/society stuff, etc.
For someone looking to become a Bitcoin expert, I think that it's best to read and understand all of the *modern* documentation (eg. bitcoin.org dev docs, the wiki, etc.), and only *then* read all of Satoshi's stuff. Then you'll know most of what Satoshi's talking about before you actually read it, so you won't get tripped up too much by dated terminology and not-yet-perfected explanations. When you see discrepancies between what Satoshi talks about and the modern documentation, it'd be a useful exercise for you to figure out why these exist.

There are a few other ways, but they're more difficult or worse in various ways.
Another fairly easy way (but see *caveats*, below):
1. Shut down Bitcoin Core.
2. Make a backup of your wallet.dat. Keep this backup for a long time, even after this is apparently resolved, just in case.
3. Start Bitcoin Core with the command-line argument `-zapwallettxes=1`. Wait for it to fully start, which will take a long time. Only start Bitcoin Core with this command-line argument this one time: remove it later.
4. Being sure to manually specify a large transaction fee (expressed in BTC/kB, *not* a fixed value), send yourself (or another wallet of yours) a transaction which *totally empties* your Bitcoin Core wallet. Select the option to subtract the fee from the recipient.
5. In the transaction list, right click the transaction you just created and select "copy raw transaction". Paste to a text file. If the transaction doesn't go through promptly, you can try giving this to the various "pushtx" sites.
* Step 4 above is extremely bad for privacy, and could require an especially large fee. There's a way to avoid both of these issues (you have to spend UTXOs such that the new transaction is mutually exclusive with the old one), but it's much more complicated to explain to someone not already pretty familiar with low-level Bitcoin.
* The stuck transaction will *appear* to be gone after just step 3, but as I mentioned in my last comment, the transaction can go through at any time (even years later, potentially) even if the sending wallet forgets about the transaction. You need to do something to prevent this, which step 4 does.
* `zapwallettxes` will delete any 0-conf or conflicted transactions from your wallet.

jl2012 has proposed doing hardforks in a way similar to BIP 9 so that lightweight clients know that a hardfork is happening and can notify the user. Though you can't *require* that miners do this if they're going to start mining invalid blocks anyway.
Satoshi envisioned lightweight clients accepting fraud proofs broadcast through the TCP network in order to detect and reject invalid chains. For example, if a block allows the same coins to be spent twice on the same chain, the fraud proof would consist of the input transaction, the two spending transactions, and the Merkle branches linking all of these transactions to their blocks. Upon receiving and verifying the fraud proof, the lightweight node can immediately reject that block and all blocks after it as invalid. Actually setting up fraud proofs on the protocol is difficult because you often need a totally different proof for each consensus rule, and a few rules need softfork protocol changes in order to be reasonably provable.

Use `listtransactions`. If you don't want to look through all transactions, you can assign the address to an account with `setaccount` and then use `listtransactions INSERT_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE`. New transactions are always added to the end of the listtransactions list, so it's safe to poll it. If you don't need a lot of details about the transactions, you could instead use `getreceivedbyaddress ADDRESS 0`.
* 0-conf transactions are absolutely unreliable, and could be cancelled at any time. You shouldn't complete your end of any deal unless either the transaction has at least 1 confirmation or you will have some recourse in case of fraud.
* In rare cases, even a transaction with multiple confirmations can be invalidated. A complete Bitcoin payment processing system will need to handle this; often `walletnotify` is used.

Banks also "produce" nothing, but they provide a service. Bitcoin similarly provides a valuable service: permissionless transactions, a "digital gold" useful for storing value in some situations, smart contracts impossible without cryptocurrency, etc. These services *create* value in the economy -- they don't just shuffle it around. Speculators in all markets also provide a service of taking on price risk from those who don't want it; non-speculators don't like volatility, and the main effect of trading is to reduce volatility. Perhaps it is not *completely* "fair" for someone to make money by just buying and holding BTC (though nobody who knows anything would accuse me of *merely* holding BTC), but life's not fair, and it works well enough.

It's not actually a change to the consensus rules, but it's in the consensus part of Bitcoin Core's code.
For a few things, Bitcoin Core wants to know whether it's doing the initial block download (IBD), or just catching up with a few days/weeks' worth of recent blocks. Previously, Bitcoin Core would guess that it is in IBD by seeing if its block height is greater than or equal to the largest-height checkpoint. This was not very accurate because the concept of checkpoints is planned to be removed, and no new checkpoints have been added for a long time. Now, Bitcoin Core will come with the total work of the longest chain, and it will know that it is still in IBD when the total work for its longest chain is less than this number.
* *total work* = the average number of hashes required to completely regenerate every block in a block chain
* *checkpoint* = a block hash and associated height hard-coded into Bitcoin Core. A block at that height without the matching hash is marked as invalid regardless of anything else. This allows for certain important optimizations, but it is a slight form of centralization, so it's planned to be removed at some point.

If &gt;50% of miners support it, but less than 95%, then they can immediately activate it by just rejecting all non-SegWit blocks. The percentage immediately goes to 100%, and SegWit activates.
An infinite amount of total transaction capacity is possible with 1MB blocks via Lightning and sidechains. Lightning does not need any more softforks to function at high efficiency, though SegWit would increase efficiency even further. Decentralized sidechains require one or more softforks, however. Also see my two posts about quick-and-dirty scaling of Bitcoin as it exists today: [[1]]( [[2]](
Miners are employees of the Bitcoin ecosystem, so if they are consistently working against Bitcoin, then they should be fired by changing the PoW. Any softfork can be done as a hardfork without miner cooperation, but if a softfork ends up having to be done in this way due to miner non-cooperation, the PoW should probably be changed at the same time.

It's fairly common when a company does a chapter 11 bankruptcy for debtholders to get shares in the reoganized company (or some other security). I'd guess that BitFinex's situation would be the same, though they apparently did it in a non-standard way. I suspect that it would not be classified as theft, but more as if pre-default you owned x shares of some "IOU-BTC" security, which then defaulted and transformed into some BFX securities, resulting in an *unrealized* loss. But you should definitely consult an accountant.

No, it doesn't require a hardfork or even a softfork. It can be done with a change in the P2P protocol, like compact blocks or bloom filters.
Sipa has a design for this which reduces block sizes by 20-30%, and can be applied retroactively to past blocks. It's basically just a type of on-disk and over-the-wire compression, vaguely similar to how various other protocols (HTTP, TLS, etc.) have transparent compression.

It's ~impossible in a trustless, decentralized system for a cryptocurrency to know/regulate its own price, since price is a messy and subjective human thing. (Maybe it'd be possible if you could create a human-level AI...) Therefore, a cryptocurrency is almost always going to be either inflationary or deflationary at any given time. In order to guarantee that you very rarely have deflation, you'd have to make your cryptocurrency permanently very inflationary.
In response to the world's completely messed-up economy, which ended up that way in part due to economists who have as one of their core beliefs that deflation is the devil, Satoshi chose to make Bitcoin near-maximally deflationary, more so even than gold. If deflation actually is as bad as many economists say, then it's a wonder that everyone didn't drop dead in the thousands of years when gold was being used as money; but in that case, or if gold is reasonably OK but Bitcoin goes a bit too far, then I guess Bitcoin will fail and someone will have to create a cryptocurrency with a permanent 2% inflation or whatever. But if Bitcoin *does* end up being a stable money in the long-term despite being ultra-deflationary, this'll definitively disprove the Keynesian central-bank nonsense which rules the world currently.

No. With raw SegWit (which won't be common initially), anyone would very easily be able to spend the BTC. It's a little more difficult with the SegWit-in-P2SH format intended to be used initially, but it can be spent if anyone knows:
* That your output is a SegWit output. (They're normally indistinguishable from P2SH outputs until spent.)
* What the witness script is. This can be guessed if it's known who you're paying.
Also, even after it's activated I'd wait at least ~6 months before putting lots of value in SegWit outputs to ensure that a big chunk of the *economy* is verifying SegWit, not just miners.

Net neutrality is just a trick for governments to grab more power. The government should keep their hands off of the Internet. It's a *good idea* for ISPs to deprioritize most P2P traffic in preference to traffic where latency matters more, such as Web traffic. Requiring equal treatment raises prices, and could even worsen the situation (largely already caused by government) where most areas have only one or two broadband ISPs to choose from.
In the highly unlikely event that an ISP significantly blocks or throttles Bitcoin traffic on its own (ie. without government forcing it to), and the ISP has a monopoly preventing you from switching to a new ISP, you could use Bitcoin via Tor, which makes the traffic look like HTTPS traffic.

A bech32 address is composed of two parts: a human-readable part on the left, and the data on the right. The two components can be of varying length, and so are separated by a 1. 1 cannot appear in the data part. Bech32 SegWit address will use `bc` as the human-readable part, for "Bitcoin".

It is possible to increase the max block size to any level with a softfork. One way of doing it would be to create a sidechain with a higher max block size, and require that all full nodes enforce this sidechain's rules. This gives the sidechain Bitcoin-level security, and is a softfork. Old nodes would continue to publish old-style addresses. New nodes would need to publish both an old-style address and a new-style address, at least until essentially all of the economy had upgraded. New nodes could more-or-less transparently route transactions between the old and new chains as necessary for transactions, and old nodes would still be able to transact with everyone; end-users would not need to consciously be aware of the two different sidechains.

This is possible in Bitcoin today using [micropayment channels]( but nobody actually does it yet because there isn't a standard protocol for it, there's no good software for it, and it can be a bit cumbersome. How it'd work is that you'd tie up x BTC, and then slowly you could send money to the recipient 1 satoshi at a time up to the total you tied up. Setting up and shutting down a payment channel require on-chain transactions and the associated fees and delays, but the intervening micropayments are instant and free.
[Lightning]( will create a network of micropayment channels so that you can usually send micropayments instantly &amp; off-chain without having to set up a new channel (which would require an on-chain transaction). However, Lightning transactions will probably have a very small per-transaction fee, which *might* preclude truly tiny micropayments.

They don't have any reliable sources, so it's probably fake.
Stylometry is in fact a big issue with anonymity, though. It probably can't ever constitute proof on its own, but existing anonymity technologies like Tor mostly rely on blending into a crowd; if a fairly powerful attacker already strongly suspects you, then Tor and similar technologies will be completely useless. I've been thinking for several years that the best way to handle this might be to create a very rigid conlang, where the same ideas written by two different people will always be exactly the same, and where grammar/spelling can be checked by computer so that you don't introduce a pattern of identifying errors.
Note that Satoshi was probably actively trying to defeat stylometry, since he did weird things like using inconsistent American/English spellings throughout his writing.

I see two plausible scenarios where that could happen:
* A breach in the crypto, especially ECDSA.
* (Very long-term.) In the future, Bitcoin might evolve using sidechains. Devs would create essentially an entire new version of Bitcoin with many improvements, but would attach it to Bitcoin as a sidechain. That means that you'd be able to trade 1 BTC for 1 next-gen-BTC and vice-versa, guaranteed. After years of testing, everyone would just naturally move to the sidechain since it is superior, and this would become the new definition of Bitcoin. After many more years when almost the entire economy will have moved to the sidechain, the old Bitcoin might either utterly fail due to being unmaintained, or support for the old Bitcoin might intentionally be dropped for scalability/performance reasons, and so it'd be impossible at that point to trade old-BTC for next-gen-BTC.
Before 2014 or so experts sometimes seriously considered the idea that for scalability reasons the protocol could be changed so that coins that hadn't been moved for many years would be destroyed, but more recent research into UTXO-set scalability makes this solution seem redundant and very unlikely.
In case of a major break in the crypto, I think that it would be a good idea to say, "it's almost certain that many coins will be in the process of being actively stolen due to the broken crypto after SOME_DATE, so let's just destroy all coins that haven't been moved to secure addresses by SOME_DATE so that a huge chunk of BTC isn't stolen or 'un-lost' and given to immoral hackers." Some people freak out about this suggestion, but I think it'd be a lot less controversial if we were just months away from over a million BTC being un-lost.
However, it is **not** safe to rely on *transactions* long-term. You absolutely should not create a timelocked transaction or whatever and expect it to still be valid years from now. Softforks occur all the time which invalidate transactions which were previously valid. About a year is the longest you should timelock a transaction and expect it to still work.

His proposal there, which was also the general idea at the Hong Kong miner meeting which he and a couple of other devs attended, was to do SegWit first and then later to hardfork such that the base block size (aka MAX_BLOCK_SIZE) is set to 2 MB, but the SegWit discount is also changed from 75% to 50% simultaneously. This changes the effective max block size from:
* 1 MB - 1 MB without anything.
* ~1.7MB - 4 MB with just SegWit
* ~2.1MB - 3 MB with SegWit plus BlueMatt's hardfork
So it's actually kind of a narrowing/reduction in max block size, which is why he thought that it'd be especially likely to get consensus.
However, later research revealed that increasing the base max block size might be unexpectedly costly because the base max block size is currently the only limit on the rate at which new UTXOs can be added to the UTXO set. The size/performance of the UTXO database is one of the main performance bottlenecks. Therefore, it might be necessary to add either an additional arbitrary hard limit on the net number of UTXOs each block can create (I think this'd be fine, but several devs think that it's too kludgy) or solve the UTXO problem once and for all (solutions are known, but are very complex).

Some people have predicted that, and that'd be nice, but it's difficult to say. It may turn out that mining centralization won't be so easily gotten rid of.

When Satoshi was around, he was the one person with all the answers. Nobody came close to understanding Bitcoin as well as he did, and he had a good answer to anything you threw at him, since he had in fact thought about this stuff very deeply for several years. If you had a good question, you could often email Satoshi and receive a great answer. So Bitcoin's very first community was composed of perhaps a couple hundred people who got almost all of their Bitcoin knowledge from Satoshi, either through one-on-one communication or by reading his forum posts. This generated a lot of faith in Satoshi. For example, about a year after Satoshi's last forum post, I wrote in a set of [contingency plans]( that in case of emergency we should "Email Satoshi, even though he is believed to be gone. A serious issue may 'bring him out of retirement', which would be helpful."
Although nowadays only a few people are still around from the original group, the original community very strongly conveyed their faith in Satoshi to "later generations". If someone asked a question, often we would know the answer because we had learned it from Satoshi, and so we would answer like, "It's &lt;xyz&gt; because &lt;abc&gt;. Satoshi talked about this here: ...", or, if we were lazy (which was often...), "It's &lt;xyz&gt; because Satoshi said so here: ...".
There is still a lot of value in Satoshi's writings, and there probably always will be. Satoshi was very intelligent, wise, and forward-looking. But now, 7 years later, it is no longer rational to treat Satoshi as the single greatest font of Bitcoin knowledge which he certainly was for the first several years. Doing so is similar to how people in the middle ages found it difficult to diverge from Aristotle on anything, even though Aristotle lived over a thousand years earlier, since Aristotle had been *so* amazingly correct and wise about so many things. Reading Satoshi's stuff at some point is an excellent idea, but you really have to do so in the context of later events/research, and not as if you're reading the bible.

No, the max block size is a limit enforced by the full-node economy on miners.

A really difficult thing to deal with is characteristic grammar structures.

It's probably impossible to completely isolate a country like that. The miners within China would find a way to connect to the rest of the Internet via one or more satellite Internet links or whatever.
Furthermore, the Bitcoin P2P network is designed so that netsplits are very difficult to maintain. For example, if there were 5000 Bitcoin full nodes within China, and they could all communicate with each other fine, but only *one* of them figured out some way to connect to the outside Internet, then this would be enough to keep all 5000 Chinese Bitcoin nodes up-to-date. If miners within China took no further measures, this'd only cause higher latency.

*Guaranteeing* the price of a cryptocurrency in relation to fiat currency or real-world things can't be done in a decentralized way because the whole concept of price is messy and subjective. There isn't any algorithm that allows you to calculate the current price from obvious/non-centralized/not-manipulatable data. If you were willing to accept some centralization, I see two ways of getting price stability:
First, you could guarantee a price by having each coin backed by some other asset. Some centralized party would hold an asset (eg. gold or dollars), and would allow you to exchange each coin for a fixed amount of that asset whenever you want. Then the price per coin should be very close to the price of the appropriate amount of the underlying asset. If you want an extra high level of price stability, the underlying asset could even be a basket of several commodities or something. This sort of scheme is *very* centralized, though.
Second, you could have the equivalent of a central bank which would buy and sell bonds issued by the system itself. When the central bank buys existing bonds, it creates money out of thin air to do so; when it sells bonds, the proceeds from the sale are destroyed. (Although money tied up in bonds still technically exists, it's removed from the economy for a long time until the money plus interest is recreated from thin air again at maturity, at which point the central bank can just issue more bonds if necessary.) If the central bank thinks that prices are too low, it creates *x* bonds and sells them at auction. If the central bank thinks that prices are too high, it conducts a reverse auction in order to buy *y* previously-issued bonds. (Where *x* and *y* are guesses by the central bank.) If there are far too few bonds in existence, the central bank could instead do a positive-EV lottery or something. Probably the central bank can't maintain zero inflation/deflation long-term, but maybe they could keep annual inflation below 1% indefinitely, which is survivable.
(The above is more-or-less how central banks and fiat currencies actually work, BTW...)
The central bank thing would be interesting because the system could, if well-designed, remain *somewhat* decentralized by imposing hard limits on what the central bank can do, and by having the central bank make decisions based on multisig amongst 100 independent entities or something. I don't think that price stability is nearly important enough to warrant adding this trust/centralization, but perhaps something like this would satisfy the mainstream-economics-types who worry about Bitcoin's "deflationary spiral" and such. I'm surprised that an altcoin hasn't tried this yet. One "issue" is that it's less obvious how you would pump-and-dump it: you'd have to actively trade system-issued bonds to make money rather than just holding the coins, since the coins should stay at a somewhat stable value.
In Bitcoin, the goal is to minimize centralization, so nothing like the above is going to happen. More trade volume would reduce volatility, as would the introduction of high-quality derivative markets, but I wouldn't expect Bitcoin to have lower volatility than eg. gold for a very long time, if ever.

It's impossible to say; that'd have many huge, wide-reaching effects. One factor is that nuclear-weapons-caused EMPs could seriously damage the Internet and therefore Bitcoin, so maybe people would flee from cryptocurrencies into gold and other physical things if they thought that more widespread nuclear war was possible. I recommend owning some gold/silver in case something like that happens. (Not really for *investment*, but just so that you have some value in case *everything* collapses.)

Most pools use Bitcoin Core to manage the block creation process, and Bitcoin Core's default behavior is to (more-or-less) fill blocks with the highest-fee bytes it can.

Yes, it is absolutely insecure to rely on 0-conf transactions. They're a low-reliability IOU. Attacks such as you've described have been done in practice many times. (RBF is not required.) Note however that the existence of a double-spend transaction like that is nearly *mathematical proof* of fraud, and would presumably have legal consequences if they're able to track you down.
It's currently not practical to use Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies in untrusted point-of-sale situations like that, since waiting more than ~30 seconds is unreasonable, and it is not securely possible to have a block interval low enough to consistently be that fast. Technologies which result in instant confirmation such as Lightning or blinded bearer certificates are needed for point-of-sale.

@_date: 2016-12-10 04:42:38
It's been possible for decades to do a cryptographic transaction system. Alice signs a transaction saying "Send 10 coins to Bob", then Bob signs a transaction saying "Send 5 of those 10 coins that I got from Alice to Carol." Etc. You can verify that a received transaction is legitimate by following the chain of transactions from whatever authority initially created the coins through all of the signed transfers of ownership of those coins.
The one problem with this system is the following attack: Alice signs a transaction saying "Send 10 coins to Bob", but then she also signs a transaction saying "Send 10 coins to Dean", spending the exact same coins. Now both Bob and Dean can follow the transaction chain from the coin-creation authority up to Alice; the transaction looks valid to both Bob and Dean. Alice has just created 10 coins out of thin air. This is called the *double-spending problem*.
As far back as the 1980s, cryptocurrency systems were designed which resolved this by requiring the recipient of every transaction to register each transaction with a central server. Then the server knows which coins are spent, and can tell a recipient if he's receiving already-spent coins. It's even possible to use a cryptographic technique called blind signing to prevent the central server from knowing who owns which coins. However, there are inherent issues with centralization, even if the central authority has very little knowledge, so Satoshi set out to build a system that required no centralization.
Satoshi's solution to this problem, and his most important breakthrough, was to use a proof-of-work block chain to order transactions. If someone tries to double-spend, usually only one version will get into the block chain. Rarely, one version could get into one block and one version could get into a different block created at about the same time. But miners always build onto the longest valid chain, so the network will *eventually* converge onto a single ordering. So if you have a transaction that's buried under several blocks (called *confirmations* in Bitcoin), it's very unlikely that a double-spend will ever end up in the longest chain. And even in the rare event that someone is defrauded due to double-spending on confirmed transactions, the existence from each node's perspective of a single longest valid block chain prevents double-spenders from creating new coins out of thin air, protecting the system as a whole. (A lot more could be and has been written on this.)

I expect the stock market to drop right after the election no matter who wins, maybe more if Trump wins because investors expect Clinton to win. Furthermore, I expect the stock market to drop in December in anticipation of an interest rate increase, though I would not be totally surprised if the actual increase doesn't really happen. These drops might lead into a longer-term downward trend -- the stock market is currently in a huge bubble --, but they might not.
The Bitcoin price seems to be only very mildly connected to external events, though. Even if the stock market is dropping dramatically, the BTC price *could* also drop, or vice-versa. I think that increases/decreases in the BTC market price are usually driven by speculative/technical factors rather than fundamentals.

There's already terminology for this stuff:
* Full nodes independently verify the current state of the Bitcoin currency and will absolutely reject any invalid block. This requires downloading all historical blocks/transactions. It doesn't matter how full nodes actually get their data; theoretically, they don't even need to use the TCP Bitcoin network. It's the act of verification which makes a full node.
* A node which accepts incoming connections (typically on port 8333) is called a listening node.
* A node which stores all of the data necessary for a new node to become a full node is called an archival node. *Full* nodes that do not do this are called pruned nodes. (Lightweight nodes that don't store full blocks are neither archival nor pruned nodes.)
All combinations of these node types are more-or-less possible:
* 000 (non-full, non-listening, non-archival): This is a typical lightweight node. Note that some people call these types of nodes "SPV nodes", but SPV as envisioned by Satoshi included the concept of fraud proofs, which are not implemented yet, so modern non-full wallets are better called lightweight nodes rather than SPV nodes.
* 001: Non-standard. A node which makes only outgoing connections and downloads every block it sees without verifying any of them could perhaps be said to fall into this category.
* 010: Non-standard. A lightweight node that accepts incoming connections and maybe blindly relays blocks/transactions without verifying them.
* 011: Non-standard. Like 001, but also accepts incoming connections.
* 100: `-listen=0, -prune=N` in Bitcoin Core (or listen=1 without port forwarding). Note that this type of node *can* still upload blocks to peers, most commonly when a new block is relayed. I believe that Bitcoin Core non-listening pruned nodes can even upload somewhat historical blocks (but not *too* far back) when it tries to relay a block that the receiving node cannot link to the tip of their longest chain, which triggers the receiving node to request historical blocks.
* 101: `-listen=0` in Bitcoin Core (or listen=1 without port forwarding). As above, it can still upload blocks and service various other network requests if it happens to connect to nodes which make such requests.
* 110: `-prune=N` in Bitcoin Core. Same as 100 except that it accepts incoming connections. Bitcoin Core does not by default make connections to these nodes, but theoretically you could. In the future, these sorts of nodes might advertise that they're storing some *segment* of historical blocks, and then you could sync by connecting to several different such nodes.
* 111: Default settings of Bitcoin Core, with port forwarding. The most useful type of node. Lightweight nodes are especially reliant on data provided by these nodes; lightweight nodes won't ever connect to non-listening nodes (in contrast, a full node can sometimes receive useful data via an incoming connection), and pruned nodes can't service most of the requests that lightweight nodes need.

No, it's 2^80 operations to find *any* two colliding addresses. In other words, you almost always collide with an empty address that *you* generated in your attempt to find a collision. If you're trying to attack any *specific* addresses, then it's about 2^160 operations if the public key is unknown (ie. single-use addresses) or a little less than 2^128 operations if the public key is known. With quantum computers (which don't exist yet and may not exist for decades, at least in a dangerous form), it would be 2^80 *quantum operations* if the public key is unknown, and known public keys would be quickly broken.
The OP's image is a bit famous among Bitcoin experts for being hugely misleading in favor of Bitcoin's security, but you've gone too far in the other direction. If it cost 550 BTC to attack any address, then someone would've attacked one of the several addresses containing 100k+ BTC. Bitcoin's crypto is totally beyond the reach of any attacker using any known tech; a successful attack on Bitcoin's crypto would imply a major new discovery in computation or mathematics.

Seriously this time: I know that Luke put a lot of thought into this, and there are good reasons for these recommendations. With how things currently work, even 1MB blocks *do* cause several serious problems. But such a huge increase in fees would probably be pretty damaging, and I don't think that it's even close to necessary. There are many scaling enhancements that seem not too distant, like pruning + sharded block storage, temporary-lightweight-Core, compacted transactions, etc.
I do like the general idea of a conservative automatic adjustment of ~17.7% per year. I also like OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT a lot.
Not sure about expiring validation after 7 years -- that sounds like a lot of risk for not much potential reward. If we can wait 7 years for a softfork, then it can probably be done as a hardfork with a 7-year delay.

The network doesn't know about addresses at all. When you give a wallet an address, the wallet converts the address into an internal format which humans are never supposed to see. So you could design a wallet which accepts bech32 addresses now, or any other address format that you want.

Bitcoin Core can't actually send/receive SegWit transactions yet. Once SegWit activates, Bitcoin Core will add support for this. I imagine that the existing API calls will just start returning SegWit addresses, which are indistinguishable from other P2SH addresses (starting with 3). Most services won't need to do anything except upgrade.
AFAICT, you'd only need to make changes if:
* You're processing hex/binary transactions or blocks directly using `getblock`,etc.
* Something in your code doesn't like addresses starting with 3 instead of 1.
* You're giving addresses out, and you expect the person paying to be unable to pay to P2SH addresses, even though almost all wallets have supported P2SH addresses for years.

Right. If everyone uses Lightning for all transactions, and Lightning works as well as is hoped, then the max block size essentially becomes a limit on the number of Bitcoin *users* (who need to do open/close transactions) rather than a limit on transactions.

There's no need for any miner support if you're doing a long flag day. If 99% of the economy has upgraded, but some miners (even the majority) have not, then miners get forcibly removed from the network on the hardfork flag day, largely without consequences for non-miners.
I prefer not to use miner signalling, since the Bitcoin consensus rules should be decided by the full-node economy, and then miners should follow. If *miners* can in all cases veto consensus-rule changes (or worse, unilaterally change the consensus rules), then Bitcoin is insecure. Full-node-initiated hardforks are the only defense against certain types of miner abuse. Although perhaps it doesn't matter in this particular type of hardfork, I prefer not to set the precedent if it can be avoided.
The 2-year-delayed flag day is still my preferred method of doing hardforks. Luke and others have been working on "evil hardfork" (aka "soft hardfork") stuff which could potentially increase the safety of a shorter-delay hardfork, but I don't like evil hardforks because you have to be *absolutely sure* ahead of time that there's going to be no resistance to the hardfork, or else you end up having miners attacking some segment of the economy, which is unacceptable. Although both outcomes are very very bad, it's better to have Bitcoin split than to have some segment of the economy attacked/marginalized.
Also, nowadays I'm thinking that for any hardfork except perhaps for especially straightforward ones, it should be done first by creating a Bitcoin-security sidechain with the new hardfork rules (this is a softfork), slowly moving the economy to this sidechain over the course of years, and then maybe several years later you can schedule the removal of the old chain (in a way that doesn't destroy any coins still there) in order to clean things up and reduce full-node costs (this removal is a hardfork). Wallets can automatically route transactions between different chains as necessary. This is a much safer and cleaner way of doing hardforks than any other method. I think any hardfork can be straightforwardly made to work like this except for some hardforks having to do with the PoW or block header.

It's a multi-step process. I think you have to pass 2 (maybe 3, not sure) messages each way in order to set up a channel, 2 each way every time you want to use the channel to transact, and 1 each way to cooperatively close the channel. It's probably not something you're going to want to do via copy/paste; probably you'll want a direct IP connection.
It can't be done all at once because the security of the scheme requires that knowledge be withheld from your counterparty until after they provide a signed transaction.

The really irreversible ones like Perfect Money end up acting like mostly-separate currencies, since just like BTC, it is extremely risky to send someone an irreversible transaction in return for a reversible one.

To actually get *into* these services, you had to go through similar hoops as to get into BTC now -- wire transfers, high fees, long waits, etc.

Bitcoin doesn't operate in terms of *balances*. Although the idea of address balances *sometimes* makes some sense, if you think that addresses have balances, then you're going to keep getting confused by stuff like this.
In the past, address A received a ~1BTC coin, address B received a 1BTC coin, and address C received a ~0.02BTC coin. You asked Bitcoin Core to send 2 BTC to address A (with the receiver-pays-fee option). Out of all of the coins in your wallet, it semi-randomly chose these three coins in order to fill this order. (Note that when I say "coin" here, I mean "unspent transaction output", not the BTC unit of account.) These three coins were melted down and re-minted into one ~2BTC coin and one ~0.1BTC coin. The smaller one was change sent to a new address, since you can't use a coin without melting it down and re-minint new ones, ie. you can't use only part of a distinct coin / unspent transaction output. This is how you must think of Bitcoin transactions: like physical coins getting melted down and re-minted, with addresses being like vaults *holding* one or more coins. You must not think of it as address balances being adjusted, or you will end up having various subtle misunderstandings.

There's a lot of overlap between people who:
* Believe that all of the world's transactions should be on a single block chain.
* Believe that miners control Bitcoin absolutely, like some sort of legislative body.
XT/Classic/Unlimited believed in both, so they did a ridiculous miner trigger thing where nothing would happen if the majority of miners didn't support them. (And if the majority of miners *had* supported them, then they'd have just ended up as an altcoin like Bcash, absent majority economic support.) Bcash has the slightly more sensible position of adopting only the former view, and so they did the fork [like Satoshi said]( using a time trigger that activates regardless of miner support. Additionally, an important part of Bcash was a time-based, Satoshi-style softfork which *absolutely rejected even the longest PoW chain* if it didn't fork properly; this is something that most BUers wouldn't like.

Several wallets nowadays use this scheme: You can access your BTC if either of the following is true:
* You have a shorter, memorizable passphrase AND either a wallet file or a specific hardware wallet device like the Ledger S or Trezor. There's enough randomness in the wallet file that it can't realistically be attacked.
* You have a several-word seed which is created when you first create your wallet. You're supposed to write this down and put it in a safe deposit box or something. These seeds are long and random enough that they can't realistically be attacked.
Then if you forget your passphrase or lose your wallet file / device, you have a secure backup. Although imperfect in a few ways, this is probably the best way of storing BTC for most people today.
All current hardware wallets work like this, as do Electrum, MultiBit, and several other software wallets.
Some people advocate writing an actual private key onto paper, but this should not be done. You should never be working directly with keys, as doing so tends to be very error-prone and frequently leads to losses. What you should be writing on paper is a several-word seed mnemonic representing many keys.

LN (and non-LN Bitcoin transactions) can be used at any distance, but the effects of latency are magnified by the way the block chain works. If you're on Mars and you want to send a transaction to someone standing right next to you using Bitcoin, then they'd have to wait the normal amount of time *plus* twice the communication delay between Earth and Mars for a confirmation, since mining will be centralized to the region of Earth. Opening a new LN channel would have a similar delay. Once a channel is open, there would be no additional delay to send/receive transactions using that channel, since these transactions usually don't touch the block chain.
In practice, I expect each highly-populated planet to have its own block chain, either as a totally separate cryptocurrency or as a Bitcoin sidechain. For lightly-populated planets, LN might be sufficient.

One danger of time travel to keep in mind is that since the supply of BTC is very limited, if you acquired BTC in 2009-2011, you might deprive someone notable of BTC, which could perhaps influence their actions in a way which negatively impacts Bitcoin's growth. For example, ArtForz, one of the biggest early miners, reported to Satoshi several absolutely critical bugs which could've utterly destroyed Bitcoin if not handled very early on. If someone had tempted him with the offer of buying all of his BTC at the amazingly-high price of $20/BTC or whatever, maybe he would've left the Bitcoin community earlier than he did in reality, before he would've found these bugs.
Use time travel responsibly!

It's better to buy BTC with the mindset that someday you'll actually *use* your BTC for real transactions because it's better than your native fiat currency. If you're planning on "cashing out", then you're speculating, which most people suck at.
I suspect that the price will not go below $500 in the near future, and for as long as Bitcoin survives (hopefully many decades), I expect a slow upward trend. Then again, I wouldn't be *all* that surprised if the price drops to $400 tomorrow. Bitcoin is volatile and risky.

Yes. The idea of blinded bearer certificates was invented by David Chaum in 1983, and he called it ecash. (Obviously he didn't use BTC as the underlying asset...)


Yes. I think the best way to do it would be to periodically create a Bitcoin-security sidechain, but have a set date at which it loses its Bitcoin-security (ie. not all full nodes need to monitor that sidechain after that date) and it becomes SPV-security. Then people can probably still withdraw from the sidechain for at least a while after the expiration, though they lose some security.
Transferring balances from an old expiring sidechain seems messy. Maybe it can be done, but I'm not sure.

Off-chain solutions like Lightning or sidechains are necessary. Higher fees, contention for cheap block space, and confirmation delays are all very bad for the overall user experience, and off-chain transactions are the best way to solve all of these problems.
Further (on-chain) max block size increases are for many reasons desirable, but beyond SegWit we probably need at least these technical advancements before it will be safely possible:
* TXO commitments
* Sharded storage of old block data
* Decentralized rescan
* Syncing backward

You can find the details of blind signing in [this paper from 1996]( (which is also an interesting read because it shows just how far back many cryptocurrency concepts go).
In more detail, I think how you'd do it is:
* Gather N trustworthy people. Have these people each publish a Bitcoin public key, a master RSA public key, and one RSA public key per certificate denomination. Each person needs to run a signing server.
* When someone wants to enter the system:
    * The depositor creates a temporary deposit account with the bank, giving all bank members a public key which will be used to authenticate this temporary account.
    * The members of the bank cooperate to create an M-of-N P2SH multisig address with an additional unique no-op push in the P2SH script in order to generate a distinct address for the temporary deposit account, for bookkeeping.
    * The depositor sends the BTC to this address. Once well-confirmed, the bank signals that it is ready to issue certificates.
    *  The depositor generates random certificates, and then for each bank member the depositor blinds the certificate and sends it to the bank member to sign, authenticating this request with a signature using the previously-set-up public key associated with the temporary deposit account. Each denomination must be signed with the dedicated keypair for that denomination. Once the certificates are issued, the temporary deposit account is empty and can be forgotten. The depositor ends up with a number of certificates, each with N associated signatures.
* To transfer or withdraw:
    * The sender gives the signed certificates he created to the recipient.
    * The recipient creates a temporary deposit account with the bank, giving all bank members a public key which will be used to authenticate this temporary account.
    * Over a secure channel, the recipient transmits the certificates given to him by the sender to each bank member, associating them with the public key of his temporary deposit account.
    * Each bank member knows that the certificate is valid because each signature will be signed by the required number of bank members, and because the certificate contents does not exist in its database of spent certificates.
    * Each bank member adds each certificate to its database of spent certificates, and then credits the value of the certificate to the temporary deposit account.
    * To complete a transfer, the recipient generates new certificates in the same way as the deposit steps. To withdraw, a withdrawal is requested on the temporary deposit account, and the bank members work together to send some of the BTC secured by one or more of their deposit addresses. In either case, the deposit account is emptied and can be forgotten.
* Normally, certificates consist of random data. Contracts can be done by including with the random data a contract script. The bank sees the full certificate data when receiving it for reissue or withdrawal, and can verify an included contract at that time. (Probably the certificate will actually be the root of a hash tree, one leaf of which will the contract, provided separately from the certificate itself.) If the contract fails, the bank should refuse to credit the certificate -- someone else can try again later if they also have the certificate. Any inputs to the contract would be provided separately from the certificates, but over the same secure and two-way-authenticated channel.
Instead of having N different servers and RSA keys, you can have a smaller number of payment processing servers. These servers would save all transaction info and give it to the bank members to independently verify later. This increases efficiency. If the required threshold of payment processing servers are compromised, then they can issue unlimited certificates, which can probably be used to cause significant damage, but the separate bank members would be able to protect the underlying BTC and roll back to a consistent state -- the window in which illegitimate but valid-looking certificates could be produced would likely be short.
The bank can prove full reserve by publishing all of the transaction data that it receives (deposit, withdrawal, and reissue sessions), which third-parties can then replay to verify that the bank has been acting like it's supposed to. This means that the general public can try to attack anonymity, though this should be pretty difficult. The data would be like, "at xyz time, v BTC was moved from &lt;unknown&gt; to &lt;unknown&gt;" (with one of the &lt;unknown&gt;s being replaced by a Bitcoin address in deposits/withdrawals). That's not much to go on, though maybe it would be harmful in some cases.
I'm not an expert in this, so quite possibly I've made some mistakes or someone who has thought about this more than I have has developed improved procedures.

Both of them have to do with adding time-based constraints. Sequence is relative (eg. "x blocks in the future"), while lockTime is absolute (eg. "at block number y"). "Sequence" is also called *relative lockTime* in this context, since the sequence field was originally intended for something else but then mostly repurposed, so the name "sequence" could be confusing in this context.
You can use relative or absolute lockTime by themselves when you want to create a transaction that starts out invalid, but becomes valid at a later point in time. For example, you could create and sign a transaction that sends all of your BTC to your heirs but only becomes valid in 5 years, as a sort of will. (You could cancel it at any time by spending any of its inputs, making the time-locked transaction permanently invalid.) But in reality this is not so useful, so almost always, relative locktime is paired with CSV and absolute locktime is paired with CLTV.
When paired with CSV/CLTV, relative and absolute locktime constrain some *bitcoins themselves* rather than just transactions. For example, with absolute locktime + CLTV you could create an address such that any BTC sent there can only be spent after 2018. With relative locktime + CSV you could create an address such that any BTC sent there can only be spent after sitting unspent for 6 months. More usefully, these constraints can be combined with other smart contracts; for example, you could create an address such that BTC sent there can be spent if [(both you and your counterparty agree) OR (6 months have passed since the BTC was sent AND one of you and a counterparty agrees AND a third-party escrow signs off on it)]. Payment channel contracts such as the ones used in Lightning are vaguely similar to the previous example, though there's some crypto stuff instead of a third-party.
More specifically, in smart contracts like the example in []s above, CSV is used to add the constraint "x hours have passed since the BTC was constrained" or "y blocks have passed since the BTC was constrained". CLTV is used to add the constraint "the current time is after unix time t" or "the current block height is greater than b". The transaction creating the constraint by using CSV or CLTV in the output (possibly via P2SH and/or SegWit) does not necessarily need to have relative or absolute lockTime itself. CSV/CLTV requires that the transaction *spending* the CSV/CLTV output have an appropriate relative or absolute lockTime. You can use CSV or CLTV multiple times, like [(you agree) OR (3 months have passed AND Alice agrees) OR (6 months have passed AND Bob agrees)]. But you can't *invalidate* certain conditions like this impossible example: [(you agree) OR (3 months but no more than 6 months have passed AND Alice agrees)].
Summary of important points:
* nSequence and nLockTime do basically the same thing, but one is relative and one is absolute. Think of them as relative and absolute locktimes, not really two completely separate things. (Though for historical reasons they are somewhat different at a low level.)
* You can use absolute or relative locktimes by themselves, but usually they are paired with CLTV or CSV, respectively. CLTV/CSV are not *different* ways of time-locking transactions; they are complements to absolute/relative locktimes.
* You *could* use relative + absolute locktimes and CSV + CLTV all in one transaction, and there are imaginable cases where this would be useful, but more commonly *either* relative or absolute locktime is used.

I'm glad you're making a changetip replacement, and you ask a very good question!
It's not fair to charge the fee that Bitcoin Core charges to the person withdrawing, because the transaction size and therefore its fee depends on the characteristics of previous *deposits*, which may be entirely unrelated to the person withdrawing. Instead, I think that it would be most fair to handle fees in this way:
* For every on-chain *deposit*, charge a deposit fee of current_fee_rate \* 148 bytes \* *A*, where current_fee_rate is the output of the same `estimatefee` call that you will do when actually sending an on-chain transaction, 148 bytes is the approximate size of a TxIn spending BTC secured by a version-0 Bitcoin address, and *A* is an adjustment factor of around 1.0, explained more later. If the deposit fee makes the deposit negative, just treat it as no deposit -- don't try to subtract from the depositor's account. The idea here is that the depositor is paying for the future cost of spending his deposited BTC.
* For every on-chain withdrawal, charge current_fee_rate \* 78 bytes, where 78 bytes is the approximate size of a transaction with two outputs minus the already-paid-for inputs.
The service takes some risk because when calculating the deposit fee you're actually guessing at the fee that will apply when that deposit is later spent. To account for this, slowly increase the adjustment factor *A* from 1.0 until the service does not suffer any transaction-fee-related losses. (This is the most reasonable place to apply such an adjustment IMO.)

It's possible that due to a failure of the crypto or *maybe* due to a change in the protocol (unlikely), you might have to send all of your BTC to brand new addresses or else you'll lose the BTC, possibly within a fairly limited timeframe. Therefore, you should never cause BTC to get locked away for more than a year or so. The new addresses might or might not be tied to your 12 word seed; it's possible that you'll need to generate a new seed.
Nothing like this is *planned*, but it is possible. (If it happens, you'll hear about it if you follow Bitcoin even slightly, as it would be massive news.) It's also possible that your 12 word seed will be usable for 100 years or more.

It's in the scriptSig (aka "input script") for the input spending BTC sent to the address. If the address starts with 1, then the signature will be the first constant in the scriptSig and the public key will be the second. If the address starts with 3, then you'll need to actually read and understand the scriptSig to figure out where the public key(s) are. As a rough hint, usable Bitcoin public keys always start with the (hex) bytes 02, 03, or 04.
For example, [this transaction]( reveals that the public key of 13rRru... is 021a0662ca70... (You have to enable advanced mode in the footer to see the scripts.)
However, don't be *too* paranoid about revealing your public keys. The cryptographic security issues are at this point very theoretical -- nobody's *actually* going to try attacking your keys until probably years or even decades into the future. Address reuse is more of a concern for privacy and because incorrectly *assuming* that an address can be reused can cause mispayments.

Currently that is more-or-less true, though it's not a requirement of the Bitcoin network or anything. Bitcoin already exists on *two* networks: the Internet and Tor hidden services. Tor is centralized and based on the Internet, but if someone were to create an Internet-independent decentralized mesh network or something, Bitcoin could run on it just fine. The P2P network layer of Bitcoin is actually very simple -- far simpler than Freenet or even Tor --, and it can be straightforwardly adapted to work on any point-to-point underlying network. With some reasonably straightforward modifications, it could also work over weird (ie. not point-to-point) networks such as Freenet.

Not sure what the purpose of the Bitcoin ATM is in your scenario.
One fairly easy way of setting it up would be for the communication to occur over Tor hidden services. Several apps (including Bitcoin Core) use Tor's control-port API in order to automatically create hidden services, which are then used almost like IP addresses. With this, you don't need to worry about DNS / dynamic IPs or port forwarding, and privacy is improved, though the two parties would still have to be online at the same time in order to setup the channel or do a transaction. You could have a "payment channel address" which consists of a Tor hidden service address (abcdef.onion) plus a Bitcoin address to be used for authentication. (The channel itself should use brand new addresses, not this address.) Then the two parties just need to exchange each other's payment channel address, and presumably the wallet could keep trying to connect until you're both online at the same time and the channel can be established.
You could even do it via email. The parties would give each other their email address plus a Bitcoin address for authentication, and then the Bitcoin client would send the necessary messages in specially-formatted emails, to be picked up whenever the recipient comes online. Then both parties don't need to be online at the exact same time, though obviously it might take some times for operations to fully complete.

Decentralized 2-way peg requires a softfork, but this softfork would be completely different/independent from the SegWit softfork. Federated (ie. semi-centralized) 2-way peg is possible now.
SegWit is relevant to Lightning because it allows for the more efficient bidirectional payment channel scheme. Without SegWit, Lightning uses about twice as much on-chain data. But this wouldn't be the end of the world. The *really* desirable thing for Lightning was CSV, and that's already done.
Sidechains are very useful, but it's not a silver bullet. A sidechain can only have two of the following properties:
* The sidechain does not need a new, unique Bitcoin softfork, and Bitcoin full nodes don't need to know anything about the sidechain.
* The sidechain does not rely on a centralized functionary (or semi-centralized fixed group of functionaries).
* A majority of miners can't steal all BTC tied up in the sidechain.

You're probably too paranoid about revealing your public key. It's not a real threat right now.
If you really want to minimize public key exposure, then probably the best way to do it in practice would be:
* Enable coin control and then in the coin control window, enable tree mode instead of list mode.
* Whenever you send BTC, select an entire address in coin control. That'll empty the address, with any extra being sent to a new change address by default.
* After you've already emptied an address, you should send-to-self any further BTC you receive at that address, since that address's public key is now known. (As usual, you should not reuse addresses.)
* Be aware that when you select two or more different addresses in coin control, this will be strong evidence that both addresses are owned by the same person.
* Note that coin control's "received with address" is the first *non-change* address that you received the coins with. This is helpful for people who are trying to maintain privacy in recognition of the above point, since change outputs are often pretty easy to identify. However, the coins might not actually be secured by that address, but rather by a separate change address.
Again, I don't really recommend doing this because you'll end up paying higher total transaction fees for essentially no security benefit, though I don't think that there's any actual harm if you do it as I described.

In the future it will probably be possible for anyone to immediately (without the involvement of miners or nodes) create an SPV-level-security sidechain. Due to the substantially reduced security of such sidechains, I am not so convinced that they will be useful beyond certain low-value things such as experimentation and microtransactions. (There are also federated-security sidechains, which have a different sort of security model.) However, it is also possible to create a sidechain with the same security as Bitcoin, or to upgrade an existing SPV-level-security or federated-security sidechain to Bitcoin-level security, though a Bitcoin softfork is required for each such sidechain. These sidechains aren't vulnerable to miners any more than Bitcoin itself is. And they also retain most isolation properties -- if the sidechain somehow totally collapses, the original Bitcoin chain isn't affected.
Increasing the max block size in this way would *still* be an increase of the max block size, with all associated costs and benefits. Bitcoin full nodes must be full nodes on the main Bitcoin chain and all Bitcoin-level-security sidechains. A huge increase in the max block size via this method would probably lead to centralization and insecurity, etc.
And while I do not believe that the complexity would be a *major* barrier, it does increase complexity. Compared to this sidechain method, a hardfork max-block-size increase would be far more simple from a software engineering point of view, but depending on the circumstances it might be far more high-risk.
@_date: 2016-12-09 08:02:21
Previously, it was really cumbersome because you had to say "this channel must close before END_DATE, and could potentially be uncloseable until END_DATE". So you had to either risk having funds tied up for a long time by setting END_DATE far in the future or you had to keep recreating channels frequently. But due to the recent CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) softfork, this situation is massively improved. Now you don't need a specific end date: channels usually end only when the parties both agree, or in case of an uncooperative party it ends some time (a few days, probably) after the close is triggered.
I do think that it'd be useful for wallets to work on this. Though AFAIK, there's currently no standard protocol for setting up a payment channel. In order to open a channel, the sender and recipient need to directly communicate for a while; it's not as simple as giving someone a Bitcoin address.
One problem with raw payment channels is that you need to tie up BTC in order to use them. If you set up a payment channel with a bar for 0.5 BTC, then you won't be able to use that 0.5 BTC for anything else until you close the channel, and once you've paid the bar a total of 0.5 BTC, you'll have to create a new channel. Lightning aims to improve this by making it so that if you have a couple of channels, then you'll be able to reach any Lightning user without opening any more. Then you won't need to open/close channels as much, and it won't usually feel like your BTC is tied up at all.

I've talked about it a few times, but not in all that much detail. I don't know if there's a detailed proposal anywhere.
One way of doing it is like this:
* To deposit, on the main chain you send BTC to a special anyone-can-spend output like `0x00000001 &lt;script hash&gt;`, where the first constant identifies the sidechain and &lt;script hash&gt; is a hash of the sidechain's constraint script.
* Only after the above transaction has 100 confirmations (to protect against main-chain reorgs), on the sidechain you can create a transaction with an input which spends the above main-chain output. (You'd need a bit which indicates whether an input is on the sidechain or main chain.) The witness would be like a P2SH scriptSig, `&lt;serialized script matching above script hash&gt; scriptArg1 scriptArg2...`.
* To withdraw, on the sidechain you send BTC to a special unspendable output like `0x11111111  &lt;script hash&gt; OP_RETURN`. 
* Only after the above transaction has 100 confirmations, on the mainchain you can create a transaction with an input which spends from the special mainchain sidechain-deposit output. The witness should be *&lt;txID of sidechain withdrawal&gt; &lt;output index of sidechain withdrawal&gt; &lt;serialized script matching the above script hash&gt; scriptArg1 scriptArg2...*. You're only allowed to withdraw exactly as much as you withdrew according to the sidechain transaction (you might have to give some change back to the special address)
It's a bit messy (though AFAICT workable) to deal with output balances as in the last point above. Maybe there's a cleaner way.
The restrictions like "you're only allowed to withdraw exactly as much as you withdrew" are enforced by ~all Bitcoin miners and full nodes, who must also be full nodes on the sidechain (or else they can't verify withdrawal transactions fully). The blocks on the sidechain can be merge-mined. They could also use a separate PoW, but that might reduce the sidechain's security.
If someone is in a hurry and doesn't want to wait 100 blocks, you can do a trustless atomic cross-chain trade between the main chain and sidechain. Probably the counterparty will want a small fee for this.


It's no different. All full nodes eventually need to upgrade to enforce SegWit. This is basically already done for P2SH.
People aren't supposed to actually use softfork features until it seems that the vast majority of the full-node economy is enforcing it. Using it before then is basically trusting miners.


If we perpetually end up in a state where a lot of the economy verifies something and a lot of the economy doesn't, then there's a constant risk of the majority of miners maliciously or stupidly failing to validate, and then you get a split currency. If this situation lasted for a long time, it'd probably be safest to roll back the softfork so that this risk doesn't exist.

Bitcoin Core will actually prevent you from broadcasting a transaction with a *gigantic* fee. Though the instructions also have people double-check this like three times.
@_date: 2017-01-27 22:15:33


Mainly I'm thinking about the costs to full nodes:
* Storage of the block chain. Pruning helps this, but you need to download the block chain from somewhere, and the full block chain is also necessary for rescans.
* Initial block download *time*.
* Size of the UTXO set, which even pruned nodes have to store.
* Network usage. (This has recently improved somewhat due to compact blocks.)
Due to these costs, very few new people are running full nodes. The full block chain size is about 110 GB right now, for example, which is extremely inconvenient and one of the major factors turning people away from running a full node, even if it's not *expensive* to deal with if you really want to.
There are also issues with mining centralization/validation, but personally I tend to think of validation/security at the mining level to be a lost cause... (Which makes it even more important for full nodes to be widespread.)
If the above problems were going to be with us forever, maybe I'd be more sympathetic to Luke's proposal. But there are technologies to address these problems in the works right now:
* Storage: Storage can be sharded across many nodes, so that each node only stores like 1% of historical blocks overall, and you download the block chain sort of like how BitTorrent works. Rescans can maybe be done in a private way using [Private Information Retrieval algorithms](
* IBD time: Nodes can start out as lightweight nodes (planned for Bitcoin Core 0.15) and gradually become full nodes over time, reducing the pain of running a full node. Even better, with a softfork, nodes could sync backward so that after a fairly short period of time they'll be "mostly-full" nodes. There are also many smaller IBD-speed improvements in most Core releases.
* UTXO set size: There are proposals for permanently bounding the size of the UTXO set without imposing significant downsides on anyone, but this is further-out.
* Network usage: This can be somewhat improved using [compacted transactions]( though I expect network speed to be the long-term bottleneck.
Due to all of this, I think that 1MB is fine. SegWit's ~2 MB might be a bit uncomfortable for a while, but I think we're not far away from some of the improvements listed above making it fine again.


It's obvious to everyone who knows anything that infinitely doubling transaction fees each year is a totally serious proposal, and really the only way to survive moving forward.

I'm also aiming to express that you don't need to be a master cryptographer in order to understand these basic schemes, partly in the hope that somebody goes out and creates it -- I'd prefer that something possibly-sub-optimal like this gets created sooner rather than waiting for perfection.
TumbleBit seems to have the advantage that the tumbler can't at any point steal BTC, though I think that it'd require a lot more on-chain transactions. With certificates, transactions can remain off-chain for longer, and some people could transact using certificates without ever making an on-chain transaction.

Stealth addresses were originally invented/discussed in terms of Bitcoin before they were used in Bytecoin and then Monero. But while it's possible to do in Bitcoin without any softforks/hardforks, and some wallets have done so, the idea became very unpopular because it is extremely un-scalable. Bitcoin's primary goal is to be decentralized, which requires excellent scalability, so it's no good to sacrifice scalability for anonymity in Bitcoin. It makes much more sense in coins like Monero where the primary goal is anonymity and things like decentralization and low fees are secondary.
There are ways to improve anonymity in Bitcoin without breaking scalability, such as onion-routed Lightning payments or automatic CoinJoin-type stuff. Mimblewimble is also a very promising approach to combining scalability and anonymity, though Bitcoin probably cannot adopt Mimblewimble tech (except perhaps as a sidechain).

"Small blocker" is a misnomer. ~All so-called small-blockers support SegWit, which is a max block size increase. Many also support an eventual hardfork max block size increase. The better term is "decentralist".
A larger max block size would have many advantages:
* It'd be much more expensive to disrupt the network by spamming transactions, and the continuum of fees would become more smooth. This'd *reduce* (but not eliminate) the instances of stuck transactions. Though the *real* solution to stuck transactions is fee bumping by wallets.
* Transaction fees would go down, which would make Bitcoin more useful/attractive. I personally am not worried about how this would impact total mining rewards, since the subsidy is very high, it will remain high for at least 4-8 years, and I suspect that in the far future miners can be funded by assurance contracts and/or other alternatives.
* The max block size is a form of (de)central economic planning, which is distasteful for many reasons. Though I believe that for Bitcoin to have any security at all, some full-node-enforced limit (maybe not a single global limit) is just as necessary as the 21 million BTC cap (which is equally a form of economic planning).
* In the first few years of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin was extremely convenient. You could take anyone's address and send them nearly any amount of BTC immediately, usually with zero fee, and your transaction would almost always get confirmed in the next block. It felt like the Bitcoin block chain was a limitless ocean of capacity. This was really nice. Unfortunately, this was only possible because Bitcoin was absolutely tiny then, and it will never happen again on-chain, even if blocks became unlimited. A very similar feeling might eventually be possible with Lightning and well-designed Lightning-supporting wallets.
* It is a reasonable thought to argue that it'd be good for Bitcoin to grow very quickly so that it becomes so entrenched in society that fighting it becomes difficult. But anything that causes such super-fast growth would probably weaken Bitcoin's security so much that governments could easily co-opt it. Even today, the Chinese government could (via miners) totally shut down Bitcoin overnight; the *only* defense against this is a strong full-node economy credibly able to threaten a PoW change. Satoshi thought that each governments' desire to control the world's currency might eventually lead to a stalemate/compromise in which they'd agree to leave it decentralized, but IMO it's more likely their compromise would be to create some abomination. It's better to take as much time as is needed to make Bitcoin so secure and decentralized on a technical level (maybe even more than Satoshi thought possible) that it is beyond attack from any adversary.

Probably miners wouldn't usually even bother creating a block if there was no subsidy and no fees for them to collect. If they did, it's legal in Bitcoin for outputs to have 0 value. So the coinbase transaction could have 0 input value and 0 output value. (In fact, it could have *many* zero-value outputs, and all of these could legally be "spent" in other transactions.)

Note that running with pruning enabled doesn't reduce your security at all, and doesn't make you less of a full node. The main drawback is that you can't rescan your wallet anymore. Theoretically, you could have a pruning mode where the data necessary for rescanning is kept, but the witness data (not necessary for rescanning) is discarded. But this isn't implemented yet.
Many things could be improved about pruning mode as it exists now, but in the long run I think that everyone will be able to run in pruning mode without any drawbacks.

Bitcoin doesn't work with address balances. Any scheme that relies on address balances will not work. Bitcoin deals in unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).
Something like that has been more-or-less planned for years. It has several names: UTXO commitments, "flipping the chain", UTXO trees, etc. See for example [this post]( about it from 2012 (improvements to the idea have been made since then).
Note that if you don't process all transactions, then you're trusting miners. It's *not* as secure as today. I see two reasonable ways of using it:
* Use a UTXO commitment from a year or two ago, then sync forward. It's very unlikely that a miner attack has reached so far back without you hearing about it.
* Use a UTXO commitment from recently, then sync backward all the way to the genesis block. Then you start out as something like a SPV node, but you become progressively more and more of a full node.

For a given transaction, BDD = sum_over_inputs(BTC_spent * days_BTC_sat_unspent).
The main reason that the metric was created was that Bitcoin transactions used to be mostly free, and whether or not your transaction got into a block would at that time be largely dependent on a number called *priority*, where priority is more-or-less BDD/transaction_bytes for any given transaction. The network-wide bitcoin days destroyed was then sort of what "fees per block" would be today.
Nowadays few or no miners actually use priority at all, though, and Bitcoin Core no longer even supports it. But BDD can still be a somewhat-interesting stat for determining "real" transaction volume.

Among traditional investments, even aggressive ones, reducing risk is a very large factor, which limits returns. To some degree the law requires or strongly encourages this for many traditional investments (to the entire economy's detriment). Bitcoin on the other hand has had and continues to have high risk, which allows for substantial returns, but also requires much more care. For example, while I would not be particularly surprised if the BTC price exceeds $1000 in 6 months, I would also not be completely shocked if it sinks lower than $400. Also, although I consider it unlikely, I can *imagine* scenarios in which Bitcoin fails overall. So I would not for example recommend that someone put all of their savings into BTC, and for the majority of people (who are quite risk-averse investment-wise), I would not recommend buying more than a small amount of BTC.

This softfork is set up to require miners to signal readiness for SegWit before it is activated, but it's important to realize that all changes to the Bitcoin consensus rules are done by the Bitcoin economy/community, not really by miners.

The Chinese government can just seize the mining hardware located in China, which is often located in large, centralized facilities. Then they can start mining empty blocks, for example. Or worse, they could *slowly* try to subvert Bitcoin by adding additional restrictions. They could require that everyone register with them in order to transact, for example. The latter could also be done through laws rather than by directly seizing hardware.
Mining could move elsewhere, but that's a very slow process. There isn't enough hardware in existence to do it. Meanwhile, a miner with more than 50% of the mining power can do various evil things such as *undoing* old blocks (which can over time cause people to lose BTC because all BTC comes from block subsidies at some point) or mining invalid blocks which some lightweight clients will see as valid.
And if we're put on an even playing field with China, we're going to lose. In order to be able to win against powerful mining attackers, we have to be able to "cheat" by changing the PoW.

It can't be predicted directly from the address. But if, for example, you're doing a transaction to a single normal address via SegWit, and the destination address has already been used, then someone could theoretically try every address that's ever been used in order to find the correct witnessScript. Probably nobody *will* do this, but it isn't a *hugely* expensive attack to try.
If you send BTC to a brand new address, and you don't tell anyone the address, and you don't spend it until SegWit actually activates, then I don't see how anyone could steal it. (Though I still don't really recommend it.)

They often repeat the lie that comments are somehow manipulated, edited, or deleted using CSS. This isn't true. No editing takes place (and probably isn't possible), and if we wanted to delete a comment, we'd just delete it. Our CSS does something very simple: when you load a full comment page, the CSS just expands all comments that were collapsed due to being below-threshold. (You can tell which comments have been uncollapsed due to the CSS because they'll have a [+] next to them instead of a [-].) This prevents a small number of users (or sockpuppets) from being able to significantly reduce a user's ability to participate in discussions. Spinning this as censorship requires impressive doublethink; I have seen *many* big-blocker posts unhidden due to this CSS.
The other stuff in that medium post is either well-known policy or lies. For example, even though they've been persistently trying to find a (nonexistent) link between me and Blockstream, the best they've come up with is that I am somehow owned by Blockstream because I once *paid* someone who would in the future end up being employed by Blockstream.
As for policy, I've been very clear about it: If you don't like the policies, then you can leave. Subreddits are not democracies. We *could* just willy-nilly delete all comments that we don't like, as (for example) does. But as I said in that nice quote of mine about discovering Truth, I think that it's usually better to consistently apply moderation policies which allow for a substantial diversity of ideas. And that's what strives to do, tempered by clearly-stated and reasonable (we believe) limitations such as the prohibition on contentious-hardfork-implementing software. Again, if you don't agree with policy, there are many alternatives to and you could even create your own. Due to Reddit's general unsuitability for serious discussion, I doubt that any sizable subreddit will remain usable without a fair bit of moderation, but you're free to try it.

Yeah, it's been clear to me for a long time that Reddit is basically the perfect manipulation platform, and is widely used as such by advertisers, political groups, etc. People *feel* the Reddit groupthink strongly, but the group is very easy to manufacture using vote manipulation and sockpuppets. tries to improve this somewhat with moderation, vote-score hiding, uncollapsed comments, etc., but it's a real uphill battle.
The underlying problem is that Reddit relies on easily-gameable *global* vote scores, and gives moderators no way to defend against bad vote behavior. I see three possible solutions to this problem:
* Prevent votes from being manipulated. This seems very difficult or impossible, and you still end up with the problem where the actual voter pool becomes mismatched from the intended voter pool. For example, Reddit has seen that some readers of do not appreciate the mostly-legitimate upvotes of submissions. Similarly, many subreddits are created to be serious, but then they eventually find that their voting pool becomes filled with people who appreciate funny articles/comments more than serious ones, resulting in ordering other than what the community's original population intended.
* Make voting scores non-global by changing them so that they are calculated based on a per-user web of trust. For example, the system might automatically create a level-0 trust list for you by taking the list of everyone you've upvoted more than 5 separate times, and then recursively building up a trust network by going through their trust lists. Only votes by people in your trust network would count. If you go down many levels (4-7), your trust network will be very large even if your level-0 trust list is quite small. This would make manipulation much more difficult, and it also makes vote scores and voting more meaningful. Although trust networks would be very large, it is possible that people would end up somewhat insulated from very different opinions in this system, but to be honest I think that this is what most Reddit users want, even if they wouldn't admit it; voting/ranking of any kind is probably incompatible with serious and challenging discussions.
* Give moderators more editorial control so that they can defend against vote manipulation more actively. For example, moderators could manually order submissions/comments, and give them flair denoting them as "helpful" or whatever. Obviously this would not be good if you want an environment of totally-free discussion (for that, elimination of voting or the above idea are better), but in many cases it'd still result in useful communities.

That particular attack was done by exploiting two Tor flaws at once:
* A bug allowed a circuit's entry guard node to easily send a message through the circuit to the circuit's exit node.
* The Tor network is completely centralized, and relies 100% on the directory authorities preventing an attacker from creating many evil nodes. In this case, the software which runs the directory authorities as well as the people who were manually watching them were too willing to allow a bunch of new, suspicious-looking computers to become Tor nodes at around the same time. It turns out that these were in fact evil nodes tracking users.
The Tor devs have made changes to address both flaws, but it's very difficult (maybe ultimately impossible) to protect against even moderately powerful attackers on a low-latency point-to-point anonymity network. Anonymity networks can be stronger if they have much higher latency or if they use a distributed data store rather than point-to-point connections, but that's not Tor, and in fact research on improved anonymity networks has sadly become pretty inactive.

Bitcoin is a decentralized network like BitTorrent, not a company. There is no T&amp;C. You can send and receive bitcoins to/from anyone you want -- as long as you use your own software wallet (not a web wallet), there are no intermediaries to stop you. With Bitcoin, you truly can *be your own bank*.
However, Bitcoin *websites* like Coinbase or BitPay will have their own separate terms, many of which do disallow certain things. So converting between BTC and "normal" money is often the difficult part.

There are a large number of ideas floating around, but they're difficult to integrate into Bitcoin and/or wallets.
* It'd be a major improvement if CoinJoin and CoinSwap were integrated into wallet software, automatically mixing coins in the wallet. However, all CoinJoin/CoinSwap systems (eg. JoinMarket) have been at least partially centralized. Doing CoinJoin/CoinSwap transactions is *far* easier when you're able to use a centralized matchmaking server, though it should be possible (but difficult) to do in a decentralized way.
* It seems that it will be possible to do onion-style routing over Lightning, which would be a major improvement.
* Something like stealth addresses or BIP 47 would be an improvement. (These particular proposed technologies are maybe not ideal, however, since they create transactions/UTXOs that are probably unnecessarily large.)
* BTC-denominated blinded bearer certificates would be completely anonymous, but this requires some centralization. I really wish that someone would work on this, since although the centralization is far from ideal, it requires no modifications to Bitcoin itself, and the technology is pretty simple, so this could very quickly become a 90% solution to both anonymity and scaling. 
* Monero uses a ring signature scheme combined with stealth addresses, which I think is not *completely* impossible for an attacker to unravel, but it's pretty good. However, it has ridiculously poor scaling properties, making it unsuitable for Bitcoin proper. Maybe it could be done in Bitcoin as an auto-expiring sidechain (ie. a new sidechain would be created every year or two, and the old one would be abandoned).
* Mimblewimble uses elliptic curve moon-math to inseparably combine transactions. The problem remains of how to anonymously collect the transactions to combine. If you just broadcasted your transaction to the network and let miners combine them into a block like Bitcoin, then you'd gain very little anonymity, since someone could just save all of the individual transactions when they are first broadcast, allowing for the usual analysis. Mimblewimble needs to be combined with some high-latency GNUnet-style mix network in order to actually provide anonymity. This is a complex problem, though mix networks have already seen decades of research, so you wouldn't need to start totally from scratch. Mimblewimble also has very limited support for contracts, so it'd have to be done as a sidechain.
Note that sidechains can be made to be just as secure as Bitcoin, so I don't view it as a huge downside when something needs to be done as a sidechain.

Almost nobody is against increasing the max block size at some point. SegWit increases the max block size to about 2 MB, and beyond that the Core roadmap mentions flexcap, a dynamic max block size proposal.
Increasing it via hardfork is looking more difficult than it looked a couple of years ago, though. But it's always possible to do via softfork. One especially easy and gradual way to do it would be to create a higher-volume Bitcoin-security sidechain and then slowly move all transaction volume to that sidechain.
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:30:38
That's pretty much exactly the same as the sort of bitcoin-security sidechains I've talked about.
The main thing I think you're missing is that it's not a stable situation for some section of full nodes to hard-verify something and some section of full nodes not to verify it. I recently [talked about this](


Softforks are done with the goal of getting almost all full nodes to eventually upgrade. If a significant portion never upgrade, then we're in a dangerous situation in which a majority of miners could break the new rules and split the currency.

Tor is one of the few doing really-active research, but IMO Tor is basically a dead end. Many improvements to Tor can be made, for sure, but I just don't think that its basic design can ever offer all that much security.

This definitely isn't possible with any address whose public key has already been revealed, which includes all mined coins in Bitcoin's early years (because the client used to use `&lt;pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG` outputs in mined blocks). It might also not be possible *at all*, though it's at least conceivable that some way of securing addresses with unknown public keys could be found.


Note that I only support this *if* ECDSA becomes blatantly broken. Right now there is no quantum computer in existence that is even remotely a threat, and I wouldn't be surprised if a threatening quantum computer still doesn't exist anywhere on Earth in 50 years. People often act as though quantum computers capable of attacking crypto are right around the corner, but there's no solid evidence yet that such a computer is even *possible*. Even the tiny, experimental quantum computers in existence now 1) cannot be used to attack crypto because their quantum computations are only correct x% of the time (where x is &gt;50% but much less than 100%), which is incompatible with the crypto-busting quantum algorithms; and 2) must be cooled to near absolute zero. Quite likely, this isn't something that anonymous hackers are going to be able to use to steal bitcoins for 100+ years.
Of course, it is *possible*, and hope is not a contingency plan. So it'd be nice to have OP_LAMPORT or similar ASAP, and it's good to discuss plans for this contingency well in advance of when/if it becomes a crisis. Indeed, I do think that *if* 1M+ probably-lost coins were obviously going to be *imminently* stolen due to ECDSA weaknesses, then it'd be appropriate to destroy these coins before they can all be stolen, after giving their owners as much time as possible to move them to secure addresses first.

I haven't looked into this super closely, but I suspect that if an attacker only controls myTrezor, then they can only do stuff like:
* Tricking you into giving them your recovery phrase, etc. (Via phishing-style techniques.)
* Tricking you into thinking that you received BTC that you didn't.
* Tracking your addresses and transactions.
My concern would be an attack like this:
* An attacker secretly gains control of myTrezor and the Trezor firmware signing key.
* SatoshiLabs puts out a firmware update.
* The attacker simultaneously targets *you* specifically, and delivers only to you a modified firmware version via myTrezor which steals all of your BTC.
AFAICT, there's no way to defend against this with the current firmware update system. One way that it could be prevented would be for the Trezor device's screen to display a hash of the firmware update image before applying it, which you can research and maybe even do a deterministic build to recreate (if Trezor supported this).
(I think that all current hardware wallets are vulnerable to the same attack, not just Trezor.)

It wasn't really recognized as one of the main bottlenecks at the time of gmaxwell's roadmap about a year ago, but since then the growth in the UTXO set has been accelerating at a worrying rate, and as a result it has started to become apparent that the performance of the Bitcoin Core chainstate database (aka UTXO database) is not scaling all that well as it grows, in part because less and less of it typically fits in memory. The performance of the chainstate database is critical, as it is accessed and edited very extensively in verification. *Some* improvements to the chainstate database are probably possible, but at some level of UTXO-set growth it becomes a major problem unlikely be resolved even by a perfectly-performing database -- some experts think that a 2MB non-witness limit might start to approach this level if UTXO growth is not somehow limited in other ways (mainly due to deliberate attacks or special stupidity, not so much normal transactions, though normal transactions can also cause issues here, especially at even greater max block sizes).
The storage burden is also a concern, since *all* full nodes, even ones with pruning, have to store the whole UTXO set.

nSequence is part of the **input**. It has existed since the beginning of Bitcoin, but it was originally intended for something else (*replacement*) which is now mostly obsolete. That's why it has the confusing name "sequence", even though it's not often used for sequencing transactions nowadays. BIP68 *repurposed* nSequence to provide relative locktime, but the old name of the field is still used.
Having relative locktime on its own is occasionally useful, but usually you need to enforce locktime or relative-locktime in the **output** rather than the input. CSV and its non-relative-locktime counterpart, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV), are part of the the output.
Example of locktime alone: You pre-sign a transaction sending all BTC from output A to a chosen heir, but it has a locktime far in the future. If you die, then your heir can claim the BTC after the locktime expires. If you don't die, then you can spend the BTC from output A yourself anytime before the locktime expires, which also invalidates your heir's transaction.
Example of relative locktime + CSV: You create an address where any BTC sent to it can be claimed by an heir after sitting in the address for x years if not spent by you beforehand. The timer starts when the BTC arrives in the address and stops when it is sent out of the address, even if you just send the BTC back to the same address.
The first example constrains a *pre-signed transaction*, so it only needs to affect the input, and it only needs lockTime (relative or absolute). The second example constrains all *bitcoins sent to an address*. An address is a way of specifying an output script, so you're going to need CSV or CLTV. When *spending* BTC sent to such an address, the input of the spending transaction will have to use lockTime or relative lockTime if/as required by CLTV/CSV. CLTV works *with* lockTime, and CSV works *with* relative lockTime.

That's normal, antivirus software is notoriously unreliable. If you look back, every release of Bitcoin Core is followed by similar complaints.

I agree somewhat with the quote. The subsidy will be sufficient for at least 8 more years, I think. Mining rewards are something to keep in the back of your mind, but probably they shouldn't be the primary factor in any decision-making.
But it *is* critical to keep the cost to run a full node low enough that the majority of the economy is backed by independent full nodes. Otherwise Bitcoin degenerates into a highly insecure system dominated by miners. Keeping the load on full nodes low will in itself probably always lead to contention for block space, therefore causing a fee market. But the *goal* (from my perspective at least) is not a fee market.
@_date: 2016-12-16 02:34:27


Under the standard Bitcoin cryptocurrency model, that isn't possible. If some full nodes validate the sidechain and apply the same principle as on Bitcoin where invalid blocks are absolutely rejected forever, then if a majority of miners fail to validate the sidechain at any point, a permanent split can develop between full nodes which validate the sidechain and those that don't.
If you want the sidechain to have full Bitcoin-level security, then at least the vast majority of the full-node economy needs to hard-verify the sidechain. If you don't want to require this, then *no* full node can hard-verify the sidechain or else you get a split possibility; the sidechain must be SPV-security or semi-centralized.
Peter Todd has in the past proposed a totally different cryptocurrency model where miners do not validate transactions in blocks, and blocks are not assumed to contain only valid transactions. Miners can put whatever data they want in blocks, and they provide only timestamping. This is sufficient for a decentralized cryptocurrency to function, but it requires everyone to be a full node (or something similar to a full node) so that valid transactions can be distinguished from invalid nonsense in blocks. Under this model, Peter has also proposed his [Tree Chains]( idea, which is somewhat similar to what you're talking about. These ideas are not super popular among other Bitcoin experts because they are major departures from how Bitcoin works now, so far it's been found difficult to rigorously think about the security and other implications of this model, and for other reasons.

In reality, I'm pretty sure that at least a handful of people are always going to store the whole chain. Losing parts of it isn't really something that concerns me.


Storage would be broadcast along with IPs in `addr` messages, so for each block you'd know the nodes who claim to own it, even without connecting to them. (Though nodes should probably still store blocks randomly, not in order to fill perceived holes, since otherwise there might be possible attacks.)

Definitely using a hardware wallet.


AFAIK, none of them support it very nicely. What you can do is that some of them support some lightweight wallets, and some lightweight wallets let you use a single trusted node. So you can run a full node and then set it up as hardware wallet &lt;-&gt; lightweight wallet &lt;-&gt; your full node &lt;-&gt; Bitcoin network.

There is only one Bitcoin, and AFAICT it is best defined by:
1. Take the behavior of Bitcoin 0.1, which defines the original consensus rules.
2. Whenever a supermajority (&gt;95% or so) of the economy adds/removes/changes a consensus rule, the change becomes part of Bitcoin's consensus rules.
3. The best valid block chain describes the state of the Bitcoin currency, with "best" and "valid" being defined by the current consensus rules.
In all softforks and hardforks, there is a period of risk where the currency could split. For example, in a softfork the miners could signal readiness, and the softfork could be activated, but then the majority of miners could start breaking the new rules (despite them signalling readiness) before a supermajority of the economy starts enforcing it. In a hardfork, the rule change could activate while some significant chunk of the economy refuses to accept it. (The risk is much greater in hardforks, especially with a short lead-up time.) In such cases, the status quo before the softfork/hardfork is the correct Bitcoin, and immediately rolling back the hardfork/softfork is necessary. This has arguably occurred one time previously (by accident), with the BIP 50 disaster.
In case of a failed hardfork/softfork as described in the above paragraph -- one in which an altcoin is created -- it is *possible* to still change the consensus rules by convincing a supermajority of the Bitcoin economy that this altcoin is Bitcoin. This satisfies point  in the definition of Bitcoin above. I call this *economic redefinition* as opposed to *consensus*, and it should never be done except perhaps in the most dire of circumstances, as it risks splitting Bitcoin permanently. The proper way to do softforks and hardforks is to get sufficient agreement for the changes beforehand and to structure the activation of the changes so that failure (ie. creation of an altcoin) seems nearly impossible.
Back to the original PoW-change scenario: If a significant chunk of the economy stuck with the miners, then a good case could be made that the sha256 miners are mining on the correct network/currency, and the new-PoW network/currency is an altcoin. But this whole hypothetical situation is based on the assumption that miners are acting in a clearly evil way, so I don't see why *anyone* but the miners themselves would continue on with that chain, except perhaps due to temporary ignorance of the situation. In this emergency scenario, the hardfork could probably be completed in a matter of days, since a supermajority of the economy would very quickly adopt it.
In more practical terms, if the vast majority of Bitcoin users/websites switch to the new PoW, then the sha256 miners will be mining blocks and coins that ~nobody will accept, so it's as if they don't exist.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:54:53
Note that you have to have created the wallet with 0.13. If you created the wallet with an earlier version and then upgrade Bitcoin Core, the wallet will *not* be upgraded, and you'll still have to use the old keypool rules (ie. you need to backup every 100 transactions or so by default).

Different manufacturers became popular, and (as far as I've heard) the few people who had been pursuing altPoW were busy and/or distracted while this was happening, and never got around to pushing the new manufacturers toward altPoW support.
I think it was a good idea, so this is a bit of a shame. Hardware is always advancing, though, so it could perhaps happen again if someone wants to work on it.
For people who don't know: The idea was that each manufacturer would invent a different PoW function and then add support for it in their hardware. For example, maybe instead of SHA256(SHA256(header)) their alt PoW would be SHA256(F(SHA256(header)), where F is some random one-to-one function. But this alt PoW would remain *secret* to everyone outside of the company. Then if some government or whatever starts producing its own super-powerful ASICs in order to overpower the Bitcoin mining network, all of the manufacturers can publish their alt PoWs, and Bitcoin's PoW can be changed to "any one of (ManufacterA's PoW OR ManufactuerB'S PoW OR ... OR SHA-3)". Then the attacker is excluded, but most legitimate Bitcoin miners can set their hardware to start using the altPoW, and these miners will be unaffected. Several manufacturers did support an alt PoW in the past, but I don't think that any of the top manufacturers today support one.

Reassigning the coins is completely antithetical to Bitcoin; I'd never support that. It'd also be a hardfork rather than a softfork.
If the coins are stolen and then mostly held by thousands of separate hackers, then that wouldn't be so bad. If the coins are stolen and then immediately dumped on the market, then that'd be very damaging, but survivable. A more dangerous possibility is that the coins will be stolen by a few governments or other large anti-freedom entities. Once you build a quantum computer of the necessary size, it shouldn't take that long to break each key -- maybe a few hours/days per key at the very start, or something in that area. It's distinctly *not* like brute-forcing passwords, where there's a varying amount of time required per key, and any halfway-decent password will take a lot of time and power. So it's likely that the first few organizations to build a quantum computer of the right size will steal *all* of the lost bitcoins, and I consider that unacceptable.

The difficulty when Bitcoin was first created was exactly 1. This is the minimum difficulty in Bitcoin -- even if blocks are being generated too slowly, difficulty won't adjust lower than 1. Difficulty 4 would be 4 times more difficult than the original difficulty, and today's difficulty of 310 billion is 310 billion times more difficult than the original difficulty.
Note that the difficulty number is just for human consumption. It isn't actually used in the protocol. The protocol instead uses the concept of a *target*, a very large number which block hashes, when interpreted as another very large number, need to be less than or equal to in order to be valid. The difficulty number is defined as target_at_difficulty_1 / current_target, where target_at_difficulty_1 is a large number with no special significance other than being the maximum target (ie. minimum difficulty).

For a block chain to reliably converge on one global chain, any latency needs to be *completely dwarfed* by the target block interval.

I think that people are currently planning for pretty short locktimes, which will probably necessitate these third-party monitors for most people. But I wonder if there's really any huge downside to increasing the locktime. If it was set to a month, for example, then you'd only have to bring your Lightning wallet online once per month. The downside is that there's a risk of money getting tied up for a month if your counterparty becomes uncooperative, but perhaps this will be sufficiently rare to not actually be a problem.

I've never used Tails. Looking into it more, I think that any changes you make to torrc might be wiped when you restart the computer, which would be annoying.
Instead of restarting tor, you can run `sudo killall -SIGHUP tor`, which will cause Tor to reload its configuration without stopping.
To figure out the proper group, try to find the file called `cached-microdesc-consensus` using a command like `sudo find / -name cached-microdesc-consensus`. Then use `ls -l` on that file. The group owner of that file is probably the group that Tor is running as, and that should be the group that you should add the Bitcoin user to.
If the group ownership stuff causes trouble, there's an alternative way to give Bitcoin access to the Tor control port:
* Invent a long, secure password which we'll call PASSWORD.
* Run `tor --hash-password PASSWORD` and copy the output hash which we'll call HASHED_PASSWORD.
* Instead of CookieAuthentication and CookieAuthFileGroupReadable, put ` HashedControlPassword HASHED_PASSWORD` in torrc.
* Put `torpassword=PASSWORD` in bitcoin.conf.
(There's also a way to disable authentication on the Tor control port, but if anything evil gets access to the Tor control port, then it can easily deanonymize you, so that's not a good idea.)


I guess so, though maybe there's some other stuff in their torrc which would interfere.
I imagine that a lot of people who use Tails have wanted to create hidden services. It's a pretty common thing. You might try joining their IRC and asking them how you're actually supposed to do it, which I'd guess is different from what I've described. Maybe there's a GUI interface for it. If you find instructions for running a web server on Tails, just replace port 80 or 443 in the instructions with Bitcoin's 8333, and then follow the rest of method 2 on the wiki page.

If the sidechain is a Bitcoin-security sidechain, then it is essentially the same as increasing the max block size in Bitcoin proper, since all full nodes need to also be full nodes on the sidechain. So the same arguments against creating huge blocks on the main chain today apply to doing the same thing on a Bitcoin-security sidechain.
With the other two types of sidechain, especially federated-security sidechains, a lot of volume would be possible. In fact, I [proposed a design]( for a high-volume sidechain that could be created very quickly to address the concerns of some people that Bitcoin might not be able to support enough volume. But compared to Lightning, it's less efficient (ie. more unrelated third-parties have to deal with your transactions), less private, and less secure.

Great! I've always loved this concept, but I was very concerned about counterfeiting with the original OpenDime device. This looks like it will be a large improvement.
However, I don't like the idea of having just one verification key that will be put on all devices. I don't believe that any of these high-security data-storage devices are truly impossible to read from. There have been cases of persistent people reading keys from TPMs and such. If you have one very-high-value key on all devices, then someone is eventually going to use an electron microscope or whatever to reconstruct it, and then all devices will become counterfeitable. I recommend instead that each device have its own anti-counterfeiting keypair that is signed indirectly by a master key, with signatures happening in a tree structure like:
                         Master key
                     /              \
         Batch 1 key                  Batch 2 key
        /      \      \               /       \      \
    Device 1-1 Device 1-2 ...     Device 2-1 Device 2-2 ...
The device would provide its own response to a challenge plus the chain of signatures from the master key to its individual public key.
Then OpenDime should publish a list of revoked device keys and batch keys. The recipient needs to be online anyway to verify the amount of BTC on the device, so it won't be much additional work to have it download the revocation list every day and check against that as well whenever verifying a device. A device would be revoked if it ever becomes clear that someone has extracted its verification key and is using it for counterfeiting. (Facing the possibility of revocation, maybe nobody would even go to the trouble of extracting a verification key, and the revocation list would forever remain empty. This would be ideal.)
Using separate batch keys instead of the master key directly limits the amount of time that the master key needs to be exposed to a running computer.
(x.509 works like this, and could maybe be used, with the OpenDime master key being the only top-level CA.)
The device should be able to sign both its address and be able to sign a user-supplied challenge. (Eg. maybe the challenger would be allowed to provide any 256-bit salt that the device must add to any other data to be signed.) Otherwise the address signature could be replayed. Adding a time to the address signature seems potentially risky, since it'd be insecure to trust the challenger to give the correct time, and it may be difficult for the device itself to securely maintain the time.

For transactions, QC can be resolved by a softfork adding a QC-resistant checksig opcode. For mining, I predict that traditional computers will be faster than quantum computers for a long time because Grover's algorithm isn't that good, and the first quantum computers will be really slow. Once quantum computers are actually competitive for mining, they will hopefully be available to the general public, and so mining will work more-or-less the same as today, just with a massively higher difficulty. So I don't think that it'll be necessary to change the PoW due to QC.
I suspect that a hardfork is only strictly required for changing the PoW, though it may be desirable in other cases.

Everyone knows that we need to reduce the max block size, but is a one-time drop to 300 kB really the best way? Maybe miners should vote on whether it drops 1% or 2% each month; or it should use an algorithm which attempts to double average transaction fees each year.

Yeah, 1MB forever is entirely survivable.
Lightning relies on all participants making a few on-chain transactions every once in a while, so while all current traffic and then some would comfortably work, it wouldn't scale indefinitely on the main chain.
Probably one or more high-volume sidechains would be created for both direct transfers and eventually any Lightning channel-open/close transactions that don't fit on the main chain. There are three types of sidechain that could be used for this:
* SPV-security sidechains and drivechains rely on the majority of Bitcoin miners being trustworthy. A majority of miners could steal all BTC on the sidechain. Bitcoin proper doesn't have this flaw. I think that this type of sidechain would only be reasonable for small values: experimentation, microtransactions, etc.
* Federated-security sidechains use signing by a group of centralized functionaries instead of mining. If there are many functionaries in many different countries, then IMO this is more secure than the above sidechain types, even though it is technically centralized. It can also have very short times between blocks. This'd be OK for somewhat higher values IMO.
* Bitcoin-security sidechains have the same security as Bitcoin, but this requires a softfork in Bitcoin, and then all Bitcoin full nodes must also be full nodes on the sidechain, so maybe this violates your assumption of no successful softforks/hardforks. Though the previously-mentioned sidechain types can usually be *converted* into Bitcoin-security sidechains at any point after their creation, so this is an especially easy upgrade path: by the time there's a desire to make a sidechain Bitcoin-secure, it'll probably be well-tested and popular.
Alternatively or additionally to sidechains, you could do some of these things:
* Blinded bearer certificates allow a bank (which may actually be a multisig arrangement requiring signatures from many independent parties) to issue bearer certificates which can be redeemed for on-chain BTC or transferred to other people. Transferring bearer certificates involves giving the recipient a signed transaction which they then register with the bank to prevent double-spending. Because blind signing is used, this is more anonymous than Bitcoin, Monero, and even Mimblewimble. It is also extremely efficient/scalable. A wallet based on these certificates might ask the user to say something like, "I trust Bank1 with x BTC, Bank2 with y BTC, etc.", and then the wallet could automatically diversify among certificates issued by these different banks in order to reduce overall risk.
* Everyone could open a very-long-lasting payment channel with one hub of their choice, and then there would be a network of long-lasting payment channels between all of the hubs. Transferring BTC to someone would go from you, to your hub, maybe through some intermediate hubs, to the recipient's hub, to them; all through payment channels which probably already exist. There would be only a few main hubs, though the only barrier to creating new hubs would be somewhat higher costs, sort of like how email works. This is called the hub-and-spoke idea, and it results in significantly fewer on-chain transactions than Lightning, which doesn't have hubs.
* Before the current incarnation of Ripple, the idea of Ripple was something different. It was sort of like Lightning, but using debt and trust rather than guaranteed payment channels. You would say, "I'm willing to loan 2 BTC to Alice and Bob", and then maybe Bob would say "I'm willing to loan 1 BTC to Carol". Then if Carol sends 1 BTC to you, this is executed by Bob loaning 1 BTC to Carol and you loaning 1 BTC to Bob, so no on-chain transaction is necessary. Later on, if Bob wants to pay you, you just reduce his debt, again without needing an on-chain transaction. On-chain settlements would occasionally be necessary, but as the trust graph grows they become increasingly rare. If 100% of Bitcoin users used this system and formed a connected trust graph, then I think that no on-chain transactions would be strictly necessary. The main downside of this system is that it is somewhat fragile (ie. if you trust someone *incorrectly*, then you can lose BTC).  (Note that this has very little to do with the design of today's Ripple, whose usage of the name Ripple was a horrible bait-and-switch.)
Now, I don't think that it'd be very *good* for Bitcoin to be 1MB-forever:
* Most of the above solutions have some downside, usually increased centralization. While centralization in upper layers is better than allowing *Bitcoin proper* to become insecure or centralized, it's still not ideal. Lightning is nice because it combines many of the benefits of these more centralized systems without actually requiring any centralization/trust, but it does require some on-chain transactions. So it'd be really good if Bitcoin can at least handle enough transaction volume for most people to comfortably use Lightning. And in fact I suspect that increasing the max block size to levels required by Lightning will, when necessary, not actually be controversial. (We're not even close to needing this right now.)
* Switching from today's Bitcoin to a mostly-settlement-only Bitcoin would be really jarring. There's a lot of distance between where we are now and where we'd need to be in that sort of environment: in wallet design, user expectations/training, the overall ecosystem, etc. If all work on scaling suddenly stopped today, I think that we would quite quickly find the need to make this transition, and most Bitcoiners would find the process to be very uncomfortable.
* I'm not sure about this, but I kinda feel that it'd be ideal for people to always be able to do large transactions (&gt;$100 or so) directly on-chain. It'd be like the difference between wire transfers and ACH transfers in the US. Then you can keep most of your BTC directly on the Bitcoin main chain as a sort of ultra-high-security "Swiss bank account", and you don't need to rely *too* much on possibly-less-secure layer-2 solutions.

Improvements have constantly been made since Bitcoin 0.1. Bitcoin 0.1 would randomly fail when given even *1MB* blocks, but later improvements allowed for such large blocks. Today, especially thanks to some major new features over the last ~year including pruning and compact blocks, 4MB of block data seems pretty reasonable. And SegWit will in fact allow for blocks up to 4MB in size (though for now they'll usually be no larger than ~2MB). Though the issue of UTXO growth is still not resolved, so raising the max *non-witness* block size might require more work. I was just commenting on this issue [here](
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:18:53


That's still dangerous. Common mistakes when doing that include:
* Not realizing that an imported private key isn't covered by the wallet's BIP 32 seed/mnemonic, leading to insufficient backups, and therefore losses.
* You import a key and send some BTC, but don't realize that the wallet has generated a new change address instead of sending BTC back to the paper wallet. Then you shred the wallet (which you intended as a temporary vehicle for your paper wallet transactions) and lose your BTC.
I've seen people fall into both of those traps many times. As I mentioned previously, it's also really bad to constantly reuse the same address. People just shouldn't normally deal with individual keys.


Currently, there is no perfect solution. All existing wallets are flawed in one way or another, so you always have to accept some trade-offs.
For people just getting started with Bitcoin, the Green Address apps are pretty good. Once you have more than a few BTC, I think that the best solution for most people/situations is to either buy a hardware wallet or put a fresh install of Linux on a dedicated old computer along with an HD wallet like Electrum. Write down the seed mnemonic given by the hardware/software wallet and put it in a safe deposit box or something. For most people, the two biggest threats are loss and malware, which are pretty well-addressed by the preceding solution. However, with this solution: privacy is terrible, security is still sub-optimal, and the actual wallet functionality of wallets other than Bitcoin Core is limited. A better solution (though still not ideal in some ways) would be to use Bitcoin Core as the front-end wallet for a hardware wallet device, but I don't think that any hardware wallets support this yet, and Bitcoin Core is currently uncomfortable to use due to its significant resource usage.

Sending to another one of your addresses is possible. Bitcoin Core even has a special icon for it. In the absence of other hints, there's no way for a third-party to know that the bitcoins aren't leaving one person's wallet.
If you receive multiple times to one address and then you send all of those coins to a new address, then only the first address's public key will be revealed. The amount of BTC secured by a publicly-known public key is therefore kept low; lower than the default coin selection behavior which is willing to use only some of the coins secured by a particular address, leaving coins secured by a publicly-known public key. However, I see no benefit whatsoever to making a *special* transaction for this as opposed to just spending all of these coins whenever you want to make an outgoing transaction, and then allowing the default change behavior to send all change to a new address. And I see only a small, theoretical benefit to worrying about publicly-known public keys at all.

Mining, not really. If you really put a lot of time and money into mining you might be able to *get* a decent amount of BTC, but it will be at a loss (ie. you'd be better-off just buying the BTC).

The obvious answer is that it prevents spam transactions from creating gigantic blocks which would overwhelm the network. But that's the easy answer...
A full node is Bitcoin software which enforces all of the rules of Bitcoin, such as the 21 million BTC limit. If you're not running a full node, then you have to trust someone else to tell you which transactions are valid, since you can't check yourself. For example, the blockchain.info wallet trusts blockchain.info to tell you which transactions are valid; the MultiBit wallet trusts that the majority of miners are mining valid transactions; and Electrum trusts your randomly-selected Electrum server (which anyone can run).
The larger blocks are, the more difficult it is to run a full node. Even today, it often takes several days to initially set up a full node because you need to download and verify 100 GB of historical blocks. Once you have a full node up and running, you have to download and verify 1-2 MB per 10 minutes, and some other full node out there has to upload this to you. Running a full node requires substantial upload &amp; download bandwidth, CPU power, disk space, and random-access disk accesses.
As fewer and fewer people use their own full node to handle Bitcoin transactions, verification of transactions becomes more and more centralized. Eventually, nearly every person and business will be relying on someone else to verify transactions for them. That is a *very* dangerous level of centralization. If most people are using wallets like MultiBit which trust miners, then miners become rulers of the network, and they can do anything they want. (It's a common misunderstanding that this is already the case, but in fact miners today are very limited in what they can do.) If most people are using wallets like blockchain.info, then these handful of central verifiers are in fact the ones who decide who owns which bitcoins.
It's *already* worrying how many people are trusting others rather than running their own full nodes. I would be very surprised if you (the OP) are running a full node, for example. Even many exchanges are relying on centralized third-parties like BitGo for verification. If this trend continues, Bitcoin will lose its status as a decentralized currency and become merely another currency controlled by a handful of what are essentially banks. When verification is centralized like this, all of Bitcoin's good properties become worthless. With traditional money you can't do things like escrow or time-locked transactions without a trusted third-party, you can't do brainwallets, and with fiat currencies you have to trust the central bank not to inflate the currency. Bitcoin has these nice features now, but they lose their security if Bitcoin is just a project of a handful of centralized banks.
If we assume that the current situation is OK (though IMO it's really not), and that the bottleneck for running a full node will always be bandwidth (this is probably not true, at least not until certain technical improvements are made), then Bitcoin will be secure as long as the full-node bandwidth requirements don't increase by more than the global rate of bandwidth increase. Bitcoin experts [estimate]( that worldwide bandwith capacities will grow by about 17% per year. So in an environment with no max block size, we'd need for transaction volume to grow by less than 17% per year on average or else fewer and fewer people will use full nodes and we would get closer and closer to severe centralization. I think that this low level of growth seems very unlikely without a hard limit.
Therefore, the only way to keep Bitcoin decentralized and therefore secure is to make sure that running a full node does not become increasingly expensive, and ideally becomes even cheaper/easier than it is now. Restricting the max block block size is a big part of this, though there are other factors such as the UTXO-set size to take into account, and to some degree full-node operation can be made cheaper via other technical improvements. It is true that limitations such as the max block size might make certain transactions impossible with Bitcoin for the time being, which is regrettable. However, in the long run it's a choice between that and a mostly-centralized Bitcoin which is probably *worse* than fiat currencies. Additionally, there are various proposed off-chain solutions such as Lightning which will eventually be able to fill the demand for higher transaction volume, lower fees, lower confirmation times, and microtransactions.
Some additional points to address common misunderstandings:
* The issue of full nodes is not *capacity*. Spinning up 1000 full nodes on EC2 wouldn't help anything. The issue is that *real people* aren't using full nodes for their own transactions, but are rather trusting third-parties.
* Miners do not have the same incentives as normal Bitcoin users. They want to make as much money as possible, and they don't necessarily have a huge stake in the system. They're not required to hold BTC, and many miners sell much of their BTC as soon as they can -- in some cases they *must* sell a lot of BTC in order to cover expenses. Therefore, it is foolhardy to just assume that miners will act in the best interests of Bitcoin as a whole by for example refusing to accept fee-paying transactions because this'd create too-large blocks or preserving the core principles of Bitcoin in an environment in which miners have absolute power over Bitcoin.

It hasn't been implemented because it's not as straightforward as it might look. For example, while you might initially think that it'd be OK to arrange the UTXOs in a simple binary hash tree, this has pretty poor performance. And everyone will need to use the same data structure -- changing it would probably require a hardfork. So there's long been a debate about what the data structure should actually look like. AFAIK, Peter Todd's specially-designed [merbinner tree]( is currently the preferred solution.
Also, probably UTXO commitments should be added at the same time as [TXO comittments](

Bcash was never an issue. Although I think that it's based on stupid ideas, I've been pretty supportive of the effort (eg. I mentioned it neutrally in all of my ultra-high-profile posts on the matter), and I encourage bigblockers to use it, promote it, and try to compete with Bitcoin that way.
The real issue is bait-and-switch stuff like B2X, BU, XT, etc., which tries to *trick* people into giving up their individual sovereignty. This kind of thing will constantly be happening; the powers that be want very badly to co-opt or destroy Bitcoin. If/when B2X is defeated, I'm sure that the next attempt will be right around the corner. But although victory is not *guaranteed*, Bitcoin does have an innate resistance against being corrupted. The "best-case scenario" for B2X supporters is that they will create the biggest catastrophe in Bitcoin history, involving weeks of effective downtime, millions of dollars in lost BTC, lawsuits against basically every site which holds user BTC, and at the end of it they will have tricked a slim majority of the economy into using their currency via bait-and-switch on big sites, while the remaining economy supports only the real Bitcoin as a thorn in their side forever. I tend to think that big sites like Coinbase are not *quite* so incompetent that they will fail to realize this before it's too late. So I think that B2X has a substantially lower probability of "success" than XT did when that takeover attempt was conducted, though we should never become complacent.
Even in the very-unlikely worst-case scenario described above, Bitcoin can definitely survive. Plans are already in place, code written. It would be a very annoying ordeal, however, and a major setback.

You said "no-coding", which isn't really possible with SHA-256. You *could* do it with a calculator, assuming the calculator can handle 256-bit numbers, but you're just going to be acting like a computer and executing the SHA-256 procedure yourself.


That doesn't make sense. If you know the checksum of a 15-word BIP39 mnemonic, then that only reduces the number of possible mnemonics from a 39-digit number to a 38-digit number. The checksum is computed over *all* of the non-checksum data, not from individual words, and even if you know almost all of the non-checksum data, the checksum is equally likely to be any of its possible values.

Yes, you can do a softfork without any mining support by setting a flag day and upgrading a supermajority of the economy before the flag day. This is how Satoshi always did softforks. SegWit could be done in this way.
See my post [here]( for an explanation of how miner-driven softforks change the consensus rules.
Miner signalling is useful in softforks because if the majority of miners enforce a softfork, then the softfork can't possibly cause the network/currency to split. A flag-day softfork can split the network if enough of the economy doesn't actually upgrade. Recent softforks have checked that x% of miners are promising to enforce it before having full nodes start enforcing it so that we can be reasonably sure that a majority of miners are going to enforce it along with nodes. If, after activation, a majority of miners aren't actually enforcing it, and if a supermajority of the economy isn't enforcing it, then the network could badly split. This is very unlikely in a softfork with miner signalling (especially if the threshold is high), but much more likely in a flag day softfork. That doesn't mean that flag day softforks are necessarily bad, but they're certainly more difficult to do safely.
In a hardfork, miners can't prevent a split as they can in a softfork, so signalling isn't very useful. As far as I can see, the only reasonable argument for miner signalling in a hardfork is so nodes can see that at least *some* other entities are supporting a hardfork that they're thinking about activating, but it's not as if x% of miner support implies any particular economic support. Coin voting would be a better estimate of economic support, though still imperfect, and I have several other reservations about that idea.

You can have the percentage reduce after some time has passed, though I'm not sure if there's an advantage of doing that over just reducing the percentage entirely, since if an attacker got 60% then he could just deny service until the percentage automatically goes down far enough for him to steal the BTC.

With *most* wallets it won't, but it depends on the wallet. In wallets that work like Bitcoin Core, you need both the wallet.dat file and the passphrase in order to access the funds. In wallets that work like Electrum, you need either (both the wallet file and the passphrase) OR the seed/mnemonic to access the funds. But some wallets, especially Web-based wallets like blockchain.info, might allow access with just the passphrase.

IIRC OT actually predates Bitcoin, and all the way back when I got into Bitcoin, the OT inventor was trying to popularize a mix between OT and Bitcoin. But it never caught on, I think in part because it's too overdesigned/complicated. But maybe Stashcrypto will work.

IMO we're pretty far from IBD being so slow that nodes can never catch up. The main issue with IBD now is that it discourages people from running full nodes at all, especially as their personal wallet. Making Core 90% usable immediately and then slowly doing IBD in the background would attract more users. Also, if syncing is done backward using UTXO commitments, then nodes would be able to become almost as secure as a true full node after only going back a year or two (it's very unlikely that the longest chain is invalid if its last year or two is valid).
Another use for rescanning is when you want to have several separate wallet.dat files with the same blocks/chainstate database.
I'm thinking of rescans using filterblock or similar, not just relying on UTXOs. For a pruned full node, transactions returned by filterblock can be 100% verified because they can be linked to a block that you know you've already fully verified. The only attack is omitting transactions and the various known privacy issues, both of which I suspect can be mostly mitigated if the rescan is done carefully.


That does sound useful.

This'd be a bit of work, but if someone were to set up a registered non-profit in the US for sending BTC to Venezuela, there'd be major tax advantages to this.

This is a super cool idea, and I've been tempted to buy some, but I'm put off by two problems:
* You can't back up the BTC stored in the devices. This is by design, and I'm not sure if it can really be resolved while preserving the desired properties, but it still gives me pause.
* More importantly, if these devices ever became popular for actual transactions, it'd be fairly easily possible for someone to create a copycat device which lies about its deposit address, either to steal deposited BTC or to be used as counterfeit BTC in a transaction. The OpenDime company should have a master key which should be used to sign (maybe indirectly in a tree arrangement) a unique public key per device. Then whenever the device gives out any data, it should be signed along with user-supplied salt/challenge data using the per-device key. Then you can confirm with much higher certainty that a device is actually legitimate.

For others' benefit: SegWit keeps the 1 MB non-witness limit (since removing it would be a hardfork), but then it also introduces the concept of a *weight* per transaction, and a 4 MB max weight per block. A transaction's weight is the total transaction size (witness + non-witness) plus three times the non-witness size of the transaction. Therefore, it is theoretically possible, though probably unlikely in reality, to have more than 3MB of witness data in a block.

We don't know *for sure*, but that is what Satoshi [said]( I think that ~2 years of development is plausible for an individual's hobby project if he spent much of his free time working on it. Exactly how much time would've been required really depends on how easily he came to the details. If he'd had the wiki Protocol Documentation page sitting in front of him, then writing the code itself might only take a few hundred hours, but obviously he had to build up the design from scratch, and I'm not sure how long that'd take.

They repeatedly supported attempts to take over Bitcoin, such as "NYA". Bitcoin was created to change the world, not to make people lots of money, and bitcoin.org does not need to point people to companies which have proven that they are fundamentally opposed to the principles behind Bitcoin just so that it's easier to "onboard" people.

He could've just read the manuals for Boost, BDB, wxwidgets, etc. These manuals explain how to use the libraries properly: how best to open a TCP connection, how best to manage BDB databases, etc. He wouldn't have needed any particular past experience with those.
Bitcoin 0.1 was Windows-only, and developed using Visual C++. Microsoft uses MFC notation in most of their documentation.
Satoshi's most impressive programming feat was his awesome C++ serialization setup, which involved C++ templates and overloading as well as C macros and low-level manipulation of data structures. But I think it's plausible that he could've figured this out on his own with just a little independent research, maybe later in the 2-year development time in order to clean up code duplication.

That might help a little, but Lightning incentivizes something other than "the number of people/organizations running independent full nodes", which is what needs to be optimized.

Most people haven't previously been put into a situation in which they have to memorize something and there is *absolutely no recourse* if they forget. Memorizing something and remembering it for few weeks/months is fairly easy. But people don't realize just how easy it is to forget this stuff, even in the absence of injury (which is also a legitimate concern). A long time ago, I had a passphrase memorized for over a year and then somehow I just forget that it even existed until I wanted to use it, at which point I had totally forgotten it. I never did remember that passphrase, though thankfully the data I lost due to this wasn't especially valuable.
Also, people are really bad at creating strong passphrases. Any scheme that doesn't involve a software or hardware random number generator is going to be broken eventually. And Bitcoin seeds have to be *so* much stronger than normal passphrases, since you're going to have the entire world constantly attacking it; there's no intervening bank or whatever to put rate limits in place. All of the advice people hear about creating strong passwords is massively insufficient and inapplicable in the context of Bitcoin seeds.
I don't think that the concept of a brain wallet is *completely* without merit, but it's only appropriate in certain very rare cases as a last resort, with the knowledge that everything about brain wallets is extremely risky. It should definitely not be recommended to ordinary Bitcoin users.

A few people who say "flex cap" mean any dynamic max block size, where the max block size is not a fixed x MB, but changes. There are hundreds of different dynamic max block size proposals of varying quality.
When Bitcoin experts say "flexcap", they mean a more specific class of dynamic block size proposals where miners *can* create blocks above the baseline max block size, but there's some cost to doing this. As a totally arbitrary example, maybe they'd have to give up 1% of their subsidy for every 250 kB they increase the max block size for their block. This creates some wiggle room for varying periods of demand while also incentivizing miners not to go crazy with it. A flexcap relies on a baseline max block size (below which there is no extra cost for miners), which can be determined in any number of different ways. IIRC, gmaxwell's original flexcap proposal set the baseline max block size by looking at the flexcap-influenced actual block sizes over a long period of time. But there are many other ideas.

My pet theory is that Satoshi had only casual experience with programming prior to Bitcoin, but because he wanted to write Bitcoin, he read some high-quality C++ book cover-to-cover.

I'm not sure that I'm convinced that hardforks are *quite* as bad as this article implies, but the article makes many good points. Though one thing that's important to keep in mind is that if we can *never* hardfork, then miners de facto control the network. For example, right now the Chinese government could completely shut down Bitcoin (or worse) because the majority of mining power is located in China. The only defense against this is the credible threat of a PoW change, which can only be done via hardfork.

Not exactly, but that was the impression I always got. The idea that Satoshi was actually a group of people is mostly based on the idea that Bitcoin is *so* complex that you'd need a team of genius cryptographers and programmers to do it, which is exactly the sort of thinking this post is in opposition to. The core ideas would've been well-known to anyone with a crypto hobby, and the code itself is not insanely huge. Bitcoin 0.1 was about 15k lines of code, and that includes the full wallet GUI. For comparison, GNU less has about 17k lines of code. Most of the development would've been figuring out exactly how everything should work, not so much actually writing code.

There are theoretical solutions to all of the the problems potentially created by SegWit:
* For IBD, Core needs to either start up in lightweight mode or it needs to gradually become a full node by syncing backward with UTXO commitments.
* For storage, there's already pruning, but nobody wants to use pruning because it breaks rescan. Rescan is *really* useful. I think Core needs some low-bandwidth way of doing rescan with pruning enabled.
* For ensuring that there are block sources for IBD, sharding of historical block storage is needed.
(With compact blocks, I feel pretty confident that bandwidth won't be a major issue with SegWit.)
But the problems solved by the above solutions *already* exist. It's already the case that basically nobody wants to use Bitcoin Core as a wallet. The only people who do it are major enthusiasts and smart businesses. This is a really bad situation, but I'm not so convinced that SegWit's additional burden will make it much worse; I feel like the above solutions need to be implemented ASAP in any case.
On the other hand, there isn't a single wallet that's any good at avoiding stuck transactions. This has increasingly become an annoyance due to apparently-malicious spam transactions. Some wallets do insane things like simply *forgetting* stuck transactions, which could easily lead to major losses. Some like Bitcoin Core just keep the transaction stuck forever, and it's beyond the capability of most users to unstick such a transaction. The real solution to this is easy-to-use fee bumping by either the sender or recipient, but the wallet ecosystem is nowhere near this. SegWit's larger blocks will make it *much* more costly to disruptively spam transactions, and also smooth the normal fee continuum. This is the biggest short-term benefit of SegWit IMO.
Later on, I wouldn't mind seeing a reduced discount. 75% seems awfully high. I liked BlueMatt's idea from a while ago to set the max base block size to 2 MB and reduce the discount to 50% in a hardfork. (Maybe with something to prevent UTXO-set growth issues.) But for now, I think that it would be very beneficial and not very costly to activate SegWit ASAP.

You can build an optional reversible payment system on top of Bitcoin. One easy way would be to use a script like *(90 days have passed AND recipient signs) OR (chargeback arbiter(s) signs)*, which is possible in Bitcoin today. Within the 90-day chargeback window, the chargeback arbiter would have to approve all transactions, and in case of a long chain of transactions using chargebacked funds, they'd be able to claw back the BTC through the entire chain by requiring that the BTC stay within the chargeback system until at least the end of the chargeback window. At the end of the chargeback window, the recipient could remove the BTC from the chargeback system entirely.
Probably someone could design an even better system with the same security properties but better scaling, and maybe also with better privacy (ie. it's not ideal for the arbiter to always see *every* transaction, when they only *need* to see ones in dispute).
Though I hope that long-term, the problems solved by reversibility will be solved instead by technology: better reputation systems, actually-secure computers and wallets, several layers of loss prevention, etc.

Since people only do the initial sync a handful of times, and it only lasts a relatively short time, I don't view a lack of perfect decentralization in this area as disastrous, even though it's not *good*. Even if centralization here allowed unlimited power over nodes doing the initial sync (which it wouldn't), only very few people would be affected by this until it was noticed and corrected.
In the worst-case scenario where *everyone* forgets how they got to the chain that they're on now, then it'd be necessary to hardcode some block hash as known-valid. Everyone in the community would post this block hash, and anyone newly syncing would have an absolute mountain of evidence pointing to this block hash as being valid. It'd be annoying, but not the end of the world.
But I think that most people would, especially in the presence of good defaults/GUIs, donate at least ~10 GB for this; maybe 2% of especially enthusiastic people would donate hundreds of GB; and a handful would store the entire chain. I would be really surprised if insufficient redundancy ever became a problem. Right now we have tens of thousands of copies of the same 100 GB file. This is a totally unnecessary level of redundancy.

Hey, long time no see.
Using MD5 by default is still pretty lame, and the KDF is still bad (though not *broken*) with SHA-1 instead of MD5. I suppose that OpenSSL is bound to a large degree by the need to maintain backward-compatibility, which could explain some of this.
The zerobin message also claims that due to flaws in the OpenSSL random number generator, you can recover information about the password by looking at the salt. But no evidence is provided, so there's a good chance that this isn't true. If RAND_add/RAND_bytes *are* busted, that'd be really bad for Bitcoin...

It's possible, but it's ridiculous to just draw a line on a chart and conclude that it's going to happen anytime soon. If Bitcoin reached such high prices, that'd either cause or be caused by world-shaking events: BTC would have a market cap greater than the USD M3 money supply, and quite a few BTC early adopters would have wealth comparable to countries.
The easiest way to reach $1 million will be USD hyperinflation. I think that this will happen sometime in the next 50 years, since it seems to me to be the only plausible outcome for the US's addiction to debt. But this says more about the value of USD than BTC.
To reach $1 million in today's value:
1. There could be truly extraordinary growth in demand, probably caused by a worldwide lack of faith in fiat or some other major event.
2. Even in the absence of much growth, if Bitcoin remains the premier cryptocurrency, then I'd expect the value to continuously (but not necessarily quickly) rise in real terms because BTC is highly deflationary.
I think that there's substantial room for growth in demand -- I wouldn't be surprised to see $10k again within a year or two, for example --, but I'm not sure about growth to $1 million in the next couple of decades at least. The fact is that most people are fine with using things like credit cards, bank autopayments, bank-linked payment apps, etc. They're easy enough, and since the payments are reversible, they're highly forgiving of the average person's absolutely abominable security practices. (There are of course many major problems with traditional payments, but the *average person* doesn't care enough.)
In order to reach $1 million levels anytime soon, we'd need at least:
* Hardware infrastructure. Point-of-sale would need the equivalent of credit card terminals, and every person would need secure hardware wallets either on a dedicated device or on their phones. You need to somehow prevent almost all cases of: phishing, malware, wallet bugs, forgotten passwords, mugging someone out of their life savings, etc.
* Some off-chain solution would have to be working perfectly. It's unacceptable for the average person to worry about fees or confirmations.
* There'd have to be significant pull to BTC (merchants passing on lower costs, maybe) and/or significant push from fiat (eg. hyperinflation, widespread privacy concerns, confiscation, etc.).
* Governments can't become too authoritarian. Bitcoin can be made to function even if every country makes it illegal, but that'd make it too difficult for ordinary people to use it. It'd be similar to how most Chinese people don't know how to bypass the Great Firewall, even though it's technically possible.
There are plausible technical solutions for at least the first two points, but we're **nowhere near** achieving them all.
As for value increases due to deflation: I consider it pretty likely that BTC will still be the premier cryptocurrency in 50 years; maybe an 85% probability. If so, that implies in my mind an on-average-increasing value. But even if the price goes up to $100k in 10 years through growth, I'm not sure that deflation alone will be enough to carry us to $1 million in an additional 40 years

No, it's best to think of it like this: whenever a central bank writes a check to buy something, the money is printed from nothing. Whenever a central bank receives money, the money is destroyed.
A small *part* of your tax money will be sent to the ECB and therefore destroyed. However, most EU countries have bonds with negative yields, which means that the EU did something like printing 100 EUR to loan to your country, of which you only have to pay 95 EUR back in total. It's an insanely good deal for your country (from a certain perspective), and the fact that the interest payments are being burned isn't really a major concern.
(BTW, you can see exactly how many bonds of each country the ECB holds [here]( Expand "public sector purchase programme".)
What you *should* be angry about is not some tax money being "burned", but:
* When the ECB prints money (which it does not only via asset purchases, but also through other programs), it makes your EURs worth less. Even if inflation isn't showing up right now in everyday prices, the money *is* floating around in the system.
* When the ECB buys bonds, it enriches people/organizations which already hold bonds. This is primarily banks and rich people.
* After printing a ton of money and giving it to banks and rich people, almost all of this money is used to reinvest in various assets. If you have a billion EUR and the ECB essentially gives you eg. 300 million EUR, then what are you going to do with it except reinvest it? This inflates the price of all assets, which is why charts for many assets tend to go exponential-looking starting in 2009. This is a bubble which will eventually burst. In the meantime, yields on all investments are lowered while also becoming more risky.
Asset buying programs make the rich richer at the expense of the poor and middle class, while making it more difficult for people (especially less wealthy people) to save money going forward.

On one hand:
* There won't be as much money/investment around in general. A lot of people will lose their jobs.
* People with money may want to put it in a cheap stock market rather than BTC. Some people may even want to sell BTC in order to buy stocks.
On the other hand:
* A lot of people in BTC *can't* invest in traditional markets, so flight from BTC to traditional investments may be limited.
* If the recession is caused in part by trade concerns, BTC's lack of barriers may make it look attractive.
* If it's a *huge* recession, confidence in the whole fiat system  may be shaken, which would cause a lot of interest in / drive to BTC. But I suspect that if a recession happens in the next couple of years, it'll be smaller and quicker than 2008, and this kind of faith-shaking will not occur as much.
* BTC has traditionally boomed around the time of a subsidy-halving. This may coincide with the time of a recession, which might counteract the recession's negative effects.
I lean toward thinking that a recession is a bit bearish for BTC, but I'm far from sure.

The entire legacy banking system is massively insecure and built on top of things being reversible. You can often pull money out of someone's account just by knowing some number that is given out all the time (credit card numbers, account numbers, etc.). And both individual accounts as well as entire banks are hacked left and right. But actual theft isn't *too* common because most transfers can be reversed.
It is possible to do an irreversible transfer with the legacy banking system using a wire transfer. Due to overall bank insecurity, these are almost always handled by a human at the bank who will perform additional verification steps.


In the US, payments with credit and debit cards are in fact required by law to be reversible. Not sure about ACH transfers and checks, though it'd be insane for these to *not* be reversible, given the previously-mentioned insecurity of these payment methods.

You bring up several good points.
I think that comparing BTC "market cap" to USD M3 is fair, since they're both trying to vaguely guess at how much money is "out there".
If the market is illiquid, then prices could be pushed up or down beyond reason, but I'd expect liquidity to enter the market in that case and arbitrage this situation. If the price has stayed consistently at $1 million for a while, then I'd guess that the market could bear (and would've borne) pretty substantial BTC dumps; not anywhere near the whole supply, but at a stable $1 million price I bet people could collectively "cash out" billions of USD per month without crashing the market.

Satoshi never used IRC, and he rarely explained his motivations for anything. In this case, he kept the change secret and told people who discovered it to keep it quiet until it was over with so that controversy or attackers wouldn't cause havok with the ongoing rule change.
Luckily, it's really not that important what he thought. This was years ago, so he very well could have changed his mind by now, and he's one man who could be wrong in any case.
I think that he was just trying to solve an obvious denial-of-service attack vector. He wasn't thinking about the future of the network very much except to acknowledge that the limit could be raised if necessary. The network clearly couldn't support larger blocks at that time, and nowadays we know that the software wasn't even capable of handling *1 MB* blocks properly. Satoshi once told me, "I think most P2P networks, and websites for that matter, are vulnerable to an endless number of DoS attacks.  The best we can realistically do is limit the worst cases." I think he viewed the 1 MB limit as just blocking yet another serious DoS attack.
Here's what I [said]( a few months after Satoshi added the limit, which is probably more-or-less how Satoshi and most other experts viewed the future of the limit:






Satoshi is gone now, so it'll be "the developers" who set the larger limit. But it has been determined by the majority of the Bitcoin Core developers (and the majority of Bitcoin experts in general) that the network *cannot* actually safely handle significantly larger blocks, so it won't be done right now. And the economy has the final say, of course, not the developers.
Also see [this post of mine in 2010]( which I think is pretty much exactly how Satoshi reasoned the future would play out, though I now believe it to be very wrong. The main misunderstandings which I and probably Satoshi had are:
* No one anticipated pool mining, so we considered all miners to be full nodes and almost all full nodes to be miners.
* I didn't anticipate ASICs, which cause too much mining centralization.
* SPV is weaker than I thought. In reality, without the vast majority of the economy running full nodes, miners have *every incentive* to collude to break the network's rules in their favor.
* The fee market doesn't actually work as I described and as Satoshi intended for economic reasons that take a few paragraphs to explain.

The point is that you need a randomness-generating tool. Flipping through a book is a tool, though a sub-optimal one. More common words like "the" will be more likely to appear in your passphrase. Also, if you choose a word in the book without dice, you will be more likely to choose words in the middle of the book and the middle of the page, since humans subconsciously interpret "random" as "average"/"center". (And if you intentionally try to avoid doing this, you will be more likely to pick the start or end of the book/page...) This statistical info can theoretically be used by an attacker.
I don't know how secure it'd be to use dice to choose the book, page, line, and word on the line. It sounds like it might be OK, but it might be that certain words would be too statistically likely for this to be secure, even if you avoided using certain very common words. It's *definitely* extremely insecure to choose a phrase from a book, even if you modify it slightly. The fact that it contains some sort of grammatical structure would alone make it much easier to attack.

No, by "implementation detail" I meant that it's not very important to understand in an "ELI9" explanation. It's easier to think of the coins being burned.
The coins are always locked on the Bitcoin side to ensure that bitcoins can never be created outside of mining. Sidechains can have different security properties, so it would be unsafe to just say "any coins burned on the sidechain can be immediately redeemed as new bitcoins", since a security failure on the sidechain would then allow printing unlimited bitcoins. So Bitcoin-&gt;sidechain bitcoins are locked instead of burnt, and sidechain-&gt;Bitcoin transactions redeem specific previously-locked bitcoins.

It doesn't matter when the contentious hardfork happens. The important thing is that XT is intentionally programmed to break the rules without consensus in some case.
Also, even if there was a one-to-one correspondence between miners and users (there's not -- it's entirely possible for 100% of miners but only 10% of average people to use XT), then XT would be programmed to *split* the Bitcoin economy 75-to-25 and then economically try to *force* the minority to accept a rule change that they might not agree with, which is very bad for the ecosystem in every way and totally counter to the ideas behind Bitcoin.

That's probably not allowed. is for the Bitcoin *currency* and things that you can *directly* do with bitcoins. If I can take my bitcoins, deposit them into your site, and then do something interesting without explicitly converting to a different currency, then that might be OK for Bitcoin. For example, a casino could use a Counterparty currency as "chips", and this would be OK for as long as the casino could *automatically* convert deposited BTC into these chips. Similarly, the announcement of the ability to buy something that has real, not-just-speculative value like Overstock shares for BTC would be on-topic regardless of the technology used to handle the Overstock shares, though non-Bitcoin news about Overstock itself or news about the Overstock share price would not be on-topic.

No, Bitcoin is the longest *valid* chain. XT will produce an *invalid* chain and treat it as valid, making it an altcoin.


Simple. Bitcoin nodes will automatically ignore them, since they're producing invalid blocks. In this scenario, people using Bitcoin would only experience slower confirmation times for a few weeks, or until the miners who mined XT came back to Bitcoin.


75% miner agreement is probably evidence that some non-negligible number of people have moved to XT, but it's also possible for 75% of miners to move to XT while only 1% of the nodes and economy have moved to XT. There's no guaranteed relationship between miner adoption and economic adoption. And only economic adoption matters.
Also, many miners might *vote* for XT without actually supporting XT. Then the miners stupid enough to actually use XT will end up mining useless coins outside of the Bitcoin network, and the miners who lied will have less mining competition.

Lighting uses a very similar technique to function, and some of the Lightning software can *experimentally* do cross-chain swaps. There isn't any widely-used/easy-to-use way of doing it yet though, AFAIK. It's most useful in the context of a decentralized exchange, so probably something like Bisq will end up being the first to really adopt it in a major way.

I don't think it'll be a problem in the long run. Only around five XT submissions have been removed in total, over the course of a few days, and some of those were only posted in protest. To compare, I think around three Ethereum submissions were removed in the same time period. XT isn't a massive point of confusion.

Bitcoin full nodes *ignore* invalid chains no matter how long they are. If, for example, all of the major Bitcoin companies and exchanges reject XT, and you use XT, then you will be unable to actually use any coins that are only valid on the XT chain to transact with anyone important. This makes "XT-coins" virtually useless in this scenario, even with a 75% mining majority. Miners are just not that important in this situation. (Exactly how and under what conditions coins would become only valid on the XT chain or the Bitcoin chain but not both is complicated. In practice, what you'll find is that over time your wallet will gradually convert coins valid on both networks to coins valid only on your wallet's network.)

exists to serve Bitcoin. XT will, if/when its hardfork is activated, diverge from Bitcoin and create a separate network/currency. Therefore, it and services that support it should not be allowed on In the extremely unlikely event that the vast majority of the Bitcoin economy switches to XT and there is a strong perception that XT is the true Bitcoin, then the situation will flip and we should allow only submissions related to XT. In that case, the definition of "Bitcoin" will have changed. It doesn't make sense to support two incompatible networks/currencies -- there's only one Bitcoin, and serves only Bitcoin. (Adoption of XT by isn't guaranteed even if it is adopted by the the vast majority of the economy. I wouldn't allow any "Bitcoin" that inflates the currency more quickly, for example, so I'd have to consider whether this hardfork is in this "absolutely prohibited" category before allowing it. But that's not relevant now.)
If a hardfork has near-unanimous agreement from Bitcoin experts and it's also supported by the vast majority of Bitcoin users and companies, we can predict with high accuracy that this new network/currency will take over the economy and become the new definition of Bitcoin. (Miners don't matter in this, and it's not any sort of vote.) This sort of hardfork can probably be adopted on as soon as I've determined that it's not in the "absolutely prohibited" category mentioned above. For right now, there will always be too much controversy around any hardfork that increases the max block size, but this will probably change as there's more debate and research, and as block space actually becomes more scarce. I could see some kind of increase gaining consensus in as soon as 6 months, though it would have to be *much* smaller than the increase in XT for everyone to agree on it so soon.
Even though it might be messy at times, free discussion allows us to most effectively reach toward the truth. That's why I strongly support free speech on and bitcointalk.org. But there's a substantial difference between discussion of a proposed Bitcoin hardfork (which is certainly allowed, and has never been censored here, even though I strongly disagree with many things posted) and promoting software that is programmed to diverge into a competing and worse network/currency. The latter is clearly against the established rules of and while Bitcoin's technology will continue working fine no matter what people do, even the *attempt* at splitting Bitcoin up like this will harm the Bitcoin ecosystem and economy.

It's a good idea, though I think that most people would screw it up by making either a too-weak or too-forgettable passphrase.
The [password utility]( I made 3 years ago does something like that. It asks you a fixed set of questions which should have unforgettable answers and then mixes this into your passphrase and does expensive key stretching. With this particular utility, I think it'd be fairly reasonable to use a purely-random passphrase as short as 6 words or 11 characters, though a little longer might be more comfortably secure. A more fully-fleshed-out tool might allow the user to choose from among many other unforgettable or easy-to-remember questions, estimate the entropy gain of these questions/answers against both targeted and untargeted attacks, and combine+stretch this info in a uniform and somehow forward- and backward-compatible way to produce a final key/seed.

I'm not a Core dev, and I usually don't participate in dev discussions as they happen, but my perception is that Luke and Peter are more perfectionist than average.

Peter is often critical of technical solutions which may be good but sub-optimal, often playing devil's advocate against popular ideas, and he's known for promoting ideas which would provide a ton of advantages, but are especially complex (eg. tree chains).

XT is an altcoin (and is therefore deleted from because it breaks the core consensus rules without consensus, not because it breaks Bitcoin's "currency guarantees". The currency guarantee that everyone knows is the 21 million BTC limit. Maybe there are other guarantees, though that's debatable. XT doesn't break the currency guarantees IMO (though I've heard people make the argument).
Either I don't know what I'm talking there, or I'm talking about something else, because the comment about setting the client-side maturation time to 500 blocks only makes sense if there are often 2+ very long *valid* block chains. This isn't applicable to changes in the core consensus rules, since that produces *invalid* chains.
I admit that there are occasional errors in my old posts, though my spirit stays the same, and I don't remember ever being super embarrassed by an old post of mine.

Yeah, although you can do a native BTC&lt;-&gt;sidechain transaction at the guaranteed rate, it'll probably be most common to use an intermediary because then you don't need to do a slow and relatively expensive on-chain transaction. The fees will be kept very low since the native method is always an option if intermediaries start charging too much. This can be done trustlessly with atomic cross-chain trading.
If USD-&gt;RSK(etc.) becomes common, we'll have to educate people not to leave too much money in the sidechain, since that's only a little better than leaving it in an exchange wallet.

If you win the jackpot on a slot machine, that's a good time to stop: don't throw it all back into the machine. If you make a lot on reckless Bitcoin trades, that's a good time to stop being reckless and consider prudent investing going forward.

Your ISP is a natural man-in-the-middle, so they *can* modify or block your traffic however they want. For example, in many countries ISPs are required to mess with all traffic according to government directives, and in all countries your ISP will act as your adversary if you are directly targeted by the government. You ask whether it might ever be *legal* for US ISPs to do on their own initiative what they already do under government order, and definitely are capable of doing maybe-illegally, but that's a pretty uninteresting corner case...
ISPs can very easily block native Bitcoin P2P traffic. Bitcoin traffic is extremely easy to identify (eg. every Bitcoin message starts with a certain 4-byte magic number), and there is currently no encryption or authentication whatsoever. But except for miners (who really need low latency), Bitcoin is very good at bypassing this kind of thing with the help of separate P2P layers like Tor. In order to be a full node, you need to download the block chain, but this is a chunk of data mirrored in hundreds of thousands of places; you could download the history via radio or sneakernet, and then keep up with it using various obfuscation methods. It's not comparable to BitTorrent, where only a few people have the data that you want. Then to send and receive transactions you only need to move tiny amounts of data, for which there are endless methods of transmission and obfuscation. You could fairly easily send/receive Bitcoin transactions using paper mail if you needed, even. Tor handles the obfuscation well enough for now, but there are even more clever and efficient ways that you could do it if necessary.
Net neutrality is not a free-market concept. It gives governments more regulatory power over the Internet, it restricts people/businesses, and it strongly *promotes* large ISPs that are able to deal with the regulatory and technical costs of the policy. It *is* true that the US ISP industry is given government-granted monopolies in almost all regions, and can therefore be considered almost an arm of the government. So I'm not going to champion against net neutrality or anything. But you shouldn't think of it as anything other than some minor tinkering at the edges. The Internet will not die without net neutrality, and net neutrality will not save the Internet.

If you want growth at any cost, go to ETH or Bcash or whatever. Bitcoin is for stability: a money that will last decades, maybe even centuries, not a plan to take over the world ASAP and make us all fabulously wealthy. Some bigblockers honestly think that in order for Bitcoin to achieve its end objectives, it's necessary for it to spread everywhere ASAP before it can be crushed: if you believe that, then you will find it much easier to adopt or create a different cryptocurrency and *out-compete* Bitcoin, since we Bitcoin true believers will fight you every step of the way if you instead try to hijack Bitcoin. I've seen quite a few bigblockers act as though I'm totally opposed to Bcash, but really I don't mind it; stop trying to hijack *Bitcoin* and I don't care what you do.
A lot of companies showed their true colors here. Some stuck their necks out in the right direction and deserve recognition. And some were clearly working against Bitcoin, to varying degrees. We should make a comprehensive list at some point.

Powell's rhetoric last year was pretty hawkish, but when 99% of people he talks to started screaming at him to prop up the stock market by lowering rates and stopping balance sheet reductions, it seems that he completely caved. This is an illustration of how the Fed can probably never really reform itself. Its easy money is like heroin to basically everyone who touches the fiat economy -- it feels great, but it sure isn't good for you --, and there just isn't enough will to stop it. A central bank can't work perfectly due to the economic calculation problem, but it even fails at doing what it's meant to do because it's run by men, not angels.
If the Fed does another years-long easing cycle, that might delay a recession for a while. I've been thinking that a recession might cause a BTC price slump (because people would have less disposable income, and investors would rush into the stock market), so Fed easing is probably good news for BTC hodlers. Low rates, inflation fears, and a "running on empty" market will push people to high-risk things like BTC, I'd expect.

Most dynamic block size proposals give too much power to miners. If miners can collude to increase max block sizes for free, then there's no reason to believe that they won't make block sizes large enough to contain all fee-paying transactions. There's a proposal called "flex cap" which I like. It makes miners mine at a higher difficultly to vote for larger blocks, introducing some real cost.
No altcoin has enough volume or value to be of much use in this discussion IMO. Their miners are probably still just following the economically irrational but "good citizen" anti-spam policy rules in the default full node software, for example (as Bitcoin miners usually did until recently).

The most important issue is decentralization. Without decentralization, Bitcoin is just the most inefficient transaction system on Earth -- it has very few advantages over other transaction systems in that case.
I don't think that it's at all likely that blocks will get totally full in the next year (and probably not in the next two years), no matter how much of a burst in users there is. The average block size is ~400 kB, so a momentary burst in transactions will only ever cause a delay, which can be fixed by paying a larger fee. We'd only start having more serious problems (where low-value transactions are simply too expensive to ever do) when the average block size got to around 1 MB. If this happens before Lightning or something similar is ready, I'd be OK with an increase to 2 MB. And if 2 MB ends up being insufficient, I might be OK with 3 MB, etc. But increasing the max block size before the network is ready is "spending" decentralization for scalability, so it's not something that should be done willy-nilly when it might not even end up being necessary.

Experts have been warning about the problems with brain wallets (as they are commonly used) for years. A 4-word or 8-character password is fine for a password on a website (though it shouldn't be reused), but brain wallets are different. You have to throw away everything you've been taught about password security because unlike any website or encryption password, everyone in the world will be *constantly* trying to brute-force your brain wallet passphrase *forever*. So your passphrase has to be amazingly strong. Typically what's recommended is 128 bits of entropy (12 **RANDOM** words with Electrum's wordlist, or 10 words with a Diceware wordlist), though you could probably get by with a little less.
Also, it is strongly recommended that you not actually rely 100% on your memory. You might have difficulty imagining this happening to you, but it's very common for people to just suddenly find that they've forgotten a password. Unlike losing a bank password, forgetting a brain wallet passphrase that only exists in your mind will destroy your bitcoins.
You're also not supposed to manually deal with individual Bitcoin keys. It's error-prone and encourages address reuse (which is terrible for privacy and security). People frequently lose bitcoins when handling keys manually due to issues with change or fees. Even Bitcoin experts never handle keys manually when dealing with any significant amount of BTC.
So the proper way to do a "brain wallet" would be to use Electrum's mnemonic feature (and write down the mnemonic somewhere). Or if you really want to do everything yourself for some reason:
* Choose a passphrase that contains around 128 bits of entropy by *randomly* choosing words from a list. The number of entropy bits is `log_2(&lt;number of words in list&gt;^&lt;number of words chosen&gt;)`. Use dice or a computer's cryptographically secure random number generator to choose the words. Humans cannot generate random numbers or words.
* Write down your passphrase and put it in a safe deposit box or something.
* Apply key stretching to the passphrase. I have some proof of concept code for this [here]( but it's not suitable for real-world use. Maybe someone else has better code with more review.
* Give the final key to Electrum or another HD wallet as a custom seed for the HD wallet. Last I checked, you can do this in Electrum by giving it the hexadecimal key/seed when it asks for your mnemonic seed. Electrum will then be able to generate an infinite number of Bitcoin keys from your generated seed, and you won't have to deal with keys manually.

First, entropy in computer science is **totally different** from entropy in physics. It's sorta-kinda the same general idea, which is why computer scientists named it like that, but if you're thinking about the second law of thermodynamics or whatever in relation to passwords, you're just going to get confused.
In cryptography, entropy is a measure of *true randomness*. An n-bit number chosen uniformly at random with a perfect random number generator has n bits of entropy, and entropy of other things can be computed in comparison to this case. For example, 4 words chosen uniformly at random from a wordlist of 1024 words has 40 bits of entropy because you can represent each word by 10 bits (2^10 = 1024) and stick the 4 groups of 10 bits together to get a 40-bit number chosen uniformly at random. When dealing with things chosen uniformly at random, you can also compute the entropy by calculating the base-2 logarithm of the total possible outcomes, eg. there are 6^20 possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die 20 times and then writing down the results one after another (ie. not summing or reordering them), so the result has log_2(6\^20) ~= 51.7 bits of entropy. If the result is in any way biased (like the *sum* of dice rolls, which is very much not uniformly distributed), then you can still calculate the entropy, but it's more difficult.
In more practical terms, a password or key with higher entropy is harder to guess because there are more possibilities that an attacker has to go through. In passwords, you typically increase entropy by increasing the length, complexity, randomness, and/or diversity of characters; **however**, entropy relates to how to the password was *generated*, not just how long it is. If you copy a paragraph off of Wikipedia and give it to a "password entropy analyzer", it'll probably give you a high score, but in reality the amount of entropy will be quite low because your password is biased: it's composed of English words rather than random characters, it's a real English sentence rather than random words, and it exists in a document somewhere rather than being chosen randomly. A dumb calculator can't actually know the entropy of a password: to truly calculate the entropy requires analysis of *how the password was generated*.

The main incentive is increased security. If you use a lightweight wallet then you might be tricked into accepting transactions that later become invalid. You can avoid this by using Bitcoin Core as a wallet or by connecting a lightweight wallet to your personal full node.


That's fine.
If you want to use a full node for increased security, then even dial-up is theoretically sufficient, though you'll have to adjust some settings. Don't worry about hurting the network in this case -- your drain is very small. If you want to contribute to the network's capacity, then you'll want around 2 Mbit/s upload capacity and you should try to keep Bitcoin Core running most of the time. (But there's no need to be paranoid about uptime.)

When Electrum 2 generates a seed, it continuously generates random seeds until it finds one that has a hash that starts with the version/checksum byte (currently 0x01), making 255 out of every 256 seeds impossible. This reduces entropy by 8 bits, since any attacker can also eliminate 255/256 seeds. Electrum requires 128 bits of entropy, so it creates 13-word mnemonics because `log_2(2048^13) - 8 = 135 &gt;= 128`, but `log_2(2048^12) - 8 = 124 &lt; 128`. Electrum 1 had no checksum, so it was able to generate 12-word mnemonics to get 128 bits of entropy.

The second time was done using a backdoor that had been planted during the first hack and not found during the post-first-hack security review (which was, incidentally, performed mostly by Mark Karpelès).

I don't think that a technical solution is yet known, though it's possible that one exists. I guess the current idea is to just keep changing the PoW algorithm every few years until manufacturers learn not to self-mine. It's not a great solution, but better than allowing mining to become totally centralized.
It's impossible to create an ASIC-proof algorithm. It might be possible to create an algorithm where the most efficient "ASIC" is one that people already own (ie. CPUs/GPUs). On the other hand, there are only two decent CPU manufacturers, and they can both create CPUs far cheaper than what they sell them for, so maybe trying to force CPU mining would actually be bad for decentralization in the long run. It's a difficult problem that requires a lot more thought/research.
Maybe adding a little proof-of-stake to PoW would help a bit. There's a proposal called Proof of Activity that I like in general, though AFAIK it's not popular with most experts.
Another avenue is to reduce the reliance on miners by adding fraud proofs to the protocol so that even users of lightweight clients can't be tricked by evil miners into accepting invalid blocks/transactions. Then we don't need to worry about attacks by miners so much. Miners could still do double-spending attacks, though - that can't be eliminated.

No, XT will wait for miners to accept it. Miner adoption is unrelated to economic adoption. Also, even if mining adoption was one-to-one correlated with economic adoption, 75% is insufficient.

7 peers: Every node has at least 8 peers (sometimes 100+ more), but one of them will be the one sending you the block, so you don't need to rebroadcast to them.


It's a very rough estimate.


Unknown, but 8 MB blocks seem like way too much bandwidth for the network to handle.




Blocks are very rarely actually 1 MB in size. It's more of an issue if it's happening continuously. It might be the case that problems *would* occur if blocks were always 1 MB in size. Though it's not like one minute Bitcoin is working fine and the next minute it's dead: stability would gradually worsen as the average(?) block size increased. 
Probably the network wouldn't actually tolerate this, and centralization would be used to avoid it. For example, at the extreme end, if blocks were always 1 GB (which almost no one can support), probably the few full nodes left in existence would form "peering agreements" with each other, and you'd have to negotiate with an existing full node to become a full node. Though this sort of centralization can also destroy Bitcoin because if not enough of the economy is backed by full nodes, miners are strongly incentivized to break the rules for their benefit but at the expensive of everyone else, since no one can prevent it.

Gold was used as a medium of exchange for thousands of years, and people didn't all drop dead.
Bitcoin is even more deflationary than gold, though, long-term. It'll be an interesting experiment. Mainstream economists would probably unanimously predict that it'd lead to a deflationary spiral or other catastrophe, but Bitcoin was created in part due to skepticism of mainstream economics. If Bitcoin takes over the world, this'll not only provide people with a much better currency than anything before, but it'd discredit a lot of popular economics.
Keep in mind that although Bitcoin is intentionally *very* deflationary, it's not possible for a decentralized cryptocurrency to behave like a central bank, since decentralized cryptocurrencies cannot know their own prices. You have to encode the monetary inflation at the start of the currency, and if the currency doesn't have some insanely *high* monetary inflation rate, then at least some periods of deflation are unavoidable.

This version is programmed to hardfork even though there is no consensus among the community/economy/experts to hardfork, so it is an altcoin, not Bitcoin. is for Bitcoin-related posts only. Therefore, I have removed this post, and I will continue to remove future submissions that are strongly associated with XT versions containing the max block size increase. (Not all submissions mentioning XT are disallowed. When considering whether a submission would be OK, replace "Bitcoin XT" with "Litecoin" in your mind.)
exists to serve Bitcoin. XT will, if/when its hardfork is activated, diverge from Bitcoin and create a separate network/currency. Therefore, it and services that support it should not be allowed on In the extremely unlikely event that the vast majority of the Bitcoin economy switches to XT and there is a strong perception that XT is the true Bitcoin, then the situation will flip and we should allow only submissions related to XT. In that case, the definition of "Bitcoin" will have changed. It doesn't make sense to support two incompatible networks/currencies -- there's only one Bitcoin, and serves only Bitcoin. (Adoption of XT by isn't guaranteed even if it is adopted by the the vast majority of the economy. I wouldn't allow any "Bitcoin" that inflates the currency more quickly, for example, so I'd have to consider whether this hardfork is in this "absolutely prohibited" category before allowing it. But that's not relevant now.)
If a hardfork has near-unanimous agreement from Bitcoin experts and it's also supported by the vast majority of Bitcoin users and companies, we can predict with high accuracy that this new network/currency will take over the economy and become the new definition of Bitcoin. (Miners don't matter in this, and it's not any sort of vote.) This sort of hardfork can probably be adopted on as soon as I've determined that it's not in the "absolutely prohibited" category mentioned above. For now, there will always be too much controversy around any hardfork that increases the max block size, but this will probably change as there's more debate and research, and as block space actually becomes more scarce. I could see some kind of increase gaining consensus in as soon as 6 months, though it would have to be *much* smaller than the increase in XT for everyone to agree on it so soon.

There are several issues. Look through the mailing list and my past posts for more details. One obvious and easy-to-understand issue is that in order to be a constructive network node, you need to *quickly* upload new blocks to many of your 8+ peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity. Since most people can't do this, the network (as it is currently designed) would fall apart from lack of upstream capacity: there wouldn't be enough total upload capacity for everyone to be able to download blocks in time, and the network would often go "out of sync" (causing stales and temporary splits in the global chain state). This problem could be fixed by having nodes download most of a block's transactions before the block is actually created, but this technology doesn't exist yet, and there's ongoing debate on how this could be done (there are some proposals out there for this which you may have heard of, but they aren't universally accepted).
There are several other major problems. Many of them can be partially fixed with additional technology, but in the absence of this technology it is imprudent to raise the limit now. If all fixable problems were fixed (probably not something that can be done in less than a couple years unless someone hires several new full-time expert Bitcoin devs to work on it), I think 8 MB would be somewhat OK, though higher than ideal, and then the max block size could grow with global upload bandwidth.

People who say that are lying or misinformed. Lightning would still be useful with BIP 101 because it allows instant transfers and microtransactions. (Even with 8 MB blocks, there wouldn't be enough room for extremely small transactions. Also, there's a small cost for miners to add new transactions to blocks, and you might want to send amounts smaller than that cost.)
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:58:31
If miners could be trusted to keep blocks reasonably small, then it wouldn't be such a big deal. The hard max block size could be removed in that case. In fact, if miners could be entirely trusted, then we could remove almost all of Bitcoin's rules. The hard max block size *guarantees* that people who can support that block size consistently can be full nodes. 1 MB guarantees that most typical people can run a full node at home. I suppose 8 MB guarantees that at least large businesses can run full nodes. Removing the max block size (or making it ridiculously high) guarantees nothing.
Moreover, excess supply tends to breed more demand. If there were several megabytes of unused block capacity, I'd expect people to start using it as a convenient way to store large chunks of arbitrary data. Also, keep spam attacks in mind, which have been able to consistently fill 1 MB and could just as easily fill 8 MB. (Ideally miners should filter out spam, but they often don't.)


No, I don't. They are more-or-less anonymous people with very different incentives from myself. And Bitcoin doesn't generally require trusting miners much.


No. I don't have any particular interest in Lightning (or Blockstream). I'm not even very up-to-speed on its technical details. When I talk about "Lightning", I'm actually thinking of the general idea of doing many transactions off-chain with the help of "caching servers". Lightning is just the most popular proposal for doing this at the moment. This is an idea far older than Lightning (and before Lightning it was already implemented partially in StrawPay, for example).


We're not presently faced with this choice.


I suppose that some people are angry because they despise moderation in general, and some people are angry because they think that I'm unfairly trying to influence the debate using censorship rather than technical arguments. In fact, I previously allowed any blocksize proposal on (and this will continue in the future when things have calmed down), and I am personally fine with many of them. I could live with any proposal that doesn't increase block sizes beyond around 3 MB this year and then ~30% per year after that. I also think that removing the global max block size would be workable (though probably sub-optimal) [if done properly](
But trying to hijack Bitcoin using something like XT is not an acceptable/good way forward. It is very damaging to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and the only consistent moderation position AFAICT is to consider it to be an altcoin. I would treat anything XT-like the same way, no matter what hardfork change it contained. The change *in* XT is fair game, but XT *itself* is not.

This is technically inaccurate (if 100% of miners started making too-large blocks, almost the entire Bitcoin economy would automatically ignore them), not what Satoshi intended (he implied several times that your Bitcoin full node should follow the rules "no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what", and he frequently changed the rules of full nodes with no regard for what miners did), and a very bad idea for how to govern anything (why would anyone expect a small handful of anonymous people who were able to buy some mining hardware to behave honestly/correctly when they often have incentives *not* to do so?).
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:45:13


Not really. Bitcoin is only ruined months or even years after miners create too-large blocks. One 8 MB block isn't going to kill Bitcoin overnight and make all of its miner's bitcoins worthless. It's the general trend of too-large blocks which will gradually push out too many full nodes and make Bitcoin too centralized to be especially useful.
On the other hand, miners have an immediate incentive to include as many fee-paying transactions as possible, since they get the fees.


I'm never going to support an ongoing attempt to "hardfork" without consensus, since that'd split Bitcoin. *Maybe* there are cases where consensus can be reached without the Bitcoin Core developers, though we're *nowhere near* that point.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:54:58


No, they're two different things. There are a few different ways of moving BTC to/from a sidechain:
* The native way is to create a special on-chain transaction which locks up the BTC until withdrawal. Depending on the design of the sidechain, you might have to wait a long time (over a hundred confirmations in Blockstream's original sidechain paper, probably less for federated sidechains like RSK) and this transaction might be extra large.
* Atomic cross-chain trading can be used in the same way as on altcoins for a faster, smaller transaction.
* Lightning can be used cross-chain for instant, off-chain, trustless transactions. (None of the existing LN daemons actually support cross-chain channels yet AFAIK, but it is described in the LN paper.)

Probably true in the long run, but the hard forks will need to have consensus and be done properly or Bitcoin will die due to the economy being constantly shattered into several pieces, or as a side-effect of forcing through technically unsound changes that the majority of experts disagree with (like XT's 8MB block size).
@_date: 2015-08-10 06:22:43
Sidechains and Lightning can be done with a softfork, which does not require nearly the same level of agreement as a hardfork. Even if a hardfork was required, Sidechains and Lightning are very closely-related to Bitcoin, so discussion of their technology would be appropriate here, just as discussion of the max block size is appropriate here. If someone created an altcoin based on Bitcoin (like XT) which used a hardfork to support sidechains or Lightning (even though a hardfork is unnecessary), that wouldn't be allowed unless it received consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:14:10
Not always. What you'd want to do is obtain some xt-coins and send a transaction to yourself with inputs containing all of your bitcoins plus the xt-coins. This would only be confirmed on the XT side. Then do the same on the Bitcoin side with post-fork BTC. Then you'll have an equal amount of xt-coins and post-fork BTC that won't be further mixed.

Note: altcoins like XT are off-topic on and you're mostly talking about XT, so this is deleted.
Bitcoin has a set of unbreakable rules. These include the 21 million BTC limit, but also a limit on the maximum size of blocks. These rules can't be broken even if all miners agreed. They can only be changed in a hardfork, which is where a new currency (and network) is created based on Bitcoin (with all of the same address balances, etc.), and essentially everyone agrees to move to this currency and call it "Bitcoin". Most experts believe that the Bitcoin network is *currently* not ready to handle blocks above the current 1 MB limit, but a few disagree and are trying to do a "hardfork" without having everyone agree. Since there isn't widespread agreement on this change, this attempt is really the same as creating an altcoin with the same address balances as Bitcoin and trying to trick people into moving to it and calling it Bitcoin. It sounds like it might work OK if you get the majority of people to switch to it, but in reality this altcoin can't really be called Bitcoin, and the attempt will tear Bitcoin apart if it has any success because some people will stay with Bitcoin and some people will move to XT. Imagine if one day half of all stores stopped accepting dollars and only accepted some new Dollar XT currency -- the market value and usefulness of both currencies would go way down compared to the original Dollar value/usefulness, and it'd be amazingly bad for everyone.

My understanding (not an expert):


Yes. Your cost basis is the cost of mining them.


When you sell them or buy something with them, that's when capital gains/losses take effect.


No. Every exchange trade needs to be taken into account. Usually they'll provide the trade data in a form that you can import into a spreadsheet. I wrote a simple program to take spreadsheet trades and do the actual cost-basis calculations (it's way too tedious to do by hand), but I don't want to publish it in case it's wrong... Maybe there's something similar on the Web somewhere, or maybe you could write something. For simplicity you could stick to FIFO/LIFO if you want, but it's also OK to arbitrarily decide which bitcoins are actually being sold, since bitcoins are fungible like stock shares. Though if you sell a batch of bitcoins, make sure you mark this in your spreadsheet so that you don't sell it again in the future.
Basically, anything you do with bitcoins other than sending them to yourself needs to be added to a spreadsheet and used in your capital gains calculation.

Those are all separate tax amounts. You add them up.

No. BIP 101 is an example of a proposed hardfork of Bitcoin, and is allowed on XT is an altcoin, and is off-topic on &gt; Every reasonable person working on it and supporting it considers it a hard fork of Bitcoin.
Maybe, but they don't behave as if it's a hard fork. In a hard fork, you get ~everyone to upgrade before it is activated. Successful hard forks are not controversial. But XT is intentionally designed to fork the network/currency *before* everyone has accepted the chain, splitting Bitcoin. The goal of XT is to force and win an economic war between the XT and Bitcoin currencies. That's not a prudent way to move Bitcoin forward, and it can't be called a Bitcoin hard fork.


As I've explained several times previously, in that extremely unlikely case the definition of Bitcoin will probably have changed such that XT is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core is not. There is only one Bitcoin network/currency, and supports only Bitcoin, so if the definition changes in that way, only the XT currency/network would be allowed on For the definition to change from the status quo, both of these must be true:
* 99.9% of the Bitcoin *economy* actively engages in the redefinition (ie. they actually exist only on the new network/currency). Verbal support is insufficient. Miners and nodes are irrelevant. Individual users have much less weight than big companies with more economic weight.
* The new currency must not break Bitcoin's absolute core principles. For example, it cannot create more bitcoins than are allowed. I currently believe that 8 MB blocks do not violate Bitcoin's absolute core principles.
Legitimate hard forks happen when it's believed with very high certainty that the above conditions *will* exist when the hard fork is activated, and the hard fork deployment is done in a way that ensures this by using long time delays (not any sort of miner voting, which is irrelevant). See [here]( where I explain how you might try to do an 8 MB hard fork legitimately.

No, classifying XT as an altcoin (or just "not Bitcoin", if you prefer) is the only reasonable and consistent position. Otherwise people could very easily create more "traditional" altcoins in the same way as XT and demand that they be allowed on &gt; XT is already gaining a lot of support, and there is a very real possibility that this will be the future of Bitcoin. 
You believe this because you get most of your info from which has been heavily manipulated by pro-huge-blocks people. The actual chance of XT defeating Bitcoin is nearly zero.


Good. Controversial "hardforks" should not exist, much less go smoothly.


I've posted about 60 comments about this in 2 days (many quite detailed and lengthy), and many more about this issue in general over the last few months. I've been nothing if not open. And I have certainly not quashed any discussion about the future of Bitcoin itself.


If no one has significant technical objections, I think it'll be easy. The Core devs will put it in Bitcoin Core scheduled to activate after a year or so, no one of any economic significance will care to complain (because I'm assuming that no one has significant technical objections), everyone will just naturally upgrade without any extra effort, and that'll be that.


Good. If consensus can never be reached, then the hardfork should never occur. Just because *you* want something doesn't mean that it's ever reasonable for you to hijack Bitcoin from the people who don't want it, even if your side is the majority (which it isn't currently). This isn't some democratic country where you can always get your way with sufficient politicking. Get consensus, live without the change, or create your own altcoin.


No one supports 1 MB forever. It might be somewhat inconvenient if consensus on some sort of reasonable short-term increase schedule can't gain consensus by 2017 or so.
There are other, non-blocksize hardforks that I do support. Bitcoin can't stay the same forever. I will hold these hardforks to the same consensus criteria, but these proposals have more merit and less risk, so I expect them to be easier.

What do you mean by "proposes"?
If someone involved in Bitcoin Core proposes a hard fork, then that's something substantial and new so probably the first announcement would be allowed under the temporary rules. Further submissions would not be allowed under the temporary rules. Once the temporary rules are done, any discussion about any hard fork will be allowed, though not discussion of software which implements a hard fork without consensus, since that software will be altcoin software, not Bitcoin software.
If by "proposes" you mean that Bitcoin Core adds hardfork code *right now*, when there's no consensus, then this would mean that Bitcoin Core would be altcoin software starting from that version, and would not be allowed. I doubt they'd add hard fork code without consensus, though.

Yes, the max block size will have to be increased at some point if Bitcoin gets to that point. Hopefully by then the software, hardware, and Internet will have improved enough to support larger blocks comfortably.
Some experts think that the max block size should more-or-less be as small as possible, and I think that that's a survivable situation, but I'd prefer it to be as *large* as it can be without hurting decentralization. So if the world's CPU speed, upload speed, and disk space increases enough in one year to allow a 10% increase in max block size without any increased "real average load", then I believe that the max block size should increase by 10% that year. I don't consider fee markets to be a big problem -- I think assurance contracts would be sufficient --, so I'm not interested in artificially restricting the size of blocks far below what the network can actually handle. I'm only worried about decentralization.
This stuff is kind of tangential to the point of this thread, though. Even if my ideal block size proposal was in XT instead of the 8 MB increase, I still wouldn't support it or allow it on because it doesn't have expert consensus (my proposal might be wrong if most experts explicitly reject it), and more importantly it is not Bitcoin and would break apart the Bitcoin network/currency if actually adopted.

Many of them have been expressing the same concerns about the max block size for years, so it's unlikely that any recent possible conflict of interest is influencing them. Also, if they believed that increasing the max block size would help Bitcoin as a whole, what reason would they have to prevent this? I don't see the incentive.
We don't need to trust this list of people, of course. But I for one have found the conservative position's arguments to be much more convincing than the huge-increase position's arguments.

Derivatives are a stabilizing force in general, and can be very useful even to ordinary people as a sort of insurance. For example, a business could theoretically deal entirely in BTC but with significantly less risk by buying derivative contracts covering their BTC. The main issue is that there are currently only two flavors of derivative exchange: regulated to hell and back, and ultra shady. So I'm not sure how useful it'll actually be in the near future.
Funds based on derivatives are like a bunch of people getting together and *betting* on the BTC price without actually buying/selling any BTC. They're therefore somewhat separate from the real market, though they still affect each other.

Here's the thread:
Quickseller doesn't seem completely unreasonable here.
Forum admins never "work outside of the system" by directly adjusting the trust network or non-spam trust ratings, and we only modify the base DefaultTrust list (which Quickseller is *not* on) very rarely. The only way that I could single-handedly remove this rating (for people using DefaultTrust) in a way consistent with forum policy would be to remove BadBear or Tomatocage from the base DefaultTrust list, which I'm not going to do since these are extremely trustworthy forum members.
There are various ways to remove your negative trust score:
* Quickseller is in the default trust network via BadBear and Tomatocage. You could convince them both to remove Quickseller. This would remove Quickseller from the default trust network.
* You could convince two other members of the default trust list to explicitly exclude Quickseller. (Or convince one person to explicitly exclude and convince one of BadBear or Tomatocage to remove, or convince one of BadBear or Tomatocage to turn their trust into an exclusion.) This would remove Quickseller from the default trust network.
* You could convince one person in the default trust network to give you positive trust. This'd change your trust from a negative value to the special value ???. For example, maybe xetsr would be willing to do this since he gave DjVoodo negative trust.
* You could give Quickseller (who is in fact usually correct in his investigations) the info that he wants.
* You could create a custom trust list for yourself. Then you wouldn't see your trust score as negative. Trust ratings/scores are not viewable to people who aren't logged into the forum, and many people do define a custom trust list, so the only people who would see your negative trust would be newbies who haven't created their own trust lists and people who actually trust (maybe indirectly) QuickSeller.

A sidechain is like an altcoin where there is a protocol rule in both Bitcoin and the "altcoin" that guarantees that you can always get 1 bitcoin by burning 1 sidechain-coin, you can always get 1 sidechain-coin by burning 1 bitcoin, and there are no other ways of creating new sidechain-coins.

That was a soft fork, not a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:36:35


"Entire" = When the hard fork happens, the side that is still on the old network/currency is economically insignificant. For example, if you expect that XT will fork when there's a 75-25 economic split between XT and Bitcoin (this is definitely not guaranteed by its miner-based trigger), then you'd expect the market price of both currencies to go down significantly because a big chunk of both sides' economies will have been lost. In a legitimate hard fork in which the "entire" economy moves to a new currency, there would be no noticeable price drop because the economy would still be intact.


Only via violence or threat of violence.


Right, "consensus" is always subjective. Collectivists tend to use the word "consensus" to mean "I guess everyone will all sort of agree or something? Let's just forget about that." And then in reality consensus is defined by some sort of secretariat who has all of the power. I am defining "consensus" in a much more exact way, though it is still somewhat subjective. A hard fork has consensus in Bitcoin if there is no economically significant opposition to it, or if this can be expected with high certainly to occur by the time the hard fork is activated.
Someone always has to *interpret* consensus. In the case of moderation, that is me. With Bitcoin as a whole, each person will need to individually interpret consensus. Here's an example of how I view how this would work:  was considering restricting the alert system to a series of codes, so the developers could only activate certain predefined messages. Here's the message I [proposed]( (with edits from others) for the CONSENSUS_FLUX alert code:


(The intended usage of that message would be cases where Bitcoin is imminently failing and a hardfork is necessary to fix things. It wouldn't be used for more gradual hardforks.)

I wouldn't support a contentious hardfork, of course. (Though miners don't really matter here. Miners are employees of the network, and the network can fire them at any time. Obviously miners would oppose any PoW change.) I think that it would be fairly easy to get consensus for a PoW-changing hardfork if mining actually did become centralized to 2-3 entities. Probably easier than the max block size issue.

USDT is IMO probably monopoly money not actually backed by USD. If you think that USDT is backed by USD, then you're assuming:
1. Tether actually has the $600 million that they claim.
2. There are enough stupid people who were willing to send that USD to Tether even though Tether's legal terms don't require them to hold this money in reserve. Anyone who sends them USD is basically throwing it into a black hole as far as the legal terms are concerned.
3. There are enough people who are *able* to send that USD to Tether even though Tether's bank accounts were apparently all shut down.
4. Even if Tether actually was sent $600 million, you're assuming that they're actually keeping it in reserve even though their legal terms don't require it.
It's totally unbelievable to me, so I don't believe it.
Now, with that in mind, some speculate that USDT monopoly money is being printed out of thin air and then used to pump the BTC price. But I'm not so convinced about this second part, since only a few exchanges (Bitfinex and a handful of more minor ones) use/support USDT. If I had a trillion freshly-printed USDT, I could buy BTC until I wipe out the Bitfinex order book, but the people who sold me BTC couldn't take their money to GDAX or BitStamp or whatever because it's not real USD. Maybe these other exchanges would be somewhat affected just by seeing the ticker price increase on Bitfinex, but since real arbitrage wouldn't be possible, I think that the damage would be limited. So if USDT is ever finally *proven* to have fake reserves, such as in a bank run scenario, I'd expect some drop in BTC price, maybe 15-20%, but not an absolute disaster.
BTW, the current situation strikes me as the kind of thing that a scam would do in response to a bank run. This is just wild speculation, but I can't help but imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Tether gets too many withdrawal requests, and they don't have the necessary money. So they themselves send this USDT and make this announcement as a delaying tactic. Now they have an excuse not to allow withdrawals.

The fee market doesn't work for incentivizing mining in general. The problem is that if there are even just a few stupid or generous miners who accept transactions at a loss, then miners as a group lose their ability to enforce reasonable pricing. If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security.
However, I think that assurance contracts will work to create sufficient mining incentive = security, so this isn't something I worry about too much.

If block sizes actually reach 8 MB regularly, then you'd need around 15 Mbit/s *upload* to be a constructive full node instead of a "leech". If there are too many leeches relative to non-leeches, then the Bitcoin network will fall apart: a bit like a BitTorrent swarm that's downloading a constantly-growing file but has way more leeches than seeds.
Additionally, due to increased bandwidth, CPU, and disk space demands, many people would have to stop running a full node entirely. But if not enough of the economy runs full nodes, then Bitcoin has no security whatsoever because miners will be able to (and will be incentivized to) break the rules to their own benefit, and no one with any economic significance will be able to stop them.

I no longer agree with this, for reasons which I have explained in detail everywhere. (At least in the naïve "just set the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant to the protocol max" method of having no max blocksize. There might be some way to have no *global* max if miners were still restricted to some effective max which allowed enough people to run full nodes, but that'd require some extra work, and it'd probably still be sub-optimal in many ways compared to a global max.) 
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:28:03


No, the soft fork reassigns one of the OP_NOP opcodes reserved for softforks to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY. So old nodes will do less verification than new nodes (treating CLTV as a no-op), and therefore CLTV-enabled nodes will only ever reject previously-valid transactions, not allow previously-invalid transactions.


If someone linked to that branch and encouraged people to start running it, then that'd be "altcoin talk" that wouldn't belong on You could link to the same branch calling it proof of concept code and it'd be OK, unless you were clearly only calling it a proof of concept in order to get around rules.
We're not robots or lawyers here. In almost all cases, anyone can tell the difference between a post that is talking about proof of concept code and a post that is advocating a "hostile hardfork" / altcoin. In hypothetical edge cases, a mod would just have to make a case-specific judgement call. Sometimes you need exactness, but not in moderation policies.

I don't think that's a very good list of experts in general, though, since many experts (like Mike Hearn) don't contribute much to Core. And that's not even a very accurate way of measuring "who contributed most to Core".
I think expert flair is pretty reasonable. I introduced a set of initial experts that everyone can agree about (from both sides of this current debate), and then any of them can add more experts who meet the criteria. Mostly to prevent any expert from trying to "pad the ranks" for political reasons, I reserve the right to reject invitations, but I've never actually done this.

"Vote" is a somewhat misleading word... If you set up a million nodes on VPSes somewhere (even all on different IPs), and they all support 50 MB blocks or whatever, then this would have no effect on the network. It's really an economic thing: if the vast majority of the *economy* is backed by nodes on one side of a hardfork, then that side will "win". So you only get a "vote" if you use a full node for your actual everyday transactions.

By independent I mean that it's not committed to following Bitcoin Core, or the Bitcoin Foundation, or any other group. I guess you want it to be *neutral*, which bitcoin.org does strive to be within the Bitcoin ecosystem, but not among differing currencies (which a hardfork creates). Rather, Bitcoin.org has a responsibility to figure out which "Bitcoin" is the true Bitcoin, and then to stick with that one currency. As I mentioned in the pull request for that blog post about this, it's possible that XT might become the new "Bitcoin" in the future and therefore be supported by bitcoin.org, but because there is no consensus among the economy/community/experts, this new definition is not guaranteed to actually occur, so bitcoin.org can for now only consider "Bitcoin" to not include hardforking-XT.
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:56:19
Note: altcoins are off-topic on so this is deleted.


Like most altcoins, XT is a *software fork* of Bitcoin Core. XT is not some sort of new version/incarnation of Bitcoin: it is compatible with Bitcoin for the moment in order to more easily sucker fools into using it, but it is programmed to become a separate network/currency in the future.


Miners don't matter. What matters is what the economy does. It's possible for 75% of miners to switch to XT while essentially none of the economy does so.
If there's a 75-25 split in the *economy*, then the usefulness and market value of both the Bitcoin and XT currencies will drop significantly. What would happen if some big chunk of stores stopped accepting dollars?


Your bitcoins will remain *technically* safe, but they might become worth substantially less if XT tears the Bitcoin economy apart. Also, if you use XT to transact after it diverges from Bitcoin, then its wallet software will tend to convert your bitcoins into xt-coins incompatible with Bitcoin.
It's probably a good idea to not touch old coins after XT diverges if you think that XT has any chance of successfully hijacking Bitcoin.


No. XT creates a separate currency/network. You need to choose between sticking with Bitcoin and moving to a different currency which contains changes which most experts believe make it far inferior to Bitcoin. Running XT is not a "vote" for bigger blocks: it is agreeing to a "suicide pact" to sell Bitcoin, buy an altcoin, and start calling this altcoin Bitcoin at some point in the future.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:36:42


That'd be too soon. Maybe after 30 blocks. But yeah, moving a transaction from "unconfirmed" to "expired - try again" might be good.


Bitcoin Core already won't allow you to send a transaction with a fee that it considers too low to ever confirm.
Working in terms of real time instead of blocks might be an improvement, but this stuff is pretty unreliable in general.


Guarantees aren't possible. You can't *force* nodes to remember transactions forever and, indeed, transaction flood attacks might force them to forget transactions. Also, individual nodes might remember transactions forever, but nodes that were offline when that transaction was broadcast won't have it, so over time the network will still slowly forget it. (You might correct this by having nodes share these transactions amongst each other, but then you're opening a big can of worms by trying to set up another decentralized database.)
The current way is far more elegant.


Low-fee transactions are rate-limited, and nodes won't relay transactions that they already know about, so that wouldn't work as well as you'd hope. But if it made it difficult for people to resend low-fee transactions, probably we'd see a widespread rollout of FSS-RBF.
In the future, Lightning (or similar) will improve this a lot because people will mainly be dealing with a particular always-online Lightning server (of their choice) which will handle all of this. The base Bitcoin protocol is not so great for end-users, as you've noticed, but higher-level protocols built on Bitcoin can do better.

In practice I'd expect most users to initially choose some random number, find themselves on an abandoned separate network, and then search the Web to find the "correct" value. To the extent that people find or choose different max block size values, the network *will* split into several entirely independent pieces, which is very bad for Bitcoin. The more people who use a money, the more valuable and useful that money is. If you expect that the economy can almost entirely agree on one particular value, then why not just hard fork to this value to avoid user confusion? Since you assume economic consensus, the prerequisite for a legitimate hardfork is already met.
If you wanted to do something like this, I think it'd make a lot more sense for the software to measure its CPU/disk/network capacity and accept, reject, or discourage blocks based on this, without giving the user an explicit choice (except maybe as a command-line option that isn't supposed to typically be used). So if the software determines that it's in a situation where it can only comfortably handle 2 MB blocks, then it should discourage (ie. delay relaying) blocks that approach this limit and reject them after that limit. And if it appears that someone ends up on an absolutely abandoned network/currency (based on invalid chain lengths), the software should advise the user to switch to lightweight mode if he's on hardware/Internet that he considers "weak", or continue protesting on this separate network if his hardware *should* be supported but isn't.
I guess the above might be workable, though it'd be likely to cause much more "turbulence" than agreeing on a single global limit. Also, maybe it gives miners too much power, and there might be other problems.


I don't really know what you're talking about here.

In a legitimate hardfork, a new network/currency is created and the entire (for all practical purposes) Bitcoin economy agrees to redefine "Bitcoin" as this new network/currency.
XT is intentionally programmed to create and move to a new network/currency even when a large portion of the Bitcoin economy (potentially even the vast majority) will refuse to consider this new currency to be Bitcoin. Therefore, XT is not Bitcoin, but rather an altcoin.
Let's say I created a fork of Bitcoin Core that was exactly the same except that it allowed me to create endless amounts of bitcoins whenever I wanted. Is that still Bitcoin? It has the same genesis block, and everyone keeps their old bitcoins. What if I promise to pay miners tons of my new bitcoins if they agree to mine using my software, and I got 90% of miners to mine for me? What if I have a signed message from Satoshi saying that my software is the true Bitcoin? What if Bitcoin is currently undergoing serious deflation-induced problems as some economists predict, and some famous/smart/notable people believe that giving control to an expert central banker like myself (/s) would be good? No. The only way you could make a reasonable case for this new currency being "the real Bitcoin" would be if the vast majority of the *Bitcoin economy* adopted it for some reason. XT is extremely similar to this example except that the change it contains is a bit less controversial.


No one elected me. This isn't a democracy. You are neither my constituency nor my customer. You can use and other sites I'm associated with and deal with me and my policies, or not. That's your choice.

I choose to create and enforce policies that I know with some certainty to be correct even when they are vastly unpopular because I believe that any other method of operation is nonsensical.

Anarcho-capitaism relates to governments. I believe that a government is unnecessary. Instead, people can be adequately served in all areas (including law) by the interactions between free individuals, companies, and other organizations. But the individual organizations/companies can be structured in any way they see fit. You seem to think that anarcho-capitalism views individualism as a [positive right]( but in fact ananarcho-capitalism rejects all positive rights.
I'm not saying that people who support XT are bad people. I'm not claiming to be the Emperor of Bitcoin who gets to universally decide now and forever which currencies are the true Bitcoin. That's for individuals and the market to decide. But, motivated mainly by altruism, I have voluntarily decided to try to manage in a way which is consistent, good for the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, and to a very large extent free-speech. This decision isn't particularly motivated by my anarcho-capitalism. It would have been just as ethically right to make completely unmoderated, or make it super-moderated where only things that I believe to be true are allowed. In any case, in reaction to my policies, people can choose to use or not.


That'd definitely not be Bitcoin any more. People agreed to use Bitcoin with the promise that there would be no more than 21 million bitcoins. Breaking that promise will always result in a separate currency, no matter what anyone says.

Just the fact that several notable experts (not even necessarily a majority) strongly oppose something is probably enough to determine that there can presently be no economic consensus. You probably don't have to analyze the experts' arguments at all. Just the mere fact that they strongly oppose something will be enough to split the economy if any hardfork is attempted. (I'm not saying that you should *trust* anyone's arguments, only recognize that their arguments will have large effects whether true or not.) Maybe if a debate drags on really long you might have to consider the possibility that an expert's arguments are bad and the *entire* economy will end up completely ignoring that expert. At the end of the day it's the economy that decides, though experts/devs are extremely important in the decision-making process.
I guess this is pretty good in general. Ideally everyone would be able to just choose whichever rules they wanted and still somehow be able to transact with everyone else, but that's impossible. TBH, if everyone had the same level of expertise and put together their own compatible full node software, it'd probably be a lot more difficult to predict what the economy would end up doing in case of a controversial hard fork proposal, so that might actually be more messy.

A major problem with that proposal is that it sort-of assumes that everyone uses the same policies. For example, it assumes that everyone's "mintxfeerelay" setting is the same, and doesn't work properly if they are different. Also, miners could still intentionally create blocks that require the full MAX_BLOCK_SIZE download if they want. More research is necessary to determine whether these issues can be avoided and if not, how big the issues are and how large the max block size can be in light of these potential failures.
In any case, the max block size should increase *after* the network is ready for it, not before.


They already do, but it's not enough to convince them to validate blocks properly, apparently... And the blocks still need to go through the proper Bitcoin network eventually.

Bitcoin businesses have always been told that they absolutely must run full nodes for this exact reason. Because all businesses run full nodes, if miners start producing a long invalid chain, SPV clients will be unable to transact with everyone important. This'll let them know that something is wrong, and they'll have to either move to a full node or stop transacting until the issue is sorted out. The mere existence of this protection also removes the incentive for miners to even try to break away from Bitcoin, so it'll probably never happen except by accident (like the BIP 66 "SPV mining" thing).
Rule by miners would just be a terrible way of making decisions. Why should we trust a few people in China to make good decisions for us? Miners largely don't even have the same incentives as most Bitcoin users.

@_date: 2017-11-02 19:26:34
If I were them, how I'd fix it is:
* Increase the block maturity to 450 blocks.
* Make it so that block subsidies still being matured are retroactively reduced if blocks are being generated too quickly, in order to limit money-creation to roughly 12.5 BCH per 10 minutes. In other words, the system ensures that each 450-block run of blocks generates BCH at no more than around 12.5 BCH per 10 minutes by scaling-down the subsidies for all of the blocks in that run when necessary.
Amusingly, this can be done as a softfork.
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:33:55
Right now the average block size is only around 400 kB and doesn't look to be increasing very quickly. (It's the average block size that matters, not the burst size. If blocks happen to be full when you're trying to transact, but the average block size is below 1 MB, then you'll always *eventually* get into a block if your fee is somewhat reasonable, and you can get into a block faster by paying a higher fee.) So I don't think that it's necessary to do a stop-gap increase now. It's likely that by the time blocks start looking like they might become consistently full in the near future, either consensus will be reached on some fully-baked long-term max block size increase schedule, or off-chain solutions like Lightning will come into existence and soak up most of the on-chain transaction volume. If it's a choice between increasing the limit to 2 MB and a situation where there's no reasonable way for people to transact, then 2 MB is the clear choice, and getting consensus for this stop-gap hardfork will be easy in this emergency situation.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:53:49


I kind of agree with that. It's just not going to be possible to predict the long-term conditions of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network, and the Internet with any sort of accuracy. I feel like it'd be better for the limit's rate of increase to be reevaluted and adjusted every ~4 years, and have a time limit in the code to *force* this to happen. But that's only going to work properly if the developers are more-or-less on the same page and the community doesn't go absolutely nuts each time. Which the current hullabaloo doesn't make me too optimistic about...
Pieter's proposal is maybe the best we can do for now. It's sufficiently conservative that most people will probably find it either "acceptable" or "better than nothing". Maybe the proposal should explicitly mention that it will probably be necessary and appropriate to manually adjust the limit or rate upward with a hardfork. It already does say that a soft fork should be done if the limit ends up being too loose. (A soft fork is different than a soft limit. After a soft fork, it would be impossible to create a block larger than the new limit without a hardfork.)

IIRC everyone ended up agreeing to P2SH (though sometimes grudgingly).
Everyone's definition of Bitcoin now includes P2SH. So P2SH is certainly Bitcoin now. Even if P2SH had been implemented through a "hostile hardfork" similar to XT and then everyone had been convinced to move to this (at-the-time) altcoin and call it Bitcoin, that wouldn't be relevant now. I wouldn't be advocating returning to the "true, original Bitcoin" without P2SH. (Though I think that in fact there was economic consensus.)

Yes, sidechains are one good method for quick-and-dirty scaling. Keep in mind that RSK is a federated sidechain, so it's centralized to a large extent. But it'd be totally fine for storing a few hundred dollars of value at a time.
Sidechains have a fixed exchange rate with BTC, so you don't buy and sell RSK like you would an altcoin: you can always trade 1 BTC for some fixed number of RSK and vice-versa. The RSK currency basically *is* BTC.
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:16:52
Maybe, though I hope not. Any centralized group that can (or de facto always successfully does) make decisions can eventually be corrupted. And democracy would be even worse, since democracy is just amazingly terrible at making good decisions. So far we've more-or-less gotten by on an informal consensus-based approach which I like in general, though many predict that it can't last forever. What I'd like to see is rule changes becoming less and less frequent as Bitcoin becomes perfect. Once Bitcoin becomes perfect, it'll be the dream that we all want: an absolutely untouchable, tamper-proof, decentralized computer system that autonomously enforces a set of rules *no matter what*. Sidechains are a good step toward this, since they'll allow feature enhancements without modifying Bitcoin. (Though I currently have some security concerns with decentralized sidechains.)

Miners are irrelevant. If the hard fork is activated at 75% of miners, but without significant economic support, then Bitcoin is nearly unaffected while XT finds itself segregated from the Bitcoin economy.
If somehow it becomes certain that 90% of the *economy* will move to the XT currency, then *possibly* Bitcoin Core could go along with it. It'd be very controversial among the Core devs even then. Though it's difficult to determine how much of the economy would *actually* stick their neck out to support XT. Even if exchanges say that they're definitely going to drop Bitcoin and switch to XT, they are certainly lying if they have any sense -- what they'll actually do is stick with the economic majority so that they maximize the number of customers they can support. I could maybe see some exchanges announcing that they've switched to XT, but I can pretty much guarantee you that they'll switch away from XT at the last minute if the rest of the economy doesn't join them in this "suicide pact".
@_date: 2015-07-02 08:21:53


You shouldn't. Bitcoin is still beta software. Buying tons of BTC is a big risk. Probably it's unlikely to lose *all* value in the short-term, but I wouldn't be utterly shocked if it dropped to $100, for example. I'm personally willing to take the risk of owning many bitcoins, but it *is* a big risk, and that's not for everyone.
It'd probably be best to put a large part of your savings into physical assets like gold. It's a good idea to use Bitcoin for more short-term transactions, though, especially when dealing with online international payments. (Bitcoin point-of-sale transactions aren't very comfortable yet, though this can be improved in the future.)
In any case, I recommend minimizing the amount of value that you store in any sort of bank/brokerage account. Even just holding physical Euros is better than keeping your money in the bank.

You're probably thinking "majority", not "consensus". Without consensus (ie. near-unanimity) in the *economy*, Bitcoin splits into multiple pieces for at least a while, hurting everyone. Without dev consensus, economic consensus is very unlikely.

You could use bitcoind's [accounts feature]( The `move` command adjusts the internal account balances and creates an internal transaction without actually creating a block chain transaction. bitcoind doesn't itself support separate login credentials for different accounts, so you'll have to build yourself a little web wallet or something that handles authentication, but this is very easy with accounts.

No one knew about Lightning-like technology at that time. In reality, you *can* have an awful lot of transactions with 1 MB. Though the max block size should indeed be raised as much as safely possible. 8 MB is not safe right now. And certainly this "hostile hardfork" is not the right way to do this change. Here's what Satoshi said when jgarzik published a patch that would have created an altcoin similar to XT:

The Mueller report mentioned that BTC was used by the involved Russians, and we know due to sanctions-related address blacklists that some sanctioned entities in Iran are using BTC. Probably part of the reason they were using BTC was due to sanctions, and their usage of BTC probably continues. Interestingly, the Russians weren't merely laundering money through BTC: they mined BTC via a cloud miner and then bought hosting with BTC directly -- the beginnings of a closed-loop economy.
But their current usage is negligible, I guess. If Iran made an announcement of "OK guys, we're done with USD. We're switching 100% to BTC from now on. BTC is integral to our government's operation now," *that'd* be a real "kicked the hornet's nest and the swarm is headed towards us" type of situation. The US spends $700 billion per year on military, and a big piece of that is aimed at Iran. The US establishment really wants Iran crushed. With just a tiny fraction of this military budget, Bitcoin could be seriously disrupted, such as via the creation of evil miners run by or subsidized by the US government. There would be ways to keep Bitcoin operational &amp; free even despite this, but it would be difficult and unpleasant.
I don't think that they're likely to adopt BTC in a major way like that, though, since:
 * Iran and Russia are authoritarian regimes, and they don't want BTC proliferating within their borders.
 * To *buy* things, they mostly need USD, not BTC.
 * They should know that BTC would currently have serious problems withstanding attack by the US government.

To a large extent, this problem is caused by not running an up-to-date full node. SPV wallets *by definition* have worse security, which is why every good source of Bitcoin information has always said that using a full node is **required** for miners and businesses, and desirable for anyone else. If you used the latest version of Bitcoin Core, then you would have been almost entirely unaffected by this issue. If you're using a reduced-security wallet, then you shouldn't be surprised when the exact problems with SPV that people have been warning about forever actually occur and hurt your security.
The only thing about this incident that makes me concerned about the future of Bitcoin is how it brings to mind the possibility of full nodes becoming so rare that an invalid fork would not have been correctable. If the miners could not have been reached and it turned out that all of the big exchanges were also using only SPV security, the legitimate network might have been lost (from a practical/economic viewpoint) to the (unknowing/incompetent in this case) tyranny of miners overnight. Thankfully we're not to that level yet, though I feel like we were too close for comfort.
It is a big problem that miners aren't validating blocks properly, and there are several ideas being discussed for improving this in the future.

You haven't read enough, then. Two-thirds of Bitcoin experts are strongly opposed to 8 MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:14:41


Not true. There is still about 5% of mining power that will mine invalid blocks, and some substantial portion of mining power (maybe as high as 25%) that will blindly build off of bad blocks. Therefore, it is *very possible* for transactions that later become invalid to receive a confirmation or two in wallets other than the latest Bitcoin Core releases, and even 6+ confirmations are within the realm of possibility. That's why there are still prominent alerts on bitcoin.org, bitcointalk.org, etc. When the probability of invalid confirmations returns to reasonable levels, these alerts will be changed or removed.

USDT is very risky. I basically expect it to collapse at any time, and I don't recommend using it. But I don't *think* that USDT is the main driver of the recent BTC increase; the market seems much larger than anything that USDT alone could create, and a lot of exchanges don't even use USDT.

Sidechains (as they're almost always imagined) have a fixed exchange rate with Bitcoin. So if a sidechain out-competes Bitcoin for whatever reason, Bitcoin users can just convert their bitcoins to "SideChainCoins" whenever they want -- converting earlier or later won't affect the exchange rate.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:39:32
So let's say that you buy 10 BTC at $200 = $2000 total. Then when the price goes up to $201 you gamble this and win 50 BTC = $10050 plus your wager. I don't think the refunded wager is directly taxed, so your gambling winnings are $10050. Additionally, you spent 10 BTC in this process so you have capital gains of $201\*10 - $200\*10 = $10. So now you have 60 BTC with a cost basis (ie. "the price you bought the BTC at") of $201. Then if you sell all of these bitcoins at $300 later on, that'll create capital gains of $300\*60 - $201\*60 = $5940. (If you have multiple batches of coins with different cost bases, you can choose the ones you're spending arbitrarily. But you can't reuse these batches once used.) 
Probably you should consult a CPA.

Right, it doesn't matter that much if lower-fee transactions are delayed for a few hours. If someone has a time-sensitive transaction (somewhat rare in my experience), they can add a small extra amount of fee. Bitcoin Core will compute the necessary extra fee automatically, even.

I've thought of that before, and I think that it is better for communicating addresses verbally and via handwriting. But 99% of the time, addresses are copy/pasted, and for that usage it's much worse to have separate words like that because they're longer, not as easily separated from surrounding text, etc.
IMO it'd be a good idea to have a "verbal address format" which would use words like that, and wallets would have a built-in feature to convert normal addresses to/from the verbal format.
One design issue to consider is that not everyone uses English. You could have a different format per language, or maybe you could use made-up words composed of syllables that most languages can easily pronounce. (Or everyone could just live with English, since it is very common.)

Also, for O(n^2) the steepness of the curve is unspecified -- the curve could be right next to the y axis and look almost vertical, or it could remain below the O(n) line throughout the entire visible section of the graph (but it'll *eventually* go above the O(n) line).

XT is programmed to become a separate network/currency from Bitcoin in the future. If your exchange uses XT after XT diverges from Bitcoin, then your bitcoins will probably end up being converted to "xt-coins" incompatible with Bitcoin. When XT fails economically, these xt-coins will be worthless. Therefore, you should not use an exchange that supports XT. Also, if you think that XT has any chance of sucessfully hijacking Bitcoin, you should withdraw bitcoins even from Bitcoin exchanges to a cold wallet and hold them until everything settles. This will ensure that you still have *something* when the dust settles, though if XT ends up tearing the Bitcoin economy apart you will probably still lose significant purchasing power.

Certain features can't be added without hurting Bitcoin's security. In particular, if a script can ever become invalid after once being valid, then this can cause very serious problems during chain forks. Other features could be added but are generally recognized as more trouble than they're worth. For example, if you had loops, what interesting/useful things could you *do* with loops that you can't already do with Script as it exists today?
From a theoretical perspective, Bitcoin's Script is just as Turing-complete as Ethereum. When people say "Turing-complete", they usually mean something else. For example, no matter how complex Script was, you wouldn't necessarily expect that it would be able to access its own sequence/lockTime info so that it could replicate CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Similarly, even though lambda calculus is theoretically Turing complete, it doesn't have a way of writing text to a screen, since it's purely mathematical...

No, I think I made that pretty clear on many occasions. Once the temporary rules are over, you can discuss hardforks, just not *software which implements hardforks*, since the latter is a working (or programmed-to-one-day-be-working), *separate* currency/network from Bitcoin. It'd even be OK to discuss specific chunks of code that implement a hardfork (and in fact I allowed some of this from XT previously), just as long as it's not actually runnable, usable software yet. Because runnable, usable software containing a hardfork change without consensus is not Bitcoin.
**Consensus is possible!** I believe that the max block size will be increased in some way before the end of 2017, *with* consensus. And other, more clear-cut hardforks may be done even sooner.
Controversial "hardforks" and a too-high max block size are both *centralizing* things. If a majority of Bitcoiners can somehow force a large minority into breaking the rules of Bitcoin which they accepted, then that's just more of the same politics that I sought to escape with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin philosophy in my mind is that "your bitcoin is secured in a way that is physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter a majority of miners, no matter what." If Bitcoin becomes majoritarian, then that all goes out the window. And with too-high max block sizes, everyone will be relying on a small handful of centralized full nodes -- those'll be the banks of the huge blocks world, and they'll be far worse than Lightning servers or whatever because there will be *no way whatsoever* to do a decentralized, trustless transaction.
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:25:10
Right. Miners are employees of the network. In hardfork situations, what matters is what the *economy* does. You're part of the economy, so you get a "vote" if you actually use a full node for your economic transactions. (Simply running a full node on a server somewhere is worthless.) Entities that are more economically important like Coinbase, BitPay, etc. have much larger votes, though.
If 90% of miners move to some hardfork but no one else does, then all we'll have is slow blocks for a while. Those miners will be ignored and any coins they mine will be worthless, since they will have left the Bitcoin network.

They might be able to avoid this *particular* issue by banning version 2 block headers, but that's basically just an accident. In general, SPV nodes can't check whether a block chain follows the Bitcoin consensus rules, so it's always possible for them to be tricked into accepting an invalid chain.

Fun fact: that was written by the creator of @_date: 2015-07-28 09:18:49
If someone reuses one of his addresses for multiple purposes/occasions, then this is bad practice (as I described in my previous post), but it won't cause incoming transactions to simply *disappear*.
A somewhat separate issue is that you need to follow the recipient's payment instructions properly. An address is like an "invoice ID", not like an account number. You must only ever pay to an address as directed by the recipient. For example, if you pay for a widget via an address provided by the seller and then the next day decide that you want another widget and send more money to the same address without clearing it with the seller, then you're asking for trouble. At best this will cause some confusion. At worst, the seller will have lost his wallet between the first payment and the second, and the second payment will be *your* loss. The intended recipient will not be legally or ethically obligated to compensate you if money is lost in this way.
If you follow the payment instructions to the letter, then any losses (maybe due to address reuse by the recipient) aren't your problem. If you deviate from instructions or *assume* things about the recipient, then you're being rude (by maybe messing up the recipient's accounting) and taking an unnecessary risk of throwing away your bitcoins by accident.
(Your disappearing transaction may well have been caused by something else, though. Maybe it wasn't ever broadcast to the network properly.)

It has basically always been known that Bitcoin would not be able to *directly* support super cheap transactions forever, and transactions have never been instant (in the sense of being instantly non-reversible). Anyone who promised super cheap transactions forever in all cases or instantly secure transactions was badly misinformed. I looked through just my own posts to find some examples of talking about this (probably someone else gave more details/predictions than I did):
* [I complained in 2010 about someone calling Bitcoin transactions "free"](
* [In 2011 I talked about how "instant transactions and low fees" can be done using centralized servers (implying that this *can't* be done directly in Bitcoin long-term), somewhat like the later hub-and-spoke idea](
* [In 2012 I commented on a sort of "proto-Lightning" proposal: "I could see this being commonly used for micropayments and instant transfers. It might even be the main transaction method in the future if the max block size stays fixed at 1 MB and blockchain transactions get really expensive."](

I don't want to speak for him, but it seems to me that you either don't correctly understand his position or you don't understand Bitcoin. I know Luke and his arguments here pretty well, and none of his positions on this topic are objectively "not fine". You might reasonably *disagree* with him, but that doesn't mean that what he's saying is nonsensical/unreasonable.
I and I think most other Bitcoin experts believe that a little congestion every now and then wouldn't be a big deal. Congestion does not mean that we'll "hit a wall". It means that you'll either need to wait a little longer for confirmations or you'll have to pay a little higher fee. The "stress tests" where people have intentionally filled blocks for a while have shown that Bitcoin can work this way without serious problems.
It's a common mistake to only look at the issue of demand, but the more important issue is one of supply. The network can only support so much transaction volume before it loses decentralization. The purpose of the max block size is to prevent the network's tx volume from increasing so much that centralization is lost. It doesn't matter how much you want higher volume, or how high fees are, or how Bitcoin's price is affected: the  priority is decentralization, and this must be maintained no matter what. The exact max block size that would cause too much centralization isn't known (and "too much centralization" isn't an objective criteria), though many experts believe that 1 MB is in fact a bit *too high*. Hence the great difficulty in agreeing to any sort of increase.

I thought about this for a while, but it can't be done properly. The image could be added, but there's no way to add some sort of alt text so that you get something when copy/pasting or viewing the page with a non-graphical browser. Having people type `[BTC]( instead of `[whatever]( can't be enforced, and the "BTC" text will be clickable even when people do it, which is undesirable. Since the only possible implementations of the symbol would be messy, it's far better to just do without the symbol and write "BTC".
It's too bad Reddit bans  or the font could be added via a data URI. My BTC.ttf font is only 1.8 kB, so it easily fits in a data URI.

Wladamir, Greg, and Pieter are opposed to it. That's enough to block consensus. Consensus is a high bar. And it works both ways: if Gavin and Mike are strongly opposed to Pieter's BIP, then this will also block consensus on that BIP.
Other than the core devs, big Bitcoin companies (especially Coinbase, BitPay, and exchanges) could block consensus, as could large groups of average users who are collectively capable of making reasonable arguments and exerting economic force (probably not just random unknown people complaining about nothing).
Even though consensus is such a high bar, I think that in practice any hardfork that gets consensus among the Bitcoin Core devs and makes it into Bitcoin Core has a good chance of succeeding. But again, the developers would just be spearheading the effort, and many others could block them if necessary.
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:09:19
Clearly not, since hardforks have been actively discussed for the last several months. I explained in my post how a hardfork is handled: it is OK only if we can confidently predict that essentially 100% of the Bitcoin economy will accept the hardfork without issue. This has happened before and it can happen in the future, even with a max block size increase. But XT doesn't meet this criteria by a long shot.
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:15:39


That's not true. If 99% of miners decided right now to start producing 2 MB blocks, then all full nodes would simply ignore them. These miners would have left the Bitcoin network. SPV wallets might be tricked for a while, but hopefully there are no especially important economic actors relying on SPV wallets.
If you argue that miners *should* have ultimate power over the network, then that's a very significant change that would damage Bitcoin's security. For example, what would be the incentive for miners to *not* debase the currency?

If the government is putting people in camps, then I suppose Bitcoin might be better than gold. Though at the end of the day we all live in the physical world. Even Bitcoin can be blocked by governments if they try hard enough and are violent enough. If your government is putting people in camps, probably you need to leave the country ASAP or prepare to defend your life/liberty/assets in armed resistance. I doubt that living under the radar with Bitcoin in an extremely oppressive government would work well long-term.
With capital controls, you'd just trade entirely using gold/silver as a money and avoid using the local currency entirely. For international transactions, you'd want to use BTC, first trading gold for BTC via a physical local trader. The exchange rates might be quite skewed due to the extra arbitrage cost (maybe involving smuggling of gold/Euros across borders), but a usable market should form unless the government is suppressing these transactions severely (in which case, see my first paragraph).

Even though Reddit is going nuts right now, among experts the debate is basically on hold for now because the expert community is badly split, and everyone is sick of talking about it. About two-thirds of experts are strongly opposed to any significant increase in the near term, and the other third tend to believe that a large increase should happen soon. BIP 100/101/102 are strongly opposed by the former group, and the latter group believes that Pieter's proposal is uselessly small.
Wladamir, Greg, and Pieter oppose any near-term increase, so it's not getting into Bitcoin Core any time soon. And XT is an altcoin that no one sane will use.
There will be a series of [Bitcoin expert workshops]( to discuss (not debate/decide) the issue from a rigorous technical/academic standpoint starting in September.


XT's current 0.10 release will remain on Bitcoin, though this might change in later releases. 0.11A and beyond are programmed to diverge from Bitcoin at some point in the future. Currently the divergence is triggered based on the percentage of mining support (which is very different from economic/user support), but Mike Hearn has said that he might just program it to ignore the Bitcoin chain if enough miners can't be persuaded to jump off this cliff.

Yeah. You have to use the best decision-making methods available to you, and in this case an education guess is all we have. Maybe some seriously in-depth research would be able to get a somewhat more precise answer, but I don't know how this research would be done. You have to model a very complicated and varied network.


Excess supply drives demand. Blocks will gradually tend toward filling up as much as they can, even if people are just storing arbitrary data in the block chain for fun.


Several experts have proposed this actually, but it's probably politically impossible.


I haven't seen that sort of attitude in that past/present, unfortunately. It has become more and more common for companies to outsource all functions of a full node to other companies rather than deal with the hassle of setting aside 50 GB of space and an always-on daemon. I'd expect this to get a lot worse if companies also had to provision a large amount of bandwidth for Bitcoin, a lot more storage, and more computing power, especially since this "economic strength" aspect of Bitcoin is a common goods problem.
I prefer to be pretty conservative about all this, and not increase the max block size when it's not strictly necessary just because the network *might* be able to survive it intact and sufficiently decentralized.

The problems with Reddit go very deep. It's not something you can blame the administration about too much. It's very difficult to prevent vote manipulation, voting in general doesn't work well, the overall Reddit moderation/admin culture is bad (including many mods protesting now...), the way bans and registration work give persistent attackers an advantage over mods, mod tool insufficiency encourages exclusionary and overly-strict moderation, etc. These things aren't going to be fixed by just cloning Reddit.

Another major problem with the US's health care system is that the supply of doctors is artificially restricted. You can't practice medicine without getting a license, but they only allow so many people per year to get one (as a result of AMA lobbying with the goal of increasing doctor wages).
Neither Bitcoin nor Tor are anonymous enough for safely breaking laws, but hopefully in the future as technology advances it will be possible to bypass many of these ridiculous laws totally risk-free.

Usually either the sender or recipient will be a full node that will rebroadcast properly. It's unnecessary and too burdensome to expect nodes on the network to do the rebroadcasting.


That's undesirable because often the sender will *want* the transaction to expire because they'll want to resend it with higher fees. In fact, the network currently remembers transactions for too long (several days, probably), and it's planned for this to be reduced in the future.

BS&amp;T only allowed high-volume "investors" to directly deposit money. Burt was operating a passthrough, where he would "invest" smaller amounts of money in BS&amp;T for people. Everyone who used this service knew that they were dealing with BS&amp;T with Burt only as an intermediary, and the risks were clearly stated in the passthrough contract. So it's not reasonable to hold Burt responsible for BS&amp;T's scam, especially since he apparently trusted that BS&amp;T was not a ponzi till the end and probably lost a ton of money himself. (BS&amp;T's operator was previously a highly-trusted, prolific trader, so people trusted him.)

Right. It's very unlikely that any 0-day vulnerability in ECDSA itself will allow an attacker to break keys in less than a few hours. The quantum algorithm for breaking EC keys does still require a non-trivial amount of computation, and the first quantum computers will be super slow, so it'll probably take at least some weeks for the first sufficiently large quantum computer to break a key.
If QC ever becomes a real threat, the current plan is to switch to a Lamport signature scheme. Lamport signatures are QC-proof, considered extremely strong in general, and are very fast, though even gmaxwell's especially size-efficient Lamport scheme has signatures that are a bit uncomfortably large. Address reuse will be incompatible with Lamport signatures because each time you sign something it becomes much easier for someone to brute-force your private key. This is one thing I was thinking of when I said, "it's best to get used to not reusing addresses now."

I'd be surprised if there weren't some examples, but nothing comes to mind. ReactOS has similarly been actively developed at pre-1.0 versions for many years. TeX has a similar philosophy, though I don't know how much development it had pre-1.0.
It'd be easy to give it version 1.0. Satoshi even considered doing this at one point. But the fact of the matter is that Bitcoin *is* still experimental. It's basically certain that the network/currency would not survive long-term if development stopped, and it's not yet known how to keep Bitcoin functional as it grows -- that's an area of ongoing research. Clearly the software situation isn't so great when most people can't/won't use Bitcoin Core even when SPV wallets are so insecure that we need big warnings everywhere about it.

Not really. Miners already use a [separate network]( to relay blocks amongst themselves, so any sort of propagation penalty aside from complete rejection isn't very meaninful. Nodes might reject especially large blocks, but if everyone chooses a different max block size then the network/currency will fragment into hundreds of separate pieces.

The main problem is ensuring Bitcoin's [economic security]( so connectivity and uptime aren't so important to the network (beyond just being able to comfortably use the network). For the same reason, it's good if average users can and do run full nodes.


That might be something of a bad sign, actually. Full nodes are only useful for the network's economic security if they're actually being used for real transactions. If people are filling up the network with nodes that just sit there and answer a few queries, then that's not so great.

I don't require 100% consensus (though that is ideal). I will accept hardforks only if they are unlikely to cause the economy to seriously fragment. In other words, I won't accept a hardfork that will probably have significant "holdouts" on the old currency. This is probably possible in the max block size case only if the proposal is clearly very low-risk, or if the limited max block size causes serious ongoing issues (for example, if the fee market fails to properly develop as expected).
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:21:04
More-or-less, but it's not a one-to-one relationship between bandwidth and max block size. To be a constructive peer, you need to *quickly* upload new blocks to many of your *8+* peers. So 8 MB blocks would require something very roughly like (8 MB * 8 bits * 7 peers) / 30 seconds = 15 Mbit/s upstream, which is an extraordinary upstream capacity.
A more accurate/useful statistic is the growth/decline in the number of full nodes. The numbers have been going down for the past few years, which indicates that it's probably still too expensive to run a full node.
There are also some other issues. For example, there's no incentive for miners to keep the UTXO set small, but this will be very important for scalability in the coming years.

It's not an objective criteria. If it was, I wouldn't be able to use words like "noticeable" and "negligible". Everyone will need to individually decide what has consensus.

Off-chain transactions still need the Bitcoin block chain to "settle up" occasionally. With Lightning, for example, users will need to do a real Bitcoin transaction every few months(?). Usage of the Bitcoin block chain allows Lightning (and some other solutions) to be trust-free: the semi-centralized servers can never steal your money.


First of all, if there was often extra space in blocks, people would probably start using the block chain primarily to store data, or for microtransactions. I don't think that higher volume would necessarily correlate with higher price.
Even if higher volume did equal higher price, I doubt that this would be enough to motivate people to run full nodes. The incentive for running a full node is mainly so that you can be sure that your received transactions are correct. It doesn't really help you to secure your existing bitcoins except in a very broad ecosystem sense (which is a public goods problem).


If blocks are getting full, yes. If there's no cap, then there'd be less reason to use/develop off-chain solutions because you'd always be able to get your transactions into the Bitcoin block chain directly. Your transactions/bitcoins would probably stop being secure, though, because the network can't handle this much volume in a secure/decentralized way, but there'd be nothing stopping users and miners from continuously increasing the transaction volume.


At first glance it looks like no cap should work because there should be some market mechanism to keep things working. But when you look deeper you find that the incentives are all wrong, encouraging limitless block size increases. A dynamic block cap voted on by miners is nearly the same as no cap at all, since miners have a strong incentive to increase block sizes. There's a proposal called "flex cap" that I like which dynamically adjusts the max block size by allowing miners to vote for higher blocks, but requires them to mine at a higher difficulty to so vote.

Collecting your own entropy is somewhat frowned upon because the OS can collect far more/better entropy than any userspace program, and it's very difficult to write a CSPRNG that's as secure as the OS CSPRNG in most cases. The biggest worry is that your program's CSPRNG/entropy will be bad, and you will use it instead of the good OS randomness.
[It is planned]( to add an enhanced CSPRNG and more entropy collection to Bitcoin Core itself just in case the OS is broken. The result of this will be mixed with the OS's randomness to ensure that the end result is equal to or better than the what the OS would have produced.

* There's the risk of the network shattering into many pieces. If all miners agree to produce 2 MB blocks but you only accept blocks up to 1.9 MB, then you will be permanently cut off from the network. It's even worse if the miners are split about it, since you might have separate but completely functional versions of the Bitcoin network and currency operating at the same time.
* The max block size might actually end up being too low. Miners would be incentivized to mine only on chains that they think 99% of the economy would accept. If people are really active about choosing their own max block sizes, then the "lowest common denominator" might end up being something like 250 kB...
* Probably the above point won't be much of an issue because pretty much everyone would just use the defaults. But this makes the whole thing pretty pointless. The Core devs increasing the defaults would be almost equivalent to increasing the max block size. The attitude would probably be, "If you don't use &lt;the new defaults&gt; or higher, then you'll be cut off from Bitcoin, and that's just the way it is." Miners would all start producing blocks up to the new default at some specified flag day, just like a hardfork. There wouldn't actually be much choice for users.

Almost every wallet has at least one orange "warning" point on the Choose Your Wallet page. That's because bitcoin.org likes to be accurate, and the Bitcoin ecosystem is in reality very immature, so *all* wallets have problems. Electrum's "vulnerable environment" point means "if you install malware, it can steal your bitcoins". Not terribly surprising. I think that Electrum is pretty good overall, though it does have some problems with anonymity and, like all lightweight wallets, confirmation reliability (ie. it's not very difficult for an attacker to send you a transaction that shows up as having 1 confirmation when it is actually invalid and will never *really* have any confirmations).

No one controls Bitcoin. If you run a full node, then your node will follow its rules no matter what anyone else does. It doesn't matter whether *all* miners or even all other full nodes disagree.
However, you will be greatly incentivized to switch to a full node with different rules if all existing Bitcoin-accepting services require that you do so in order to transact with them. So really it's the Bitcoin *economy* that will decide hardfork issues. This includes even individual Bitcoin users, though bigger economic actors (e.g. exchanges) have more weight. Note that this is not any sort of democracy or majority decision. If 60% of the Bitcoin economy supports one side of a hardfork and 40% supports the other side, this is an absolute disaster because the network/currency/economy can remain split like this potentially indefinitely. (And it's also possible for the smaller side to eventually win economically even if the other side was initially leading.) In this situation you've basically created two separate cryptocurrencies from one, and they'll need to compete for market share.
It's not really important what "Bitcoin Core" will do because anyone can create a fork of Bitcoin Core, and it's not really clear what "Bitcoin Core" even is. AFAIK either Gavin or Wladamir could single-handedly take complete control of the github repo, but would this still be Bitcoin Core if it exists outside of developer consensus? (I'd say no.)
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:49:19


The people who knowingly stick with the 40% side would disagree with you. What makes you right? If majority opinion makes something the truth, then we should start a poll to end world hunger.


A 60-40 split could be maintained indefinitely. Some miners would mine on the original currency and some would mine on the other one. Miners built onto the longest *valid* chain, so they won't build onto another currency's block chain no matter how much work it has.
There are economic reasons why you wouldn't really expect such a close split to last long, but it's technically possible. And in a 60-40 split, either side could end up getting ~100% market share. The two currencies would compete on the free market, and either could win in the end.

One important thing to realize is that the Bitcoin protocol is already completely set for Lightning, and there's even software which already exists for using a basic form of LN. The issue is that it's not anywhere near *usable* right now. If you hired a thousand skilled software developers, you'd have a perfect LN-capable wallet very quickly, since there's no need for more consensus changes, etc.; we mainly just need a complete and easy-to-use LN-capable wallet. But in reality there are only a small handful of people working on it right now, so it'll probably increase in usability fairly slowly from its current state of "technically possible but totally impractical" to the end goal of "transactions are as cheap and easy as Bitcoin in 2010, and nobody needs to know anything about how LN works if they don't want to".

Depends how low-energy. Someone still needs to mine, and the Bitcoin network should have more mining power than any reasonably-possible attacker. The mining power doesn't need to be as high as it is now or at any specific value, though.

Must all Litecoin sites allow Feathercoin discussion as being on-topic? Does it really matter if you define Feathercoin as a forkcoin of Litecoin instead of a separate network/currency?

There are several reasons for some sort of limit (maybe not a fixed value), but the most important one is: For economic reasons, the Bitcoin network can't work securely unless many people use full nodes for actual commerce (just running one in the cloud somewhere isn't helpful), though the exact amount of the economy that should be backed by full nodes is debatable. If there was no max block size, then miners would probably be incentivized to create the biggest blocks they could, since it costs them almost nothing to add transactions to blocks and they would get some fees. Larger blocks make it significantly more difficult to run a properly-functioning full node; in particular, you currently need to be able to *upload* a block several times within about 30 seconds. Therefore, no max block size -&gt; too-large blocks -&gt; an economy not sufficiently backed by full nodes -&gt; insecurity.
Also see:  
At first glance, it looks like this should be a situation where a stable market would develop. But this doesn't work because the network has a limited capacity (ie. the maximum amount of transaction volume that can exist before too many full nodes are pushed out and the network becomes insecure), but miners aren't really incentivized to keep blocks below this limit, and there is no other mechanism for preventing transaction volume from exceeding the network's capacity and becoming insecure. The network's capacity isn't built into the price of creating transactions or blocks except via the max block size.

30 is just a conservative guess at a safe value. AFAIK there might be as much as 25% of mining power mining on the wrong chain, so it's within the realm of possibility that they get a 6-block lead over the remaining miners, and 1- and 2-block leads are fairly likely. A 30-block lead seems sufficiently unlikely.

Bitcoin is already set for LN. No more softforks are necessary. So LN can be as careless as it wants, really, since it will only affect the minuscule subset of Bitcoin users who use LN.
The software just isn't ready yet. You can use it for making full-security LN transactions, even routed via multiple LN nodes, but it's totally impractical right now because:
* You have to mostly-manually find peers, figure out the LN topology, and set up channels.
* All parties need to remain online constantly with ports forwarded.
* You need a bitcoind running and configured for the LN daemon (eg. you may need to enable txindex and then reindex).
* None of the LN daemons have a built-in Bitcoin wallet AFAIK, so you'd have to constantly move BTC between your Bitcoin wallet and the LN daemon.
* None of the LN daemons consider themselves to be ready for prime-time, and currently only work on testnet. (It's trivial to make them work on mainnet, but if they don't consider themselves ready, then you shouldn't.)
* Etc.
These things are all fixable, but it takes *time*. AFAIK there's only like 3 people working on it full-time (in ~5 separate projects...), and they can only work so fast. Keep in mind that the top Core developers mostly don't work on LN: they're focused on Core.
I think that it may be quite some time before LN reaches a point where ordinary Bitcoiners can comfortably use it. I've [long advocated]( blinded bearer certificates as a far easier stop-gap measure for instant and anonymous off-chain payments, but I haven't had time to work on this myself, and apparently nobody else is working on it. Sidechains like RSK are another possible quick-and-dirty solution which could become popular before LN.

Bitcoin Core has a GUI for this. Enable Coin Control in the options and then on the send page, click the "Inputs..." button. There you will see the priority of all of the different "coins" in your wallet, and if you manually choose which input coins to use for building the transaction, it'll tell you what your final transaction's priority will be.

Transaction outputs are never part of the witness, so SegWit cannot significantly increase the number of outputs that can be created per block, only the number/size of inputs. Even if SegWit allowed for unlimited witness data (ie. an infinite discount), the max number of outputs per block would be more-or-less the same as now. (Actually it'd be somewhat more due to freeing up space in the non-witness parts of blocks, but this is only a constant addition.)
Any increase to the maximum amount of non-witness data that doesn't specifically address this problem will increase the number of allowed outputs per block proportionally with the size increase, which will worsen the UTXO-set growth problem.
In case of emergency, I'd be OK with adding another arbitrary limit like the 1MB limit on the net number of UTXOs each block can create, and then increasing the max block size by a few MB. But some experts really dislike this approach, especially since there's a known (but very complex/difficult) ultimate solution in the form of TXO commitments.

Clearly I imagined the need to stay at 1 MB, since I mentioned it...
[Here's what I said in 2010 about how the max block size should be increased]( (my [modern] emphasis):


As I imagined might possibly happen, the current consensus among Bitcoin experts is that the network is *not* ready to handle bigger blocks yet. It will be ready in the future, but not now. But as I mentioned in those quotes from 2011 and 2012, there are ways for Bitcoin to survive this situation (and this technology has seen substantial advancement since then).
I am personally not very concerned about fees. I think that assurance contracts would be sufficient to incentivize mining. So I don't have any interest in artificially forcing fees to go up. From my viewpoint, the max block size is only to prevent miners from making blocks that the network can't handle, ruining decentralization.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:06:22
A soft fork changes the consensus rules. If the limit is 2 MB and you softfork it down to 1.5 MB, then it will no longer be possible to create blocks larger than 1.5 MB. Increasing it again requires a hardfork.
You're probably thinking of a soft *limit*, where miners would voluntarily keep blocks below a certain limit. But miners have weird incentives that don't align with most Bitcoin users, and they can't generally be trusted. For example, if 75% of miners can easily handle 2 MB blocks but 25% cannot, then the majority will be want to create 2 MB blocks to eliminate their competition. But this will reduce Bitcoin's overall security, and it'll also increase the burden on full nodes. (The only reason that Bitcoin works despite miners being untrustworthy is that the majority of the economy is backed by full nodes, which will always reject illegal actions by miners, no matter how many miners work together. If there were no full nodes, miners would have every incentive to generate tons of extra bitcoins for themselves, since nothing would be able to stop them. Bitcoin is sort of a war between full nodes and miners, where there is currently some sort of uneasy alliance. Giving miners more ammunition against full nodes is a very very bad idea, since it might allow them to break the alliance and win the war, to everyone else's vast detriment.)

There is a significant distinction between soft and hard forks. When you use Bitcoin, you agree to enforce certain core rules. In a soft fork, additional rules are added. In a hard fork, rules are *broken*. While you might not agree to a soft fork, at least the rules that you explicity did agree to are not being broken.
Anyway, I don't think that most people view the lower requirements for a soft fork as being necessarily optimal. It's just how the network works: miners can always reject things, so they can add additional rules if they want. There's no known way to prevent this. When there's consensus to change the rules (same idea as consensus to change the rules in a hard fork), and the rule change is possible as a soft fork, the change is rolled out in two stages: first a soft fork by miners, and then a "hard fork" by full nodes. This makes the rollout quicker and safer. In Satoshi's time all miners were full nodes and most full nodes were miners, so this two-step process wasn't very useful. However, it is very likely that Satoshi anticipated the possibility and usefulness of soft forks because of the OP_NOPx script opcodes, which are perfectly suited for adding new features via soft forks and not useful for anything else.
It is possible that the developers might not put as much care into soft fork changes as they should due to soft fork changes being a lot easier to convince people to adopt and less likely to cause serious problems (for economic reasons). A rule change that is rolled out using the soft fork process still involves a "hard fork" (ie. a change in the core consensus rules) eventually, so it should be treated about as seriously as a hard fork. Though I can't think of any controversial rule changes done via the soft fork process except *maybe* P2SH.
In any case, the rules of Bitcoin can only be changed with consensus (ie. if a change has some noticeable probability of causing the Bitcoin economy to split into two or more non-negligible pieces, then it does not have consensus). Any software that changes the rules of Bitcoin without consensus is not Bitcoin, soft fork or hard fork. For example, I think that there are no miners who would mine a transaction with 0 input value, but this is currently valid by the core rules of Bitcoin. Blocking this sort of transaction is therefore a "soft fork change" that has already completed the soft fork step. But full node software which considers this sort of transaction to be invalid would not be Bitcoin, since this rule change does not have consensus.

The wallets of the sender and recipient are supposed to (and Bitcoin Core does) automatically rebroadcast their 0-conf transactions every few hours. The network only remembers transactions for a while.
When a block is replaced in a reorganization, any transactions in the old block that are not in the new block automatically get put into the mempool if they're still valid.
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:05:11
It's true that invalid blocks would not propagate well if all miners were connected to the Bitcoin network like normal full nodes are, but most miners use a special network semi-separate from the normal Bitcoin network called the [block relay network]( to communicate with each other which (as gmaxwell mentioned) does only SPV validation.
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:57:21
Bitcoin Core still includes the mining stuff. Give it `setgenerate true` via RPC and it'll immediately start CPU mining. But your chance of actually getting a block is so low (even on the fastest CPUs) that it's a complete waste of time/electricity, especially since Bitcoin Core's miner is intentionally unoptimized (it's supposed to be a clear reference for how mining should be done). Buying obsolete, cheap ASICs is better -- the probability of getting a block with obsolete hardware is more on the level of winning a lottery.
@_date: 2016-02-15 07:28:49
No Bitcoiner would want a contentious hardfork if they understood Bitcoin and were rational, but a few notable people and their followers are delusional and think that if a very large percentage of miners support a hardfork, then everyone will just magically follow along with them, even though Bitcoin full nodes [ignore all miners that produce invalid, non-Bitcoin blocks]( This is like saying that if 75% of Bitcoin miners moved to ZetaCoin or whatever, then the entire Bitcoin economy would just *have to* abandon Bitcoin and adopt ZetaCoin.
Non-contentious hardforks are fine. One (arguably) happened in May 2013 without incident because everyone agreed to it, so Bitcoin didn't split economically. But it is rather difficult to get the required amount of consensus, so an alternative is to make changes using softforks instead of hardforks. Most changes can be done with softforks, though often with more complexity compared to a feature-equivalent hardfork.

What do you mean by "build a NAND gate using LN"? LN is composed of just regular Bitcoin transactions -- it's not a separate computing/scripting system. And what would such a NAND gate do? What/where are the inputs and outputs to the gate?
You can easily make a NAND gate in Bitcoin's Script: `OP_BOOLAND OP_NOT`. Script is in fact just as Turing-complete as anything else in the real-world: it can express any algorithm, but is limited by various time and space restrictions. Script was designed to have script size increase linearly with execution steps (ie. no loops, etc.), but *this does not make it not Turing-complete*. However, being Turing-complete doesn't mean that you can do *literally everything*, since being able to express any algorithm doesn't mean anything if you can't access the necessary inputs.
As an example of Bitcoin's Turing-completeness, here is a 3-bit adder in Bitcoin-Script using a gate model (untested and sub-optimal, I wrote it quickly just now):

[Here's the commit where Satoshi added the max block size in a softfork]( Note that there is no miner signalling or anything like that: the limit was just added. That's a UASF. Full nodes just start enforcing new rules, and miners have to follow if they want to keep creating valid blocks. If miners refuse to create valid blocks, then from the perspective of full nodes, it's as if the miners were mining Litecoin blocks: they will be totally ignored, forever. Satoshi always made changes to Bitcoin in this fashion.
The risk is that if a big part of the economy upgrades to the UASF version but miners *and* a big part of the economy refuse to do so, then Bitcoin will irreconcilably split, similar to a hardfork. This is much less likely to happen in a miner-activated softfork, which is why those have often been preferred. But a UASF can be done if it's pretty clear that almost all of the economy will upgrade before the UASF activates.

One of the main advantages of the relay network is that it reduces redundant delivery of data. On the normal Bitcoin network, you usually have to download and upload each transaction at least twice: once as a stand-alone transaction, and once as part of a block. The relay network compresses blocks by keeping track of which transactions each node has already seen, and then just refers to those previously-seen transactions instead of actually sending them when sending a block relay. This makes blocks a lot smaller, which reduces block-relay latency and therefore the number of stales ("orphans") for miners. There are proposals for doing something similar in Bitcoin (eg. IBLT or weak blocks), but this'll always be less efficient than the centralized approach, and these proposals have some problems still being discussed.


Some exchanges/EWallets do this, but I don't know of any software wallets that do this. Miners still get most of their transactions from the Bitcoin P2P network, I think.
Mining centralization is really bad. There are three main attacks that miners can do:
First, miners can break the rules of Bitcoin and create invalid blocks. Full nodes will reject these blocks no matter what, but lightweight nodes will accept them. If most of the economy is backed by full nodes, then this gives miners a massive incentive to follow the rules, and even if they don't, Bitcoin can continue on by just ignoring these miners. But if only a very small part of the economy is backed by full nodes, or if the only significant part of the economy backed by full nodes is cooperating with the rule-breaking miners, then the miners effectively have absolute control over Bitcoin. If this happens, I could easily see a scenario some years down the line in which miners work together with several massive exchanges to push through an increase to the money supply, justifying it by getting the support of famous economists, etc. Most Bitcoin users wouldn't be in a position to stop them, since they would've given up their "vote" by not running a full node.
The defense against this is for most of the economy to run full nodes. Additionally, SegWit opens up the possibility that in the future, SPV-style nodes could receive fraud proofs from full nodes elsewhere on the network which would prove that the longest chain is actually invalid. Then even lightweight nodes would follow the rules of Bitcoin no matter what, assuming they're able to receive the fraud proof messages from full nodes.
Second, miners could censor transactions. It is very worrying that just a small handful of people who are *all in the same country* could be ordered by their government to stop all Bitcoin transactions. They'd just reject all Bitcoin transactions and all blocks of competitors. It can be coded and deployed in hours. Maybe even worse, they could allow only transactions that are somehow "verified" by the government.
One defense against this is to improve Bitcoin transaction anonymity with things like CoinJoin and confidential transactions (CT) so that miners don't know what transactions to censor. The only other defense is to be prepared to change the PoW algorithm as soon as miners do something like this.
Lastly, there is of course double-spending. Though the gains from double-spending tend to be limited, since miners can only double-spend transactions that they themselves have sent. If miners do massive double-spending attacks, or undo large numbers of blocks just to cause havoc, the only solution is a PoW algorithm change.
In general, it's not known how to fix mining centralization. There's been tons of discussion, but no conclusion. Pure PoS has serious known problems. Some are worried that combining PoW with PoS (such as in the Proof of Activity proposal) makes the system much more difficult to analyze, but without any clear benefit. It's very difficult (maybe impossible) to make a PoW algorithm that will be fast on CPUs or GPUs, but not significantly faster on ASICs; additionally, if it's only fast on x86 CPUs, then there are now only two manufacturers of effective mining devices (Intel and AMD), and the people with the biggest mining power will probably be botnet operators. It might be the case that the best option is to just stick with normal cryptographic hash functions, but be constantly prepared to hardfork to a different algorithm if the miners abuse their position.
It's mostly unrelated, but here's another concerning source of centralization that comes to mind: Did you know that BitcoinJ (which underlies most lightweight wallets) only ever connects to peers returned by 7 centralized servers? So if you can get control of one of these servers and DDoS the rest, and you can mine at least one block, then you can send whatever transactions you want (including transactions creating unlimited BTC from nothing) to almost any user of lightweight wallets, and they'll treat your transaction as valid.

Using mining as a method of triggering it is no good no matter what percentage.
The proper way to do a hardfork would be:
* Create a proposal that has no significant opposition. A proposal has significant opposition if it is strongly opposed by any of: one Bitcoin Core developer, one large exchange or company (Coinbase, etc.), a few generally-recognized Bitcoin experts, several smaller but still economically-important companies, or a large group of ordinary users who have reasonable arguments and are willing and able to exert some real economic force. This means that it's very difficult to do controversial hardforks. That's the point. You need to get consensus -- that is, make a hardfork *non-controversial* -- in order to do it.
* Put the change in the code set to take effect at some exact time 6-12 months in the future.
* Since the "flag day" is so far in the future, almost all of the *economy* will just naturally upgrade without any special effort. Since the change is non-controversial, no one of any economic significance will have reason to refuse to upgrade. The network will not split, since everyone will still have the same understanding of what Bitcoin is.

There are many options besides 8 MB and nothing... One of the more popular proposals among experts for eventually dynamically adjusting the max block size above 1 MB is "flex cap", which was invented by Greg Maxwell. And no one supports 1 MB forever: the max block size *will* go up eventually, just maybe not as soon or as much as some people want.


That's not true. Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladamir isn't a Blockstream employee. He works for MIT, same as Gavin. And even *if* Blockstream employees somehow "took over" development, anyone could fork the software. Bitcoin.org is independent and would probably list sane, mature, non-hardforking software forks of Core, especially if the Core developers started behaving badly.
My personal opinion on the max block size:
* The network [needs a large portion of the economy to be using full nodes or else it becomes absolutely insecure]( though the exact amount of the economy that needs to be backed by full nodes isn't known for sure.
* Larger blocks will prevent some people from running full nodes.
* Regrettably, there is no effective way for transaction volume to be limited by any sort of market mechanism in Bitcoin as it exists today, and I've only seen a few very underdeveloped proposals for improving this.
* Miners have strong economic incentives to put as many fee-paying transactions in blocks as possible, and more supply usually breeds more demand, so over time the average block size will tend toward the maximum possible value.
* Therefore, the only way to protect the network's decentralization is some sort of hard maximum. This maximum should be a best guess as to the maximum consistent block size that will not push "too many" full nodes off of the network.
* Because the number of full nodes has consistently been going *down*, I think that *any* increase right now will cause too many full nodes to be pushed out. Maybe some increase will look more reasonable in a year or so when Bitcoin Core has been made more efficient and typical Internet access has improved. (It might be *possible* to *survive* some of the increase proposals right now, but it'd be risky and difficult.)
* This is an issue of *supply*. It doesn't matter how much you *want* or *need* more transaction volume. It doesn't matter that blocks are sometimes full now. If the network can't safely handle the volume you want, then you just have to make do with what it can handle. There are many proposals such as Lightning to get around this limitation in clever, roundabout ways. Remember that Bitcoin is the most inefficient transaction system ever devised *in order to enable decentralization*, so it's never *directly* going to be as cheap/fast as VISA, and removing decentralization kills the main benefit of Bitcoin.

rpcssl is almost never used, so even after all of this time it's considered somewhat experimental. It's also considered extremely risky in general to expose Bitcoin's JSON-RPC to the public Internet by any means -- you should only do it if you really really need to, and only after a lot of testing. And since the developers want to remove the dependency on any sort of SSL library in the long run, rpcssl will probably be removed at some point.

IMO it's pretty likely that before mid 2017 either a hardfork will be scheduled (to activate 9-12 months later), or another capacity-increase softfork will be rolled out (to take effect gradually over the course of a few months). It's impossible to say for sure, though.

This is a point that's very often missed. In the original paper and again here, Satoshi talked about SPV as requiring what are now called fraud proofs. With fraud proofs, lightweight nodes are still able to enforce all of the rules of Bitcoin as long as they are able to receive messages from one honest full node. But what we now think of as "SPV nodes" lack these fraud proofs, instead trusting miners absolutely. (This redefinition was first made by Mike Hearn's BitcoinJ.) This is way less secure than Satoshi imagined, and the rise of these validation-less nodes is a major threat to Bitcoin as a whole (see [here]( and [here](
Satoshi might not have realized it, but it was previously impossible to do fraud proofs that cover all of the rules. But with SegWit, this will be possible, and I hope that fraud proofs are implemented soon after SegWit. Even if the number of full nodes was reduced by 90%, if all lightweight nodes became capable of processing fraud proofs, this'd probably still be a net gain in security for Bitcoin as a whole as well as for each of its users.

That's irrelevant. What if I released some software that said that block  hash must end in 0x00? This wouldn't have activated yet, and just by chance it might not actually fork, but it is *very likely* that anyone who runs such software would end up on a completely different and irreconcilable currency after the flag day. I'd consider it an altcoin, even if it is temporarily compatible with Bitcoin and the change itself is a softfork.
Although possible, it seems to me less than likely that BIP 148 will actually get enough economic support to succeed. If only a few percent of the economy enforces BIP 148, and miners do not enforce it, then anyone using a BIP148 client **will** end up on a totally separate and probably irreconcilable currency when BIP148 activates, very similar to a contentious flag-day hardfork.
At some level of economic support, BIP148-enforcing software should become more-or-less equal to Bitcoin, but I'm not sure where the line should be drawn... I'd like to at least be able to think that there's more than a 50% chance of it actually be successful, though.

Others have answered the original question. A question with a somewhat more surprising answer is, "If we worked really hard to generate *any* address more than once using different private keys (ie. a collision), how long would that take?" Because this is a birthday problem, the result is surprisingly low: only ~41 days on average if you could try 400 quadrillion addresses per second (comparing here to the network hashrate).
If you do similar calculations, you'll find that if Bitcoin becomes amazingly (but not *impossibly*) popular/widespread, then it wouldn't be *completely* out of the question for two people in Bitcoin's history to generate the same address.

1. A hardfork creates a totally separate currency. If the old currency is not completely abandoned, then it's called a contentious (or non-consensus) hardfork, and the two currencies will trade freely on the market like any two separate cryptocurrencies. The chaos of this situation would likely cause the sum of the two prices to be far lower than the original price of the combined currency, however. While "Classic" can correctly be viewed as an altcoin, the rules of the two currencies are close enough that for the moment all "Classic" transactions are compatible with Bitcoin transactions and vice-versa; you can't currently acquire ClassicCoins.
2. Satoshi hoped that fees would be sufficient to incentivize miners, but many experts think that the system-wide incentives aren't right for this to actually happen as Satoshi expected. Some possibilities are: miners motivated by altruism will provide sufficient security; users will add enough fees to incentivize sufficient security even though smaller fees would be enough to get transactions confirmed (maybe due to wallet defaults that people are too lazy to change); the safe max block size (determined by network-wide bandwidth, CPU, and disk speed/space capacity) will just happen to be low enough to create enough scarcity to promote enough fees to incentivize sufficient security; the max block size will be artificially limited (via something like flexcap, for example) to create enough scarcity to promote enough fees to incentivize sufficient security; miners will find other ways to sustain themselves, such as by engaging in contracts with businesses; businesses and individuals will choose to donate to miners using [assurance contracts](
3. A suitable proof-of-work needs to be: difficult to compute (but with a tunable difficulty), easy to verify, random, and decentralized. Protein folding fails all but the first. There's no known independently-useful thing that miners could be doing instead of their currently "useless" hashing work. However, securing the Bitcoin network *is* a useful activity, and is far less energy-intensive than the production and transport of paper money, for example.

They actually ask this question as part of their standard quiz. Kind of neat. Though it's not a very clear or interesting question. What does "legal currency" mean? Bitcoin is already legal in the US. I guess maybe they mean consider it like a foreign currency for tax purposes, though this is kind of a small detail, and probably it's far too favorable to Bitcoiners for it to ever happen.
BTW, I took the president poll there and I got 97% agreement with the Libertarian party as expected, but 88% agreement with Ted Cruz, which seems like a massively overinflated number, since Cruz is very obviously not ~88% Libertarian...

What happened in a few hours was a softfork to ensure that the original rules were enforced. Months later (using a flag-day trigger, not a stupid miner supermajority trigger), a hardfork was done to restore the expected behavior. This hardfork was easier than pretty much any hardfork that one might want to do today because:
* It had unanimous agreement from everyone.
* A decent chunk of people were already enforcing only the new rules due to the "accidental hardfork" earlier.
* Old nodes could "upgrade" by just creating a single file in their data directory. A full software upgrade wasn't necessary.
* Old nodes that didn't do anything would reject the new chain only randomly. They wouldn't all fork at the same time.
Even so, this was a pretty disruptive event...
(Also, some people don't consider this to be a real hardfork because old nodes weren't following any deterministic rules when rejecting too-large blocks. They were basically just randomly failing, with larger blocks making this failure much more likely.)

Why is there a need for *any* token? You could create a (very basic and unstable) Youtube alternative in a few days: just do it if you want. If you want to add support for patreon-style supporters, paid content, or sending tips, you could:
 * Use BTC site balances.
 * Collect a master public key from each uploader, derive keys from each prospective payer, and monitor when on-chain BTC payments are sent. That way you can gate content and track payments without actually touching any BTC. (But on-chain micropayments don't scale, and LN probably can't trustlessly be used for this because uploaders would have to be online to accept payments.)
 * Create/use a BTC-denominated sidechain.
 * Use my idea [here](
Making a decentralized version is much more complicated. For video storage, it can definitely be done via Freenet. For streaming, you might also be able to use Freenet by having streamers upload ~5-second-long stream fragments as SSK versions, though you'd have to try it and see if you get acceptable latency. If you further want to monetize it for publishers, then it'd get a lot more difficult and require a lot more thought, but throwing "blockchain!" at it and calling it a day will not lead to anything actually useful. You'd have to ask questions like: Is a new token actually necessary (note: almost certainly not)? Are you building your whole model around the baseless assumption that your token is going to increase in price? Does creating a *company* for your idea actually add anything to the goal of creating a decentralized thing, or does it just create a conflict of interest and get in the way? Who's going to pay for content and why? If someone buys *information*, how do you prevent them from sharing it with other people? If money is made via advertising, how is something decentralized going to find advertisers and distribute revenue? Etc.


It's not impossible that they could succeed *as a centralized service*, but starting out on a foundation of deception and empty hype makes it less likely IMO.


This is the first I'm hearing of Dtube. After 5 minutes of investigation, it seems much more technically interesting than D-Live, and actually somewhat decentralized. Though IPFS is primitive and worse than Freenet in almost every way.


Decentralized products are much more difficult to build, and much more difficult for end-users to use, which is why they're not very common. It seems that in order for a decentralized product to out-compete centralized versions, the existing centralized solutions need to be fundamentally difficult to operate in a manner that people consider ideal (somewhat true in YT's case due to costs and copyright/legal issues, though maybe not enough), *and* the decentralized product needs to be designed with an incredible amount of thought and care.

Bitcoin is about individual sovereignty, not rule by a majority of miners, nodes, users, bitcoins, or whatever. If you use a full node, then you will absolutely reject **no matter what** any blocks or transactions that create too many bitcoins, or spend bitcoins without a valid signature, or double-spend outputs, or exceed the limits. This extreme resistance to change within the core rules is Bitcoin's primary advantage over all other money, and the only reason bitcoins have any value at all is because people can rely on these core rules not to be changeable by some external force.
If you want a currency backed by democracy, there are a number of democratic countries with currencies you can use.
As for using transactions as a rough measure of *adoption*: it might be slightly useful, but it strikes me as representing only a small portion of the economy. Also, miners can censor transactions. It might be better to add this sort of rough version and capability polling to the payment protocol, and then ask merchants to publish their statistics.

If you want to make money on speculation, the  rule is: buy **low**, sell **high**. Even very experienced speculators forget this rule sometimes and lose money. If you buy in reaction to excitement, when the price is unusually high, then you are far more likely to lose money in the short term. In the long-term you might still make money: If you think that Bitcoin is heading back up to a new steady high for a long time, then buying now might be a good decision. But keep in mind that in general you should try to buy during very low/pessimistic periods and sell during very high/optimistic periods if you want to make money from short-term price changes.
If you just want to expand your Bitcoin position and you don't care too much about short-term prices (this is appropriate for most people, I think), then it's a good idea to convert a fixed amount of fiat into BTC every week or whatever. Then the exact prices have less effect on you.

The smallest possible transaction is 60 bytes, and blocks have 83 bytes of data besides transactions, so theoretically a 1 MB block can store up to 16665 transactions. A more realistic small transaction will have one input and two outputs, all dealing with version-1 addresses, and that sort of transaction is 225 bytes. A 1 MB block can store up to 4444 such transactions.
If you're asking how large the max block size could actually be: I think that the current network might start to fall apart at persistent block sizes as low as 4-8 MB due to large block propagation latency. This could possibly be solved by adding more explicit centralization, such as by restructuring the network into a supernode layout. In general, increasing the average block size adds significant centralization pressure: For large block sizes this is necessary for the network to even function at all, but even small block size increases make it significantly more difficult and expensive to run a full node, which makes people want to do anything to avoid running a full node.
Centralization is not a yes/no thing. It'd probably be possible to have 1 GB blocks if there were only a dozen full nodes, so in a sense Bitcoin could "sustain" that volume, but that degree of centralization would be totally against the spirit of Bitcoin.

SegWit basically *is* an extension block softfork. That's how it increases capacity. Doing an extension block softfork that is somehow separate from SegWit (as implied by the table in the article, but not really by the proposal it links) makes zero sense.
I recently wrote a [long post on extension blocks]( It's not a bad idea, but it has drawbacks. The draft proposal linked in this article is of the sidechain-like variety. The general idea is that your Bitcoin wallet would show two accounts which can be thought of as a "savings" account (Bitcoin as it exists now) and a "checking" account (which will be a reduced-decentralization=reduced-security sidechain-like thing). You can move between the two accounts for an on-chain fee on both. Sending from your checking account to someone else's checking account will be cheaper. If the extension chain dies or becomes horribly centralized, you may lose the BTC in your checking account, but your savings balance will be unaffected. This general idea is very reasonable, and one which I've been advocating for a long time, since it provides the best of both worlds. (You can do this two-account system in several different ways: extension blocks, proper sidechains, blinded bearer certificates, hub-and-spoke systems, etc.)
As with any sidechain-like extension block proposal, you have to ask: Why not add complete support for sidechains? This proposal is like doing just one special case of sidechains, when adding complete sidechain support wouldn't be a major additional leap. (But this isn't a major issue IMO.) This particular proposal also modifies SegWit in a way which is probably not going to be acceptable. (And there may be other issues -- I only briefly looked through it.) But the general idea isn't a bad one.
If the idea is for the extension blocks to be more than a few MB in size, then it'd probably be better to do something like [federated sidechains]( or [blinded bearer certificates]( or even [my miner-controlled semi-joke scheme]( instead. Otherwise you're going to get the worst of all worlds: extension block verification is going to end up centralized to miners and maybe a few big players, but you won't get instant confirmations, increased anonymity, or super-high capacity in return for the centralization. (Due to latency and perhaps a desire to create fee pressure, miners probably aren't going to want to create blocks more than tens of MB in size. But federated sidechains or blinded bearer certificates could handle basically unlimited transaction volume without much trouble.)

If the full-node-backed economy verifies only the 1MB blocks, but nobody but miners verifies the extblocks, then the extblocks are very similar to an SPV-security sidechain. If miners do something invalid on the extblocks, the economy will just accept it. There won't be anyone (of economic significance) who will hard-reject invalid extblocks. This is consistent and reasonably OK, but it means that you definitely don't want to put much value on the extblocks at any one time, since miners might just decide to steal it.
If essentially all of the full-node-backed economy verifies both the 1MB blocks and the extblocks, then the extblocks are just an extension of the 1MB blocks. Balances on extblocks would be just as secure as normal once ~all of the economy has upgraded and is enforcing rules on the extblocks. This is the traditional extblocks idea; it's consistent and OK. However, this isn't going to happen if extblocks are 100MB, and in fact probably not even if they are 2MB.
If 25-75% of the full-node-backed economy verifies both 1MB blocks and extblocks, and 25-75% of the full-node-backed economy verifies only 1MB blocks, then there is a serious risk of a currency fork. If miners produce an invalid extblock, part of the economy will hard-reject that chain forever, while part of the economy will consider it valid. Miners might scramble to fix this, resulting in a long reorg (which can lead to losses due to double-spends), or the fork might permanently split Bitcoin. This is inconsistent and dangerous.
I think that this particular proposal will follow the first paragraph above once its backers realize the risk in the above paragraph, especially since the people who seem to be driving this proposal like to believe that miners should be absolutely trusted anyway.

Agreed. Once it's quite certain that ECDSA will be dangerously broken in *x* years, a timer should be started to make ECDSA-secured UTXOs unspendable in *x* years. The goal of this would be to preserve the following core property of Bitcoin: "Over time, people will lose bitcoins, which will become unspendable. Therefore, Bitcoin will have monetary deflation in the long-term." If a few UTXOs get broken, that's survivable, but having millions of lost BTC become unlost would be an economic disaster.
(For those who don't know: mining traditionally sent the reward BTC directly to a public key, not to an address. So there's millions of very-likely-lost bitcoins that could be recovered by a quantum computer.)
That heuristic would be nice, but it will probably be difficult to do an exact enough calculation for that. The most important thing will be to give as many years of warning time as possible, so it'll probably be difficult to estimate attack costs so far in advance.
Destroying UTXOs in this way is a softfork, not a hardfork. It should be fairly simple and straightforward, and hopefully not controversial once this becomes an actual threat. It's entirely possible that this will take 30+ years to actually become a threat, though. QC development hasn't been moving at all quickly. It might even be the case that sufficiently-large quantum computers are simply impractical to build.

No, it's somewhere between 2x and 3x more. It depends on the distribution of transactions; some transaction types get more "savings" under SegWit than others. Last I heard, the current distribution is around 2.2x throughput, but this changes over time; when SegWit was first being proposed, the transaction distribution suggested ~1.7x throughput.
In the worst case (ie. largest blocks, highest throughput), blocks can be ~4x larger, but this would be caused by weird transactions which we wouldn't normally see. Some people have incorrectly interpreted this fact to mean that SegWit is horribly inefficient, getting 2x more throughput with 4x more space, but that's totally wrong: *if* a block is 4x larger under SegWit, then it would've taken ~4 pre-SegWit blocks to fit those transactions. It's just that the 4x larger case won't normally happen, so you can't say that SegWit *normally* gets 4x more throughput.

If you did it right now in the naïve way, then people would just run one node connected to the Internet via thousands of IP addresses to get a lot of the reward. (Also, it's not clear how you would coordinate/enforce this reward, since the state of the entire network isn't global or in the block chain.)
Possibly you could incentivize *capacity* by having nodes pay each other micropayments for providing services. So if you download a block or a transaction from someone, you pay them a tiny amount. Or maybe if you're accepting a *new* block, you should be paid by the miner who created it for helping to propagate it. Stuff like that. That'd incentivize people to add more capacity to the network. Maybe running a full node would get you a small amount of BTC, though running a lightweight node would cost BTC over time.
But the above wouldn't solve the real issue: decentralization. The network has plenty of capacity already. The real problem is that if not enough of the *economy* is backed by independent full nodes, then Bitcoin is totally insecure for everyone (see [here]( and [here]( And you can't really pay people to *actually use their own full node for their own real transactions*.

"Emergent consensus" doesn't have clear meaning. First of all, it uses the [ambiguous/loaded word "consensus"]( so it is immediately ambiguous. But if I think about what "emergent consensus" should mean, I think of a system where users would decide their own hard rules, and then the currency would be allowed to shatter into many pieces as a result of these differing rules and then hopefully reform into a small number of pieces due to market forces. This is very different from how Bitcoin works now, but it's an interesting idea, and maybe it could work in some cases. I myself have presented two different ideas that work in this way: [coordinated user-enforced dynamic scaling limits]( and [arbchains]( But this is *not* how BU works. BU just lets miners do whatever they want.
UASFs should be done with the goal of maintaining one universal set of "consensus rules", which is how Bitcoin has always historically operated. This is different from my idea of emergent consensus above. And it's different from BU's idea of emergent consensus because it rejects the idea that miners should rule Bitcoin.
But if a UASF is done with a high probability of splitting the currency due to a combination of minority miner support and non-overwhelming economic support, then it is in fact similar to my description of emergent consensus.

How all of these prices work is that you have people on exchanges with open offers saying "I'll buy 1 BTC for $1295" or "I'll sell 1 BTC for $1305". Anyone with the necessary fiat/BTC can fill any of these open offers. The Bitcoin price on a certain exchange is (usually) defined as the price of the most recent open offer that was filled on that exchange.
Assume that the euro loses 10% of its value tomorrow, but the prices of EUR&lt;-&gt;BTC offers on exchanges remain the same. Then you could make money by selling EUR for BTC, buying USD with your BTC, converting to EUR at a bank or whatever at the new 10%-reduced rate, and repeating. But by doing so, you would consume all of the BTC being offered by people with these sub-optimal trades. If they kept offering sub-optimal trades, they would eventually run out of money. As a result, the supply of BTC in the EUR market would drop, and the price of BTC relative to EUR would rise until this sort of trading was no longer profitable; this point would be when the value of EUR relative to BTC had dropped by about 10%. This sort of trading is called *arbitrage*, and it ensures that all markets which trade a certain thing have roughly the same price for it (assuming the movement of that thing is not severely restricted).

That's how softforks work in general. SegWit, CLTV, and all other softforks disallow something that was previously allowed. In SegWit's case, certain anyone-can-spend transactions are no longer allowed to be spent by anyone. So old nodes end up only enforcing a subset of the new rules. Old nodes still enforce all of the other rules, so this isn't much of a problem.

Even now, a lot of people are saying that miners are in charge of deciding hardforks. They're not. 75% or 95%, it doesn't matter. If Bitcoin is ruled by a handful of miners, then Bitcoin is deeply broken. What really matters is what the economy (which should be backed by independent full nodes) does. Full nodes enforce the rules *no matter what*, even if *all* miners break them. Bitcoin is about individual sovereignty, not rule by a majority of miners or nodes or whatever.
If you want to, you should be free to enforce the current rules of Bitcoin forever. And full nodes will do so. The only way that anyone should be "forced" to upgrade is by economic pressure: you want to transact with someone, but you can't with your current rules. (And actually even this sort of coercion is sub-optimal, but it can't be avoided.)
More people should use full nodes for their own personal transactions, and businesses in particular shouldn't be relying on third-party APIs. If everyone was using full nodes, then these sorts of attacks would be far more difficult because everyone would have to make the conscious decision to "upgrade". The current political attacks are largely founded on exploiting the extremely disappointing fact that there are some big single-points-of-failure in the current Bitcoin ecosystem: miners (who can trick some lightweight nodes into following them), Bitcoin-payment-API providers, etc.
SegWit will allow for future implementation of fraud proofs, which will let lightweight nodes reject invalid chains just like full nodes (but without 100% reliability). That'll be a great improvement to Bitcoin's resistance to attack.

Something like [TXO commitments]( an ultimate solution to UTXO bloat &amp; ever-expanding initial-sync time. This'd be a huge change, though, and there isn't even a widely-agreed-upon proposal yet, so it's probably 4+ years away.
Also, this can be done today without any changes to Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin developers aren't working on this, but I'd like to see someone issue BTC blinded bearer certificates backed by a multisig "bank".

Maybe in the short-term there will be some problems until the technology becomes better-developed, but I'm not very worried about capacity in the long-term.
There is absolutely no way that even a noticeable percentage of world transactions will be on-chain. It's simply impossible. Though in general, the max block size should be as large as safely possible. That's why the scaling roadmap calls for an effective increase to ~2 MB this spring, and probably later increases to 4-8 MB after IBLT and/or weak blocks (planned for late this year). These increases are likely to be more than sufficient in the near-term. But if they're not and the max block size is at the maximum safe size, then we shouldn't abandon the decentralization, security, etc. of the base Bitcoin system in order to achieve lower fees. We should instead look for some other solution.
The most promising solution (which is very desirable regardless of current demand/capacity) is of course Lightning, which will move almost all transactions off-chain but with basically the same level of security and decentralization as Bitcoin.
If Lightning is too slow too develop, or doesn't work as well as expected, or doesn't provide enough capacity, one avenue for solutions would to increase centralization at higher levels. Lightning has basically the same level of decentralization and security as Bitcoin itself, but you can increase centralization to improve efficiency. For example, a hub-and-spoke payment channel network would probably significantly reduce the number of channel-create transactions each person would have to do, since each person would probably rely on only one hub. (Lightning on the other hand doesn't have any hubs.) If even that is too much, we can do blinded bearer certificates; in combination with multisig and other Bitcoin smart contracts, this can be sufficiently secure for everyday usage, and certainly far more secure and transparent than the traditional banking system, *as long as the core Bitcoin network is secure*. And everyone would still have the option of using the lower-level system for more high-security things.
Another avenue for solutions would be more cleverness. For example:
* Implementing IBLT and/or weak blocks would probably allow twice-larger (or more) safe max block sizes.
* It might be reasonably safe to distribute verification so that each node only verifies 1% of transactions or something and produces a fraud proof informing the rest of the network when any inconsistency is found. (SegWit will make this possible - it's not possible now.) This reduces the system's security, but maybe by only an acceptable very small amount.
* I think that it might be possible to do multiple layers of something like Lightning.
IMO probably only Lightning and IBLT / weak blocks will be necessary, but if not, the above trade-offs can be made. I very much believe that Bitcoin can eventually become both the most secure currency on Earth as well as the most popular currency on Earth.

Bitcoin nodes just check that a transaction is in the longest chain of a sidechain. As I understand it, the Sidechain-&gt;Bitcoin transaction contains a list of block headers on the sidechain (not all headers are necessary, so the transaction can be reasonably small) and the Merkle branch attaching the sidechain transaction to the latest provided header. Then there is a waiting period in which anyone can cancel this transaction by providing a fraud proof: headers for a longer sidechain chain containing a transaction conflicting with the original transaction
Therefore, everyone using a sidechain has only SPV-level security. The miners of a sidechain can steal everyone's money on the sidechain if they want. So IMO decentralized sidechains will only be useful for low-value things like microtransactions and testing. (Though the sidechains people disagree with me on this.)

Yes, they're mostly fake. You can also see this clearly on the second graph on this page:  . These nodes are like 75% new IPs and 25% old XT/Unlimited nodes.

Bitcoin Core doesn't create RBF transactions yet, it only includes the network-level code for handling them and some support for identifying them when they are received. (It wouldn't make much sense to create them now, since support for RBF transactions is just now being rolled out.)
You could create one by creating a transaction with `createrawtransaction`, modifying the hex by hand to reduce one of the input sequence numbers to less than 0xffffffff - 1 (this is the opt-in indicator), double-checking it with `decoderawtransaction`, signing it with `signrawtransaction`, and then sending it with `sendrawtransaction`.

The bitcoins are not seized, they're destroyed. *Redistributing* lost bitcoins is a [prohibited change]( (I created the linked wiki page 3 years ago after having a little debate with gmaxwell about this very issue.)
Bitcoin developers can't do anything like this single-handedly. It takes economic support. (If just miners do it, without economic support, then the economy could change the PoW algorithm.)


Agreed. Destroying the UTXOs is clearly not intended to protect the owners of those coins. But this theft issue is also the problem of other Bitcoin users who joined Bitcoin with the expectation that lost bitcoins will *stay* lost. It's a systemic security issue, not just an issue per-user. There's very little potential for harm in destroying UTXOs that will soon be stolen anyway, but not doing so will certainly severely harm the economy.

Seems like FUD.
Firstly, BGP attacks are just an alternative *way* of doing other, known attacks. If you're isolating a single node via BGP, then that's roughly the same as if you compromised the target's ISP and are acting as a man-in-the-middle. If you partition part of the network, then that's like cutting important backbone cables. You might as well say, "Bitcoin is weak to scissors (for cutting lines)!".
Secondly, these possible attacks are well-explored (mainly in the non-BGP equivalents mentioned above), and are not huge issues. I mentioned both attacks in the very first version of the [Weaknesses]( wiki page that I wrote in 2010.
Partitioning the network is something that Bitcoin is especially resistant to, since if even a *single* node in the partitioned group is multi-homed and able to reach the rest of the world, then the Bitcoin network is very efficient at spreading that node's information through the partitioned group -- even a single, modest multi-homed node can act as an effective gateway for potentially hundreds of thousands of partitioned Bitcoin users. And Bitcoin Core comes with support for a form of multi-homing in its usage of Tor hidden services. Instructions for making your node into a dual clearnet+hidden-service node are [here](
The delay attack (which might not even work as they described, I'm not sure) is just a normal DoS attack against most nodes. It'd only *really* harm miners, but there are **no** substantial miners who rely purely on the Bitcoin P2P network. All large miners are members of both the Bitcoin P2P network and the FIBRE high-efficiency relay network, for example. Many miners are truly multi-homed, and may additionally support Tor connections. Most miners have several nodes on different IPs, and keep those IPs secret to avoid DDoS attacks. Etc. So the attack is implausible.
BIP 150/151 (peer authentication/encryption) will further improve defenses against man-in-the-middle attacks, including BGP-based ones.
@_date: 2016-02-10 15:08:30
The risk is that miners could break the rules introduced by CLTV and old nodes wouldn't reject their blocks. Then either the network would split long-term into two pieces (unlikely, but very bad), or more likely the miners would quit it after a few blocks, and some transactions would lose many confirmations. Probably it's fairly safe not to adopt an active softfork if you then consider confirmations to be worth a lot less than otherwise. But unless you actually disagree with a softfork and don't want to enforce it, it's better for you and Bitcoin to just upgrade.
This is still far safer and easier than a hardfork, though.

From that screenshot, there wasn't much liquidity on the buying side either. The screenshot shows that you'd need 111 BTC to drop the price by $200 or the equivalent of 58 BTC to raise the price by $200. Whereas right now on Bitstamp, for example, the same thing is 750BTC/900BTC.

This is old news. The NSA made this announcement in August. The announcement makes very little sense. SHA-256 is strongly believed to be safe even in the face of QC, but yet they suggest replacing it with SHA-384. And their suggested larger-keysize asymmetric crypto is *not* QC-resistant. Cryptographers Neal Koblitz and Alfred J. Menezes even published an [entire paper]( speculating on WTF the NSA is doing here.
Note that Greg Maxwell discovered that the P-x series of ECDSA curves, recommended here by the NSA, are probably backdoored by the NSA...
ECDSA is known to be entirely broken if a sufficiently large quantum computer is created, but it seems that no one is anywhere near doing this. And Bitcoin has some innate protection here because you can't attack ECDSA without knowing someone's public key, and if you don't reuse addresses (as has always been strongly recommended), then there is only ever a very small window of time in which anyone knows and can attack your public key.
QC-resistant crypto can be added to Bitcoin easily with a softfork. AFAIK, the current plan is to use [Lamport signatures]( probably modified for key reuse and smaller public keys. QC doesn't look like a realistic threat right now, so there's been no rush to complete this. Also, all common QC-resistant crypto produces *way* larger signatures (several kB), which should probably be avoided as long as safely possible.

My understanding is that it's expected for Lightning's network graph to not be especially centralized because the larger a supernode/hub gets, the more BTC it has to tie up in channels, and for not all that much in fees.

That's not an exhaustive list of necessary PoW properties, just the ones that came to mind.
I'm not sure that that sort of dependency on older blocks is actually necessary, though. You need to somehow prove that the PoW is tied to your block without allowing others to steal your PoW, but assuming that you could independently generate "PoW tokens" and then securely attach them to a block that would itself contain a prev-block pointer, I don't see the harm in it.

It's how much each byte of a transaction's witness is discounted when considering the max block size limit. So with a 75% discount (sipa's original proposal), a 200-byte transaction composed of 150 bytes of witness data and 50 bytes of non-witness data would count as (150-75%)+50 = 88 bytes toward the current 1 MB max block size.
A discount is warranted because witness data is far less expensive to the network overall, though at least for new transactions all witness data still needs to be downloaded by all full nodes. So discounts of 0% or 100% don't make sense.
@_date: 2016-02-20 20:38:02
Keep in mind that the Core devs at the meeting were only speaking for themselves, and Core *cannot* promise a hardfork. A hardfork requires consensus among the *economy*.
However, I do think that the plan is reasonable. BlueMatt's idea (which is I guess what they're talking about here) is that SegWit will provide via softfork an effective max block size between 1 and 4 MB with an expected max-volume usage of ~1.8 MB, and then the hardfork will adjust the SegWit discount while at the same time raising MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to 2 MB to give an effective max block size between 2 and 3 MB with an expected max-volume usage of ~2.1 MB. It's basically just a navel-gazing hardfork, and it should therefore be fairly uncontroversial. The timeline presented here is somewhat optimistic, though. Also, the SegWit discount has real meaning, and you can't just replace it with any number, though I'm not sure that there's a big difference between sipa's original 75% and BlueMatt's proposed 50%.

Pruning will be in 0.12 (to be released next week, probably).
The fifth item in my list is pretty well-developed and uncontroversial, so that could happen not too far into the future. Maybe even as soon as 0.14 or 0.15.
UTXO commitment could likewise happen at any time, though it'll take someone very skilled and dedicated to champion it. A few things still need to be worked out. It could happen this year or it could happen in 5 years - it all depends on whether someone will be willing to work on it or not.
The last item in my list is a pretty new and underdeveloped idea which probably won't happen for many years unless UTXO bloat actually becomes a pressing problem.


The limiting factor for max block size is bandwidth and CPU, not storage. There aren't as many good ideas for solving bandwidth and CPU. IBLT and weak blocks are probably the best ideas for improving the issue directly, but there are problems with these, and they aren't a cure-all. The two main competing long-term ideas for bandwidth are:
* Just require that all full nodes have a ton of bandwidth. But most experts believe that this would make Bitcoin too centralized to be safe (see [here]( and [here](
* Do almost all transactions off of the Bitcoin network, using Bitcoin only as the final global settlement layer. The observation here is that a $5 transaction between you and someone who's standing right next to you should usually not need to be downloaded and verified by everyone in the world and notarized by the most powerful computing system in human history. But making transaction verification more localized in a way that is secure and decentralized is difficult and complex. Lightning is one promising attempt at it.
A third alternative might be to somehow make it so that full nodes only download and verify a subset of all transactions, but this is very different from the current network, and it's not clear how to do it securely. There are no proposals for doing this in the near term.

That certainly wasn't Wei Dai's goal. He was aiming for decentralization and freedom, same as Satoshi. Progress doesn't happen all at once, and Bitcoin was built off of imperfect ideas such as this.

B-money doesn't use block chains at all.
I'm not sure how "permissioned blockchains" are actually supposed to work... I think that it's more of a meaningless buzzword than anything.

You're ignoring the UTXO-set growth problem, which is one of the main blockers to increased max block sizes. SegWit increases capacity without increasing the UTXO-set growth rate at all.
If this is fixed (such as with TXO commitments), then a modest max-block-size increase via extension blocks as you suggest could be reasonable. But if they're going to try to create 2+MB extblocks without fixing the UTXO issue, nobody's going to want to fully validate the extblocks, so you'll end up with a reduced-security incarnation of BTC requiring separate accounts.

First, blocks can already be 2MB (or larger) due to SegWit.
If you double the maximum tx throughput, then you double the amount that has to be spent every &lt;time_period&gt; in order to keep the fee high. If for example an attacker is trying to keep the fee at $10/kB and is currently spending $100k per hour in order to do so, then doubling the transaction throughput would require him to either double his spending to $200k *per hour* or else halve his target fee to $5/kB. These are not negligible effects: both add up quick. (And it functions the same with high fees due to real market forces rather than an attacker.) It's true that there's essentially an unlimited demand for $0/kB transactions, but there's much less demand for $0.10/kB transactions, and even less for $1/kB transactions, etc. There's a limit on just how much Veriblock can spend per hour in total, and the more transaction throughput this is spread out among, the lower the network-wide fee that results.
When considered alone, higher transaction throughput is good. It allows for additional use-cases and more useful economic activity. Striving for high fees as a goal unto itself is nonsensical. As such, the max block size should be **as large as *safely* possible**, where "safety" includes factors like decentralization and possibly mining incentives. If the max block size was 100kB, then this would be far below what is necessary for safety, and it would be correct to increase it. When Luke-Jr argues (mostly alone) that the current max block size is too high, even he does this from the perspective of *safety*, not because he really likes the idea of $20/tx fees. You could argue that it would be safe to increase the max block size from its current value, but such arguments should be entirely from the point of view of *safety*, and "fees are too high" should never be part of the argument. If airplane tickets are too expensive, you acknowledge this as the market's natural reaction to a limited resource: you don't take down the "max capacity" sign to fit more people. But you also don't need to fill up only half of the plane at double the ticket price just for the hell of it, which is sort of the vibe I get from this post.

* It destroys your privacy and seriously hurts the privacy of *everyone you transact with*, so it's considered courteous to not reuse addresses if at all possible.
* If ECDSA is broken, Bitcoin can remain reasonably secure if you don't reuse addresses. ECDSA and most other public-key crypto is *known* to be completely broken against sufficiently large quantum computers, which are generally believed to be possible and not too far away, so it's prudent to not stake everything on ECDSA. (In the absence of address reuse, Bitcoin can claim to be QC-resistant.)
* ECDSA is more "fragile". Frequently, particular (bad) implementations of ECDSA turn out to be completely broken, allowing anyone to steal your bitcoins if they're stored in an address that has ever before "sent" bitcoins.
* Address reuse is considered to be an accidental "feature" that isn't *really* supported by the developers.
* There are several proposals for different address types that offer additional features or security but are incompatible with address reuse. So it's best to get used to not reusing addresses now.
However, there are some rare cases where it's currently *far* more convenient to use a few unchanging addresses. The biggest example is when you want to do transparent accounting. Despite the misleading info given by most block explorers, it's generally not the case that an address is equal to an account. (That is, an address's sent transactions might not actually be meaningful, related to its receipts, or even made by the person who receives money at that address.) But it's easy enough to arrange things so that one or more your addresses *do* behave like accounts, and then you can use those addresses plus block explorer sites as an easy way of providing convincing (though not conclusive) public transaction records. You *could* use a hierarchical deterministic wallet and publish the master public key, but this has the same privacy problems as address reuse, and the technology for HD wallets isn't that well-developed yet, so I don't think that it's worthwhile. Ideally there should be some way of proving certain facts about your BTC holdings/transactions without giving away everything about the actual transactions, but this technology doesn't exist yet AFAIK.
Another case where it's especially convenient to reuse addresses is when you want to receive regular payments from the same source or you want to accept anonymous donations. These cases should ideally be handled by giving a master public key to the sender, but again, HD wallets aren't sufficiently well-developed or standardized to make this comfortable in many cases.
In these few cases, I think it's acceptable to reuse addresses for the time being. But when someone is just asking you for a one-time payment address, you really should generate a new one each time. You should also generate new addresses on EWallets like Coinbase whenever depositing. (I've noticed that many of them only give you new addresses if you explicitly request it, which is stupid.)

He was modeling it after gold. If you traveled back in time, you'd be able to find a lot of gold near the Earth's surface, but assuming you were competing with other time-travelers, as the easy gold was mined, it'd become more and more difficult to get more. The desire to avoid monetary inflation was apparently a reaction to the clear failings of fiat currency; here's Satoshi (my emphasis):


Though actually (maybe not quite intentionally), Bitcoin will be far less inflationary than gold long-term. If gold increased in price 100x, people would start mining it from much deeper in the earth, on asteroids, maybe even creating it via nuclear transmutation, etc. None of this is possible with Bitcoin. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work, but such a deflationary currency has never been tried before. We'll have to see how it works over the course of the next few decades.
I think that it would work to keep the subsidy constant (resulting in a slowly decreasing rate of monetary inflation) or to have a schedule which always maintains a small but constant monetary inflation percentage (resulting in a slowly increasing subsidy). The important thing IMO is that the schedule be predictable and unchangeable. Bitcoin's highly-deflationary schedule has some advantages compared to other options (eg. it makes BTC an attractive investment vehicle in itself, spurring adoption), and disadvantages (eg. maybe it's harmful to encourage holding money rather than "real" assets), but it's not clear to me what the *ideal* schedule would be. Economists could probably write whole books about the matter. But it's not negotiable for Bitcoin: anything without Bitcoin's current inflation schedule is **not** Bitcoin.

Figure out which files/directories don't exist. You need to run that command in the same directory as the directory that you untarred. Also, some distros use /usr/bin instead of /usr/local/bin.
Edit: Also, that complicated `install` command just does three simple operations:
* It copies everything in the "bin" directory of the untarred release to /usr/local/bin (on some distros /usr/bin should be used instead).
* It changes the ownership of the destination files to root:root.
* It changes the permissions of the destination files to 755 (rwxr-xr-x).
The latter two steps will *probably* happen anyway if you just copy the files with `cp` or via your file manager while root. So maybe just try that.

What do you mean by "same method"?
In order to create a competing Internet, you need an actual physical means of communication between nodes via cable, radio, laser, etc. That's the hard part. You can't just give everyone a box that magically does this, since someone living in the middle of nowhere would have no obvious connection to any other nodes, and certain populations (on islands, for example) would be likely to end up segregated. There are some experimental decentralized Internet systems using mainly wifi (these are called "mesh networks"), but so far they've only had minor success, and they really only work in densely-populated cities due to wifi range limitations. I think that more widespread coverage requires at least some architectural planning -- for example, if you're on an island, you have to realize that *somebody* is going to have to set up some long-distance laser/satellite/cable connection in order to connect the island to the rest of the world, and then you have to make sure that this actually happens.

I think that the requirement of depending on the previous block is just a way to get random numbers in a decentralized way without the solver being able to choose the "random" numbers that he's working with. If you had some other way of generating random numbers in a decentralized way, then I think that the dependence on previous blocks isn't necessary. If the numbers are truly random, then the chance of reusing old work is very low. While I don't know how to do so, it's not clear to me that it's impossible to generate random numbers in a decentralized way without using a block chain.
For example, assuming the existence of some way to decentrally generate random RSA public keys of variable sizes according to the difficulty, a PoW could be to factor the public key. When you've factored it, you use the private key to sign a hash of the rest of your block, which would include its own prev-block pointer. I don't see a problem with this design.

Yes, you just have to find the right exchange.


Naturally. Fixing a cryptocurrency to a fiat currency requires centralization.


There'll be less BTC on the order book.
Take a look at [BitStamp's order book]( There are different order books for each currency; on BitStamp you can select the one you want using the dropdown on the far top left. Each row on each table was an order created by someone, waiting to be filled. Whenever a bid's price meets an ask's price, the order is actually executed, BTC from one person's account is traded with USD in the other person's account, and the orders are deleted if completely filled (or left up with a reduced amount only partially filled). The current Bitcoin price is the price of the most recent order that was executed.
"Asks" are people selling BTC. Imagine that someone bought a lot of BTC so that they could do the arbitrage trading I mentioned in my example. Then a big chunk of the top of that table would be wiped out. But notice that the price increases as you go down. At a small-scale technical level, this is why reducing the total amount of BTC on the ask side of the order book increases the price.
My example was sort of hypothetical/unrealistic because in reality only a small amount of real arbitrage trading happens before traders get wise to the price adjustment and replace their old orders with new ones factoring in the price change. The supply would only actually drop significantly if someone was stupid enough to keep trading at the old prices despite evidence of the new prices. In all markets, a lot of price changes happen because people *expect* something to happen, rather than something actually happening.

I consider the idea of sidechains to include the idea of a sidechain that *is* verified by full nodes, in addition to the more standard federated and SPV sidechain ideas.
The difference between a sidechain verified by all Bitcoin full nodes and an extension block is IMO that the sidechain will:
* Use a standard sidechain protocol, and will not touch Bitcoin-protocol-proper (such as by messing with SegWit).
* Be able to start as a federated or SPV sidechain and then be *upgraded* to Bitcoin-level security in a Bitcoin softfork.
* Could do things other than just creating larger blocks.

Even if 90% of all miners and users decide that there should be 200 BTC generated per block, the minority will just ignore them. This is unlike democracy, where the minority would be forced to accept the majority's decision. If most Bitcoin services upgrade, the minority would be *strongly incentivized* to also upgrade, but they wouldn't be forced. (I would never accept a change in the subsidy.)
The BIP 16 coinbase flag was meant to indicate when BIP 16 validation code could be safely added to clients without risking any "turbulence". If 75% of miners had "voted" for BIP 17, BIP 17 likely still wouldn't have been implemented because Gavin didn't like it.
At the time of the BIP 16 debate, I suggested taking the less safe route of ignoring miners entirely and just putting the verification code in a new bitcoin.org client release. Then all miners would have been forced to apply the changes in order to remain compatible with the bitcoin.org client.

[Here's how you write it]( (there's also a video on the left side of that page). IMO it's not very difficult.
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:44:31


This is not a common argument. Miners have plenty of incentive now. That's why experts aren't worried about the impending subsidy decrease. Bitcoin would be fine with half or a quarter as much mining power as now. Mining rewards won't be a major issue to worry about for at least 4 years.
When experts talk about fees in reference to the current block size issue, I think what they tend to mainly be concerned about are these things (and not "we need more fees *now*"):
* Because demand varies over time and blocks are and usually should be mostly full, Bitcoin should be able to handle a fee market. It's normal and nothing to be afraid of. Wallets that don't do something like Core's `estimatefee` are simply broken. I have *never* had a transaction get permanently stuck, and even though I try to pay the lowest fees possible, I very rarely have transactions take more than a few blocks to get a confirmation.
* The community should not get into the habit of expecting a max block size increase whenever demand exceeds supply. Scarcity is a normal part of the universe, and Bitcoin will not collapse due to scarcity of block space. While 2 MB would be safe now, and steps are being taken to increase the max block size to 2 MB very soon, these blocks will quickly get filled again, and significantly larger block sizes are probably *not* safe right now. If it's a choice between low fees and decentralization, the correct choice is decentralization.
* It's impossible for Bitcoin to directly support even a decent chunk of the world's transactions while still retaining its competitive/useful properties (decentralization, etc.). For smallish transactions, off-chain systems are the only long-term option. Hopefully fees will remain *rather* low (below $1) forever, but doing every coffee transaction on-chain isn't going to work long-term.
Today, the issue with larger blocks is centralization risk. 8 MB blocks would for example require so much bandwidth (especially upload bandwidth) that it'd exclude too many people from being full nodes. (Also, the network would probably just fall apart as things are currently.) Almost all experts agree that 2 MB would be safe if various DoS issues are addressed, which is why there will be an increase of the max block size to *roughly* 2 MB via a softfork around April (SegWit), and maybe this will be solidified to *definitely/always* 2 MB in 2017 sometime (the Hong Kong hardfork proposal). I could see further increases to 4-8 MB in 2017 or 2018 if IBLT and/or weak blocks are successfully implemented sometime this year as planned and if they end up providing the expected benefits.

They're both pretty risky. BTC has a fair bit of technological risk (crypto failures, etc.), as well as a lot of volatility/speculation. EUR is basically guaranteed to lose money long-term, and there's some chance that it'll become worthless in 10 years. Between the two I'd choose BTC because I think that it has much a higher expected value, but it's far better to diversify at least somewhat into gold and other things.

"Naka" and "moto" are extremely common in Japanese names. See, for example:

Japanese words, including names, are usually formed by sticking together several "sub-words" (representing kanji), so this sort of thing is much more common than in English. Also, while Satoshi's family name has within Bitcoin traditionally been written 中本, Satoshi never specified (because he was obviously not actually Japanese...), and different kanji are commonly used in Japan for the name "Nakamoto". Alternatives include 中元, 沖本, and 中許. These kanji have different meanings, so they're really different names.

Storage is basically already solved. Here's the plan:
* Miners will start committing to a hash of all unspent transaction outputs in their blocks.
* Using that, you will be able to sync *backwards*. First you'll download all of the headers, then download the last 1000 blocks or whatever from the longest chain and assume that the oldest UTXO tree is valid, download those UTXOs, and validate the next 1000 blocks normally to make sure they're valid. Then do basically the same thing for then next older 1000 blocks, etc. With this, in less than an hour you will be a "pseudo-full node" with much of the security of a real full node, and then in the background you will continue to download and verify more data until you are a complete full node.
* When syncing backwards is implemented, probably the default will be to download only the last 2 years of history or something, since everyone will basically *know* that the older history is valid.
* Using pruning, you'll only have to store a few GBs at any one time.
* To allow people to do the initial sync, nodes will be able to say "I also want to help the network by storing x GB of data", and you'll store x GB of a random range of blocks. The initial sync will then require searching out nodes that have what you want, but that won't be all that difficult.
* If the UTXO set becomes too large, there's a way to allow the network to forget old UTXOs but still allow the owner to spend it by providing a few kB of extra data when they spend it.

BitGo does something like that, I think. Probably all of the major Bitcoin payment processors do. But most experts would advise against it, since it's impossible to get a 100% success rate. These companies have so much volume that they can usually just eat the cost of the occasional fraud that slips through their risk analysis. When sending money to these sorts of companies, people should usually not send with RBF enabled. Probably the Bitcoin payment protocol should be adjusted to add a flag for requesting no RBF.
But in general, for normal people:
* If you can somehow reverse your end of a trade, accepting a 0-conf transaction is fine. For example, if you're accepting payment for something but you're not going to actually ship it until tomorrow, and you'll check the transaction's status before shipping it, then it's fine to accept it with 0 confirmations. Or if you know your trade partner's identity, you could accept the transaction with 0 confirmations but then rely on the legal system if they defraud you.
* If your end of the trade is irreversible, then you should require at least 1 confirmation before doing your end, and even more for high-value transactions.
None of this changes with RBF except that it's *slightly* easier for someone to reverse 0-conf transactions (ie. it goes from "pretty easy" to "a bit of a hassle").

You can run Bitcoin Core with walletbroadcast=0. Then when you send a transaction, it won't be broadcast -- you'll have to manually get the transaction with `gettransaction` (in bitcoind or the debug console) and paste it to a transaction pushtx service.
One potential limitation with this is that Bitcoin Core puts the current block number into transactions. Some fuzziness is introduced for privacy, but I'm not sure if it's enough for your use-case.

This isn't very practical because each person has a totally different view of name assignments and has to either manually define names (like a hosts file) or delegate this authority to a selection of centralized entities. If it somehow became the mainstream DNS standard, then I imagine it'd transform into something almost identical to modern DNS, where you *already can* theoretically run competing registries, but in practice everyone just uses the same root zone because it's extremely useful for there to be one global view of the DNS.
A good decentralized DNS should probably use the Bitcoin block chain to help reach a single global state. (Decentralized DNS is something I've thought about for many years, but I never reached a particularly satisfying solution. There are many half-baked ways of doing it which would basically work, but they have various problems.)

On-chain payments will always be *more* expensive than off-chain payments, but there's not necessarily a need for on-chain transactions to be especially expensive. If most day-to-day transactions are happening off-chain, and so demand for on-chain space is sufficiently low, sub-$1 transaction fees may well be stable. Long-term, I tend to envision off-chain payments as analogous to day-to-day credit card payments, and on-chain payments as analogous to bank transfers.

I kind of like the idea of UBI if it *replaces* existing welfare, since it reduces the size of government. If for example you completely got rid of medicare, medicaid, social security, and several welfare programs, it seems that you could get around $2.5 trillion/year, which would be enough to give every American who makes *less than about $70k/year (60% of Americans)* a basic income of $12k/year. Obviously it'd be *ideal* from a libertarian perspective to have zero welfare, but I'd be pretty happy with the change I just described, since it'd massively shrink the size of government in terms of complexity and number of employees. There's virtually no chance of UBI being implemented anywhere on Earth as a welfare *replacement* like this, though...
Anyway, on Yang's cryptocurrency position:
* The IRS's current stance (where Bitcoin is property, but **not** a security, contrary to what this article says) is very clear, and is the only sane way for cryptocurrency to fit into current US tax law. Treating it as a foreign currency doesn't make sense, often results in much higher tax rates, and the de minimis rules wouldn't actually help much due to crypto's large price movements. Obviously it'd be *nice* if they exempted Bitcoin from income tax (or eliminated income tax entirely...), but they're not going to do that.
* "Yang: Not every crypto asset is a security" Yeah, that's what the IRS said in 2014, what the [SEC recently said]( and what's been obvious forever. Whether some subset of coins/tokens *are* securities, and which, is what's up for debate, but things like Bitcoin obviously aren't securities.
* Government regulation is always bad, and always favors whoever can afford to spend the most money on lobbying. In Bitcoin's case this will be entities which want to stifle Bitcoin such as banks, and anti-freedom crypto companies like Coinbase which will want to prevent competition.

A hardfork should proceed only if there is no significant opposition. In a contentious hardfork:
* Bitcoin is split into two pieces, which is extremely damaging to Bitcoin.
* There is an attempt to coerce people who want to stick with the core consensus rules they originally agreed to into abandoning these rules.
If a sufficient degree of agreement can be had, then I'm fine with hardforks otherwise. Something like flexcap is probably a good idea in the long-run, though I'm not sure that the current proposals guarantee Bitcoin's long-term security. Probably this requires a lot more research. The hardfork proposal that BlueMatt et al. will present later this year as a result of their Hong Kong agreement might be uncontroversial enough to get sufficient agreement.
In any case, almost all hardforks *can* be done as softforks instead. SegWit is one example of increasing capacity without a hardfork, and in a very non-disruptive way. A hardfork would in many cases be cleaner, but if it ends up being the case that sufficient consensus is basically impossible to achieve in most cases, the prospect of relying entirely on softforks doesn't worry me at all. Possibly, hardfork-type changes in Bitcoin will almost always be done first as a softfork, and then the softfork will be made simpler and more efficient in an uncontroversial hardfork later. (Sidechains would allow for doing this in a particularly clean way.)

In the future things will be adjusted so that you can sync *backwards*. Then you'll be a "pseudo-full node" in less than an hour, but you'll continue to download more historical blocks in the background to become more and more confident that you're on a valid chain. Once this backward syncing is implemented, probably people will typically only download the last 2 years of transaction history or something, and the rest will be forgotten by almost everyone.

It's kind of funny (and kind of sad) that people are still getting conned by Craig Wright after he *blatantly failed* to pretend to be Satoshi on like 3 previous occasions.

It's not even really questionable: Like maybe if he actually had the private keys associated with the coinbases in blocks  or whatever, you could at least make a case (though very inconclusive).

The list of evidence actually linking Wright to Satoshi is *empty*. Moreover, in (at least) his first attempt, he left some pretty clear-cut evidence that he intentionally fabricated the "evidence" that he did produce (the webpages he pointed to were proven to have been created recently rather than in ~2009 as claimed, and the falsely-dated PGP signature he made used recent gpg defaults rather than defaults circa the signature's date or settings that had never been defaults).

If a miner does not validate extblocks, he may build off of blocks with invalid extblocks. Extblock-validating miners will then orphan his blocks. It's similar to miners who are "SPV mining" today. This issue would be avoided with proper merge-mined sidechains rather than directly tying extblocks to canonical blocks.
The proposal as written also seems to suggest that 100% of miners would have to include a resolution transaction in their blocks, which requires being fully-validating on extblocks. But I don't see this as actually being strictly necessary, ignoring the previously-mentioned SPV-mining issues.

I think that the network could function without a protocol-defined max block size. The client could look at its available bandwidth, disk space, CPU power, etc., and from these calculate the max block size that it is capable of accepting constantly for the next few years. Blocks that get too close to this limit are "discouraged", and blocks that exceed the limit are rejected entirely. If a long block chain ends up being rejected due to these rules, Bitcoin can give the user a warning, and the user can decide whether to stick to his guns or to start using a lightweight network mode. These rules would incentivize miners to keep blocks small enough that most users would accept them.
Gmaxwell has proposed including the root of a Merkle tree of all unspent transactions in blocks. This would allow users to become full nodes (basically) without having to download every block ever created. In fact, I think it allows the network to forget old blocks entirely. Adopting this proposal would make it *much* easier for people to become full nodes in a network without a max block size.
It's safer to have a (mostly) fixed max block size, though. I'm sure that Bitcoin can work reasonably well even if the max block size stays at 1MB forever. More transactions would just have to take place off of the chain using other protocols and services.
Which max block size strategy to accept is probably the most important decision that will ever be made about Bitcoin. It requires a lot of debate.

Ah, I think I figured out a more damaging one. I haven't tested this, but I think the attacker could put a huge fake chain in the database (much longer than the real chain), but mark it as orphaned. Then the attacker can just add a block to that fake chain whenever he wants to gain control and give any of his transactions 6+ confirmations. Bitcoin would never warn about this, since it will always think that no other chains are longer.

The point of that block number was to show how to make this change with reasonable advance notice, not to suggest a particular block number for doing the change. That post was made on Oct 4, 2010 when the block height was about 83530. Probably how he got block  was that he rounded this to 80000 and added the expected number of blocks in 9 months (~35000). If he was actually suggesting that the change be made at that block number, then he would've had to have actually put this code into Bitcoin very quickly after his post there for his statement "it can start being in versions way ahead" to make any sense at all. (And clearly he didn't do this.)
This sort of "flag day" method for doing a hardfork is the preferred way of doing hardforks among the Core devs. It's how the only previous hardfork was done, and how Satoshi did the version checksum change, which was very much like a hardfork (though he used a time *two years* in advance). Notably, most hardfork supporters today do *not* use this method, preferring instead to use a stupid miner majority thing.

Address reuse has always been discouraged (in the past mainly for anonymity reasons), though I guess it's still not discouraged loudly enough. Bitcoin Core has always discouraged reuse, for example:
* Bitcoin used to have a big GUI element that said "Your Bitcoin Address: &lt;address&gt;", and the address would change whenever you received a payment to encourage you to use a different address each time. [Here's Satoshi talking about this](
* Now the GUI for receiving payments requires you to basically create an "invoice" for each payment, which likewise encourages users to view addresses as a per-transaction thing.
* `getaccountaddress` similarly returns a new address whenever the old one has been paid to.
In a few cases it's just so much more convenient to reuse addresses that it's grudgingly accepted, such as in your Eligius example. It's expected that someday something like stealth addresses will replace these uses.

A lot of people think that miners are Bitcoin's rulers, but this is thankfully not true. See:  . In particular, miners have no say in hardforks. The damage that miners can do is somewhat limited, and this could be further limited if fraud proofs were added to Bitcoin.
It is a big problem, though, especially from the perspective of censorship-resistance. Right now China could order the majority of mining power to reject blocks and transactions not made by "verified" individuals, for example. (The appropriate response to this would be to change the PoW algorithm.)
There are no widely-accepted ideas for fixing mining centralization.

There are three possible bottlenecks: CPU, disk, and bandwidth. Bandwidth is very rarely the bottleneck nowadays for people with a reasonably fast connection.
First, check your CPU usage. If it's often near 100%, then you're probably CPU-bound. You can improve this by upgrading to [0.12.0]( As I'm writing this, binaries are only available for rc3, which has a known bug with pruning -- don't enable pruning until the final release of 0.12.0. (Pruning is a command-line option, so you won't enable it accidentally.)
Otherwise, the syncing process is probably disk-bound. Oftentimes, *especially* on laptops, you can improve disk performance by disabling APM on your disk using the hdparm utility. The command is `hdparm -B 254 /dev/sda`, replacing /dev/sda with your actual disk. hdparm is available for both Linux and Windows. Also, apparently [CrystalDiskInfo]( can do the same thing on Windows, but with a GUI. (APM makes your disk less power-consuming and noisy, but at the cost of performance.)
Another way to help things if your performance is disk-bound is to run Bitcoin Core with the command-line option `-dbcache=1000`. Bitcoin Core will then use an extra 1000 MB of memory for caching. You can replace 1000 with whatever you want, but leave at least 1.5 GB free.
It is a pretty slow process, though, and that speed doesn't seem *completely* crazy.

BIP148 has several problems:
* It activates *very* quickly. Except when the UASF fixes a security problem such that the risk of a UASF-caused fork is outweighed by the continuing existence of the security problem, probably at least 1 year from *release in wallet software* (not the date of the BIP) is needed.
* If it is expected that miners will not adopt the UASF before activation, then the UASF has almost identical effects to a hardfork. Just do a flag-day hardfork on a 1-2 year timer.
* Bitcoin doesn't and shouldn't have voting, but a UASF proposal should include a detailed, methodical study of the mechanisms and reasoning for ensuring that the UASF will activate only with a supermajority of the economy enforcing it. There should probably be a several-step process of measuring and guaranteeing economic support. At the end of this process should be a simultaneous release of UASF-enforcing wallet software. Note that for many UASFs, lightweight wallets can hard-enforce the UASF, either directly or via fraud proofs.

LN requires some on-chain transactions. The best case would require perhaps 1 on-chain transaction per month per user, but it's actually likely to be worse than that due to sub-optimal network graphs. So if on-chain fees are too high, LN isn't particularly useful, and we'd have to accept worse but more efficient off-chain solutions (of which there are many, BTW, so any fee level is *survivable*).


With the current 1 million vBytes, you'd need an average fee of 1250 sat/vB to replace the entire current 12.5 BTC subsidy. For a typical full-SegWit transaction, that's somewhere around 0.0018 BTC = $9. Much higher than I'd like, but still cheaper than many bank transfers. This also assumes that there will be no additional on-chain scaling beyond SegWit, and that the mining reward should never be reduced from 12.5 BTC, neither of which I believe.

Personally, I don't find the fees or incentives arguments to be particularly convincing.

The US is basically already engaging in MMT. The US owes over $67k per citizen, and nobody *really* expects it to ever pay this back. (Do you?) Congress is nowhere close to even seriously considering the idea of reducing the debt, only (sometimes) slowing the rate of growth.
But there's a sort of mass delusion making people think that this situation is actually sustainable or something, and I seriously doubt that the US is going to say, "OK, we're doing MMT now," even if some fringe politicians are mentioning it. And IMO this mass delusion could allow the US to go *decades* without experiencing its probably-inevitable debt crisis. So I personally wouldn't make short-term investment decisions based on runaway US debt.

Bitcoin Core already downloads from several peers at once like BitTorrent. The bottleneck is usually at the CPU or disk nowadays. It needs to verify all of the transactions and separate them into an organized database.
In the future, probably there will be a softfork to require that miners commit to a tree of unspent transaction outputs. Then it will be possible to sync *backwards*, and you'll be able to become a "mostly-full node" in less than an hour, while still eventually reaching real full node status after you've downloaded everything (or at least the last couple years).

You don't need to understand how public-key crypto works mathematically in order to understand Bitcoin. You just need to understand its properties.
PKC has three important operations for signing (Bitcoin doesn't use public-key encryption, only signing):
Create keypair: Creates a public key and a private key. Both of these keys are just very long numbers. The two keys are related mathematically. In ECDSA, the PK algorithm Bitcoin uses, the public key can be computed directly from the private key. However, it is very difficult to compute the private key from the public key. You can safely give out your public key and trust that no one can figure out your private key in at least the next few decades.
Sign: Given some arbitrary data and a private key, produces a *signature*. Like keys, a signature is just a long number (in ECDSA).
Verify: Given some data, a signature, and a public key, calculates whether the signature was produced using the given data and the private key associated with the given public key.
So if I securely give someone my public key, I can sign messages to them and they can verify that I signed the messages. No one can sign messages using my public key unless they have my private key.
This is used in Bitcoin transactions. BTC transactions are credited to public keys. (Bitcoin addresses are basically public keys.) If I have 100 BTC at public key A and I want to send it to public key B, I need to write a message saying, "transfer 100 BTC from public key A to public key B," and sign it using the private key associated with my public key A. If B wants to send the BTC later, he writes and signs a similar message using his private key. 
The details of this are pretty complicated, but from a high level it's simple. It's like signing a check: you tell your bank (or the network in Bitcoin's case) that you want some money to be moved. It's verified with a signature.
Blocks use only hashing, not any signing.

It's likely that several people are right now running programs that try to guess brainwallet passwords. I'd be uneasy with using even a 14-character random password for something like this. You're basically daring the entire world to guess your password.
Brainwallet tools should ask users for unforgettable personal info such as full names and use this info as salt for the passwords.

In order to solve the double-spending problem, it uses semi-centralized servers. The proposal sort of supposes that anyone could become a server, and this therefore makes it a bit decentralized, but because it relies on each server *polling* other servers to determine "real" transaction ordering, you'd end up with something that's at least somewhat centralized, and probably in reality it'd quickly become pretty solidly centralized. It also doesn't provide any hard guarantees about anything (eg. convergence, proof-of-fraud, inflation schedule, etc.). If someone proposed something like B-money nowadays (and people do...), it'd be seen as the worst sort of hand-wavey scamcoin garbage, but for 1998 I suppose it was groundbreaking.
Solving double-spending in a decentralized way was Bitcoin's primary breakthrough.

You can do a proper merge-mined sidechain instead. It has a similar end result, but it doesn't have this problem, and it's also better in some other ways. An SPV-security sidechain is going to allow miners to steal all funds on the sidechain, but that'll be the end result of huge extblocks anyway -- a sidechain just removes the obfuscation / false sense of security.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:01:49


It is a definite concern, but my general view of miner centralization is that it's already a lost cause, and would require a PoW change to properly fix. For example, you *already* need to be a member of a [centralized relay network]( in order to effectively mine. Better to strengthen full nodes so that they act as an effective check on miners, and have a PoW change ready in case of evil actions by miners.


Traditionally, no, all Bitcoin full nodes would validate all extension blocks. But traditionally, an extension blocks softfork would only be done for modest max-block-size increases, the kind that you might be able to do with a hardfork. If they try to create huge extblocks in this proposal, then the result will be that almost no full nodes will verify the extblocks. This is not the end of the world because this proposal has the 2-way-peg aspect -- you end up with a particularly poor/inefficient SPV-security sidechain alongside Bitcoin-proper, maybe with additional fork risk.

Yeah, Satoshi's original idea was that nearly 100% of commerce would be done via a single multi-functional client that would include the currency along with a decentralized marketplace, trust system, etc. This is why the first versions of Bitcoin were GUI-only, with no way to access them programmatically. It wasn't until 0.2.6 -- over a year after Bitcoin's release -- that Satoshi apparently gave up on this vision as being over-broad, creating the JSON-RPC interface which allowed centralized websites to interface with Bitcoin.
It's funny to note that his early marketplace design would've determined a user's trust in part by seeing how many blocks they'd mined. At least early on, he clearly thought that home mining would be viable for a long time, and he didn't anticipate pooled mining at all.

It wouldn't be much more difficult than credit cards. Bitcoin users would load some amount of BTC onto a credit-card-sized device (which doesn't require its own Internet connectivity), this device will communicate with some hardware that the merchant has, and the merchant's device will do the necessary Internet verification.
You can't securely receive BTC without Internet access, so things would be more difficult in a few cases (refunds, merchants without Internet access, etc.)

New code is less tested and more likely to contain flaws. Therefore, in environments where stability and/or security are vitally important, it makes sense to delay upgrading for a while. Also, sometimes it takes a long time for people (especially businesses) to test and integrate a new version with their systems, since new major versions might remove or change features that people rely on.
Bitcoin Core has always accommodated and to some degree even encouraged adopting new major versions gradually. That's part of why there's no auto-update mechanism. Also, at least the current major version *and* the last major version are supported. So for example when the CLTV softfork was rolled out, there was both a 0.11.2 release and a 0.10.4 release, since 0.10 is still supported. People who relied on 0.10's behavior could have upgraded to 0.10.4 and been confident that nothing changed interface-wise.
People should not be running end-of-life versions like 0.11.0 or 0.10.2, though. I'm not sure where these come from. Outdated Linux packages, maybe? It's not a *huge* security issue, but these people are verifying only part of the rules at this point, which could in rare cases lead to problems.

If you are accepting 0-conf transactions and you don't have a sophisticated network of nodes on the network listening for double-spends along with some smart technology for detecting high-risk transactions, then you are already totally insecure. The only reason that no one's reversed these transactions is that they were honest, lazy, or ignorant. Bitcoin has *never* natively provided any irreversibility guarantees for 0-conf transactions. You either need to switch to accepting only transactions with 1+ confirmations, or you need to set something up to detect stuck or conflicted transactions and "undo" whatever you did after receiving the payment.

Representing Bitcoin's 2,100,000,000,000,000 base units takes 51 bits. Representing 21,000,000,000,000,000 base units would take 55 bits -- too much for a double.

It's unfortunate that all of the proven-safe database code has to be replaced with unproven code, but it's necessary. The old method is too slow. This change isn't much more dangerous than other major code changes that have occurred in the past.
I'd like to see separate stable and unstable versions of Bitcoin-Qt maintained, with stable releases 6-12 months behind unstable releases on features such as this. But even this much testing might miss some serious bugs in the new code (if, for example, the bugs are triggered by rare network conditions). The developers can't let fear of these bugs prevent them from improving the client when necessary.
This kind of issue is why I like to see a lot of heterogeneity in the network: many different versions of many different clients, so one serious bug in some code can't bring down the network. I'm glad that there's no autoupdate feature.

I don't want the Foundation to own much stuff because this would allow an attacker to do serious damage to Bitcoin by attacking/compromising a single organization. If different people control Bitcoin's assorted important assets, it's more likely that some of the assets will be compromised, but it's much less likely that all of them will be compromised.
Control of bitcoin.org (which I know the Foundation wants) is especially dangerous. With bitcoin.org, the Foundation would have the main distribution point of Bitcoin-Qt, plus the alert key (via gavin) and a lot of favor with the core development group. I fear that a compromised Foundation with all of this power could easily get a large number of users to upgrade to a version of Bitcoin with bad modifications. Currently, bitcoin.org is operated by the Bitcoin-Qt developers but owned by an independent individual. I like this arrangement.

First, you need to create a SegWit-enabled address. This looks exactly like a P2SH address (starting with 3), and pretty much every existing client can already send BTC to it, but it's specially-constructed for SegWit. Transactions to a SegWit-enabled address are indistinguishable from normal P2SH transactions.
Then to spend BTC received at a P2SH transaction:
* The scriptPubKey you're solving is just a single constant (the 32-byte witness script hash), enclosed in P2SH. With the pre-SegWit rules, anyone could spend this, but additional restrictions are added after the SegWit softfork.
* Somewhat separately from the rest of the transaction, you include the witness (basically the same as a modern scriptSig), which has to include the full script associated with the witness script hash (very much like a P2SH-encapsulated scriptPubKey).
Here's an example SegWit spend, taken from BIP 141:
    witness:      0 &lt;signature1&gt; &lt;1 &lt;pubkey1&gt; &lt;pubkey2&gt; 2 CHECKMULTISIG&gt;
    scriptSig:    &lt;0 &lt;32-byte-hash&gt;&gt;
    scriptPubKey (being spent/solved): HASH160 &lt;20-byte-hash&gt; EQUAL
The scriptPubKey is just the normal P2SH scriptPubKey, enclosing the 32-byte witness script hash. The scriptSig trivially solves the P2SH scriptPubKey, providing &lt;32-byte-hash&gt; as the P2SH-enclosed script and a leading 0 constant as an identifier and version number for SegWit scriptSigs. Then the witness is basically the same as a modern-day P2SH-spend transaction, providing the final, actual scriptPubKey as a trailing constant, which must match the witness script hash, plus the script arguments

Bitcoin transactions contain programs written in a very basic programming language (called Script). The programs specify exactly what conditions one must meet before being allowed to spend a certain chunk of BTC. When you send BTC to address 1Abc..., your Bitcoin client writes an incomplete Script program and puts it in the block chain. To spend this BTC, the owner of 1Abc... must complete the program so that the program outputs *true*. Only the person who owns address 1Abc... can complete the program. It's like a puzzle.
Most commonly, Scripts are written so that only the owner of an address can complete them. But they can also be written to require different conditions, as you can see in the article. It's pretty cool. Satoshi really put a lot of thought into this.

If you have a backup from before your most recent transaction, you could also restore from the backup.

* If you don't specify an account, the script will try to send from the "" account, which might still have insufficient funds. It's best to just use a real account.

The biggest issue is that it needlessly interferes with SegWit, apparently for political reasons. For the proposal to be at all acceptable, it needs to avoid such nonsense.
Additional problems:
* Miners will be required to verify extblocks, acting as a centralizing force in mining.
* Small extblocks might make some sense, but *large* extblocks are the worst of all worlds: extension block verification is going to end up centralized to miners and maybe a few big players, but you won't get instant confirmations, increased anonymity, or super-high capacity in return for the centralization. There are many other solutions which require lesser degrees of centralization for greater benefits.
* If miners and only a small handful of big players actually verify the extblocks, which would certainly be the case for extblocks that are tens of MB in size, then it's quite possible for long or even permanent forks to occur between those who verify the extblocks and those who don't. Either everybody should verify the extblocks or nobody (but miners) should, but huge extblocks *aren't* going to be verified by everybody.
* If a lot of the economy moves to reduced-security extblocks, this'd weaken the economy. Reminiscent of the creep of fractional reserve banking.
If you get rid of the anti-SegWit political nonsense, I view it as a *bad* proposal, clearly worse than other scaling solutions, but perhaps not too dangerous. The 2-way-peg aspect resolves some of the past criticisms of extblocks, I think.

Mining is like repeatedly flipping 256 coins until the binary number that these coins form is below a certain number. Difficulty is increased by lowering the target number. Nodes decide to change the difficulty by looking at how fast blocks are generated: if 2016 blocks were generated in less than 2 weeks, then difficulty is proportionally increased (and vice-versa).

Several core rules have already been changed since 0.1, and changes will be made in the future. For example, it's currently illegal to create a block larger than 1 MB.

8 decimals of precision is the largest amount of precision that still allows the number of bitcoins to be safely stored in a double-precision floating point number.

This is overblown. I watched some of the congressional hearing on this, and it was funny how the congressmen thought that the US somehow had some deep ownership over the Internet via ICANN. In reality, the Internet, kind of like Bitcoin, has no rulers. (And the CEO of ICANN was trying to tell the congressmen this in the hearing, but they didn't get it...) Although ICANN has de facto universal control over the DNS root zone and IP address allocation, this is only by convention. You could set up a separate DNS root zone right now, and ISPs could use their own IP address allocation systems. This would run the risk of making the Internet less of a single continuous space, but it's entirely possible to do. The only reason that nobody's really put much effort into trying something like this is that that ICANN has done a pretty good job overall.
Also, I think that the ICANN organization is reasonably good. They seem to have a pretty pro-freedom, hands-off attitude. One of the previous CEOs of ICANN wrote the book *The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations*, and the current chairman of the board invented the IETF RFC process (which Bitcoin's BIPs are indirectly based off of). I suppose it's possible that ICANN could somehow be co-opted by the UN or something, but I don't think that it's likely to happen anytime soon, at least, and if it does happen then as I mentioned previously ICANN has no power except what people freely give it.
Maybe Bitcoin could even learn some lessons from ICANN, since ICANN's (and the IETF's) task is similar to the task of developing the core Bitcoin network. Like Bitcoin, the Internet itself is totally decentralized, but quite a bit of coordination is necessary to keep the network in one piece. (Not that ICANN is anywhere near perfect, but it's something to learn from, at least.)

I've only briefly heard of it, I don't know anything about it.
I'm just not sure what they think they're getting from colored coins as opposed to physical titles. For example, although the Bitcoin block chain provides reasonably-accurate and reliable timestamping, there's nothing to stop the owner of a property from issuing *two* colored coins for the same property and selling them both, or issuing a colored coin for a property that he doesn't actually own. AFAICT there's no way to check for the former case except to search through the metadata for all physical-property colored coins (assuming a metadata format that *can* be searched in this way), or perhaps for a government to assign one satoshi to every square foot of land at the start. Bitcoin can't inherently stop double-spending of the assets covered by colored coins.
But maybe they are finding a good use for colored coins -- I won't rule it out.

No, they only need to be spent. After initial verification, you only need to read an output when someone is trying to spend it. Once it is spent, you never need to read it again unless there is a reorg, so you can forget it once it's deep enough in the chain (if you don't care about providing that transaction to new nodes for full verification).

Nope. Bitcoin Core supports importing addresses as watch-only, but you have to give it a big list of addresses from elsewhere -- although 0.13 has HD wallet support, it doesn't support xpub keys yet.


There are good reasons for not wanting to share your xpub. First, if someone has your xpub key and *any* of the associated private keys, then they can trivially calculate *all* of the private keys associated with the xpub (except for "hardened" keys, but most wallets don't create those). Also, a lot of wallet software supports just one or two xpub keys per wallet, so publishing it is a major privacy issue.
But other than that, there's no particular issue with publishing your xpub.
Not sure I completely understand what you want to do, but maybe this'd work:
* On a semi-offline computer, generate 10k addresses.
* Import them into Bitcoin Core on your live server as watch-only addresses.
* When a new user registers, assign them one of these addresses. (You'll also need to periodically refill the addresses)
* If someone wants to tip, always give them this person's address.
* On the semi-offline computer, every day or week, sweep all collected BTC to the final recipients. Do it in as few transactions as possible: you might not always be able to do it in just one transaction because there's a limit on transaction size, but you should be able to do it in a small number of transactions. This is the point at which you'd ideally want to use per-recipient stealth addresses (not widely supported), xpub keys (known only to the tipping service and the recipient), or a list of addresses provided by each recipient in order to allow the final recipients to avoid reusing addresses.
Then anyone will be able to check on the block chain how much BTC each person received, but it might be a little difficult to figure out exactly where their BTC actually ended up, which is good for privacy. (For extra privacy, you could do stuff like using a random number of additional outputs/addresses per recipient.) If you need to let people verify that the BTC is actually reaching the final recipients, then you basically have to enforce address reuse or something not much better.
One thing to keep in mind is that although experts like to preach against address reuse constantly, it's not the end of the world if you do it. The most major problem with it is that it severely hurts privacy for you and everyone you transact with. Secondarily, there are crypto-related security benefits to avoiding address reuse which will probably not be practically important for at least several years. The most important thing is to avoid *assuming* address reuse; for example, it's very bad practice to send someone two transactions at the same address when they were expecting just one, since that assumes a level of address reuse which may not exist, potentially leading to losses.

Note that some wallets (eg. Bitcoin Core) won't actually let you create the B-&gt;C transaction until the A-&gt;B transaction has at least 1 confirmation. Though some other wallets do allow it.
Also, a single block can contain both transactions, so they can both confirm at the same time.
@_date: 2012-08-07 08:41:42
I'm not sure that incentives will actually work like that in the future. The best short-term strategy for miners is to include as many fee-paying transactions as possible. Long-term, this causes a "race to the bottom": transaction fees per transaction approach zero, since any fee-paying transaction will get picked up by someone fairly quickly. If this happens, mining will no longer be profitable and the difficulty will become too low. 
The problem is that Bitcoin users want total fees to be high enough to support reasonably high total mining power (to prevent 51% attacks), but paying transaction fees doesn't buy you more computational power -- transaction fees only buy you speedy inclusion into a block, which could be done on a difficulty-1 chain for all the network and economy cares.

It's easy to trick users. Just modify a transaction in the block database so it's worth a million BTC or something. Then you can send money to your tricked users using the coins in that transaction and they'll think it's valid. If you have a lot of mining power you can even give the transaction a few confirmations before Bitcoin starts warning the user.
There may be even more damaging attacks.

It was mostly newcomers who were affected. Similar to the recent bubble, a lot of people had lost money due to buying at ridiculously-high prices, and with every passing day their depression grew. A lot of them sold and left after a while, I think: FOMO on the way up and on the way down.
Investment in the ecosystem fell off a cliff. In the wider world, there was a perception that Bitcoin had just been a fad, and was now fading into nothingness. This was disappointing, but the core community knew that nothing had changed about the fundamentals, and so weathered it fairly well.

I don't know how the KeepKey works in particular. I don't know if one mnemonic can really restore both wallets with the KeepKey. But there's no problem with the idea in principle.
The mnemonic is used to generate a 256-bit *master seed*, which is then used to generate an infinite number of addresses + associated private keys using (usually) the algorithm specified in BIP 32. If your mnemonic is "this is a poor mnemonic", then you could generate the Bitcoin master seed as SHA-256("this is a poor mnemonic - Bitcoin") = f1a49848ae072ae8ab0ddc276317db8f8ffe0c18c5dbae46f9e445182b03e78a and the Litecoin master seed as SHA-256("this is a poor mnemonic - Litecoin") = 59c960fec4afc998246ae707ff33743c914ab7de0dc372a8cddc5598765e29c0. There's no security issue with reusing the seed like this -- even if Litecoin's whole security was somehow totally destroyed and it became possible for an adversary to recover your Litecoin master seed from your Litecoin addresses or something, then in order for the attacker to get your Bitcoin master seed without knowing your mnemonic, they'd have to totally break SHA-256. There are no known hints of ways to even come remotely close to breaking SHA-256 in this way.
(The way of generating seeds that I described above is not exactly how wallets actually do it, but it's somewhat similar.)

Electrum uses BIP 32 to generate an infinite number of Bitcoin keys from one 256-bit master key derived from a passphrase.
Many wallets use BIP 32, but they're often mutually incompatible because they use different wordlists, passphrase -&gt; master key functions, or BIP 32 derivations. But the algorithm is publicly known, at least. I don't know which other wallets/tools would accurately accept Electrum seeds (if any), but it'd certainly be possible to create one if Electrum somehow fell of the map.

Wasabi CoinJoins have roughly the same effect as Monero ring signatures, except that Wasabi would have a "mixin" value of 50+, far better than Monero's ~6. Monero is probably still better than Wasabi privacy-wise because Monero has ringCT and the Monero ecosystem uses stealth addresses consistently, but they're not all that far apart IMO.
Contrary to popular belief, Monero *cannot* be considered a total black box. While it's usually very difficult, there *are* ways that Monero transactions can be analyzed which do not require breaking any crypto.

Extreme micropayments could be done on a sidechain without a hardfork. And bringing any sidechain from SPV-level security to full Bitcoin-level security is always only a softfork.
I've always thought that it'd be cool (though maybe not super *useful*) to support sending rational numbers of BTC. So you could send someone exactly 1/3 BTC, for example.

The US is giving up oversight over ICANN, which some people worry will probably result in ICANN becoming part of the UN, which might be worse than US control.
* Controls the DNS root zone. In other words, they decide who controls .com, .net, .ninja, etc.
* Controls the assignment of IP addresses.
* Oversees the assignment of constants in Internet protocols, such as official port numbers.
To some degree, ICANN's power is just by convention. There's nothing legally or technically stopping one or more ISPs from using their own DNS root zone or their own IP address allocations, but doing so could lead to a situation in which customers of one ISP can't communicate with customers of another ISP, or must use different names/addresses to do so.
Decentralized DNS is something that I've long been interested in. There are two main unresolved problems IMO:
* How do you prevent one person from registering millions of names (all of the good ones), but without making it too expensive for ordinary people to register a few names? I feel like some sort of "price fixing" is unavoidable: either a fixed price in BTC, or a fixed amount of hashcash work, or something like that. This is centralizing and economically sub-optimal. The best idea I've come up with is that you could leave the price up to the end-users, and then when buying a domain you could pay whatever you want, with higher fees making it more likely that your domain will be registered from everyone's point of view. But this still isn't very good because 99.9% of people will just use the default price, and to the extent that people don't use the default price it will create multiple ideas of who owns which domains.
* If you have a domain name like pirated-movies-r-us.bitdns, it seems possible that legal liability may be introduced on everyone who serves info about this domain name after receiving a DMCA takedown. For example, if the DNS network has miners and they are in a position to do so, then they might censor all DNS transactions related to pirated-movies-r-us.bitdns. Similarly, even nodes might be prevented from serving transactions related to the domain name. Ideally, nobody should ever know which specific transactions contain info about which domains... though that's probably impossible.

Long-term, for end-users it should look a bit like:  . The average Bitcoin user should not need to worry about anything happening behind the scenes. I'm also a big believer in dedicated hardware (for basically everyone: consumers, point-of-sale, *and* websites) in the long-term.
Shorter-term, and for power users in the long-term, I envision a wallet which shows several different "accounts". One of them is the Bitcoin block chain more-or-less as it exists today. This is like a super-high-secure Swiss bank account which only supports wire transfers. One or more accounts will be a high-capacity account (possible underlying technologies: Lightning, hub-and-spoke, blinded bearer certs, high-capacity sidechains, etc.). This is like a checking account with a debit card. Optionally, any number of additional feature-based or experimental sidechains could be added, such as a high-anonymity sidechain. The wallet would support moving BTC between accounts, including automatically converting when an outgoing payment requires it. When atomic cross-chain transfers are desired by the user, this may require the use of a centralized but untrusted matchmaking server, whose URL (using a standard protocol) should be manually provided to the wallet by the user.
The main Bitcoin chain should focus on security, decentralization, stability, and being the best money possible. If features can be added without compromising these things, then that should be done once the development of these features is very mature. I'd especially like to see fungibiliy improvements, though so far such improvements tend to have too many trade-offs to be done on the base Bitcoin chain.

It's pretty cool, though I think to be useful in reality:
* They'd need to be quite cheap, less than $10 or so.
* You'd need a stand-alone device for very quickly plugging them in and verifying them. (It'd be even better if they used NFC + wireless power so that you could just throw several into a basket or whatever and it'd verify them all at once.)
* Each person would probably own quite a few in different denominations, using them like cash. (Maybe they should come with stickers saying how much BTC should be on it.)
Edit: Also, it needs some way of proving that it is an authentic OpenDime device. You can do this by having OpenDime sign one unique preloaded public key per device, and then to authenticate the device you challenge it to sign the current time or something with the device's unique key. If someone extracts the key from one device, OpenDime can add this key to a revocation list.

Right, though upgraded wallets will use the same sort of scriptPubKey when sending to other upgraded wallets, at least for now. A year or two down the line a new address format may be introduced to remove this extra indirection and gain some more efficiency, but for now SegWit addresses will always be standard P2SH addresses, with two layers of indirection (P2SH script hash + witness script hash) instead of the required one (witness script hash).
(If someone doesn't know anything about how Bitcoin transactions work at a low level, then the details of SegWit are going to sound like complete gibberish. I think that in the future, even if 99% of transactions are SegWit, transactions should still first be explained at the most primitive scriptPubKey+scriptSig level. From there, it isn't all that much of a stretch to add SegWit on top. Though thankfully, end-users don't need to know anything about this -- to them it's just SegWit addresses vs normal addresses, where spending BTC received via SegWit addresses is cheaper.)

The UTxO tree idea would be really nice. It would allow you become *basically* a full node in less than an hour, regardless of how large the block chain gets. Though there are some design-related problems (mentioned by gmaxwell in that discussion), so it probably won't happen too soon.

No, but it's made more difficult.
Let's say that you've received some BTC from Alice and you're going to send those coins to Bob, but Alice and Bob are secretly sharing all of their info with each other in order to identify you. In a normal transaction, Alice sees "I send to you, you send to an address which I know belongs to Bob". Bob sees "Coins arrive from you, and I know from Alice that those coins were sent to you by Alice". If you put a Wasabi CoinJoin in the middle there, then Alice instead sees "I send to you, you send to [any of several dozen possible places, with Bob on the list]". Bob instead sees "Coins arrive from you, and the coins came from [any of several dozen possible inputs, with Alice's send to you as one listed possibility]". Note that some info is immediately leaked: you still appear in a certain subset of possibilities which isn't all that large. Furthermore, in-depth investigation and/or data leaks over time may further narrow down the subset by identifying and eliminating possibilities on the input/output lists. Doing multiple CoinJoin rounds makes things harder to follow.
Anonymity is very difficult, and anonymity tech isn't that great. There isn't much that can provide you with real *guarantees* of anything. Use any anonymity tech with the expectation that it can be broken under active attack and that any data still out there (eg. block chain data) will eventually be de-anonymized. I'm not talking about Wasabi specifically here, but *any* anonymity tech, including for example Tor.
I haven't looked into it as much as I'd like yet, but Wasabi looks very good.

No, it's a major consideration in Bitcoin. The goal is to maximize the number of full nodes, but all full nodes need to download all historical blocks. At the current ~4MB/block maximum, that's 210GB *per year* that archive nodes need to store forever and new full nodes need to download. If new full nodes need to download &amp; validate eg. 1 TB, and it's slow because there are few archive nodes able to provide this data, then that's a major barrier to entry. And no Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency is secure unless the economy is backed by full nodes. This is one of the reasons that luke-jr advocates *reducing* the max block size (though he's very much in the minority on that).
If you were only concerned with live transaction data, then Bitcoin's current 4 MB max block size requires only ~53 kbps for absolute minimal full nodes. While the network could not function if *most* nodes were near the minimum required bandwidth, you'd think that higher values would be OK if this was the only consideration. 
The reason that SegWit's tx capacity increase was OK was because it limits future burden:
* One of the major long-term costs is the size of the UTXO set. Extra witness data does not increase the size of the UTXO set, while extra non-witness data can.
* Since Bitcoin Core already by default skips script verification in very old blocks, it could just not download the witness data in those blocks without reduction in security. (This optimization is not performed yet, though.) Whereas you need to download the non-witness data in order to figure out the current UTXO set.
Also, Grin is not designed as a store of value, so it can more reasonably have smaller safety margins. This is one advantage to having it as a separate currency long-term rather than doing a sidechain, since a full-security Bitcoin sidechain would be able to affect the entire Bitcoin system, and so you'd want Bitcoin-level safety margins.

You can't fix a cryptocurrency's value onto any physical commodity or fiat currency without centralization.
Maybe you could have a Bitcoin wallet which always retains a consistent USD-denominated value by having the wallet automatically acquire (and at all times own) two futures contracts sufficient for all BTC in the wallet: one to sell all of your BTC at the current price, and one to buy all of your BTC at the current price. (Unfortunately, the Bitcoin derivatives market is currently very immature.)

The worst-case is if you're doing a simple BTC -&gt; ss.io -&gt; Monero -&gt; ss.io -&gt; BTC. If you're trying to anonymize 1 BTC, say, then ss.io sees the second transaction as:
* In 1: unknown amount
    * Prev-out 1 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 2 [decoy]
    * Prev-out 3 [known by ss.io to be the 1 BTC conversion from you]
    * [more decoys]
* Output: unknown amount [known by ss.io to be a ~1 BTC conversion]
In that sort of case, there is a little plausible deniability still, but it's pretty obvious to ss.io what's going on.
With Bitcoin, anonymity tends to decrease with every transaction, whereas with Monero anonymity tends to increase with every transaction. But even if you had a whole economy built entirely around Monero, it'd still be possible to combine lots of known data to get a good idea of which inputs are probably decoys and which may be real, especially if you can use data from one or more very popular services which control or created many UTXOs.

I don't know if it would have a huge impact on Bitcoin, but a DB collapse would be very interesting. The best-case scenario for the economy long-term would be for DB to be allowed to go through proper bankruptcy. But even though she says she definitely won't, I wouldn't be all that surprised if Merkel actually bails out DB (at least to some extent).
Bail-ins are poisonous, not so much because creditors/depositors lose some money -- that *should* happen when a borrower goes bankrupt --, but because it keeps a *clearly* bad business alive.
In the Cyprus crisis, the EU actually forced Cyprus to renege on its deposit insurance. So even people who deposited less than the 100k EUR limit lost money, even though Cyprus had previously promised to cover such losses. Since the EU was behind this, I definitely wouldn't rely on deposit insurance in any EU country. If I was in the EU, I'd get most of my money out of banks ASAP.

I don't particularly support keeping non-witness block sizes at 1 MB forever, but I don't think that it's incompatible with sufficient fees. First, it's important to realize that the current total mining power is not necessarily the *ideal* total mining power. In reality, Bitcoin is far out of the reach of any reasonably likely mining-based attacker other than the (rather centralized) miners themselves. I think that it'd be fine to reduce the total mining power to 25% or less of its current value, which allows for reducing the mining reward by at least a similar proportion.
But even at 12.5 BTC/block, that means a transaction fee of about 1250 sat/B. That's $2.50 for a "standard transaction" of 333 bytes, far less than an international wire transfer. On a multi-layer protocol involving sidechains, Lightning, etc., it does not seem totally unreasonable.

All versions before 0.8 had the behavior of randomly rejecting large blocks. If there is a hardfork here at all (debatable), then 0.8 accidentally hardforked, this was reverted (the accidental hardfork chain was abandoned), and then a few months later the same hardfork was intentionally done under more controlled circumstances.
This is often not considered a proper hardfork because you have to ask: what rule exactly was 0.8 breaking? Old nodes would *randomly* reject blocks, with larger blocks more likely to be rejected, and different nodes having different probabilities. The same node might reject a block once and then not reject it after restarting the syncing process from 0. There wasn't really any consistent rule, just random failures.

I agree that taxation is theft, but you have to ask yourself: is *that* the hill you want to die upon? Is the significantly increased risk of prosecution really worth anything you could buy with the money, or worth any change you could effect in the world through your non-compliance? If you make/retain a ton of money by breaking unjust laws and then try to portray yourself as a sort of freedom fighter, I think that you're probably really just deceiving yourself into doing something irrational.
Maybe there are good legal arguments for income tax being illegal in the US, but the world doesn't actually work based on laws. The constitution is not imbued with a magic spell which will strike dead anyone who defies it. What actually *happens* is that if you don't pay taxes, men from the government will haul you away if you are eventually found out, and they will ignore all of your legal arguments. (In fact, this might happen even if you *didn't* break any obvious laws, but the chances are lower.)
Also, Bitcoin's privacy is currently pretty poor unless you know exactly what you're doing, and anonymity tech in general can only barely be said to exist. Use "anonymity" tools (eg. Tor, Wasabi, coin mixers, XMR/grin) with the expectation that they will fail you at any moment, not with any sort of feeling of safety. You're fighting in the trenches, and these tools are a kevlar vest; they might keep you in the fight a little longer, but you're probably still going to become a casualty. So choose your fights carefully.

It'd be better for the online server to be a watch-only wallet which only tracks when BTC is received, but cannot spend them. You can use a preloaded list of addresses or an xpub arrangement to do this. Then someone compromising the live server couldn't steal any past BTC (though they could replace addresses that people will pay to in the future).
And it's better to avoid reusing addresses at all, though it's not going to totally break anything if you're dead-set on it.

Using checksums is good if you actually check any updates to make sure they're OK, and don't just update the checksums blindly. Using version numbers is better than nothing, but it's still trusting the repo itself not to lie to you about versions.


Gentoo does not use any authentication at all by default. It uses unencrypted rsync to get the package metainfo, and no signing is used, so any man-in-the-middle can insert their own packages. There is a way to make it more secure, but it's not that commonly used.
Yum and APT usually do use signatures and/or HTTPS with their default repos, though it's fairly common for end-users to add insecure repos. For example, the [official nginx repo instructions]( use no authentication at all.
Even on the repos with signing, the signing is usually done *automatically*, so if you can socially-engineer the process, you can get a signature. In the event-stream case, the person who inserted the backdoor *was authorized* to update the package, so it would've been signed in any conceivable world. The issue here is the *process for filling the repo*. There are different processes:
* npm etc. along with eg. Arch's AUR give the package uploader full control, with essentially no oversight. At best, they react after-the-fact to remove malware.
* Things like Google Play, addons.mozilla.org, and some Linux repos give the uploader *basically* full control, but attempt some oversight before actually publishing each new version. There are regular security incidents with these, since it's very difficult to detect malware, even if you're looking straight at the malicious code.
* Debian has one of the best repo processes, but it's still imperfect. On Debian, there are [257 people]( who can update at least one package at will to Unstable. Such packages then move to Testing and finally Stable over time. So an attacker needs to compromise one of those many maintainers and insert a backdoor that is subtle enough to not be noticed until too late: if the target is already using Unstable or Testing, then the attacker's work is made easier. Or the attacker just needs to compromise the machine that is auto-signing packages, which has happened from time to time to various distros. These attacks are difficult, but not impossible. (Other distros tend to have a process similar to Debian, but often less slow and careful.)
The underlying problem with all of this is *trust*. Instead of doing any verification on your own, you're trusting that whoever is providing the package isn't sending you malware, and furthermore that their security and organizational processes will keep anyone from sending you malware in the future.

It's sort of like trying to make money off of sports betting. You might be able to predict the outcome with *a bit* of accuracy, but there are many unknown factors which are outside of anyone's control. If you are highly skilled and disciplined, then you might be able to make a small consistent profit, but the vast majority of people will make disadvantageous bets and/or expose themselves to an amount of risk that is not sustainable long-term, and will lose money.
Bots are likely to lose money long-term unless you are already a day trading expert and design the bot logic yourself, even if they can (like martingale betting bots) maybe keep themselves going for a while.
As with anything, if it was a low-risk "get rich quick" opportunity, then everyone would do it.

Before his first attempt at claiming to be Satoshi was thoroughly debunked, maybe there was a chance. *Maybe* there was even a chance before his second obvious fraud was debunked. But now he's tried it three times in different ways, and every time his claims were proven to be totally, clearly without merit. The only way that he could actually be Satoshi is if Satoshi was trying to throw people off by intentionally trying to look like someone who was fraudulently trying to steal Satoshi's identity -- but I find this to be so unlikely (why bring any attention onto yourself at all?) that it's hardly worth consideration.

I don't know anything about Gemini in particular, but in general:
Depending on the site, they might ask you for identifying info at some point in the process. Some exchanges will let you deposit and trade without any identity info, but they won't let you withdraw without verifying your identity. (This way of operating is unethical IMO.)
When you place an order, it'll be easiest to just do a market order. That means that you buy whatever BTC is available for the best prices you can get right now. Exchanges will also have limit orders (and sometimes other order types), which actual traders use, but if you're just trying to buy BTC, then using limit orders might cause you to buy less BTC than you'd wanted. If an exchange doesn't offer an explicit market order, a limit order with a price quite a bit above (buying BTC) or below (selling BTC) the current market price will be equivalent on sane exchanges. However, some exchanges charge a higher fee when you are *taking* an order that someone else made (which you always do with a market order) compared to *making* a new order (which limit orders sometimes do, depending on the limit price and the current orderbook).

It's possible. It depends on how quickly LN improves, especially on usability. I think that LN *can* be superior to grin in most ways, but there's a lot of complexity in the implementation and (possibly) usage of the full LN system. I'm very excited about grin as a totally new way of safely scaling a Bitcoin-like system.
The grin currency is a poor store of value, though, so it's unlikely to compete with BTC there. If it does end up out-competing LN, the most likely outcome of that would be a BTC-denominated grin sidechain being created, or *perhaps* we'd end up with an ecosystem where grin is used like a checking account alongside BTC's gold.

Before real trading started, BTC was near-worthless, so most people didn't buy or sell it. People used BTC like monopoly money for little things just for fun. One of the first things you could buy with BTC was stickers from NewLibertyStandard (NLS). NLS also ran a small trading pool prior to the existence of any exchanges: he'd buy and sell BTC, and try to figure out a reasonable price based on supply/demand. In historical price data that goes back as far as possible, the very first BTC prices come from NLS.
The first exchange site was called Bitcoin Market (BCM). It worked a bit like Localbitcoins in that BCM would escrow the BTC side, but the two parties were responsible for settling the non-BTC side between themselves. However, unlike Localbitcoins, BCM had a global orderbook, so orders would be executed automatically when they matched (and then the parties would have to manually settle the order). Even at this time fraud sometimes occurred, so the most liquid currencies on BCM were Liberty Reserve and Pecunix. It's interesting to note that Bitcoin now utterly dominates the market niches once held by Liberty Reserve and Pecunix (even before LR was shut down).
There had been a couple of earlier attempts at exchanges which also held the fiat side, but they went bankrupt due to fraud. When MtGox came around, originally accepting PayPal deposits, I thought it would suffer the same fate. (And it pretty quickly did lose a lot of money due to fraud, though the owner ate the losses.) It's funny that although I didn't much care for the idea of MtGox, and I waited at least a day after its announcement before registering there, I was still MtGox user  -- that shows how incredibly small the community was at this point.
For basically all of Bitcoin's history, I've been surprised at how quickly it grew. Even in the sub-cent era, I thought that Bitcoin would go to the moon someday, but I thought it'd take several years to break $1.

Yeah, Satoshi originally had the idea that you would do literally *everything* via the Bitcoin client. Marketplaces, auctions, escrow, exchanges, etc. So there would be no need for any Bitcoin-accepting websites, really. But this turned out to be way too ambitious, so he eventually gave up on this and started to move toward the current idea of bitcoind being a gateway into the Bitcoin network used by other things.

I'm not an expert in this, but I actually think that for the most part the people inside of ICANN would prefer to remain as independent as possible. They seem to have a pretty pro-freedom, hands-off attitude. One of the previous CEOs of ICANN wrote the book *The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations*, and the current chairman of the board invented the IETF RFC process (which Bitcoin's BIPs are indirectly based off of).
However, all governments except the US have long been clamoring to absorb ICANN into the UN. The fear with removing the US's oversight is that these governments will eventually succeed, either by infiltrating ICANN or maybe through legal means such as by exploiting US antitrust laws in order to threaten ICANN.

If you're *given* a block that is eg. 3.5MB, then you can say that it would've taken about 3.5 pre-SegWit blocks to store those same transactions, so *in that specific case* transaction throughput was multiplied by about 3.5x.
But SegWit's increase of the max block size to ~4MB was not the same as quadrupling transaction throughput *generally* because only witness data can go in the SegWit part, so not all of the 4MB can be used in all cases. I don't know what the current best estimate for real throughput increase assuming full SegWit usage is, but it's somewhere around 2x.
(An inaccurate/FUD argument is "you got only 2x throughput for 4MB blocks", but again, *if* a block is 4MB, then transaction throughput was 4x *for that block*.)

Cobra's posts before and after (but not including) the period when his account was compromised are consistent. Compare posts like these:
* [He thinks that Bitcoin could lose on payments.](
* [He's suspicious of Adam Back.]( ([Also here.](
* [And blockstream.]( ([Also here.](
Furthermore, his attitude is similar to how he's always been, as far as I've known him. He can still sign with his original PGP key. And he continues to [reply intelligently]( to comments.
So I don't think that he sold his account or anything like that.
Now, I don't *agree* with some of his opinions. But I can see how a sane mind could come to Cobra's viewpoints. For example, in the Bcash case:
* LN is over-hyped. There are many huge, unsolved barriers to LN adoption. I predict that it will not be usable by ordinary people for at least a year, and maybe longer.
* There is significant value in using a cryptocurrency for payments, beyond just using one as a store of value.
* If on-chain Bitcoin payments are too expensive, people will use something else.
* One incredibly easy way of "using something else" is to use an altcoin which is [primarily due to its much lower population] cheaper. It's basically a drop-in replacement. [I'd prefer sidechains, which both draw strength from Bitcoin and strengthen Bitcoin, but there is no usable sidechain system now.]
* Bcash is notable, and their community cares about cheap payments. [Even though Bcash's "technology" is a joke, with even ETH having better technology for maintaining cheap payments long-term.]
* Therefore, you could argue that Bcash could out-compete Bitcoin in payments.
Due in part to points I mentioned above, I consider Bcash to be neither interesting nor a threat to Bitcoin in any way at this point. I generally ignore it. But I wouldn't say that everyone who has any support for Bcash is insane or insincere.
I can't assure people that Cobra will never do something evil. I don't know who he is, and on a technical level he has ultimate control over the domain names. But he hasn't done anything evil over the course of several years, and I think he is still the same person, so the risk does not seem high to me. That said, you should always have *plans* for people and sites being compromised.

Looks fake. After high-profile hacks like this, it's very common for others to pretend that they were the ones who hacked the site.
There are better ways to monetize the data. Aside from the obvious uses in various types of fraud, they could probably make hundreds of millions of dollars in ransoms by targeting the affected *individuals*. (Maybe it'd be difficult to contact all of the people, though.) Or they could do something like set the starting ransom at 10k BTC, and then every day release 0.25% of the data and also increase the price by 5%; that'd make a huge media storm which would basically force Equifax to pay (even though you really shouldn't ever pay a leaked-data ransom, since it's unlikely that the ransomer will actually live up to their end of the bargain.).
I *almost* hope that the whole database does end up getting published, since it'd hopefully force the US banking system to not be quite so utterly, amazingly insecure. The US banking system is founded on the idea that it's not worth the trouble to even try attacking most targets (since you can usually succeed if you try), that when attacks do happen, fraudulent transfers can *usually* be reversed, and that when people actually come to harm, *usually* it's too difficult for them to sue the banks. In 99% of cases you can find the info in this hacked database with a bit of work, so the idea that there was any security here was a joke to begin with.  The full release of the database would just make the insecurity more obvious, and reduce the barrier of entry to attack. But if the hackers have any brains, they'll realize that the last thing they want is for it to become widely known that the full database is floating around, since that might actually force changes that would invalidate the database's usefulness. A smart group of hackers would probably either do some ransom scheme, or else sit on the data for a couple of years to lull people into a false sense of security, and then use it for fraud slowly over the course of many years; SSNs don't change, and addresses change only very slowly, so the database will not lose too much of its value over time unless the banking system itself improves (which it won't do without pressure).

He's absolutely wrong about that. (And he's very leftist in general, so it's not surprising that he'd say that.)
I am an anarcho-capitalist, but I am also extremely interested in space exploration. I would donate to a private entity which would do space exploration, and if a number of factors were right, I'd pay to go into space and maybe I'd even pay to join a space colony. Lots of people feel the same, so there's money to be made here by a private enterprise.
It has actually long annoyed me how poorly governments have been doing space exploration/colonization. If you want to see an era of space exploration, then what you really want is *infrastructure*: space elevators or mass drivers to get into space more cheaply, space-based mining and manufacturing, satellites which store large amounts of energy and then transmit it to other craft via lasers, automated transportation craft, etc. Those are the sorts of things that would make a difference long-term and *also* the things that could potentially create a profit. But due to government's disconnection with the market and also the way their budgeting works (ironically focused on the short-term, contrary to what pro-government people tend to say), they spend billions on things like the Juno mission, which are certainly interesting and of scientific value, but not significantly useful if your goal is to expand into space.
Also, even if Bitcoin 100% takes over as the world's currency, it's not going to end governments overnight. Even in that case it'd just be a small push in the right direction.

You can't increase the BTC price by adding more hashrate: that doesn't affect the supply or demand of BTC much at all. Similarly for taking hashrate away, except insofar as it could cause technical issues such as higher fees, though not enough hashrate was removed here to cause any issues. In general, hashrate follows price, not the other way around.
That tweet was just a few hours before the big drop, so probably either:
* Jihan or an ally intentionally crashed the price by selling a lot of BTC into low volume, probably for the purpose of sending a message in order to influence the BCH situation. Exchange depth/volume has been low recently, so it doesn't take all that much money to do this for a little while.
* A whale was spooked by Jihan's tweet.
Keep in mind that this drop was long predicted by technical analysis. Since BTC failed several times to break out of the ~$6k purgatory, some major move seemed inevitable, upward being possible but downward more likely. Jihan's tweet (and maybe his intentional crashing of the price) just lit the fuse.

The Tor whitepaper even says:


threat when analyzing theoretical anonymity designs. But like all practical low-latency systems, Tor does not protect
against such a strong adversary.
When Tor was created in 2004, it was not so unreasonable to assume that nobody was listening to a large portion of Internet traffic. But the Snowden leaks and other similar info makes me think that the US government is collecting essentially all Internet traffic as section 702 data-collection. This breaks Tor completely. Even just wide-scale metadata collection (IP x talks to IP y at time t) breaks Tor completely.
Furthermore, Tor is weak to a wide array of less difficult attacks. I recently talked about a few [here]( and [here]( but there are many, many more.
Why haven't all darknet markets been shut down already, when doing so is almost certainly possible? I suspect that they're striving to make it at least not *obvious* that Tor is transparent to them so that they can do parallel construction on the cases that they *really* care about. And keep in mind that the people with access to this section-702 data will be intelligence agencies, not ordinary law enforcement, so it's not as if just any police officer can go put in an order to get a DNM site unmasked.

Grin's biggest advantage is scaling. With Bitcoin, full nodes have to sync from block 1 until now. The bandwidth and processing power required to do this initial sync is a factor, as is the fact that *someone* has to store and provide the full chain history to new nodes. These are major limiters on scaling. There are various approaches that altcoins have to used to try to ameliorate this problem:
* Many just increase the max block size and hope for the best, and since hardly anyone actually uses them, this usually doesn't actually cause problems. This is like increasing the "max capacity" sign on an airplane without doing anything to actually improve the airplane, relying on the fact that the airplanes are usually run nearly empty, so your rate of crashes doesn't actually increase much.
* Do some blatantly centralized solution such as periodic snapshots/checkpoints.
* Do reduced validation of old data. Some altcoins do this in really insecure ways (eg. ETH by default verifies almost nothing), but even Bitcoin Core by default does only partial validation of old blocks. However, even with minimal validation, new nodes still rely on replaying all of the past history, so a great deal of historical data is still required. And any reduction in validation reduces security, even if in *some* cases you can argue that the reduction in security is minimal.
Grin is the first coin which can near-totally forget historical transaction data in a decentralized and secure manner. Every coffee purchase does *not* need to be remembered by the network forever. As a result, when determining how much transaction volume the network can safely support, you (mostly) only need to look at the costs of *live* transactions, and not how these transactions will create a burden on the network going forward.
Grin also has privacy advantages, but it's similar to (future) LN onion routing in terms of strength and challenges. In both cases, I'd expect there to be years of successful attacks against their anonymization strategies before they become reasonably solid-looking. For now, Monero is probably more private, but even Monero is not a black box, and Monero has no hope of ever safely scaling to significant transaction volumes.

That would be a big problem, and the goal is to avoid that.
There are several possible solutions to initial-sync. One is to allow deterministic builds of the chainstate data (ie. the end product of a pruned node's syncing of the full chain). So in a similar way to how Bitcoin Core's binaries are already deterministically built by several independent parties, anyone could do the full chain sync themselves, PGP-sign a hash of the resulting chainstate, and then someone else could download that version of the chainstate and verify that it was signed by Wladimir, gmaxwell, luke-jr, and whoever else. Currently this isn't possible because every node's chainstate data is different, even if they're synced to the same block. But last I heard, the Core devs are working on deterministic chainstate distribution and loading. These chainstate packages would be distributed only maybe once per year or something, they would only be for initial sync, and they would be optional; in that context, it seems sufficiently decentralized to me.
There are still some as-yet-unsolved problems with that, like the problem of importing a private key with a balance when you're a pruned node, especially if you want anonymity.

Mining is too centralized, and many of the major miners are clearly bad actors. But a PoW change looks like a net negative currently. Calling for a PoW change now is kind of like calling for a block-size increase: you see a problem, and you see a big red button labeled "solve problem", but you fail to look at what the button actually does.
First of all, it's important to recognize that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners. If it was, then Bitcoin would already be lost, since the majority of miners have long been incompetent and/or totally opposed to the ideals of Bitcoin. If miners try any attack, a response can be custom-tailored to it by the economy in order to stop the attack and undo any damage. In case of attack, it would absolutely not be necessary to accept whatever the miners are doing.
Secondly, the major miners (especially Bitmain and associates) are major miners because they have access to high-quality *chip fabrication* technology/infrastructure. If you changed the PoW to eg. SHA-3, this would be a massive *boon* to Bitmain, since they would be in a better position than anyone on Earth to create new hardware.
Thirdly, pure PoS has been totally discredited. A combination PoW+PoS might not be a terrible idea IMO, but the idea is fairly unpopular among experts for technical and philosophical reasons.
Finally, it's easy to *say* that you want to create an "ASIC-proof" PoW function, but doing so is much more difficult. Recall that "democratizing mining" was one of the goals of Litecoin's usage of scrypt, but Bitmain is now producing Litecoin ASICs. X11 was another attempt at an ASIC-proof PoW, and ASICs were produced for that one as soon as the altcoins which used it became valuable enough to make doing so profitable. You can think up whatever ultra-complex, apparently-CPU-unique thing you want, but:
 * *Probably* you will fail to create something that actually requires a true CPU rather than some more-efficient-than-CPUs ASIC, as doing so is very difficult. (To do so would require attacking the problem rigorously &amp; mathematically, not just willy-nilly doing things that look hard for ASICs.)
 * If you somehow do create one, congrats: you've now given a monopoly on Bitcoin mining hardware to Intel and (to a much lesser extent) AMD, the only two companies with the technology for creating efficient x86 CPUs.
 
There's been some research on creating a memory-hard PoW function rather than a CPU-hard function, but this is an experimental area. The best candidate function we have, cuckoo, is not *proven* to be memory-hard (ie. maybe more analysis could someday allow for eliminating the memory-hardness). Furthermore, even if we had a well-tested and proven memory-hard PoW, it is not clear that this would result in less mining centralization. Maybe the economies of scale would end up even *more* pronounced here, or maybe mining would be taken over by a couple of giant botnets. (I actually think that this is the most promising direction for solving mining centralization long-term, but there are serious questions and challenges which probably won't be well-addressed anytime soon.)
 
So my position has been and continues to be that:
1. The PoW should absolutely be changed if miners do any sort of attack (the most likely of which is censoring "dubious" transactions rather than anything more obviously evil). In that scenario, the miners must be fired or Bitcoin is dead, so a high-cost, risky PoW change is worthwhile. And if the first PoW change fails to keep those miners away, you keep changing the PoW until they've created so many ASIC paperweights that they've run out of money.
2. While I would *like* to replace the current miners, in the absence of any attack, a PoW change is a high-cost, high-risk move which is unlikely to actually improve things in the long-run anyway. It's not worth it.

You're thinking of the input. A Bitcoin address specifies the output of the sender's transaction, and then the recipient spends it by using a specific input scriptSig.
Here are the standard SegWit patterns from the perspective of spending a segWit output.
Pattern name | Address pattern | scriptSig | prev-out scriptPubKey
P2SH(WPKH) | 3... | `0x160014&lt;20 bytes&gt;` | `0xA914&lt;20 bytes&gt;87`
P2SH(WSH) | 3... | `0x220020&lt;32 bytes&gt;` | `0xA914&lt;20 bytes&gt;87`
P2WPKH | bc1... (short) | (empty) | `0x0014&lt;20 bytes&gt;`
P2WSH | bc1... (long) | (empty) | `0x0020&lt;32 bytes&gt;`
In this case, the transaction's output matches the third "prev-out scriptPubKey" pattern, so you know that it's a P2WPKH with a bc1... (short) address, and when it's spent it'll have an empty scriptSig (with the actual signatures in the witness).
The first and second patterns can't be distinguished from non-SegWit P2SH until spent. Once spent, you have to check *both* of the right two columns in my table.

There's ~no technical difference between 51% and 100%, and BitMain has been dangerously close to or arguably above 51% for a long time.


The primary problem is that attacks *can* be done by attackers with a lot of mining power. If there were no attacks that miners could do, then it wouldn't be a problem at all for 100% of mining power to be held by one entity; that wouldn't be a relevant sort of centralization.
You can look at the current situation in a similar way as the above paragraph: while miners can do a lot of damage, as long as the economy has the ability to change the PoW upon any attack by miners, *fatal* attacks (ie. attacks which are never resolved) cannot be done by miners. So if you only care about fatal attacks, it's not a problem at all for 100% of mining power to be held by one entity; it's not a relevant sort of centralization from that perspective. Of course, less-than-fatal attacks are still extremely important, but it's important to recognize that domination of mining power does not imply domination of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, compare these two scenarios:
 * The US government has reason to hate Bitcoin, and they have nearly unlimited resources when compared to the Bitcoin ecosystem. They could do a mining-based attack against Bitcoin at any time.
 * BitMain has proven themselves to be opposed to the ideals of Bitcoin, and they have a concerningly-high amount of mining power. They could maybe do a mining-based attack against Bitcoin at any time.
 
Now, they're not exactly the same because BitMain is probably much more *likely* to attack Bitcoin in the near future, but what I'm trying to say is that the existence of powerful attackers who can damage the system, while **very bad**, does not make the system centralized in the same way that eg. Tor directory authorities make Tor centralized. It's like how Freenet and I2P are weak against powerful attackers who can control many more IP addresses than the legitimate network. And just as with those networks, we don't have solid solutions that don't come with massive trade-offs, so we live with the risk and stand prepared to respond to possible attacks reactively.
Evenly distributing mining power is actually a less-than-ideal solution, since it still opens up the possibility that some powerful entity (like a government) will get through whatever mechanism was trying to ensure even mining-power distribution. It'd be better for this sort of power to not exist at all, but that's probably more difficult to achieve than "acceptable distribution in most circumstances", especially if you don't want to change Bitcoin too much.




In that kind of life-or-death scenario, you just do it, within days. You don't waste much time on consensus-building. A split Bitcoin is incredibly bad, but it's not as bad as a dead/totally-corrupted Bitcoin.
The above two points are why I've previously discussed building consensus on an exact set of criteria for what would constitute an attack by miners. You might even present this document to users of Bitcoin software at first-run so that everyone is on the same page. But there wasn't much interest when I was working on it last.


I agree that this is a good goal. In fact, I've proposed [one hybrid PoW scheme]( and one [totally different cryptocurrency architecture]( aimed at addressing the problem of powerful miner attackers. But the fact is that we're a long way off from anything being even *theoretically* solid. If for some reason there was overwhelming consensus for a PoW change of some sort, but there also wasn't much of a hurry, we might still end up with SHA-3 even despite its well-known sub-optimality just because we're so far from agreement on whether any of the more promising alternatives wouldn't end up being worse. If you ask 20 Bitcoin experts how the miner problem should be addressed, you'll get ~20 different answers, and some people totally despise some of the most promising solutions.
If widespread agreement existed that there *was* some safe way to remove the miner threat, then I would support it. But we're very far from that now, and if for example there erupted a UASF-like movement to change the PoW ASAP, this would just create a mess and likely make things worse in the end, since there *is no* good solution to rally around currently.

If you invested more than you could afford to lose, and you can't deal with it dropping more, then selling now may be prudent. A lot of people *think* that it will rise again soon, but that's speculation, and it very well *could* drop much more from even the current price.
If you didn't invest more than you could afford to lose, I'd personally be reluctant to accept such losses. But you have to be prepared for the *possibility* of a long wait. In 2014 the price stagnated at around $200 for a whole year after attaining massive ATHs in 2013, for example. People who bought in at the 2013 ATH only broke even if they held until 2017. Bitcoin is not a magic machine where you put money in and get more money out with no risk, regardless of how it's looked for the last several months.
To avoid the sunk-cost fallacy, it may be helpful to think in these terms: Your money is already gone; where you had x\*$17000, now you have x\*$7000. Imagine that you have that sitting in your bank account. In those circumstances, would you buy BTC now, or not? (Investment advisors often give this example, though admittedly it's difficult to actually do...)

You could have someone accept payments on your behalf, but that's far from ideal. Not only is there opportunity for theft, but there are big issues of privacy, centralization, legal impediments, transaction censorship (cf. BitPay banning adult sites), etc.
The payment channels used by LN are an interactive protocol reminiscent of Diffie–Hellman key exchange: the sender and recipient need to send data back and forth several times, performing computations using their private keys at each step. If someone does your end for you, then they have your private key and can spend your BTC in the channel. There's no way to pre-authorize certain actions or anything like that, even using smart contracts. Maybe someone will figure out some clever workaround at some point, but with current tech, if you or your absolutely-trusted agent are not online, you're not receiving LN payments.

I've been feeling for a long time that a big chunk of the price is supported only weakly. Keep in mind that earlier *this year*, the price was under $1000. If the stars (mis)align so that speculators mostly become short BTC, I suspect that strong, fundamentals-driven resistance won't be seen until $1500 or so.
If China actually does ban all of the major Chinese exchanges, that'll be a big short-term downward force. Most people in China who currently own BTC will want to sell their BTC before the deadline. It'll still be *possible* to sell BTC in China after that, both legally and extra-legally, but it'll be a lot more difficult. If Sep 30 is the deadline, then I'd expect a downtrend with a low point on Sep 30, and shortly afterward a partial recovery as a lot of people (*including* some Chinese people who are willing to jump through hoops) come in to "buy the dip". If I had to throw out a wild guess, I'd say $1900 on Oct 1 and $2500 a month later *if* all major Chinese exchanges shut down trading on Sep 30.
Personally, I'm not currently planning on making large trades in any direction, though.

A nuclear EMP irreversibly destroys power/Internet infrastructure and most electronic equipment within line-of-sight of the nuclear explosion. A single bomb intended to destroy a city will have localized EMP effects, but a scattering of high-altitude explosions could leave the entire US without electricity for months (or longer if society collapses), since ~everything electronic would have to be repaired or rebuilt. Obviously, Bitcoin would be useless in affected regions, and if this happened in any developed country, I'd expect the BTC price to crash globally, since everyone would fear being similarly affected.
A widespread EMP strike is probably far outside of the DPRK's capabilities, however. (China or Russia could do it, though.)
In these circumstances, you leave "investing/finance" and enter "survivalism".  If you think that the risk-benefit analysis shows that preparations are warranted, then you'd want to stockpile things like water, long-shelf-life food, physical gold/silver, ammunition, etc. BTC, USD, exchange-traded things, etc. would be worthless in these scenarios.

Addresses are only for human consumption. They don't *actually* exist on the network. In this case, bc.i is interpreting a native SegWit output as its bech32 address before any wallets actually support such addresses. The consensus rules for native SegWit were part of the SegWit deployment, and don't require an additional softfork.
We probably won't see general usage of bech32 addresses for over a year, I'd guess, though for forward compatibility Core will probably add support for sending *to* bech32 addresses fairly soon.

Bitcoin's P2P is very easy to block. Simply blocking port 8333 would seriously degrade performance, and just a tiny bit more work could finish the job. Bitcoin P2P traffic can be trivially identified by the 4-byte magic, or even just by enumerating all listening nodes (by design very easy) and blocking them.
The philosophy of Bitcoin's P2P network is that preventing this kind of thing is outside of Bitcoin's scope, and any obfuscation/anonymization should be done on a separate layer. For example, Bitcoin traffic can flow through Tor+obfsproxy, which is sometimes able to bypass the GFW.
Although it is not at all exploited in today's P2P network, Bitcoin has a huge theoretical advantage when it comes to evading this kind of thing because you only need to sync with a single universal database in order to be a full node, and then in order to send transactions you just need to send a tiny amount of data. It's much better than things like Tor, which need point-to-point connections to *specific* servers. With Bitcoin, you can have any number of mostly-independent/cut-off mirrors, so it is far easier to design an alternative Bitcoin P2P network on top of distributed data stores like Freenet/GNUnet, or on WiFi mesh networks, satellite broadcasts, etc. For those who aren't mining, it's not a big problem for latency to be high, as well. So far there's been very little work on this kind of thing beyond theory because there hasn't been much need/demand, but if China blocks Bitcoin, that'll change.

Trying to glean any truth from CSW's ramblings is a waste of time...
Long-term, pruning might reduce the number of online full copies of the whole history from 50k to 1k or something. It's not a centralization/trust problem, since pruning is trustless. Possibly it could cause a lack of block sources if pruning is very widespread, slowing full syncing. That's why it's not enabled by default. But there are several ideas for fixing that properly.
There is no special "SegWit pruning" in the current code. SegWit transactions are pruned exactly the same way as non-SegWit transactions: everything is kept for recent blocks, and once they expire, only the chainstate-database entries are kept. Maybe a new pruning mode will be added at some point to prune just the witness data (this would have the advantage of allowing nodes so pruned to still rescan); if for some *completely unimaginable* reason there are legal problems with that, then you just shouldn't do it.
Their whole argument regarding legal issues with segregating signatures is nonsensical, though; there's no change in the level of commitment between pre-SegWit and SegWit transactions. Pre-SegWit, you can take a transaction, malleate its signature data, and put it in a block. Any malleated version of the transaction is valid, but the specific version of the transaction which ends up in a block can be considered canonical after a while if you wish. Post-SegWit, you can take a transaction, change its witness data in a way which keeps is valid, and put it in a block. Any valid witness is OK, but the specific version of the witness which ends up in the block can be considered canonical. The witness can be considered separate *both* pre-segwit and post-segwit, since you can take it out, change it, and put it back in in both cases. Pre-SegWit, the signature is committed-to over several indirect layers like blockHash -&gt; header -&gt; merkle-tree node 1 -&gt; merkle-tree node 2 -&gt; ... -&gt; txid -&gt; scriptSig. Post-SegWit, the signature is committed-to over several indirect layers like blockHash -&gt; header -&gt; merkle-tree node 1 -&gt; ... -&gt; coinbase txid -&gt; witness commitment -&gt; wtxid-tree node 1 -&gt; wtxid-tree node 2 -&gt; ... -&gt; wtxid -&gt; witness. More layers are added, but it's the same thing, with no loss of validity/security. It has **never** been the case that blocks are one big indivisible chunk; it's a tree structure (see bitcoin.pdf page 4), and whole branches of the tree can be broken off if desired (which is how SPV and pruning work).

Where you'll actually learn programming is *after* your book/course, while you're doing the things that actually interest you. So figure out what you want to do, and learn the language that seems most popular/appropriate for that. Most programming languages are pretty similar, and computer science concepts are universal, so once you know one language really well, you'll be 95% of the way toward learning any other.
For new programmers, Python is IMO the best combination of easiness and usefulness, and you can do plenty of Bitcoin-related things with Python. For example, it's really easy to play around with crypto in Python. But if you're interested in working on *Bitcoin Core* in particular, you might want to learn C++ instead, which Bitcoin Core is written in. C++ is harder to learn than other languages, but a decent book or course will make up for that with increased length rather than increased effort/pain. For C++, make sure you get a book written in the last few years, since old versions of the language have a vastly different style than newer versions.
I recommend learning from a textbook or an online course, not from little tutorials. There are often a lot of free online textbooks for this stuff.

The $600 limit is nice, but 1099-B reporting does not make sense. With a brokerage firm, a 1099-B mainly reflects securities that were both purchased and sold within the same brokerage firm. While possible, it is uncommon to transfer securities from one brokerage firm to another, preserving the cost basis. And it is impossible for an individual to take personal control over exchange-traded things, transferring out of one brokerage firm but not into another brokerage firm. But both of these cases are extremely common with Bitcoin. So unless someone is exclusively using one centralized wallet like Coinbase, any gains reported on a 1099-B generated by Coinbase **will** be wrong. And it could be wrong in either direction: either under-reporting gains or over-reporting gains.

I like this analogy (I got it from some video, don't remember which one): Imagine that there is an unimaginably huge wall with 2^256 lockers. The lockers are unlocked, but you have to take the effort of opening the door in order to access the contents. To store your bitcoins, you choose a random locker and put your bitcoins there. You know exactly where your locker is, so you can easily find it and get your bitcoins again. But if someone wants to steal your bitcoins (or anyone's), they have to search through all of the lockers. There are so many lockers that this search is simply infeasible: even if all of human computing was dedicated to the task, it would take decades on average to come across a locker that anyone had ever used at any point in time.
If each locker is the size of a grain of sand, and the lockers are on a flat square, then a wall with 2^256 lockers would be far larger than the observable universe.
(Though in Bitcoin, due to the way addresses work, each locker in the above analogy actually has a magic portal connecting it to about 2^96 random other lockers. So there are actually "only" 2^160 distinct locker spaces. Also, if the public key is known, then the attack difficulty is reduced to O(2^(128)) classical operations, and becomes plausible in reality [given sufficiently large quantum computers](

Someone on the network (maybe the recipient of this transaction) is automatically rebroadcasting your transaction.

Yes, that's called pruning. It's been supported in Bitcoin Core for a long time. I think that it was even added to the GUI in recent versions. Pruned nodes **are** full nodes, with maximum security; they're just a bit less helpful to the network.
There are additional theoretical ways to be between a full node and an SPV-style node. The most obvious way, which will probably be supported in Bitcoin Core at some point as an option, is to somehow get the current state of the network (ie. the "balances") without downloading the entire transaction history, and then work as a full node from that point. You're trusting the initial-state database, but since it's only a one-time risk, if for example these are signed by multiple independent people in a similar way to Bitcoin Core releases, it may be a reasonable compromise that people could choose to take. Your node could also do this just to start with, and then double-check it in the background over a long period of time.
Another possibility would be true SPV. Today's "SPV" wallets do **not** follow the description of SPV in the original whitepaper, which called for SPV nodes being able to receive cryptographic proof that a given block was invalid (from full-node peers), and then reject that block even if it was in the longest chain. That'd be much more secure than today's SPV-style wallets which just blindly trust the longest chain.

Even if there weren't any particular warning signs, it seems like a bad idea to use USDT. It's an unsecured loan to some no-name company, and they don't even pay interest. If some micro-cap company with no credit rating tried to sell a 0-interest, uninsured, unsecured bond, they'd be laughed out of the room.
I suppose this kind of thing theoretically fills a niche for active traders who want to take a short position on cryptocoins generally, but the exchange doesn't want to deal with USD. But IMO it'd be better for such exchanges to just deal in derivatives in that case (like deribit and a couple of others).

First: Bitcoin only checks the hashes of the last 2500 blocks (and their transactions) unless you run it with -checkblocks.
Second: Bitcoin never re-checks the *relationships* between blocks or transactions. So if the attacker modifies a block such that it is internally consistent, it won't be noticed even by -checkblocks when it breaks other rules (such as too-low difficulty, breaking the chain, containing an invalid transaction, etc.).

No, it's the natural result of B2X lacking replay protection. BitMEX is continuing operations without any changes, and the stupid design of B2X causes the B2X coins to be lost. It's like someone throwing gold coins at a moving train, and the passengers complaining because the train didn't stop to collect the coins. It isn't really reasonable to demand that companies must diverge from what they're already doing and:
* Extensively test new software
* Stop trading/withdrawals/deposits for a while
* Access cold-storage coins and perform an unusual procedure on them
* Modify the software to withdraw a brand new token, when the site doesn't even support that many tokens as-is
* Deal with the risk of people withdrawing to the wrong address type (since B2X has the same address format as Bitcoin)
* Etc.
Now, I agree that it would be *nice* for them to do those things. It's better for people to have B2X (and sell them) than for the B2X to just get randomly lost. But I don't think that BitMEX's position is at all *unreasonable*, and it's definitely not equivalent to theft. People deposited BTC, and they'll get BTC back. BTC does not inherently pay these "altcoin dividends": that's an ugly, unsupported hack, and if you want it, you have to make your own preparations.

When spending BTC sent to an address starting with 1, and sending to an address starting from 1, the size is 192 or 191 bytes. Your transaction does **not** do that. Your transaction spends BTC sent to a *2-of-2 multisig*, which is always larger. [Here]( is an example of a non-SegWit transaction similar to yours.
SegWit transactions are currently *slightly* larger in real size (ie. ignoring weight): 2 bytes per transaction, plus 1 byte per SegWit input, plus 23 bytes per P2SH-wrapped WPKH input or 35 bytes per P2SH-wrapped WSH input. Almost all of this could be compressed away with a software change not even requiring a softfork/hardfork, but the increase is pretty negligible, so it hasn't been done yet.

A Bitcoin private key is just a 256-bit number. You can generate an infinite number of deterministic but unpredictable/"random" numbers by hashing a seed. An illustration:
    sha256("mnemonic: correct horse battery staple | usage: Bitcoin | key 123")
    	= c11f1f62135b793b784ee0d3c6c0e237513ffd7047b01fc6eb44a5726e16810f
    sha256("mnemonic: correct horse battery staple | usage: Bitcoin | key 124")
    	= 50c2ab773b121cb18fc8fa5c68f4bdfb171e2dc3b0ff30de291412e33c839a7d
    sha256("mnemonic: correct horse battery staple | usage: Monero | key 123")
    	= b9836adae84a9c97a92e4faf9134762be5e363ac2d70eb4077c70e5654e42982
You just use each SHA-256 output as private keys in this example. (But don't actually use my example method to generate keys.)
How wallets actually do it is somewhat different from the above example, but it's the same sort of idea.


It'll generate like 100 keys or something, and if any of them have ever been used (according to whatever source of transaction data your wallet uses), then it continues generating more until it has the target number of unused keys and it can guess that it's reached the end.
If you actually have a large gap of unused keys, then that doesn't mean that you'll lose your money or anything, though you might have to do some manual work to make your wallet search further into the list of keys.

* Could the maximum transaction throughput and/or maximum block size be further increased with additional softforks: Yes, though it wouldn't be straightforward.
* Would increasing the SegWit discount increase the maximum transaction throughput: Not very much. SegWit can only discount the witness data, so there are diminishing returns. Changing the SegWit discount so that witness data was free is possible, but it would increase throughput only a little, and you couldn't go further than that. And it'd be dangerous to do that, since it'd be possible to create massive blocks with tons of witness data.


Bitcoin is not run by Core, or miners, or a democracy, or anyone. Bitcoin *is not governed*. Each Bitcoin user has complete individual sovereignty, as long as they don't give this up by trusting others.

It's pretty funny how that one developed. Project Chanology was originally envisioned as an attempt to troll the apparently-very-gullible Scientologists into believing some sort of additional hilarious make-believe nonsense -- a new "Chanology" religion. But in trying to raid/troll Scientology, the trolls accidentally started an actual movement. The way that the "Anonymous group" was portrayed during Chanology was a mish-mash of vague 4chan culture, a desire to push certain themes as propaganda, and a desire to create an enemy of Scientology which was somewhat similar to evil organizations in Scientology mythology; "Anonymous" as portrayed never actually existed except in broad strokes, but outsiders actually believed it and ran with it.

"Settlement" makes it sound like we decentralists want to turn Bitcoin into a wire-transfer system or something where everyone's going to pay $50 per transaction. That's not what we want. From an end-user perspective, I want instant transactions, negligibly-low fees (a few USD cents or less), perfect anonymity, and (most importantly) a very high degree of decentralization. None of this is going to happen with on-chain transactions:
First, block chains require a wait time between blocks. Even if the block time was reduced to 1 minute (which is probably unsafely fast), you'd still quite often get blocks which take tens of minutes due to the randomness in this process. That's totally unacceptable for point-of-sale situations, and even 1 minute is pushing it.
Second, block chains store data forever, which works against anonymity, and currently-known anonymization schemes (eg. the schemes used in zcash or Monero) are extremely big/slow/expensive.
Third, block chains are *broadcast* systems, which just doesn't scale. A comparison can be made to early Ethernet networks, which worked by tapping multiple computers into a single Ethernet line and then having everyone just broadcast to the line. It's simple and it works on small scales, but you're not going to build the Internet (or even somewhat-large networks) by having everyone broadcast to a single medium; you can't expect clients to sort through gigabytes of traffic per second to find what they want. The Internet uses layers of interconnected networks to solve this, so that people only deal with traffic that they need. Similarly, you're not going to build a scalable money system by having everyone broadcast their transactions to every other participant as Bitcoin does now. (Bitcoin is even worse than Internet networks because each participant needs to verify and store transactions, not just download them.) One way to solve this is to centralize: if everyone's trusting a small handful of entities (eg. miners and/or huge exchanges), then you can have them invest in ultra-powerful servers and split the data apart for clients, and on net you end up with a very cheap system. But that defeats the main purpose of Bitcoin, which is not to be uniquely fast or cheap money (though those are good to have), but to be uniquely *decentralized* and trustless money. So in Bitcoin we need to find other ways to avoid broadcasting every transaction to every user.
One way is Lightning, which trustlessly keeps transactions localized to certain pseudo-communities. LN works very similarly to the Internet, in fact. If LN doesn't work out for whatever reason, there are many other possible solutions which are talked about less often nowadays; for example, you can have a network of sidechains which are automatically created by the system to meet demand and expire after a while to remove old data, and then route payments amonst all of the sidechains. Or you can combine centralized entities with a decentralized base block chain in order to get centralized-but-trustless systems like TumbleBit.
I hope and predict that the main chain will on average have vaguely low fees (less than a few dollars) in the future, though I've heard some other experts give higher predictions. But anyway, even $1 is an annoying fee. The goal is for most people to experience Bitcoin as having instant transactions and negligible fees, regardless of the on-chain fees. This will have to be done via off-chain systems unless you're abandoning trustlessness/decentralization. But my idea of Bitcoin 10 years from now is not people fumbling with multiple off-chain and on-chain systems: rather, their wallet will look as it does now, and it'll take care of that for them. I want people to experience a Bitcoin that's *even better* than 2010's Bitcoin where you could easily send money quickly and cheaply with only a few clicks. Bigblockers seem to want to return to exactly that, but it's just not going to happen without centralization or a multi-layered system: that was possible *only* because Bitcoin was super small, like the example of Ethernet networks on a single line.

It's not impossible to pay off, but it'd require very significant cuts, which is probably *politically* impossible. There's a little game [here]( where you can try your hand at cutting.
The current course is totally unsustainable, and I don't think there'll be the political will to really fix anything until it's far too late. IMO the US will eventually either explicitly declare bankruptcy by defaulting on some or all of its bonds (mostly held by Americans...), or it'll print money to the point of hyperinflation. But because of the US's relatively strong position, this game could still go on for quite a while: I wouldn't be surprised if there's no major debt crisis for 15 years or more.

The 21 million limit is a result of the [GetBlockSubsidy]( function. It probably doesn't make a good screenshot for public consumption because `consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval` (=210000) is defined in a separate file, and you also need to know how the C++ operators work in order to understand the function. It's not at all *complicated*, but it requires the somewhat niche knowledge that eg. in C++ `/` means "divide and round toward zero" when both operands are integers.
Anyway, GetBlockSubsidy returns the subsidy allowed for each block. For the first 210000 blocks it returns 50, then for the next 210000 blocks it returns 25, and it continues halving. So the total BTC is:
    210000*50 + 210000*50/2 + 210000*50/4 + ...
    = 210000*50 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...)
That's a convergent geometric series. Even as the number of blocks goes to infinity, and even if you assume infinite BTC precision, the sum never reaches a certain value:
    = 210000*50 * (1/2^0 + 1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 + ...)
    = 210000*50 * (sum 1/2^n, n=0 to infinity)
    = 210000*50 * 2
    = 21000000
In the current system, precision is limited, so coins stop being created in about a hundred years. If Bitcoin was changed so that precision was unlimited, coins could continue to be mined forever, but 21 million would still never be reached. In a convergent geometric series, you get constantly closer to the limit, but never reach it in finite time.

You misunderstand. S2X will split off into a separate altcoin, possibly with some people fraudulently labeling it as "Bitcoin". The Core devs will not support that altcoin, but will continue to support Bitcoin. So in the worst-case scenario, you'll have Bitcoin permanently split in two, with some big exchanges on one side and the Core devs, bitcoin.org, etc. on the other side. We're not going to *give up*.
The worst-case split that I described would be the most catastrophic event in Bitcoin history. You'll have a big chunk of the economy running without technical expertise and with the broken/insecure assumption that [Bitcoin is ruled by miners]( and the rest of us would have to build up much of the economy again to replace what was lost. On the bright side, it'd be nice to have these poisonous companies out of the way, and many of the major people on the non-S2X side participated in building up Bitcoin from nothing to begin with, so we have experience. It'd be funny if they fraudulently call their currency Bitcoin but always have to say "but don't visit Satoshi's original bitcoin.org site, that's the *other* Bitcoin". But far better to avoid all of this if possible; what a mess that'd be.

Also, as long as you're not killed by a nuclear explosion, it *is* possible to survive all-out nuclear war.

Most people would end up dying from dehydration/starvation or radiation sickness from fallout after a few weeks, but both are preventable.

I also think that it is in some ways unfortunate that most people are focusing entirely on LN rather than other methods of fast &amp; cheap off-chain payments like hub-and-spoke, federated sidechains, or blinded bearer certificates. While LN is the most decentralized off-chain solution that's been proposed AFAIK, it's also by far the most complicated. Even though you can *sort of* use it now, I'm not so sure that we're going to be seeing ordinary people using it regularly in the next year. And even if we do, it'll only be to pay established merchants, since no solution has yet been devised for LN payments where the recipient is offline; in practice, this will prevent peer-to-peer LN payments (eg. forum trades) from being practical.
LN will probably be the *long-term* solution to Bitcoin payments, but in the short-term I've long advocated for federated sidechains, which could be an ultra-simple drop-in replacement for on-chain Bitcoin transactions, or blinded bearer certificates, which immediately provide perfect anonymity as a side benefit. Both of them are much simpler than LN on a theoretical level, though both have the cost vs LN of increased centralization. I was really hoping that RSK would provide a federated sidechain usable for fast &amp; cheap payments in this way, but so far I've been disappointed there. And nobody is working on blinded bearer certificates AFAIK.

That's not much of an attack; it's basically using the BitTorrent DHT as it was designed. I would tend to just assume that you can download the whole DHT. BitTorrent's DHT isn't especially designed for privacy or anything. And on most P2P networks (including Bitcoin, I2P, and Freenet), it's easy to get a list of all participants.

It's really ridiculous that you commonly have two people working 8+ hours a day in order to support a family, when hundreds of years ago it was fairly common (though not universal) for just one person to support a family. Given the massive technological advances, we *should* live in a world where the average person only needs to work a few hours per day in order to have the same standard of living as 100 years ago, but in reality it seems that things may have gotten *worse*. Some of this is due to an increasingly empty and consumption-driven culture, but probably the main cause is governments sucking up more and more economic activity (either directly or indirectly via regulations) for very little gain; I'd guess that in the US 50-75% of the entire economy goes to the government in one way or another. And almost all of this is either wasted or used to enrich people closest to government such as the lawyers, bankers, etc. that you mentioned; government is the  cause of increasing income inequality, with Washington DC having the highest median income of anywhere in the US.
The solution is to substantially reduce government. Bitcoin is an important piece in this, since it helps agorism and could effectively remove the government's power to employ the "inflation tax", but more work beyond just Bitcoin will be required. In the technology space, I'd especially like to see more work on anonymity -- Tor, Freenet, etc. are nowhere near sufficient for serious use.

This is kind of off-topic for this thread, but just FYI: When you mine at a pool, how it works is that you mine the current block at a much lower difficulty. You frequently solve these low-difficulty blocks and submit them to the pool; each solved one is called a "share". Based on how many shares you've submitted, you can easily calculate how much you should be paid; oftentimes the algorithm is just `TINY_BTC_AMOUNT * SHARES_SUBMITTED` (called PPS). So the pool can't really cheat in the way you describe.

Excellent answer. A couple of extra thoughts:
First, banks' function of storing wealth will probably still be necessary for 99% of people, at least for a long time. Bitcoin famously allows you to "be your own bank", but most people *and businesses* are not competent enough to do that. So as much as I dislike it, I'd expect to see a lot of Bitcoin banks just for securely storing wealth even in the case of a worldwide "Bitcoin standard". And some might even be fractional reserve in order to provide interest on BTC deposits. Maybe eventually security will be made easy enough that everyone can trustlessly store their BTC easily and reliably, but IMO we're a *very* long way off from that.
Second, because BTC is *highly* deflationary, probably moreso even than gold, you'd expect interest rates to be very high. Perhaps this would in fact slow down lending activities a lot.

You showed where Bitcoin's JSON-RPC *does* convert values to/from doubles. I didn't say that Bitcoin used doubles everywhere, just that it uses them, and that this is safe.
When I was still nervous about using doubles for values in 2011, I [rewrote ValueFromAmount]( so that it worked with strings instead of doubles. But then (as you'll see in that linked thread) Gavin discovered that Bitcoin amounts always fit in a double, and I learned that this was unnecessary.
Doubles can be used as a perfectly-precise 53-bit unsigned integer. That is, storing any integer value from 0 to 2^53 in a double is guaranteed to give you the same integer when you access the double again. It turns out that this is sufficient for storing any possible Bitcoin value as the number of satoshi. As such, Bitcoin Core *could* use doubles instead of int64s everywhere for storing Bitcoin values. But this would be slower and more error-prone, so it isn't done. Doing this *is* very convenient in languages with no built-in int64 type, though. If you're hacking together your own large integer type to avoid using doubles for Bitcoin values, you're wasting time.
Doubles also have a field for "where to put the binary point". Given a double containing an integer amount of satoshi, you can always losslessly modify it to "move the decimal point to the right 8 places" to get a BTC amount. This is lossless because you can always convert back to the original value, but the resulting double often does not exactly equal the input value, so additional rounding steps are required. So it's perfectly safe to store Bitcoin amounts in a double, though rounding will be required on input/output. However, doing math (including comparisons) on such values is tricky and should not normally be done until after converting to satoshi like `round($btc_amount * 100000000)` and then sticking to integer math.

I mentioned that, but it has to be according to some objective formula like "constant 2% per year". From the perspective of mainstream economics, this is still problematic because this monetary inflation schedule may be too high or too low considering economic conditions.


Its value can be known *to you*, or to anyone else, but not to the decentralized system itself. Prices are determined by transactions, and the system itself only understands/sees half of each transaction. If I trade 1 coin for $1, then the system sees that I sent 1 coin somewhere, but it doesn't understand the $1 side. Since fiat is fundamentally centralized, trying to tie the currency into that side so that it does fully understand the value of each transaction (and therefore the currency price) requires centralization: you have to connect the system to a trusted exchange, or have a "cryptocurrency-central-bank" survey the ecosystem periodically, or have some system of voting (which is still centralization), etc. Decentralized exchanges wouldn't solve it, either: because neither the currency nor the decentralized exchange *itself* understands the fiat end of each transaction, it doesn't know that each transaction *actually* occurred (ie. that fiat changed hands), so it can't securely trust transaction histories to build a price.
As long as the thing on the other side of the transaction is not itself a decentralized cryptocurrency, it's the same. If you want to price coins in terms of apples instead of dollars, you still have the problem of the system not being able to understand/see/survey the apple end of each transaction.

It's pretty simple. Transactions can specify a LockTime. The transaction isn't valid before that time. If a miner tries to include the transaction in a block before then, everyone will reject the block. So you create a transaction to your beneficiary that becomes valid in 1 year, say, and give this to the beneficiary. This transaction can't actually be *used* until it becomes valid. At any time before then, you can spend any of the inputs to the time-locked transaction. This makes the time-locked transaction invalid forever because using it would be a double-spend. If you fail to invalidate the time-locked transaction before its LockTime, then the beneficiary can broadcast it and it works like any normal transaction.
Currently there's no way to create a time-locked transaction using Bitcoin Core directly, though you can create a raw transaction with Bitcoin Core, manually mess with the bytes to add a lock time and change at least one input sequence number, and then have Bitcoin Core sign it. (Keep in mind that the lock time of a transaction is ignored if all of its input sequences are UINT_MAX.)
Oftentimes, doing this sort of inheritance thing is very difficult currently because actually using any of the money that would be sent to the beneficiary invalidates the time-locked transaction. This could be improved by creating a new feature/protocol that issues a new time-locked transaction and somehow sends it to the beneficiary (or to a third-party that will eventually give it to the beneficiary) whenever you spend any money. Currently, the best way to handle inheritance is probably to use a [proper multi-key paper wallet]( and give the mnemonic to the beneficiary upon your death in the same way you'd give them gold or other physical things.

No, they can't. 0.8 accidentally created a hardfork by breaking an unknown rule in 0.7 and earlier. The older versions clearly had wrong and unintended behavior, but even the core devs and several huge miners put together *could not* force this hardfork through because a hardfork requires ~every user of Bitcoin to upgrade. Instead, miners running 0.8 had to change behavior in order to create valid 0.7 blocks again. This really demonstrates the strength of Bitcoin's decentralization.

These particular repo operations are unusual, but the Fed is *constantly* printing money. This is how they price-fix the cost of money (ie. the short-term interest rate). In particular:
 * The Fed prints money to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER) deposited with the Fed by banks. Currently, the Fed is printing money to pay 1.8% interest on $1.6 trillion in reserves (excess+required).
 * The Fed prints money to pay interest on overnight reverse repo transactions (ON RRP), which has similar effects to IOER. Every day, [billions of dollars in ON RRP transactions take place](
 * The Fed previously printed trillions of dollars in order to buy Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in the quantitative easing (QE) program. Currently they still hold $3.8 trillion in these securities, and whenever one matures, they use the proceeds to buy a replacement. So the effects of the massive money-printing isn't being undone.

The target block interval needs to be high enough that the latency between each miner (including block processing time) is insignificant in comparison. Otherwise the orphan rate is too high, and only the most powerful geographical group of miners with low latency between its members can profitably mine. If it gets particularly bad, you might constantly fail to converge on one longest chain, and things would completely fall apart.
Related: 
I suppose that 10 minutes was a conservative best guess. 5 minutes also might've worked. 2.5 minutes would've been pushing it, though with modern block propagation tech it might not be unreasonable for an altcoin to carefully try it.
Note that an altcoin with even a 10-second interval will function to start with, but it'll fall apart once it gets more miners and more weird situations. You can't point to an altcoin with bad parameters and say that it's safe just because it's working at the moment.
In the end it doesn't matter *all* that much, since even 1 minute blocks (unsafely low) will not-uncommonly result in transactions taking 10+ minutes to confirm due to variance; even 1 minute is too long for point-of-sale; and in other circumstances there isn't much difference between 1 minute and 10 minutes.

I think that this is how it works (but I'm not 100% sure): Every time Bitcoin Core hears about a newly-broadcast transaction, it records its fee and then later when the transaction gets confirmed it makes a note of how long it took. Then if you're willing to wait *x* blocks, it will give you an estimate by looking at all transactions that took *x* blocks to confirm and returning the median of their fees. So when you give Bitcoin Core the command `estimatefee 1` and it returns 0.00089285 (that's how I made my table), what this means is that among all transactions that got confirmed in the next block after being broadcast, the median fee was 0.00089285 BTC per KB.
As I mentioned, these estimates do sound somewhat high to me. Maybe the fee estimation feature isn't working perfectly for some reason.

How is that relevant to anything? This idea doesn't incorporate any voting or anything like that. The limits are enforced economically, so setting up a million nodes somewhere with specific limits would have no effect whatsoever (for high limits) or be no worse than creating many nodes that refuse to relay blocks on today's network (for low limits).
I guess people might try to manipulate the limits that businesses accept via the payment proposal polling that I mentioned, but you'd need to actually buy something from them for that.

Democracy is pretty ineffective at making good decisions in general, and Reddit's fake easy-to-manipulate democracy is even worse.
Preventing downvotes would probably be helpful. Downvotes are mainly used to hide unpopular opinions, which isn't good. I'd like it if posts were ranked according to how thoughtful they were, regardless of how many people agreed/disagreed with them. That's probably not really possible in a community of this size, but it'd be nice to move more in that direction where possible. Though I *can't* prevent downvotes, so debating it isn't very useful.

By downgrading ASAP, those pool operators caused the fork to end immediately; both 0.7 and 0.8 nodes were able to agree on the chain produced by the majority of mining power. Without this, *everyone* running 0.8 would have had to downgrade right away or risk accepting bad transactions.
Mining is nowadays somewhat more decentralized, though still not great.

Satoshi Nakamoto is an anagram of "I am NSA, took oaths". That should answer your question. ;)
It actually is pretty interesting/mysterious. NIST recommended a different curve, P-256, and that's what basically everyone used when Bitcoin was created. secp256k1 was used almost nowhere. There were even calls to change Bitcoin's curve since secp256k1 was so strange:  
  
  
But later on, years after Satoshi disappeared, it was discovered that all of the NIST-recommended curves were constructed in a very suspicious way and have an uncomfortably high likelihood of containing a backdoor. secp256k1 was probably one of the most secure standardized curves that Satoshi could have chosen in 2009, but this fact was not publicly known in 2009. Was he just lucky, or did he somehow have insider knowledge?

Miner agreement usually makes things significantly easier, but it's never required. Any softfork can be done as a hardfork. For example, if miners had refused to work with the developers on the 0.7-&gt;0.8 accidental hardfork issue, then everyone using 0.8 would have needed to manually downgrade or risk accepting invalid transactions, but the 0.8 chain still would have ended up being rejected by the vast majority of the economy in the end, and the 0.8 miners' mined bitcoins would have become worthless. I sometimes see people saying that the mining pools that abandoned their blocks in the 0.8 fork were behaving completely altruistically, but in fact their loss of those blocks was guaranteed; switching quickly just prevented them from losing even more money.
If the majority of miners don't like a change that is being pushed through via a hardfork, then they might try attacking the network by executing double-spending attacks or rejecting most transactions. But if this continues, Bitcoin will change its proof of work algorithm (a hardfork, but not a very controversial one if there are serious ongoing issues) and turn these miners' ASICs into paperweights. So miners have a *very* strong incentive to cooperate with the rest of the Bitcoin economy. Miners are employees of the network, not its governance.

Headers first does solve that issue. Bitcoin Core also skips signature verification on blocks before the latest checkpoint, which massively speeds up the initial sync time. I think the plan is to remove checkpoints and then fully verify only random transactions in very old blocks.

If you just have some proxy that sits between your company and the Internet and smashes transactions together, it'll be only a little more efficient. Transactions only contain 8 bytes of overhead outside of the inputs/outputs. (This sort of proxy isn't actually possible with SIGHASH_ALL -- not sure about other SIGHASH modes.) Though it is much more efficient in general to send multi-output transactions when you want to pay multiple people at around the same time, since it significantly reduces the total number of inputs/outputs related to change handling. It's very common (and has been for years) for companies that make many fairly small payments to collect up their pending payments and only actually send them every once in a while in a multi-output transaction.
If you're dealing with one company where everyone trusts each other or you have one trusted money-tracking server, you can just keep ledgers and settle-up for real at the end of the day. bitcoind even contains some support for this sort of thing with the `move` command. If you're dealing with untrusted people, you can use [payment channels]( Off-chain networks like Lightning are based on constructing a network of payment channels.

The slowness comes mostly from the verification of all blocks and the construction of the block index, not the download. By downloading the block database files, you're skipping verification, which can be dangerous.
You can improve your safety by doing this:
* Wait for all blocks to download, and make sure that at least one block was downloaded on top of those that came with the block database files.
* Check debug.log to get the hash for the latest block (SetBestChain: new best=**hash**)
* Compare this to the [latest block hash]( on Bitcoin Block Explorer
* Run Bitcoin once with the switch -checkblocks. Bitcoin will take a long time to start.
I don't think this protects against all attacks because I don't think checkblocks checks block hashes fully, and it doesn't do all of the AcceptBlock checks.
Future versions of Bitcoin will download just headers for all blocks on the first start, which will take only a few minutes.

It's arbitrary. Different colored coin systems do different things.
Some colored coin systems will attempt to track individual satoshi. So one satoshi would represent ownership in a share or whatever, and you can combine it with other such satoshi to bundle multiple shares. However, there is no objective way to track an individual satoshi. When you send a Bitcoin transaction, it's like taking a number of gold coins, melting them all together, and then producing one or more output coins -- you can't say objectively where any of the input coins are any more, though you could adopt a convention of (for example) saying that the first input coin transfers onto the first output coin, the second transfers onto the second, etc. Colored coin systems will, if they track individual satoshi, adopt some arbitrary convention such as this.
Some colored coin systems add extra data to transactions which act as additional info about the colored coins. Sometimes this extra data will contain separate transactions which add to or supersede the Bitcoin transactions. Sometimes colored coin systems won't even use the Bitcoin transaction system at all, but will just piggy-back their own separate transaction system onto the Bitcoin block chain.
In both cases, you generally need to have the entire Bitcoin block chain and then read through every transaction looking for colored coin metadata and following colored satoshi. Bitcoin doesn't support colored coins natively, so the standard scaling techniques such as pruning or SPV don't apply (at least not without modification).
However, I view colored coins as being useless in 90% of the cases that people tend to talk about. Bitcoin adds *decentralization* at the cost of *massive inefficiency*. So if you're trying to track something that is *already inherently centralized*, like shares in a centralized company (tracked by the company or by a stock exchange), movie seats (tracked by the theater), land (tracked by the government), votes (tracked by the government), ownership of smart property (tracked by the property itself), etc. then you're not actually gaining any benefit from Bitcoin's decentralization, but you are getting Bitcoin's massive inefficiency (high fees, slow confirmation times, etc.). In these cases, you should just use a traditional database managed by the centralized entity. There are various cryptographic techniques you can use to reliably detect tampering by the centralized entity without the need for a full-scale block chain.

Those are incentive issues, which are not bad. (Except that taxation is immoral.)
If 51% of the country moved away from Bitcoin, you'd still be free to use Bitcoin, and it'd still be somewhat useful to you. If 100% of the country moved away from Bitcoin, you'd still be free to use Bitcoin and attempt to convince people to move back to Bitcoin. This is freedom. If you're somehow *obligated* to follow a majority, then you lose this freedom.


I was talking there about "absolutely prohibited changes". Certain changes like increasing the inflation schedule break Bitcoin's promises and are therefore incompatible with the idea of Bitcoin. [See this article I created around that same time]( I still agree with what I said there: XT's change is not absolutely prohibited; if XT were to defeat Bitcoin on the market, it would be OK to call XT Bitcoin. That doesn't mean that it's not extremely dangerous/damaging to attempt a "hostile hardfork", nor does it mean that XT is *currently* equal to Bitcoin.
I also still think that assurance contracts are sufficient for incentivizing mining.

*We'll see*. Bitcoin is unprecedentedly deflationary, far moreso than even gold. Mainstream economists would call this a fatal flaw due to the "deflationary spiral" theory you described, but we've seen how well they've managed fiat economies... Other economists would say it's good because it ensures sound money and encourages delayed consumption. Maybe the mainstream economists are totally wrong and it'll actually be a good thing, or maybe it'll be a bit of a drag on BTC but not a huge deal, or maybe it'll eventually cause the Bitcoin economy to collapse somehow. In any case, this is how Bitcoin works, and it's not changing.
Note that while you could create a decentralized cryptocurrency with a permanent x% monetary inflation, it's impossible to create a *decentralized* cryptocurrency with monetary inflation that responds to wider economic conditions such as price inflation, which is what mainstream economists would want. A decentralized currency can never know its own price. For this sort of thing you'd need some human-run central bank, though you could design the system to give them strict limits on what they could do, so it could still be better than fiat currencies.

That would violate Bitcoin's coin distribution model. People invested in Bitcoin with the expectation that there would be gradual deflation due to coin loss. Redistributing lost coins would betray this belief. In fact, if Bitcoin's crypto ever becomes weak enough that lost bitcoins might thereby be stolen, Bitcoin will probably be changed to destroy those apparently-lost Bitcoins rather than allow them to be reintroduced.

The danger in running a non-Core full node is that it might not actually fully implement the consensus rules. If your software's behavior doesn't exactly match Core's behavior vis-à-vis the consensus rules, then your software is *wrong*, even if this behavior was previously unknown (like certain aspects of OP_CHECKSIG handling were unknown until an alt-full-node ran into them). Probably this isn't a big deal for most people, but it means that you weren't actually contributing to the network's economic strength while you were running the non-Core "full node" (or not contributing as much, at least), and it might also mean that you'd accept a transaction/block as confirmed when it should be rejected, possibly allowing you to be defrauded (a very major risk for businesses). And in fact most attempts to create non-Core full nodes are known to have had at least a few flaws in their consensus code when they were released.
The Core devs are working on creating libconsensus, which will eventually allow people to create non-Core full node software without this risk.

That's still enforced. Bitcoin Core won't relay or mine transactions that contain any outputs with less value. And if Bitcoin Core happens to select coins when sending a transaction such that you would have less than 5430 satoshi in change, it'll just throw that change away by adding it to the transaction fee.

It's important for SPV security that miners enforce validity like that. That's not the way to make decisions. If Satoshi meant for miners to make decisions, then he would have had full nodes just follow miners blindly and not have any sort of core, hardfork-requiring rules.

That wouldn't be effective AFAICT. Miners don't need to rely on the Bitcoin network for speedy relaying of blocks/transactions amongst each other. Miners can connect directly to each other and just keep working on a large chain that they know the real network will eventually end up accepting. In fact, most miners *already* [use an out-of-band block relay network]( which reduces orphan risk. As long as the Bitcoin network will *eventually* accept miners' blocks, and 51%+ of miners will accept their blocks, they have no real problem. But too-large blocks are a major problem for full nodes because they will get "picked off one-by-one" as resource usage gradually becomes too large. The only way to prevent this is to *completely* reject too-large blocks.

What you're attempting to do violates many Bitcoin best-practices:
1. Don't try to use a brain wallet. There are some *extraordinarily rare* circumstances where a brain wallet might make some sense, but it is inherently risky and should be a last resort of highly experienced Bitcoin users, not something that any ordinary Bitcoin user should attempt.
2. Don't use a website to generate any security-sensitive stuff, even if the website claims that it's using only client-side JavaScript.
3. Don't deal directly with Bitcoin keypairs. Only deal with entire wallets (usually HD wallets).
The brainwallet generation algorithm is theoretically also a concern, I suppose, but if you carry on like this then you're probably going to lose your BTC anyway, so you won't have time to worry about it.
Use a proper software or hardware wallet like Electrum. Use a strong passphrase, write down the seed mnemonic that it gives you, and put the mnemonic in a safe place. Most wallets nowadays are HD wallets, so if the wallet file is lost, you can recover all BTC in the wallet with just the mnemonic that you wrote down at the start. Backups are not *critical*, though they are useful for preserving address labels and such. If a super-experienced Bitcoin user ended up in the extraordinarily rare last-resort situation of needing to use a brain wallet, probably the best way to do it would be to memorize the several-word mnemonic output by an HD wallet, and then shred the wallet file every time it is finished being used. Again, ordinary Bitcoiners should not seek to do this.

I said it's impossible for the *source* release to be compromised without being noticed. It would be incredibly obvious that someone is locking a block that doesn't exist in the main chain. The *binary* release might be compromised stealthily for a while.
The paper is talking about a main network that is always running. If the main network stops growing, then someone can eventually catch up. An attacker can stay in control as long as he's running with more than 50% of the network's computational power. Once he stops, the main network will eventually catch up.
To catch up, you have to re-do all the hashes the other chain has done (give or take some based on luck). The network is currently doing 500 ghash/s, so if an attacker takes down the network for an hour, does the same 500 ghash/s for an hour, and then stops, the network will take about an hour to undo the attacker's changes. This assumes the attacker isn't modifying past blocks, which would make his attack more difficult.
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:10:50


It's part of the transaction, and usually the entire transaction (minus the signature) is signed.


It used to be the case that you could send a time-locked transaction and the network would remember it for a while and automatically "broadcast" it when it became valid. You could also replace the version stored by the network by changing the sequence numbers of a transaction's inputs. This was removed long ago. The network will reject non-final transactions unless they will become final in the next block. You need to handle broadcasting time-locked transactions out-of-band.
LockTime is itself fully supported, and always has been.

It's the "need" word that's troublesome. It's a technical fact that full-node-users *don't* need to do anything to continue using the currency that they signed up for. Maybe a lot of other people will consider the original currency not-Bitcoin anymore (maybe even and bitcointalk.org in some cases), but they'll be free to choose.
There are large incentives, especially if the hardfork changes are actually good. But at the end of the day each person gets to choose without any "hard" coersion from anyone. That's true freedom.
To some degree this particular argument is semantics, but I think the idea is important.


In Bitcoin's case, I think that it's reasonable to expect technically sound changes to have no significant opposition. This has been done many times in the past with the various softfork changes and BIP 50. If there's uncertainty, then it is appropriate to stick with the status quo. That's what everyone signed up for, and what's known to work at least OK. (Maybe if it's *extremely* clear that a few centralized entities who would normally be able to block consensus are opposing something for no good reason, the community can *eventually* move toward ignoring them. The definition of consensus is subjective, after all -- each person is responsible for determining whether consensus exists.)
If you truly think that Bitcoin cannot *survive* without a max block size increase, and no compromise is possible, then it's not somehow *morally wrong* to try a hostile hardfork. But you can't expect the existing Bitcoin economy to treat your software as if it's the same as Bitcoin and put up no resistance to your attempt. I see a hostile hardfork as being very similar to real-world war. Sometimes (very rarely) war is necessary, but it causes a lot of evil and usually ends up hurting both sides severely in the end.

Bitcoin is not some sort of "economic democracy". In a democracy, the minority is forced to accept things by the majority. In Bitcoin, an economic majority can't force you into doing anything. A full node will enforce its rules forever, no matter what miners or anyone else does. If a majority of "the economy" (difficult to set the boundaries of this) are using a currency that you are not, then this creates strong incentives for you to buy that currency. Though obviously this incentive is not irresistible/overwhelming or we'd all be using dollars. This creation of incentives isn't a form of majoritarianism.

That's certainly occurring as well, but I consider it pretty likely that there's some vote manipulation. This seems especially clear when a comment is slowly gaining upvotes to +10 or more, and then all of a sudden it drops down to -20 or something in a couple hours. I've seen this happen first-hand on a few occasions, and people have also told me about it happening to them (in relevant threads). Certain Bitcoin experts also seem to be targeted by constant, lower-grade manipulation: no matter what they post, even if it's amazingly good, they'll get 5-10 downvotes shortly after they post. And I don't see much reason to be overly skeptical about someone performing these attacks, since AFAIK they're pretty easy: you just need a handful of established Reddit accounts and some care in how you use them to avoid alerting Reddit admins.

The fee market doesn't work for incentivizing mining in general. Firstly, the fees that people pay are totally unrelated to the security that they receive, so people have no incentive to pay more than is necessary for their desired confirmation time. Secondly, if there are even just a few stupid or generous miners who accept transactions at a loss, then miners as a group lose their ability to enforce reasonable pricing. If 1% of miners accept transactions with essentially no fee and 99% of miners only accept transactions that are high enough to pay for their current costs plus a little profit, then at least some users will send transactions at the lower fee level to save money. But since adding just one more transaction is nearly free, the latter group of miners will constantly want to accept these cheaper transactions as well to make a little more money, and I'd expect the percentage of low-fee miners to gradually increase. So I'd expect the actual transaction fee to move toward the cost of adding a transaction to a block, which is almost nothing, and certainly not enough to support sufficient network security.
One way of solving this is by artificially restricting the size of blocks. With very large blocks, miners need to think about rejecting transactions purely to convince people to pay more, and this probably won't end up creating profitable prices. If miners can only include so many transactions, then this creates actual competitive demand for block space. With small blocks, miners just include the highest-fee transactions, and the fee varies only according to the demand at the time. There's no guarantee that the price arrived at through competition for block space will be in any way *correct*, as it is entirely unrelated to the amount of network security that Bitcoin users need or desire. But it makes it likely that at least some miners (the most efficient ones) will make a profit, which is probably not the case with large blocks. Therefore, a really conservative strategy for managing the max block size would be to keep the max block size small until we're sure that fees are high enough to support sufficient network security, and only then carefully increase the max block size. There are other proposals like flex cap idea which try to maintain the artificial scarcity in a more free-market way, though there are AFAICT always constants which somehow influence various costs -- a form of unfortunate (though in the end perhaps necessary and survivable) central economic planning.
Rather than artificially introducing scarcity in block space, I think that it would probably be sufficient to forego transaction fees except as an anti-spam measure and just rely on assurance contracts. Once a company feels that the network's mining power is too low for comfort, it'd start an assurance contract to collect some money to incentivize mining over a time period. The first company might start out the fund with 10 BTC, and set up the assurance contract such that 500 BTC must be collected for all of the payments to unlock and miners to be paid. (Some protocol extensions or something might be necessary for the payment to get spread out over a time period.) It is a common goods problem, but I don't think that Bitcoin users (especially businesses) will allow things to degrade to insecure levels when they can improve the situation by donating a very small amount in an assurance contract every now and then. Wallet software might even suggest donation amounts periodically, perhaps calculated according to the wallet's recent transaction volume and the network's current difficulty. People are mostly not rational+selfish economic actors (look at kickstarter and patreon), and I think that just *asking* for donations from a ton of people may well be sufficient.
Modern-day network difficulty is way higher than it needs to be. Certainly the network doesn't require 25 BTC every block for security, and fees+donations don't need to gather that much.
I'm not sure that assurance contracts will work. Despite being an anarcho-capitalist and free-marketeer, I am not *utterly opposed* to artificially restricting block space *if necessary*. But I'd like to try all other possible options (including new research) before resorting to the not-free-market artificial scarcity method.
Decentralization is another matter. Some sort of max block size (maybe not necessarily a *global* max block size) is necessary to prevent miners from preventing people from running full nodes by creating too-large blocks. (If the economy is not mostly backed by full nodes, Bitcoin is terribly insecure.) Maybe the required max block size for decentralization will be lower than the max block size required for sufficient fees (in which case there is no problem with fees), or maybe it'll be much higher -- I don't know.

Bitcoin transactions contain little scripts written in a custom scripting language. To send bitcoins, you give appropriate parameters to the script of the transaction you're spending so that the script returns true. See 
The scripts in these transactions were mistakenly written so that they *never* return true. There's no chance that anyone will ever get the BTC, since there is no possible input that will cause the scripts to return true.
The stock Bitcoin client will never produce transactions like these. Someone modified his client to do this.
Transactions like these are not considered *illegal* because it is impossible to accurately detect all cases like this. Miners using the stock client will refuse to include these transactions in their blocks, though, since they are non-standard. These transactions were picked up by miners using non-default code.

Bitcoin was nothing. There were only maybe 100 or so really-active Bitcoin users before the Slashdot coverage in mid-2010 or whenever. I used to read *every single post* made to the forum, and pre-Slashdot this was very easy.
Almost all of the very early Bitcoiners were libertarians of some sort and mostly interested in the political and economic aspects of Bitcoin. I actually can't think of anyone besides myself, Sirius, and Satoshi who put all that much thought into the technology before mid-2010 when people like ArtForz, Jeff Garzik, and Gavin came around.
ArtForz is an interesting person who is now mostly forgotten. He was the top Bitcoin expert besides Satoshi for quite some time. AFAIK he's the one who found (and privately reported to Satoshi) the bugs in Bitcoin that would have allowed anyone to steal anyone's bitcoins. I (and probably many modern experts and core devs) received a lot of my early Bitcoin knowledge from ArtForz. He was also personally &gt;50% of the mining power for a while, since he created the first ASICs.
Dragon's Tale still exists, I think. I beta-tested it a bit before the official release. It's cool.
The first automated exchange was called Bitcoin Market (BCM), which I rather liked. It worked like a modern exchange in that trades would be executed when they met on the order book, but then each person was responsible for actually filling the orders using a system a bit like LocalBitcoins where the site would escrow the BTC side and then the buyer would pay via Liberty Reserve or PayPal or whatever. There were a few attempts to do automated PayPal exchanges, but these tended to fail pretty quickly due to chargeback scamming. When MtGox came around I thought that it would probably fail again, so I didn't register there for several days after the announcement. But even so, I was MtGox user  -- that gives you some sense of how small the community was at this time.

Defining the protocol with some separate English specification would be useless. Firstly, English is too inexact. Secondly, no matter what the specification said, if 99% of people are using software which has rules that are different than the specification, then the specification and anyone using its rules are simply wrong. No one would do a hardfork because Core doesn't match the specification: the specification would have to be changed. So the only specification is Core right now.
It is possible to create a specification in a programming language. That's currently Bitcoin Core. But Bitcoin Core is also a wallet and a network node, which makes it difficult to isolate/understand the consensus rules, so there's an effort to separate the consensus specification into a self-contained library called libconsensus. Maybe later the specification could be further separated into a form that each full node could load into special virtual machines.


I don't see how that's relevant. That sort of thing could happen no matter what. libconsensus will probably make it less likely, in fact.

When done properly, CoinJoin completely breaks the transaction graph. Even if you know that someone contributed to a CoinJoin transaction, there's no way for you to figure out which non-change output is theirs unless you can somehow differentiate the CoinJoin participants using transaction info after the CoinJoin. If you do many CoinJoin transactions in a row (or use CoinJoin/CoinSwap for all transactions), this should provide pretty strong, long-term anonymity. (This is planned for Bitcoin Core eventually.)

Malware and data loss are the two big issues with that, but IMO it's generally better than trusting an exchange. If you have an unused computer lying around, you could dedicate it to being your Bitcoin wallet; this substantially reduces the malware risk, though not as much as a hardware wallet.


Ideally, you want to keep as little money on an exchange as you can without generating tons of Bitcoin transaction fees. So if you're dollar-cost-averaging, maybe you'd withdraw to your personal wallet every few hundred dollars. Active traders who constantly buy and sell need to keep more money on the exchange. Though I'd zero out my BTC balance before any split, no matter what the exchange says about it.

The code that contains a hard MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant instead of just having miners vote? If all Satoshi cared about was the majority of miners, then the max block size would have been pointless.

1. If many nodes are taken offline for a short period, the generation difficulty remains the same, and the attacker doesn't get anything.

Bitcoin would not die if SHA-256 was completely broken. If that happens, past transaction/block hashes can be hardcoded for verification. Future transactions will require a different hash algorithm for signing. Unspent address transactions can use hardcoded public keys where they are known. Only transactions to addresses that have never been used and therefore have no known public key would be lost.
It might even be possible to recover from a complete ECDSA breakage, depending on the nature of the attack. Maybe the ECDSA keys could be reused in a modified elliptic curve signing algorithm that isn't totally broken.

Pruning takes place as you're downloading blocks, so the total database size will never go far above the current UTXO size (currently ~1.3 GB) when pruning is enabled.
You can just copy over the database files and it should work, but then you're trusting that whoever provided you with the pruned database is honest. Tampering with the database can allow the attacker to break your node at any future time of their choosing or (with some mining power) convince you to accept invalid transactions as confirmed.
Someday, Bitcoin Core will probably start out in SPV mode so that it is immediately functional as a wallet, but then very slowly download historical blocks in the background until it has downloaded and verified them all.

The anonymity of Bitcoin would not be hurt even if only one miner existed. Only stability is affected.
An attacker with control of &gt;50% of the network can't "print money" faster than anyone else. The difficulty will adjust. They can only reverse their transactions, prevent other generators from generating, and prevent transactions from being confirmed.
All attacks that require &gt;50% of the network are easily detectable. You'll hear about it if it happens. Later versions of Bitcoin will automatically react to some of these attacks. Bitcoin Block Explorer is already programmed to react to any attack that would reverse a transaction with 6 confirmations.
If the attacker succeeds in reversing a transaction (on a block chain basis, not through the TCP network), the old version will not be put back when the honest nodes regain control.

In general, you want to replace democracy with some sort of free market. This often requires major system changes, though. You can't just do a "search-and-replace".
In this case, just removing votes and sorting things chronologically would be an improvement. This does make it more difficult to locate good comments, though many extremely successful forums have managed to survive even despite that.
One possible way of improving organization without introducing the problems of Reddit would be to have voting, but replace the global scoring system with a per-user web of trust system. So you'd either explicitly write a list of good posters or this'd be automatically calculated from your upvote stats, and then you'd recursively add their list of good posters, etc., down several levels. Then you'd only take into account the votes of people in your extended "good poster" network. This is somewhat like bitcointalk.org's trust system, which was in turn inspired by the WoT-based anti-spam system of Freenet's FMS (decentralized forum software).
Another decent way of doing things would be to have moderators just rank everything manually, or have the ability to override user votes. But that's a lot of work, and there wouldn't be much granularity in the free market: you'd either have to accept ranking (which *no one* would consider perfect) or move to a different subreddit which is also imperfect (and also smaller).
There are probably other possible good solutions. The key is to eliminate any *global* vote-based score. Discussing this here is a bit pointless, though, since there's very little chance that Reddit is going to change its core structure.

The most important ideas behind Bitcoin are IMO the ones expressed by Satoshi [here]( (my emphasis):




The "no matter what" part is what I'm talking about here. It doesn't matter what the economy or miners do: your full node will follow the rules, always and forever, unless you personally accept new rules.
BIP 50 is an example of a successful hardfork (or, some would say, something only very similar to a hardfork). Everyone agreed to the change, so it happened in a few months without much problem. The old network/currency was abandoned at a specific "flag day", at which time everyone moved to the new network/currency that we're still using today. People still had the option to continue using the old currency with its non-deterministic max block size rules, and you could load up Bitcoin 0.1 right now and start mining on that old currency if you wanted, but no one of any economic significance really saw any reason for doing this at the time. When there's widespread consensus on a max block size proposal (or other hardfork proposal), the same thing will happen. If a hardfork proposal can't proceed in the same sort of smooth way as BIP 50, then it's too controversial to happen. Everyone using Bitcoin today has already unanimously agreed on the current rules. Trying to split the economy/currency/network 51-49 (or even 95-5) is incredibly harmful to the economy, and unfair to the people whose ideas of Bitcoin you're disregarding. There's no real reason why some majority's idea of what "Bitcoin" is should supersede the previous status quo which everyone accepted. (A lot of people for some reason think majority vote -&gt; truth/good/acceptable, but there's no logical reason for this.) Ideally, we'd require 100% unanimous agreement from all Bitcoin stakeholders before changing the rules. But Bitcoin is doomed in that case, so we have to relax the requirements a bit and say that consensus exists and a hardfork can proceed when there's "no economically-significant disagreement". The reason for this particular limit is that it guarantees that there will be no split in the economy, and it keeps the number of "disenfranchised" Bitcoin users very small. It should also be attainable for technically sound proposals. Hardfork changes can also be done without consensus, but in this case the change is called a "hostile hardfork" or "economic redefinition" (= an altcoin, at least to start with). Probably in practice a 95-5 *economic split* would cause almost all of the remaining 5% to move to the new currency due to economic incentives, and this is also somewhat likely to eventually occur in a 51-49 split (though not guaranteed), but this should be regarded as more-or-less an unfortunate flaw of the Universe, not something good, and certainly not a legitimate path forward except *maybe* in the most desperate of circumstances. The goal of Bitcoin is individual sovereignty, not any sort of majoritarianism. Trying to change Bitcoin while even *one* person strongly disagrees with the change compromises Bitcoin's principles; while the nature of reality makes this necessary (in small amounts) if Bitcoin is to survive long-term, it should be minimized and lamented, not in any way endorsed or celebrated.
Miners are almost totally irrelevant. They are employees of the network, nothing more. In making decisions, there should be no difference between 100% miner support and 0% miners support. (The latter would necessitate a little uncontroversial hardfork to unjam the network, and if unexpected it could cause some network downtime, but we should focus almost entirely on long-term issues, not stuff like this.)
Nodes themselves are also irrelevant. If you have 100,000 nodes sitting on severs out there, you're just wasting money. There is no voting among nodes.
The main factor is the adoption of the full-node-backed economy. Though as I explain above, it shouldn't be a majority vote.

Haha, I just yesterday wrote this article:  . Don't worry, you can keep your BTC safe even if the world is reduced to a smoking ruin!
I didn't include price speculation in that article, but I think that the BTC/USD price would continually go up as war approaches, since BTC would probably be perceived as more resilient if the US government is in danger of being damaged/destroyed/destabilized by war. However, once nuclear war seems downright *likely*, I'd expect the value of both BTC and USD to collapse in real terms. You don't really want imaginary numbers in a ledger/account in the aftermath of a nuclear war; you want water, food, ammunition, and *maybe* precious metals.
Also, I always like to remind people when talking about nuclear war that unless you live in a large city, you very much *can* survive a nuclear war. Don't expect to just immediately be vaporized; more people will probably die from preventable fallout radiation or starvation rather than from the blasts themselves. (Amusingly, FEMA just 2 months ago put out [this video]( on how to protect yourself from nuclear fallout.)

I said that *if* 90% of people find policies intolerable, then they should leave. I don't actually think that 90% of users should leave. The point of that hypothetical example was to emphasize my total rejection of majoritarianism.


That may be partly to blame, though I strongly suspect that there's at least some degree of manipulation (ie. organized groups of people, maybe with the help of alts, trying specifically to downvote certain people/ideas into obscurity). Certain comments get downvoted too quickly (sometimes after having had a +5 or even +10 score previously), while other comments elsewhere expressing the exact same ideas end up being left alone, presumably because they pass under the manipulators' radar.


That isn't actually possible, unfortunately. It can be done visually via CSS, but that just gives trolls the advantage because they'll be the only ones who care enough to disable subreddit CSS and downvote people.

Madoff's scheme paid about 10% yearly for 20 years.


No, how these work is that no real money is actually made. Rather, everyone is paid with future deposits. So if 4 people each invest 1 BTC, the fund will have 4 BTC. Then a month later the fund will *tell* these people that they each have 1.5 BTC, while the fund actually only has 4 BTC still. If one or two people try to withdraw, then the fund will survive, and some people will still think that they have 1.5 BTC. But unless nobody ever tries to withdraw, the fund will eventually collapse when people try to withdraw more than the fund has.
When the fund actually makes money, it's called a bank account or mutual fund. There are plenty of those in fiat currencies. However, because the BTC price is volatile and there's not really any way to invest *directly* in BTC (AFAIK there are no legitimate BTC-denominated bonds, for example), a BTC-denominated mutual fund or interest-paying bank account would probably be very difficult to do. If there was a mature BTC derivatives market, maybe you could do it by hedging against changes in the BTC/USD price, but in that case the fund's yield would take a big hit and maybe not end up positive.

Although the image is *technically* correct (the best kind of correct!), it's misleading in a number of ways:
* The image says (my emphasis), "they strongly imply that **brute-force attacks** against 256-bit keys will be infeasible". A brute-force attack means that you go through every possible private key until you find one matching the public key you're trying to attack. In reality, brute-force attacks against cryptographic *keys* are very rare because it is always the slowest possible attack. Typically, short-cuts are found which allow for breaking keys with much less effort than a brute-force search. QC is one such shortcut which works on certain kinds of crypto.
* Although Bitcoin private keys are 256 bits long, Bitcoin's ECDSA/secp256k1 public-key crypto is known to have no more than 128 bits of security. This means that shortcuts are known which would allow for finding the private key associated with any known public key in about 2^128 operations on a classical computer (~0 on QC), not 2^256 as implied by the image.
* Version 0 addresses (ones starting with 1) with unknown ECDSA public keys have no more than 160 bits of security on a classical computer (80 on QC).
* If you want to randomly generate addresses until you generate the same one twice, then this is a birthday problem, which makes it far easier. If Bitcoin totally takes over and is used for hundreds of years with the same version-0 addresses, it is actually within the realm of possibility that two people could generate the same address (probably separated by many years and resulting in no opportunity for theft).
For quantum computing, see:

*If* every single person was using a full node, then any attack like that would be a lot more difficult. Miners+exchanges trying to force a hardfork would be immediately rejected by basically all of the economy. If miners+exchanges tried to force an evil softfork, the vast majority of the economy could split from these miners+exchanges with a hardfork.
However, it is currently a major problem how both mining *and* verification is often substantially centralized. One or the other needs to be decentralized for Bitcoin to be secure. There are too many big central services, and too often people/businesses use centralized verification methods like BitGo or lightweight nodes (which trust miners blindly). This section of the economy would blindly go along with whoever they're trusting in case of an evil hardfork or softfork. I suspect that the mining centralization problem won't be fixed anytime soon, so it's important to make it easier to properly verify. One thing I'm hopeful about is fraud proofs (mentioned by Satoshi in the original paper), which would allow even lightweight nodes to *most of the time* enforce the consensus rules in the same way as full nodes.

There are always tens of thousands of unconfirmed transactions floating around. Anyone can generate a near-infinite amount of them with a simple `while true; do bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress ...`, using a very low fee. All of these mempool-counting sites use some undefined methodology for which transactions they'll actually count, but if you run Bitcoin Core for a while and check its `getmempoolinfo`, you'll see that it's basically always full of 150+ MB of very-low-fee transactions. So it's meaningless to quote mempool tx counts or data sizes.
What causes wait times like those that were seen today are a backlog of higher-fee transactions, usually combined with poor fee estimation by wallets. A more useful metric for measuring the overall delay/backlog would be the total fees sitting in your mempool, or the highest-fee transaction that was not included in the last couple of blocks. But then you also have to be careful to exclude transactions that are invalid, non-standard, or otherwise disliked by miners; for example, bc.i for a very long time counted completely invalid transactions in many of its stats, and may still do so.

This is a pretty rough idea. It's not intended to be even on the path toward a draft BIP.
I first came up with this idea [years ago]( but mostly I dropped it. I was reminded of it again by [this post]( which proposes something a bit similar.
This is probably not the objective-best way of doing things, but I think that it might work as a compromise because:
* Big-block people will at least get the *possibility* of blocks large enough to satisfy them, and this also reduces the amount of "central economic planning" -- a common concern of big-blocks people.
* Conservative people will get two safeguards against decentralization loss: the basic schedule itself (which should be chosen to be at least not *insane* from a conservative standpoint) and the economically-enforced individual limits.
* The individual limits alone do not impose artificial block-space scarcity (which some believe is necessary for mining incentives long-term), though using flex cap as the primary max block size schedule could fix this.
* It still might give miners and businesses more influence than is ideal. Maybe some tweaking could improve this.

There would probably be someone with a satellite link or something. We only need one connection.

UTXOs are not stored entirely in memory. They amount to several GB, so requiring this would be unreasonable; Bitcoin Core can be made to run on systems with less than 1 GB of memory.


I think that it'd be *possible* to survive with a 1 MB max block size forever, but in some cases an increase would be better. For example, it's generally agreed that SegWit's impending increase of the max block size to 4 MB (but with additional weight restrictions) is good and reasonably safe.

You can run a full node without forwarding any ports, though networking-wise you may be a slight leech on the network. However, you'll still contribute to Bitcoin's [economic strength]( if you use the full node for your own transactions.

The market will benefit, no matter what happens. Either bad traders/exchanges will be eliminated, or trade will happen more smoothly.
I think that the market is too volatile for forex-style margin trading (with automatic margin calls) to be useful. It would be too easy for traders to lose everything after an unexpected price drop. So I don't think MtGox will implement it (except maybe for very trusted traders), and I don't think it will be very popular if it is implemented (except for gamblers).

(E-1) nodes certainly couldn't do it. You'd need to maintain a massive advantage over all running miners for a long time. Even then, the real network would eventually gain control after the attacker stopped.
If an attacker manages to defeat the entire network in some way that is insurmountable normally, a new version of Bitcoin will be released which fixes it. The correct block hashes will be hard-coded if necessary.
It's impossible for someone to add a fake checkpoint to the source releases without being noticed and stopped. A compromised binary release might last for a while, but Bitcoin has an independently-verifiable official build process, so someone would notice this eventually.

The miner can optionally add transactions to the block. The miner then gets the fees for those transactions if they end up solving the block first. The transactions are received from the TCP relay network.

Edit: Though after actually looking at the cloud mining prices, it seems far too expensive/risky/slow -- you'd almost certainly lose a lot of money on the deal. I suppose what you'd really want for cloud mining is to buy a few months of very-high-hashrate mining, but nobody seems to offer that.

No, the average time until the next block is always 10 minutes (assuming perfect difficulty). It doesn't matter when the last block was mined. Mining is a Poisson process, so the time until the next block follows an exponential distribution.
It's not clear to me why the bc.i median wait time sticks around 10 minutes. I don't think that there's a mathematical reason for it, and it seems highly dependent on exactly which transactions they track. The *average* wait time can't be less than 10 minutes assuming perfect difficulty.

Both of the likely-to-win presidential candidates are very bad. I believe that Clinton is pure evil at heart, unlike some other politicians such as Obama who are IMO motivated at least to some extent by good intentions, and are merely misguided. Trump has no ideology, very little knowledge about any of the important issues, and perhaps an unprecedentedly high level of *open* authoritarianism.
I don't really believe in voting in general (probably you'd do more to help your ideals by spending the time you'd spend voting on making a few dollars and donating them to some political non-profit such as the EFF), and I especially don't believe in voting for the lesser of two evils, so I'm probably not going to vote this year.
I've gone back and forth on which likely-to-win candidate would be better from the libertarian perspective. Some thoughts:
* For the most part, you can't trust what either of them says they're going to do. Trump doesn't know what his own positions are, and Clinton treats lying like breathing.
* Clinton loves war, and hates Russia, especially now that she thinks that Russia is trying to help Trump defeat her. The chances of her starting nuclear war with Russia are higher than normal, and almost certainly she will start various additional small wars in third-word countries.
* Trump has been verbally less interventionist than normal, which is good, but he has also said extremely aggressive things about ISIS which would seem to suggest at least some military involvement in the middle-east. He probably doesn't even know what he wants.
* Trump supports tariffs, which are very bad.
* Trump is openly authoritarian. He has called for placing restrictions on the Internet, "opening up" libel laws, executing Snowden, etc. However, it is not clear to me that Hillary is any better on these issues.
* Trump has very little experience in politics, so he *might* be so ineffective that he manages to do very little of his agenda. This would be good.
* Clinton has a lot of experience, so would normally be extremely good at getting her agenda done. However, she may be slightly impeded by Republican control of the House and possibly the Senate, whereas if Trump wins he will probably have both the House and Senate backing him.
* Clinton has a huge pot full of scandals that are already starting to boil over. If she is elected, this may give Republicans significant leverage over her. This could be good or bad.
* Republicans are incorrectly viewed as being strong  supporters of some libertarian positions such as free markets. When Republicans screw things up, it reflects poorly on libertarianism (unfairly). It may be better for the purposes of spreading libertarianism to allow a Democrat (viewed as anti-free-market) to fail rather than a Republican.
* It seems to me possible that Trump would have such little respect for the rule of law that he would openly defy the boundaries of the executive branch in ways that are far worse than has ever been done before, and with a Republican-controlled congress, he may not be adequately challeneged. Whereas Clinton will want to more-or-less maintain the status quo, and will probably only continue the steady expansion of the executive's power.
* The plan put forward on  is far from a libertarian plan, but would be a good step in the right direction. If Trump was elected, it would probably be easier for Republicans to enact this plan.
* Although I agree with liberal judges on some things, probably it is better to enforce the original-intent interpretation of the constitution as much as possible. Therefore, conservative judges are probably better.
Overall, based on the fairly limited data that I have available to me, I guess that they're more-or-less equal from the perspective of "who would be best for libertarianism." However, I very much dislike Clinton due to her being 100% rotten-to-the-core evil, so I think that I would be a bit happier if Trump won.
I like Peter Thiel. I'm sure he's aware that Trump is no libertarian, but he probably feels that Clinton is much worse. I'm not inclined to strongly disagree.

It scales very well, and it's basically how many lightweight wallets work today, but it assumes that miners are honest, which has increasingly become an unreliable assumption. Remember that when the paper was written, Satoshi was assuming that mining would be *extremely* decentralized, roughly approximating one-person-one-vote via one-cpu-one-vote. This is far from true today. Additionally, in the paper Satoshi mentions that for a reasonable level of security SPV clients should receive "alerts" (now known as fraud proofs), in which full nodes would broadcast proofs that the longest chain is invalid when this occurs and lightweight nodes would then reject this invalid chain. However, it's turned out to have been much more difficult to implement this than Satoshi expected: it's known to be impossible as Bitcoin is now, and even the best known softfork-enabled designs would not be able to detect attacks 100% of the time.


IIRC there was talk of removing it in 0.13 or 0.14 because it takes up a lot of space, it's never been used, and it's likely that when/if this sort of thing is ever needed, it'll be desirable to store something other than what's stored now. But I don't know whether this was actually done or not.

Not all at once, of course. If the money was just sitting around then it couldn't be invested. There's nothing wrong with fractional reserve if depositors know that it's happening.
How to run a bank in 4 easy steps:
1. Deal with the regulatory issues. (This is 99% of the work.)
2. Take deposits.
3. Use 90% of the deposits to buy short-term treasury bonds, passing most of the interest from these bonds onto depositors. Currently this is an interest rate of around 0.3%.
4. When people want to withdraw, usually you'll have enough cash to do it because you keep a 10% reserve. In the rare case of a bank run, you need to do one of these: refuse the withdrawal until some bonds mature, sell some bonds (possibly at a loss), or take out a short-term loan (this is what US banks usually do).

BTC is destroyed all the time whenever people lose their wallets. Sometimes it is also lost when people do unusual protocol things like this. Either way, the network is not really hurt because BTC can be divided into very small amounts. If anything, a reduced supply increases the BTC price.

With the two normal address types (P2PKH, starting with 1, and P2SH, starting with 3), that's not possible.
Consider for example [this address]( which I picked at random. It received two transactions: [[1]]( [[2]]( If you click the "expand details" icon in the upper right, you'll see that both transactions have the same scriptPubKey: `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 836dceed7ca22a959fbbdd1f2b3156b38dfeee3f OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`. The address 1Cyw4kDCvGun9CNZzRVvzojtsik4qKeX8n requires that exact scriptPubKey, and vice-versa. The Bitcoin protocol never writes actual addresses to the wire, so the way that wallets and block explorers figure out the destination address of a transaction is by looking at the scriptPubKey pattern, which usually has exactly one possible address. If a transaction is sent to two different addresses, and those addresses are the normal P2PKH or P2SH types, then they *must* have different scriptPubKeys.
Other rare or not-yet-invented address types can behave differently. For example, a single stealth address will result in many different scriptPubKey outputs, and you can't go from scriptPubKey to stealth address.

For all this time and for at least the next few years, miners are supported 99% by the subsidy. Fees are insignificant. Most miners use fees almost entirely for identifying spam and prioritizing transactions, often using the default economically-irrational Bitcoin Core policies. You can't say anything about the very-low-subsidy future from the high-subsidy past and present.


Your paper is not at all accepted by experts. You make many huge assumptions that are not likely to be true. For example, while I agree that miners would not create blocks with sizes tending toward infinity *forever*, there's no reason to think that the value that miners end up reaching will be compatible with decentralization/security.


Miners don't have the right incentives to police themselves here.
I acknowledged in my first linked comment that it may be possible to remove the global max block size if more free-market equivalents to the max block size are created. I even proposed one such alternative myself. But your idea is a vast overhaul of how the system currently works, requiring tons of software and protocol changes to prevent the system from collapsing right away. It's not going to happen anytime soon, and it's not going to happen at all if the evidence for its long-term safety doesn't become more than vague guesses. I am *very* confident that Bitcoin can continue to function with its current security/decentralization properties with some sort of reasonable global max block size. Maybe there are better ways of doing things, but totally changing how the max block size works without some deep thought/research/experimentation is unbelievably reckless.


I don't know. If it can, that'd be good. Free-market solutions are far better where possible. But you can't *assume* that throwing the undirected market at *any* problem will always work. For example, we can't just have unlimited currency supply and let the market decide. If Bitcoin cannot function without a not-very-free-market solution, then that's fine -- we'll just have to live with it.
Even David Friedman, one of the fathers of anarcho-capitalism, says that an anarcho-capitalist society would not be very effective against huge external threats. The free market works in *almost* all cases, but not 100%.
In any case, having network operators independently decide which rules to enforce is not in any way "top-down". Rule by miners is what would be top-down.


How do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you say nonsense like that?
* This is not how Bitcoin works on a technical level, now or ever. There are a wide variety of scenarios in which a full node will reject the longest chain. It is also obviously not how Satoshi intended Bitcoin to work, or he would have programmed Bitcoin to actually work in that way.
* If you want to change Bitcoin so that it works in this way, then you're arguing that a handful of mostly-anonymous pool operators on the other side of the world with no long-term economic interest in you or Bitcoin should be in charge of the Bitcoin currency. This is ridiculous. Miners are given power over *only* transaction ordering, and only because there is no technical alternative to this.


That's not what Bitcoin is about. The currency schedule is immutable. Anything that changes this or allows it to be changed is non-Bitcoin, absolutely.

His comments seem to apply more-or-less equally well to softforks.
In a softfork, the consensus rules are changed in three steps:
1. First, the majority of miners enforce the additional restrictions on transactions and blocks. At this point any features enabled by the softfork become *usable*, but are not really secure.
2. Second, the full-node economy *tolerates* these restrictions. If the full-node economy does not approve of the new restrictions (eg. denial-of-service, destruction of coins, forced deanonymization, etc. -- all things that miners *can* do with a softfork), the the PoW algorithm *must* be changed at this point to fire the evil miners and replace them with new ones.
3. Finally, over a long period of time, full nodes upgrade to versions which also enforce the additional restrictions. Only after full nodes representing 50-75% of the economy have upgraded can the rules created by the softfork be considered to be a solid part of the rules of Bitcoin. If only a small portion of the economy enforces it, then it is merely a universally-enforced miner policy, not a consensus rule.
Whenever the consensus rules are changed (softfork or hardfork), this is always an action of the full-node economy, never an action of devs or miners, though both devs and miners *assist* in the process.

Transactions don't reference blocks: they only reference transactions.
You are right about the effects, though. When you receive a block that is invalid based on time, you won't store it as an orphan. You'll just ignore it. But when you receive a block that comes after a block you don't have, you'll request the previous block from the peer who sent you the new block, and you'll check the old block again when you receive it. So you will eventually get all blocks; you'll just be a block or two behind the rest of the network. This prevents you from mining, but it should have no other ill effects.
The handling of this probably could be better.

It's not possible with Lightning. For each satoshi on the Lightning network, at least one satoshi on the Bitcoin network is tied up and unspendable.

I still mostly agree with that post, though I have learned a few things in 2+ years.
I was talking there about "absolutely prohibited changes". Certain changes like increasing the inflation schedule break Bitcoin's promises and are therefore incompatible with the idea of Bitcoin. [See this article I created around that same time as that post]( I still agree with what I said there: increasing the max block size is *compatible* with the idea of Bitcoin. That doesn't mean that it's not extremely dangerous/damaging to attempt a "hostile hardfork", nor does it mean that any such hostile hardfork would be equal to Bitcoin at the time of its creation. Hardforks need to be done with consensus.
I also still think that assurance contracts are sufficient for incentivizing mining.
I also still agree that Mike's view matches Satoshi's views in 2010. Satoshi may well have changed his mind in 5 years, though (as I did), and the unknown current opinions of one man are not especially important anyway.

It's not dangerous at all. High-value transactions with a small data size have very high priority.
@_date: 2016-10-30 01:24:53
Each public key has one private key, and each private key has one public key. The public key can be expressed in (at least) two formats: compressed and uncompressed. Uncompressed public keys start with 04 when written in hex, and compressed public keys start with 02 or 03. But they represent the same public key. 
There are 2^256 public keys, but only 2^160 version-0 addresses, so each address actually represents on average 2^96 different public keys. But the numbers are still so large that attacks are not feasible.


Try not to think of BTC as being sent *from* an address. Sometimes this way of thinking makes a little sense, but it's not correct in general, and thinking in this way will often confuse you.
BTC is sent to a scriptPubKey. There is usually (but not necessarily) a one-to-one mapping between addresses and scriptPubKeys. Given an address, there is usually exactly one scriptPubKey for that address, and given a scriptPubKey there is usually exactly one address matching that scriptPubKey. So if you send *to* an address two times, then both transactions will have the same scriptPubKey.
The scriptPubKey gives the conditions under which the sent BTC can be spent again. For example, one common condition is that you must be able to sign with a particular public key hash. The proof that you meet the required conditions goes in the *scriptSig* -- this proof is also called the *witness*.
So if you send "from" an address twice, then the same public key will appear in one of the *scriptSigs* for each transaction, and if you go to the previous-output being spent, they will have the same scriptPubKeys in *those* transactions. The scriptPubKey has to do with where the BTC is being sent *to*. The scriptPubKey is the lock, and the scriptSig is the key.

A block chain provides *decentralized timestamping*, which is not at all useful in a centralized election in which the ordering/timing of votes doesn't particularly matter.

However, computer security is currently a joke. Think about all of the big companies and even governments that are constantly hacked *despite* putting tons of effort into security. Ordinary people are sitting ducks in comparison, and would have their votes stolen in massive quantities if an election was ever done using home computers.

You are totally wrong.


The paper says nothing of the sort. When Satoshi speaks there about the majority of nodes, he means the majority of mining power, and he means it only in the specific sense of preventing double-spending.


You're right that permissionlessness was one of Satoshi's main goals, but the idea that democracy introduces this is really weird. What I said is far more permissionless than your idea of how Bitcoin should work. No one can ever under any circumstances *force* you to accept violations of Bitcoin rules which you've accepted. This is just about the best possible form of permissionlessness. Any form of democracy would seriously *compromise* this. And thankfully, Bitcoin "by default" does work in the way I've described: if the economic majority accepts a hardfork, then your full node will happily ignore them until you *yourself* manually assent to the rule change.
Keep in mind that I had plenty of communication with Satoshi, and I am part of the group that was appointed by Satoshi to handle bitcoin.org (and bitcointalk.org) after he left. I think I know a thing or two about Satoshi's goals. (This and all Satoshi-centered arguments should not be convincing, but when the core of your argument is "Satoshi wanted ...", it seems appropriate.)

The fact is that Reddit is a terrible platform for discussion which inherently promotes all of the worst things which can afflict a forum (groupthink, spam, ban bypassing, newbie barriers, manipulation, etc.). The only thing that makes large subreddits even remotely usable is significant moderation. Although the idea of a very-lightly-moderated forum is not a bad one in itself, this just isn't possible on a subreddit of any size without ending up with a cesspool. On other platforms, this can work better. For example, bitcointalk.org has much lighter moderation than SouperNerd gave it an honest try. Probably will be even worse without him.

Probably it was discussed in depth on the mailing list somewhere, but I get most of my dev info from IRC, so I don't have links off-hand.
But basically, it was realized that the limit on the non-witness max block size is the only thing limiting the number of UTXOs that a block can create. This is important because:
* Even *pruned* full nodes need to store UTXOs forever.
* The Bitcoin Core UTXO database's performance does not seem to be scaling all that great as the number of UTXOs increases. The performance of this database is one of the key factors in Bitcoin Core's overall performance.
* The UTXO set is already growing worryingly quickly.
Personally, I think it'd be reasonable to at least temporarily add another arbitrary hard limit like the max block size on the net number of UTXOs that a block can create. But others feel that this is too kludgy and significantly complicates things, especially in the area of fee prediction where transaction-senders will have little idea about how many net UTXOs are already in miners' blocks. A much more elegant solution is known, called TXO commitments, which allows full nodes to almost entirely forget about most UTXOs (`O(log(n))` storage) without preventing them from being spent, but this is a pretty complex change, and only very little work has been done on it.

* The agreement didn't guarantee absolute timing.
* The agreement was between some people and some other people, not between some people and the community as a whole.
* Hardforks are done by the Bitcoin community, not by devs -- devs cannot agree to do a hardfork. This is also plainly explained in the agreement.
* When the agreement was made, the participants were probably talking about the hardfork proposed by BlueMatt (one of the Core devs participating in the HK agreement) of setting MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB while *simultaneously* reducing the SegWit discount from 75% to 50%. The "effective" max block size is 1 MB now, 1.7 - 4 MB with just SegWit, and 2.1 - 3 MB with SegWit plus BlueMatt's hardfork. The small change in effective block size compared to SegWit is why such a hardfork could possibly get consensus. However, later discussion/research revealed that the additional UTXO creation allowed by this approach compared to SegWit alone might require additional mitigations.

You're welcome!


You might be able to remove the addnode now. I guess that Core's peer discovery is somehow either broken or very slow with onlynet=onion, but your node should now have a list of other onions that you can peer with.


I think that it might be fairly easy to do a denial-of-service attack against all Bitcoin onion nodes because there aren't all that many of them and Tor offers no way of protecting against DoS attacks. Also, Core tries to defeat Sybil attacks (ie. getting entirely surrounded by attacker nodes) in part by connecting to IPs that are far away from each other, but that doesn't work with onions. So those are some theoretical issues to think about. But otherwise it should work just fine.

You followed bad advice. See my comment here: 
Unfortunately, now it's a bit complicated. You need to:
* Find all of the deleted unconfirmed transactions which you sent using some block explorer. (You don't need to do anything about deleted unconfirmed transactions which you received.) For each of them, do the following steps.
* On the block explorer, note down all of the input addresses.
* In Bitcoin Core, go to Settings -&gt; Wallet -&gt; check enable coin control features.
* Go to the send tab. Click the inputs button. Select "tree mode"
* Check any *one* of the input addresses found above. You'll want the one which results in the lowest fees. Do not expand any of the addresses to select only some of the address's coins -- you need to spend them all for this particular maneuver to work. (It's possible to do it by selecting just one input, but it's complicated to explain how to find the exact one you need.)

If you produce one out of every five blocks, you could use this attack to double your BTC overnight.
* Generate a block, but do not broadcast it.
* Send 20,000 BTC to MyBitcoin.
* Wait for one confirmation.
* Withdraw the 20,000 BTC.
* Start building an alternative block chain that includes an alternative version of your MyBitcoin deposit that sends the BTC back to an address you control. You already have the first block done, so you have a one in five chance of succeeding. If you fail, you can just repeat the process with no loss.
* MyBitcoin has now sent you 20,000 BTC, but your deposit to them is no longer valid. You've doubled your money.
I'm really surprised no one has tried this yet. You'd probably have to invest a lot of money to get network % and BTC, but it would be very profitable.

@_date: 2016-10-27 04:31:15
I don't think that'd be profitable. If a miner publicly broadcasts a fee-paying transaction, then it can be claimed by any miner, so they'll lose money. If they put it only in one of their own blocks, then Bitcoin Core at least will not consider it for fee estimation purposes.
Miners *could* just refuse to create blocks over x kB. Bitcoin Core even has configuration options for doing this. But miners only make money from this (by forcing fees up) if many miners do it -- just one miner doing it will probably lose more by leaving fee-paying transactions on the table.


Unconfirmed transactions don't expire. Until the coins being spent in an unconfirmed transaction are spent in a different confirmed transaction, it can be confirmed at any time, even years later. If your wallet says that transactions do expire, then it is dangerously lying to you, and this could cause you to lose money.
@_date: 2015-11-29 01:42:39
Probably not much additional wallet support is necessary. 0-confirmation transactions have always been totally insecure, and this is how all wallets should (and, AFAIK, typically do) handle them. For example, long before this change occurred, Bitcoin Core would by default refuse to spend any incoming 0-conf bitcoins.
Relying on 0-conf transactions being hard to reverse is an insecure hack that has never been recommended. The opt-in nature of this change allows services that still incorrectly rely on this model to continue running unchanged, but the future is RBF. Nothing is lost by RBF (since 0-conf transactions have always been 100% insecure), but certain things like revising fees are made much easier.
(I don't think that the ecosystem is ready yet for wallets to be sending RBF-enabled transactions by default, but this'll be appropriate someday.)

Not in a meaningful way IMO. It's not as if miners are offering a product, and Bitcoiners can choose between them so that the market finds the best ones. There's not really a market of mining policies or softforks or whatever, unfortunately.


In practice, how it would probably work is that the ASIC-friendly section would be controlled by rather centralized ASIC miners as today, the ASIC-unfriendly section would be controlled by rather centralized botnet operators, and the PoS section would be controlled by rather centralized early-adopters. But importantly these would very likely be three *different* groups, improving mining decentralization overall in a hybrid scheme requiring all three groups.
Whether an ASIC-unfriendly algorithm actually *exists* has long been a topic of debate. For example, it was long suspected that bcrypt and scrypt would not hold up, and these concerns were later proven justified -- ASICs for these algorithms were created after their respective altcoins gained enough value. However, several experts think that tromp's cuckoo algorithm (created especially with Bitcoin in mind) might actually solve the problem of making an algorithm that is efficient on general-purpose computers but not on ASICs.


My hybrid scheme might prevent evil miners from actually doing much evil, which would help.
If something like my hybrid scheme is not adopted, or if it doesn't work very well, then the PoW should be changed as often as necessary until evil miners learn that they're only throwing away their money.

XT has a rule "after the threshold, these old rules no longer exist". That violates the core rules of Bitcoin, even if it happens to work for now.
I would take the same position even if I knew that the changes in XT were objectively perfect in all cases. If hard fork changes are not appropriately difficult, and can be done by 75% of miners or a mere majority of users or something like that, then the hard, "mathematical" guarantees that we have about Bitcoin such as coin ownership and limited supply are pretty much worthless. Why should a bitcoin be worth anything if it doesn't have any *really* hard rules/limits attached to it at all, and anything can be changed by a majority of some distant/clueless group?
You can find posts of mine since as far back as 2010 in this same vein. For example, [I was probably the first person ever to discourage this sort of hardfork]( A more exact/explicit example is when I [said]( in late 2014, "Nodes that have different consensus rules are actually using two different networks/currencies."

People need to be paid. The potential for conflicts of interest isn't really avoidable. 
If it becomes clear that some group is opposing something for no good reason, then they can be ignored. If, for example, convincing statistical data is presented which shows that BIP 101 will not make running a node any more difficult, and Blockstream continues to oppose it without a good reason, then they should probably be ignored. But we're nowhere close to that sort of situation now. The arguments against BIP 101 are reasonable (even if you don't agree with them), and it seems extremely unlikely that all of the *many* experts opposed to BIP 101 are part of some conspiracy or are otherwise compromised.

By "promotes XT to customers on coinbase.com" I meant a situation where, for example, everyone using Coinbase would see a message like, "An upgrade to Bitcoin is required!!", pointing to XT. In that case, any link to coinbase.com would probably by itself constitute promotion of non-consensus hardfork software, which is not allowed. I'm not saying that all of Coinbase would be banned if they encouraged usage of XT on some coinbase.com blog or something like that. (And in fact they've basically already done that.) However, if it is unclear whether Coinbase is actually using Bitcoin or not, their public statements regarding XT might be taken into account as we try to accurately guess what they're doing.
Also, the rule against promoting non-consensus hardforks doesn't exist on bitcointalk.org, so this part doesn't apply there.

The way block explorer sites show things tends to confuse newbies. Addresses are a high-level concept, and barely even exist in the real Bitcoin protocol. The idea of an "address balance" is especially problematic, and not really a correct/reliable/useful way of thinking.
If you receive 8 BTC in one transaction, imagine that you have one 8 BTC gold coin. Then if you want to send 7 BTC, the *only* way to do it is to melt down your 8 BTC gold coin and recast it into a 7 BTC coin and a 1 BTC coin. You give the 7-coin to the recipient and keep the 1-coin as *change*. That's how Bitcoin works: each time you receive BTC you're receiving one coin, and when you want to spend it you melt down as many input coins as you need in order to produce (usually) two output coins. Addresses are something separate from all this --in the analogy, they can maybe be thought of as part of a vault which stores these gold coins. Bitcoin transactions are not at all like crediting one account and debiting the other. 
A wallet is a collection of addresses. You should ideally *not* use an address more than once. Addresses are meant to be used one-per-transaction. Electrum generated a new address for your change.

Your perception of how softforks work seems incorrect. See my recent post about this [here]( In particular, it's important to realize that miners are not some sort of legislative body representing Bitcoin users and voting on proposals laid before them. Miners are employees of the network, motivated mainly by profit, and they have no constituency. It's not a problem for Bitcoin as a whole if miners are somehow treated unfairly or whatever.
In the case of this softfork, miners are able to enforce the softfork because there is enough agreement within the community that doing so will not cause the miners to be fired. If miners were instead doing something crazy, such as requiring that all Bitcoin users submit identity info to the Chinese government if they want any transactions confirmed (something that is entirely possible in a softfork), then the PoW would need to be changed. Bitcoin does not rely on the majority of miners *never* being evil, just that when they *are* evil, the community must be able to change the PoW and fire them. (In fact, if the community is unable to fire miners, then miners have very little incentive to not do evil things.)
Years ago, these sames sorts of discussions happened in regard to the P2SH softfork, which was controversial. I argued at the time that if miners would refuse to do it, then they should be forced to do it, though it turned out that this wasn't necessary with P2SH. (A softfork can be done without miner approval, though then it's about as difficult as a hardfork.)

Probably over a hundred people have proposed this very thing, and it's been discussed for many years. Bitcoin would not collapse if it had 5-minute blocks, but for scaling, halving the block interval is strictly inferior to just increasing the max block size to 2 MB. And for ease-of-use, there's very little difference: both 5 minutes and 10 minutes are unacceptable at point-of-sale, and even with an average interval of 5 minutes, blocks would still take 20+ minutes more than 1% of the time.
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:29:25
The block size issue is controversial because it's a trade-off: larger block sizes allow more tx volume and lower fees, but smaller block sizes guarantee more decentralization and security. If a proposed hardfork change is better in every way, or if ~everyone agrees that it is a net positive change, then it should be easy to get consensus for the hardfork. (Quite some time may still be necessary to ensure that the implementation works correctly, though.) From what I remember of the Scaling Bitcoin presentation, it sounds like maybe bitcoin-ng falls into this category of a good-all-around change that shouldn't be very controversial.
The max block size issue will be one of the most controversial/difficult hardforks. Others will be easier. (In fact, it might be good for the core devs to do a totally non-controversial hardfork change such as turning all of the reserved opcodes into NOP opcodes just to prove that it can be easily done.)

Some of my concerns with this idea are:
* Network nodes don't influence miners very much by delaying blocks. Miners already use a separate relay network amongst themselves. They'll just keep working on their preferred chain until the network finally accepts it, unless the network refuses to *ever* accept it.
* Everyone will just use the software defaults (or popular values suggested by guides, etc.).
* To the extent that people don't use the defaults, they will be picked off one-by-one by increasing block sizes unless they act in a more unified way.
Over a year ago, I put forward a vaguely similar idea which addresses the above problems:  . However, I still tend to think that a single global limit would be better.

The NSA put forward a cryptographic random number generator based on elliptic-curve cryptography called Dual_EC_DRBG. Its construction was suspicious enough that tons of people thought right away that it could have a backdoor, so it was never widely used -- the only real-world usage example I know of is in certain software released by RSA Corp., who apparently did so under the influence of the NSA. Later on, Snowden revealed definitively that it did have a backdoor. The backdoor was not in elliptic-curve crypto itself, but in the way it was used in this particular random number generator.
There is no known way that anyone could've inserted a backdoor or other master key in Bitcoin's crypto. All of the important constants in the ECDSA curve used by Bitcoin, secp256k1, were selected using a predictable process which seems to preclude any backdoor. Furthermore, secp256k1 was not designed by the NSA/NIST, but by the independent SECG industry consortium.

You're assuming that:
* The current total mining power is the *ideal* total mining power. In reality, Bitcoin is far out of the reach of any reasonably likely mining-based attacker other than the (rather centralized) miners themselves. I think that it'd be fine to reduce the total mining power to 25% or less of its current value, which allows for reducing the mining reward by at least a similar proportion.
* Miners will only make money from fees. I think that miners might be able to make money from things like assurance contract donations rather than just fees.
* The max block size will stay at 1 MB. In fact, SegWit will increase it to 4 MB in the near future (but introducing the concept of limited "weight" per block, which means that it probably won't quadruple the transaction capacity).
But even if you want 12.5 BTC per 1 MB block, that means an average transaction fee of about 1250 sat/B. That's $2.73 for a "standard transaction" of 333 bytes, far less than an international wire transfer. On a multi-layer protocol involving sidechains, Lightning, etc., it does not seem totally unreasonable.

* BIP 101 is terrible and inherently dangerous.
* If the majority of miners adopt BIP 101, they will leave Bitcoin. This does not affect Bitcoin except for temporarily-increased confirmation times and reduced total mining power (still out of the reach of any realistic attacker). Full nodes ignore non-Bitcoin miners no matter how much mining power they have.
* If, say, 51% of the economy adopts BIP 101 and 75% of miners do as well (this sort of economy-miner split is possible -- for example BIP 65 is supported by ~50% of miners but only ~20% of nodes right now), then you're splitting the Bitcoin economy 49-51. If you think that shattering the Bitcoin ecosystem like this can cause anything but havoc, severely reduced prices, etc., then you're nuts. (You might somewhat-reasonably argue that things will become better in the *long-term* due to this, though the vast majority of Bitcoin experts disagree with you: there's a good chance that BIP 101 itself is so bad that it will destroy Bitcoin's good properties, and the precedent that a slight majority can completely change any of Bitcoin's "hard rules" should significantly diminish anyone's faith in Bitcoin as well.)

I only know the basics of RSK, but from what I understand:
RSK is a federated sidechain, which [I've mentioned before]( as one method of quick-and-dirty scaling. Due partly to its semi-centralized structure, on-chain RSK transactions are cheap and near-instant. And because it's a sidechain rather than an altcoin, you can convert between RSK and BTC at a fixed exchange rate. So RSK could be a major breakthrough which completely solves the small-value BTC transaction problem. People would use RSK as a sort of checking account, while keeping most of their BTC in their Bitcoin-proper "savings account".
However, it's only going to work well if it's sufficiently easy to use. Nobody uses theoretically-good stuff like Open Transactions or raw Bitcoin payment channels because the tools are too clunky. So we'll see.

With stealth addresses, the sender basically encrypts a new private key in a way that the recipient can decrypt and sends it along with their transaction. The recipient must then scan all transactions on the block chain to find incoming transactions.
With BIP 47, the sender first negotiates a shared secret with the recipient via the block chain. Then using elliptic curve math along with this shared secret, the sender can generate very many addresses for this recipient, and the recipient can generate the private keys that are associated with these addresses. Both the sender and recipient will generate addresses in the same order, so the recipient can just watch for transactions to the next address in the sequence. Like stealth addresses, there is no publicly-computable link between the recipient's public identity and these derived addresses, which provides some privacy advantages.
This is claimed to be better for SPV users because the recipient can just use the "normal way" of finding incoming transactions instead of scanning the entire block chain. You're just watching a list of regular Bitcoin addresses, after all. But the thing is, the "normal way" is terribly insecure. SPV wallets send a bloom filter of all of their addresses to *untrusted* network peers, relying on them to forward relevant transactions, but bloom filters have been shown to leak information like crazy. If you're using SPV and you happen to connect to someone who is watching you long-term, it's likely that they will be able to construct a list of many of the addresses in your wallet, which can deanonymize you even if you're using Tor. Stealth addresses are typically used in the same way (the wallet asks a server somewhere to do the processing for them, compromising anonymity), so I don't see much real-world advantage anonymity-wise compared to stealth addresses.
I think that BIP 47 is probably superior to stealth addresses. It does result in less transaction data than stealth addresses overall if the sender will ever send more than one transaction to a given recipient, and (though I'm not an expert on it,) it seems better-thought-out in general. And it's better than the current status quo of widespread address reuse. But hopefully something better will be created. In particular, it should be possible to set up this sort of thing without touching the block chain at all, which would be much better for efficiency/scalability and anonymity.

Core's support or lack thereof means a lot, but a UASF or hardfork could be done without Core *if* you had a lot of lead-up time, and at this point I'm not sure that even Core's support could cause BIP 148 to succeed without a lot of extra help.
A successful UASF or hardfork deployment relies upon two main factors:
1. Time between when the push to upgrade starts and the activation time.
2. Support by default in software that people already use, so people will support the change naturally as part of their normal software-upgrade regime.

The Bitcoin *currency* could handle 100% of the world's transactions with 250kB blocks forever. However, in this case probably not everyone would be able to use Lightning (which requires some on-chain transactions), so some of these transactions would have to use more centralized or less secure off-chain systems such as [high-volume sidechains]( or [blinded bearer certificates]( However, unless Bitcoin grows unbelievably quickly, I think that fees will be low enough for almost everyone to use Lightning. The max block size is increasing to ~2-4 MB with SegWit, and it will continue to increase in the future as technological improvements (in Bitcoin and elsewhere) allow for safely doing so.

IIRC the attack they describe is that an attacker can fairly easily get all Tor exit nodes except ones controlled by them automatically banned from all Bitcoin nodes by behaving badly, and then everyone using Tor will connect only to the attacker. Whenever your Bitcoin node is completely surrounded by an attacker, you're screwed in many different ways.
This attack doesn't work with hidden services (which is what 0.12 sets up) because there are no exit nodes with hidden services. This change may in fact be partly in *response to* that paper. Though on the other hand, if someone is DoS-attacking you via a hidden service, there's no way to IP ban them (which is what happens with clearnet connections); maybe this will cause problems. IMO Tor should really have built-in PoW for hidden service connections. There's also talk of someday adding a sort of PoW (proof of storage, specifically) to Bitcoin connections in order to prevent DoS attacks.

If BIP148 fails to get much economic support, then anyone who runs a BIP148 client will end up hard-rejecting the economically-supported chain. At that point you'll be on an irreconcilably different currency, an altcoin. Even if you replace your BIP148 software with non-BIP148 software after that point, the real chain will be marked as invalid, though it might be possible to fix it with the `reconsiderblock` command.
While I would be very happy if BIP148 succeeded, I really doubt that it will, so I can't recommend running BIP148 software. Doing so will likely cause you to break away from the real Bitcoin currency on the flag day, create a mess of your datadir which you'll need to manually clean up, and theoretically there are opportunities for losses due to counterfeit BTC (but in reality this is unlikely). 
It won't have much mining power, so it may just completely die out. If it has *enough* of the economy (but not enough to actually avoid being an altcoin), then there may be enough interest to do a hardfork on the BIP148 currency to adjust the difficulty or change the PoW. Or perhaps if the BIP148 coin trades high enough, sufficient Bitcoin miners (at least a few percent) will mine the BIP148 altcoin to keep it alive until difficulty adjustment. Then it could trade separately from BTC.

All Bitcoin transactions must eventually be put into a block. Currently the max block size is fixed at 1 MB. That is, 1 MB of transactions can be processed by Bitcoin every 10 minutes or so. Pretty much everyone agrees that 1 MB is sub-optimal, at least in the long-term, but there's very little agreement about how to fix this. BIP 101 is one proposal for increasing the max block size. It increases the max block size according to a fixed schedule.
The smaller blocks are, the higher transaction fees will be because transactions will have to compete for scarce block space. It's not known exactly how fees will react, but a lot of people are worried that the fees required to get your transaction confirmed will in the near future shoot up to fairly high levels (tens of USD cents per kB, maybe) over a short period of time due to increasing demand for transactions, which could make it a lot more difficult for people to use Bitcoin.
So we should just increase the max block size and be done with it, right? Unfortunately not. There's a major trade-off associated with raising the max block size. As actual block sizes get larger, it becomes more and more difficult/expensive to run a full node. If not enough of the economy runs full nodes, then Bitcoin is [totally insecure]( Miners probably don't have the right incentives to keep block sizes sufficiently small on their own, so probably some sort of network-enforced max block size is necessary. It's not known how many full nodes are "enough" for security or exactly how changing the max block size will affect the number of full nodes, though, which complicates the problem significantly.
So we need to somehow create a schedule for max block sizes that will allow for the lowest possible transaction fees, but without ruining Bitcoin's security. This is really difficult, since it involves a lot of prediction of the future without a lot of good data. Also, some people believe that we additionally need to introduce artificial scarcity into blocks so that miners will get *enough* fees to do enough mining (which secures the network), though I suspect that this won't actually be necessary.
IMO BIP 101 increases the max block size at a suicidally fast rate. If it was adopted, in a short period of time only the largest companies would run full nodes anymore. [This is really really bad.](
There are other better proposals such as BIP 103, but there's no perfect solution yet. Things like Lightning, a "caching layer" on top of Bitcoin, are probably the best way to achieve Visa-level volumes in the long-term. (I am not very optimistic about sidechains, another idea for scaling.)

When I imagine a fully-integrated and ideal Lightning ecosystem, I think that fees will look mostly like a subscription. Like it'll be $10/year plus $0.01 for every 1000 transactions, or something in that general vein. Does that address your concern? (Though I'm not so convinced that people couldn't deal with micro-fees.)
Seeing Luke and gmaxwell on the chart makes me think that your test is pretty effective and your axes actually somewhat meaningful, since I know from talking with them that their philosophies do roughly correspond to where they are positioned on the graphic.

70 is a lot, and that much isn't typical. If everyone was seeing 70 connections all the time, that'd be somewhat worrisome since it's approaching the default maximum of 125. (If everyone has ~125 connections, the network will be "full" and everyone will have various problems.)
You're probably on a network that doesn't have many other full nodes. Bitcoin Core likes to connect to distinct networks.
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:15:03
[The fee market doesn't work in general]( If blocks are big enough to eliminate scarcity for block space, then total fees will likely be much smaller than they need to be for security, probably approaching zero. If blocks are kept artificially small, at least a certain amount of fees will be guaranteed, though the amount of fees may still be too small. However, I think that assurance contracts (proposed by Mike Hearn) can solve this, so I don't worry about fees too much.
The real issue is that making blocks too large makes it too difficult/expensive to run a full node, and if not enough of the Bitcoin economy is backed by full nodes, Bitcoin is totally insecure. [See my comment here](

Lightning requires occasional on-chain transactions, so a typical user of Lightning might need to spend perhaps $0.10-$1.00 in total fees per month due to these on-chain transactions. (I'm unclear as to how many on-chain transactions will be required, so I can't estimate the monthly cost very precisely.)
For people who can't afford even this much, an even more efficient transaction method might be necessary. One extremely efficient way is blinded bearer certificates, in which a bank holds BTC and issues certificates entitling the bearer to withdraw those bitcoins. The "bank" can actually be multiple independent entities using multisig, and the bank's reserves can be audited, so this might be reasonably secure for small amounts. And using blind signing, this can also be far more anonymous than anything else. You'd trade certificates directly until you accumulated certificates worth at least a few dollars, and then you could withdraw either on-chain or via Lightning. The market could have many certificate-issuing banks, and if you had a mixture of different certificates, it'd easily be possible to automatically trade them on the market in order to accumulate enough at one bank for a withdrawal. Your wallet could also automatically trade certificates in order to diversify amongst all of the certificate-issuers you trust, further increasing the scheme's security.

I think that what bangers89 means by elasticity is that the money supply in Bitcoin follows a fixed schedule in Bitcoin, unlike in fiat currencies where the central bank can expand or shrink the money supply in response to economic conditions. Due to Bitcoin's inelasticity here, some economists would worry about deflation/inflation, but I don't think that this is actually a problem. See:  . I especially find it convincing to consider that gold is inelastic in a similar way to Bitcoin, but there are examples of successful monies based on gold throughout history.
Divisibility is something different. Bitcoin's current divisibility might not be sufficient if it *totally* takes over, but that can be fixed in a number of ways. Some of the Lightning developers are working on an interesting scheme where you can transfer sub-satoshi amounts via Lightning, but then once these sub-satoshi amounts need to be realized on the real block chain, they actually appear only with a certain probability. For example, sending someone 0.75 satoshi would mean that they get 1 satoshi 75% of the time and 0 satoshi 25% of the time, with an *expected value* equal to 0.75 satoshi.

* The long-term ability of Bitcoin to provide anonymity

because I think that these properties of Bitcoin will, if Bitcoin becomes widespread, massively improve the world's economy and level of freedom, which would be very good. (And before anyone says it: my non-violent actions on a private website do not contradict the idea of freedom in general.)
Therefore, I am interested in helping Bitcoin to succeed, but not in ways that might compromise those properties. Non-consensus hardforks compromise all of those properties because they make Bitcoin's "hard rules" too soft. Any rule that requires a hard fork to change *should* be extremely difficult to change or else bitcoin as a currency is basically worthless.

At first, probably you will have two wallets: a Bitcoin wallet and a Lightning wallet. You will use your Bitcoin wallet like a savings account and your Lightning wallet like a checking account, periodically moving BTC between them. In very early Lightning wallets, you might need to manually help its routing / channel creation to some extent.
Currently I don't think that there's any standard payment protocol for Lightning, but probably it will be similar to Bitcoin except that the addresses might be a little longer.

It's not particularly helpful for the network if you just run a full node on a server somewhere. The most important function that full nodes perform is that they ensure that your "economic weight" enforces/follows all of the Bitcoin currency rules. This only happens if you're actually using the full node when you use Bitcoin in everyday life. It's also best if the node is (as much as reasonably possible) physically under your control. See [here]( and [here]( for more info about this.
Also, nodes won't connect to peers in the same Internet neighborhood, so when you put a node in a place with a high concentration of nodes like EC2, you'll get far fewer incoming connections and you'll be helping the network's capacity less.
So to maximize the amount that you help the network, you should ideally set up the full node at home or in a nearby trustworthy data center. Use this node for all of your Bitcoin transactions, using it either directly as a wallet or as a server for more lightweight wallets. If your home Internet or computers aren't sufficient to do what you want, you could also run a computer at home with -nolisten and connect it to your more powerful server node with -addnode, and then use your home node for Bitcoin transactions and your server node for accepting many incoming connections and for doing more expensive block parser things. This'll be fairly low-bandwidth at home but will provide you and the network with many of the same benefits.

How exchanges work is that they have an *order book* which looks something like:
Buying BTC | Selling BTC
5 BTC @ $600 | 8 BTC @ $610
6 BTC @ $590 | 9 BTC @ $620
7 BTC @ $580 | 10 BTC @ $630
Whenever the two columns overlap in price, the overlapping orders are executed and then either removed from the order book if filled completely, or else the amount reduced if filled partially.
If someone placed an order for *21 million BTC @ $1 million*, all of the entries in the "selling BTC" column would be executed at *their* prices (not $1 million), but then the partially-filled order would remain on the order book:
Buying BTC | Selling BTC
~21 million BTC @ $1 million | (empty)
5 BTC @ $600 | 
6 BTC @ $590 | 
7 BTC @ $580 | 
At this point, anyone could deposit BTC at the exchange and accept $1 million per BTC, since the order will remain on the order book until canceled by the buyer or completely filled, and it will be matched by anyone selling BTC at under $1 million per BTC. Additionally, speculators would probably put down orders to sell BTC at prices even higher than $1 million, creating unexecuted orders on the order book once again. If the buyer has enough money, then there's no reason that this couldn't continue indefinitely, though it's very unlikely to result in anything but a massive loss for the buyer. This order, which would essentially be *backing* BTC with USD, would set a lower limit on the price, but the price could and probably would rise above this lower limit at times. If the buyer kept increasing their price continuously in order to eat up all orders possible, then the BTC price would tend toward infinity until the buyer ran out of money. If hypothetically the Federal Reserve (which has infinite dollars) was the one doing this, then the BTC price would initially tend toward infinity, but then the value of USD would approach zero, and then it'd be as if the Federal Reserve ran out of money even though they still have an infinite amount of worthless USD.
Some exchanges support a type of order called a *market order*, which means that you want to buy x BTC for whatever price you need to pay in order to get that much BTC. If a market order completely wipes out the order book, then how this is handled will depend on the exchange.

They're very different.
Federated or miner-secured sidechains are forms of off-chain transactions. Bitcoin full nodes can ignore such sidechains completely if they want, since they're optional parts of the system, and if a sidechain falls apart, only users of the sidechain are affected. Therefore, it isn't the end of the world is a sidechain uses reckless techniques or is not perfectly decentralized.
I wrote a post about extension blocks [here]( Extension blocks are a way of increasing Bitcoin-proper's on-chain capacity. At least the vast economic majority of Bitcoin full nodes need to download all extension block data or else the Bitcoin system becomes unstable and/or insecure. It's like increasing the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant, but as a softfork rather than a hardfork. As with doing it in a hardfork, increasing the max block size has significant costs. With today's technology (ie. both hardware power and Bitcoin-network technology), you couldn't increase the max block size to 20MB without totally killing decentralization, for example. But it could be appropriate in some circumstances. For example, SegWit is more-or-less an extension block softfork; that's how it increases capacity.
Note that the particular extension blocks proposal pushed by Bitmain and their puppets is garbage specifically intended to interfere with Segwit so that Bitmain can continue using covert Asicboost. While *an* extblocks proposal might be OK in the future (and SegWit basically is one), *this particular* proposal is 100% unacceptable.

The point is that miners *don't* run the network. Miners can enforce new rules with only a majority, but miners can also be fired by the full-node economy. So if they do something evil, it won't last.


Bitcoin is about individual sovereignty. Your full node follows its rules forever, no matter what, even if every other miner and node on the network does otherwise. There's no democracy or rule by miners.
Miners seek to make money by mining blocks that will be accepted by an economically significant section of users. If miners instead create blocks that harm some users, then those users will just stop accepting the miners' blocks by changing the rules to exclude them. Miners should not really be thought of as a decision-making force in Bitcoin, but rather as an outside entity which performs a service for Bitcoin users. If this outside entity attacks itself without particularly harming Bitcoin, then it's not a big deal.
Note that this is not really how Satoshi intended things to work. Satoshi intended basically everyone with a desktop computer to be able to mine, and for mining to be highly decentralized and representative. But things have diverged far away from that now. However, even in the original paper, Satoshi did acknowledge that full nodes could and should ignore invalid blocks even if they are in the longest chain; he didn't treat Bitcoin as ruled by miners. In fact, if you want a cryptocurrency ruled by miners, [it'd be much easier and more efficient](

It is good that you have the freedom to do this. One of the great things about Bitcoin *is* its lack of democracy: even if 99% of people use Bitcoin, you are free to implement BIP 101 in a separate currency without the Bitcoin users being able to democratically coerce you into using the real Bitcoin network/currency again.

That logic would only make sense if the total number of bitcoins on the market was cut in half. That's not necessarily the case.

There's not much difference between loans and bonds in this context.
What increases the money supply is fractional reserve itself. With both bonds and loans, the borrower is receiving money that the depositor still thinks they have. Even with treasury bonds, the US government is receiving the money and then spending it to buy weapons or whatever, so the bank depositor thinks they have money that also exists in some company's bank account after being paid by the government.
Note that this is not unique to fiat currencies. The same effect could be observed with USD or BTC interest-paying deposit accounts. The difference is that with USD, the system as a whole is never going to run out of dollars because the Federal Reserve has infinite dollars and is willing to loan them to banks. If the US banking system instead used BTC, then a huge, widespread bank run could result in the BTC banking system as a whole running out of BTC. I don't view this as a ponzi scheme, since the system *is* sustainable under normal conditions, but just a risk inherent to deposit accounts.

Just buy a hardware wallet like a Trezor, or use a non-Web wallet on a dedicated usually-offline computer. IMO dealing with paper wallets is too error-prone for most people, and using a paper wallet will increase your chance of losing bitcoins more than it will decrease your chance of theft. (Especially if you use a single-key paper wallet, which no one should ever do for any substantial amount of BTC. If you want to use a paper wallet, what you should do is use an HD wallet and write down the mnemonic/seed on paper.)
Blockchain.info is far from ideal because:
* They or someone who hacks their server can change the JavaScript such that it steals your BTC next time you log in.
* You're trusting blockchain.info to give you accurate info. Blockchain.info could say that someone sent you BTC when they really didn't, which could be used to scam you. (This is an especially large risk for automated services, which should *never* trust centralized APIs for this and other reasons.)
* You're trusting that blockchain.info's JavaScript is secure, and that your browser is securely executing it. Blockchain.info is notoriously unreliable, once making a mistake in their random number generator which resulted in user losses. And browsers are also notoriously insecure.
* If your computer becomes infected with malware, it can keylog your blockchain.info password and steal all of your BTC.

The current miners are all using ultra-optimized dedicated ASICs to mine. Changing the PoW turns these ASICs into paperweights. The hardware gold rush starts over.
Also, the new PoW might not be quite the same. For example, I've advocated for a hybrid system combining an ASIC-friendly algorithm (like SHA-3), an ASIC-unfriendly algorithm (like cuckoo), and some sort of proof-of-stake.
Changing the PoW is a hardfork. If miners are doing something evil, getting consensus for the hardfork should not be difficult.

A sidechain is like an altcoin, but with a fixed, network-enforced exchange rate between the altcoin and bitcoins. In fact, a sidechain could in some cases just call its currency "bitcoins", and this would be mostly accurate. This allows the sidechain to do experimental or less safe things without endangering Bitcoin, without the hurdle of marketing its own currency, and without hurting holders of BTC if the sidechain is very successful. For example, a sidechain could support faster block times and less-safe pruning methods to offer cheap microtransactions without increasing risk for normal Bitcoin users at all.
A smart contact is a broad term for a contract that is somehow made better through the use of cryptography. In Bitcoin, it usually refers to things like multisig where some bitcoins can be encumbered such that several people must agree in order to spend them, and this "contract" is enforced by the network without any need to trust your partners in the contract or an arbitrator such as the government. Sometimes the term "smart contract" is used even for things that are not decentralized and do require trust, though.

This is extremely dangerous because even if you delete it from your wallet, the unconfirmed transaction is still floating around on the network and **may be confirmed** at some point. If you do zapwallettxes and then resend the transaction with a higher fee, then **both** transactions may confirm. MtGox famously lost a lot of money this way. If you want to increase the fee for a transaction, then you have to delete it from your wallet and then be sure to spend at least one of the same inputs as the deleted transaction so that the two transactions are mutually exclusive.

The code for this is actually already in Bitcoin, though certain parts of it are currently disabled. Enabling it would be backward-compatible, so it could be enabled at any time.
How it works: You send a transaction with a special option saying, "This transaction is not final until block  The recipient sees it in their client with a status of "Open for x blocks". It can be reversed until then.
(Search for "replacement" and "nLockTime" in the code to see how this works.)

That's similar to asking, "Why devote less money to preventing grey goo nanobots from destroying the Earth? Wouldn't you want to spend more on that?" Yes, it'd be *nice* to have more mining power, but at some point mining power becomes so strong that the cost of paying for more of it outweighs the actual expected benefits, when you consider the actual risks that are being addressed by the expense.
I haven't seen any analyses of how much mining power is "enough", but I suspect that the current amount is already higher than it needs to be.
If you want to maximize transaction fees (which shouldn't actually be anyone's *main* goal), then you need to consider the interaction between the supply of block space (currently capped at 1MB per block) and the demand for block space. Massively increasing the supply to the point where it is essentially infinite would reduce fees to near-zero, probably lowering total fees. Things that aren't scarce have little value, no matter how high the demand. Keeping the supply severely restricted would probably also not be optimal -- very few companies refuse to increase supply in the hope that doing so will allow them to charge more for what supply they do have. For maximizing transaction fees, the optimal level will be somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately, the optimal level probably can't be found by free-market interplay between miners and others because [the incentives aren't right]( But I don't consider miner rewards to be a very interesting problem, especially right now when the subsidy is so high. The real problem is decentralization, and I suspect that whatever limits are necessary for decentralization will also limit block-space supply in a way that is *good enough* for maintaining a sufficient miner reward.


The transactions themselves don't, but each *user* of LN must create on-chain transactions which will have fees. LN will work like a subscription, where you'll get a very low per-transaction fee (paid to LN nodes) in return for $1-20 per year in on-chain fees (paid to miners). Miners will therefore benefit when more *users* adopt Bitcoin/LN.

That's partly why SegWit has the witness discount. Outputs will become somewhat cheaper due to the increased max block size, but inputs will become something like 4x cheaper. This improves the current weird situation where the parts of a transaction which send someone BTC are much cheaper than the parts that actually spend BTC that you've received.
The SegWit discount only applies when spending SegWit outputs, though, so these old outputs would only be helped by the overall SegWit max-block-size increase. But future SegWit outputs-being-spent would get the full benefit.
@_date: 2016-10-07 08:38:33
If the input value of a transaction exactly equals the desired output value plus fees, then there will be only one output. This most commonly happens when you send a transaction which totally empties your wallet, and it can also rarely happen by chance.
Other than that, your transactions will usually have one change output and one real output.

True, that's why I put it in quotes. But making human intervention unnecessary and impossible is the ideal that Bitcoin should strive for. It certainly isn't possible for Bitcoin to survive long-term without any human intervention (=hardforks) in its current state, and therefore it's good that it's not impossible to do a hardfork. But hopefully hardforks will become less and less common/necessary as time goes on. And when hardforks happen, we must be extremely careful to maintain the properties that make Bitcoin valuable.

I suppose we could give it a shot, but I'm not at all optimistic about this.
If flairs are added without any hard, objective rules, then this is going to produce an unprecedented amount of drama. Everyone is going to want a "verified" flair because it distinguishes your comments, but mods are not equipped to verify everyone. So it's going to largely turn into a game of who's friendliest with the mods. Everyone is going to constantly complain about people having or not having flair and why the mods decided to give or not give it to them. Also, should we verify companies like BFL? They're surely *notable*. Won't this give them the undue appearance of being trustworthy?
Why should a person's comments stand out more just because they're an employee of some Bitcoin company? Sure, it's useful to verify someone when they're talking *about* the company, but this doesn't mean that it's reasonable for employees to have their comments distinguished *everywhere*. I suspect that companies will use their flair for advertisement by posting all over the place in order to spread awareness of their brand.

According to getaddr.bitnodes.io, there are 6650 listening full nodes. Assuming they're all using default Bitcoin Core settings, they'll each provide 117 connection slots to the network. SPV nodes typically use 4 connection slots, and full nodes typically use 8. So the network can support a maximum of around 194,513 SPV nodes or 90,606 *non-listening* full nodes at one time. This is roughly the upper limit for the number of network-connected wallets that are online at any one time. (If there were more people online at once than that, people would start seeing various issues.) This doesn't include wallets that don't actually connect to the Bitcoin network, of course.
If I take my long-running listening full node and ignore connections via my Tor hidden service (which is unusual) and apparently-"fake" peers, I currently have incoming connections from 29 full nodes and 7 SPV nodes. So if I assume that my node is typical, it seems reasonable to make a very rough guess that there are at this moment (29\*6650)/8 = 24,106 full nodes (6650 listening) and (7\*6650)/4 = 11,637 SPV nodes (Electrum, Multibit, etc.) connected to the network.

I'm far from a socialist, but I don't think that Bitcoin is incompatible with socialism. If Bitcoin completely took over as the world's main money (and Bitcoin's anonymity improved in expected ways), it would remove or reduce the state's ability to do certain evil things such as inflating the currency, taxing income, and enforcing some victimless crime laws. However, the state could still target large businesses for corporate/sales/payroll taxes. It could also target everyone for property taxes, which no amount of crypto-anarchy is going to allow you to evade. Through these means, a socialist government could still function, though it'd look somewhat different from a socialist government without Bitcoin, and some of its evil might be tempered. Bitcoin is a step in the right direction, but it's not a single magic bullet. Therefore, supporting Bitcoin may be reasonable for a small subset of socialists.
Furthermore, libertarians often have the idea that socialism is ultimately unsustainable, but depending on your definition of socialism, I don't believe that this is true. A society which has only a very small portion of the economy made up of free market activities is generally unstable, but could be maintained indefinitely in a 1984-style dystopia, which is very much *not* impossible. A society with as low as perhaps ~25% free market economic could be completely stable long-term *if* the government can resist burning resources and continually expanding. Historically, all governments which went down this road were unable to resist constantly growing, and once they became more than the economy could bear, they burnt through the country's resources until there was nothing left. But it seems to me theoretically possible that a welfare state could function long-term if it stayed roughly the same over time: ie. it wouldn't constantly grow, it wouldn't destroy resources via regulatory uncertainty or war, and its size would be no more than the economy could bear. In this case it's a ball-and-chain attached to the leg of the economy, but the free market is efficient enough to offset even large setbacks. It may be that it's *democracy* that's unstable, rather than socialism, since the voters inevitably vote to expand government, but almost never vote to reduce it.

They're both very bad IMO because they potentially allow blocks to get so big that it'll be very difficult/expensive to run a full node. If not enough of the economy runs full nodes, then Bitcoin is [totally insecure]( It's not known how many full nodes are "enough" or exactly how changing the max block size will affect the number of full nodes, though, which complicates the problem significantly.
However, the smaller blocks are, the higher transaction fees will be. Again, it's not known exactly how fees will react, but a lot of people are worried that the fees required to get your transaction confirmed will in the near future shoot up to fairly high levels (tens of USD cents per kB, maybe) over a short period of time due to increasing demand for transactions, which could make it a lot more difficult for people to use Bitcoin.
There are other better proposals such as BIP 103, but there's no perfect solution yet.
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:13:01
If he really thought that the network could survive with only a few full nodes, then he was wrong. The network definitely would not be secure if there were only a few big full nodes that somehow supported the whole network. If that happened (and everyone else was using SPV), then miners would have essentially no incentive not to create hundreds of bitcoins for themselves per block (or break the rules in other ways). If everyone is running SPV, then no one would notice this or be able to prevent it. The only reason that lightweight nodes are (somewhat) secure is that the vast majority of the economy is backed by full nodes, so miners wouldn't gain much by trying something like this.
(He may have been talking mostly about miners there. At that time, there was no difference between a full node and a miner.)

I was thinking especially about [this idea]( which is somewhat similar to your idea. (This idea has since been more fleshed-out by the Core devs, but I don't think there's any detailed document about it.) With this, old UTXOs can be completely deleted except for an entry in a hash tree, but they can still be spent by providing about half a KB of extra data per UTXO being spent. For the end-user, the result is that particularly old UTXOs need a somewhat higher fee to spend. For nodes, the result is that the UTXO set's size will be limited to some exact size, and will not grow unbounded. (Limiting the UTXO set to some exact size is not part of jl2012's proposal, but it can be done, and I think it'd make more sense.)
Deleting old UTXOs also helps with scaling in other areas than just the UTXO set size, so I was also thinking of the various other good scaling proposals, such as UTXO commitments, syncing backwards, sharding historical block storage, etc.

SegWit allows miners to create blocks that have the same bandwidth and disk-space costs as a 4 MB block would have today, though a realistic distribution of transactions will make ~2 MB the actual limit if miners aren't being especially evil or stupid. 4 MB is right on the border of what is safe, and even 2 MB will increase the cost to run a full node by quite a bit, which is not good for decentralization. (We desperately need more people, especially businesses, to be relying on full nodes rather than lightweight nodes or centralized APIs, and *increasing* the cost of doing this is very counter-productive.) The disk space problems have already been addressed to some degree with pruning, but there are still unresolved situations in which you can't really enable pruning, and the network as it's currently set up can't work if everyone enables pruning. Improving bandwidth is on the Core roadmap, and there are many good ideas for it, but these ideas are not as solid as SegWit yet.
After SegWit is activated, it'd be nice if miners would restrict the total block size (witness + non-witness) to an average of ~1MB until the bandwidth and disk space issues are improved, but I doubt they actually will...
SegWit *does* massively reduce CPU costs for full nodes compared to just setting MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB.
Another downside is that it's the nature of the free market to use up unused resources, so I expect SegWit's additional capacity to be filled basically immediately. The same would be true of 20MB blocks, probably. This isn't actually a problem -- Bitcoin can work fine even if blocks are *always* full, as long as wallets are aware of the fee market -- but I'm sure that plenty of people will start freaking out again, saying that Bitcoin is dying, etc.

If you're a short-term trader (which I don't particularly recommend...), then it's very likely IMO that the price will return to lower values at some point in the not-too-distant future. It's *possible* that the price is going to rally to the moon and never return, but the chance of this occurring at any particular spike is pretty low.
If you're thinking long-term (which is what I recommend and primarily do myself), then I'd ignore short-term price fluctuations like this. Think of prices as though you only have access to the 5-year price chart. If you want to increase your position in BTC, set a goal of buying x BTC (or y USD in BTC) per week or something, and don't let short-term events persuade you to buy more/less. If you do this over a long enough period of time, the daily changes will average themselves out. Many traders, both in Bitcoin and elsewhere, have lost out significantly by thinking, "This is definitely the peak, better sell everything," or, "This is the best deal I'll ever get, better buy as much as I can right now."
Also, to a large extent I personally think of BTC as being not a vehicle to acquire more USD, but the target currency itself. There's a very good chance IMO that the dollar will not exist in 20 years, and while it's unlikely that BTC will even come close to replacing USD by then, it's a reasonable non-fiat way of storing value for now. Gold has similar properties, and in that case you also probably don't want to imagine buying gold and selling it for more USD, but holding gold long-term and using it in case your local fiat currency becomes worthless.

You can promote/discuss change without creating/promoting a non-consensus hardfork. There's even a weekly sticky dedicated to this for the scaling issue. Once there is [consensus]( the proposed change can be added to Bitcoin.

Probably I was unclear in some way, but I'm not sure how.
To summarize: In the first step of a softfork, miners enforce new rules. If these new rules are insane, then the PoW should be changed and the miners fired. If the new rules are fairly reasonable, then they will be tolerated. Only a majority of miners is required to enforce new rules. Even if the new rules exclude 49% of miners, then that's fine. This isn't an example of a failure of democracy ("two wolves voting to eat the sheep") because Bitcoin is not a democracy, and miners don't vote -- it's just how the business of mining works. If individual miners are harmed or disenfranchised, this is not the same as Bitcoin users in general being harmed of disenfranchised, since miners are a very special, limited, and non-representative class of Bitcoin users.
Just because miners enforce a new rule doesn't mean that this rule suddenly becomes part of the consensus rules. Changes in the consensus rules always come from the full-node economy, not miners or devs. In a typical softfork, *after* miners enforce a new rule, the full-node economy will slowly start to enforce this rule until it has so much enforcement that it becomes part of the consensus rules. But it's not *necessarily* the case that just because miners enforce a rule, this rule will become part of the consensus rules.


Well, what I proposed with P2SH was a little different, and involved the full-node economy enforcing a new rule all at once without miner approval, forcing miners to also enforce the rule if they didn't want to start mining a worthless altcoin. The SegWit thing is different because possibly a majority of miners will force a minority of miners to do something, rather than full nodes forcing miners to do something. I included that paragraph about P2SH to reference the overall idea that the full-node economy makes the rules, not miners, and also in case you wanted to look up past discussions from during the P2SH softfork.

The point of the 95% threshold is to ensure that a bunch of invalid blocks aren't floating around post-activation, screwing up old and lightweight nodes. Ideally 95% of miners will actually upgrade, but if not, a simple majority of miners can just start rejecting non-SegWit blocks to bring the percentage to 100%. (Merely refusing to build *directly* on top of non-SegWit blocks would also have a large effect, but would be easier to coordinate.) Either way, the high threshold makes it very unlikely that many invalid blocks will be produced post-activation.
Miners are employees of the network. They don't vote or have any other special decision-making ability. In softforks they *signal readiness*.

If a SegWit block is 4MB, then it would take at least 4 1MB blocks to fit the transactions that caused the 4MB block. If SegWit gives 1.7x scaling on average, then blocks will be 1.7x the size on average. If SegWit blocks are 4x the size on average (basically impossible in reality), then SegWit will be providing 4x scaling on average.

Centralization of the *base system* is the main problem.

Wrecking the base system for short-term gains is therefore a terrible idea, while using sub-optimally centralized upper-level systems is an OK stop-gap until full decentralization is achievable.

With a federated sidechain, the whole sidechain has third-party risk. The sidechain relies on some m-of-n of notaries (aka functionaries). If enough notaries collude, then they can steal all BTC currently locked up on the sidechain. This is far from ideal, but if the multisig arrangement is composed of many independent entities, it can still be pretty good, and in many cases more decentralized than Bitcoin mining, even.
The fixed-rate conversion is an inherent part of the system, and doesn't require any additional centralization. It's done through a special sequence of Bitcoin and sidechain on-chain transactions.

Bandwidth actually isn't that important. 0.5 Mbps upload is probably fine, and Bitcoin won't usually use nearly that much. However, if someone is downloading the chain from you, Bitcoin will attempt to use all of your bandwidth. There isn't built-in support for bandwidth limiting yet. (But if you use Linux, you can use [tc.sh](
Uptime and a fairly static IP are more important, but you don't need to be paranoid about it. 95% uptime and an IP that changes every few weeks is OK.
If you're actually going to use Bitcoin Core for transactions (either directly or as a server for lightweight wallets), just do it. Don't worry about using network resources. You don't even need to port forward 8333 if this is inconvenient or too expensive. (Bitcoin Core uses very little bandwidth after the initial sync if you don't forward 8333.) Using Bitcoin Core improves Bitcoin's ["economic strength"]( and provides you with extra security, even if you're not directly contributing resources to the network.

A similar idea is blinded bearer certificates, which I think would be a good idea. With these certificates, a bank holds BTC and issues certificates entitling the bearer to withdraw those bitcoins. The "bank" can actually be multiple independent entities using multisig, and the bank's reserves can be audited, so this might be reasonably secure for small amounts. Whenever you transfer the certificate's ownership, you have to register this with the bank, but blind signing is used to prevent the bank from getting any useful information about the transfer. As a result, these certificates are more anonymous than anything else, even Mimblewimble. As with Lightning, transferring certificates would be nearly free and instant.
Blinded bearer certificates have the following advantages over Lightning:
* More anonymous.
* BTC might not get tied up as much as it will with Lighting.
* In order to use Lightning, you will still have to send a small handful of on-chain transactions every now and then, which could result in perhaps $0.10-$1 in fees per month. Very poor people might not be able to afford this.
* It's less complicated than Lightning, and could be fairly easily set up right now.
Whereas Lightning has the major advantage of being decentralized and trustless.
For micropayments, it could be the practice to send/receive certificates directly until you accumulated certificates worth at least a few dollars, and then you could withdraw either on-chain or via Lightning. The market could have many certificate-issuing banks, and if you had a mixture of different certificates, it'd easily be possible to automatically trade them on the market in order to accumulate enough at one bank for a withdrawal. Your wallet could also automatically trade certificates in order to diversify amongst all of the certificate-issuers you trust, further increasing the scheme's security.
It's kind of a shame that this wasn't done several years ago. The technology was all there (the concept of blinded bearer certificates was invented in *1983*). Now Lightning isn't too far away, and will offer many (but not all) of the same advantages.

Yeah, probably something like that. Accepting 0-conf transactions is fine when you can take back whatever you gave to the customer.

(It would be OK to accept an order right away with a 0-conf transaction and then just check it again right before actually mailing the product.)
Note that RBF is not required to reverse a payment, and IIRC BitPay will always force 1 confirmation if it sees the RBF flag anyway. It's only slightly difficult to reverse a 0-conf transaction even without RBF.

Trump is in no way libertarian. I think that you could reasonably argue that he's slightly better than Clinton would be, but I am disappointed that anyone who calls himself libertarian would actively support someone who:
* Wants to execute Snowden, a hero to the cause of liberty.
* Believes in "loosening" libel laws.
* Wants to keep troops in various places indefinitely (eg. Afghanistan), and wants to continue US bombing of the Middle East.
* Wants to create barriers to international trade, such as tariffs.
Occasionally he says something that could be interpreted as a libertarian position. At times, he has seemed to be pretty non-interventionist, for example. But he says all sorts of contradictory things, so it's difficult to tell what he'll actually do if elected president. I think that most people latch onto him due to his interesting personality, and then they pick-and-choose which statements of his to believe and which to ignore as "just political stuff that he *has* to say" or "something that was misinterpreted". You see this from people of all political persuasions, which is why Trump has such popularity. All of Trump's supporters think that he's someone different, and likely none of these perceptions are accurate.
I am enjoying this presidential race a lot from an entertainment perspective, but there is no likely-to-win candidate who is even *decent* from a libertarian perspective.

If they default, it's not very bad unless you own Puerto Rico bonds. Bondholders lose their investment, and Puerto Rico appropriately becomes unable to borrow any more money for some time. Note that Puerto Rico has had a very poor credit rating for over a year, so investors in their bonds should have known that this was likely.
I don't think that this event alone will be very notable at all for most people, but perhaps it signals future troubles. The US financial system is very fragile, due in part to weird non-free-market guarantees by the federal government. For example, banks in Puerto Rico are (I think) FDIC-insured. Because many banks in Puerto Rico probably own Puerto Rico bonds, many banks could go bankrupt due to this default, and the FDIC will have to pay their depositors. If many states were to default at once, the FDIC (which doesn't *really* operate using actuarial data as a real insurance company would) could be at risk of going bankrupt. If that happens, because the FDIC is backed by the full faith and credit of the US, the US will have to borrow (which usually means "print") tons of USD in order to cover the expenses. This in turn could lead to hyperinflation, which would cause massive worldwide economic issues. (I consider hyperinflation far more likely than any sort of bail-in scenario in the US.)

I'm not talking about creating just one big Bitcoin bank/certificate-issuer, but rather a system for any group to issue the necessary certificates. So there'd be no need for any sort of widespread agreement: someone just has to start issuing certificates, and other people can use them or not.
Ideally, the banks would each have a multisig setup composed of many clearly-independent entities. But that's just the ideal. You could do it with 3 or even 1 entities to start out with. Even if someone just whipped up a totally-centralized 1-of-1 version and put it on a Tor hidden service, it would probably see a lot of use despite the high risk of theft. The advantages (instant transfers, near-zero fees conducive to microtransactions, and perfect anonymity) are just too good. (Someone actually did this once for a brief period several years ago, but a flaw was found in their crypto which caused them to close down, and it was closed source so nobody could easily set up a fixed version. Though the underlying concepts are well-known, so I'm a little surprised that nobody else has tried it since then AFAIK.)

It's because the market cap is calculated as &lt;total coins&gt; \* &lt;price per coin&gt;, and there are billions of XRP held by the Ripple creators and kept off the market. Since only a very tiny percentage of XRP is actually on the market, the price is much higher than if all XRP was allowed on the market, and so the market cap is massively inflated. The true Ripple market cap is less than a few million dollars, IMO. Many other altcoins do the same trick in order to seem to have much larger economies than they actually do, though Ripple has long specialized in this method of deception.
It's also worth noting that XRP is a fully-electronic, private fiat currency, not a real cryptocurrency. It's completely centralized, all of the XRP were created by the Ripple creators, etc. It's like if Paypal created a Paypal-bucks currency.

You send a special Bitcoin transaction which locks up your BTC. This allows you to create a special RSK transaction which creates RSK tokens. You can move your RSK tokens around on the RSK chain as much as you want. When you want to get your BTC back, you create a special RSK transaction which destroys RSK tokens and allows you to claim the equivalent amount of BTC from the BTC that has previously been RSK-locked by anyone.
There are a few different ways of actually doing the above. RSK seems to use a unique approach, but currently it's similar to the normal federated approach where the locking up of BTC is handled by a centralized multisig arrangement. This is not ideal, but it should be reasonably secure if there are many independent members of the multisig. (I don't know what their multisig arrangement actually is, though.) They've also talked about moving away from the federated approach to a miner-run approach at some point, which I think is a terrible idea, since it would allow miners to steal all BTC on the sidechain, and there aren't strong incentives to prevent them from doing so.

You can write a simple Bitcoin node in less than a thousand lines. Your program could print transactions and blocks as they come through the network, for example. This is actually a pretty good exercise in object-oriented programming, since protocol messages work neatly as objects, especially in Bitcoin. You'll have to do a little extra work because Bitcoin uses a lot of unsigned types and byte arrays, which Java doesn't like, but it's certainly achievable. Use this page for reference: 
If you want to put a lot of time into it, it might be possible for you to make a simple BitcoinJ-style wallet in a month. The hardest part of this will be signing a transaction, which in Bitcoin involves a lot of weird transformations that you have to get exactly right. You could also make something like blockexplorer.com. (Java isn't bad for dynamic websites, or you could use Swing or whatever.)
If you connect to Bitcoin mainnet, please test your code on your own node until it's more-or-less working. People will be annoyed if you're *constantly* connecting+disconnecting and acting strangely.

"Steal" implies that someone would get the destroyed coins, which is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about lessening the impact of the almost-certain widespread theft of coins in case ECDSA is broken.
There are two choices if ECDSA is predicted to be broken:
* Allow the vulnerable coins to be stolen. The original owner loses the money, and Bitcoin as a whole is severely harmed.
* Destroy the coins. The original owner loses the money, and Bitcoin is not massively harmed. In *extremely rare cases*, people could lose money slightly earlier than otherwise.
As far as I see things, the second choice is clearly superior.

The incentives for miners not to steal BTC on Bitcoin are:
* For certain methods of theft, such as invalid transactions or too-high subsidy, their attempts will immediately be rejected by the economy because much of the economy relies on full nodes, and full nodes will reject such blocks absolutely. It'd be like the miners quitting Bitcoin to start mining some altcoin.
* For the limited and more difficult set of attacks where miners would not be immediately stopped (eg. double-spending or massive history rewrites), the full-node-backed economy would hardfork to a new PoW in case of attack.
On miner-secured sidechains, there can be no true full nodes, so the above incentives don't apply.

Alice has 1 BTC, which she bought at a price of $2300. She's willing to accept *some* risk, but she can't accept the risk of the price falling below $1700. Therefore, she seeks to buy *insurance against the price falling*. That's what a (put) option is. An option is a type of derivative contract, and in the context of BTC it is probably the only type that you need to care about.
Bob is a speculator. He thinks that there is only a 1 in a million chance that the BTC price falls below $1700 in the next month, and he wants to make some money off of this belief.
Using the LedgerX centralized options exchange as a broker, Alice and Bob agree to the following: on a specific date/time one month from now, if the BTC price is below $1700, Bob will "buy" Alice's 1 BTC at $1700. (Actually, for simplicity he'll just pay her the USD-denominated difference in value rather than actually taking her BTC.) In return for having Bob accept this risk, Alice will pay a $15 fee to Bob up front (and probably some percentage fee to LedgerX). Alice is happy because she has less risk, and Bob is happy because he made $15 on what he believes to be a very low-risk deal.
The above is a *put option*. You can also buy a *call option* if you somehow stand to lose from the price *increasing*: it guarantees a price that you can *buy* BTC at.
I've long wished that more of a derivatives market existed in Bitcoin. It's not just an instrument for speculation: this sort of "price insurance" is extremely useful for ordinary people. For example, if you agree to sell someone something for 1 BTC, but you won't actually receive the BTC for several days, then you could theoretically buy a put option for that amount of BTC expiring several days from now to ensure that the BTC doesn't lose value in transit. A wallet could even be designed to auto-buy option contracts in such a way to near-completely insulate the user from BTC price-change risk, at some ongoing cost to rebuy contracts (with the cost increasing proportional to price volatility). 
I think that LedgerX is just going to be a standard derivatives broker: a trusted third-party which oversees derivative transactions between buyers and sellers. Like Bitcoin exchanges. Sort of like a loan, options inherently involve trust, so I don't think that you can do trustless derivatives in any reasonable way, though a centralized broker is not ideal. I don't know anything about LedgerX in particular.

But one big problem with this sort of thing is that due to the nature of Bitcoin, this "taint" tends to spread very widely. If a transaction has as input 1 tainted satoshi and 100 untainted BTC, the entire output must be labeled as tainted, since the Bitcoin network doesn't keep track of individual satoshi. When a transaction has several inputs, the input coins are truly and inseparably mixed, like gold being melted together. The result is that if the thief sends the money to many different people, in a pretty short time a large percentage of all bitcoins (much more than were actually stolen) will be tainted.
Also, (even if stolen coins could be effectively traced), if a thief sells stolen coins to Mary, and Mary uses those coins to buy something from Bob, and Bob gives them as a gift to Alice, ... and so on through dozens of people, it'd be unfair to take the money from whoever ends up having it.
And even if the thief is known to control some address, and money from that address is sent directly to an exchange, the exchange can't just immediately give that money to victims. It is possible, for example, that the thief is using an EWallet with a shared wallet, and this money was actually sent by someone else. Or the thief could have transferred the money by giving someone the private key, without a Bitcoin transaction (perhaps through several people in completely separate and different transactions as above). This sort of transaction is a strong piece of evidence that *police* can use, but an exchange can never take it upon *itself* to steal and redistribute its customers' money.

The problem with arbitrage is that you have to ask yourself: "Why hasn't someone already done it?" Are you the first one to notice this opportunity? Are you faster or smarter than other traders? Do you have other advantages which allow you to profit where others don't? Usually, the answer is no, and the differences in price exist due to barriers in money transmission (fees, etc.) which even the best arbitrage traders haven't been able to overcome.

If transactions are being taken up into blocks fast enough, then sure, fees should be as low as possible. But when transactions are occurring more quickly than they are being included in blocks (potentially due to an attack on the network), a fee market is appropriate. The current mode of operation is to basically assume that everyone has the same fee policies, which is not a good or free-market solution, and which has been a constant source of issues. It's better for fees to float according to supply and demand. 
This is tangential to the max block size issue. Scarcity will always exist. Nothing can handle an *infinite* transaction volume.

First of all, it's not a good idea to touch any of the scaling parameters until SegWit activates and its max-blocksize increase is observed, so experts haven't been talking seriously about post-SegWit stuff like one-off hardfork increases, flexcap, etc. for quite some time. There isn't currently much debate about how to scale Bitcoin among experts: it's 1) Activate SegWit; 2) See how it goes; 3) Based on how things look, pull additional things out of the massive toolchest of well-vetted scaling ideas as needed, probably with new technical debate. The holdup over the last year has all been political nonsense, not technical.
Secondly, this is a kludgy solution which a lot of experts hate. It'd make fee estimation a lot more difficult, for example, since you'd have to worry about both your fee/kB as well as the (largely unknowable) net UTXO count of miners' blocks. I view it as an acceptable temporary way of making larger blocksizes reasonably safe, but it certainly shouldn't be viewed as an ultimate solution. The ultimate solution to UTXO-set bloat is probably TXO commitments.
(Though as Luke pointed out, I was mistaken: his proposal actually doesn't allow more than 1MB of non-witness data, so my suggestion isn't necessary here.)

CLTV and CSV both have to do with transaction finality. Most transactions are always final, but it is possible through the use of a transactin's lockTime and sequence fields to make the transaction start out non-final and then become final later. A non-final transaction can't be mined -- doing so makes the entire block absolutely invalid. Also, non-final transactions won't be relayed or stored in any node's mempool. There's no such thing as a mempool-only transaction. The parties of a non-final transaction need to communicate these transactions in some way external to the Bitcoin network (until they become final), such as via the Bitcoin Payment Protocol.
CLTV, CSV, and BIP 68 basically provide new ways for people to mark transactions as non-final and program them to eventually become final. These changes have fairly easy-to-understand behavior, but the reasons why these changes would be *useful* are a bit complicated/esoteric. (Most people think of a Bitcoin transaction as being created by one person, but CLTV/CSV/BIP68 are mainly useful when several people, who might not trust each other, are working together to create a single transaction.) Anyway, they make possible a number of extremely useful new contract types.
These changes are all softforks, but once they are activated (probably after 6+ months of rollout), they will be hard rules of Bitcoin. It will be impossible for anyone to violate these rules. (Part of the rollout procedure is to temporarily make them merely non-standard, though.)
Note that it is not allowed for a transaction to ever become non-final after being final. If this was allowed, it would would make Bitcoin less secure/reliable for all Bitcoin users. An important consideration in the design of things like CLTV is that they can't under any circumstances cause a valid transaction to become invalid.

There's nothing theoretically preventing it, but probably an extra tool would be required. The task is complicated because each wallet tends to use a slightly different way of generating mnemonics, so a programmer couldn't write a single universal tool.
If you can find a wallet that will accept an HD wallet master key/seed directly, you could generate it by putting your diceware phrase through SHA-256 and giving the output to the wallet. IIRC Electrum allows this. Dunno about Mycelium.
Diceware has more words than most HD wallet wordlists, so you only need 10 words to get the same 128 bits of security. (Ie. you need 50 6-sided dice rolls.)

I'm not convinced that elasticity of the money supply is necessary, but I agree that something like you describe would be a good free-market way to achieve it if people wanted.


If you have 1 BTC but issue 1.1 BTC in certificates, then you're guaranteeing that you will eventually default. That's not how fractional reserve typically works. How fractional reserve typically works is that you have 1 BTC and issue a 1 BTC certificate, but then you *loan out* some of that BTC. This increases the M1 money supply because both the certificate-holder and the borrower are using the same BTC in the economy. Then if there is a huge bank run, there might be delays until loans are paid back, but *losses* should be small or nonexistent (according to the credit risk accepted by the bank).
One problem with BTC fractional reserve is that BTC-denominated loans have much higher default risk due to the risk of the BTC price quickly doubling. I think that it'll only be possible to generate safe passive BTC income once volatility goes *way* down or an active derivatives market develops.

The 50 BTC subsidy can't be spent, but people have subsequently sent bitcoins to 1A1zx... which *can* be spent.


That pattern didn't begin until weeks later, it might not even have been Satoshi who was mining so much, and Sergio's method is fuzzy (ie. it could show two people mining at the same time with similar hardware as being the same person). The fact that Wright claims to have 1M BTC in his trust is more evidence that he's *not* Satoshi. It would be extremely surprising if Satoshi actually had more than 200k-500k BTC.
I doubt Wright has block 1, but if he does, I will not consider it to be sufficient evidence. Satoshi was in contact with several people in private since his 2008 post announcing the Bitcoin idea (before the software release), and one of them could easily have been the one to mine block 1. Satoshi will have block 0, block 9, and his PGP private key. Anyone incapable of signing with at least one of these is very unlikely to be Satoshi.

This is completely false. If there's a transaction with two 100 satoshi inputs and two 100 satoshi outputs, there is absolutely no way to objectively say which satoshi went where. The system doesn't keep track of that.
Colored coin systems sometimes work by defining some arbitrary way of tracking bitcoins through the system. But there are an infinite number of possible coin-tracking algorithms with hugely different outcomes. A satoshi that is tainted using one coin-tracking algorithm can easily be untainted in another. The Bitcoin system itself only keeps track of integer amounts of satoshi. It doesn't know what an individual satoshi actually "is".
(A colored coin system can also work purely on inputs/outputs, ignoring the amounts.)

Doing nothing due to *indecision* is usually wrong. Doing nothing *as an intentional choice* can be correct.
I believe that the correct course of action is BIP 149, or something like it. However, for technical reasons, BIP 149 cannot be implemented until SegWit's BIP9 bit times out in a few months. So for now, it is correct to do nothing. After the time-out, BIP 149 should be rolled out in earnest.
Trying to force through the far riskier BIP 148 just because it's a little less technically complex and because it allows you to immediately express your (100% legitimate) frustration with miners is not prudent.

I think the long-term idea is that ~everyone will either operate or subscribe to a Lightning hub (similar to how email works), and then the only main-net Bitcoin transactions they'll send are refreshes of their payment channel between them and the hub every 3-6 months. All transactions beyond that would be done via the Lightning network, which should be almost free. Since you'd only send real Bitcoin transactions a few times per year, you can tolerate a somewhat higher fee. There will still be lots of transactions establishing hub&lt;-&gt;hub and user&lt;-&gt;hub channels, so transaction fees might be even higher in total.
(I haven't really looked into Lightning much in particular, but this is usually the idea behind this sort of thing. It's a very old idea.)

Bitcoin transactions can have many inputs. Electrum will select coins for you automatically. However, in that situation you probably can't send 1 BTC because you'll need to pay a fee, which will bring the required total input amount slightly above 1 BTC.
See: 
You shouldn't think in terms of address balances. The protocol doesn't work in balances internally. If you receive 0.3 BTC, then you have a "0.3 BTC coin" in your wallet, not so much an address with a balance of 0.3.

Yeah, I watched the convention, and it was very clear that Weld, and even Johnson to a much lesser extent, were considered to be "Republican-lite" to large portion of the delegates. Weld probably would've lost if Johnson hadn't absolutely pleaded with the delegates to let Johnson have him.
Personally, I totally respect the ideological purist position, and I think that agorism rather than politics will end up being the real solution to government in the end. But I just don't see the point of participating in politics and having a political party if you're not going to try your best to win, which necessarily includes diverging at least a little bit from ideological purity. The Johnson/Weld ticket of two experienced governors with great records (from the perspective of *both* old parties) is extremely valuable.
One weird thing about the scenario I described in which Johnson wins is that although the House of Representatives chooses the president from among the top 3, the Senate chooses the vice president separately from among the top 2 vice presidential candidates. So if Johnson wins, he'll probably get stuck with Trump's vice president.

Not quite. Bitcoin 0.1 supported Bitcoin addresses just like today, but it also had a "pay to IP address" feature. When you used this, you'd connect to the IP and get the sender's full public key, and then send to that. The reason for this wierd feature was:
* I think that Satoshi designed the pay-to-IP option first, but then he came up with Bitcoin addresses later as a way to pay to offline recipients. But he didn't want to remove his pay-to-IP code.
* With pay-to-IP, you could include some out-of-band notes that would appear in the recipient's wallet, such as an invoice number. Sort of a precursor to today's Bitcoin Payment Protocol. Maybe a few very-early merchants used this instead of having a unique address per transaction.
Pay-to-IP was removed around 0.5, I think.
Also (and more importantly), the built-in solo miner would always pay directly to a public key, so there's over a million unspent bitcoins in the form of 50-BTC subsidies directly to public keys. Probably most of these are lost -- people who tried Bitcoin for a little while in the early days, but then gave up on it.

Cool. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012, and if I vote in 2016, I will vote for him again.
I think that he might have a narrow path to actually winning this time, and he does seem serious about it. If he can win enough states to prevent any candidate from getting the majority of electoral votes, then it gets thrown to the House of Representatives, where they have to pick from the top three candidates. There, Hillary will have no chance of winning because the Republicans have a majority, so all of the Democrats should vote for Johnson, since he's far better than Trump from the perspective of the Democratic platform. Then only a handful of Republicans have to vote for Johnson instead of Trump, which seems entirely possible to me. (Though the voting is done in state voting blocks -- not sure how this changes things.)
So, for example, Gary Johnson has a decent chance of winning the election if he wins just the single state of California. Probably this is *extremely* difficult, but I think it's possible.

It's funny that some people are taking the 95% threshold as some sort of hard rule put in place by Satoshi himself. In fact, when Satoshi did softforks (of which he did many), he always did them using a simple time trigger -- essentially a 0% threshold. After Satoshi, a ~55% threshold was used for the P2SH softfork, and for later softforks the IsSuperMajority (ISM) system was for a long time used, requiring a 75% threshold for enforcement and 95% for activation. Only recently has ISM been replaced by BIP 9, which has both a 95% threshold and much less variance than ISM. I sort-of feel like the devs are engaged in an experiment to see just how high they can get the threshold without softforks actually failing, since a higher threshold results in a smoother softfork in many ways. However, only a majority of miners is required for a generally-smooth softfork, and no miner support whatsoever is required for a Satoshi-style softfork.
And as cointastical mentions, there's no need for a threshold change to come from the Core devs. If the process drags on too long, I'd expect miners to start discouraging non-SegWit blocks in various ways, and eventually they could start hard-rejecting them.
(Edit: Corrected some info about ISM.)

If you run your own Electrum server, there's no problem. Having each Bitcoin user run one full node (maybe in dedicated/specialized hardware) and then having all of their lightweight nodes rely on this full node may be a good way forward, but right now it's too much to expect of even fairly advanced users.
Without your own server, Electrum works by joining a centralized IRC channel, choosing a random user from there, and trying to connect to them as a server. This is massively centralized due to the centralized ownership of the IRC channel/network, and massively insecure due to the potential for sybil attacks (if the IRC channel is not moderated, which is the case now).
BitcoinJ meanwhile errs in the opposite direction (toward centralization): BitcoinJ only ever connects to nodes returned by certain centralized servers. If even one of the centralized servers is compromised, the attacker has a lot of Sybil potential, which is especially powerful against non-full nodes.
As long as some sort of centralization is required to prevent Sybil attacks, probably the centralized servers should work like Tor's directory authorities, where the authorities vote on a "networkStatus consensus", and the majority of authorities have to agree or else the client stops working. This allows the authorities to actively work against Sybil attacks without allowing a few compromised authorities from bringing down the whole system. (Though Tor has had some notable failures in the area of Sybil prevention, at least one of which allowed for a total failure of Tor's security and the identification of a hidden service...)

Your CPFP transaction may have insufficient fees. Keep in mind that CPFP transactions must pay for both themselves and the parent transaction(s) that they're trying to confirm.
The CPFP transaction may also have failed to propagate well. I don't have an instance of Electrum in front of me, but from memory, you can rebroadcast it like this:
In Electrum's transaction details for the original transaction, copy the full raw transaction. It'll look like a long string of hexadecimal characters (0-9a-f). Go to the console tab. Type `sendrawtransaction PUT_TRANSACTION_HERE`. So the command will look something like `sendrawtransaction 001af2...`. Repeat for the CPFP transaction. Then switch to a different Electrum server in the network dialog; repeat this procedure on a few different servers.

Theoretically, fees should stick to real values and float according to BTC price. So if we assume that the real value of USD is perfectly stable, a normal feerate of $0.10/kB should not become $0.20/kB due to a BTC price increase from $1000-&gt;$2000. But currently and historically, this doesn't actually happen for some reason -- fees tend to stick to certain BTC values, and only slowly and partially correct for changing prices. Maybe a lot of wallets are still using fixed fees, which throws the whole thing off.
Fees are rather high. Undoubtedly, lower fees would be helpful in many ways, and could allow for Bitcoin's usage in more areas. However, Bitcoin's security and decentralization must be the first priority: there's no point in having low fees on an insecure and centralized cryptocurrency, since you'd always get out-competed by traditional centralized services like PayPal.
If fees bother you, there are solutions that are possible now, without waiting for consensus changes like SegWit or some insane hardfork. I *really* wish that someone would create a quick-and-dirty semi-centralized solution. I've posted about several:
* [Federated sidechains](
* [Blinded bearer certificates](
* [Ripple-style systems]( (you could do a lot better than this proposal -- I was trying to design something that's as simple as possible)
* [Microtransactions via altcoin auto-conversion](
If an "emergency solution" is necessary due to high fees, it's these semi-centralized layers that you should look to, *not* reckless changes to the base system that are extremely difficult to execute anyway. You can do these semi-centralized things without getting anyone else's agreement, and without risking Bitcoin as a whole.

Electrum's solution has problems with decentralization, security, and privacy. Maybe something in that general vein could be added to Core, though.
Once micropayment channel technology is working well, maybe you could pay nodes an extremely small fee to do rescan lookups for you. And then if you want to receive these extra payments, you can run a full node with an address index (or something similar, but with better privacy). One problem that comes to mind is how to check that the node you're paying isn't just accepting the payment and reporting, "no transactions found".

Agree, probably a good idea, though not strictly necessary.


Agree, though it's not that important. It certainly wouldn't be OK to argue, "Because some minority who is intentionally choosing a minority fork might be subject to double-spend attacks, we should preemptively attack them to deny them service."


Disagree. It's very likely that a majority of users would more-or-less do it, but it's not certain, and Bitcoin would probably also fracture, which calls into question what it means to "change Bitcoin's consensus rules".


Agree, the ideal would be absolute individual sovereignty. This isn't actually completely possible in Bitcoin for economic reasons, but we can strive for it.


Listening to the experts is always a good idea, but that shouldn't be interpreted as being *ruled by* experts. And certainly mob rule is bad. Agree.


Agree generally, though it's possible that emergency hardforks could be necessary.


Unclear question. Bottom-up changes are OK, but when I hear "grass roots political campaign" I think about advertising etc. pushed *by someone* with the goal of tricking ordinary people into doing something; if *that* sort of politicking worked, then that'd probably be a failure of Bitcoin -- some entity gaining control over Bitcoin through politics. So I said disagree.


It is important to be able to do hardforks. Bitcoin is utterly insecure if hardforks are impossible, since Bitcoin must be able to change the PoW in case of miner attack. And hardforks are often OK in other cases. But they're not important *because* we want to "show that the network is flexible and innovative", and almost all hardfork changes can in fact be done as softforks if necessary, so I said disagree.


Strongly disagree, that's politics. Bitcoin is meant to be outside of politics and other human failings as much as possible.


We should adjust and improve the consensus rules *in order to make a more perfect system*, but not especially with the goal of helping businesses or attracting capital. Disagree.


This is probably the main factor, though there are others. Agree.


Strongly disagree, Bitcoin is not ruled by miners.


This is one important consideration, though probably not the main one. Disagree.


Strongly disagree, in a contentious hardfork the two currencies will probably exist indefinitely, though one will probably significantly eclipse the other after a while.


Disagree, SegWit increases the max block size to ~2MB and has widespread agreement.


It's useful for there to be one reference implementation, though it shouldn't really be "official", and it's essential that it be theoretically possible for some other implementation to *overthrow* this implementation. Agree.


Agree, all organizations inevitably become corrupt. It needs to be possible for the reference implementation to be overthrown.


Strongly disagree.


Not sure about this. It makes sense, but for some reason this seems to not be what Bitcoin has observed. Disagree.


Agree. Generally this is a good idea, though you could make a from-scratch version if you were *unbelievably* careful. I'm not convinced that the current attempts have been anywhere near careful enough.


Disagree. Bitcoin is about individual sovereignty, nobody should be having decisions made for them. But that doesn't mean that you should just ignore everything that experts are saying, either. On any given issue, the experts are *probably* right, even if you initially disagree with them.


Agree. This is survivable, but far from ideal.


Strongly disagree, miners are the last ones who should be making such a decision.


Disagree. Maybe this could work if done very carefully, but not just as an entry in a configuration file or whatever.


Disagree, I'm skeptical that exponential increases in power will continue forever in CPU speed etc. Though maybe a *slow* exponential could be acceptable.


Agree, this sounds fine if the numbers are right.


Strongly disagree, that's just another way of letting miners decide.


Agree, possibly workable if there are also some hard limits to prevent excessive centralization pressure.


Agree, that's what SegWit does.


Strongly disagree. Maybe you could remove the *global* limit (as I mentioned above), but probably some limit will always be needed.


Disagree. It's survivable, but far from ideal.


Agree. A normal hardfork would probably be better in some ways, but if extblocks are a lot easier, then they're also fine. (Note however that I absolutely condemn the specific extblocks proposal pushed by Bitmain's puppets.)


Strongly agree, this is SegWit.

Especially with pruning, something like that is necessary IMO. Maybe there should be a standard protocol for getting "rescan data" from third-parties. It's probably possible to rescan via the network using bloom filtered getblock requests, though maybe it'd be really slow.

Meeting [my consensus criteria]( would be sufficient IMO.
I talk about this more [here](


For example, the following things would be removed:
* Promoting XT.
* Promoting the usage of the BIP 101 patch to Core.
* Promoting other software intentionally programmed to diverge from Bitcoin without consensus.
These things would not be removed:
* Links to source code implementing a hardfork, but without the suggestion that people run this code right away.
* Promoting/discussing the *idea* of a specific hardfork. For example, "BIP 101 is the best way forward for Bitcoin because ...".
Moderation is always subjective (though hopefully consistent), so in many cases we will allow things that one could *conceivably* consider to be promotion of XT etc., but which are more about something else (such as this article).

There are three possible bottlenecks to syncing: disk speed, Internet bandwidth, and CPU speed. You can check which one it is by measuring your CPU usage and network usage. If it doesn't look like you're maxing out either of those, but you have several network peers, then it's probably your disk. This is the most common cause of extreme slowness, since Bitcoin requires a ton of random disk access during syncing. You might try disabling your disk's APM feature (which makes it quieter and less power-consuming, though with a big performance hit) using `hdparm`.
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:49:09
That's one way of looking at it... But although I don't know exactly how RSK does it, generally in a federated sidechain you'd send a Bitcoin transaction with an output script like `m &lt;notary pubkeys&gt; n CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY &lt;serialized sidechain outputs&gt;`. And then on the sidechain you'd use an input which spends the output serialized within the Bitcoin output. So it's not as if the notaries are issuing tokens directly; the system is just set up to rely on them. It's only when withdrawing from the sidechain that the notaries have to take direct action. Even then, which transactions they sign is exactly dictated by the rules of the sidechain, so everyone will know if they break the rules. That's why these entities tend to be called notaries or functionaries rather than banks.
@_date: 2016-10-12 06:57:41
That's an interesting thought. It's imaginable that banks would totally lose faith in the USD and aggressively seek alternatives, including BTC, so when the Fed injects USD into banks, much of it ends up in Bitcoin. I wonder if there's any similar precedent to this in other currencies. Though probably before things get this bad, governments would implement severe capital controls, making it impossible for legal banks to do it.

As far as anyone in the public knows, there's no new research that has even slightly weakened ECC. People are just a little more worried than usual that the NSA found something and is keeping it secret. (Since the NSA is the world's biggest employer of cryptographers, this is something that everyone always worries about.) Probably no action is required in the Bitcoin space until we get something more solid, especially since Bitcoin doesn't use a NIST/NSA curve -- ECC in general would have to be broken for Bitcoin to be affected.
Any new crypto can be added to Bitcoin as a softfork in a totally backward-compatible way. It's considered unlikely for Bitcoin's secp256k1 to be broken without all of ECC being broken, so perhaps the next new crypto to be added will be some sort of Lamport Signature scheme, which is also very strong against quantum computers (and in fact very unlikely to be weak to *any* attack).
One annoying thing is that secp256k1 has only 128-bit security, while most of Bitcoin's crypto has 256-bit security. (Satoshi might not have been aware of this.) Maybe a larger curve should be added. Though this'd significantly increase the load on the network, and maybe attacks successful against 256-bit ECC but not ~512-bit ECC are unlikely enough to make it not worthwhile.

The solution to point-of-sale will be instant off-chain systems like Lightning. Even if you paid the highest-priority fee, at any given point in time, the probability that **no** transactions will be confirmed in the next hour is about 0.25% (ie. it happens more than once per week on average) due to the random nature of Bitcoin mining. But at point-of-sale, even *one* minute is pushing it.
For now, it'd probably be OK to accept small-value transactions at 0 confirmations and then deal with any double-spending as you would credit card fraud. A double-spent transaction is basically absolute proof of fraud, which you could probably use legally. But for high-value transactions, you just have to wait, since there is no good off-chain system usable yet.

In an ideal crypto-anarchist world, a lot of stupid laws would become much more difficult to enforce. This includes things like income tax, many types of regulations, many types of victimless crimes, intellectual property laws, anti-free-speech laws, etc. Also, if Bitcoin was the dominant currency, it would prevent governments from printing money, which is basically a very insidious wealth tax. Preventing these horrible forms of government control would be an influence in the direction of anarcho-capitalism, but even quite leftist governments could still exist.
For example, it is impossible to escape property tax, since everyone (currently) has a physical body which must exist somewhere, so everyone will either be paying property tax directly, or indirectly via increased rent prices. So even if a government is unable to effectively collect income tax and (to some degree) sales tax, and unable to print money, they could collect enough property tax to do whatever programs they want, including UBI. All tax is immoral, but funding government entirely through a property tax would be far better than the current tax system, especially due to increased transparency. (If you considered only economic issues, it might be somewhat better to have a sales tax in addition to or in place of a property tax, but I think that a sales tax increases the size/scope of government more than a property tax, and crypto-anarchy would make enforcing this difficult in many cases.)
Bitcoin is just a small and incomplete piece of the crypto-anarchist puzzle, though. Bitcoin can theoretically be anonymous, but it's very difficult to achieve today. Bitcoin's decentralization is also not ideal due to substantial miner centralization and a widespread reliance on lightweight nodes and centralized APIs by Bitcoin users. Anonymous content distribution is another important component of crypto-anarchy, but Tor was successfully deanonymized in one case recently, and the tech in I2P and Freenet is IMO probably even less secure. There's a lot of work to be done on anonymity, and actually not all that much interest from computer scientists.
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:48:33
That reasoning only really works if you can treat miners as a single bloc. Currently you more-or-less can, so I mostly agree with your conclusion, but if mining was actually decentralized in any meaningful way, then you'd probably get the reverse problem: some small miner would always be able to undercut the pricing enforced by other miners, and it would be a "race to the bottom".

There have been tons of ideas for that, but usually they don't work. For example, Litecoin was originally created with the intention of being both GPU- and ASIC-resistant. But GPU miners were created very quickly, and ASICs came a few years later. Same for X11. You can design a PoW that *seems difficult* to design an ASIC for, but it's a lot more difficult to design a PoW that *cannot* have efficient ASICs. Perhaps [cuckoo]( fits the bill, but this is unproven.
You also have to ask whether it's completely desirable for a PoW to be ASIC-resistant. Botnets would probably become a major mining force, for example. I like the idea of a [3-way hybrid PoW]( to get the benefits of all worlds.

In Bitcoin, coins are not of fixed sizes. When you receive a transaction for 100 BTC, you've received a single 100 BTC coin. You can break this apart into smaller coins or combine it with other coins to make a larger coin.
If you have one 50 BTC coin in your wallet and you send 10 BTC, then your transaction will be small in data size and large in value, which increases priority. If you have 50 BTC in your wallet composed of hundreds of small coins, then sending 10 BTC will usually be large in data size and low in value, which decreases priority.

blockparser is amazingly memory-ineficient. If possible, it'd probably cheaper and easier in the long-run to use something else. For example, depending on what you want to do, you might be able to use the addrindex patch for Bitcoin Core, which allows you to look up all of the transactions for any address. You can also use Bitcoin Core to go through and get all of the blocks and transactions in easy-to-handle JSON format. JSON-RPC adds some overhead compared to parsing the raw block files, though I imagine that it might still be faster than something that needs 8+ GB of memory to function.

* Fees will be so low the network will pay *you* to transact.
* Due to a lack of malleability, transactions may sometimes become stuck in small-diameter Ethernet cables. You should be able to shake them loose with a little manual effort.
* To reflect the massive changes that **S**egWit brings, the BTC symbol will be changed to **$**. As an additional bonus, this symbol happens to already exist in many fonts!
But seriously, wallets will need to be upgraded. Your transactions will only be discounted if you create SegWit transactions. Transactions created by non-SegWit-supporting wallets will not be discounted. Though because *other* people will be using size-discounted SegWit transactions, more room will exist for your transactions.
BTC sent to addresses created before you upgrade your wallet will be in non-SegWit outputs, and the signatures you use to spend these will not be discounted. So for maximum efficiency, you should use new addresses (though you shouldn't be reusing addresses anyway...).

Edit: It was [proven to be fraudulent]( It's just the signature of the transaction, which is obviously publicly available on the block chain. Not some "Sartre" message.
That's a very good point, especially since he apparently didn't sign it with the standard Bitcoin signing protocol invented years after Satoshi disappeared. Also, what exactly is the message he signed? I can't find it, and the signature can't be verified without the message.
If he can freely sign with 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S, then that would be some decent evidence that he's Satoshi. But after the [overwhelming evidence]( that Wright's previous attempts to claim to be Satoshi were fake as well as [reports that he's pulling some sort of scam]( I consider it *very* unlikely that he's actually Satoshi or that he actually can freely sign with this address. If the whole signature thing is not fake, then I'd assume (absent additional evidence) that this signature was pulled from satoshin which is known to have been compromised.

With all optimizations, a full node can get by by just downloading all transactions that appear in blocks. But the blocks need to be downloaded from somewhere, and lightweight nodes rely on full nodes for various services. So the network should have many nodes with bandwidth (especially upload bandwidth) far above the absolute minimum. I'm especially worried that the bandwidth situation will get tighter and tighter as time goes on, if actual bandwidth increases are slower than max block size increases.
You also have to think about data caps. 60 MB blocks would exceed the 250 GB monthly limit on AT&amp;T U-Verse's fastest plan, for example. Data caps are even worse in some situations, such as on cell networks (which many people use even for home Internet).
Also, if Bitcoin is *constantly* using 50% of your bandwidth, then that's probably going to annoy most people enough to make them stop running it, even if they're technically capable of running it.


My home upload speed is about 1 Mbit/s.


I made it clear that my view is not universally accepted.
If the max block size was removed, we would not have 1 GB blocks overnight. But I believe that the incentives are such that the actual block size would tend to increase pretty quickly. In particular, it is nearly costless *for miners* to include transactions in their blocks, so they'll accept transactions even if they have fees that are essentially dust. But each transaction needs to be downloaded by all full nodes and stored for at least a while, which is on aggregate extremely expensive. Furthermore, people sending transactions are incentivized only to keep their fees as low as possible. So the incentives are all wrong for keeping blocks small without a hard max block size.
Blocks currently aren't getting full because transactions are too expensive. If they were nearly free (as would be expected if supply=block space became infinite), there'd be a lot more microtransactions. There's some limit to this, but it's probably pretty high.


That exact thing is in fact pretty famous for actually happening...  
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:36:44
Those fraud proofs only end up providing SPV-level security, so a majority of miners will always be able to hardfork a sidechain into whatever rules they want. (This isn't the case in Bitcoin, where miners have no influence over hardforks.) It might be possible to create a way to exactly specify all of the hard rules of a sidechain, and then allow fraud proofs against those hard rules, but this might be unreasonably expensive for Bitcoin full nodes to have to handle. And no one's working on this AFAIK.
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:00:55
Your hardware/software testing is very good. I was actually thinking several months ago of doing similar testing before suggesting some sort of max block size increase myself, but I'm glad you did it first, since your testing is probably way better than mine would have been.


This is the part that I'm not so sure about. What studies have there been to support that number? I saw "Nielsen's Law", but that's apparently just one guy's personal experience, and not based any any sort of real data.
I'm also interested in what percentage of the US/world population can right now comfortably deal with 20 MB blocks, and also whether bandwidth growth is reasonably equal among different countries. If the US is growing much faster than most countries, then that's a problem.
I'm not worried about a handful of dial-up users getting left behind, but I would like to be pretty sure that the number of people who can run full nodes will tend to increase over time, not decrease.


Sure, though maybe the version increase should itself be delayed for quite some time. Otherwise that "upgrade required!" warning might make a lot of people think, "Today's the day when I have to choose between Bitcoin and Gavincoin, what do I do!?"
P2SH worked out very well in the end, but I'm sure you remember how messy and political that whole thing was. The hard fork is going to be a lot worse, since miners, businesses, and regular users will all need to upgrade. To minimize drama, the upgrade process should be hidden from ordinary users as much as possible. Only people doing something pretty unusual should have to take special action. That's why I suggest a really far-in-the-future flag day.
Another thing that annoyed me about the P2SH rollout was that it somehow became viewed as a binding vote that only miners got to participate in, which is totally contrary to Bitcoin's whole idea of "be your own bank" and "the network rules are enforced no matter what". I'm hoping that this sort of thinking can be mostly avoided this time around.
Thanks a lot for all of your work in this area! It's a bit difficult to productively discuss this because there's no objectively correct answer and pretty much everyone has a different idea about how best to proceed, but discussion needs to happen if we're ever going to reach some sort of consensus.

Ideally from my point of view, all taxation would be made impossible, but Bitcoin alone can't do that, unfortunately. If Bitcoin totally took over the world, it might make *individual income tax* and a small percentage of sales tax difficult to enforce, but you'd have to have crypto-anarchist stuff totally permeate society to hide a majority of sales/income, and no amount of crypto is going to hide stuff like property ownership, major natural-resource extraction efforts (which are often taxed), major construction, centralized electrical distribution (which will always be cheaper than self-sufficiency), etc. Several US states have no income tax and get along just fine.
P.S. I've been thinking about writing an article about how leftists should try to compromise by eliminating income tax, but replacing it with sales and/or property tax which would *increase* the total tax. I think that a lot of leftists don't realize that one of the main reasons conservatives and libertarians don't like income tax is because it's invasive and very harmful economically compared to other types of tax, and a lot of people would (grudgingly) accept a 5% increase or whatever to the total tax they pay if it meant removing the *income* tax. (Not sure where I would usefully post this article, though.)

Yeah, getting the timing right will be difficult. On the one hand, you want to give people as much time as possible to move their bitcoins, but on the other hand it'd be very harmful if you're late by too much.
One helpful thing is that quantum computers will start out extremely slow and extremely expensive. So if the deadline is a few months too late, it's likely that only a small fraction of QC-breakable bitcoins could be stolen in that time, and maybe none of the parties with access to such a powerful quantum computer would be hidden enough to actually steal BTC and get away with it.
One interesting suggestion I heard was that you could do the UTXO deletions gradually over a year-long interval (or whatever), with the highest-value UTXOs getting deleted before the lower-value ones. That way, the UTXOs with the highest reward-to-cost ratio for attackers and the highest risk to Bitcoin would be deleted right away, buying extra time for the vast majority of people who have far-lower-value UTXOs.
(BTW, although you often hear about minuscule quantum computers being built in labs, most experts think that a quantum computer large enough to attack Bitcoin keys won't exist for at least 10-20 years.)

I haven't thought about it too deeply, but the graph-instead-of-chain designs make me nervous. My biggest concern is that with a chain, if miners become evil and rewrite the last 6 blocks or something, *everyone* is going to notice and be affected, and a PoW change or other appropriate response will be fairly easy. But with a graph, maybe an attacker could just nibble at the edges in such a way that 99.99% of users are able to think "well, it's not really my problem". In fact, it may not even be easily provable that an attack happened at all. Also, it seems more difficult for a graph to convincingly provide stability/convergence/security in all circumstances. Even if it works in tests, how do we know that no attack is possible, or that it won't just fall apart on its own in just the wrong conditions? It seems too haphazard/ad-hoc. A Bitcoin-style chain on the other hand has certain fairly obvious security and convergence guarantees.
Maybe it could be made to work, but I'd like to see some very serious analysis.

Atomic swaps / cross-chain trading (two very similar concepts) can be used between any two cryptocurrencies with sufficient smart contract support, eg.

It's pretty unlikely that a hardfork will be added so quickly. The HK agreement (which involved ~3 Core devs who very explicitly were representing only themselves, not all Core devs) calls for a hardfork to be *presented to the community* in July, by those devs who participated in the agreement. This will probably take the form of a pull request, which will likely receive months of debate before being merged (if it gets consensus). And the hardfork won't be anything too major -- maybe an increase of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to 2 MB in accordance with BlueMatt's earlier proposal, which also involved decreasing the SegWit discount to 50% to keep the bandwidth cost about the same relative to SegWit with 75% discount and MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=1MB.
And there's no reason to delay SegWit until 2017. Miners can and should adopt 0.12.2 as soon as it becomes available, which will probably be sometime in July, I suppose. Also, although BIP 9 calls for a 95% threshold, this can't actually be enforced -- a simple majority of mining power is always capable of activating a softfork. So there's no big risk of a minority of mining power holding things up for many months.
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:35:24
BIP 9 specifies a 95% threshold, but only 50% is actually necessary for a softfork. If SegWit gets 60%, say, then the lagging miners can be orphaned out.
If less than 50% can be gotten, then there would be two options:
* It's possible to force through a softfork in a process very similar to a hardfork. Miners would have to adopt the new rules or have their blocks rejected by the economy.
* If the behavior of miners is viewed as unacceptable, the PoW can be changed.
There'd have to be a debate at the time about which option is correct. (When miners were stalling P2SH adoption, I advocated strongly for forcing it through. Though miners ended up coming around before it was necessary.)
I tend to think that even failing to get 95% is a bit unlikely, though, and failing to get 50% is particularly unlikely.

In reality, all of our values are being constantly tested in wars that *we can lose, utterly*. The American political status quo could continue on its evil neocon/neoliberal path for a long time, and support for it could even surge; there are ways in which hardcore liberalism and/or socialism could arise and even be made stable; a 1984-style endless dystopia is very possible with modern technology, especially as apathy grows; and *Bitcoin could be destroyed by external forces*. You have to be prepared to *fight* if you want to win, not just sit back and talk about how the universe is arranged such that the other side will fall apart on its own.
(This isn't a new thing; I was complaining about it even [in 2011]( But it's actually starting to *matter* now for Bitcoin.)

There's something to be said for that, but on the other hand if you imagine the situation where a government wants to attack Bitcoin, I feel like it'd be easier for them to get tons of GPUs than to get more ASICs (which are limited in supply) than everyone else.
Some Bitcoin experts think that the memory-bound [cuckoo]( PoW might be ASIC-resistant.


I don't think that it can work on its own, but I think that it can positively supplement a real PoW algorithm. When mixed with a PoW, the convergence problem of PoS might be fixable.

"Segwit2x" is on/before Aug 1 doing exactly what the Core devs want, activating SegWit via the original BIP141 deployment mechanism. Out-of-band, some people have an agreement to try a hardfork 3 months later, but that isn't (and can't be) tied in with the Aug 1 thing at a technical level.

In my previous 100+100-&gt;100+100 transaction example, let's say that the first input was colored. A colored coin system would have an arbitrary rule that says something like "If the input to a transaction has X colored satoshi, then X colored satoshi become colored starting with the first output". Under such a system, all of the satoshi in the first output would become colored. But the rule could also be, "X colored satoshi become colored starting with the last output", resulting in all satoshi in the second output becoming colored. Or "Each output of the transaction gets an equal number of colored satoshi, with any remainder being assigned starting from the first output," resulting in 50 satoshi in the first output and 50 satoshi in the second output becoming colored. Each of these define a valid and usable rule for keeping track of individual satoshi, and a colored coin system could use any of these rules. But Bitcoin itself doesn't have a way of tracing a satoshi. Any attempt to do so is an imaginary (but exact and usable) rule applied to Bitcoin transactions.
Imagine that you want to trace a particular satoshi. You do so by coloring it with a unique color and seeing which satoshi ends up with the same color. But as I explained above, there is no unique, universal, or objectively-right way of propagating color through the system. Different colored coin systems would say that different satoshi end up colored in the end. So there's no unique, objective way to trace individual satoshi.

It's a softfork, so there wouldn't be any actual fork unless some part of the Bitcoin economy explicitly refused to accept the new rules. People who did nothing would automatically accept the new rules.


For many, another one of Bitcoin's core appeals is that it's expected to eventually become deflationary due to the fixed monetary inflation schedule and the effect of lost coins. If periodic weakening of the crypto allows lost coins to be recovered, then *unpredictable* periods of what is essentially monetary inflation will occur.
There's no majority rule in Bitcoin. A hardfork requires a large supermajority of the economy (ie. "consensus"). A softfork requires only the majority of mining power, though a large supermajority of the economy can undo a softfork. It *is* a big problem that a majority of miners can *today* start blacklisting coins which belong to "criminals" or whatever, but to a large extent the real fix for this is the widespread usage of low-cost anonymity techniques such as CoinSwap which would make it extremely difficult to identify which coins belong to which person.


It'd be a weighting of harm vs benefit. It'd depend in large part on how quickly the attacker could break keys.

Litecoin is basically the same as Bitcoin technically, so it'd probably be not too different from the perspective of a government that was planning on investing 100+ times the current market cap into the currency. However, if they were looking to appear to be adopting a neutral currency, they might prefer Bitcoin because it already has a substantial community/ownership. And if they wanted a lot of control over the currency they'd probably be inclined to create a brand new Bitcoin clone.
Non-clone altcoins are ~always technically worse than Bitcoin overall. ETH and Monero have even worse scaling properties than Bitcoin, for example. (Less apparent now because they're hardly used for real transactions and they don't have 7+ years of historical blocks.) Ripple and most pure-PoS altcoins are substantially centralized, though governments might value decentralization less than they should.
In reality, if a government started pumping billions of dollars over a short period of time into *any* cryptocurrency which worked anything like Bitcoin does at the moment, I'd expect that either:
* The currency would stop working effectively due to congestion, attacks, or botched hardforks attempting to fix issues.
* The government would twist the cryptocurrency into something with substantial centralization. Maybe something that works like Liquid, or a network in which there are only a few dozen full nodes. (BTW, I don't oppose Liquid's existence -- it's a good *optional* addition to the Bitcoin ecosystem.)
I believe that someday the Bitcoin currency can power 100% of the world's transactions in a decentralized way, but a lot of new technology will be necessary first.

No, that'd make it impossible to actually use versionbits without a hardfork. If Bitcoin Core sees a non-standard bit set, it's assumed that they're signalling support for an unknown softfork (maybe one that was added in a future version).

Currently it grows by up to 1MB \* 6 blocks/hour \* 24 hours/day \* 365 days/year = 53GB/year. If SegWit is activated (which could happen soon), then the max block size will be increased to a theoretical maximum of 4MB, but with typical maximums around 2.3MB. So that'll be 121GB-210GB per year.
You can run Bitcoin Core with the `prune=550` option in order to cut this down to only a few GB. Pruned nodes are still full nodes, and do not have reduced security, but they are slightly less helpful to the network. Sometime in the future it'll hopefully be possible to usefully store just a fixed x GB of the historical block chain and distribute the storage sort of like a BitTorrent swarm, but that's not possible now.

BIP91 is largely supported by the Core devs. It received some good responses when it was [proposed on the mailing list in May]( and since then I've heard some support and hardly any objection to it.
Some people who want a hardfork have decided to *use* BIP91, but **BIP91 does not include a hardfork**.  If SegWit activates via BIP91, then we have SegWit free-and-clear, not contingent on any future hardfork or anything. If people try a hardfork later, then that'll be a separate thing not connected to BIP91 in any technical way.

Edit: To be absolutely clear: I am not proposing (and would never propose) a policy that would have the goal of depriving anyone of his bitcoins. Satoshi's bitcoins (which number far below 1M, I think) rightfully belong to him, and he can do whatever he wants with them. Even if I wanted to destroy Satoshi's bitcoins in particular, *it's not possible to identify which bitcoins are Satoshi's*. I am talking about destroying presumably-lost coins that are *going to be stolen*, ideally just moments before the theft would occur. 
This issue has been discussed for several years. I think that the very-rough consensus is that old coins should be destroyed before they are stolen to prevent disastrous monetary inflation. People joined Bitcoin with the understanding that coins would be permanently lost at some low rate, leading to long-term monetary deflation. Allowing lost coins to be recovered violates this assumption, and is a *systemic* security issue.
So if we somehow learn that people will be able to start breaking ECDSA-protected addresses in 5 years (for example), two softforks should be rolled out now:
* One softfork, which would activate ASAP, would assign an OP_NOP to OP_LAMPORT (or whatever QC-resistant crypto will be used). Everyone would be urged to send all of their bitcoins to new OP_LAMPORT-protected addresses.
* One softfork set to trigger in 5 years would convert OP_CHECKSIG to OP_RETURN, destroying all coins protected by OP_CHECKSIG. People would have until then to move their BTC to secure addresses. Anyone who fails to do so would almost certainly have lost their money due to the ECDSA failure anyway -- the number of people who lose *additional* BTC would be very low. (There might be a whitelist of UTXOs protected by one-time-use addresses, which would remain secure for a long time.)

Their attack would probably make that worthwhile. They would be able to create infinite bitcoins for a window of perhaps a day or two before everyone stops accepting Bitcoin.
This would look especially attractive on price downswings when mining hardware isn't looking especially valuable anyway.

You could probably do a hardfork with the same capacity *and* safety as SegWit if you added various extra limits such as a limit on the max number of net UTXOs per block. But why would you? SegWit fixes this in a much more elegant way, is a softfork, fixes malleability, allows nodes to only download non-witness data for some or all blocks (at reduced security), introduces script versioning, fixes exponential signature verification time, etc. And it's not as though someone sat down and thought, "Hmm, how can I jam a whole bunch of good things together into one big mess?" SegWit is an elegant concept which *naturally* hits many birds with one stone.
There's never been much opposition to 2MB blocks in terms of space/bandwidth. When people say "decentralists like theymos don't think that Bitcoin can support 2MB, which is totally ridiculous, look how little bandwidth and disk space 2MB every 10 minutes requires!", they are making a blatant strawman argument. [Here's a post from me in 2015 about how I thought 10MB would be OK]( though that was before all of the aspects of the issue were known, so I was almost entirely considering bandwidth there. But 10MB blocks *would* IMO be fine if several technical improvements were made in order to fix UTXO-set growth, initial sync time, rescans with pruning, and archival-node storage. (Fixed respectively by TXO commitments, syncing backward, a private-information-retrieval protocol for wallet scans, and historical block sharding.)
I oppose a naïve 2MB hardfork because:
* SegWit is better in every way.
* Scheduling additional scaling in addition to SegWit is stupid when we haven't even observed the effects of SegWit's max block size increase yet.
* Without several additional hard limits, a naïve hardfork would allow the UTXO set to grow at an unsafe speed, and would allow blocks with exponential verification times.
* All attempts so far have tried to do hardforks in very short timeframes and without consensus, which is insane unless Bitcoin is already near-fatally ill.

Great points. That's my view of what Bitcoin should aim for. Let other cryptocurrencies do risky things and maybe get ahead for a while. If Bitcoin's price crashes due to it, but Bitcoin keeps functioning, then so what? Bitcoin is a project to create the perfect money, not a money-making scheme. While other cryptocurrencies rise and fall, Bitcoin will be the currency that stays functional and decentralized decades into the future. And that itself has way more value than pretty much any hypothetical feature enhancements, which can in many cases be eventually softforked into Bitcoin after extensive thought and testing anyway.
(Though I'm extremely skeptical about the real-world value of ETH's technical differences compared to Bitcoin. IMO Monero is the best example of a cryptocurrency that is definitely better than Bitcoin in one area, if not overall.)

Nope, that's the gambler's fallacy. At any given instant, the expected time until the next block is always 10 minutes, regardless of what's happened in the past. (Ignoring the fact that the network hashrate rises/falls somewhat over time.) It's a Poisson process.

It's never relevant. There is no democracy among full nodes. If there are 100k nodes which have no actual *economic backing/purpose*, then those nodes are meaningless. What matters is what exchanges, merchants, and individual users do with their spending/buying power. (That's why I say "the full-node economy", not just "the full nodes".)


Was he proposing it seriously? My post is meant to put forward an idea that has several obvious flaws, to show why Bitcoin is not and should not be ruled by miners.
Though nobody should be ostracized just for throwing out ideas, of course. While the base Bitcoin layer obviously must remain 100% decentralized, there are actually a lot of cool things you can do if you're willing to accept some amount of centralization. For example, Tor completely relies on centralized servers to function.

There is no single global mempool. Each node has different policies and receives different transactions.

It depends on the extent of their support, which I don't know. I think that a lot of people who say they support BIP 148 are just *saying* it, when in reality the only thing that matters is *whether they will, on the BIP148 flag day, hard-reject blocks invalid under the new rules*. I doubt that many BIP148-"supporting" organizations will actually stick their neck out like that unless it's looking pretty clear that BIP148 will succeed.
If in doubt, don't send transactions or trust received transactions around the time of the BIP148 activation time, and wait for further news. Coins that aren't being moved aren't at risk.

I don't keep stats over time. I've seen more SPV nodes than that at times, but I don't know exactly when or how many.
You can get this data by giving Bitcoin Core the `getpeerinfo` command. Then look in "subver" to see what software that peer is running. "Satoshi" (aka Bitcoin Core) is the most common type of full node, and "bitcoinj" is the most common type of SPV node. You won't get many SPV connections unless your node has been online and stable for (I think) at least a couple weeks, though.

They'd be incentivized to collude because colluding would allow them to create a bunch of bitcoins out of thin air, which would be immediately very profitable. Someone would figure out that this was happening and make noise, but probably not before the evil miners stole a bunch of fiat money and other valuable things from exchanges, etc. (This attack is far more powerful and less limited than double-spending.)
The miners (perhaps in cooperation with some important players in the ecosystem) could also get political and say, "Look at all of these studies that show that deflation is bad. For the good of Bitcoin, we're going to increase monetary inflation slightly." If very few people are using software that actively prevents this, then I can easily see many people being lazy and going along with this. The key to preventing this is to have a big portion of the economy (especially big merchants) using full nodes so that rule-breaking miners are unable to spend their invalid bitcoins anywhere that matters.

I see this sort of statement a lot, but I acknowledge that I'm just some guy on the Internet. I'm not a businessman or a politician. If I am totally forgotten in a couple years, that'd be fine with me.
I don't make any money whatsoever as a result of (which has no revenue) except *maybe* if somehow manages to affect the Bitcoin price. (Note however that I have never shorted BTC, and I very rarely do short-term speculative trades anymore, so the only way that I can make money in this way is if the price goes up.) I don't have any financial interest in any Bitcoin company except bitcointalk.org, and I am not employed by anyone but myself. I have never received money from Blockstream, BitPay, or MIT.
Probably nothing I can do would harm Coinbase or other huge companies *all* that much.
However, I'm not just going to do something wrong because it's popular or whatever. If Coinbase adopts XT, then they are (or, some might say, are merely on the road toward) leaving the Bitcoin network; moreover, they are doing something that is massively damaging to the Bitcoin ecosystem. So I'll still classify even Coinbase as an altcoin exchange if this becomes accurate because this is the right thing to do AFAICT. I don't care whether this has no effect on Coinbase or completely drives them out of business. I don't care whether this causes the Bitcoin price to rise or fall. I don't care whether this makes more or less popular. I don't care how this affects my reputation.

BitPay gives merchants the option of accepting 0-confirmation payments, which allows the payment to instantly clear as you saw. It's possible (though at least a bit of a hassle) for senders to reverse payments while they have 0 confirmations, though. If this happens, the merchant (not BitPay) eats the cost. Presumably, they'd use the same procedures they use for credit card fraud to handle this.

*Theoretically* it is possible, and should be secure. However:
* It is never recommended to use the same key for both signing and encryption. That's why PGP always has a main key and then one or more different subkeys signed by the main key. Bitcoin is not a general-purpose encryption/signing system like PGP, so it doesn't directly support this sort of arrangement.
* For some reason (maybe because signing was standardized a few years before encryption), there isn't much software for encryption, and it's not as well-tested. And a lot of the software out there is haphazard garbage, not even trying to follow the standards. For example, some stuff on github is blatantly insecure, and could allow an attacker to recover your private key. With ECC, there are a number of easy ways to totally screw yourself. For example, if your *random number generator* is faulty, then this can allow someone with just some of your signatures to recover your private key. (And don't trust that just because some piece of code on github is popular that it is actually secure.)
The bottom-line is: Just use gpg if you want to do general signing/encryption. Don't use amateur code found on github to shoehorn Bitcoin into doing gpg's job.

Anonymous people can't be targeted by governments/criminals. They are free to make the correct choices without fear of any personal consequences, and can't easily be silenced.
They do have the additional risk that they could be infiltrators from the start, or that their anonymity could be compromised and their pseudonyms hijacked, or that they could someday decide to do something evil and then not face many long-term consequences.

It's 2-of-2 multisig. You send someone a payment that requires their signature and your own signature to spend. Then they must deliver their end of the deal or else you'll refuse to release the money, and it'll be frozen forever ("turned to lead").
This concept is used right now on GreenAddress and some other sites. You need your signature and GreenAddress's signature to spend money, so they can't steal your money, but they're also able to offer things like 2-factor authentication.

A perfect series of steps hasn't been figured out yet, and probably won't be until several days after Aug 1. If you're committed to splitting right away, here's a quick and dirty way of doing it:
1. After 12:20 UTC (or maybe you need to wait for 1 BCH block?), send all of your BTC to a totally new wallet and wait until this gets 30 confirmations. Just creating new addresses is not sufficient: you must create a totally new wallet file with a different mnemonic, etc. BCH has some replay protection (note: contrary to what they say, it is not complete replay protection, unless they changed it since I last heard), so this should typically not be replayed. Just in case it is replayed, the destination wallet should also be under your complete control.
2. Import your old private keys into a BCH wallet on a separate computer, or upload them to a BCH exchange/bank. Never use that wallet file again.
This is sub-optimal in several ways, but it's reasonably safe and easy.
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:05:06

The NSA vaguely recommending something isn't really evidence for anything. As this article mentions, there's a whole 19-page paper by respected cryptographers discussing all of the possibilities for what the NSA could be doing here. We really can't take much of anything from the NSA's statement at this time. The public academia knows of no hints whatsoever of any weakness in ECC. And the NSA is known to often give bad advice and insert backdoors into standards, so there's a good chance that they're actually recommending this because it makes people *less* secure. In particular, they seem to recommend sticking with RSA rather than moving to ECC, but RSA is IMO is one of the most likely algorithms to be compromised (since it is simple mathematically and also by far the most widely-used).

That's not a good analogy because it implies *progress*. Miners are at no point "making progress" toward solving a block. Rather, miners are buying billions of lottery tickets each second. Faster miners get more lottery tickets than slow miners. You can get 1 lottery ticket in less than a second on virtually any device, and you *can* win with just 1 lottery ticket, but the chance is absolutely minuscule because each ticket has an unbelievably low chance of winning the lottery (ie. solving the block). Currently you need to buy 3 sextillion tickets to have a 50% chance of winning the lottery.

Bitcoin Core needs to be able to access all of the blocks when running (if you don't enable pruning), but if you can install an additional old disk permanently, you could symlink some of the blk*.dat files in the `blocks` directory to copies on a separate disk. I wrote a little more about this here: 
The main reasons why you'd want to not use the pruning option are:
* With pruning, you can't rescan. Rescanning is often pretty useful.
* With pruning, you won't help the network deliver historical blocks to people who want them. Historical blocks are needed by all full nodes doing the initial sync, even if they enable pruning, and also by all Bitcoin network nodes (even lightweight nodes) that are catching up after being offline for a while. It's planned to improve this in the future by letting pruned nodes store a random range of x MB of historical blocks, and signalling to lightweight nodes that you keep the most recent y MB of the most recent blocks, but currently, pruned nodes will not perform these functions at all. They will still relay transactions and blocks, and if you use Bitcoin Core for your own real transactions, you will contribute to Bitcoin's [economic security](
If you're thinking of enabling pruning, you might consider backing up your `blocks` and `chainstate` directories to one of your external drives beforehand so that you can move back to non-pruned mode more easily in case you want to do a rescan or whatever in the future.

I don't see why. Orphaning non-compliant miners is how softforks work. The threshold percentage is fairly arbitrary. For example, due to miners stupidly signalling support for BIP 66 without actually supporting it, BIP 66 activated with only around 60% miner support, and this only caused minor hiccups (mainly due to the surprise/confusion).

Hardforks should in fact be done based on time triggers like that. Miners don't have any say in hardforks, and shouldn't be allowed to block them via "voting".
`maxblocksize = largerlimit` seriously simplifies the necessary changes. For example, at the time Satoshi wrote that, his client couldn't handle even 500-750kB blocks, and would start randomly rejecting blocks larger than that. This led to the BIP50 incident a few years later. Before you increase the stated weight limit on an airplane, you have to make sure that the extra weight won't make it crash...
In some ways, BIP148/BIP149 are doing what Satoshi said there, since SegWit is a max-block-size increase, and these BIPs can activate them by time trigger.

Probably yes, but you could say the same about P2SH to a lesser degree. 99.9% of the economy enforces P2SH if they enforce anything, but thebitcoin.foundation's software is used by a few people, and they intentionally do not enforce P2SH.
Security will improve with time. Nobody really used P2SH right away in part because it was known to be similarly imperfectly-solid. It becomes ~perfectly solid over the course of 2-3 years, as the economy both starts to enforce it and to use it, so that violating its rules becomes unthinkable. SegWit already has a ~1-year head start over P2SH due to the way it was deployed, so while I wouldn't have recommended using P2SH for anything except tiny amounts for quite some time after it was activated, I think it'll be reasonable to store hundreds of BTC in SegWit addresses after a couple weeks, and thousands in 3-6 months.

Traditional public-key crypto algorithms all rely (directly or indirectly) on the assumption that it's difficult to factor very large numbers. Quantum computers can very efficiently factor large numbers using Shor's Algorithm. So it is known *for sure* that RSA, DSA, and Bitcoin's ECDSA will be totally broken if a large enough quantum computer was ever created. But it seems that we're ~10-20 years away from this yet, so these algorithms are still considered safe.
Lamport signatures instead use only hash functions. Hash functions are not vulnerable to Shor's Algorithm because they don't have anything to do with prime numbers. They are vulnerable to Grover's Algorithm, but this only square-roots the security (ie. SHA-256 has its security reduced from 256-bit=2^256 to 128-bit=2^128), which is acceptable when you're dealing with 256-bit crypto. Additionally, cryptographers generally feel much safer with crypto based on scrambling input (all commonly-used symmetric encryption and hash functions) rather than crypto based on applying mathematical functions believed to be "one-way" (all commonly-used public-key crypto), since it's considered probably much easier to figure out how to undo the "one-wayness" of mathematical functions than to undo the kind of scrambling used in stuff like SHA-2.
Lamport signatures are also a lot faster than traditional public-key crypto. The reason that they're almost never used is that their signatures and public keys are *vastly* larger, and at a basic level Lamport public keys can only safely be used to sign something *once* -- you'd need some additional structure (a tree of public keys or something) to support multiple signatures.
There are also quantum-resistant mathematical asymmetric encryption techniques such as supersingular ECC, but this is a somewhat immature area of research, and I certainly know basically nothing about it.

Two options are usually considered:
* Merged mining: Bitcoin miners would choose to participate in validating the sidechain, and the sidechain's security would require that most of the participating miners are honest.
* Blocks would only be produced by a centralized set of verifiers, without PoW. This is how Elements and Liquid work. (Obviously the centralization of this makes it unacceptable in many cases.)
I've wondered if maybe there's a way to link sidechains more directly with Bitcoin by including some sidechain linking data in a Bitcoin transaction or something. It seems to me that this would have better properties overall.

Cuckoo is memory-hard, which doesn't give FPGAs an advantage AFAIK.
Possibly, the new PoW should make mining unprofitable for *everyone*. Then the only miners would be:
* Bitcoin true believers.
* People looking for the cleanest coins.
* If there is only a slight negative EV, gamblers. (In this case, you could often make more than you put in if you're lucky.)
* Problematically, maybe botnets.
If the Bitcoin economy is big enough, this might be enough to protect against any likely attacker, especially if this anti-ASIC PoW is combined with an ASIC-friendly PoW and PoS in a hybrid system, as I've suggested in the past.
@_date: 2016-05-11 09:59:20
That's probably the strongest argument against it, but I don't really see much of a slippery slope. IMO there's a very wide gap between applying a uniform policy meant to address a specific *technical*/*security* issue, and doing targeted deletions. (The majority of miners could already do targeted deletions, BTW, which is a huge concern which should be addressed by widespread usage of CoinSwap, etc. and efforts to decentralize mining.)
Maybe I find this idea less surprising because this general idea of expiring old UTXOs has *long* been discussed in the context of scaling. If you expire UTXOs after a year or whatever, it limits the size of the UTXO set and also allows for several other nice optimizations. I (and others) were talking about this as early as 2011, and some altcoins have implemented versions of the idea. Later on, far better scaling technologies were developed which put this concept (often called "demurrage" in the Bitcoin universe, though it's very different from this word's usual meaning outside of Bitcoin) out of fashion. But I've always thought that it's an acceptable technique, if Bitcoin's survival requires it.
I don't think this will actually be a problem for 10-20 years, so we'll have plenty of time to debate it...

No, that's often repeated but wrong. SegWit *is* a blocksize increase, with all associated costs and benefits. SegWit is like adding another box, whereas a hardfork increase would be replacing the small box with a bigger box. Either way, it's a max-block-size increase.

Right. If Coinbase promotes XT to customers on coinbase.com and/or switches all of its full nodes to BIP 101 software, then Coinbase is no longer using the Bitcoin currency, and it doesn't belong on This also applies to bitcointalk.org (where Coinbase would be restricted to the altcoin section). Bitcoin.it and bitcoin.org have similar policies. In fact, Coinbase was already [almost removed]( from bitcoin.org due to your past statements in this matter.
If Coinbase is actually considering doing this, then you need to spend less time reading comments from idiots on and more time talking to people who actually know what they're talking about. If you have not had a long conversation with Wladimir or Greg about this issue, then WTF are you even doing? It is possible (but not assured) that a coalition of Coinbase and some other big exchanges could apply enough economic pressure to force through a hardfork vis-à-vis the economic majority, but:
* If you fail, it will massively damage you.
* If you succeed, it will massively damage Bitcoin. A large percentage of users will refuse to switch, so you've automatically reduced the size of the Bitcoin economy. And BIP 101 itself is basically suicidal.

BIP148's forced signalling thing is only possible this one time, due to the existing BIP141-via-BIP9 deployment. BIP9 will probably never be used again.
The point of the discount is in part to reverse the current situation where it's cheaper to send someone coins than for them to spend it. This is both annoying and harmful to the system, since the existence of unspent coins is a major burden on the network. Also, if there's no discount, then SegWit can't increase the max block size at all -- the discount is the means through which it achieves a max block size increase.


That's not a major issue. Currently, you can mine by downloading just headers and assuming that the most-work chain is valid. But if you're only downloading headers, then it's extremely risky to include any transactions in your block because you don't have any info about spent/unspent coins. If you want to include transactions, then you have to download the whole previous block. With SegWit, a new intermediate state between headers-only mining and proper mining is introduced: you can download headers and just the non-witness data. This allows miners to include transactions in their blocks with the same risk of mining an invalid block as headers-only mining.
Any form of validationless mining is sub-optimal, but:
* Bitcoin as a whole does not depend on miners verifying anything. If the majority of miners start mining invalid blocks, then they will be ignored by the economy. Only SPV-type lightweight node need to worry about this -- it's the cost of using a lightweight node.
* This intermediate form of validationless mining is only slightly worse (if worse at all) than headers-only validationless mining.
It'd probably be better for it to be fixed, but if this doesn't happen, it won't worry me to leave it as-is.

Yes, it's ridiculous. All tax, but especially income tax, should be eliminated.
I was thinking a while ago about what would be the best way to change the law to improve this if the tax can't be eliminated entirely. The best I came up with was that people could choose to either use the current rules OR apply some percentage tax on every Bitcoin transaction that isn't to yourself. That'd be much easier to calculate, at least, but it's still far from ideal. Maybe someone else can come up with something better. (I doubt anything like this is actually going to happen, though...)
Some people have called for reclassifying Bitcoin as a foreign currency, but I don't think that this would help. You can only ignore currency gains under a certain amount, and Bitcoin is so volatile that you'd still end up having to keep track of everything.

You can send a transaction with a total output value of *zero*, and even this will be relayed by stock Bitcoin Core if the fee is sufficient. But required fees are based on transaction size, not value, and the default fee per kilobyte is far higher than a few satoshi, so sending such small amounts doesn't make sense unless the transaction is useful in some way other than transferring value. Each node and miner chooses their fee policies freely, but if the BTC price goes up, fees will almost certainly go down to compensate.
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:17:55
If none of the economy ran full nodes, or if no full nodes enforced the SegWit rules, then you'd be trusting miners 100%, and I would very much not consider this secure. This is "minimal security".
If all of the economy ran independent full nodes and all of these full nodes enforced the SegWit rules, then miners would be powerless to do anything except reorder transactions, which is somewhat dangerous, but limited in many ways. It'd even be safe for the network if nearly all miners mined without verifying anything, though it wouldn't be rational for miners to do this (*because* the economy would ignore them). This is "maximal security".
In the current reality, I'd guess that we have maybe 90% of the economy not using light-SPV at least (though a lot of this involves centralized verifiers like Electrum servers, bc.i, etc.), and maybe 80% of that portion is enforcing the SegWit rules. So we're somewhat short of maximal security in any case, and SegWit transactions are slightly further from maximal security than normal transactions are: by breaking the SegWit rules, miners would be (according to my guessed numbers) fighting/leaving 90% \* 80% = 72% of the economy rather than the 90% of the economy they'd leave if they broke older rules like OP_CHECKSIG validity. Though you shouldn't take this like "Miners have a 100% - 72% = 28% chance of stealing SegWit transactions" or anything like that, since if this sort of split *did* happen, I'd expect most of the estranged part of the economy to quickly modify their software to join up with the rest; in fact, even if there was a 75-25 split due to 25% of the economy rejecting the longest chain for a sane reason, IMO it's not too unlikely that the 75% would join the 25%.
BTW, people who talk about "anyone-can-spend" in this context usually don't know what they're talking about. Native/unwrapped-P2SH SegWit outputs can be spent by anyone *from the perspective of old/non-SegWit nodes*, but you could similarly say that OP_CHECKSIG is "anyone-can-spend" if miners are allowed to ignore the rules. The point is that SegWit changes the rules so that anyone *cannot* spend them, and from the perspective of SegWit nodes, this rule is *equal in strength* to what makes OP_CHECKSIG not anyone-can-spend.

Yeah, my preferred solution would be 1/3 ASIC-hard, 1/3 ASIC-easy, and 1/3 PoS. Each group might have some centralization, but it's unlikely that this centralization will extend *between* groups. I know that a lot of people are pretty skeptical of PoS, and it's clear that pure PoS can't really work, but my intuition is that it adds something when used in combination with real PoW. And since PoS mining is nearly free, it should probably get less than a third of subsidies and fees.

It's the same thing; websites are just data.
Anonymous/decentralized data storage is the only way you'll get true anonymity, I think. Point-to-point systems like Tor hidden services are inherently weak to timing-based attacks, flow analysis, etc. Freenet already does decentralized data storage, including a system for websites, and it generally works well from an end-user perspective. But Freenet's design is very haphazard, so I have absolutely no confidence in Freenet's ability to actually provide anonymity or censorship-resistance.
I've been thinking recently that for this sort of thing maybe it'd be best to design a centralized but anonymous and plausibly-deniable system where:
* You have several centralized but independent servers, like the 9 Tor directory authorities which run the entire Tor network.
* Anyone can upload data to the servers, maybe with an associated fee. The servers can't figure out anything about what data you uploaded.
* Anyone can download data from the servers, maybe with an associated fee. The servers can't figure out anything about what data you downloaded.
* It's impossible to prove that any one server contains any particular piece of data. 
I don't know how you'd do this, but it strikes me as plausibly possible by extending existing private information retrieval systems.
P.S. These data storage systems should never use a block chain -- it's a total mismatch.

There are myriad ways in which an economically-viable split *mightn't* happen. I think that it probably won't. *But it could,* and in this case the risk of some sort of disturbance has become too great to let people carry on in blissful ignorance.
I [really doubt]( that "segwit2x" will activate SegWit. If it does, then I will be surprised, but that'll be great. If it doesn't, then there are various possible outcomes:
* *Most likely IMO*, BIP148 will totally fail economically. You'll see just Luke and a few others using it for longer than a few hours, and the miners supporting it will immediately drop out when they see that they're mining worthless "BIP148-BTC". Probably fewer than 6 total BIP148 blocks will be mined.
* Another somewhat likely outcome is that BIP148 will gather enough support from miners and the economy to survive for at least a while as a spin-off altcoin in the same vein as ETC. Then people need to worry about replay, splitting coins, incompatibility, and (initially) possible long reorgs between the semi-compatible chains.
* A very unlikely outcome, but possible, is that BIP148 will have majority economic support, but not enough mining support to trigger BIP141. Then it may become necessary for people to switch to BIP148 nodes in order to avoid accepting invalid blocks. Additionally, a nightmare scenario can occur where miners refuse to mine BIP148 for a long time, but eventually relent in the face of significant economic support; this could *wipe out entire days of transaction history*. It's also possible that miners could attack Bitcoin at some point here, leading to disappearing confirmations and the subsequent need for an immediate PoW-change hardfork.
Without actually going into details about the above somewhat-scary possible outcomes, the bitcoin.org alert provides guidance that will protect against any of them.

No, BIP91 will never hardfork under any circumstances. It merely reduces the SegWit activation threshold from 95% to 80%. You can see the text and reference implementation of BIP91 [here](
The reason that people are getting confused about this is that some people have agreed, in an out-of-band, non-binding way, to do BIP91 first and then try a hardfork months later. But success of BIP91 doesn't say anything about this hardfork. It's important to note that *it is impossible in Bitcoin for someone to force you to accept a hardfork*.

Although it's not *mathematically* private -- it is theoretically possible to get some identifying clues from CryptoNote transactions without breaking any of the underlying crypto -- in reality it tends to anonymize very well, especially with Monero's RingCT. (Though Monero's encouragement of address reuse is not good, and can cause you to leak info out-of-band even despite them being stealth addresses.) Its method of anonymization has *very* severe scaling downsides, however; CryptoNote makes Bitcoin look Visa-scale.
I think that zcash should theoretically have somewhat better anonymization and scaling properties, but it relies on esoteric/experimental crypto, and the current software isn't very good.

If you run a lightweight node, then you can be tricked into accepting invalid transactions. This can cause you to lose a lot of money. For example, if you accept 100 bitcoins that don't actually exist and then ship the sender some gold in exchange, you'll have lost that gold. Therefore, anyone who automatically processes Bitcoin transactions **must** run their own full node, and anyone accepting large amounts of BTC should probably also think about running one.

You can have a large number of receiving addresses. It's intended that you use one address per transaction. While addresses do not expire in Bitcoin Core, receiving multiple transactions using the same address is discouraged for reasons of privacy and security.
You can generate a new address by clicking the "receive" tab, filling out as much of the form as you want (you can leave all fields blank if you want, but for your own organization you should at least fill out "label"), clicking "request payment", and then copying the address you're given.
The payment might not appear for several reasons:
* You might not be fully syncronized with the network. This often takes a few days. Other wallets will synchronize instantly, but Bitcoin Core is the most secure, and you also help Bitcoin by running it.
* You might have no connections to the network.
* The payment might have been sent, but due to its small value and low fee, it is not being relayed very well, and it will take a long time for it to get into a block. Transactions propagate better and get into blocks more quickly when they move more bitcoins and have higher fees.
* Because of the above point, "free Bitcoin" sites often wait to send you any bitcoins until you've reached some payout limit. You should read their documentation.

Bitcoin is certainly not majoritarian in that (as you mention), even if you are using rules incompatible with every other person on the network, this will just result in you being on your own network. You aren't forced to follow the decisions of the majority of the network. In fact, there's no safe way for full nodes to vote, since they can't be uniquely identified. Miners *kind of* vote, but only in a very limited scope -- they can't break the rules of the network.
In some sense you could say that Bitcoin is whatever the majority of economic power is doing. If pretty much every Bitcoin exchange is using one version of the Bitcoin network, then that's probably what people mean when they say "Bitcoin". But if everyone switches to a version of Bitcoin without a fixed money supply, could that still be considered Bitcoin? It's debatable.

It looks like Coinkite doesn't support multisig there. Coinkite wants you to sign using an xpub address (which is "single-sig"), but you're trying to sign with a multisig P2SH address (which is impossible).

No, reducing the threshold by orphaning non-SegWit-signalling blocks is something that miners do, not nodes. For nodes to hard-enforce it is either redundant or will result in a non-miner-supported UASF, so you might as well just do a proper UASF if you're doing that.
This way of reducing the threshold was known and sort-of-planned since SegWit was rolled out. [Here]( I mentioned it and the UASF method a year ago. The exact BIP91 mechanism of using version bits didn't occur to me -- I thought that miners would agree to do it out-of-band and then just start doing it once they got more than 50% --, though BIP91 has some advantages.

It's a very good idea to run Bitcoin Core, the other people don't know what they're talking about. See [here]( for more info about that.
That warning is related to BIP91 signalling, and can be safely ignored in this case. It exists to warn you about BIP9 softforks deployed after your version of Bitcoin Core, but miners are (ab)using the mechanism for BIP91.

If it starts with L or M then it should've been refused. Though Litecoin originally copy-pasted Bitcoin's P2SH code without changing the version byte, so addresses starting with 3 were originally ambiguous, though this was later changed to M on Litecoin. (But some wallets may still support Litecoin 3-addresses.)
Anyway, Bitcoin and Litecoin private keys are compatible (Litecoin is like 99.9% a copy-paste of Bitcoin), so if you can get the Litecoin private key, it should be possible to import it into a Bitcoin wallet and get the BTC you sent there. If it's a P2SH address starting with 3, it could be some multisig arrangement which would be more complicated, though it's probably still somehow possible.

If BIP148 had been actively deployed immediately after it was created, then it'd have a 6-month delay, which is the lowest delay under consideration for BIP149. But it wasn't seriously pushed until a couple months ago. These delays should be measured from when people actually start upgrading en masse.
Probably less than 5% of the overall Bitcoin community has even heard of BIP148. The Bitcoin community is much larger than just &gt; We're not going to get a better shot at a UASF than right now.
I don't see any reason why that'd be true. If BIP148 were successful, it'd be *especially convenient*, but it's not required. If BIP141 took 1.5 years (or whatever) in order to get the very widespread support that it has now, then that could be done again with a BIP8 deployment starting when BIP141 expires. There's no reason to think that this wouldn't get the same support as BIP141 and then obviously succeed. And probably you can actually accelerate this to the 6-12 months being talked about.

From the US you have to use an international wire transfer. In addition to the fee that BitStamp charges, your bank and any intermediate banks will charge fees adding up to $25-$75. So it's only suitable for amounts above a few thousand dollars, I'd say.

BIP91 works like this:
* Miners signal bit 4.
* If ~80% of miners are signalling bit 4, a timer starts.
* At the end of the timer, miners **hard-reject** any blocks that don't signal bit 1.
* Since 100% of blocks on the longest chain are now signalling bit 1, BIP141 (SegWit) activates via the originally-planned BIP9 95% process.
BIP91 does *not* include any hardfork or anything. It's just a way of activating SegWit at a lower threshold.

* Ridiculously expansive governments, which create massive incentives for illegal immigration and often handle immigrants in unbelievably insecure/insane ways, far different from any sane private property owner, in the name of some arbitrary idea of "equality".
* Laws against discrimination. If you don't trust SOME_GROUP, it is absolutely your right to exclude them from your property, speak out strongly against them (even to the point of bigotry), etc. (It is not your right to violently agress against them, however.)

That's how you'd expect it to work if some section of the Bitcoin economy was splitting off and forming a new currency, like a stock spin-off. For example, if Coinbase decided to drop support for BTC and support only BCH, you can imagine that this would reduce the value of BTC and increase the value of BCH. But in BCH's case it'll probably be pure pump-and-dump with no real economy behind it, like most altcoins, and so it'll get value from pure speculation rather than by breaking off a piece of Bitcoin's economy. Speculators who buy BCH will I suppose mostly be motivated by the greater fool theory (as with most altcoins), possibly with a few true believers who think that BCH will take Bitcoin's market share later on via competition.

Interesting idea, though I don't know that the final axes really convey much meaningful information.
Blocksize score -27.08316  
Flexibility score -46.1538 
I'll explain some of my answers:


Agree. The blocksize limit should be as large as safely possible, and it is generally agreed that at least 2MB of overall data is safe (ignoring UTXOs).


Strongly agree. Bitcoin's main goal is as a secure store of value, and it can survive at 1MB indefinitely.


I break with most decentralists in agreeing with this. Mining rewards won't be much of a consideration for quite some years yet, and even then I think that things like assurance contracts might be useful.


Agree, the fee that Bitcoin users must pay is currently far too high. Though the current *on-chain* fee is not necessarily too high -- the main problem is that currently *on-chain fee* = *Bitcoin fee*.


Strongly disagree. I wouldn't be crushed if some reckless altcoin got more popular than Bitcoin for a while. Bitcoin should be the cryptocurrency that lasts decades without failure, and it doesn't necessarily need to be the most popular cryptocurrency in that time (though that would be nice).


Agree, because I agree with the overall sentiment. Certainly it's true with on-chain transactions. Though with off-chain systems, Bitcoin could be even better than those things.


Agree due to the overall sentiment, though I don't think that it's actually true that you could generate on-chain transactions only after a dispute arises.


Disagree, this is Bitcoin's main point. I didn't strongly disagree because maybe there are *a few* circumstances even long-term where it'd be reasonable not to validate everything, and in the future it might be OK to not validate *some* very old stuff.


Agree as a long-term goal of the overall Bitcoin system.


Confusing question. Agree because that's the whole point of the blocksize limit, I suppose. Though the limit should be as high as safely possible.


Strongly disagree, people who believe this have a misunderstanding of the supply/demand at play here. The blockspace is more of a natural resource than something created by miners.


Agree due to the sentiment, though it's not a clear question. If there is no bidding, then how will spammers outbid anyone?
If there is limited blockspace, then a fee market is the best way to fill it.


Disagree, though this is a technical question which depends on the circumstances.


Agree with the overall sentiment that the fee market doesn't work as envisioned by Satoshi, though I think that alternatives might be possible without artificially limiting block space.


Disagree, there are probably other ways of keeping blocks moving forward, such as commitments in transactions.


Strongly agree, this is why Satoshi's fee market idea doesn't work.


Strongly disagree, exponential growth is not guaranteed forever, and is not actually observed in some areas.


Disagree rather than strongly disagree because I tend to think that mining is hopelessly centralized and can't be salvaged.


Disagree. Bitcoin *can* work just fine like that, but then lightweight nodes are totally insecure. You can either have verification at miners or at all wallets, but not neither.


Unclear question, but I said disagree because there's no reason to prioritize them.


Disagree, upgrading in order to get new benefits is not a big deal.


Agree. It's a good goal, though it may not *always* be possible.


Agree, probably a good idea, though not strictly necessary.


If there is any possibility that a minority *intentionally* does not accept the upgrade, then it is unacceptible to deny them service. Although both outcomes are bad, it's better that the currency split than for one currency to be attacked. If it seems impossible that a minority would intentionally not upgrade, then it's OK, but that seems unlikely in the blocksize issue at least. So strongly disagree.

It's a good concern, and probably one of the weaker points in the crypto ecosystem. Both the Linux and OpenSSL CSPRNGs are kind of haphazard. I wouldn't be too surprised if one day a major flaw is found in one or the other, which would be 100x worse than heartbleed. Bitcoin Core combines randomness from both the OS and OpenSSL, and collects some of its own entropy, which should be OK in nearly all cases, but other wallets might not be so thorough.
If you've installed Linux to disk, then lack of entropy shouldn't be a big concern because any sane distro will save entropy across reboots, and the entropy quality increases over time. Live CDs and *especially* VMs are more worrying. To increase safety, it may be a good idea to manually add entropy to the Linux CSPRNG by running `echo "smash random keys here, maybe add some physical dice rolls, etc" &gt; /dev/urandom`, then wait 30 seconds (the Linux CSPRNG takes time to use new entropy), and *then* generate keys. Keep in mind that wallet software usually only generates keys once, when your wallet is first created: later addresses are derived from a master key.

There's no need.
Ethereum in particular doesn't scale whatsoever (among other issues): it's built on the model of "everyone dumps everything on the block chain, everyone downloads the block chain" -- when adding 2GB/day as it is now, and increasing, it eventually becomes virtually impossible to run a node. If you're trusting third-parties to run nodes for you, then you lose the desired properties of a decentralized system, especially in the case of decentralized DNS.

How it'll probably work is that you'll be able to select an amount of data to store for the network, from a minimum of ~1 GB (the space necessary to store UTXOs and recent blocks) to a maximum of ~30 GB (the size of all blocks). Storing more will help the network more, but storing only the minimum will still be somewhat helpful.

Running a BIP148 node is more-or-less the same as enforcing segsignal at this point. Core will probably not enforce segsignal for many of the same reasons that it didn't enforce BIP148: too high risk of an unnecessarily messy split. Peter thinks that there's a 25% chance that miners will renege, which means that there's a 25% chance anyone running a segsignal node will permanently diverge.
It's most prudent to use the current version of Core, which lacks any of these requirements except for the economically very-well-established BIP141. If you want to commit yourself to SegWit's activation, which comes with some risk, then running a BIP148 node would be best IMO.

I'm not a Foundation member anymore, but here are my thoughts on the candidates. Most of these people are not very well-known to me, so this is based 90% on the candidates' Foundation forum posts and their responses to the CryptoCoinNews questionnaire.
* Jim Harper: The plans/ideas he mentions are good. Doing more risk management studies sounds like a good idea, as does some degree of interaction with regulators. But I'd like to hear more details of what he sees as the appropriate scope of the Foundation.
* Cody Wilson: Wants to destroy the Foundation, which would be a wasted opportunity IMO.
* Bruce Fenton: Seems basically OK, though I get the feeling that he's a bit of an outsider trying to get a foothold here. He seems to want to positively influence regulations somewhat, which is something I think the Foundation is in a good position to do. I was disappointed by the apparent change in direction to supporting just core development, which IMO doesn't need that much more support. The legal situation needs much more work, and no one seems to be doing it. (*Certainly*, no one should be *asking* for regulations, but there are going to be regulations, and lobbying and other legal work can make them a little less painful.) But what are his overall principles? Can he be trusted?
* Olivier Janssens: I'd like to know more of his thoughts on dealing with regulators. Also, he says: "I think having the Bitcoin Foundation in control of core development is dangerous", which shows that he doesn't really understand the situation: the Foundation has very little to do with development, and in fact currently has almost no influence over Bitcoin. Oliver spent $100k on Lighthouse, which is a good project. His objectives seem pretty reasonable in general.
* Michael Perklin: Doesn't stand out to me much. He's opposed to dealing with regulators at all, which IMO is a bit of a lost opportunity.
* Colin Gallagher: I agree with the spirit of most of what he says. But he seems to think that people and the Foundation should mostly ignore and disobey bad regulations, which may eventually work in the long-term, but which IMO is not the best strategy right now. Also, it's unclear to me what he thinks the Foundation should do.
* Theo Chino: No info.
* Dima Starodubcev: Doesn't say much.
* Scott Morgan: Seems basically OK, though I find his obsessive devotion to the idea of Satoshi's code/whitepaper to be kind of pointless. Satoshi himself changed the code many times, sometimes in backward-incompatible ways, and this process has continued since he left. It's usually counter-productive to think too much about Satoshi's actions/views. I get the feeling that he would not be especially effective as a board member.
* Bayan Towfiq: No info.
* Francis Pouliot: Says the Foundation should be "taking a leadership position in hard forks", which strikes me as a very pro-centralization position. He's also overly aggressive in his dealings with other candidates.
* Jeremy Gardner: I get the sense that he doesn't really know what he thinks about a lot of stuff in this space. If he's elected, I don't know what he'd do.
If I was able to vote, I'd research this more and ask the candidates some questions before doing so. But with the knowledge I have now, I would approve these candidates:
* Olivier Janssens
* Jim Harper

This sort of attack is probably only possible if the network isn't functioning correctly. Full nodes can deal with a slightly weakened network, but lightweight nodes can't. Lightweight nodes will continue to see incorrect info until the network is made strong again. Exactly how this works depends on what is wrong with the network.
BitcoinJ-based lightweight nodes (ie. most of them) only connect to peers returned by four centralized DNS seeds. So compromising or intercepting all of the DNS seeds (or compromising one and DDoSing the others) is one way to make the network "weak" in a way that affects lightweight nodes but not full nodes. There are several other ways. Generally the attacker will need at least enough mining power to produce ~1 valid block per day, which is one reason why this sort of attack hasn't been tried before.
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:25:19
If the network can safely support increasing the max block size at that point, then it should be done, and the reduced competition for block space will result in the minimum relay fee automatically being reduced under this new mempool handling policy. If the network can't safely support it, then it should not be done, and this new policy will handle the scarcity better than previously.
Now, there are a huge variety of opinions about what would be safe and what wouldn't be. Some think that removing the max block size entirely would be safe, and others think that currently even 1 MB is somewhat unsafe. But that's not really important to the present discussion of this policy, which is better than the old policy in pretty much every way, no matter what the max block size is.


Perhaps this particular pull request is imperfect in some ways, but the idea of a fee market is not a stop-gap measure, and it's not being sold as such: it is AFAIK *the* best, most fair, and most appropriate way of dealing with scarcity in this case.
When I say that a fee market is good, I'm not saying that we should artificially limit supply so that we can have a fee market; I'm saying that a fee market is a good way of dealing with limited supply, whether the underlying limitation on supply is natural or artificial. (There are reasonable arguments for artificially limiting block space in 5-10 years to ensure sufficient mining reward, though I personally don't think that this will be necessary.)

It's important to realize that whey they say "breaking a private key by observing only 6 signatures", they mean that the attacker needs to be on the same machine that's performing the signatures, observing and interacting with the machine's CPU as the signatures are being computed. They're not saying that you can look at 6 signed messages and compute the private key. (This is really obvious when you start reading the paper, but I think that a lot of people will read only the title of this submission.)

I agree that the max block size should be raised soon, but I don't think that Bitcoin can support a *very* large increase right now, and I don't think that Bitcoin would be *absolutely worthless* if it was kept at 1 MB forever.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:34:43
I've been noticing a lot of people saying things like, "If the block size isn't raised, then that would be bad because ..." But just *wanting* larger blocks isn't a good argument for increasing the max block size. Everyone agrees that *if safely possible*, cheaper and more transactions would be great. But by far the most important issue is what the network *can actually support*. Bitcoin is the most inefficient transaction system ever devised. (This is necessary for decentralization.) Scaling to Visa-level capacities will maybe be possible someday, but it's probably not possible now and it's certainly going to be far more expensive than Visa if it does happen. We're just going to have to learn to deal with the fact that the network's capacity is limited and fees will probably always be larger than many people want. We've lived with scarcity forever -- it's not going to kill us in this case.
Exactly what block size the network can support is very much debatable. I currently think that 10 MB would be fine and 50 MB (for example) would be too much, though these are mostly just feelings. There should be more rigorous study of the actual limits of the network. Gavin's done some nice work on the software/hardware front, though I'm still worried about the capabilities of typical Internet connections, and especially how they'll increase over time.

Yeah, it's impossible to prove that someone is running a distinct full node. They could always be running one full node with thousands of IPs -- there's no way to detect this automatically. If rewarding full nodes was safely possible, the Bitcoin network would already do it.
I think that Bitcoin Core should at some point try to identify useless peers and disconnect them when the number of free connection slots is running low, though. A peer could be considered more useful if they:
* Send you valid, relayable, never-before-seen transactions or blocks.
* Send you info about useful peers.
* Respond correctly to requests for data.
* Can prove that they are a full node. This'd require protocol extensions.
* Do some sort of proof of work. (Proof of storage would probably work best.)

If 75% signals only bit 4 (BIP91) and 25% signals only bit 1 (the original SegWit deployment), then nothing happens until the BIP148 UASF on Aug 1. But that's kind of a ridiculous scenario, first of all because you can (and probably should) signal *both* bits 1 and 4 (they don't conflict), and because there's not really any reason for people who are currently signalling bit 1 not to also support BIP91.

Since Satoshi's version 0.1, Bitcoin Core has always used the annoying Berkley DB (BDB) format for wallets. BDB is the same across different platforms, but different *versions* of BDB are incompatible with each other, so Bitcoin Core has long come bundled with an ancient version of BDB for compatibility. Therefore, any wallet created by one of the official binaries from the last ~5 years (I guess) should be compatible with the latest versions. However, if you compile it yourself in a weird way, it's possible to mess up and use a different BDB version, which will make it incompatible. Several Linux distros have done this in their versions of Core published in their repositories, which causes those wallets to be incompatible. The BDB project has a tool for upgrading/downgrading BDB databases which should be able to fix this if it happens, but I've never actually tried it.
Other wallets do different things. They're all different.

If the max block size is too low, then competition for block space will cause transaction fees to increase. If fees are too high, then Bitcoin is far less useful.
If the actual average block size is too high, then very few people will be able to run full nodes, and Bitcoin will be either destroyed outright or become centralized and therefore useless. (If Bitcoin becomes centralized, then it will have no advantages over the traditional banking system, and it will therefore become the most pointlessly inefficient transaction system ever devised.)
The reason that too-large blocks result in centralization is because only full nodes check the validity of blocks and transactions, in order to be a full node you *must* download all transactions, and bandwidth is limited. Increasing the average block size increases the number of transactions that full nodes must download, and therefore reduces the number of people who can afford to run full nodes. If only Coinbase-level companies can run full nodes, then Coinbase-level companies will control Bitcoin, and Bitcoin won't be much better than the traditional banking system. (There's another serious issue with not having enough full nodes related to mining incentives, but for simplicity I'm not going to explain that here.)
I think that the above statements are pretty widely agreed-upon. The main points of contention are:
* If the software's hard max block size is removed, what will the actual average block size be?
* What block size is "too high", and what block size is "too small"?
* Related to the above point, how many full nodes does the network need to remain "sufficiently decentralized"? Right now even dial-up users can run full nodes if they have the existing block chain shipped to them first: would excluding such people be a major hit to decentralization? What about excluding roughly all residential users, but allowing most businesses?
My own opinion is:
* Miners do not have sufficient incentive to keep blocks small. Removing the max block size wouldn't result in "infinite"-size blocks, but probably in blocks that are too large.
* The number of people who are capable of running full nodes should always increase. Therefore, if the worldwide typical bandwidth can *with high confidence* be expected to increase at least 10KB/s every year, then it'd be OK to increase the max block size such that an additional 10KB/s is required for full nodes every year. I don't know anything about the actual data here -- someone with more experience in statistical research should look into this.
* Gavin's proposal sounds too large to me, though again, I don't know anything about the data. Without seeing some decent data, my position on Gavin's proposed rate of increase is "weakly oppose". I also strongly oppose his proposed method of implementing the hard fork.

There's always a chance that Bitcoin will fail completely, be out-competed, or that the price will stabilize at a fairly low value for a very long time. Just 5 years ago the Bitcoin client warned users, "Experimental software: **Do not use for actual financial transactions**" :)
Even if you're very optimistic (which I am), Bitcoin can be looked at like a bet where you make a lot of money with, for example, probability 90% and lose all of your investment with probability 10%. Most people can't tolerate that much risk, and it isn't necessary to accept that much risk to make reasonable returns in more traditional diversified investments.

Right. The relay fee limits have always been a bit of a hack. The upcoming mempool limiting solution will work much better. Probably how it'll work (more-or-less) is that you'll have a configurable max mempool size (default ~500 MB), and when this fills up you'll discard the cheapest transaction in your mempool and then set your minrelaytxfee to the new minimum fee/kB in your mempool. Adjusting the future limit in this way will prevent the sort of DoS attacks that XT's random-discard solution is vulnerable to. There are various ways under discussion of making this mempool limiting better, in particular with the goal of allowing a certain volume of free or low-fee transactions, but this is the basic idea.
Another problem which has always existed in Bitcoin Core related to this is that there's no reasonable way to deal with transactions that are stuck due to having too-low fees. Satoshi's original software basically assumed that everyone had the same policies, and it's been difficult to work out of this situation even though everyone now acknowledges that it's a ridiculous idea. Some of the mempool policy proposals try to fix this via child-pays-for-parent (so the recipient of a transaction can add more fees to a transaction by spending its outputs) or via a guaranteed mempool expiry time (so wallets can more easily send updated versions of transactions with higher fees).

To play devil's advocate: you have to be **really** stupid to do something like this in order to make money. If you want to risk your life for *ideological* reasons, that's understandable, but the current anonymity technologies are so weak that running a DNM site for profit is probably similar in risk/reward to robbing a bank. And if someone is that stupid, it's not too unbelievable that their opsec is also garbage.
Symmetric encryption isn't broken -- nobody even knows where you'd begin to attack that. Asymmetric encryption (especially RSA) could conceivably be broken, but I don't think that intelligence agencies would use such a powerful tool on these small-time cases, even for parallel construction. Tor is rather weak, but IMO this is mostly due to known weaknesses rather than secret attacks; in particular, Tor really suffers from intersection attacks and attacks where the attacker is able to observe huge portions of the Internet at once (which intelligence agencies can maybe do). The biggest potential for parallel construction is IMO in exploits/malware (all computer systems are laughably, utterly insecure, and a lot of hardware might have backdoors) and data mining / mass surveillance.
I wish that more people were working in the anonymity space. Academia has produced a few systems which are superior to Tor in that they can defeat an attacker who is observing the entire Internet or they can tolerate 100% evil relays, but nobody's actually turned this into usable software yet. Also, I tend to think that point-to-point anonymity is inherently weak, and strong anonymity will only be found in anonymous distributed databases, but the existing examples of this are totally haphazard -- I definitely wouldn't trust Freenet, for example.

It's an interesting idea, though the Bitcoin dev team has never espoused it. There are several points in Satoshi's code for example where future changes were/are clearly required, such as limited timestamp length or the far-future subsidy calculation. Also, it's not possible to *technologically* prevent any changes because the whole concept of a currency prevents it from being 100% crypto/math/tech -- a lot of its utility comes from fallible human interactions. Even if you have a dev team with your philosophy and software which is built in every way possible to prevent any changes, a new dev team could supplant the original one and get almost all of the economy to softfork/hardfork to new software which hard-rejects some stuff or allows previously hard-rejected stuff. It'd be very good if there was some way of making hardforks impossible, but the whole concept of a hardfork brings it outside the realm of technology; a hardfork is after all basically abandoning the old currency and creating a new one with the same name and state. (Softforks *might* be preventable with esoteric crypto, but it's certainly non-trivial and maybe impossible.)
My philosophy is that since softforks and hardforks are possible, and impossible to make impossible, they may as well be used for good, though with the knowledge that they (especially hardforks) are extremely dangerous tools which mustn't be used lightly. Also, Bitcoin is blatantly insecure if a PoW-change hardfork is impossible since then miners would have no reason to do what they're supposed to except some economic incentives which are largely mismatched from what's required -- you might as well use [my joke cryptocurrency](
 sort of follows the idea of keeping Bitcoin "pure", though so far they haven't actually been tested by any circumstance which would cause them to diverge from the commonly-accepted idea of Bitcoin.

An additional distinction is breadwallet (etc.) vs Bitcoin Core. Breadwallet and other lightweight wallets trust someone else to say which transactions are valid, so they could be tricked into saying that you received bitcoins that don't actually exist, for example. Full-node wallets like Bitcoin Core will *never* accept an invalid transaction. See: 
blockchain.info has a very poor security/competence reputation, and Web wallets in general are inadvisable due to security issues with the Web/JavaScript model. A non-Web app or a hardware wallet is better. If you *must* use a Web wallet, GreenAddress looks most competent IMO.

Miners can accept/reject whatever fees they want, so there isn't one policy that's guaranteed to always work well. Usually any transaction with a not-completely-insubstantial fee will *eventually* confirm, though it might take quite a while.
Bitcoin Core 0.10 watches how fast transactions confirm on the network and recommends fees based on that. My Bitcoin Core is currently telling me:
If you want your tx to confirm after x blocks | Pay this per KB
1 | 0.00089285
2 | 0.00044843
3 | 0.00044444
4 | 0.00044444

No. A softfork means that old full nodes will still consider new blocks and transactions valid. A hardfork means that old full nodes will reject new blocks or transactions. If you're mining, then you always have to use the most current rules or else you're likely to produce an invalid block which will be rejected.

One thing to worry about is that the randomness might not have been good, especially if you used a liveCD. In that case, someone might eventually figure out how to recreate the random numbers which were used to generate your keys.
Also, although this isn't a reason to immediately switch, it is *strongly* recommend that people don't deal with keys directly. Doing so encourages address reuse and can lead to all sorts of nasty mistakes. It's recommended that you instead write an HD wallet mnemonic onto paper. See:

I very much agree that the Core devs are currently trustworthy and competent. But I really caution against getting into the mindset that Core is incorruptible or beyond reproach. All organizations are *invariably* corrupted: sometimes it takes a few generations, more often it takes only a few years. (Core isn't much of an organization *per se*, but that doesn't make it immune.) Anything in Bitcoin is at high risk of corruption, since Bitcoin stands in direct opposition to some of the most powerful forces on Earth. Therefore, while you definitely shouldn't knee-jerk oppose people or try to create needless/redundant "competition" (eg. the attempts to write full nodes from scratch rather than just forking Core have always been net-harmful endeavors), everyone should remain extremely vigilant.
I'd like it if there were more truly anonymous people in development. Some of the notable darknet pseudonymous people should try to get into the Core development scene a bit.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:57:54


I've thought about this problem a fair bit. Here's about the simplest possible way to do it that I can think of:
* Make a client which attaches to a Bitcoin full node and scans all Bitcoin transactions done over the last year, searching for OP_RETURN outputs with some magic bytes and a hash. These transactions must additionally have some minimum fee defined by the DNS consensus rules in order to prevent DoS attacks.
* The hash is the root of a hash tree. At the leaves are DNS transactions.
* Using a broadcast network similar to the Bitcoin P2P network, all DNS nodes download and store all DNS transactions, which are ordered via the Bitcoin linkage described above. Invalid DNS transactions are just ignored.
* The first/leftmost transaction in a DNS-transaction tree creates new DNSCoins equal to the fee paid on the DNS&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin linkage transaction minus the required fee mentioned above.
* All transactions which occurred more than a year ago are deleted/ignored; all DNSCoins (and their descendants) created more than a year ago disappear. This allows you to become a DNS node without downloading the whole Bitcoin history.
* To register a domain or transfer DNSCoins, you destroy some set amount of DNSCoins defined by the consensus rules. Maybe set the registration fee to $20 to start with, and if the value rises to $100 or falls to $5, it's not such a big deal. It can be changed with a hardfork of the DNS software if it becomes too crazy.
* There are various ways to initially hide the domain so that people don't "snipe" it from you.
* DNS transactions could just be used to associate a public key hash with each name. From there, you can use a separate system similar to the Tor hidden service directory system if you want, since timestamping is not needed; this increases efficiency.
Most people would register domains via some aggregator. The aggregator would collect DNS transactions and publish them in a single Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;DNS linking transaction, significantly improving efficiency. They'd also create and sell DNSCoins. But you could be your own aggregator without anyone's permission; it'd just be more expensive.
This uses one-way fees rather than some sort of 1-way or 2-way peg system because you want a flexible supply of domain names. One of the big flaws of a lot of decentralized DNS attempts so far is that they have the total supply of domains determined by some function of time. But domains are not bitcoins; you want the supply to more-or-less match demand, and demand cannot be predicted in advance by some formula. There is absolutely no reason for a DNS system to have a completely independent currency, and I find it hard to take seriously any attempt which does this -- it makes it look like just a pump-and-dump. (Another problem which many attempts have is that they allow a majority of miners to censor certain domains; my scheme lacks this problem.)
Some problems with this simple scheme:
* Someone creates free-copyrighted-material.bitdns. Now if your node serves any information about this, you could receive a DMCA takedown that you would *maybe* have to legally respond to by never serving any info about that domain. This would be problematic for node operators, and if a lot of people started censoring domains then the system wouldn't work well. Maybe you could mount a good legal defense, and maybe there'd be just so many people running nodes that it'd be difficult to attack them all, but it'd be far better if you could somehow make it impossible for a node to censor a domain, or even to know whether info about a domain exists anywhere in its database (this'd require sharding the whole set of domain knowledge). I haven't been able to figure out a good way of accomplishing this goal.
* It's not ideally efficient (eg. having many aggregators run at once will create more Bitcoin transactions than necessary), but maybe good enough.
* If someone submits a DNS root hash into Bitcoin but then withholds some or all of its data temporarily, this can create a mess. To fix it more generally probably requires miners to validate DNS-transaction existence, but that's a hassle and can create even more potential issues. It may be reasonable for nodes to say that if they talked to like 1000 different IPs in very different locations and were unable to find the data for ~24 hours, then they'll permanently mark it invalid. (And they'll also not mark any transaction as confirmed until 24 hours passed, in case it's later made invalid by missing data being found.) This is not all that robust, but maybe it'd fail rarely enough that you could get by with just some commands like bitcoind's invalidateblock etc. to allow for fixing any convergence issues out-of-band.
* The system I described does not give any security whatsoever if you don't download the last year of Bitcoin outputs. Lightweight lookups would have to involve trusting someone. This can probably be improved in more complex systems.

No, BIP91 will never hardfork under any circumstances. It merely reduces the SegWit activation threshold from 95% to 80%.
The reason that people are getting confused about this is that some people have agreed, in an out-of-band, non-binding way, to do BIP91 first and then try a hardfork months later. But success of BIP91 doesn't say anything about this hardfork. It's important to note that *it is impossible in Bitcoin for someone to force you to accept a hardfork*. People are used to far-off entities making decisions for them when dealing with governments and corporations, but this is *not* how Bitcoin works.

Their agreement uses a different version bit, bit 4, to activate "SegWit", so it's incompatible with all existing SegWit software. All versions of Core will see miners signalling bit 4 as signalling for some unknown softfork rather than SegWit. BIP148 on the other hand is compatible with existing software in that it forces miners to signal for SegWit using the BIP141 bit 1, so if BIP148 succeeds, all *existing* (pre-BIP148) SegWit software will start to enforce SegWit.


I agree that this would be the logical course of action if you already support BIP148. (Though I don't think that BIP148 will succeed, so I can't recommend using BIP148 software.)

Because people are already running BIP148, so you'll be more of an economic force if miners renege.

Two of those can't be avoided, but it's better to combine segsignal and BIP148.

It's a good idea. I've actually considered before that if I ever came into possession of any particularly valuable Bitcoin-related intellectual property, I'd probably set up something similar. Intellectual property is unjust, and any attempt to use it aggressively is immoral. It is OK to retain possession of patents etc. if it's for the purpose of protecting yourself and others from aggression. If it was me, I might've made the agreement stronger, allowing going after anyone who uses intellectual property aggressively in any situation.
I'm not qualified to evaluate the specific legal agreement. One concern I'd have is what happens to the patents if Blockstream goes bankrupt? For example, MtGox registered the Bitcoin trademark with similar intentions of protecting the Bitcoin community, but then it got snatched up by Bitflyer after the MtGox bankruptcy, and Bitflyer isn't bound by MtGox's original promise. (However, in most jurisdictions the Bitcoin trademark will clearly fail to hold up in court, so it's not a *huge* deal in this case.)

The Chrome extension is intended to stop this attack. Hardly anyone uses the extensions, though. Also, AFAIK the extension works by double-checking the page's JS against known hashes, which strikes me as a rather fragile way to do things. It seems likely that a smart attacker could find some way of tricking the extension.
If the app was entirely contained within an extension (like Dark Wallet), then that'd be way better, though I'm still uncomfortable with putting anything high-security in a browser.


Yes, it's a problem with any centralized tool.


With Bitcoin Core, you have all the data yourself, so no one can get info about your wallet from network traffic. (It's often still possible to glean some identity info from block chain analysis, though.)

Let's say you have sidechain A and sidechain B, both pegged to BTC at 1 BTC = 1 ACoin = 1 BCoin. If you want to do a direct transfer from A to B at the guaranteed peg rate, then you have to go A-&gt;BTC-&gt;B, which will have high fees and take a really long time.
However, you can alternatively do a market trade using an atomic chain swap. This doesn't require moving through BTC. You find someone with BCoins who wants ACoins (probably using some market site), and you sell 1 ACoin for 0.99999 BCoins or something. You might not get exactly the peg because this is a market trade instead of a pegged transfer, but the difference between the peg and the market value is very low because the guaranteed peg is pushing market prices very close to the peg value. This trade is as quick as it takes the transactions to confirm on both chains, and not as large as a sidechain-&gt;BTC pegged transfer transaction.
P.S. I notice in your other comment that you're confusing LN with a sidechain. LN has absolutely nothing to do with sidechains, and works in a completely different manner.

You can even today create a transaction that only becomes valid after a certain date. So for recurring payments you might create 6 months of such transactions, one per month, and give them to the recipient, but then still be able to cancel anytime by spending any of the inputs of those transactions, making them invalid.
One troublesome thing is that you need to recreate the transactions whenever you spend any of the bitcoins backing them. Though I'm not sure that it's a *huge* deal, since your wallet can just automatically recreate and resubmit subscription transactions whenever necessary.
I suppose the ideal smart contract solution might look something like this:
* You create a special address. Any BTC sent to the address can be spent by you at any time, but:
* Specified merchants are allowed to spend BTC sent to the address, but only a specific amount per month.
* You can add merchants to the address at any time without changing the address.
* You can remove merchants from the address at any time without changing the address.
I think that the second point would be possible if Bitcoin scripts could look at the transaction's values. This feature is planned, though probably far off. The third point could maybe be done if Bitcoin scripts allowed pubkey-verifying arbitrary data. This is in Elements, so maybe it could make it to Bitcoin. The fourth point would require something other than a single P2SH address.

Bonds would work well.
If you want to replicate deposit accounts in a more decentralized way, it occurs to me that maybe you could create a "debt network" that works something like this:
* A number of people who all trust each other absolutely get together to form a debt network. (Maybe there's some way of doing it with less-than-fully-trusted members.)
* When you deposit BTC into the debt network "account", you initially just mark this BTC as available. It doesn't leave you.
* Whenever possible, you lend up to 100% of the deposited BTC to a member of the network requesting a loan or to an external party borrowing from the network. The external borrowing policy probably needs to be uniform, which perhaps implies some sort of centralization.
* You collect partial-principal + interest payments from the borrower and reserve some of the interest to cover future defaults.
* Whenever you want to withdraw money from your "account", you borrow money from another member of the network and redirect an appropriate percentage of future payments on your earlier loan to that person.
* If an external loan defaults, the network pools its money to act as an insurer.

It's roughly the same in that respect, but bitaddress-type paper wallets are *very strongly not recommended* because you're using a single key all of the time and you have to manually import/export/transact with the key, which is very error-prone. Any time you're manually touching private keys, you're doing something very dangerous, and there's probably something wrong with your setup.
The hardware also allows you a secure shortcut to your BTC in the form of a PIN.
For the majority of people, writing the recovery seed down and putting it in a very safe place is the best option. Then you don't have to worry too much about forgetting the key, and it's kept totally safe from malware because it never touches a computer. But if you want, you could encrypt the seed first.

UASFs are good, but they take time: I'd ideally like to see a year between the release of UASF-enforcing software and activation (though maybe 6 or 9 months could be OK in some cases). If the UASF isn't going to ever be included in Core (which BIP148 isn't), then you might need even *longer* than a year in order to be somewhat safe. Therefore, I expect Aug 1 to be very underwhelming: We'll see some posts on about how BIP148ers now have stuck blockchains, and nothing else of significance.
Yes, it is unacceptable how things are now. Asicboost is a dangerous attack on mining, miners should never be able to block protocol enhancements, etc. But that doesn't mean that we need to panic and do *something, anything, regardless of how dangerous or unlikely to succeed it is*. Let's remain clear-headed, and do something that will actually *work* (ie. BIP149 or similar).
I find it especially annoying when people treat this as if it's some grassroots political campaign where we just need everyone to "get out and vote". *There is no voting in Bitcoin.* You can set up a million BIP148 nodes and it won't make any difference. For that matter, any individual person doesn't have much economic force, so I'm not sure that it'd make much difference even if you got 50% or 75% or 90% of users to personally hard-enforce BIP148. You need *significant economic actors*: Bitcoin-accepting businesses, exchanges, etc. Maybe it's *possible* to succeed in a UASF without much business support, but then you need *massive* end-user support, which requires default-on hard enforcement in common software like Core. You're never going to succeed with grassroots political tactics but ~no time, ~no business support, and ~no default-on support in common software.
(BTW, I differ from gmaxwell in that I don't think BIP91 will activate SegWit. I think that SegWit will ultimately have to be activated via a UASF.)

Order books aren't just abstract numbers on an exchange. If those orders exist, then it means that you can sell BCC for USD at those prices and then withdraw your USD. Eventually he's going to run out of USD. If the orders are completely fabricated and can't be executed, or if you're not allowed to actually withdraw your USD/BTC, then it'll be immediately obvious to everyone that the exchange is basically non-functional, and people will use other exchanges.

No, if BIP148 fails it will be because it was poorly-designed, as I and many others have been warning about since it was created. Doing a UASF in ~6 months is *really really pushing it* as-is, and on top of that BIP148 wasn't ever going to be included in Core (due to its high probability of failing), and people didn't start pushing it in earnest until a couple months ago. It never had more than a small chance of succeeding, and this chance has been shrinking as time has gone on and it hasn't grown in support nearly as quickly as would have been required.
I predict that SegWit will be activated by BIP149 in about a year. BIP149 is supported by ~all Core devs, unlike BIP148, so it will be included in Core, and it will have more time to gain inertia. Yes, it's extremely annoying that miners are holding up technical progress, but the sky isn't going to fall if we keep the status quo for a while longer.

I think that adding or removing a signer would be a hardfork of the Liquid network, but since there are only a few people using that network this isn't such a big deal.
If a signer disappears, the network can continue. If a signer is compromised, I think that the other signers can overrule them.
The model used by Liquid is probably the exact same thing used by Elements Alpha (in which blocks are signed by a handful of notable devs), so you can look at the Elements Alpha code to get more detailed info.

For those unfamiliar, what CSV does is allow you to use *relative lock times* in Bitcoin contracts. Examples:
* You could create an address (starting with 3) which can't spend BTC sent to it for some amount of time after the BTC was received. Previously, delays such as this could only be up to some specific point in time.
* You could have an address that is normally a 2-of-3 multisig address, but times out to some backup rule x days after it receives BTC.
* It's used for certain on-chain transactions needed by Lightning.

Miners don't matter that much in a hard fork. 
If miners don't upgrade but most of the economy does, then the miners that stay on the old fork will be mining worthless coins. If they try to attack the new network, then the new network will change its PoW algorithm to make their ASICs useless.
The main factor in whether a hard fork is "accepted" is whether users and businesses upgrade. And even then, you can still stay on the old fork if you want to. Bitcoin is not a democracy: the majority can't change the rules on you.

In Japanese, names with the same pronunciation can be spelled using different kanji, which gives them different meanings. That's the meaning for the most common spellings of Satoshi and Nakamoto, but our Satoshi never actually spelled his name using kanji, so we don't know the meaning.
[Examples of different spellings of Satoshi](
* 里 (village; sometimes used as shorthand for 理 = logic; I've proposed using this as the symbol for 0.00000001 BTC)
* 里史 (I think that 史 is a sort of meaningless suffix in this context, so same as above)
* 理史 (理 = logic, reason, justice)
* 哲 (sage, philosopher)
* 敏 (clever)
[Examples of different spellings of Nakamoto](
* 中元 / 中本 (central basis/origin)
* 沖本 (沖 = open sea?; 本 = basis)
* 中許 (中 = central; 許 = under influence)
(In reality, I suspect that Satoshi just chose two especially common Japanese names without knowing anything about their possible meanings.)

It's subjective, but should be pretty clear in most circumstances. People should be able to choose to continue using old nodes without being punished. (Note that not getting a new feature is not punishment.) If it's not clear, it'd have to be debated at the time.


Old nodes can't check new rules. I don't consider this to be denial of service. It's impossible to make old nodes not validate their original rules.

One big barrier against that is that Bitcoin Core will only make one outgoing connection per /16 IP subnet (x.y.\*.\*). So an attacker would need very many quite different IPs, which is expensive. (Not expensive enough to completely rule out, though. A large botnet could probably do it, for example.)

Compare these two designs:
* The drone understands Bitcoin transactions, block headers, Merkle trees, etc. The drone recognizes its current owner as the person who controls some specific satoshi, defined arbitrarily (there is no universal, objective way to follow a satoshi through multiple transactions). The owner submits commands to the drone by proving that he owns that satoshi, and then signing the commands. When the original owner of the drone wants to rent it out, he publishes a transaction with a complex contract (maybe too complex for today's Bitcoin) designed to temporarily transfer ownership of this satoshi to someone else, who can submit commands in the same way.
* The drone just keeps track of who its owner is by storing a public key, and will accept commands signed by that key, including commands to transfer ownership to a different public key, temporarily or permanently.
Why would anyone choose the first design, which is far more complicated and expensive? (You might be tempted if you're trying to set up a DAO sort of thing, but in that case you should just give the drone the same rules as the DAO contract, which will be enforced independently by the drone rather than by the decentralized block chain.)
What people usually *really* need when they say they want to use a block chain is just normal *cryptography*. The terms "smart contracts" and "smart property" predate Bitcoin by over a decade -- they don't require a block chain.

Yes, if blocks were required to include the root hash of a standardized tree of *all* UTXOs. Then you'd download all block headers to find the longest chain, download the oldest full block that is still available, and work from its UTXO tree. Unless an attacker has had a lot of mining power for a very long time, you should be dealing with a correct view of the network, and you won't be able to be tricked in the future. But if an attacker *does* control the network for a very long time and does something rule-breaking, the network will split into "old full nodes and old miners" vs "new full nodes and the attacker", which would be problematic. One thing that could possibly fix this is to have some way for old nodes to use their better knowledge of network history to create and broadcast cryptographic proof that the longest chain is invalid; other full nodes would then know to abandon that chain.
It's very possible that Bitcoin will eventually be modified so that extremely old blocks can be completely forgotten. But probably not for several years. UTXO trees might be added more quickly, though.

I'm not so sure that the subsidy is *entirely* a negative externality, since miners are helping to keep Bitcoin secure, which is good for everyone holding BTC.

@_date: 2016-07-01 16:33:26
This rumor originated from a proposal by a random person on a Chinese forum. desperate as they are, interpreted the broken Google autotranslation of this post as "Chinese miners unanimously announce hardfork" instead of "Random forum user nobody's ever heard of proposes hardfork." Anyone who did even the smallest amount of research would have realized this, but cryptocoinnews is a rag, and the author of this article, aquentin, is a notorious troll with no interest in actual facts.
Miners can't do hardforks. If they could, then we'd all be trusting miners not to create more than 21 million BTC, not to steal BTC, etc. If there was any way at all that miners could do these things while not *completely* destroying BTC's value, then they would absolutely be incentivized to do so. For example, if Bitcoin was actually ruled by miners, then miners would jump at the chance to confiscate "stolen" BTC, since this is a theft that they could somewhat justify. This would be a terrible system, far worse than the traditional monetary system. When I see people trying to appeal to miners as if they were kings, I think, "Do you even realize what you're doing? If this was actually how it worked, why would Bitcoin have any value?"
Fortunately, Bitcoin does *not* work like this. Even if *every* miner agrees to hardfork, all full nodes will just ignore their blocks. As long as a ~majority of the Bitcoin *economy* is backed by independent full nodes, this ensures that miners can't change Bitcoin's hard rules. (BTW, this is one of the main reasons why it's important to keep the max block size reasonably small: if the economy isn't backed by independent full nodes, then Bitcoin is insecure and worthless, so it's important to not make running a full node so expensive that it pushes people away from running one.)
I've always kind of hoped that the XT/Classic forks would get their 75% so that we could watch whichever miners were stupid enough to sign onto it fall on their faces. They'd be back on the real chain moments after realizing that nobody would accept their mined coins.

Bitcoin introduces an additional layer of identity on top of the Internet. Trying to use Tor to anonymize your Bitcoin transactions is like going to a Web forum and, *using the same forum account*, posting your home address in one post and an offer to sell drugs in another. Tor isn't going to help you.
Example: Let's say you always use Tor for everything. You post pictures on where you want to be anonymous, and you also have an account on Coinbase. You receive a donation on GirlsGoneBitcoin to your address A. You send these bitcoins to Coinbase. Coinbase knows that these bitcoins came from address A because all Bitcoin transactions are public. They Google address A and find your GirlsGoneBitcoin photos. Your anonymity has been compromised even though you're behind Tor.
There are various mixing services that will frustrate at least casual block chain analysis, but it's not so clear that they would stand up to serious investigation. They all have patterns which can be identified and maybe used to link your input to the mixer with your output from the mixer.

Yeah, one could accurately say that people who fell for this weren't paranoid enough, but few people are. Falling for something like this is very understandable.
It's really a shame, since Electrum is often the first to add innovative new features that users actually need/want. But I suppose the quick development which allows for this also allows these sorts of embarrassing bugs to sneak in.
I often recommend Electrum, since I think that among lightweight wallets it has by far the best combination of end-user experience and features, but I may have to reconsider after these bugs. It's also one of the worst privacy-wise. I'm not sure what I'd recommend instead, though...
Maybe it'd be reasonable for Electrum to use Tor-style directory authorities by default instead of trusting totally random servers. That'd limit the impact of similar bugs, and also address some of the privacy/DoS issues.

If my full node sees an invalid block and ignores it, then what's essentially happening is that the network is splitting: me on one side and the miners on another. These become two completely separate currencies. If it's just me who's separating from the majority of miners, then it doesn't matter much. But if it's me and a few thousand other active Bitcoiners, exchanges, and businesses, then we have a situation in which the currency I'm using has an economy far stronger than the currency that miners are using. This *does* matter, and in fact economic acceptance is the *only* thing that matters here. BTC doesn't have value because there are so many petahashes behind it: it has value because there are a lot of people out there who believe it has value and will accept it.
A lot of this stuff wasn't known during Satoshi's time. Especially at the time of the whitepaper, which was published before Bitcoin was even released. Satoshi didn't talk much about non-miner full nodes because at this time everyone who mined ran their own full node, many people who ran a full node mined, and there wasn't any way to use Bitcoin *without* running a full node. However, [here]( a quote which shows that he recognized Bitcoin users (running full nodes) as being more powerful than miners:

You are extremely ill-informed. Those Lightning transactions which are not written to the block chain are constructed such that fraud is nearly impossible. If the sender tries anything, the recipient can easily detect this and close the channel without any loss.

See the post I just made here: 


It's different because the appropriate thing for a node to do when miners are producing invalid blocks or 51% attacking is to drop everything and wait for the node's operator to figure things out. Lightweight nodes will instead blindly follow the longest chain, which works most of the time, but can lead to accepting invalid blocks/transactions.
I'm not arguing that nobody should ever use a lightweight wallet. They're OK for occasional transactions of reasonably small value. But there is a security trade-off, and they certainly should *never* be used for automatic transaction processing.

The paper was written 8 years ago. It is still important, but it is *not* the best resource for newbies to learn about Bitcoin. One of the most common points of confusion is that at the time of the paper, the terms "miner" and "full node" hadn't even been invented yet; Satoshi considered nodes and miners to be more-or-less the same thing. He hadn't considered pooled mining, and although he might've recognized that it was unsustainable long-term, the picture he had in his mind at the time of the paper was of widespread CPU mining by individuals. Therefore, whenever you see Satoshi use the word "node" in the paper and in his forum posts, you have to determine from context whether he's referring to full nodes, lightweight nodes, miners, or some combination of these. For example, take a look at this important part of the paper and my annotated modern terminology:


I recommend that newbies read bitcoin.org and bitcoin.it to understand Bitcoin, and only afterward take a look at the paper for a more historical perspective.

The fee market is a separate issue from resource usage. I think that most experts are far more concerned about having enough of the economy backed by full nodes than keeping fees sufficiently high. Personally, I pretty much ignore the miner reward issue because I think that the subsidy will be sufficient for 4-8 more years, and after that it seems possible that the market will figure out some way of incentivizing enough security (eg. assurance contracts).
Auto-adjustment is a good eventual goal (and it's mentioned in the Core roadmap), but it has more issues than are obvious. For example:
* Increasing the max non-witness size per block also increases the maximum amount that a block can increase the size of the UTXO set, which even *pruned* nodes need to store. (I'm aware of one good solution for this, but it's very complicated. And then there's the kludgy solution of placing an arbitrary limit on how much each block can grow the UTXO set on net.)
* Validation is currently O(n^2 ), so just setting MAX_BLOCK_SIZE=2MB could result in a block that takes 10 minutes to verify without other changes. (SegWit mostly fixes this.)
* Although basically everyone on the network can easily *download* a few MB very quickly, upload bandwidth tends to be a lot more limited. If the network "runs out" of upload bandwidth, latency will increase a lot, which can cause the network to fail to converge on a single chain for long periods of time. (Compact blocks will improve this by allowing block transmission to be more spread-out in time, but this'll probably be the main limiting factor long-term.)
* In automatic adjustment, how do you both eliminate "central economic planning" and make it impossible for block sizes to become very unreasonable?
Also, a lot of people point to Nielsen's Law for the long-term increase schedule, but that's literally just one guy's random guess, not backed by any science. The growth rate of BIP 103 seems more reasonable to me, though perhaps the starting point could be moved up by a few MB if some of the planned scaling improvements are completed by that time.


This possibility is in the Core roadmap.

Being overpowered by an attacker can be a temporary condition. An attacker with even 10% of the network can generate 6 blocks in a row with reasonably high probability. You only need to have 51% to *guarantee* control long-term.
In case of a real 51% attack, Bitcoin Core will enter safe mode (ie. basically shut down) if it observes a long invalid chain, and in some cases it will stop working after a very long reorg. After that, the appropriate response is to immediately change the PoW.  Lightweight nodes can't alert about invalid chains because they can't know which chain is invalid, and they will blindly follow the wrong chain in a PoW change scenario.

* Due to the above point, blockchain.info knows everything about your wallet, a major privacy issue.

IMO the required amount of consensus won't be possible unless/until miners actually execute some sort of attack. But it's good to have the conversation now. We should be ready to hardfork at a moment's notice, as soon as miners cross the line.
The problem with regularly hardforking to a different PoW whenever mining becomes too centralized (also suggested by Luke and others) is that it creates a period of time in which Bitcoin is more vulnerable to attack, and it creates a point of centralization in which *some* decision will have to be made about what the new PoW will be -- a decision which will very often choose winners and losers. In the case of an ongoing attack by miners, this can't be avoided: it's a choice between dealing with a PoW change, which is sub-optimal but survivable, and accepting miner tyranny, which is not survivable. But I don't think that it's good to *aim* for regular PoW changes. It'd be nice to find one PoW algorithm (or maybe a hybrid PoW1+PoW2+PoS, as I've suggested before) that will work indefinitely. [Cuckoo]( has been suggested as a PoW algorithm which might be ASIC-resistant.
Edit: Random thought: As long as the current PoW is maintained as a *component* of some future hybrid PoW, I think that it's possible to do the PoW change as a softfork. Though miners are unlikely to willingly adopt this, so it'd have to be done through the hardfork-like process, and probably the advantages of a hardfork-like-softfork vs a real hardfork are not worth the extra trouble in this case.

Maybe you could combine this technique with Tor so that you pick a few RIFFLE servers from a large group of volunteer relays. Each relay would only be handing a couple hundred clients. Assuming that it's "1+ honest server = perfect anonymity" (I didn't look into it), then this is an improvement on Tor, where the first and last node can conspire to identify you using timing information even if the middle node is honest.
Tor's network is centrally managed by the directory authorities, so they could do a lot of complex things to make it work. They could separate relays into groups of 3 which must always be used together, for example.

Agreed, it's a reasonable trade-off in some cases. Especially if you're not accepting payments automatically, it's often fine.

Quantum computers would have a massive *per-operation* advantage in mining. If a quantum computer could do the same number of quantum operations per second as a classical computer could do classical operations, and the classical computer could do *x* Bitcoin hashes per second, then the quantum computer could do on the order of *x^2* hashes per second.
But it's not going to be a factor anytime soon. QC is like computers of ~100 years ago: Currently we're at the stage of "what the hell am I supposed to do with these tube things?" Perhaps in a few decades quantum computers will take up a whole floor of a building and be able to do a handful of operations per second, and still be useless for mining. Maybe someday they'll be fast enough that even though they can do far fewer operations per second compared to classical Bitcoin miners, they can compete due to their quantum advantage. In this case, all Bitcoin miners would soon become quantum miners, which isn't a problem as long as you're not invested in non-quantum mining equipment.

This post is about Bitcoin.


Hardforks are very difficult because of the way full nodes work, as I mentioned.
The idea that Satoshi intended miners to be rulers of the network is clearly contradicted by the following paragraph from the SPV section of the paper (and in many places elsewhere):


Satoshi's design for Bitcoin was that most people (certainly most merchants) would run full nodes, and full nodes would enforce the rules no matter what, regardless of miner support. If he had intended miners to make all decisions, then the SPV section of the paper would just say, "Miners are rulers of the network, so there's no need for alerts (fraud proofs) or anything -- just trust miners." This is even more obvious if you look at all of his posts as a whole; he clearly intended Bitcoin to be tamper-resistant, as I described in my post. For example:

In Bitcoin Core, go to Help -&gt; Debug window -&gt; Console tab. If you set a passphrase, type `walletpassphrase INSERT_PASSPHRASE_HERE 300`. Then type `dumpprivkey INSERT_ADDRESS_HERE`. It'll output the private key of the address in the standard wallet import format (WIF). You can give this to pretty much any wallet and it'll be able to spend the BTC.
This is considered a low-level debug feature. End-users are not supposed to be messing with individual keys -- it can confuse your wallet(s), and it's easy to make mistakes that lose BTC. I think in this particular case it's reasonably safe, but in the future you should avoid it.
(There's a way of transferring the BTC before the syncing is done without messing with individual private keys, using the `createrawtransaction` command, but it's a lot more complicated.)

After the subsidy is 1 satoshi, it goes down to 0 forever. There are no fractional satoshi.
The number 64 is in the code because the halving is done as `nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings` ("set nSubsidy to nSubsidy shifted right by halvings bits"), but the C++ standard says of the &gt;&gt; operator:


nSubsidy is always exactly 64 bits in size (this is guaranteed elsewhere in the code), so if halvings is 64 or greater, then `nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings` becomes absolutely meaningless. And in fact, on all typical compilers and machines, what actually happens is that the right-hand operator is taken mod 64. So `x &gt;&gt;= 64` equals `x &gt;&gt;= 0`. That's why the `if (halvings &gt;= 64) return 0;` case is needed.

I don't store any significant bitcoins in a Bitcoin bank. Bitcoin is all about *being your own bank*. You can download wallet software and put your bitcoins there, and then no bank can ever tell you what you can or cannot do with those bitcoins.

UPnP tells your router or firewall to forward port 8333 automatically so you can receive incoming connections. It only sometimes works, though, depending on your network setup. It's even possible (though rare) for your network to be setup such that you can receive incoming connections even without UPnP or any manual port forwarding, so disabling UPnP is not a fool-proof way of *preventing* incoming connections.

Chapter 9 is for municipalities. States can't use chapter 9 themselves, so that change in definition doesn't seem to matter here.
States and the federal government are sovereign states. They can use their sovereignty to change the law of the land such that their debt no longer exists. Therefore, they have no need for bankruptcy protection. Puerto Rico is not a sovereign state, but a property of the US federal government. It can't change its laws to wipe away the debt like a state could (without federal approval), but none of the bankruptcy chapters really apply to it. So it's in sort of a limbo situation legally, which is why the US congress has been working on setting up something to handle this case.

It's possible to have an interest-paying Bitcoin deposit account which practices fractional reserve, loaning out 90% or whatever of its deposits and relying on the fact that a bank run is very unlikely. This would increase Bitcoin's M1 money supply. But if there is a bank run, they actually won't be able to pay since nobody can create more BTC for them, and if too many loans default then people will lose some of their deposit. This sort of account isn't inherently bad as long as depositors know what they're getting into, though AFAIK all such accounts have historically been scams.

Entire states in Mexico are controlled by criminal organizations, and the Mexican federal government is fairly weak, so the thought has occurred to me whether it'd be possible to pay one of the more "loose" states an annual fee to protect a free city within its borders. (It'd be a legal contract, not a bribe, but with one of the states known to be more profit-oriented.) Or maybe a seastead or island off the coast. You'd probably have to agree to at least a few concessions to keep the Mexican federal government off your back, like no harboring of terrorists or rebels.
I actually don't think that it'd be all that difficult to find investors for this endeavor, since you'd be creating a free city like Hong Kong or Dubai, which are immensely profitable. But to attract investors (and then to actually succeed), you'd need a team of excellent and trustworthy negotiators who are very familiar with the Mexican government(s).
This is probably possible in other countries as well, but Mexico comes to mind as a good one because of its fairly stable but also possibly friendly governmental situation and its good location (close to the US).
I've been passionate about the idea of creating politically separate colonies since I read *Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps*, one of the first books to propose seasteads (though the author didn't call them that), when I was 10 or so. But sadly, it seems basically impossible to get totally outside of the reach of governments while remaining on Earth. If space travel and large free-floating self-sufficient space habitats ever become reasonably practical, then that'll make things a lot easier because there's just *so much* space.

You can't upgrade a pre-existing wallet. You'd have to do something like:
* Backup your wallet.dat.
* Upgrade Bitcoin Core.
* Shut it down.
* Rename wallet.dat to wallet.old.
* Start Bitcoin Core -- it'll create a new wallet.dat which will be an HD wallet.
* Generate several addresses in the new HD wallet.
* Shut down Bitcoin Core.
* Backup wallet.dat again, such that you have both wallet.dat files backed up.
* Rename wallet.dat to wallet.new and wallet.old to wallet.dat again.
* Open Bitcoin Core and send all of your BTC to your new addresses. Note that sending all of your BTC at once is very bad for anonymity because it will probably link together all of your addresses, due to both shared inputs and the transactions' closeness in time. For more anonymity, you should do the transactions slowly over time, transferring only a few "coins" at a time (use Bitcoin Core's coin control feature), and always to a new address in the HD wallet.
* Whenever you switch from one wallet.dat to another, you need to run Bitcoin Core with the `-rescan` switch one time for it to see all of the new transactions. And you can't enable pruning.

* Acute failure caused by lack of true scalability: The software is untested with larger blocks. Prior to version 0.8, even though the hard limit was 1MB, in practice nodes would often fail to process such large blocks. (Failure was random, not based on a certain block size.) This lead to an "accidental hardfork" when 0.8 was released, because 0.8 would produce and accept blocks that some older nodes would randomly reject. Today, due to O(n^2 ) verification time, it's possible to construct a block that takes 30 seconds to verify; this would go up to *10 minutes of verification* with 2 MB (non-SegWit) blocks.
* Acute failure caused by latency: Even ignoring the above verification issue, the long time required to download/upload/verify large blocks can cause so much latency that mining outside of one centralized location becomes impractical. Furthermore, extreme latency can cause the network to take a very long time to converge on a single chain -- you could frequently have a situation in which half the network is a few blocks different from another.
* Chronic failure caused by lack of decentralization: See my post [here]( (Also, if you go through my posts from 3-6 months ago, I talked about this stuff all the time, in great detail.)

If you search, I have explained this many times...
About $70k was donated, mostly in 2011-2013. This was spent on building [Epochtalk]( It's essentially complete, and you can run it on your own server if you want to check it out. It works just fine, and most people are impressed with the look and speed. But I'm not ready to transition bitcointalk.org to it yet for a variety of reasons, such as:
* The current software, while ugly, performs well, especially since I have extensively modified the backend to add features and improve performance. So there's no huge drive to move away from it.
* I am the only bitcointalk.org sysadmin and on-demand programmer, and I'm used to the current software.
* There hasn't been enough testing. I think that immediately after transition, a variety of small missed features, bugs, and performance issues would crop up. As a result, I'd expect the post-transition user experience to be poor for months while these things are fixed, which I don't want.
* The data-transition procedure, while *largely* complete, still has known minor bugs.
However, we continue to work on these issues. The software is not vaporware (it's long existed in a runnable state, and is currently basically feature-complete), and is not abandoned (look at the git commit log). If anyone is unhappy with the progress, I invite them to take the epochtalk code and create a competing forum with it; since they won't have to worry about the transition issues, they'd have a much easier time, and their testing will also end up helping me.
The forum still has some BTC in reserve, but this is from ad/fee revenue, not donations. Note that **all revenue from any source** is accumulated in the public donation address. Someone has not been donating tens of thousands of dollars every month for years: that's me consolidating ad/fee revenue. These remaining funds will be used to keep the forum operational, invest further in the forum in various ways, and perhaps invest in the wider Bitcoin ecosystem. I'm not going to donate it to unrelated things like the Pineapple Fund did, though.

The US defaulted on its precious-metal backing for the dollar several times in the past, so you wouldn't be able to treat USD as being "as good as gold" or anything. It would signal an absolutely shocking change in economic policy, though. It's difficult to imagine.
I think that it would not obviously/immediately affect the demand for BTC. Gold backing mainly has to do with inflation, but if you're really worried about inflation but are fine with USD otherwise, then you can just buy TIPS or similar. This change would not affect the fact that USD:
* Is more-or-less required to be held in accounts where the USD can be confiscated at any time by the US, mismanaged by third-parties in various ways, and where privacy is impossible.
* Cannot be moved to anyone frictionlessly, as was most recently demonstrated in the Paypal/Subscribestar thing, though this happens *all the time*, and not just with Paypal.
* Inherently trusts the US government.
There may be secondary effects related to the overall economy, though. Gold backing would probably increase interest rates, strengthen and stabilize the fiat economy, and reduce the ability of the US government to endlessly expand its debt. These factors might make BTC less attractive in several ways. But it's difficult to predict.
BTW, I wrote about how governments might theoretically compete more directly with BTC [here](

Don't do that kind of paper wallet, it's far too error-prone.
Instead, buy a hardware wallet. During the hardware wallet setup procedure, it will give you a seed composed of ~12 random words.

Bitcoin hasn't existed during a recession, so it's unclear. I created a [poll on bitcointalk.org about it]( a couple of months ago, and the current results have 57% of people thinking that BTC will go up in a recession. I tend to agree more with you, though; people who put money into BTC merely as a way to generate returns will probably be inclined to move back to traditional investments during a recession. (Maybe this is already happening, and is partly the cause of the current downturn.) Though because a large percentage of Bitcoin users are unwilling or unable to do that, I think that it will only be a moderate downward pressure, which might be overcome depending on the circumstances. For example, if the recession coincides with the usual post-halvening BTC boom, then maybe the two factors will largely cancel each other out.
Also, if the recession gets so bad that people start to lose faith in the fiat economy entirely rather than just treating it as an annoying temporary thing, then that'd probably be very good for BTC.

Operating systems collect entropy slowly over time from the keyboard, network devices, etc. and then when they shut down they save the collected entropy to a file. So over time, the entropy builds up. But when you start a liveCD, the entropy will start out the same as for everyone else who runs that liveCD -- random numbers generated right after booting will always be the same. Under certain hardware configurations, it's possible that the entropy gets updated very slowly or in very predictable ways, and there isn't enough *real, unique* entropy by the time you generate Bitcoin keys.
There's an interesting experiment you can try to see this first-hand. On something like VirtualBox, make a snapshot of an OS while it's in the middle of doing nothing. Then restore the snapshot and immediately (within a few seconds) get random data from /dev/random. Repeat. The random data will usually be exactly the same. (A liveCD is like a VM snapshot.)

This is true.


I completely addressed this argument in my posts above.
If you believe this, then why don't you just find 6-12 trustworthy people to run a currency for you? What's the point of all the mining and verification nonsense? If you believe that Bitcoin is in reality 100% controlled by miners, then the actual mining doesn't actually provide anything except for a particularly inefficient and sub-optimal way to identify Bitcoin's rulers. It'd be better to find people who you *know* are trustworthy and just have them multisig-sign transactions rather than mining anything.

That can't happen, they're mutually incompatible. Even if the ETC chain becomes longer, ETH will remain separate.
The main concern is that ETC will survive long-term with a high value, and Coinbase will be forced to return the ETC that people deposited post-fork, which they've apparently been giving away. In that case, Coinbase could stand to lose a lot of money, maybe more than they can afford. If they're forced to return the actual ETC rather than the USD value at the time of the deposit, then the possible loss is theoretically unlimited (like writing a naked call option).

Single-key paper wallets are strongly discouraged. Writing an Electrum (or whatever) mnemonic onto paper is better, but I recommend a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or KeepKey. Use the device itself for transactions, and put the backup mnemonic (which it'll give you) in a safe deposit box.

A majority of miners can censor whichever transactions they want -- that's a known limitation of the way Bitcoin works, and a big reason to be concerned about miner centralization. They can do it just because they don't like the sender, or because the Chinese government orders it, or in an attempt to push old nodes into a hardfork (as in "generalized soft-forks"). In any case, if a majority of miners are behaving inappropriately, then the PoW must be changed.
Anything that significantly denies service to old nodes should be considered equivalent to a hardfork vis-à-vis the amount of agreement required to legitimately move forward with it. Without the required agreement, it's an attack by miners.

And it is unprofessional and disrespectful to imply that someone is *actually* a gender other than the one they clearly intend to be. For example, I'm sure that if Satoshi instead chose the name "Satori Nakamoto", a few people would refuse to use feminine pronouns because "there are no women on the Internet lol", and this behavior would rightly be viewed as very childish.

Yes, definitely. In situations where Bitcoin will split into two parts that both have not-insignificant economic support (ie. hardforks and some UASFs with significant-but-not-unanimous economic support), if you hold BTC in your local wallet and avoid transacting around the time of the fork, then after the fork you will be able to split the BTC into BTC and "BTC-X", two separate currencies. (Though you'll probably need extra software in order to effect this split.) A Bitcoin bank on the other hand may, through either greed/malice or technical incompetence, steal or lose one of the post-fork currencies, maybe even the only one with any long-term value.
You shouldn't store any more BTC in a Bitcoin bank than you need to *in general*, though. If you don't control the private keys, it's not really your BTC. These banks may *look* safe, but that's what everyone thought about MtGox...

That transaction is paying 30 sat/B. According to my bitcoind's estimatefee, that'll take about 4 blocks to confirm. About 0.2% of the time (ie. more than once per week on average), it takes the network more than two hours to mine 4 blocks.
Block-chain-based transactions are *never* suitable for reliably quick transactions.  Even if you had paid an enormous fee, there's a 5% chance that it would've taken 30 minutes, a 1% chance that it would've taken 46 minutes, and even longer waits are not all that uncommon.
For quick payments we need something off-chain. For example, Lightning will allow for instant, cheap transactions because it doesn't usually involve the block chain.

If you will be ruined if the money disappears, then you probably shouldn't put it into BTC at all, regardless of the price. Too risky.
Throughout all of Bitcoin's history I am notorious for being pretty much constantly bearish on shorter-term prices, even if I'm bullish long-term. With that in mind, $2k seems unnaturally high to me, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if it eventually drops to $1250-$1500, or possibly even lower. I wouldn't start to think that prices are unnaturally *low* unless it drops below about $700. It is far more reasonable to enter the market at $2000 rather than jumping headlong onto a panic-buy train very near the all-time-high, though.
I don't particularly recommend day-trading or trying to time the market, though. Dollar-cost-averaging and then holding is good IMO.

It increases bandwidth and archival-node storage requirements exactly the same as a ~2MB naïve hardfork would. There's widespread agreement that this level of increase is safe for the system as a whole, though it may in fact be an annoyance to some people.
But SegWit does not significantly increase the number of net UTXOs that can be created per block, while a ~2MB naïve hardfork would do so. The total number of UTXOs is one of the main verification-speed bottlenecks, and it also increases the storage required by pruning nodes.

Yeah, but it seems to me nearly impossible for new software to be so widely deployed in such a short amount of time, even if the change was uncontroversial (which certainly isn't the case here). Even if they got a few of the major exchanges, that'd be far from an economic majority -- the Bitcoin economy goes much deeper than just the big sites visible at the surface.
This difficulty of deployment is why I've been somewhat opposed to BIP148 and I predict that it will fail, even though I agree with the underlying change of BIP148. "Segwit2x" has even worse deployment problems plus an underlying change that is garbage.

More-or-less. Bitcoin-Script can simulate any logic gate; see my [3-bit gate-oriented adder in Script]( So you can for example perform any mathematical operation with whatever pre-defined precision you want. If you want to calculate 1 billion digits of pi, Script can do it (ignoring actual transaction size limits). But due to the lack of looping, Script programs that need to run a long time will have to be proportionally large; the billion-digit pi Script would need several billion opcodes.
This is an intentional design decision. Making Script more useful for general computation is trivial, and could even be done in a softfork. The OP_EVAL softfork proposal from 2011, intended to provide similar features to the now-live P2SH feature, was withdrawn mainly because it *accidentally* made loops possible within Script. Allowing loops creates a number of issues, and there are very few (no?) use-cases where *this* actually prevents you from doing something that you want to do. If you're unable to do something in Bitcoin-Script, 90% of the time it's because you're not trying hard enough, and 10% of the time it's because Script limits your *access to information*, also for security reasons (eg. you can't figure out any information about your transaction's block from Script). Limitations on input/output are unrelated to Turing-completeness.

I've long thought that it'd be an interesting project to get a full node working on shared hosting. It could be written in PHP natively, though it's extremely difficult to write a 100%-compatible full node from scratch. (It's fairly easy to write PHP that merely speaks the Bitcoin protocol -- you could use this to communicate with a trusted full node, though in that case you also need to set up an authenticated communications channel.) Another idea would be to write a virtual machine in PHP that is capable of running in `max_execution_time` increments and then calling itself again or something, and give it Bitcoin Core binaries to run.

Bitcoin fees are a bit non-intuitive. They're not based on the BTC amount of the transaction -- it's entirely possible for a 0.01 BTC transaction to require a higher fee than a 1000 BTC transaction.
Basic intro to how Bitcoin transactions work: If you receive BTC in three separate transactions of (say) 1, 5, and 10 BTC, then you can think of your wallet as containing three gold coins with sizes 1, 5, and 10 BTC. If you then want to send 6 BTC, you can melt the 1 &amp; 5 BTC coins together and recast them as a 6 BTC coin, or melt the 10 BTC coin and recast a 6 BTC coin for the recipient and a 4 BTC coin as change for yourself. In Bitcoin's technical vocabulary, these objects are literally called input and output coins. (Below, when I say "coin" I mean these objects, not the amount of BTC value.)
Transaction fees are proportional to the **number** (not value) of input and output coins in a transaction. Input coins are about 5x more expensive than output coins.
So, assuming blockchain.info (a notoriously unreliable service) isn't just once again failing, the reason your fee is so high in this case is that your wallet is full of a whole bunch of tiny coins, so your transaction will need to take very many coins as inputs, increasing the cost. On the bright side, fees will go down once you make a few transactions, since you will end up "melting down" these many small coins into a few larger ones.
So if you have like 1000 tiny faucet payments totaling 0.5 BTC and then 16.5 BTC from other sources, then you'll find that sending ~16.5 BTC will be massively cheaper than sending a slightly higher value since it avoids including all of those faucet coins

Electrum also consumes random data to create the HD wallet root keys. Also, some wallets require that you have good random numbers whenever you send BTC or sign messages -- due to the way ECDSA works, if you accidentally use the same random number twice while signing with the same key, then anyone on the network can calculate its private key. (Some wallets generate this "random" number by hashing the message, which is safer, though I don't know off-hand which wallets do this.)
It's not a terrible idea to use a liveCD, since it reduces the risk of malware. But it's probably a good idea to add extra entropy to the RNG right away. You can do so like this, as root:
    cat &gt; /dev/urandom &lt;&lt; 'EOF'
    Type a bunch of random data here, maybe
    typing random keys and rolling some dice or something,
    and then end with EOF on its own line.
    asdfghkl;
    123456
    EOF
And then wait a couple of minutes after that to make extra sure that the RNG pool has actually been updated.
Even better would be to use a hardware wallet like a Trezor or KeepKey. I think that dedicated hardware devices are really the way forward for Bitcoin.

Probably it's not that common because txids are usually expressed in hexadecimal, which seriously limits the possible messages.


That makes me a little uneasy, since k must be random. I suppose incrementing a random k for a while should be OK, though it seems very dangerous if you derive k from a hash.
After SegWit, this will probably be easier because the txid won't include the signature.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:02:31
In most contexts, but if you hash the same message twice, you get the same "random" k. I could imagine this causing k reuse in rare circumstances here. Like maybe if it increments from a hash-derived value several times using different patterns, and prints candidate transactions to a file, which the user doesn't know to treat as equivalent to his private key. Kind of a contrived example, but it just seems unsafe.

Bitcoin also has no intrinsic value. For that matter, most of gold's price comes from its use as a store of value. If for some reason everyone decided that gold was both ugly and no good as a store of value, then the "intrinsic value" that it'd return to would be *far* less -- only its value in industry, etc.
I don't think that intrinsic value is a useful concept in money. As Satoshi said, "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work." Probably the  reason reason that both gold and Bitcoin are better than paper money that you don't have to trust some central bank not to screw with your money. But if God came down and gave us perfectly-trustworthy paper money with predictable, modest monetary inflation or deflation, then that would work just fine.

The majority of miners *can be wrong*, either accidentally or due to malicious miners. From the whitepaper section on SPV:


@_date: 2017-06-10 02:50:54


Yes, there's basically unlimited demand for cheap block-chain space. If there was no max block size and miners weren't able to collude to keep fees somewhat high, then people would start storing data on the block chain, doing high-frequency microtransactions, etc. (If mining was decentralized, then it wouldn't be possible for them to collude, and fees would tend toward zero if there was no max block size. But mining is very centralized, so maybe they would be able to collude on fees...)
That doesn't mean that it's not worthwhile to increase the max block size where safely possible, though, since it does reduce fees, and all else being equal, lower fees are better. Although the demand for near-free block-chain space is basically unlimited, demand for space at higher prices is not. Imagine an order depth graph ([like this]( Mining is like transaction-senders putting bids on the left side at various prices (in sat/B) and sizes (in B), and someone gets 1 million B with which to take the highest bids every 10 minutes on average. If you extended it to zero sat/B on the left side, the demand (ie. total size of bids) would go to ~infinity. Even slightly above zero, the demand is massive. But when you get to more reasonable levels, demand is more limited. If you change the game so that someone gets 2 million B with which to take bids every 10 minutes, then you go deeper left on the order depth graph (ie. fees get lower), but *pricewise*-demand is still limited.
So what happens when the max block size is increased to 2MB via SegWit (or hypothetically a hardfork)? Fees get lower by an unpredictable amount. If the average feerate is 200 sat/B now, then the entire economy has to start spending 200 sat/B \* 2 million B = 4 BTC per block in fees rather than 200 sat/B \* 1 million B = 2 BTC per block in fees to keep the feerate the same after the increase. It can happen, but that requires increasing demand.

Random-access disk speed is one of the main bottlenecks in full-node speed. For every transaction in a block, you have to lookup the outputs being spent in order to verify the transaction, delete the old outputs from the main chainstate database, put a copy into the rewind database (in case the block is later orphaned), and create entries for new outputs in the chainstate database. The whole block is also written to disk for a while, and too-old blocks are deleted.
23GB written and 480 GB read in 5 hours does seems rather high to me, but I don't know enough about the low-level details to say that this is indicative of a problem.
Increasing the dbcache setting will help a lot. `dbcache=500` will give Core 500 MB of RAM to cache database stuff, for example. You could also try:

Moving to a model where blocks are allowed to contain invalid+ignored transactions would be technically very complex. There aren't even any altcoins that work like that. So it wouldn't be possible to write the code for it before the BIP148 deadline, much less get agreement on such a major change.
Also, since Bitcoin has always worked under the idea that blocks should contain only valid transactions, I suspect that this will never be changed in Bitcoin, even though I do think that there is some merit to the alternative.

Primarily, it's just that `freedom + size = mess`, and with bitcointalk.org I've chosen to keep freedom about as high as possible, for example allowing paid signature ads, poor English, micro-earning services which often attract a spammy crowd, etc. Banning these things (and other noise-generating factors) would be easily possible, and would immediately lead to a cleaner environment, but it'd also be a less free environment. IMO there are enough highly-controlled platforms around, and I'd prefer to try maximizing the freedom axis. (Maximizing freedom on the forum was a policy started by Satoshi when he was an admin, BTW, though it was years after he left before the forum became large enough for freedom to actually come in conflict with signal much.)
Bitcointalk.org is under active development on two parallel paths:
 * First, although the *outward appearance* hasn't changed much at all since 2010, I have made tons of changes to the code, including many features. About a year ago for example I added the Merit system, which has improved signal-to-noise quite a bit, by means of changing incentives.
 * Second, a completely new software platform has long been in development. This software is open source, **can be run now**, and an instance of it is available for example at  . But I don't think that it's quite complete enough to migrate bitcointalk.org to it yet.
 
On both development paths, we try to tackle signal-vs-noise by methods such as categorizing posts better, improving incentives, trying to create smaller sub-communities, etc., but **not** via restriction, if at all possible.
While I don't claim to have nearly maximized the signal-to-noise which might be possible even given a high degree of freedom, bitcointalk.org is pretty anarchic, and it will always be so. (Though note that some sections are much better than others.) If that doesn't appeal to you, then you should use a different site. Smaller communities, like IRC channels and similar, can be both free and have a high signal-to-noise ratio. This was bitcointalk.org in 2010-2013, but it's now too large. You can also have large communities that are more strictly moderated, like @_date: 2013-02-10 01:50:46

A direct transfer between Bitcoin and a sidechain will be slow (a couple days, maybe?) and have high fees due to the very large transaction size, so probably people will more often trade between the different BTC-pegged currencies (and BTC itself) on a market. But because the fixed peg still exists, the spread between the pegged value and the market value should be pretty small. There's [a way to trustlessly trade between chains]( which will be useful here.
In the sidechain system that's likely to actually be implemented, you can't do a direct transfer from one sidechain to another. It has to go through BTC first. A market trade can be done between two sidechain currencies, however, and (again) the spread from the ideal peg should be very small.

There is no actual BTC in your Bitcoin wallet; there are private keys which are used to transfer ownership of BTC stored in the Bitcoin system. BTC never actually leaves the Bitcoin system. A fork such as this creates a copy of the original cryptocurrency. Now your private key can be used to transfer coins on both the original system and the modified system.
It's like if someone got their hands on a copy of the reddit.com database and created super-reddit.com starting with the reddit.com database but with different features. You could use the same login credentials to login at either reddit.com or super-reddit.com. Similarly, you can use the same private key to spend money on the original currency or the modified currency.
So it's vaguely similar to a stock split or spin-off. You have x BTC beforehand, and afterward you have x BTC and x "BTC-X". But very importantly, your wallet will not magically know that it is now able to send both currencies. If your software is not updated, then you will have only the original currency. Your software may also be updated to support only the modified currency. If your software only supports one of the currencies, then you will usually end up throwing away some or all of the other currency when you next send coins after the split, as a side-effect of the transaction (this is called "replay").
Value is unpredictable. Like a stock split or spin-off, you'd *vaguely* expect the pre-fork value of BTC to equal the *sum* of the values of "BTC and "BTC-X". But if a fork like this is anything close to a 50-50 split (in relation to economic adoption/value, not node or miner adoption), then it will be unbelievably, catastrophically messy, which I'd expect to result in the post-fork combined value crashing. On the other hand, if the minority currency is pretty small and things don't get too messy, the minority side could be speculatively overvalued (similar to altcoins) without affecting the majority side too much, causing the combined value to rise somewhat.

There's no Bitcoin central bank that's going to come and change denominations for you. If you want different denominations, then you can use them.
I think that one of the main blockers is lack of good conversion in wallets. Several wallets have the ability to globally change the denominations shown, but since you're often *told* prices in BTC, this becomes difficult to keep track of. If I paste "0.1 BTC" into the amount field of the send window, then it should convert this amount to whatever my local unit is. Same for if I paste "200 satoshi/byte" into a fee field which normally uses BTC/kB units. Etc.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:56:25
You can do something like that, but it still creates a currency fork, though one that looks a little different. Say that an old miner mines a transaction that is illegal under SegWit (ie. it probably has invalid signatures under SegWit). Then old nodes will see those coins as belonging to one person, and new nodes will see those coins as belonging to someone else. As long as all new nodes are full nodes, then this situation is *stable* in that there will be no chain forks, but fairly quickly old nodes will be dealing with a currency that's incompatible with new nodes because old nodes will be receiving transactions that have been tainted somewhere in their ancestry by SegWit-invalid coins. This may well be acceptable, but it'd be a major change in how Bitcoin works, especially since everyone would have to run a full node in order to have any security at all.
What you're talking about in general is having miners act as merely a timestamping service, and allowing them to insert whatever data they want into blocks, even invalid data. A cryptocurrency *can* operate like this, but then everyone needs to be more-or-less a full node in order to separate the valid mined data from the garbage. See [my arbchain post]( where I describe a more complete system that works in this way.

I don't think that squatting is a huge problem. Whoever squats the domain is likely to sell it. It might be good enough to require a large proof of work to create a domain and smaller proof of work renewals every few weeks, with the proof of work difficulty related to the Bitcoin difficulty (but much easier). This would not be quite the same as mining because more domains wouldn't increase the difficulty.

3 &amp; 4 are reasonable points, though insuring the BTC would significantly increase the fees, which would turn off some investors. AFAIK ETFs are sorta supposed to have zero risk except for the risk of the underlying assets themselves, so I wouldn't be too surprised if the SEC demands insurance.
I wonder if it'd be easier to get some big, trusted financial institution to issue an ETN.

IIRC Coinbase has said conflicting things, so I don't know their current position. But I wouldn't trust anyone (especially Coinbase) to get it right on my behalf, regardless of what they say. Recall that after the ETH/ETC split, it took Coinbase a very long time (months?) to allow people to withdraw their ETC.
These forks are difficult because some people will classify one of the forks as a non-Bitcoin scamcoin, and you may disagree with this classification. Anyone can create an altcoin from Bitcoin's chain by modifying and distributing a version of the software with a hardfork or UASF. If I released a version of Core containing a UASF requiring that block 471000's hash end with the bits 11b, then this would likely create an altcoin. Most people would agree that exchanges and others would be right in totally ignoring this stupid forked currency, but maybe *someone* would view my UASF as the legitimate, real Bitcoin and would want to split his 471000-11b-coins from his BTC, and by ignoring the UASF, exchanges would end up destroying his 471000-11b-coins. The problem is that *this stuff is all subjective.* If both chains survive, I myself will classify either the original chain or the BIP148 chain as an altcoin after the BIP148 activation, depending on how things look. My position will probably be that the non-Bitcoin coin is not worthy of much consideration and should be ignored or sold ASAP. If you disagree with *me* about which Bitcoin is "real", then this is at worst an annoyance. But when you disagree with **someone holding your BTC**, it becomes a huge problem.

No. If ECDSA fails, probably all other common algorithms will also fail.


It'd be a good idea to write the code, but putting it into Bitcoin wouldn't do much good because other changes would probably also be necessary.

Yeah. ECDSA will surely fail before then, the max block size will need to be increased, some hardfork changes may be necessary to improve scalability, etc. Trying to make Bitcoin perfect from 0.1 would have been a waste of time because it's impossible. Already, there have been *many* hardfork changes (most done by Satoshi before 0.4).

See coiner2013's answer for the command-line interface. Try `bitcoin-cli help` for a list of command, and `bitcoin-cli INSERT_COMMAND_HERE` for detailed help on any command.
It's also possible to run the GUI (bitcoin-qt) on the server and send it to yourself over SSH using X forwarding. I think that you just need to install all of the GUI dependencies (X, Qt, etc.), make sure X is installed on your home machine, run ssh with the -X switch, and then run `bitcoin-qt` on the command line. (Though I've never actually tried this with Bitcoin Core.) If you're on Windows, you might need to use Cygwin's ssh and Cygwin/X instead of putty.

A lot of miners will immediately start mining on top of any valid header, and only abandon it if it turns out to be invalid after they've spent the few seconds needed to verify it. And verification time isn't very large with compact blocks and/or the FIBRE protocol, both already active. Nowadays when an always-online node receives a block, it's really just receiving a list of txids that it's already downloaded and verified, so it just needs to check that they're ordered reasonably and not mutually exclusive.
Nothing's ever truly unlimited, of course, but the above-mentioned stuff will get you quite large blocks if you give up on decentralization and only think about miners.
If you push it even further, then latency has the effect of centralizing mining even further. As block sizes grow, miners with the highest latency (due to slow connections, slow verification, or distance from the average location of other miners) get more and more orphans until they are priced out. Over time, mining is centralized to high-speed/low-latency connections within a certain geographic area in order to minimize latency. Once you have just one or two miners, scaling is "ideal": you can instantly transfer data between/within one or two entities basically without bound.
Without a full-node-backed economy hard-enforcing max block sizes and other consensus rules, the natural state of the system is to be a dictatorship of a very small handful of centralized miners. But when Bitcoin pays the high costs of mining but is neither immutable, nor decentralized, nor censorship-resistant, then it has no competitive advantage over other systems, and no reason to exist.

Non-standard scripts must be run by all full nodes if they're included in blocks. They're just not relayed by Bitcoin-Qt.
I really like the idea of the scripting system, but it's too *weak* to be really useful. Satoshi removed some of the more useful script ops when it was discovered that one of them had a critical security vulnerability. A Turing-complete scripting system would allow for new, backward-compatible crypto, which would be awesome.

I don't know enough to say what the diplomatic situation would look like. Dubai and Hong Kong have remained pretty free despite both having some ties with the US. I feel like the US would mainly not be bothered by the free city, and would only start taking notice if the free city started actually doing things that the US saw as against its interests. At that point, the US could expend resources to put pressure on Mexico to destroy or influence the free city, but Mexico will only accept this if the loss of the free city's annual fees make it a good option on net. It seems entirely possible to me that a careful free city could be lucrative enough to pay Mexico a lot of protection money, and avoid being too much of a thorn in the US's side, so that it is able to survive long-term. A perfect ancap utopia is probably not possible (and probably won't be possible on Earth anytime soon), but I think you could get fairly close.

No, it uses the whole mnemonic regardless. You can't leave out some of the words just because at a theoretical level they're not providing extra security.
I think that Trezor actually uses PBKDF2-SHA-512 rather than the plain SHA-256 in my example, which always has a 512-bit output. I don't know off-hand which method they use to turn that into keys; they may truncate it to 256 bits, or they may feed it directly into BIP32's algorithm.

When you use the standard message signing function in eg. Bitcoin Core, what *actually* gets signed is the text "Bitcoin Signed Message:**your message**". The text at the beginning prevents someone from unintentionally signing a Bitcoin transaction. (Though it'd be a little difficult anyway because Bitcoin transactions use non-printable bytes.)

SegWit is a particular set of protocol changes for increasing the max block size and making other improvements. The original deployment plan (BIP141 / BIP9) had almost no chance of causing a split. BIP148, which is a specific proposal using the general technique of user-activated softforks (UASFs) is an alternative way of deploying SegWit which might or might not succeed, and might or might not cause a split, depending on various factors. Bitmain's "UAHF" would definitely cause a split.
During a split:
1. Don't keep any coins in a Bitcoin bank like Coinbase. Keep it all in wallet hardware/software which at the very least allows you to export your private keys.
2. See my post here: 
3. If in doubt, don't send transactions or trust any received transactions 12 hours before and up to a few days after the fork time, and wait for further news on If a messy situation actually develops, I'm sure we'll post a sticky or something. Coins at rest are not at risk. The BIP148 possible-fork time is Aug 1 at midnight UTC, and Bitmain says that they'll start their nonsense shortly afterward if BIP148 has much success.

Bitcoin's design is predicated on the idea that a deflationary currency can work. Satoshi intended Bitcoin to behave similarly to gold, which has successfully been used as a money for millennia despite being deflationary, though of course gold has more obvious intrinsic value (though you [can argue that Bitcoin has a sort of intrinsic value]( If a deflationary cryptocurrency is doomed to fail, then probably decentralized cryptocurrency in general is impossible. The rate of inflation is determined by more than just a currency's *monetary* inflation: it also depends on the economy as a whole (eg. the cost of producing beef and oranges). But a *decentralized* cryptocurrency probably can't know the prices of particular goods, so it has no way of attempting to maintain price stability as central banks do. You can make a cryptocurrency have a constant monetary inflation rate of x%, but at basically all times this rate will be either too high or too low for price stability, and any not-insanely-high inflation rate could conceivably lead to a deflationary spiral situation in the same way as Bitcoin's eventual 0% inflation conceivably could.
We Bitcoiners are betting that that alternative view is wrong, the Austrian view (also shared by some in other schools of economics) is correct, and deflation is nothing to be afraid of in this case.

This is very rarely true. Bitcoin is not normally bandwidth-heavy. It's not like BitTorrent or Freenet. Maybe it could use all of your upload bandwidth if one of your peers is downloading the whole chain from you, but I've never seen this. It takes time for peers to process blocks after receiving them, so the data transmission rate isn't so high. And it's rare for a peer to request the whole chain from you.

* What they're doing now has no actual effect, it's just talk. I sorta doubt they'll actually ending up signalling for SegWit in sufficient numbers. Bitmain is especially never going to signal SegWit, no matter what they say.
* If they activate "SegWit" via bit 4 only, then this will be as if they did nothing and let SegWit expire. BIP148/BIP149 would still be necessary.
* If they activate SegWit via bit 1, that'd be good.
* If/when they try to do a hardfork, it'll fail, since everyone will ignore their invalid blocks. There's no way for them to say "we'll activate SegWit, but in doing so we will guarantee a hardfork".
So there's a small chance that this will actually activate SegWit. They're not going to succeed in a hardfork, so this'd be good news. But *probably* all of this is meaningless.

The network's main scarce resource right now is connections. There are only around 4000 full nodes currently. If you assume that all of them have 8333 forwarded and the default maximum number of incoming connections (117), then the network can only support ~468000 connections. Each leech node such as non-forwarded Bitcoin-Qt clients, Bitcoin Wallet for Android clients, Electrum clients, etc. consume ~4-8 connections without providing any to the network. So the network can only support 50000-100000 leech nodes at any one time. This is really bad, especially since the number of full nodes is not keeping pace with the growth of the network. We may soon be seeing serious problems related to this.
If at all possible, run Bitcoin-Qt with port 8333 forwarded. Even if you can't forward 8333, *please do* use Bitcoin-Qt for actual Bitcoin transactions when convenient -- this is helpful for more esoteric economic reasons. But don't run Bitcoin-Qt on a non-forwarded machine *only* to "help the network". This is actually slightly harmful for the network because you're taking up 8 of the network's limited number of connections.

What this means: Bitmain is announcing that if BIP148 succeeds, then they are going to essentially mine a different SHA-256 altcoin instead of Bitcoin. If you don't do anything, it'll be as if mining power dropped somewhat, but you'll be otherwise completely unaffected. I feel like some people might read this statement as trying to force a decision between Bitmain's altcoin and BIP148, but it won't; technology-wise, it doesn't affect in either direction the potential contention between BIP148 and status-quo/BIP149; Bitmain's actions will *not* in any way threaten either a status-quo chain or a BIP148 chain.
I continue to be pessimistic about BIP148's chances; I consider continuation of the status-quo and a somewhat later BIP149 UASF as the most likely outcome.
I kinda doubt that they're actually going to stick by what they say here, but if they do, it only seems good.

If you have a significant amount, I recommend a dedicated device: either a hardware wallet (eg. Ledger), or a dedicated Android device with a Bitcoin wallet, or a dedicated laptop/desktop with a Bitcoin wallet. Be aware that there are a few wallet apps (like the Coinbase app) which are just interfaces to Bitcoin banks.


A Bitcoin-style block chain can never support massive on-chain volume without degrading into something substantially centralized. Block chains are *broadcast* systems; they just don't scale. It's like trying to run the entire Internet off of a single copper wire that everyone has to connect to. Off-chain systems like Lightning are *required* if you want instant, cheap transactions on a Bitcoin-style system. Altcoins often feel better to transact with, but only because nobody uses them: they're like Bitcoin in 2010, when you could send however many transactions you wanted for free because nobody was competing for block space. If any one of them actually got popular, they'd have the same problems as Bitcoin (or, in many cases, even worse).
I recently looked through the technologies of all of the common altcoins to see [which of them are best for tipping/microtransactions]( and none of them do anything to resolve the above issue, not even poorly. (Except for Ripple, which quickly turned into a 100%-centralized system like PayPal masquerading as an altcoin.) There are several things that you could do to sacrifice security/decentralization for higher transaction volume, to greater or lesser degrees, but nobody's done it yet. Maybe some altcoins will try it if any of them actually gets real transaction pressure.
Technology-wise, I'm confident that Bitcoin's scaling problems *can* be completely resolved via Lightning and/or several alternate technologies, to the extent that the entire world could abandon their fiat currencies and use Bitcoin for everything while preserving 90% of Bitcoin's security/decentralization in small everyday transactions and 100% of its security/decentralization in large transactions. But whether and how quickly this actually happens will depend on a number of unpredictable factors. Bitcoin is ultimately made of people, so technical considerations aren't everything.


This is a very dangerous market. You could make a lot of money or lose a lot of money. I wouldn't be too surprised if a month from now the price is either $1500 or $4500. Especially when we're near the all-time high right now, large and long-lasting drops would be unsurprising. If your investment goal is to save for retirement or something and you're not a die-hard Bitcoin true believer, I wouldn't recommend putting much in BTC or any cryptocurrency...
Altcoins tend to more-or-less follow BTC, but they're even more volatile/dangerous, since they're mostly pump-and-dumps built entirely on hot air. As I see things now, the only altcoins that could possibly be said to compete with Bitcoin are:
* Ethereum, the most effective hot-air coin. They have a few more-or-less working features which they use to advertise their coin's utility, but when you look closer, these features are risky and rarely of any real use. It looks like they have a staff of people who propagandize to Wall Street and academia so as to draw in big investors; an effective money-making strategy so far. Their priority is to pump the price as much as possible, regardless of values like immutability or decentralization. They will probably add centralization whenever they run into technical issues such as transaction congestion. If they can keep their system working while keeping their centralization obfuscated enough to avoid regulation, then they may well continue to gain value for some time.
* Monero, which provides significant anonymity (way better than Bitcoin) with a reasonable amount of stability. Their anonymity technology makes their long-term scaling issues 1000x worse than Bitcoin's, though.
* zcash, which provides slightly better anonymity and maybe some scaling advantages over Monero, but using experimental moon-math. Rather underdeveloped software.
* Mimblewimble, which can provide anonymity comparable to Monero/zcash if designed well, and also scales much better than any existing cryptocurrency. Doesn't actually exist yet in a usable form.
(Note that all of the unique features of the above could be added to Bitcoin in sidechains someday. Though sidechain tech is currently in its infancy.)
All other altcoins are pure pump-and-dump.
You can make money on all of this stuff, even the pure pump-and-dumps, but it's very risky.


No, that sort of ridiculous timetable would fail even if they had 100% of miners and 90% of exchanges.
The Silbert agreement was dead-on-arrival. There's a tiny chance that BIP148 could activate SegWit in November. More likely, BIP149 will be introduced in Core sometime this year, and will activate 6 months later. (SegWit increases the max block size to 2MB.) In the interim (and probably rather soon after the 2MB increase), we really need some off-chain system like blinded bearer certificates or high-capacity sidechains, since fees are too high. Maybe RSK will be sufficient.
4-8MB on-chain could be achievable within 2-3 years, depending on how things go. The technologies that would enable safe scaling to those levels are fairly well-known, but complex.

Bitcoin's ECDSA (and most other public-key crypto) is in fact known to be completely busted if anyone can figure out how to efficiently factor numbers. Quantum computers are known to be able to do this, which is why ECDSA is busted by quantum computers. But it's not known whether some efficient algorithm exists for prime factorization on traditional computers. It's not known whether this problem is in P or not, or whether it is NP-complete. If someone gets a spark of brilliance and finds an efficient factorization algorithm, ECDSA (and RSA, DSA, etc.) is busted. There may also be other vectors of mathematical attack than just prime factorization.
Almost all symmetric crypto, including Bitcoin's SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, are designed by heuristic (ie. by educated guessing). You take the input bits and try to devise ways of scrambling them enough so that the required properties of crypto hash functions are maintained. There is no proof that the scrambling is actually effective. It's possible, and it has been done in other hash functions, to find patterns enforced by the scrambling which were not obvious to the author of the hash function. For example, a hash function could, due to its particular method of scrambling, never have bit 5 set if bits 10 and 11 are set. These patterns reduce the difficulty of attacking the hash function; for example, it should take on the order of 2^64 basic operations to find two inputs which result in the same MD5 hash, but due to patterns (ie. weaknesses) found in MD5 long after it was designed, it only takes on the order of 2^18 operations.

Clients can occasionally see it, but they don't do anything about it.

How do you store your coins now? blockchain.info relies on the security of your OS *and* your browser. EWallets require trusting a single central party. Other wallet software is probably no less likely to be affected by OS security flaws.
The situation on Windows and Linux is basically the same: Any software installed on your computer can probably get admin access with enough work and steal your wallet unless you take special precautions (manual SELinux rules, etc.). So you want to install only trusted software, install as little software as possible, and you want to give this software as little opportunity as possible to be affected by security bugs. No web browsing, no open ports, keep the computer offline when possible, etc.
Make sure you back up an encrypted copy of your wallet.

Another very common misunderstanding: If you're trying to use a (decentralized) block chain to determine ownership of real things (a car, a computer, etc.), then the property itself is centralized, so a block chain is pointless. You're going to either need to trust a person to administrate the property, or you'll need the property to be smart enough to administrate itself; in both cases, there's no need for a decentralized block chain when you have a centralized administrator.

Speaking only of the most common mnemonic derivation method: For Bitcoin, there's no point in using more than 12 words because Bitcoin's crypto itself has only 128 bits of security, and 12 words corresponds to 128 bits of security. If you add more words, then it becomes cheaper to attack the public key directly rather than attack the mnemonic, so it's pointless. If Trezor supports any cryptocurrencies or protocols with more than 128 bits of security, then it might make sense to use more words, though it wouldn't be required.
A Bitcoin private key is just a 256-bit number. You can generate an infinite number of deterministic but unpredictable/"random" numbers by hashing a seed. An illustration:
    sha256("mnemonic: correct horse battery staple | usage: Bitcoin | key 123")
    	= c11f1f62135b793b784ee0d3c6c0e237513ffd7047b01fc6eb44a5726e16810f
    sha256("mnemonic: correct horse battery staple | usage: Bitcoin | key 124")
    	= 50c2ab773b121cb18fc8fa5c68f4bdfb171e2dc3b0ff30de291412e33c839a7d
    sha256("mnemonic: correct horse battery staple | usage: Monero | key 123")
    	= b9836adae84a9c97a92e4faf9134762be5e363ac2d70eb4077c70e5654e42982
You just use each SHA-256 output as private keys in this example. (But don't actually use my example method to generate keys.)
How wallets actually do it is somewhat different from the above example, but it's the same sort of idea.

Bitcoin-Qt only takes that into account when mining a block, not when sending transactions. (Even if you're sending a transaction while also solo mining.) When sending, it calculates fees based on the size of the transaction, how much BTC is being sent, and the age of the coins it's spending.

He mainly seems worried about the parameters used in common ECC implementations. These parameters are often defined by NIST, which is influenced by the NSA.

I predict:
* The max block size will not be increased in the near future. Even though Gavin will support it, there are too many strong opponents.
* Transaction fees will increase to something that isn't insubstantial. $0.02 to $0.50 or something like that.
* For a while, altcoins with lower fees (especially Ripple) will experience a boom and the Bitcoin price may drop.
* However, Ripple is dangerously centralized, and Bitcoin-like altcoins can't be much better than Bitcoin in this area (and are usually worse), so Bitcoin will remain dominant in the end. Though maybe not as dominant as today. Experimentation will be more frequent.
* Off-chain transaction systems will be created and will become the main method of transferring BTC.

I guess Nefario ran out of the money he stole and is trying to get more...
My only job in BitcoinGlobal (GLBSE parent pseudo-company) was to securely hold BTC for BitcoinGlobal. I took money when directed, held it, and dispensed it when directed. I had a ~1% share in BitcoinGlobal in payment for this small service (totally not worth all of the trouble...). I never saw GLBSE's code or database, and in practice, almost all of the user money was held by Nefario, not me.
When GLBSE closed, I was ordered by the BitcoinGlobal shareholders to send some amount of BTC to Nefario, which I did. According to the accounting, this should have been enough to pay all users. If Nefario can't pay all users, then he lost/stole some of the money. *His 5% figure is a total fabrication.* The remaining money that I hold has sat in cold storage since then (provable via the block chain) because I have received no valid orders since then and Nefario has not published a list of GLBSE user balances that I could use to verify user claims. I would pay valid user claims from this money, but it would be totally ridiculous to pay people when I don't know what their previous balance was, what they received from Nefario, etc.
The facts of this case are very well-established. BitcoinGlobal meeting logs, etc. were posted which show Nefario's claims to be entirely false. You can read my responses in the relevant bitcointalk.org topics to get more exact figures about how much BTC was sent where, etc.

Lightning wouldn't work well with fees that high. For reasonable Lightning operation, you need to do several on-chain transactions per year. People should probably not have more than a few thousand dollars in value tied up in Lightning channels, and this'll probably be split over a few channels, each requiring a periodic (every 3-12 months or something) on-chain transaction. But even $100/year is a bit high.
If fees did ever get that high, it'd be necessary to do something like create one or more higher-volume sidechains and do the Lightning commitment transactions on there. You could have multiple layers of sidechain, even. There are also other off-chain systems which generate a lot fewer on-chain transactions than Lightning, at the cost of some security: blinded bearer certificates, hub-and-spoke systems, Ripple-style debt systems, etc. So overcoming this would be more of an engineering problem than anything.
Such high fees seem unlikely, though, probably requiring a massive explosion in demand and/or a significant failure to advance technically. For example, SegWit will increase the max block size to about 2MB, and I see a sequence of technical advancements which could allow blocks to safely grow to 8MB or higher *after the advancements are made* (eg. I'm thinking especially of TXO commitments and block-chain sharding). That being said, Bitcoin's first priority is to be secure and decentralized, and the max block size should be neither higher than nor much lower than the maximum size that is safe vis-à-vis security/decentralization. It's not valid in Bitcoin to say "fees are high, therefore the max block size should be raised." Bitcoin isn't some company looking to maximize usage/profit/prices. The correct thinking is, "technical advances in Bitcoin or elsewhere have allowed (not *will allow*, but *have allowed*) the max block size to be increased to X without harming security or decentralization; therefore, the max block size should be increased to X." So while I don't expect *massively* high on-chain fees, if it happens (due to tx demand + technical limitations on safe tx volume), then that's just something that you'll have to live with, and workarounds will have to be found (such as the "more off-chain" off-chain solutions I listed earlier).
(Fun fact: I [recently sent a transaction]( about 9x larger than a normal transaction for $2.85. So about $0.32 per logical transaction, very far from $100...)

Bitcoin-Qt will never send transactions with too-low fees. You can't override its fee algorithm. For other clients, it's theoretically possible to cancel a transaction, but I don't know if any client does this safely. (It's easy to do unsafely, which could lead to accidentally paying twice.)

Precious metals are a good option. Plain barter is also workable.
If you want something with similar properties to Bitcoin but with very different workings, an IOU/barter network might work:
* I can issue an infinite number of theymos-coins.
* I only spend theymos-coins.
* I only accept theymos-coins in payment for goods/services.
* If I trust someone to provide value for their coins, then I can trade my theymos-coins for their coins at some exchange rate depending on how I perceive the relative difference in usefulness of the coins, and with a limit depending on my degree of trust in that person.
* If I want to pay some online shop who's never heard of me, it's done by routing through the trust network. Example: Bob deals with me from time and considers my coins to have value, so he's willing to trade 1 theymos-coin for 1 Bob-coin. Bob works for the online store, so the store will trade 1 Bob-coin for 20 Store-coins.
It's kind of a weird system to think about, and difficult to bootstrap, but if you got a whole community/city/country/world to use it, I think that it would work very well. It's even more decentralized than Bitcoin in some ways, and more scalable, though it's probably much worse as a store of value.
(You may notice that this similar to how Lightning is intended to work, though the idea predates Lightning by a very long time.)
If you're not allowed to use any cryptography at all, this system would I think still be possible, but it'd be a lot more time-consuming because you'd have to do a lot of face-to-face interactions. Maybe someone could still find a way of making it practical. (Though it's not as if crypto is ever going to be made impossible, so it's kind of a pointless thing to think about...)

Gavin is the benevolent dictator of the Bitcoin-Qt project (though maybe less so than Linus is for Linux), but that doesn't allow him to change the network. The network is neither a dictatorship nor a democracy; it's a voluntary relationship between network participants. Your current client will *never* change its network rules under any circumstances, even if *every* miner disagrees. If there was a movement to change the core network rules (the max block size, for example), Bitcoin users would have to decide individually whether to download a new client with the new rules or stick with the old client and the old rules. If you are the only person on Earth who sticks with the old client, you will not be technically forced to adopt new rules. However, you'll probably want to switch when every Bitcoin business does so that you can still trade with them.
Gavin's voice would have a lot of weight in a transition like this, but he'd still need most of the big businesses to agree with him.

If you have less than ~30%, attempting a double spend isn't worthwhile it in most cases. If you fail to get your 6 blocks before the network catches up, you'll lose all of those block rewards and then if you're a pool you'll probably lose all/most of your miners. Also, it's important to note that the attacker can't do better than doubling his BTC (per 6-block reorg), so many pool operators won't have the BTC to make huge profits off of this. This is a good reason to not store large amounts of BTC with your pool.
This is something that merchants can protect themselves against. Very large transfers/shipments out to customers should be handled manually, or at least delayed for several hours. MtGox is reasonably well-protected due to their withdrawal limits and identity verification, for example.

More centralized than today, though I hope that people will still have the option of using real, decentralized Bitcoin transactions when they want. I don't need to send my transaction to every Bitcoin full node and have the most powerful computing network in the world build it into the block chain when I'm buying a cup of coffee.
Bitcoin as it is today can't handle huge numbers of transactions. Increasing the max block size too much would hurt decentralization even more than leaving it fairly low and increasing the transaction fee: in order to verify the block chain, you'd need a ridiculously powerful computer. Maybe someone will figure out how to solve this in a way that pleases everyone, but if not we'll see some more centralization somewhere.

I agree that that's probably the most likely sequence of events. I think that basically *everyone* will chicken out at the last moment for both BIP148 and any "segwit2x" hardfork, mostly due to features of how they're both being deployed. I predict fewer than 6 blocks in all of BIP148's history and less than 1% economic support right after the split, which will quickly vanish. (It will be interesting and informative if I'm significantly wrong about this -- I'm curious to see how it goes.)
"Segwit2x" *could* activate SegWit via bit 1, and it could be compatible with BIP148, but I share your view that the whole thing is a stalling tactic that won't go anywhere.
But one important thing you're missing is that BIP149 will almost certainly be included in Core after BIP148 fails, to UASF-activate SegWit 6-12 months later. And *this* UASF will *not* fail.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:17:45


Yes, but you'll need to use a separate Lightning wallet for now, and the existing ones are all pretty experimental. Someday it'll probably be integrated into Bitcoin Core etc., but probably not for quite some time.
If SegWit activates via BIP141, then it should be safe, but if it activates only via some other method, then I'd want to wait 6-12 months before considering SegWit safe. You want like 95% of the economy to be hard-enforcing the rules of SegWit before you actually rely on it.


You'll have to tie up some BTC in a Lightning hot wallet. This aspect is like how some PoS coins work, but it's very different in that you'll get a fee for every transaction your node processes rather than some interest rate on your tied-up coins.
It may be possible to encourage additional transactions (or higher-fee transactions) by manually cultivating the channels that you keep open. Also, if you send or receive a lot of transactions in your day-to-day business, you will probably be a better-connected node in the Lightning network, and therefore more likely to get many/good fees.
The exact shape of the LN fee economy is unclear to me, though. We'll have to see how it actually ends up developing.


You can close the channel immediately with the other side's cooperation (on-chain), or send the BTC tied up in the channel to anyone on the LN by routing via the other side (off-chain), or close the channel unilaterally after some delay if the other side disappeared (on-chain).


You need to connect to the other party of the channel over TCP or something, and then you cooperate to create one on-chain transaction per direction. So a 1-way channel results in one on-chain transaction, while a 2-way channel results in two on-chain transactions. Creating channel-open transactions is a several-step interactive protocol.
Choosing which node(s) you create direct channels to is an aspect of LN routing with many possible strategies. One simple strategy is to create a direct channel to the intended recipient whenever you cannot route using your existing channels.


To start with, they'll be separate pieces of software. Later on, wallets will probably show them as two separate accounts, like how banks often give you a checking and savings account.

The Earth's supply of oil is being depleted. How will the supply of oil be increased to meet the demand? It won't be, of course. As the price of oil goes up, people learn to use oil more efficiently (hybrid cars, better extraction techniques, etc.), and maybe someday some better fuel will be discovered.
Bitcoin can only safely handle so many transactions per second. Trying to allow more transactions will make Bitcoin weak to attack. But will Bitcoin become useless when we reach "peak tps"? No; as transaction fees increase, we'll learn to use Bitcoin more efficiently with off-chain transactions and other technologies, and maybe someday a completely different and better transaction system (totally unlike any current altcoin...) will be discovered to replace Bitcoin.

It's similar for things like copper and oil. There's only so much in the ground, and more demand isn't going to make more copper and oil. More demand *does* increase the efficiency with which people use limited resources. We'll probably never totally run out of oil because we continuously get better at using it, and if demand gets too high someone will figure out an alternative.
Similarly, Bitcoin can only handle so many transactions because, for security, it is important that it not be *too* difficult to run a full node. More fees won't increase the network's capacity. When demand gets too high, though, people will figure out how to use this resource more efficiently: many transactions will occur off-chain, etc. And maybe some day someone will figure out a way of doing this that is superior to Bitcoin in all ways, and Bitcoin will be replaced. (Though I don't see this happening soon.)

The shorter fork is destroyed. The miners on that side lose their block rewards. Any transactions in the shorter fork but not in the longer fork go back to 0 confirmations, or they become invalid if there is a conflicting (double-spending) transaction in the longer fork. Taking advantage of a netsplit situation to double-spend is very difficult, though; if the attacker can connect to both sides, why is the network split?

Someone should create a Patreon alternative based on Bitcoin. I love the idea of Patreon, but Patreon itself has always sucked. Nobody actually likes the platform. It's only dominant because it was first to market.
Patreon is somewhat reliant on the "set it and forget it" subscription model. You can't do *exactly* the same thing with BTC, though there are various possible alternatives involving smart contracts. But for a first attempt, you could just have a non-refundable site balance which you have to fund in increments of eg. $10 (to encourage you to keep paying at least *someone* on the platform).

Luke is mentioned on that page because he's the main champion of that page, but most people who would be listed there probably already have an activated wiki account, and the others could have their accounts activated by any of a large group of people with that capability. For example, I can activate wiki accounts, and I mostly disagree with Luke on BIP148.

It's fine if you run them at the same time, but you shouldn't send coins from one while the other is running. Bitcoin-Qt is not designed for that, and it might get confused.
Also, they will generate different addresses after a while. (There's a cache of addresses in wallet.dat, but that'll run dry eventually.) So you'll need to back up both of them.

Block sizes are starting to approach the 250 kB soft limit. If blocks are consistently full, transactions will become significantly slower to confirm. This can only be fixed by increasing the block size limit or reducing the number of network-wide transactions. But increasing the block size limit would make running a full node more resource-intensive, and there are already dangerously few full nodes. So fees need to increase (in real value) to reduce the number of transactions, at least until Bitcoin-Qt is improved to be more lightweight, or until some sort of advanced fee handling is implemented.
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:14:50
The incentive is that running a full node is more secure than running a lightweight node. Certain difficult attacks work against lightweight nodes but not against full nodes. So any big Bitcoin business really *must* run a full node if they're not insane. For individuals, it's desirable to run a full node if you can, but it seems that many people are now deciding that the costs outweigh the benefits.


Yes. The strategy of the core devs for improving this is to make it easier and less resource-intensive to run a full node so that more individuals do so. But this is difficult.

All of the power he has is persuasive. He doesn't control any major centralized resources. He resigned as Core committer some time ago, for example.
It is sub-optimal for there to be so few "top experts". If Bitcoin was deprived of gmaxwell, for example, then this would be seriously harmful to Bitcoin because there are only a small handful of people with the same overall level of Bitcoin knowledge as him, and nobody who understands certain topics as well as he does. (Also, he's a good person and I'd be sad if he wasn't around.) Same for sipa, Wladimir, etc. So that's a source of weakness/centralization, but the only reasonable way to solve this is to create more experts, which is awfully difficult. (Though the number of experts has in fact been slowly increasing over the years.)
It'd be nice if all Bitcoin users knew as much as the experts. That alone would make Bitcoin stronger than any possible attacker, for sure. But that's not going to happen, unfortunately.

Without some sort of multisig arrangement it'd be awfully dangerous, of course, but maybe still useful, and a good proof-of-concept.

Anything can theoretically be changed, but the difficulty varies. The naïve way of reducing the target block interval (that is, just changing 10 minutes to 2.5 minutes in the code) would be very difficult. It's probably not politically possible.

Yes, but only if your random number generator is bad. That's one reason why it's generally recommended to create a new address for each transaction: it makes you mostly invulnerable to ECDSA-related problems. ECDSA is considered very strong, but still much weaker than SHA-256/RIPEMD-160.

You'll get an error if you try to send less than 5430 satoshi to any recipient. Also, if you would send yourself change amounting to less than 5430 satoshi, you'll instead add that to the transaction's fees. So if someone sent you a 1-satoshi transaction, you'll probably end up throwing that away. But if you received many 1000-satoshi payments, you might end up keeping some of that money depending on how Bitcoin creates the transactions you send (which is somewhat random).

Bitcoin has several bootstrapping mechanisms. The default mechanism is to get a list of peers from one of a few centralized DNS seeds. If that fails or is disabled, Bitcoin will contact one of many hardcoded seed nodes. Bitcoin also has code to bootstrap via IRC (the original bootstrap mechanism), but this is disabled by default. You can also give Bitcoin a list of nodes to connect to on the command line.
After you connect to the network once, you won't need to use the DNS seeds, etc. anymore. The Bitcoin network has a system which allows every network participant to (over time) get the IP addresses of all other network participants. Bitcoin stores this info in a local database and contacts these nodes when it next starts.

There are two prime numbers `a` and `b` such that `a * b = 260891`. Can you find the two numbers? Probably not in less than 15 minutes without a computer. There is no known currently-doable way of solving this kind of problem without "a lot of work". With very large numbers, even the fastest computers have no hope of solving a problem like this in a reasonable amount of time. (But quantum computers could do it if they are ever created, and it's not proven that an efficient way of solving this doesn't exist for regular computers.) In this example, 260891 is like the public key, and `a` and `b` are like the private key. You can't get the private key from the public key easily, but you can easily get the public key from the private key. All commonly-used crypto is similar to this, and in fact any algorithm capable of solving this problem efficiently would break RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Bitcoin's ECDSA.
You don't need to understand this to understand the Bitcoin protocol, though. The Bitcoin code doesn't do any crypto math directly; that's handled by a separate library. And you don't even need to know the details of the Bitcoin protocol to use Bitcoin.

Some issues with that:
* The network must agree globally or else there is havoc. If most miners are soft-limiting their blocks to 2 MB and then one of them produces a block at 2.1 MB, then you can't have a scenario where 50% of full nodes accept that block and 50% reject it. If that happens, then you now have a broken network.
* There's no incentive promoting decentralization. It's naturally more cost-effective for one huge organization to run all full nodes and serve all of the network's needs. Even assuming that they don't explicitly try to push competing full nodes out of the network, their ability to offer lower P2P fees will tend to reduce the number of other full nodes. So this one organization will have far more control over the network than they should.
* There's not much incentive to think about the future state of the network. For example, if someone starts storing data in the block chain in unfriendly ways (ie without using OP_RETURN), then that's data which must be downloaded and stored by all full nodes forever. But existing full nodes and especially miners have already downloaded the full block chain, and they're probably mainly interested in short-term profit, so they don't have much incentive to preserve the network's long-term security.

DNS. Namecoin isn't a good solution, though. There are a number of optimizations you can do to make running a full node easier. DNS is actually an easier problem than a currency because DNS registrations can expire. Namecoin's incentives and fees are also messed up, and DNS shouldn't have its own currency; it should be based on bitcoins and the Bitcoin block chain.
I argued about this with Satoshi once. I wanted to put DNS data directly into the Bitcoin block chain, but he didn't want to bloat the block chain with data. He came up with merged mining as a solution, though I'm still not happy with merged mining for DNS. You can't have mining unless there's some incentive to mine, but building a separate currency into a DNS system isn't a good idea for various reasons.

The problems with every node enabling pruning is that you still need to *download* all of the block chain, even if the vast majority of this data gets deleted, and if ~everyone enables pruning, it will be difficult to find a place to download this. Also, this downloading process is still very slow; and once you've pruned you can't do a rescan, which is sometimes necessary. There are good ideas floating around for solving all of this. I don't know how soon it'll happen. It probably is a particularly important issue now that 2+ MB blocks are coming soon with SegWit.

You're right that the incentives aren't quite right for miners yet. There is a cost for including another transaction into a block, though it is small. A totally self-interested miner would include all transactions with a fee greater than the cost of including the transaction, and no free transactions. Currently most miners just use the default bitcoind behavior which is good for the network as a whole, but they probably won't always do that. There are several proposals to fix this in the long-term.

It's fairly likely that an unspent-tx-output tree (UTXO tree) will be added to Bitcoin within the next couple of years. Like the Merkle root currently in blocks, the root of a tree of all unspent transactions would be added to blocks. Then you could act almost like a full node by just downloading the block headers and the latest ~1000 blocks in the longest chain. A UTXO tree that deep in the chain would almost certainly be valid, and assuming it is, you could use it to validate any future transaction.


That's right. We don't want to get into a situation where it's impossible to download the entire chain for verification. So at first, the UTXO tree would probably just be used to speed up the initial sync time. You'd download the rest of the chain after the UTXO tree was set up. Later, the chain might be distributed so that you only store a portion of the chain, and you can reconstruct the whole chain by contacting many peers.
There are various problems with using actual address balances. For one, Bitcoin has no concept of addresses at a basic level. It also complicates reorg handling and lightweight node implementation.

Bitcoin's security relies on the fact that certain rule changes, such as the one being performed now, *must* be manually approved by essentially all users. If there was an auto-update system (even if it was opt-out), these rule changes could be made too easily and Bitcoin's security would be severely diminished.
Also, old software is safer software. Every new feature is a potential security flaw. It's best for the network if features are rolled out very gradually so that if something goes wrong, a decent part of the network still survives.  Bitcoin is not like Windows or Chrome -- serious security fixes are *very* rare, and when they happen it's a big deal because they could cost users millions of dollars. With Bitcoin, running year-old software is OK and often a good idea if security is important. Bitcoin-Qt releases are generally supported for at least two years.

There seems to be some bug in LevelDB (or Bitcoin-Qt's use of it) which causes database corruption on Mac OS X. This is important because the number of full Bitcoin nodes is not keeping pace with the size of the network, which could cause serious network instability at some point. We **must** work to encourage full node usage, but bugs like this make it annoying and difficult to run a full node. Also, this bug prevents the implementation of pruning in Bitcoin-Qt because if your database becomes corrupted while you're using a pruned block chain, you'll need to resync from the untrusted network again, significantly reducing security. So as long as this bug exists, blockchain size improvements will probably not be rolled out.

That's why Bitcoin-Qt doesn't have an auto-upgrade feature. Users must decide on important issues for themselves. (Other popular Bitcoin clients aren't full nodes, so they don't really have a say in anything.)
Certain changes can be done by a majority of miners. These include freezing coins (perhaps indefinitely), refusing to accept certain transactions, reordering transactions, or otherwise disallowing things that were previously allowed. Other changes require every (full node) Bitcoin user to individually decide on whether to accept the change. You can reject such changes forever, though doing so segregates you from users who accept the changes. These include increasing the money supply, stealing coins outright, changing certain core parameters, or otherwise allowing things that were previously disallowed.

That's not always true. The network accepts the chain with the highest *total work*. Blocks with greater difficulty contribute more work to the chain. So difficulty-1 blocks are worth less than difficulty-1000 blocks when calculating which chain is "longer". But the *required* difficulty is used (the actual block hash is unimportant), so each block in a chunk of 2016 blocks with the same required difficulty contributes the same amount of work to the chain's total work. As a result, a chain with fewer blocks than another chain can be "longer", but only if the chain diverges before a difficulty adjustment.

Resource usage is fairly low after the initial sync if you configure bitcoind to not accept incoming connections. It does use a lot of disk space.
You'll probably have trouble with bitcoind's disk read/writes before you have trouble with RAM/CPU usage, though I think that even this is low enough nowadays to use bitcoind easily on most VPS.


Use any JSON-RPC library. Or you can write a simple JSON-RPC client in ~10 lines of PHP.:
    function rpcQuery($method,$params=array()) {
        $rpcurl="
        $id=mt_rand();
        $query=json_encode((object)array("method"=&gt;$method,"params"=&gt;$params,"id"=&gt;$id));
        $httpoptions=array("method"=&gt;"POST", "header"=&gt;"Content-type: text/plain", "content"=&gt;$query, "ignore_errors"=&gt;false, "timeout"=&gt;5);
        $context=stream_context_create(array("http"=&gt;$httpoptions));
        $response=file_get_contents($rpcurl,false,$context);
        return json_decode($response,true,100)['result'];
    }


That stuff is listed in the release notes for new versions. New versions are usually announced here and on bitcointalk.org.


Some people like to use kits, I guess. I just use JSON-RPC directly.

Whoever wrote this has no clue... In a MITM attack like this, *unhashed* passwords are exposed. (There's no real way to prevent this. Don't talk about client-side hashing nonsense.) But I actually doubt that any passwords were released, as there were very few reports of suspicious activity. This is all just paranoia in case I'm wrong. (This is true of all previous security incidents -- you'll notice that no list of forum passwords or emails has ever been released.)
Also, as far as we know, the problem was in AnonymousSpeech, not the forum's software. I could have spent all 7000 BTC to hire a hundred full-time security experts, and this'd still have happened. (And this money *is* being used to pay security experts, by the way.)

Bitcoin can only handle a certain number of transactions per second while remaining decentralized. People argue about the exact limit and whether removing the max block size at the network level would cause the network to exceed this limit, but there's certainly a limit. *If* the network's maximum safe capacity isn't enough to meet demand, then we need to find some way of dealing with it. Off-chain transactions are one way. This is decentralized/distributed like email, where are there are some very big players (think Gmail), but you still have many choices of who to trust. Bitcoin itself can still be used to audit these payment processors, and it can also be used directly for large payments. You don't need the most powerful computing system in human history to safeguard your purchase of a coffee.

Absolutely wrong. If that were true, you wouldn't need to upgrade because your client would just do what 50% of the hashing power does. You need to upgrade precisely *because* Bitcoin is not a democracy: you must explicitly *decide* to use the new rules by updating your client. If you don't, your client will continue to use the old rules forever, even if every miner disagrees.

I'm surprised it took so long. LR was always pretty shady.
I used LR a lot in 2010 to trade BTC. Bitcoin Market, the only Bitcoin exchange for a while, operated in a peer-to-peer manner (you had to send money via Liberty Reserve, PayPal, etc. for every trade), and PayPal would shut you down if they saw you trading too much, so I usually used LR. If you wanted to buy large amounts of BTC, you had to send a wire to a *Liberty Reserve* exchange and then exchange the LR for BTC. MtGox was the first exchange to successfully do both ends of the trade, eliminating the LR step. I never used LR after that. BTC was better in every way. I bet that LR has been hurting severely over the last year or two due to BTC.

How's that supposed to solve the double-spending problem? Say that someone in the US makes a copy of his wallet and gives one copy to his friend in China. They both agree to send transactions to different people at exactly the same instant. "Babysitters" aren't going to have any idea which transaction "actually" came first. Just relying on a majority of babysitters won't work because the set of babysitters could change at any time and you'd then get a different answer.
- Attackers can fill up the network with many nodes. They would then almost always have a majority of "babysitters". This is a lot easier than a 51% attack against Bitcoin.
- Assigning nodes to addresses randomly but predictably is probably impossible to do safely.
- Bitcoin is very elegant and clearly correct. This can never be.

Yes, though "bitcoin certificates" could be redeemed more easily and frequently. Also, banks could send bitcoins to each other directly [without actually creating Bitcoin transactions]( You can also do cool things like blind signing, which would allow you to transfer bitcoin substitutes anonymously.

Most miners use the reference client to mine. Mining software is dumb: it needs to fetch work from someone else. Whoever creates the work sets the mining rules.

Reddit is not good for serious discussion. Whenever a lengthy, well-thought-out post is made, it might get a few upvotes, but such posts are usually mostly ignored. Oftentimes, a substantial post will get downvoted to oblivion when someone posts an insubstantial but witty "rebuttal" in response. Similarly, substantial submissions are usually ignored (unless they have really catchy headlines) in preference to articles and memes that require reading less than a couple of paragraphs.
Reddit is for short articles/memes and short, witty comments. Most readers want to *quickly* get the gist of the current Bitcoin news in an entertaining way. This is fine. I enjoy it as *part* of my interaction with Bitcoin. Trying to fight against this would only hurt the subreddit. Instead of meme images, the front page would be full of similarly-short self-posts/articles. That's what people want, even if they don't know it. If I banned even those submissions, we'd lose our audience.
So the policy of is to embrace the spirit of Reddit and leave things almost entirely to the voting system. The only submissions that are typically deleted are off-topic submissions (essentially unrelated to Bitcoin) and spam. If you disagree with this, you can try creating another subreddit.

In April of 2010 I measured my mining production at 160 BTC per kilowatt-hour on my Pentium Dual-Core E5200. I'd get several blocks per day, though I usually turned off my computer at night.
I collected this data because at this time there was no clear BTC price and almost no trading, so people tended to figure out the BTC price using various algorithms which took production cost into account. Using an algorithm to determine the price sounds very strange nowadays when there's a clear market price that isn't even really affected by mining costs, but this is how it was done before there were markets. Based on my data, I determined that a fair price would be ~$0.003, which was my electricity costs plus a small markup. If you look at the really old historical price data, you'll see that my trades at $0.003 were the very lowest in Bitcoin history. (Unfortunately, I was usually the one selling.)

The block includes all of the transactions used to generate the block hash. The block header also has the root of a binary (Merkle) tree of transactions, which can be used to check whether a transaction is in a block without downloading the whole block.


Each miner decides which transactions to include in his blocks. Miners only get fees from transactions they include, so they're incentivized to include at least those transactions that pay high fees, but they're not required to include any transactions. Most miners also include some number of free transactions in each block, but they probably won't do this once Bitcoin gets really popular and blocks can be filled with fee-paying transactions.
Since every full node on the network has to download every block and store its contents for at least a while, it's important that miners don't include too many transactions in blocks. So blocks can't be larger than 1 MB currently. I expect this limit to be increased as technology improves and the network can process more transactions.
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:50:41
*Maybe* Bitcoin would work without a limit. I'm pretty confident that the mining incentive problem can be solved without a max block size, but I'm worried that being a full node would become too difficult over time. So to be safe I prefer keeping the 1MB max block size for a few years or until a hardfork is necessary for other reasons. In the next hardfork, a tree of unspent outputs should be added to blocks. With this change, you can be a full node without downloading all past blocks. After that, I still think there should be a max block size, but it can be much larger and increase along with increases in bandwidth and processing power of the typical full node.
As for the method of increasing the max block size, I think it should remain a constant in the code, but updated every few years. This is reasonably decentralized since users must manually approve the change, and it's likely to be the most accurate.

It's too difficult to acquire them and buy things with them, though this is getting better all the time.
There won't be any problems with the technology for a while. The big controversy will come in a few years when fees start increasing and people want to increase the max block size to reduce fees (which also reduces decentralization). Most altcoins are copies of Bitcoin and don't offer anything other than a temporarily smaller block chain. When fees start increasing, some people might move to Ripple and similar competing altcoins, but I have serious reservations about the security and stability of these systems. We'll see what happens.
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:32:40

The issue is that transactions with many confirmations will now have 0 confirmations, potentially allowing a double-spend. (Though this is unlikely, and requires someone who touched the sent coins recently to be evil.)
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:55:25
That's how it works on the network level. Some clients allow you to send any transaction with 0 fees (and risk having your transaction become permanently stuck). But Bitcoin-Qt forces you to pay fees in some cases.

The network forgot your transaction long ago, or it was never broadcast correctly. Keep Bitcoin-Qt open for several hours. It will rebroadcast your transaction. Make sure that Bitcoin-Qt shows 2-4 bars in the lower right.

It's not very complicated. Bitcoin-Qt will simply never accept a chain of blocks that creates more than 21 million bitcoins. No matter what. If it sees a block that's creating bitcoins too quickly, that block is not accepted, regardless of what other nodes think. (Other clients are less secure in this regard.)
It's possible that Bitcoin-Qt could be changed to allow more bitcoins, but you would need to install the new version of the client for your client to accept this new view on reality. It's said that an *economic supermajority* is required to change such core rules. That is, almost everyone, especially the big players like exchanges, would need to switch. Such an economic supermajority would strongly incentivize the remaining people to upgrade so that they can continue to participate in the economy, though they wouldn't technically be required to do so. (This idea of "economic supermajority" is a feature of economics/society, not a part of the network.)
Such a change is [occurring right now]( Because it is uncontroversial, an economic supermajority will be attained and the remaining Bitcoin users will have to upgrade to continue trading with other Bitcoin users.

Say that your server's wallet has 0 BTC. `getaccountaddress a1` gives you the address for account *a1*. If someone sends 1 BTC to that address, `getbalance a1` will return 1. If you then send all of the server's BTC somewhere else (`sendtoaddress ... 1`), `getbalance a1` will *still* return 1, even though the server has no BTC.
This behavior confuses a lot of people, but it's useful in cases like this. For sites that sell stuff and don't allow BTC withdrawals, bitcoind's API is perfect.

Maybe your thinking was correct, but your terminology isn't quite right. "(System) stack" and "heap / free store" are low-level terms which indicate how the data is *actually* stored. At a higher level, you might say that variables have automatic (stack-like) or dynamic (heap) memory allocation. A std::vector may be allocated automatically or dynamically, but some of its data will always be on the heap. Some of its data may be on the stack if it is allocated automatically.
Bitcoin rarely uses `new` and `delete` itself, though they're used indirectly by the standard library.

Certain transactions will never be mined by miners running Bitcoin-Qt (which constitutes the vast majority of miners) if they don't have a fee. For example, a transaction that's 28 KB in size will never be mined if it doesn't include a fee of at least 0.014 BTC.
There are other types of transactions with "required fees" that will eventually be mined if they don't have fees. Transactions spending recently-spent coins, for example.

If Bitcoin takes over the world, a lot of people will still want to trust someone with their money. It's possible to make secure wallet management very simple, though. The ideal solution would be a dedicated wallet device which:
* Holds a deterministic wallet key in a trusted platform module.
* Makes transactions when given a PIN, maybe limited to some number of bitcoins per day.
* Releases the unencrypted wallet key when given a longer password. (For paper backups.)


It's possible. It'd be huge if Amazon started accepting Bitcoin. I think that big companies will probably be among the last Bitcoin adopters, though. They'll be worried about legal issues.

It's not clear how that could technically be accomplished. The network doesn't know whether you're running a full node or not.
Full nodes only protect the network indirectly. It's not like mining at all. If average people all used lightweight clients, miners and big businesses could conspire to break the rules while still remaining backward-compatible with most nodes. To prevent this, Bitcoin needs a reasonable number of people to use full nodes so that miners and business have a big incentive to follow the rules. Full nodes also provide convenience services to other nodes (relaying, tx/block storage, etc.), but this isn't strictly necessary for the network to function.

This is how the Bitcoin client worked when Satoshi created it: The client maintains a block database and a transaction database. When it finds that its block database is empty, it inserts the genesis block into its block database to get things started. This block includes a transaction sending 50 BTC to 1A1z..., but the client does *not* insert this transaction into its transaction database. So even though this transaction is part of the block chain, if the client sees a transaction spending this 50 BTC, it won't be able to find the 50 BTC transaction in its transaction database, and the spending transaction will be rejected. In other words, the genesis block's transaction isn't considered to be a "real transaction" by the original Bitcoin client.
(Current versions of Bitcoin-Qt handle the block/transaction databases in a totally different way, so the genesis block's transaction is now just a weird special case in the code.)
This could easily have been an oversight, or Satoshi could have intended this transaction to be unspendable. This quirk wasn't discovered until after Satoshi disappeared, so no one had a chance to ask him.

A transaction with a lock time in the future and a sequence number not equal to UINT_MAX is non-final and can't be included in blocks.

The 21 million number comes from the subsidy halving algorithm. The first 210000 blocks generate 50 BTC per block, the next 210000 blocks generate 25 BTC per block, etc. If the halving continues forever, the total number of bitcoins is the geometric series `210000*50 + 210000*25 + 210000*12.5 + ...` Using basic calculus, you can see that this series approaches 21 million, but it only reaches it after an infinite number of blocks. So the *maximum* number of bitcoins is 21 million no matter what, but the actual number of bitcoins that will be generated in practice depends on how long Bitcoin continues the halving. Currently, Bitcoin must stop halving after the block reward would go below 1 satoshi because there's no way to express smaller amounts. Stopping at this point leads to the the 2.09E15 satoshi figure. In 100+ years when this becomes an issue, this may change. But the total amount won't go over 21 million.

You misunderstand how fees work. The fee is *in addition* to the amount that you're sending, and this amount is automatically taken by `sendtoaddress`. You're getting the error because there's not enough money in your wallet to pay the amount to send plus the fee. 0.737 + 0.0002 is more BTC than you have in your wallet. Just send a little less and it'll work. (Probably. Fees are non-deterministic.)

CoiledCoin actually had some interesting features (more than Litecoin does), so I'm not totally supportive of his actions. However, the flaw that Luke-Jr exploited was severe and fundamental to CoiledCoin's design, and I suppose it's better that it was exploited sooner rather than later.
I'm obviously not opposed to experimentation with altcoins. That's why there's an altcoin section on bitcointalk.org. But it's sad and somewhat frustrating to see some people use altcoins like Litecoin that add almost nothing to Bitcoin. There are so many cool things that an altcoin *could* do, but people instead waste time on altcoins that are near-exact duplicates of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a huge first-to-market advantage.

It's also very interesting how that function works. Verifying a signature in public-key crypto requires the public key, signature, and message, right? But if you look at that sign message screenshot, you'll see no place to put/get the public key. (Bitcoin addresses are public key hashes -- *not* usable as public keys.) So how does Bitcoin verify the signature without the public key? It uses a unique property of ECDSA which allows you to calculate the public key from the message and signature. Bitcoin is, AFAIK, the *only* program that uses this property of ECDSA.

The chain can't grow faster than 1 MB per block. (This is a hard network rule like the 21 million BTC limit.)

Not really. Because Litecoin confirmations take less time, having 6 Litecoin confirmations is worth less than having 6 Bitcoin confirmations. Each Litecoin confirmation represents ~2.5 minutes of Litecoin network computation, whereas each Bitcoin confirmation represents ~10 minutes of Bitcoin network computation.
It's perhaps useful for increased granularity, especially with 1 confirmation. 1 confirmation is much better than 0 confirmations, even if this confirmation doesn't represent much hashing power. But under what circumstances can you wait 2.5 minutes but not 10 minutes? 2.5 minutes is still too long for point of sale stuff.

They are totally separate. blockchain.info is a website operated by piuk. Bitcoin-Qt is a full, decentralized Bitcoin client originally written by Satoshi and currently developed by Gavin, Pieter, Gregory, and others. "The block chain" (*not* the same as blockchain.info) is the decentralized database accessed by all Bitcoin nodes.
Bitcoin-Qt is the most secure Bitcoin client. It is the only Bitcoin client that implements the full Bitcoin protocol. Other clients are vulnerable to network attacks that Bitcoin-Qt isn't vulnerable to. It is also the oldest and most stable client.
Blockchain.info uses client-side JavaScript crypto to provide *some* protection in the event that blockchain.info is compromised, but this is nearly useless if you don't use the browser addon, and I wouldn't trust my browser's JavaScript security with large sums of money in any case. Assuming that blockchain.info's JavaScript stuff is secure, Blockchain.info is more secure than centralized E-Wallets like Instawallet, but less secure than lightweight clients like Electrum or MultiBit, and certainly less secure than Bitcoin-Qt.

**Update**: It's unfortunately worse than I thought. There's a good chance that the attacker(s) could have executed arbitrary PHP code and therefore could have accessed the database, but I'm not sure yet how difficult this would be. I'm sending out a mass mailing to all Forum users about this.
Summary: The forum will be down for a while. Backups exist and are held by several people. At this time I feel that password hashes were probably not compromised, but I can't say for sure. If you used the same password on bitcointalk.org as on other sites, you may want to change your passwords. Passwords are hashed using sha256crypt with 7500 rounds (very strong). The JavaScript that was injected into bitcointalk.org seems harmless.
Here's what I know: The attacker injected some code into $modSettings['news'] (the news at the top of pages). Updating news is normally logged, but this action was not logged, so the update was probably done in some roundabout way, not by compromising an admin account or otherwise "legitimately" making the change. Probably, part of SMF related to news-updating or modSettings is flawed. Possibly, the attacker was somehow able to modify the modSettings cache in /tmp or the database directly.
Also, the attacker was able to upload a PHP script and some other files to the avatars directory.
Figuring out the specifics is probably beyond my skills, so 50 BTC to the first person who tells me how this was done. (You have to convince me that your flaw was the one actually used.) The forum won't go back up until I know how this was done, so it could be down for a while.

No. Voting (through mining) is used to determine the ordering of recent transactions because there's no other known good alternative, but the rest of Bitcoin is not democratic.

The issue is more with regular users, not so much with miners IMO. To ensure decentralization, a significant part of the *economy* needs to be backed by full nodes. If block sizes increase to even 2 MB, then disk space, initial sync time, network requirements, CPU/memory requirements, etc. start to become pretty harsh. 10 MB (500 GB per year) would probably wipe out almost all full nodes. Would you run Bitcoin-Qt if it needed 1 TB of storage and constantly used 50-100 kB/s upload (for propagating blocks)? Chances are, you don't even run Bitcoin-Qt with a ~350 kB max block size...

Some off-chain transaction systems (there can be an infinite variety of these with CoinWitness) might require the block chain to prevent double-spending, or they might be centralized. They certainly won't be transacting *real* bitcoins, just promises to pay bitcoins in the future. So everyone will want to use the Bitcoin block chain at some point.

I'm not sure how useful this is. Miners running Bitcoin-Qt will *never* accept a transaction paying less than 0.0001/KB in fees if the transaction isn't eligible for free tx status. So it's entirely possible that a transaction sending 10 BTC with a fee of 0.01 will take a very long time to confirm if the transaction has many inputs and therefore has a large data size. It's even possible for a transaction to be so large that it will likely never be confirmed, though this is rare.

Miners check that transactions are correct. This requires the block chain (or at least the unspent outputs). If you incorrectly accept an invalid transaction, the rest of the network will ignore your blocks, and your work will be wasted.
Pool miners rely on the pool to do this checking for them.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:24:19
You can't lower the transaction fee from the default in Bitcoin-Qt. Bitcoin-Qt calculates a minimum, "required" fee, and the transaction fee that you specify in the program options is only used if it is greater than this required fee. This is done because transactions with too-low fees can end up stuck with 0 confirmations forever, and Bitcoin-Qt provides no way of cancelling a stuck transaction, so it's important that the fee be sufficient the first time.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:08:58

It is important, but mostly for economic reasons, not technical ones. In fact, if you don't have your ports forwarded, running a full node is probably a net drain on the network.
Lightweight clients like MultiBit trust that the majority of mining power is following the rules. Usually this is true. However, if the majority of mining power decided to generate 100 BTC per block instead of 25 (for example), MultiBit would let them do that. Bitcoin-Qt would not. Bitcoin-Qt enforces the rules, even if every miner on Earth tries to break them.
If only a few geeks ran Bitcoin-Qt, then miners could get together and break the rules, and there wouldn't be enough people aware of this to raise a big enough stink to stop it. Bitcoin needs a decent percentage of the economy to be built on full clients so that miners can't get away with breaking the rules. The impossibility of breaking the rules also disincentivizes miners from trying, which is part of what makes lightweight clients safe.
So it's helpful if you use a full client for most of your transactions if at all possible, and automated services like exchanges *really* should use full clients.

@_date: 2013-05-03 17:01:35
Yeah, that might help. It might be difficult to enforce fees, though.


Adding a tree of unspent outputs to blocks would improve this a lot. Then you'd be able to act as a "mostly-full node" after downloading only the UTXO set and the latest few thousand blocks.


First of all, the current version of Electrum misses a big opportunity to support brainwallets and paper wallets, especially on LiveCDs. Stratum is perfect for this, but Electrum assumes that you're using a permanent wallet file that will almost never be deleted. It should have a "one-time wallet" mode which never writes the wallet to disk and never uses change addresses. There should also be more privkey input formats: BIP38, secret exponent, etc.
Electrum's seed mechanism creates passwords that are way longer than necessary. It should work more like my [passphrase utility]( securely hashing much shorter passphrases with user-supplied salt data.
The code is also kind of messy, and I get errors from time to time.

This transaction has extremely high priority because it has very high value, it's spending very old coins, and it isn't too big (bytes-wise). So it's normal that it didn't pay a fee -- this is what Bitcoin-Qt would do by default.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:11:06
All you need to change to make a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency more tolerant of latency is to increase the target time between blocks. A block every week might allow a few hours of latency.
Latency matters because the block chain won't converge as easily or predictably when reorgs are constantly happening due to latency between miners. High latency also makes the network's effects on mining more important than it should be, which could allow additional attacks.
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:44:21
Yep. This ECDSA quirk is a very common source of problems. A lot of more modern EC algorithms get their randomness by hashing the key and the message so that users of the algorithm don't need to worry about the RNG.

I don't like most flair. If the flair is saying, "this person knows what they're talking about due to position/account age/etc.," then the flair is giving their opinion an advantage over others' opinions, which is IMO against the spirit of Reddit. Flair that just represents statistics is too much visual clutter to be worthwhile. The only flair I've seen on other subreddits and liked is the stuff on where the flair tells you what the person's political affiliation is. But that's not really relevant to Bitcoin.
bitcointalk.org has a somewhat different philosophy in this area than I think subreddits should have. (Diversity is good!) Bitcointalk.org, like other SMF/phpBB/etc. boards, is more or less built around user reputation. You identify the users you like/dislike and seek out/ignore their posts, respectively. A person's reputation and history also matters for determining who to trade with. Reddit is more about voting the best comments and posts to the top, regardless of who writes them. I actually prefer sites like 4chan without much concept of user accounts, but when I became admin of bitcointalk.org I decided that it would be impossible to transition bitcointalk.org to a 4chan-like site (just like it's impossible to properly transition Reddit to a bitcointalk.org-like site).
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:38:10
Bitcoin-Qt doesn't make you pay a fee if your transaction is fairly small in data size, lacking any sub-cent outputs, and high-priority (large value, old coins, small size). It expects that such transactions will get into the free area of blocks mined by Bitcoin-Qt. But lately, the transaction volume has been too large, so even these transactions can take a while. This is why you can set the minimum tx fee in the settings.

This is against the rules and the person who paid for upvotes could be banned by the admins. But the submission would still be of great interest to the community, and I should definitely not delete it just because the submitter broke the rules or because the vote count is not quite accurate.
The BitcoinDiscourse submission is clearly of less interest/value to the community than my example above, but it's not appropriate for me as moderator to dictate which submissions are more or less valuable than others.

A Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency is very expensive. Full nodes need to keep all unspent transactions forever. Even lightweight nodes need to download years of block headers. Miners need to expend significant computing power to keep the system safe. Merged mining doesn't solve this: Namecoin doesn't get any of Bitcoin's strength against 51% attacks. In addition to having to worry about DNS problems, Namecoin has to worry about Bitcoin's problems with max block size, transaction bloat, network DoS, transaction fees, etc. Namecoin could maybe have overcome all of these problems (at unnecessarily great difficulty) *if* it had a better economic model and a better way for lightweight clients to do DNS lookups. But it doesn't, and it probably never will, so I strongly believe that Namecoin will fail.
A simpler and better way to do DNS would be to use Bitcoin's block chain for timestamping and maybe BTC for demonstrating proof of work. A currency might not be necessary at all: isolated hashcash-like proofs of work might be enough.

It's an eight-page paper written in 2008 (before Bitcoin 0.1 was released) by a single man. Not a god. In the intervening years, dozens of Bitcoin experts have improved substantially on the Bitcoin technical documentation, and on Bitcoin itself. There have been several major protocol changes since 2008: some done by Satoshi himself, some done by others. Many of these changes were done to fix mistakes made by Satoshi in 0.1. He wasn't perfect.
If you don't like my style of administration, you're lucky that Satoshi isn't still around... He often changed the core Bitcoin protocol secretly without consulting anyone. (The 1MB hard block size limit? Not in 0.1.) If he returned, you'd probably be among the loudest of his opponents after a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:57:42
Each block contains the root hash of a Merkle tree of its transactions in its block header. There isn't just one tree.


You need all of the block headers (80 bytes per block), plus a small amount of data (called the Merkle branch) for every transaction that you want to verify. Merkle branches are less than 1 kB, and you can throw them away after the transaction is buried under enough blocks.
If you use Bitcoin-Qt, then your wallet.dat file already contains all of the Merkle branches that you need. So wallet.dat plus a few MBs of block headers is all you need to run in SPV (lightweight) mode.

Wikipedia will probably give you the necessary basics. I myself have not read any good books on the subject, and in fact I'm not terribly familiar with the math.
ECDSA works like other public-key crypto. Like other public-key algorithms, certain parameters need to be agreed-upon ahead of time between the participants (like key size, the RSA public exponent, etc.). ECDSA (and other elliptic-curve crypto) requires that the participants agree on the exact shape of the elliptic curve on which the crypto calculations are to be performed. secp256k1 is one such curve, but many others can be used. Certain curves are known to be less secure than others.

Accounts aren't segregated in bitcoind. If an account sends 1 BTC, that BTC could come from any address/account in the wallet. So there is no "real" balance of bitcoind accounts. An account's balance is the amount received minus the amount sent/moved from that account, regardless of how much BTC is actually in the wallet or in the account's addresses. This works fine for the most common cases; in more complex circumstances, you probably don't want to use accounts.

Yes. That's the appropriate way of handling fees: you should be able to set a fee per transaction and then cancel transactions that don't go through. It's a difficult feature to add, though. You can't just remove a transaction from your wallet and say it's cancelled: it could still get confirmed even if it's not in your wallet, perhaps causing you to pay twice. To cancel a transaction properly, you need to send a transaction that conflicts with the original transaction and then wait for *that* transaction to get confirmed. That transaction might also need to be cancelled, and the cancellation could also be invalidated if the original transaction gets confirmed before the cancellation. And it gets even more complicated when you think about reorgs.

Bitcoin can't be *killed*, but governments could do an awful lot of damage. Governments probably/hopefully aren't smart enough to try any really effective attacks until it's too late, though.
The most likely attack IMO is for them to simply outlaw the exchange of BTC for fiat. They wouldn't target individuals much, but they could shut down all convenient exchanges. This'd push Bitcoin underground and hurt adoption. It may already be too late for this to seriously hurt Bitcoin, though; the Bitcoin economy is starting to become self-contained.
Probably the worst thing they could do is get a lot of users to run software that destroys their bitcoins. This would seriously damage Bitcoin's reputation and economic stability/usefulness. I could imagine this happening if a few big sites like bitcoin.org were compromised while there was a network alert urging everyone to update. Then a lot of people would "update" to the government's evil Bitcoin clone and lose their bitcoins. Bitcoin releases are signed, but not many people check the signatures.

I believe that the community is better-off overall if people are allowed to keep themselves safe without the top-down intervention of moderators.

It's not my personal forum. When I first asked for donations, I didn't even have ssh access if I remember correctly...
By sitting on it, the forum has made a ridiculous amount of money in real terms. Most of the donations were small in value when donated. And most of the forum's money is from ads, not donations. Spending all of the forum's money would be very reckless.
Most of the forum improvements that I wanted have been done *by me, for free*. So I'm not inclined to pay for a huge forum rewrite anymore unless the offer is perfect. I admit that a security audit and security bounties would have been a good idea.

Here's how the Bitcoin Forum does it:  
I prefer sha256crypt over bcrypt because SHA-256 is a more widely used algorithm that's recommended by several standards. Contrary to myth, bcrypt is no more resistant to brute force attacks than sha256crypt when an appropriate number of rounds is used.

Very pretty. The info is also mostly correct, if over-simplified in places.
I forwarded my bitcoins.org and bitcoin.net domains to there for now (until I get around to putting up some unique content). Now all of the common Bitcoin domains are fairly newbie-friendly. :)

Yes, 0-fee transactions are possible with Bitcoin-Qt if the transaction has high enough priority and low enough size. But block size isn't taken into account when sending.
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:31:49
Transactions generally appear in blocks in the order in which they were received by the miner, though this isn't a guaranteed property. Transactions aren't timestamped.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:33:26
Re-issuing the coins wouldn't be fair because people started using Bitcoin with the expectation that lost coins would be lost forever. It wouldn't be much different than printing more than 21 million bitcoins. If you don't like Bitcoin's deflationary economics, don't use it.
Some developers advocate permanently destroying probably-lost coins after a few years. This would simplify some things, and it'd prevent these coins from ever being recovered if ECDSA was broken.
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:23:11
This will be corrected within a day, and things will totally settle soon.
Satoshi wasn't perfect. He used some "magic" libraries without understanding totally how they work. This bug is caused by some behavior of the Berkeley DB library that was previously unknown. There's also been some unexpected behavior with Bitcoin's use of OpenSSL. It's difficult for developers to notice these things because the code is already written to assume certain behavior, so you naturally expect the library to actually behave in that way! I think that Bitcoin-Qt will gradually move in the direction of removing its dependence on these big, unpredictable libraries. This is a difficult and potentially dangerous task, however. 0.8 replaced much of its use of Berkeley DB with LevelDB, causing this incompatibility.
It's interesting how well Bitcoin's automatic self-defense mechanisms worked. 0.7 immediately put itself into safe mode (preventing automatic transactions) when it detected the bad block.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:25:24


Yes. See:  
Interestingly, the standard NIST curves *do* use suspicious constants that could perhaps be indicative of backdoors. But Bitcoin uses a very unusual curve (used by almost no one else) without any suspicious constants. Why did Satoshi choose this curve, I wonder?

That's a problem with blockchain.info, then. The Bitcoin network won't allow such inaccurate timestamps. Block timestamps are accurate to within a few hours.

Yeah, IIRC I was still in high school at that time. I had an interest in decentralized networks before that. I'd played with Freenet and Tor and investigated the inner-workings of BitTorrent, Gnutella, etc. I was fluent in JavaScript and PHP. Bitcoin motivated me to become fluent in C++.

The data that you need to download is only about 10GB. Most likely, you're seeing that extra size due to a bug in Windows Explorer which causes it to double-count Bitcoin's files when determining the size of a directory.

That is tempting because I've invested a fair amount into SMF already, but SMF's coding style (especially its way of handling escaping) is messy and insecure. There are undoubtedly many security holes in SMF already, and I'd be afraid of introducing even more if I made the huge modifications that I'd like to make.

"I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume." -- Satoshi
Bitcoin may be replaced by something better in 10 years, though I think that it's more likely that Bitcoin will survive and be very popular.
The protocol and network will look a lot different. There will have been at least one major hardfork that changes quite a bit of the protocol. A lot of transactions will probably occur through a payment system on top of Bitcoin because Bitcoin transactions will be somewhat more expensive than they are today. Maybe Bitcoin transactions will work more like email and you'll send transactions to an address like theymos with many different transaction providers that only occasionally settle their debts with each other and with customers using real Bitcoin transactions.

A zero-day total break in ECDSA is the only thing I can think of. Bitcoin can recover if SHA-256 fails. A remote-code execution vulnerability in Bitcoin-Qt would be pretty terrible, but we'd probably recover from that eventually.

If you accepted the blocks which break the max block size rule, you would be unable to transact with people who do not accept such blocks. People will be incentivized to use whatever the *economic* majority is using. What miners are doing doesn't really matter here.

They wouldn't need to stop mining. Bitcoin only uses the first and last blocks of a difficulty cycle for calculating the next difficulty, so whoever mines the last block in a difficulty cycle can set the timestamp a few days in the future to reduce difficulty. Legitimate nodes will initially reject such blocks (that are in the future), but if the attacker has 51% of the network, they'll still have the longest chain after the invalid block becomes valid in a few days. This is a known flaw in Bitcoin called timejacking.
I doubt that this will ever be exploited, though. It's very expensive, and it *would* be fixed if someone tried exploiting it. (There may also be other reasons why this isn't likely that I'm forgetting.)

They don't have a lot of influence currently. They pay Gavin, but Gavin isn't obligated to follow the Foundation's orders on anything. jgarzik and maybe some other core Bitcoin developers get paid by other organizations, so the Bitcoin development group isn't "owned" by the Foundation. Aside from this, the Foundation seems to work mainly on legal issues.
I think that the Foundation's actions are mostly good at the moment, but we have to watch it to make sure that it doesn't get too powerful. In particular, some people want the Foundation to take control of bitcoin.org, which would create too much of a single point of failure IMO. Bitcoin.org should be controlled by a separate organization, as it is now. (Bitcoin.org is owned by Sirius, who received the domain from Satoshi before he left. The content is managed by the Bitcoin development group, though.)

It depends on how badly ECDSA is broken. That might be true if it takes several hours to break an ECDSA public key, but not if it can be done more quickly.

Agreed. While I'm not opposed to the Silk Road and I don't wish ill of its founder, I kind of hope that their servers are successfully raided so that people become more aware of the limitations of anonymity software. It seems that a lot of people see the term "cryptography" and think that the system is unbreakable. There are many not-too-difficult attacks against Tor, especially against hidden services. And even if these attacks didn't exist, Tor is centralized: its security can be totally broken by gaining control of a majority of the ~9 authoritative directory servers. Not impossible for the US government.

Ancap. When I was ~13 years old I started at the opposite side of the spectrum as an anarcho-communist. I slowly moved toward libertarianism when I realized that my goals were best achieved through a smaller government, not a larger one.

Not really. The recent accidental hardfork bug was corrected in just over 120 blocks IIRC.
@_date: 2013-01-29 23:13:22
Lightweight nodes trust whatever 50% of miners say. Full clients refuse to accept invalid blocks/transactions, even if *all* miners accept those blocks. For full clients, an attacker with the majority of mining power can double-spend and nothing more. For lightweight clients, the attacker can create unlimited bitcoins out of thin air or steal coins that the attacker never touched before.
Full clients can do pruning safely. Bitcoin-Qt 0.8 will do something like this. What makes a full client "full" is that it stores all *unspent* outputs.
The Merkle tree is not part of blocks. The root is in the header, and you can construct the tree using the transactions in the block.

That doesn't work because recent PHP versions by default have security.limit_extensions set, preventing .jpg files, etc. from being executed in that way.

Tor is centralized. All Tor relays are registered with a handful of authoritative directory servers, which do perform tests like that. But this results in really fast relays getting a higher rating and being used more, reducing security: The NSA just needs to create a few really fast relays and they'll be seeing a large percentage of Tor traffic.
Tor is a fast and easy-to-use anonymity network, but I don't consider it to be terribly secure.

It's interesting that you can kind of see how well the candidates are at speaking by looking at the SoundCloud amplitude charts (or whatever they're called).
It's nice to hear the candidates speak, though I didn't get much new info from this. Joerg Platzer is probably the best speaker, but Elizabeth Ploshay was also pretty good. I still strongly prefer Elizabeth. Unlike the other candidates, she seems confidently libertarian in her beliefs, and she has a lot of political experience. I especially like that she's explicitly and correctly addressed the issues that I'm most worried about. Some quotes from her:










I admire Joerg's enthusiasm for crypto, but I don't think that the Foundation is the right organization to lead us forward in that area. The Foundation will always have special interests, and it is in the US, so IMO it is dangerous for it to be involved much in important things like development. I don't want a lot of people involved in development to be getting paychecks from the Foundation (or any single source), lest the imperfect and centralized Foundation gain too much influence over important network decisions.
The Foundation is a legally-defined US organization, so it's well-suited for doing legal/political work. I'm an ancap, but I recognize that it is often necessary to follow unjust laws, especially when you're running a business. The Foundation can make this easier by solving complex legal issues. Lobbying probably won't help a lot, but it's unlikely to do any harm. Politicians might tend to think that Bitcoin is a dangerous criminal-money that must be stopped ASAP; the Foundation can try to convince them that Bitcoin is useful for non-criminals, and even necessary for the US to remain competitive in the world market.

Just because it's needed doesn't mean that Bitcoin provides it. No matter how you optimize Bitcoin, every full node must at least see every transaction performed on the network. That's where Bitcoin's security comes from. Due to this, the costs per transaction will never be small enough to support microtransactions.
Bitcoin could be used to *back* a microtransaction payment system. Such as a blind signing system, which would also be more anonymous than Bitcoin. Also, payment channels can be used in some microtransaction cases.

Bitcoin-Qt is the only client capable of fully enforcing the network rules. Other clients can't actually tell whether the transactions they receive are valid. SPV clients like MultiBit trust the majority of miners to verify transactions. Clients like blockchain.info trust central servers to verify transactions. Full nodes (currently only Bitcoin-Qt) don't need to trust anyone.
Full nodes will follow the rules no matter what, even if *every* miner disagrees. The only power that the majority of miners have over full nodes is the ability to reorder recent transactions. This allows double-spending of recent transactions, but it does *not* allow producing bitcoins out of thin air.
