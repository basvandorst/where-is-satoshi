I mean in general whenever there's a huge price drop, let's think of it more as a sale than a "correction". We already know it's just going to be higher in price eventually!

Coinomi and Copay are my favorite if you want to use a smartphone-based software wallet.
Most importantly, write down your passphrase words/private key and DON'T LOSE THEM.

yes if you don't mind downloading the entire blockchain to your computer hard drive. Any wallet that's offline and gives you access to your private keys are best. Exchanges are never a good idea to store your coin, because then are they really your coin?

Paper wallet. 
Hardware wallet.
Access to your private keys are what's most important. Safeguard them.

Correction dip, meaning I get to buy more at a low price and hodl &gt;:D

It's not impossible but if you're up for it, build one. Honestly just buy a Ledger Nano or Trezor instead.

I think I'm gonna sell all my coin, it's getting risky.

All the markets are in disagreement with each other so the price keeps going back and forth $680-700... STABILIZE!

This was announced on their blog Friday. They want to ensure activation of BIP 91 goes smoothly before they are confident enough in re-enabling BTC trading. Link:

Thank you for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:34:10
You're absolutely right.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:50:53
Look at the size of those blocks... nowhere near 1 MB now &lt;3
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:28:49
Well you gotta remember SegWit isn't fully implemented until sometime next month during the next activation period. All BIP 91 does is reject non-SegWit blocks, effectively making activation period 20 a given. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:26:27
Before BIP 91 activation between 900-990 KB, now they're around 650-700 KB.

I meant that's the point of the meme. It's supposed to be a JOKE. You're thinking too hard about this.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:18:02
You misinterpreted wrong. The meme is pointing out the fact that BTC went up from ~$2575 earlier this afternoon to ~$2700 before sending out emails to their customers in an effort to bring the price down again. 
I can't believe I just had to elaborate on a freaking meme. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:39:59
Because it is signalling segwit, as this guy mentioned already. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:34:30
You're absolutely right.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:23:58
That was the point.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:42:25
SegWit isn't activated yet, but the blockchain is now rejecting non-BIP 141 signalling nodes, which may or may not be having an effect on the block size dropping.
