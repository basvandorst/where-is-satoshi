Dogecoin to the moon? It's steadily dropped like 40% this week lmao.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:45:56
Yup. I hope all of us at this time next year aren't wondering if he was right all along.

Im about a paycheck negative right now and my mood has barely changed. Some people just shouldn't be investing in this..
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:15
I hope everyone that took out a second mortgage waited until the opportune moment to get in..

It's gone from $1.36 back to barely over a $1 on about 7 hours. It's having a rough ride just like everything else, it was just late to the party.

Im still waiting on $800 worth from last week. Cleared my bank 3 days ago. Worth like $600 now and the transaction hasn't even hit my wallet yet..

And don't borrow money to invest. Even though I think the $750 cap for credit cards is totally fine as I dount that can really ruin anyone's life

17,800 here. Diluted a bit with 14,300 during the fall.  I'm in the same boat. We'll be ok eventually.

If you think $2.5 is alot of cash, you probably shouldn't be in this biz
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:42:56
There probably won't be much, but I am also quite interested to see where we actually are a year from now.

Pepperidge Farm remembers

Same here. Between losing my ass chasing shorts on the stock market (see RIOT) and these past 4 days, I'm losing bad. Lesson learned. What I have in, I'll just leave in at this point. No more risk for me.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:14:22
Odds are he would have bought back in way back then and still be stupid rich..i wouldn't worry to much lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:41:25
Not if you're decent in this game. I jumped in a couple times in small amount between 17800 and 19450 for the first time all within like 4 days. I threw it into XRP during the crash and I'm already in the green even though i definitely shouldn't be..
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:42
Cause Ripple finally just hit negative in the past 24 hours
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:36:43
We'll see..
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:55
Totally not. I guarantee there are people on suicide watch right now
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:08:51
I wouldn't buy until it hits 4 digits this time. I have a feeling it could go that low :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:55:13
And you didn't pull the trigger why? I've only got a measly 500 and I'll be buying FARRR more soon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:51:42
We get it...Saiyan names are either puns or slight alterations of vegetables. With regards to Kale...they didn't even bother.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:00:31
Agreed! This is basically my "broke even" level though which blows. I was up $3k this time last month..
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:58:47
That's a great story. You still should have been selling on the way up. You gunna hold forever? What's the point of investing if you never take your profits? I have a buddy who's portfolio is basically trash now because of the same thing. He was up like $15k. Could be years before real gains come back.
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:50:55
That's it? Pathetic.
