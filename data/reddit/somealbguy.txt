yeah but I wanted to retain all the information for those who may need it for high resolution graphics later, they can scale it down later :)

Hey guys, I made these [Public &amp; Private key logos]( let me know what you think, hope you like them.
Images are in .png (transparent background) and free for public use :)

yeah :) but i also noticed the old images map was not entirely correct on the coastline and some islands that's why i changed it

For me it doesn't matter at all, the first image I uploaded was Europe-Africa centered but it was not geographically correct it was a bit stylized so then i changed it to the Americas, you can check these [here](
I now updated the image with Europe, America, Africa and half Asia, that's all i can fit :) sorry China (it's because you banned us so many times)

if your computer is corrupted a hacker can get hold of the private key.
you can 'download' bitaddress just by 'save as' and run it on an offline computer, that is the safest way.

True but this is just the start, it takes weeks/months for the whole cycle, as soon as the price is learned (if made public) then we will see more activity, guaranteed :)

also about the first image, keep in mind that the background is transparent so the dark grey of imgur is showing, the image it self looks like [this]( with white background
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:03:05
you are right, I added a new version with your suggestion.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:49:36
thanks for the info, I compressed them.
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:50:52
okay I updated the continents, what do you think?
