It was spammed with extremely low value transactions (where the transaction fee was higher than the value of sent btc) which suddenly stopped. There are several theories who financed it and what was their goal (banks trying to discredit btc, miners against lightning network, bch proponents to weaken btc, etc.)

But it's unrealistic to think that everyone agrees to this. Besides cartels (which are illegal in most countries ) , I don't think it ever happened on the markets.

This is dumb. Mining a block takes the same amount of time &amp; energy if it has 1 or 200 transactions. Not filling a block is throwing away free money. They are losing money just to fuck up bitcoin.

So the processor across town has access to internet? How does the farmer - living in such a poor place that doesn't have any kind of internet -  spend his money?
BTW there are very few places on Earth where you can't get any kind of internet access - usually in places where hardly anyone lives. In the third world 3 and 4G cell infrastructure was built up like crazy in the last few years.

If there is cell coverage, you can have internet. There is not a single cell phone provider that wouldn't support some kind of access to the internet. Interestingly, the poorest regions in Earth usually have more modern cell networks, since they are recent development and they didn't have any other (wired) data connection before, so no competition.

I get it that it helps with redundancy, I just don't see the real utility. Kind of like burying a printed-out copy of wikipedia - in case of apocalypse, it will come handy, but what are the chances of that?
Cryptocurrency is digital cash, it was one of the goals of creating bitcoin. It's not really useful without digital communication, so this step just seems unnecessary right now. When (and if) crypto replaces fiat, then it's reasonable, until then it's a strong "meh".

But can you tell me a scenario when you need to quickly verify payment in a remote location without access to the internet?
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:29:42
You can find sellers on localbitcoin who sell for wire transfer or paypal. That is the fastesr way.

What's the actual use?
What can you do with the blockchain if you can only observe it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:54:41
Thanks, that makes sense.
I wonder if the next step is having a hardware wallet that communicates with either the satellites or over cellular network. That way a user won't rely on the internet at all. Although the hardware for satellite comm is too large at the moment, and dealing with hundreds of cell carriers sound like a nightmare. Amazon has a similar deal with its Kindle - I wonder how much money did that cost.

Can mining also work without internet?

Who runs a full node? Even the US and EU most people use light wallets or webwallets, I seriously doubt that anyone living in the Sahara desert or the barren Russian tundra would run a full node, with the complete blockchain.

Umm... the name of the trustee is not a secret, it's right in the linked document. (Bankruptcy Trustee: Nobuaki Kobayashi, Attorney-at-law)

How did you not notice it's the same address?

The information superhighway then.

Crypto cannot be really diversified, there is correlation between most coins, that's why everyone says never put all your savings into crypto. 
It's also a single entity from a regulatory standpoint. Wait until some influential politician's chidren fall into some scam involving crypto...
Do not put all your savings into crypto! One of the most repeated advice to new investors is: only invest as much as you willing to lose.
Just a couple of hours ago a small exchange became insolvent after losing 150,000,000 USD worth of coins.
It's risky.

He lost it on  MtGox. 
Also, it was an intermediary, just some guy who sold him his pizzas ordered from a restaurant.

So only the miners should use it? They are the ones who automatically get coins, everyone else needs some kind of fiat-crypto exchange. Selling products and services for crypto can also be banned. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:43:26
If you wire money to bitfinex, they automatically exchange it into tethers. Kraken has usd/usdt. Crypto only exchanges also have usdt pairs, so people can speculate on crypto as a whole. It's useful and something like that is needed, despite the concerns about Tether. After reading the Bitmex research report, I'm more inclined to believe that they have the usd, but that doesn't mean everything is fine.

In most countries you have to pay tax after any income, many places now have networked cash registers connected to the local IRS. By supervising and monitoring businesses, the government could pretty much ban selling anything for cryptocurrencies.

I'm pretty sure that they decided no. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:40:56
I have to say, this is pretty lazy especially for this price.

Why did some of the coins came through coinmixers then?
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:19:24
Depends on how much you want to buy, but for small amounts (less than 1000 Euros), localbitcoins.com can be the fastest and easiest way. It seems expensive, but when you factor in the wiring/exchanging/spread fees, it can be competitive, you don't have to deal with KYC and you get your btc in your own wallet.

What's your opinion on mt gox? Do you think people shouldn't get their money back and there should be no recourse against the owners? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:54:46
Yes, but everyone agreed before the fork that noone uses the old one, so the new coin inherited the BTC name. The problem now is  that the old coin is still alive and has no plans to die, therefore wants to keep its name 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:18:07
Ideally, yes. But simply stealing the name for a minority fork is definitely not cool. BCH is also stretching it, but at least they added "cash". Confusing the general population does not help crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:04:14
By sending an empty email? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:52:26
So what happens after the fork? If you buy BTC on coinbase, what will you get? Will it be compatible with BTC wallets? How will you know if you get s2x or s1x bitcoins? How is this different than simply forking every coin and selling them on their original name?

You can try to murder people in the US and wouldn't get into trouble until you actually kill them?

He was communicating with a covert agent since 2012, and he faciliated a deal to sell cocaine to one of his employees, who got busted. Then there is communication about killing the employee, and he wired 80.000 USD to the feds for it. [Source](
That's on top of the affidavit everyone knows, and they say that they will have more charges after finishing the investigation.
I wouldn't call it circumstantial.
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:32:00
You don't think that if the feds can't get to his money, they will be more hard on bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:30:25
He requested evidence about his employee being tortured and killed. The FBI faked the photos, and DPR sent the remaining 40,000 USD to them. If that's not incriminating, I don't know what is. Also, you have some pretty interesting interpretation of "zen".
(BTW, the fake-killed employee's crime was that he was the recipent of multiple kilos of cocaine in a trade that DPR faciliated with a covert agent. He got busted upon recieving the coke, so DPR had to kill him, 'cause zen.)
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:11:16
Because he thought that the agent is some hardened criminal. That's how they got in touch. The agent wrote him a message about selling large ammount of cocaine in Silk Road, and asked him how would he go about it. They were talking about multiple kilos at once, not grams shipped with FedEx, so DPR hooked him up with an employee of his. I guess he was interested in the commission or the employee wanted to sell by grams, who knows. So he thought he was dealing with some real gangster, and I think he found it believable that Al Capone doesn't really deal with bitcoins. 
The wire transfer was from a bitcoin exchange, not his personal account though, but it's not hard to connect that after he got shown the evidence of the successful murder the "hitman" got the agreed upon price from somebody trough a bitcoin exchange is not some freak coincidence.
