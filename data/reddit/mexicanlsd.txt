I’d love to see that happen
In how many years do u see that happening?
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:55:07
Jajaja enjoy my ac? Lol man you’ve gone full retard
Just to remind you the original comment didn’t mention anything about hate towards America... not even criticism towards America.
The one with political hate is you amigo, just because someone doesn’t agree with the mad orange tariffs doesn’t mean he hates America 
But anyway good try dipshit :) 
Hope you find peace

Damn man this is r/bitcoin 
I can tell from what you wrote you really miss r/the_donald but that’s not our fault amigo!
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:17:04
So if all miners agreed on changing the rules they could?
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:49:45
Just like Saudi Arabia my dude but you don’t seem to care about it so ima conclude you’re kind of racist and get informed by some tweets 
Anyway

Yeah the thing is as I told you i’d love to see it but I don’t see it happening sadly haha
Venezuela and Zimbabwe are not enough to change the monetary system and the US has a shitload of assets that are worth way more than the debt so the dollar is not going anywhere. 
What I do see is a lot of countries switching to digital money but at the end “fiat” and bitcoin co-existing with the dollar.
But it would be cool to imagine a timeline haha!! Just food for thought

Good now get it out of robin hood lol
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:29:24
Man just get your btc out of robin hood hahaha god damn man...
@_date: 2019-11-07 04:19:51
I don't see how you would need to pay taxes...
 You would just have to transfer from the exchange to a cold wallet, the btc would not change to fiat so its not a taxable event...
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:14:20
Could you explain why?
@_date: 2019-10-12 23:33:06
Open any major exchange and look at the sell or buy orders.
Yes, like 100 how do you think the price crashes or rises so fast?
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:25:03
As long as you don’t change it back to dollars it is not a taxable event, therefore you shouldn’t declare it
@_date: 2019-10-11 23:09:01
Ok I get it but how does it affect the economy and more importantly bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:58:33
If btc hits a million the price volatility would be lower than today. Basic math amigo
@_date: 2019-10-12 23:30:13
You can sell it in seconds man what you on? Jajaja
@_date: 2019-10-30 00:03:18
Wise lol
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:07:11
Wisw statement my man
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:48:48
Ok i can understand that, what i don’t get is where are we getting it from? I don’t think the American law mentions cryptos or labels bitcoin or alt coins as “goods/services” but ok
@_date: 2019-10-12 23:31:37
"has the technology progressed" jajaja lol
 damn son stop repiting things you hear online and learn how to do a proper research
@_date: 2019-10-04 04:31:15
Cause it's the most COOL/smart/logic idea in the economy since the invention of the bill maybe?

@_date: 2019-05-12 19:01:24
