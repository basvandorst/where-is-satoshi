1099s are used when businesses pay individuals and llc's. So when a company fills out a 1099 to become a vendor, filings don't occur when they are corporations. So I believe this is backwards. The customers would be paying the merchants and wouldn't be having 1099s filed by them.

The makers of Flappy Birds are acquiring them. They should just go ahead and make a public statement before rumors go flying everywhere.

I sleuthed further. The original servers are still up. It looks like their latest blog post hinted that they knew they were about to face some trouble.  Check out

Can you tell me a little more of what is involved in getting approval from the biller? "*We will need to call and obtain approval from your biller" is on the payment page.

Perhaps some banks are declining to accept USD transfers from mtGox... Announcing a temporary suspension while they address that would definitely be smarter than sharing that US banks are declining their incoming transfers. I just feel like something is fishy. Why Two weeks?

They are claiming a link from the liberty reserve website is what got their domain seized. They are claiming they are fully operational.

I've heard from other users that it isn't just USD withdrawal. Other currency withdrawals are down too. I'm not sure why the announcement doesn't say that. They're still accepting deposits, so that's a good sign that it isn't frozen.

Oh great. I bet it got seized due to the liberty reserve crap. They used to allow funding via LR prior to the seizure. I just have them my info at the conference too and received my card. =(

This seizure is Liberty Reserve related and the article fails to mention that. People should definitely mention that before rumors start flying around and fear strikes the bitcoin community. The last thing we need is for the price to go down on some negative news for an exchange that accepted millions of dollars of liberty reserve.

This isn't a scam. I posted their real contact info and the blog post. They stated the the launch degensia.eu  in their blog post before their domain was seized. It wasn't supposed to launch until the 17th. 
Read My original Post:

So I did a little research on this seizure for the last 15 minutes. 
The domain is seized by the same Southern District of NY that issued the seizure of libertyreserve.com. You can see this by doing a reverse lookup on the IP address 74.208.15.160, or by pinging libertyreserve.com and then ecardone.com. 
It looks like they ( have a web server with virtual domain hosting that hosts government seized domains.  If you pull up the different domains (for example:  different splash pages come up depending on the government organizations involved in the investigation/seizure.
Ecardone advertised that they had allowed people to fund their prepaid mastercards for the last 5 years via liberty reserve.  I met them at the conference and they were very specific about being compliant with AML laws and following the Know Your Customer procedures. They photocopied everyone's ID and verified them in person. Their site also required you to jump thru additional hoops to validate your identity if you funded the card beyond certain thresholds. Their AML Verification system was built into their site. So for the record, I'm almost 100% confident that this is all liberty reserve related. 
I really wanted a bitcoin funded credit card. I hope they come back soon and get thru court fine. They appeared to be nice and professional. =(
