I'm just glad we're holding at 6.5k so successfully 
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:43:54
Yep the important thing is the BTC:BCH ratio... for some reason.
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:51:49
Fortunately it's seismically impossible for bitcoin to dip under $6.5k, so we're good
@_date: 2018-09-08 04:28:55
Prices are going up. Even cheap hydro power is increasing since the public utility districts are charging bitcoin miners more.

What you don't realize is a person without bitcoin has no global reach. He can't truly participate in the global markets. Bitcoin is like applying for your passport for the very first time. His whole world opens up and he realizes just how sheltered his life was.

my point is that bitcoin NOT being an income producing asset is one of its strengths. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:43:50
6k imminent! We're back in business!
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:35:10
One of bitcoins greatest strength is that it isn't an income producing asset. It gains value because of it's intrinsic properties (decentralized, trustless, immutable, etc.). Therefore, it operates in a hybrid state where it's both an excellent currency and also an appreciating asset. When you look at it this way, it's actually very beneficial to spend it.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:03:53

Why so much doom and gloom today? I just walked into a random convenience store and paid for my snacks with lightning network. The owner of the store was gushing about how much money he is saving on transaction fees ever since he's started accepting it. Mass adoption is here, people, and the future is BRIGHT.
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:45:59
Wow - is this place dead? Where'd everyone go?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:39:34
As I was chatting to the owner six other people behind me paid for their purchases using LN. This was in a window of probably 10 minutes. By the way, not a single one of them had any issues finding a path to the gas stations node. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:43:10
It only loses value if you sell. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:00:34
No that doesn't sound familiar. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:19:17
I know you're being sarcastic, but I agree with you. When quilt shops (who cater mostly to the elderly) proudly advertise payments accepted via lightning network, you know that we're there. People need to realize that LN isn't some far off fantasy. It's here. It's now. And if people would just open their eyes, they would realize that it's changing the world. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:27:03
I think we will see a solid price run-up leading up to the conference and then steady growth the rest of the year. At these prices you're practically stealing bitcoin. Time to accumulate.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:31:02
I love how people compare bitcoin to beanie babies, not even realizing that there is still a thriving beanie baby market if you know where to look. It's not mainstream anymore, but swap meets, forums, etc. all have enough activity to make a nice living buying and selling beanies. Look up prices on Decade, Tabasco, Peanuts. Enough people snatched up these examples when the market plummeted in the late 90s that they are hard to find aside from a few beanie whales. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:16:22
Hint: Larry is the guy who hodled his bitcoin until the mass adoption event in 2020. He now owns a yacht, three lambos, a nice house, and donates to charity every year. Meanwhile, nocoiners can't even afford a PT Cruiser.

This is what gets me. Bitcoin used to be a cool way to circumvent annoying restrictions like you mentioned. Maybe you're buying digital items, buying some weed or cuban cigars... whatever. It worked **perfectly** well for this at $1 a coin or less.
Now it's all just an endless stream of pump and dumpers, con men, scam artists, vaporware, and doomsayers hoping that the US/EU economies crumble so they can finally be rich.

I started off pretty neutral on bitcoin... then I started reading forums and, omg, you can go into any random thread and find crap like this:
"You really think you're safe from this? Just a matter of time before the big reveal for the rest of us - and you don't want to be holding fiat when it happens."
I really don't care if this guy sells all of his fiat for bitcoin, but when you're trying to convince other people to do the same to bolster your investment I get a little prickly.

A few months ago suggesting that bitcoin could hit $4k would get you shut down real quick. 


There's really not correlation between stocks and bitcoin. 


This is probably why we're seeing bitcoin prices finally settling down to reasonable levels. Just about $4,500 more to go.

Bitcoin's climb up to $1,000 was total market manipulation. There's also some compelling evidence that the climb to $20,000 was just a continuation of that.
At the very least, wait until the DoJ probe concludes and see what happens from there. If they can't find evidence that Tether inflated the markets, I'd feel much better buying at these prices. Otherwise, bitcoin is probably truly worth... $100? $20?
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:10:22

All of the 401ks I've used have had very safe, boring, investments. I think the most extreme has been a Russell 2000 index fund. I highly doubt you are going to fund a single manager who thinks that a bitcoin fund is an appropriate option for their employees. You might say, "oh, why do **they** get to decide what you do with **your** money?". Keep in mind a lot of people have no real interest in learning about investments. This is usually why investment options are safe, boring, broad index funds and target date retirement funds. Your 401k isn't meant for gambling, it's a vehicle to build safe, long-term growth for your retirement.

@_date: 2018-11-19 17:21:25
At the beginning of the year we had people almost forcing capitulation at $15k, $11k, etc. just so they could get back to the new bull run. I guess because they thought that capitulation was something that they needed to complete before prices could go up again. It's funny because it was like "Oooh noooo.... my bitcoins have lost value... I am capitulated... okay, now it's time for a bull run."
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:26:26
Not that I know of. I think Tether's ToS actually states that they're not obligated to redeem USDT for USD. Kraken and maybe one other exchange have a USD/USDT pair which is where I got my price from. Trading is pretty low volume though.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:23:55
This Spring I was doing some light trolling of pretending that I'd cashed out my 401k and went all in on bitcoin. The strangest part was the number of PMs I received advising me not to sell because bitcoin was just experiencing a temporary dip and 100k was right around the corner. This is when it was still at 15k.

Hilarious how predictable this is. When I saw the price was at $4k today, I checked for a tether print and, sure enough, there it was.
Why aren't people taking this seriously? This \_seems\_ like blatant manipulation, and if the DoJ probe turns into anything, we could be looking at another Liberty Reserve situation.

If people treated bitcoin as a high risk gamble I think we're pretty much okay with that.

Well, originally people were saying "oh Bitfinex responds to and processes subpoenas all the time... it might not even have anything to do with Bitfinex or Tether". This seems to confirm that they're actually looking at the link between Tether, Bitfinex, and market manipulation.

You're describing a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:27:40
The disdain for people who bought at 15-20 last year is really interesting. People on here were predicting bitcoin would easily reach 25k, 50k, 100k, even 1m within a few months to a few years. Now in retrospect we can see that that is obviously not the case, but jeez, I wonder how people may have gotten the impression that buying at 20k wasn't bad?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:13:38
I mean... the signs were pretty obvious in December/January of last year. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:04:10
I do all those things, too. What's your point?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:09:24
Sure, so I know what fiat is. Can you tell me what F.I.A.T. is though? Also while you're at it, could you let me know what F.E.D. stands for?

I'm saying that all of the usefulness of bitcoin is still there whether it's $1 a coin or $50,000 a coin. Hardly anyone is actually using bitcoin as a currency, though, so the scarcity does not come from actual usage. It's just pure speculation. 
I think gold is a poor investment, too, but for different reasons.

Jamie Diamond (and the other banksters at JP Morgan &amp; Chase Company) are very anti-bitcoin. If anything, they would pay me to NOT post this material.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:06:23
Bitcoin was manipulated up to $1,000, and I personally think the increase to $20k was due to initial manipulation that gained steam as it went mainstream.
I think the only way we would see $20k again is if there was some major manipulation to increase the price again.
Look at it now: nobody is using bitcoin as a currency. Merchant adoption is decreasing. LN is a far off dream. Bitcoin's only use is people gambling on the price. And even that gamble is going to get boring with more sideways or slowly decreasing price action.
If you're looking to gamble, why not signup for robinhood and try options? It's way easier to gain or lose 100&amp; overnight. :P
@_date: 2018-07-10 15:54:16
I just talked to my stock broker friend again and he said that the big players are turning on the faucets to the institutional money at 2pm SHARP! Jamie Diamond is PISSED and trying to stop this from happening, but he can't do much right now because the board at JP Morgan is keeping a close eye on him since they're thinking of replacing him with a more crypto friendly CEO.
Edit: Downvote all you want, bcashers, but it doesn't change anything.
Edit: When I talked to my friend at "Bitcoinman Sax" he said that under NO CIRCUMSTANCES was anyone on his team going to buy BCASH because it's a huge scam by Roger Ver. They are investing ONLY in Bitcoin.

What are the fees to purchase btc?
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:27:24
Sure, but with Coinbase you're also waiting a week or two for your bank transfer to go through. There's also the case of tons of transfers being "lost", which triggered all of those consumer complaints to the SEC.
Also, you'll need to pay a transaction fee to transfer the bitcoin from your wallet to the exchange you're selling on. Right now it's basically free, but in cases where people are actually using bitcoin (like you're describing), I remember some ridiculous $50 transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:14:02
There's nothing wrong with buying bitcoin as a highly speculative investment, but man, when you're dealing with your retirement how can you be so confident that you're willing to risk your life on it? Think 10, 20, 30, 50 years into the future. S&amp;P500 is still going to be here, doing it's thing... are you sure bitcoin is still going to be a thing? 
A highly diversified mix of stocks and bonds will guarantee that you have something to show for your years of work when you're ready to retire. Take 5&amp; of your income and put it into bitcoin, sure... if it moons, awesome! if it doesn't, oh well, you still have regular investments to fall back on.
Some people thought the Segway was going to replace walking, too, and we know how that turned out.

I just got off the phone with my stock broker friend and he said that a LOT of institutional money is going to be unleashed tomorrow morning. Most institutional stock investors are waiting to see how the levels hold above 6k and since they have been doing well, we can expect several hundred million coming in per day. I can't say where my friend works (except in a few years they might change their name to bitcoinman sax lol) and they have TONS of investors just in their one department that are liquidating their old-school investments (stocks, bonds, CDs, and mutual funds) and going ALL IN on crypto. I talked to him about bcash and he said that nobody on his team was going to invest in it since it's a huge scam by the traitor roger ver, and most people were interested ONLY in bitcoin.
Edit: He also said that a LOT of people in the industry are upset with Jamie Diamond because he was hurting cryptocurrencies. Luckily the board of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Company is considering replacing him with a friendly bitcoin CEO. Stay tuned and I will let you know when I have more information.
Edit 2: Downvote all you want, bcashers, it doesn't change anything.

Thanks everyone for the TREMENDOUS response to my white paper study group. My Wednesday group is full (sorry! I only have about 10 devices that can handle Skype) but a few people have suggested another idea which I think is great.
I'm going to be starting a weekly community meeting where we can discuss bitcoin, study the white paper, and organize community outreach projects. So in addition to our Wednesday night white paper study, we'll also have a group meeting on Sunday morning. I'm looking for a place to host this now (I'm thinking we can rent a space in a strip mall cheaply and easily).
If anyone has suggestions for our activities I would LOVE to hear them! So far I'm very interested in organizing some outreach ideas:
\- Door to door canvassing. Maybe there are some teens or young adults that could do this during the day?
\- Let's organize a group project to help build blockchain infrastructure in countries that are less fortunate. I'm thinking Haiti, South America, or parts of Africa?
\- For people unable to do door to door canvassing, let's print some pamphlets we can leave on people's windshields, in their mailbox, at bus stops, etc. Let's spread the word!
This is super exciting. Let's DO THIS!

oh yah, this boost is great. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:26:31
Nobody is really using LN yet aside from a few early adopters testing it out. How has bitcoin's infrastructure changed since December/January to allow permanently low fees?
The only reason why you paid a nickel per transaction is because nobody is actually using bitcoin anymore. Re-introduce the activity from early this year and we're right back to $50 transaction fees.

Are we just guessing? I don't know enough about the inner workings of a stock exchange to refute this, but that also means that I know I'm not qualified to offer solutions to problems that I don't fully understand.

Hmm okay - so, back to the Ferrari example:
A Ferrari requires hundreds of ours of skilled labor, exotic materials, etc. and in the end you get a sweet, cutting edge sports car.
Bitcoin also requires hundreds of hours of skilled programming, tons of electricity, mining hardware, etc... and in the end, you get a bitcoin.
Which you can... do what with? Store it, hoping you can sell it to somebody else for more fiat later on? 
If bitcoin is a product the way that a Ferrari is, why was Bitcoin worth 20k a coin not too long ago?
The best use for bitcoin so far has been buying drugs and other shady stuff off the internet. This worked just fine when bitcoin was $20 a coin, too.
The spike to $20k a coin was just because everyone FOMO'd because they'd heard stories of people getting rich and didn't want to miss out.
Bitcoin is pretty much the most fiat of the fiat currencies.

So these guys got fined by the SEC, but this gives you an idea how how much volume we're dealing with. This is from just one high frequency trader: Citadel 'sent multiple, periodic bursts of order messages, at 10,000 orders per second, to the exchanges.

Sure, but this idea that people are so sick and tired of their money losing value since 1913 and they _just don't know what to do!_ is so tired. There's nothing wrong with buying bitcoin but let's be honest with ourselves, ya know? It's a gamble and people are buying it because they're hoping it'll make them rich. Nothing wrong with that.

@_date: 2018-07-01 22:33:20
Following your example, bitcoin is the product that people are purchasing with fiat, right? Just like people buying ferraris are converting their money into cars.
A new Ferrari requires hundreds of hours of skilled labor to design, engineer, and assemble. It also requires lots of materials sourced from around the world.
A bitcoin is a form of currency that was created out of thin air. Sure, it's limited, but that doesn't mean it's backed by anything or any more valid than fiat currency.

For sure. I remember back in 1992 people got really excited about the internet and it's all everyone was talking about. Of course, there was a minor setback in 1993 when everyone lost interest, websites went offline, and ISPs were going out of business left-and-right due to lack of demand. Luckily they turned it around just in time for the late 90s .com mania.

Yeah, I love the internet argument. Even after the .com bubble burst people were still using it everyday to buy things, chat, play games, email, read news, whatever...
The internet never had a time when its userbase or growth just disappeared overnight. People didn't have to be convinced to use it, or educated on the evils of... traditional publishing systems. As soon as they used it, the potential was pretty obvious.

Submitting the documents and waiting for an exchange to confirm your identity and process your ACH payment is much more time consuming than creating a basic IRA.

Are you calling bitcoin antiquated?
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:19:40
Good luck. It's a nice thought, but in my opinion completely misguided and detached from reality.

If you haven't already, PLEASE comment on the proposed Bitcoin ETF that the SEC is considering. Here is a comment that has already been submitted that you can use for inspiration:
"I strongly support the proposal of Bitcoin ETF.
In December because of SEC approval of Futures, Bitcoin went up from $3K to $20K. we again need SEC help to make money for small retail investors who lost lot of money in last 7 months. ETF has potential to take the price of Bitcoin from $6K to $30K in few days and that can start the new crypto cycle and help US economy during these trade wars.
ETF will be the great news for US economy. crypto is the future and US can lead the world by allowing ETF.Crypto Investors around the world is eagerly waiting for SEC to approve it and support this revolution."

I think with an bitcoin ETF we could easily see another 1-2&amp; added to the GDP.

Just gotta keep buying the dips all the way down, kinda like bitcoin.

LN is the future. Bullish!
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:59:35
And in this sub, most people just care about the price. No one actually uses it for anything besides sitting on an exchange, hoping the value will increase.

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with my stock broker friend and he said that the everyone at bitcoinman sax is FREAKING OUT right now. Apparently Jamie Diamond threatened to fire everyone if they invested in bitcoin and people are scared. He can't keep the lid on this forever, though, and there is already an underground resistance fomenting. Most traders on my friends team are planning on investing in bitcoin secretly but they have to do this after work otherwise they might get fired by Jamie Diamond. My friend said that most people in his office are home by 5:30pm so we can expect to see a large boost at that time. Some people are even plotting to see how they can get home faster than other people on their team so they can buy in first before the price spikes, LOL! Apparently it's all over Wall Street as a big middle finger to Jamie Diamond.
Edit: GS stock is DOWN today on this news! Investors will not have it!
Edit 2: It looks like tons of GS investors are selling their stock to invest in bitcoin directly. Jamie Diamond can't stop them all.

Bitcoin isn't something that you invest in... It's a gamble, which is fine, but it's a gamble.

Definitely. Same reason why people sign-up for MLMs, ponzis, and other such schemes.

Current technology isn't the limiting factor in settlement times, though:


The SEC just moved from T+3 to T+2. Even with blockchain (assuming it could handle the number of transaction that are needed) we would still be at T+2 until the SEC changed the rules.
What's the theoretical maximum transaction limit of Bitcoin? Like 11 transactions a second? How do you think a system like that is going to cope with ALL trades handled in a single stock exchange. I'm willing to bet just one or two high frequency traders ALONE would completely saturate the system.

I just love how much bitcoin relies on pulling in more bagholders to support its price. Take this post and replace bitcoin with any number of scammy investments and it reads the same.

If only there were some way to grow your money over time. Perhaps even at a rate that outpaces inflation. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:47:10
No, nothing like a bailout. Bitcoin has a fixed supply (new coins CANNOT be minted). Please read the white paper.

Risk isn't necessarily correlated with higher returns. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 20:05:56
The government shouldn't have the ability to deny this. The people want it to happen. It's not a bail out. Please read the white paper before you make these arguments.
