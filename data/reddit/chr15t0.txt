[This]( is as far as I have got so far. Certain characters have not been correctly aligned, deliberately. If you zoom in, you can see the misalignment.
    =cllkskpo2i257Wlleepudso0eaxGBWisl
    or
    =cllkskpo2i257Wlleeudso0eaxGBWisl
    Wasn't sure of the 'p', hence the 'or'
    Went clockwise around the circle to get char order,
    I doubt this has any bearing on the solution

I read that with a pinch of salt... It appears as if his advice is to help *him* maintain *his* fortune, and help it flourish further. If others can find theirs in other ways by being open minded *might be a generalisation*, what's the problem. I remember BTC being under £1 and selling at a ridiculous %, then reinvesting a set amount in altcoins and altcoin opportunities including an ATM in Germany, but taking my initial investment back. Perhaps he is bitter about not getting involved like the rest of us? He supposedly a bit of a legend, but if I'm honest, if you don't understand it, how can you advise others on it? If I want help programming a multi level finite state machine in c++, my grandma is the last person I'm going to call... I don't know enough about the other advice he gave, and I'm sure it was gold, but I, unlike him, won't pass comment on how he advises others in bridling their finances. *sorry*
