I feel your pain!
Told my Cow-orkers to buy Bitcoin at $100 usd, years ago. They laughed at me, told me I was a moron for believing in Ponzi schemes.  I handed in my 2-week resignation notice when BTC hit $5,000 a couple of months back. When I got to the parking lot, there were half a dozen wankers waiting for me. Some wanted me to give away some of my bitcoins because it was only "fair" others threatened to bit me up because I thought I was "too smart"!

If you print infinite money, you drive your fiat to its intrinsic value of $0. Creditors will simply stop accepting your worthless funny money and countries will give your shit coin the finger.  Even now, Oil producing nations are moving away from the dollar and those trillions floating around the world are destined to come back home.  Helloooo hyper inflation!!!

You don't lose if you don't sell your BTC. That simple.

Did you see the video?  That is Ramon Lobo speaking, no CGI.  That is an official event. As clear as day. Are you implying that an event is only real if CNN reports about it?
