I recently started dabbling into dogecoin and bitcoin. 
My SO asked me how many dogecoins I have, and I said "4-ish". He asked if that was a lot and I giggled and just said that his friend that mentioned having 300,000 of them had about $200 usd worth. 
Takes a whole lotta dogecoin to make a usd, but damn if it isn't a fun community :) 
Edit: also, for anyone wanting to get into cryptocurrancy, I'd recommend starting with dogecoin because the community has been very welcoming, supportive, and they ELI5 without making me feel inferior or overwhelmed by everything. It'll really open your eyes to how cryptocurrancy works, and what it is. [There's also this video that helped me out a lot](

Would someone mind ELI5? (How tipping works, what the difference between dogecoin and bitcoin are, and how can I participate?)

Thanks! I'm going to look into all of this later tonight! Just reading over what you replied with, and looking over some of the it looks/sounds *really* interesting and not  as difficult to understand as I thought it would be. (Cryptocurrencies have been/are really intimidating, mostly because it's so new to me.)  Thanks for the tip(s) and your kind response. If I have any questions I'll totally send you a message :)
