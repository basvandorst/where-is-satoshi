If a government attacked bitcoin like that, I'd take it as a personal attack.  As such, I'd would hurt China, far more than they'd cost me in Bitcoin losses. 
However, day one. in order to help with the difficulty "hump", I think a general call to temporarily turn on all hashpower, even if at a loss would happen. All my GPU's mining Ethereum, would be mining bitcoin. Yeah, it'd be a drop in the bucket, but if I and old S3's, etc... turned on. I also would delay making bitcoin transaction until difficulty readjustment. 
Also the blocks would like have very large transaction fees attached as the backlog built, I wouldn't be surprised to see a block with more fees than the block reward in such a scenario.

More users should naturally push the price up. See there are a finite amount of bitcoins, more people wanting them means more bid pressure, which means higher price. Unless you are speaking of useless amounts like .01. I don't even consider them users.

I have a small solar array and batteries, and researched the shit out of it, it's not going to make economic sense to fully transition without a better means of energy storage. Sure solar and wind will without a doubt offset a lot of the demand going forward, but it's delusional to think it'll happen in a decade.

Bitcoin is basically a single function "thing". It is there to secure the accounting of "bitcorns". There are relatively simple mechanism to do other things like time delay a transaction, or require multiple signers, but still they're related to accounting not for example protein folding, and they really aren't "complicated" functions other than making sure they work across the whole network reliably . There is nothing wrong with that. You can simply make an external service to run a process upon receiving bitcoin, Isolating Functions is more secure and easier to maintain anyway.

non pure speculative buying and selling is real. 
Example: Until the fee situation went full retard, I did every couple of months actually use my bitcoin to buy things, mostly computer stuff on newegg. So, like buying a 200-400 dollar video card or something. Now, I don't even consider using bitcoin for any purchase, as it's like throwing 20-30 bucks away for nothing. I just use my credit card or paypal. 
so, my holding of bitcoin has now transmorphed into purely holding it for speculation, it has no real world daily use anymore for me. I do not consider 200 dollar purchases Spam. 
So, while I'm a unwilling participant in the pure speculation game, all new comers at this point are purely in it for speculation or they are ignorant of the current state of bitcoin, as there is no real world use in bitcoin at this time beyond speculation for most people, the fees are retarded, and even with high fees the odds of getting in a block are highly variable. It could take hours even with a high fee. 
While I detest Ver, and BCash, it's not because they want larger blocks, moreso in the over the top aggressiveness of the increase. Bitcoin does need and should have regular blocksize increases, like 15-20 percent per year. It's just as unreasonable to have the current situation as it is to go from 1MB to 8MBs. 
YEah, I know "segwit" and "lightning", great... so far Segwit has been the most epic nothing burger in the history of crypto, and lightning is forever 18 months away, and will not address the issue for years, as you have to get retailers, users, exchanges, etc... to use it to before it works well. That won't happen overnight. So, the current state of bitcoin disfunction is likely to last at least a year, and only be suitable for speculation that in the future bitcoin might be useful again.

@_date: 2018-01-08 05:00:24
Because lightning type proposals will take years after they launch to even matter. 1. you have to get the retailer to use lightning. 2. you have to get end users to use lightning. 3. you have to get the software done in such a way it is one click essentially to use lightning. 4. Even after lightning is widely adopted by the current user base, you'll still need larger base layer blocks if we want to facilitate more than a trivial number of "real" bitcoin users. And yeah a million or 2 is a pathetic number compared to 7 billion people worldwide. 
I mean seriously, Segwit isn't even average user usable in the core wallet, and it's been months since that got activated, and they had like a year to prepare. IF you think lightning will have any substantial effect on transaction capacity in 2018, you're smoking the good stuff. 
Segwit hasn't to this day and second, had any substantial effect on network transaction capacity. Why would I or anyone assume lightning which requires building essentially a new network on top of the old network have a faster uptake by the bitcoin ecosystem. All the hostile actors will still be hostile, so scrap coinbase and bitpay from using it until they absolutely must.
Nope, the new paradigm in crypto, is a large number of the participants like coinbase and bitpay, etc.. are actively trying to kill off bitcoin, that won't change, and since many of those companies are responsible for a substantial amount of the network activity, they can hamper any voluntary advancements for a very long time or forever if they succeed. 
So, no lightning will fix absolutely nothing in reality for years at minimum, and maybe never. 
A hardfork however, that increased the blocksize x percent a year, would happen, if supported by the devs, the overwhelming vast majority of users would support it, and the miners would look absolutely hypocritical if they opposed a blocksize increase after they supported it in the past. Once that happened Coinbase, bitpay etc... obviously would have no choice but to use the new improved bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:02:16
you could just install bitcoin core on a different machine with a larger hard drive and export the wallet from the old computer. 
You really should back up your wallet files at minimum. And don't delete anything either on the old drive in the bitcoin folder. 
You can import the keys from bitcoin core to other programs but I've never done it. 
I've moved the wallet to a different machine before though.

@_date: 2018-01-26 06:12:11
Fees won't drop to nothing, the blockspace even with full segwit support,will be inadequate for more than a trivial amount of users to use lightning. As in if you want a million people using lightning you need space for 2 million onchain bitcoin transactions. So, lightning won't get us to a non-trivial user base, maybe a few million (just a guess), no where near a 100 million real users. As for one not everyone will use lightning for their transactions. Hostile parties will also not integrate. AKA coinbase.

No they don't, all leftist forms of thought revolve around a powerful central authority. Socialism, Communism both rely on a goobermint in control of huge portions of the economy to the whole of the economy. At least in real world practice they do, I know some leftists think the massive state control is only needed temporarily to transition to the "true" communist utopia later, but when has any powerful organization ceded power willingly once gained. 
In the real world the left always wants more power for the state. They wrap that in heart tugging causes, like healthcare, or child welfare, but the end result is using the government to enforce their will on the population.

Sure the reward for saving in bitcoin would be greater than the reward for saving in present USD, but people will spend anyway, some may not buy so much junk, which if you hate the planet likely will upset you(generic you), but reducing consumption is a good thing as long you can still have the essentials, and no one would stop the dude bro from buying a Harley and all leather outfit to pretend badass, or the micropenis man from buying a lambo, or the narcissistic woman from buying a 300 dollar pair of jeans.

As the "marketcap" of bitcoin grows, the amount it rises will likely be less percentage wise than previous cycles. So, maybe 50% was a standard for a crash a few years ago, but volatility should decrease as the pool of holders increases, so what 25% now would be a crash?, At 40K 10%? etc.... We won't be having yearly 1000% price increases forever, I actually doubt bitcoin will ever do that again in a single year. A crash is a relative extreme drop in value.

Dear generous benefactor. I am an overweight single white middle aged male. I have worked hard my whole life, working towards a dream, however, it does not appear I can achieve it without your help. I desperately need. 
You see, since I was young I dreamed of a 3 way with 2 asian prostitutes, and the joy supplemented with an ounce of pure cocaine. I dream not of street walkers, but of high quality model level prostitutes!, and the purest of cocaine! However, while I could afford a hour or two, I dream of a week of debauchery unseen by man before, we're talking plugging all ports multiple times a day, ass licking, ball sucking, fisting, etc... By now you must understand the beauty of my dream. I think if I were able to achieve my dream with your help, it would serve as an inspiration to all the middle aged males of the world that goodness and hope still exist in this world, and no matter how dark it may seem there is still hope that a generous person will bring light back into their world. So, maybe they'll hold on one more day. 
Thank you.

Youtube constantly manipules trending videos to promote or suppress videos that don't match their worldview. It gives a false impression of what is the "popular" opinion and culture.

If bitcoin ever took off I could see it evolving to a point where mining was "unprofitable" for everyone. 
As in Power companies could use mining as a way to recoup a portion of their cost associated with excess capacity. They wouldn't want to mine necessarily but might as opposed to just wasting power. Plop semi truck trailers full of asics next to the nuclear power plant, and turn off and on a rack at a time via automated systems. 
Or a Solar or Wind installation may have some miners that determine if they'd make more mining versus selling electricity back to the grid. If the Chips could be powered and depowered rapidly they could be used to smooth out the spikes. 
Large businesses might mine simply to ensure a the system does not concentrate. 
If miners got to a point were improvements in the asics became very slow, then solutions for using them to simply generating heat become possible, as in partial offset only applications.  Maybe large stores would use the Bitcoin Furnace 40Kilowatt module to heat the store. 
You'll also always have individuals that will mine at loss just to "help" the system as well.  
Anyway, I think as ASIC advances become smaller and smaller we'll eventually hit a point were it becomes unprofitable for all and people do it for other reasons mostly as a way to minimize "loss". Like a heater doesn't "make" you money if it's mining bitcoins it could just pay for 80% of the electricity and still make sense to do it. No profit to be had just offsetting the cost of heating.

Actually in my case, my coinbase bitcoin purchases are a small fraction compared to my mining bitcoins. I also traded elsewhere and made some bitcoin.

THe miners or the utility? IF you mean the utility, that wouldn't complete solve the issue, part of the issue is the capacity of the wires and transformers themselves. 1 It's hot so everything is harder to keep in a safe temperature zone, and 2 wires only carry so much before they start losing more and more to resistance, and that turns to heat which then leads to breakdowns. 
IF the miners installed battery banks sure that'd help but it's not really economical at the moment.

He's kinda right, there isn't one singlular solution. It's segwit adoption, lightning, rational systematic blocksize increase, better more efficient code. 
There isn't one solution. Lightning requires more onchain transaction capacity if bitcoin is to support an order of magnitude increase in users, it just will.

Don't know, I think it largely depends on getting larger transaction capacity online before then, as in if Segrated Witness, and or larger transaction blocks and or lightning and or other improvements happen the larger the growth optimism will become, and that should translate into ultimately a higher price. 
If we got all those things, and the halving, well I'm in a public place and trying not to think about it as it's not appropriate to get a raging boner in public. So, I'll end it there. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 02:21:08
I think what it does is move some stuff out of the "block" and place it in it's own "sideblock". The stuff moved out is basically signatures, and the sideblock maintains the same structure as the primary block. 
The stuff moved out of the block and placed in the sideblock, basically composed 3/4 of the block data. So a 1 MB primary block could now hold 4 times the transactions as previous. The sideblock holding the data no longer stored in the primary block would need to be 3MBs to facilitate the data move into it. 
So, you still have 1MB blocks that are currently limited by the code and would require a hardfork to change, however that 1MB block now hold 4 times the transactions, and the sideblock is 3MB. So effectively a 4MB block equivalent to the current method of storing blocks.

@_date: 2015-12-02 09:38:05
Seems to me that is the actual problem with bitcoin, far more important than anything else. 
Essentially that leads to a situation where there are only a few miners really controlling the whole network, and since all these ASICS are made in CHINA, then it's inevitable (under the current ASIC friendly bitcoin) that will be controlled by a few people. 
Why is that not the primary concern rather than worrying about a fee market, or tor friendliness, as mining centralization is the end of bitcoin as opposed to a problem with "orphans", or not being capable of running a full node in china over tor. 
Seems to me we need a hard fork changing POW to an asic resistant system or else bitcoin is dead eventually.

Social Contract. You mean like sending money to foreign countries. You mean like supporting a military likely 3 times to big if we stuck to the premise that it is for "defending" the United States, Also where is it listed that government is supposed to force us to pay into a shitty retirement scheme "social security" or medicare. 
I'd like to see the terms of this social contract, as I'm over 40 now, and I've not benefited from this contract in proportion to my contribution to it. And I can't see any possible way, I'll ever break even on it either. 
Sure, I'd have no problem paying for roads, okay police coverage, fire department, a rationally sized military. However, to pay for those things would only require a fraction of what the current tax rate is, likely sub 10% state and federal tax combined.

Well, there is a limiter there, so bitcoin won't even double from here most likely until the transaction capacity is increased. 
So, essentially, bitcoin right now is periodically becoming a hassle to use because of the 1MB blocks. So, in order for that FED prediction to hold we'd have to double the blocks every 8 months, that's not going to happen, so it won't be doubling like they predicted. It could have but we got to protect the blocksize for like reasons. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:11:27
You can make as many transactions as you want provided you have enough BTC for the fees. So, if you spam the network with 1000's of transactions, you could push all the normal transaction to the side, or a lot of them anyway, and make the network take forever to confirm those "normal" transaction, and if you did that long enough, it's unknown what the ultimate effect would be. 
I'm pretty sure it'd take more than 2 BTC/day push out most of the "real" transactions though. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:49:09

Tor wasn't built for bitcoin and bitcoin wasn't built for tor. Why we'd use another project as a metric for bitcoin is beyond me. Tor will always be a generation or more behind present bandwidth availablity on the main net. So, to say let's make Bitcoin Tor bound is saying, let's keep bitcoin work on the internet of today-6 years. It's absurd. 
Seriously crazy talk like this will send bitcoin to 10.00 bucks, and turn off the 99% of the world that don't use tor nor care to use tor. 
FYI: We won't win anything by hiding in the shadows, we aren't doing anything wrong, well I'm not. You don't win a war by hiding forever. We should say here we are, we want to use this we will use this, if using bitcoin is so horrifying to the government then throw us in jail. That's my stance. Ban it .gov, I'll still run my node.

That attitude is why people sat at the woolworths lunch counter, that is why people faced a line of state troopers and attack dogs, because they were right and weren't going to hide like bitches anymore.

I really wish people would stop pretending advocates of larger blocks think it will get us to 7B users worth of transaction capabilities. 
Actually I think moving to larger blocks just allows bitcoin to scale from the commerce of a "small" town worth of transactions to a medium sized town worth of transactions. 
It simply gives bitcoin more room to grow, while miners are being hyper subsidized by block rewards. Larger blocks and the fees from the larger number of transactions are going to be required to support mining in the future anyway. 
I've absolutely no problem for low value transaction being handled offchain by changtip and the like. I've no objection to developing sidechains for new applications or the lightning network. 
Increasing the blocksize simply allows more room to grow in the next couple years. That's it, the 7Billion user problem still exists, and should be worked on.

So, don't sidechains mean higher costs then. As if I purchased directly with BTC on the main chain, then it's over with. If I move btc to a sidechain (fee) then to purchase something I would incur another fee. 
Presumably fees inside the sidechain will be cheaper, but then that means constantly having a balance in the sidechain. And if one sidechain doesn't handle all sidechain transactioins, then I have to pay more fees, to either move sidechain A coin to sidechain B coin, or I'd have to move back to BTC (fee) then from BTC (fee) to sidechain B then actually pay (fee). 
Anyway, doesn't sound pleasant.

Okay I do run a full node to support the network. 
I do that because I use the network. 
If there comes a point were I can't use the "actual" bitcoin network for purchases I want to make, I'd no longer run a full node. 
Small blocks lead to excessive fees over time if usage increases, therefore small blocks over time remove the final incentive to run a full node. I wouldn't run servers for banks for free.
Now, for sub 1.00 purchases yeah, go do that using some other system (people rarely use any electronic method for that anyway), but fees shouldn't make even 5.00 dollar purchases impractical, IMO.

4. Watch bitcoin price 4x in price in days.

That's not quite true, that 5000 number is based on "reachable" nodes.

If bitcoin ever really catches on, it'll require people to sell to new users anyway. I'm not a whale, but if all coins were mined, and everyone had as many coins as me less than a million people worldwide could own any bitcoin!. So... yeah, I'll sell "some" when prices hit certain levels I've made up for myself.
However, it's unlikely I'll sell it all, unless the price surges like crazy quickly without supporting developments. 
You also have to remember. If let's say bitcoin hit 50K, and I sold 10% of my coins. Well, that fiat isn't going to be spent instantly and if bitcoin were to sharply dive, well, I'd likely buy back my sold coins, so it helps form a floor on price as well.

I look at my bandwidth usage, and at present it is like sporadically 1 Megabit of my my connection upload 99% of the time. 
In your bitcoin.conf file you can set max connections to like 20, and reduce your bandwidth usage. I wouldn't set it much lower than 20, the less connections you have the less you would actually be "helping". 
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:15:50
Edited to add: I'm already running a full node.
You know  isn't fully accurate in terms of how many "nodes" are running in a capacity greater than default 8 connections configuration, if you are running a node with a max connections set to like 50, and you have 50 connections, it won't show your node on there as "reachable". 
I just did the test, so in all probability the node count is a good fraction higher than that states. 
Try it, set max connections to like 10, and wait until they are full, and then test if your connection is reachable, obviously it won't be because it won't respond to more than your max connections, and therefore you won't be added to the node count total. 
That seems to be where people are getting their node counts from.

It's because the devs think that bitcoin is here to serve as a mechanism to provide miners with fees. 
The chinese miners with there 3 cent electricity don't want it because of bandwidth concerns. I really don't care if some miner selects to set up shop in a mountain next to a hydro plant doesn't have a fiber connection. I don't have 3 cent electricity but can get a better internet connection. Somehow the only concern is "bandwidth", and no discussion of the centralization that is caused by electricity cost. 
So, essentially bitcoin devs are controlling 1 factor "bandwidth", and ignoring the main cause of centralized mining. "electricity" cost. 
They are in love with their lightning non-existant product which they are going to force into bitcoin core. 
I'm about tired of this, really, I won't buy another bitcoin as long as the current biased devs are running the show. I would sell it all, except for the small hope that the current devs go away, maybe they'll get jobs at banks or some place more aligned with their philosophies and give up their self appointed position as "protector" of the fees, and central authority on "bandwidth".

Doesn't all this sidechain and lightning network talk presume that all the exchanges, payment processors, etc... will go rewrite their systems to support it. Seems like a HUGE assumption. 
Also, explaining to a newbie. The first thing you do is buy BTC, then you send that BTC to this thing called Lightning Network for a specified amount of time, and during that time you will be able to transact on the lightning network with it, but when you send it there you'll have to pay, and when you get it back to "regular" btc there will be a fee, oh and yeah some merchants well they just take standard btc, and others support both, and a few just support lightning now, so be sure to check first. Just don't worry about understanding why you got to send it all over the place to buy a router, this is the glorious future of complicated multi-tiered btc cached, Sidechained Lightning Blockchain technology!!!!!

Run a full node for awhile and look at your bandwidth usage. 
My connection could not handle sustained 20MB blocks. But it probably will be able to in a couple years. Just changing the max BlockSize doesn't mean the blocks will be 20MB any time soon. Most likely that wouldn't happen for several years. 
Right now we are at 1MB blocks and some of the blocks aren't full, so I ask why does everyone assume we'd hit 20MB as soon as we made the switch, most likely we wouldn't until 2017-2018 or later. 
By then I'm sure my upload will have gone up significantly, they tend to upgrade every couple of years around here.
I'd be perfectly happy with a compromise less than 20MB. I'd be totally satisfied with 8 MB blocks.  I'd accept 5 Megabyte blocks even.

1. Acquire BTC.
2. Send BTC to something else (FEE).
3. Use other solution to pay for something (FEE)&gt;
4. Send Remaining amount of "other solution" units back to standard BTC (FEE). 
Looks like a fee generation "dream" and user nightmare. 
Plus all those "other solutions" are supported by 0 merchants, payment processors and not integrated into any wallet at this time. So, essentially Complete and total system upgrade is required. 
Yep... that's not going to cause any problems. 
Plus, it just complicates everything, as in you must know what "other solution" is accepted by the retailer or service you want to buy from in the "other solution" scenarios. 
Sure those "other solutions" have their place, but so does raising the block size well before those "other solutions" are complete.

Naw, just more block blocking from the Peter. 
Lightning doesn't work in a practical sense people. 
In order to use lightning you have to pay a fee to send btc to and from lightning, then pay a fee inside lightning for those transactions. So, in order for you to come out ahead using lightning, you'd need in theory to do 3 transactions inside lightning, before you pull your coins back out. 
My present usage of bitcoin, would mean I'd have to lock up an indeterminant amount of bitcoin inside lightning for  several months to gleen any advantage to using it. I purchase stuff with bitcoin 1-2 times a month on average, and I don't know in advance what it is I'm going to buy, it's more of a spur of the moment thing when the bitcoin option is available. So, using lightning to do that, would incur 3 fees, where as before there was one. 
Lightning is nothing. Neg if you want, don't care, it's  non-solution.

I didn't say anything about how the energy was made. The point is out of the whole of planet Earth, there are only a few dozen at most places that can compete with .03 cent electricity, which means bitcoin will drift towards an oligarchy, unless something changes that tendency. 
Maybe solar will continue to drop in price and lower the electricity price. Who knows but as is, there will be less and less miners henceforth, and larger and larger miners huddled around these cheap electric sources. 
Also, damns aren't good for the environment, FYI, there are plenty of docs on youtube if you want to enlighten yourself. They disrupt the ecology of areas, and endanger fish populations. I'm not saying we shouldn't have them, but they aren't "green" as much as you probably think.

I don't see a problem with it necessarily if they included that at the time the contract is signed. 
It wouldn't be that bad for the miners really. I'm on a variable price plan for my electricity so it varies based on demand, or in other words the price goes crazy when you have abnormally hot temps. So, the exact days my price spikes would be the days they would want to cut their power. I voluntarily shut all my rigs down during such periods as not to pay insane rates, but I do get lower rates like 95% of the time than all my neighbors on standard fixed rate plans. So, I come out ahead even with idle time. Also, shutting down my rigs when it's 97 degrees outside and the cooling is most stressful is a good time to do maintenance.
Generally, they'd be forced to shutdown like 8 hours on those extra hot days, as peak demand doesn't extend overnight or in the morning. So, they could expect like 10 days during the summer to be forced to have partial day shutdown. 
Not bad really considering they are getting excellent rates otherwise and they are told the day before when such an event will happen based on weather reports for the next day. The electric provider will be happy as having the ability to shutdown a big chunk of demand during unusually hot days will help them tremendously, and the miners could partially offset the damage by scheduling maintence tasks during such times, like cleaning, upgrading, inspecting, installing/replacing etc...
But I do think the utility should do that during negotiations for the contract, not impose it willy nilly.

1. No shit government has killed 100's of millions, and the only reason they stop is because people fight them. Tor is hiding. 
2. Yeah, no shit gov watches people what's your point, you think you are "hiding", they ship hard drives, cpu's with built in backdoors, you live in a fantasy land if you think you are actually hidden. 
3. Tor requires exit nodes, which the government can shutdown, Sure they can't get every single one, but they can make tor almost useless at will, ceertainly slow enough to choke off bitcoin traffic.
4. I download and verified the full blitcoin blockchain a couple months ago after a node crashed and it took like 8 hours, your 30 second claim would likely only be true on a raspberry pi. 
5. Bitcoin is a peer to peer global currency for everyone to use if they want to. 1MB blocks by the limited transaction potential violate that principle and relegate it to a fraction of 1 percent of the global population.
6. I don't care about the Silk Road nor Dread Pirate Roberts. I don't do drugs, though I do think they should be legal for adults.

Paper gold is equivalent to offchain transactions which is essentially fake bitcoin. So, it's not gold. 
Changetip is fake Bitcoin, they simply promise to pay real bitcoin if you cash out, so is Coinbase, so are exchanges. It's not "Real" bitcoin if you don't actually control it. It's a promissory note for real bitcoin. 
So, yes it can happen in bitcoin, and it did happen in bitcoin on mt gox, when people were trading gox bitcoin and thinking gox had enough real bitcoin to back it up.

If a bitcoin full node requires it to be hosted in a datacenter we already would have a significant userbase, at which point .gov would be very reluctant to fuck over. We aren't there, or even near there, and won't be for years. There are more and more gigabit connections every year, it doesn't cost much for a used computer and I saw on newegg yesterday a 1TB harddrive for 40 Bucks. 4
I don't accept global tyranny you people that hide in shadows do though, you run and hide forever. Ever notice most of the changes in the world come about from people confronting their adversary.

Protection comes from a large number of users we are no where near the user count required to make bitcoin immune from .gov simply banning it on a whim, and while that may not "kill" it in a technical sense, it would in an economic sense. 
The total focus should be on wide scale adoption, not on protecting fees, or devs shitty internet connections.

You, I and every user add to the value of bitcoin. 
If backlogged transactions and skyrocketing fees are the destiny of bitcoin, I will surely help resolve that situation by cashing out, that would require someone else buying my coins to hold the relative value stable. 
It doesn't have a fundamental value in terms of purchasing power, that is wholly a function of people buying and selling it. More people leads to more potential demand, which means higher relative value. 
A 1 MB blockchain, with hobbled on sidechain solution means sub 100 dollar bitcoin in a couple years max less nodes, and less user base. IMO.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:34:55
Okay I do run a full node to support the network. 
I do that because I use the network. 
If there comes a point were I can't use the "actual" bitcoin network for purchases I want to make, I'd no longer run a full node. 
Small blocks lead to excessive fees over time if usage increases, therefore small blocks over time remove the final incentive to run a full node. I wouldn't run servers for banks for free.
Now, for sub 1.00 purchases yeah, go do that using some other system (people rarely use any electronic method for that anyway), but fees shouldn't make even 5.00 dollar purchases impractical, IMO.

Doubt it. The problem with the million tokens for every commercial application is .............. accounting........ and... security ....... and .... storage.  It's a pain in the ass, and while only having one or two coins isn't that big of a deal, having 40 of these coins all varying in value, and subject to capital gains on every transaction potentially, it turns into a nightmare. Unless of course you simply use a centralized repository for all your coins, and they implement an accounting system for you, but then you aren't really using the coin at all, but rather trusting they actually have your coins, and securing them, etc.... etc... 
I don't really buy the whole idea of companies each issuing their gimmick coins, it's kinda stupid if you ask me. But people into alts like stupid non-useful functions so it'll probably work to some degree.

What, I actually asked one of the 1MB trolls, if they'd accept even 3 MB increase, and they said no. 
I've read the text of the convo Gavin had with the Chinese miners and they seemed to think 8 MB would be okay. Go, ask the core devs if they will accept 8 MB, they'll say nope.
As far as my understanding 20MB was an initial proposal, I've seen those that desire an increase propose compromising for less, the 1MBers seem intent to wait until the blocks are full, and there is a steady backlog before their "graces" allow a change. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:18:05
They could issue all citizens a single bitcoin address per person, and business. Then blacklist all other addresses making their use punishable by 30 years in prison. Then they can track in real time where the citizens are spending their bitcoins. 
Once that system is tested they can ban cash, credit cards, etc... and make all commerce in the borders a 100% trackable, and they will know almost everything about you. 
Got to do it to stop terrorists.

I decided the corruption of governments and financial systems was to much for one man to take, so I decided to change the world's financial system. So, I thought about it while taking a poop and then after looking down at my offspring I noticed it kind had dents in it at regular intervals like a chain. I had the eureka moment of a lifetime, that's it! I professed as staring at my blocky chain of poo. A blockchain on the internet. The chain of blocks would be limited to a set frequency like my poos, and the input (food) required to make the blocks (poo), might be greater or less but still remain fairly consistent timewise. 
After that it kinda just fell in place. miners are just a replacement for intestines, etc... I just wish the bitcoin code was as clean as the dump was, nothing even came off when I wiped. Apparently I'm a better shitter than a coder.  
Now, you know the dirty truth about how the basic idea of bitcoin emerged. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:12:05
Consensus among the larger players is impossible, because some of the core devs have stated explicitly they won't even consider raising the block size until transactions are backlogged regularly. 
Also what does consensus even mean? Is it a consensus of core devs? Is it a consensus of core devs, and miners? Is it a consensus of core dev, miners, exchanges, payment gateways?  Is it a consensus of everyone that hold some bitcoins? 
Consensus is meaningless. Because the only way that Consensus will be possible is if it is determined by core devs, and possibly large miners, which then makes this an oligarchy of a dozen or so that decide the fate of all.
Oligarchy=Centralized. 
If it's consensus for all the users, well that doesn't work either, because if it's up to me, I 100% oppose any change made to bitcoin that will facilitate the lightning network or sidechains. So, permanent deadlock. 
But we all know "consensus" just means the core devs. So, why keep playing this act?

Why bitcoin isn't that complicated to use. All it needs is easier methods of securing it. I don't think that is insurmountable. 
Plus, okay so the US dollar, Euro, and many currencies are relatively stable, but many aren't, and randomly they explode. So, okay, maybe bitcoin would only be better for 2 billion of the worlds population from a pure "stability" standpoint. 
Then you have to add a few 100 million people worldwide that just don't like using corrupt financial institutions. 
Then you have to add the people that might feel better paying for their fetish porn, or viagra semi-anonymously. So, 15 million or whatever.

I think it's far more practical to get a grid tie system then if your power company offers hourly pricing (changes based on electric demand), sign up for it. After like 9 pm to 6 AM it is always cheaper than standard rates, and on average or lower than average temp days it's even cheaper all day long. But since you would be grid tied, you'd be effectively wiping out most of those peak energy hours with your solar output and can just avoid the reoccurring expense of the battery.

Forgot lightning means fees for transfering in and out of it. 
Also lightning is a fiction at this point, and would require all the other players beyond the bitcoin core wallet to integrate it for the lightning core team. So, years before it could possibly be useful at scale. 
Also Forgot Small blocks might mean you can run a full node in uganda, but it'll be just a settlement system for larger players so no point for most users to run a full node. Seriously why run a full node if all my purchases are done on the lightning network, it's ridiculous. So, I'm supposed to and 10000 other little guys are supposed to run a full node for a network we've been actively priced out of. Kinda ridiculous to think that'll get more full nodes.

I know a family, the father made several million dollars, upon his death, his 3 children divided his fortune. One was a degenerate drunk, and was broke in like 5 years. One was a more responsible drunk, and purchased a house and other normal things, but eventually spent it all. The third invested her share into rental properties. 
So, his fortune, he had saved and scraped to build for a lifetime, was mostly gone in less than a decade after his death. 
So, let's say I have a 100 bitcoins, and I never sale them. Eventually I will die, then what happens? One of two things obviously, either they'll be forever locked away and unspendable to the end of time, or someone would inherit them. The odds that the inheritor will not sell them for things or fiat at least in portion is miniscule. So, the coins value one way or another will be redistributed. If the coins are locked away long enough eventually those coins would be viewed as forever lost to the economy. If they aren't then odds are some will be spent.

2025: that's like a century in cryptoland. But I'll predict with 100% accuracy!
Same strengths really, as in decentralized not government controlled, etc...
Weakness: Same really Government, corps, Ver, Jihan, Satan, will continue to try to steal the brand, or split the community, or force changes. 
Also, the limited transaction capacity is still an issue, and I still think that will ultimately cause problems unless the core devs can plan well in advance a method of increasing it. Otherwise, if bitcoin remains successful more and more use will float to corp held centralized wallets. I mean my upload bandwidth doubled this year finally from 5 Megs to 10, so in theory I could handle bigger blocks, by 2025 I'd guess it'd double again at least, so 20. 
Anyway, even I do think bitcoin will need large "blocks" even after the "Soft fork" options on the table are exhausted, I did not agree with the strong arm tactics of the segwit2x crowd though. 
Valuation by 2025, I've no friggen clue at all, anywhere from 10-100,000.00+ To many variables out of my control to make any real guess. Will, paypal integrate Bitcoin? Will the ETF happen, Will the gov crack down. Will   POS systems integrate. Will Lightning catch on in the real world. Does the community split again, if we hit another ultra high demand scenario and fees rise to a 100 bucks / transaction. 
Who knows. 
So, my prediction is penis.

Every transaction with an off chain provider proves whether that transaction held to the promise of giving you back the value it said it held for you. 
My bank calls the digits on the screen dollars, and I test that every time I go to the atm and demand a transaction to physical, same with offchain bitcoin "services". I'm almost 40 I've had a bank account since I was 18 22 years about and the 1:1 relationship of offchain dollars to physical dollars has been maintained. Bitcoin has numerous examples of offchain providers not passing that test. 
So, no they aren't "dollars" they are representations of dollars, which I can test by walking the 2 blocks to the bank. However, my 22 years of transacting with the bank has always resulted in physical dollars upon request. However, I still don't keep all my money in the bank I have a safe 20 feet from me with cash and silver in it. I also have a bitcoin wallet under my control.

anti-establishment and anti-capitalist. That doesn't make much sense. 
The current establishment isn't primarily capitalist. Some segments more than others. 
2008 crash showed us most of the big banks are not capitalist, the government showed us it wasn't capitalist. They showed us they are pro a controlled economy for the benefit of JP Morgan and the like and paid for politicians. 
Bitcoin is pure capitalism, there is no intervention at the protocol level at all. Sure, the government might try to steal your bitcoins, or a non-government thief might, but that's not bitcoin doing it. Bitcoin also won't retrieve your bitcoins if you lose them, it doesn't give a fuck at all, all it does is record transactions with zero judgement for the why or who the transaction involves.

Well, you can cut a pizza into 4 slices or 8 slices or 16 slices or 32 slices. You'll just need to eat more slices to be full, you'll consume the same surface area of pizza no matter how many slices, so the mere acting of making the smallest unit of measurement smaller doesn't alter the value of the pizza. 
So, more slices is not equal to inflation, at least in regards to the way the goobermint inflates the money supply. As in the goobermint does not simply issue 100,10, 5, and 1 dollar bils, and 50,25,10,5,1 cent coins, then "inflates" the supply by introducing a .1 cent coin, and also adjusting the total dollar value in circulation to account for the .1 cent coins. 
The goobermint simply issues more dollars in all denominations. 
If comparing it to pizza, the government would simply issue more pizzas by taking ingredients from the first pizza to make the second, then spending that second pizza as if it were equivalent to the original pizza. Whereas dividing the pizza in a bitcoin like manner, the original pizza as a whole remains unchanged, save the ability to select smaller slices if you wish.

1. It's most profitable to mine bitcoin in areas where the electricity supply is underutilized, and therefore the pricing should be appropriately lower to attract more power consumers. 
That alone offsets most of the bitcoin is killing the planet nonsense, as most of those regions are hydropowered. But even if not other areas that might be powered by nuclear or coal and underutilized, those kind of plants are base load plants and can't be dialed up or down in production so often power is literally wasted if not used, as you can't dump infinite power in the grid, the voltage would spike and blow up your shit!
2. How much environmental damage does a bank office cause. Asphalt for the parking spaces, employees burning gas to get to work, air conditioning, the computers they use to conduct business, etc...  What's the environmental impact of building the building.

Gov would have to provide useful services people want. 
Police, Fire Protection, and Roads, are a miniscule portion of the governments budget. The military, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, are the largest expenditures. 
So, most likely you'll see basic services remain, and ideological government programs like "policing the world", and vast wealth distribution by gunpoint reduce.

The only real database uses as I see it are.
1. Simply a way to check if any data has changed from when it was locked via a hash.
2. You could use it in a case where there is 1 write that will never change or very very rarely, then read from the blockchain. Like you could make a "permanent archive Coin", that stores important news articles and information forever, that would have to be a different "coin" than bitcoin though.  You could accomplish that to with non-blockchain storage using the first method though, but there really isn't any reason it couldn't be stored directly in the blockchain if designed for it.

I don't think the dynamic increase should be at a fixed rate. It seems it should look back at the average size of x blocks, probably skipping the most recent few to avoid any odd calculations because of potential orphans, and set the blocksize to be like 1.5 that size for the current block. So, the block size max could grow or shrink for each block.

Isn't the real problem bitmain, they control the supply of miners, set up their on massive mining pool, and probably a couple front mining pools on top. Seems to me the number 1 threat to bitcoin is bitmain. 51% attack would be no problem for them, plus they control if a softfork will happen. 
They could if they wanted to just stop selling miners to others, and take total control in no time. 
Really, the current method of POW is broken, IMO. It only works at all because 1 company is deciding not to act malicious. They already price the miners so only a fool would buy one, they are completely overpriced and I just typed the numbers in, even if I had .01 electricity I'd barely break even.

Well, you can make a lot off a few, or more off of many. Wal-Mart or Bloomingdales. 
There is an upper bound to the fees a "regular" joe will be willing to pay for a bitcoin transaction. So, despite what anyone says if fees get to high you simply will start losing potential users and transactions. So, while a bump to a large block would obviously reduce the total fees collected in the short term, it's highly probable in the mid or long term the total fees would be higher, which will be important as additional block reward decreases occur.
Edited to add... It's just not fees either, maybe joe blo ordinary guy might have held 1 Bitcoin. If he gets priced out by his standards by high fees, it's unlikely he'd continue to hold that bitcoin. Multiple that effect by 1000's and it would effect the supply demand equation and apply a negative pressure on price.

If bitcoin consistently hits 20 Megabyte blocks, bitcoin will be trading for multiples of a 1000.00. that would be like a 30 fold increase in usage. So, in that scenario if you own a fair amount of bitcoin now, you won't be to worried about buying a 10 TB hard.

Why not, if peter todd gets his way, bitcoin will just stagnate and fade into irrelevance. 
I seriously wouldn't trust him to plug in my computer monitor. He'd take a year.
Peter Todd objection to monitor plugging.
1. What if the increased power consumption, causes 1 an additional gallon worth of ice to melt, and that ice was necessary to help a polar bear to traverse the artic! No I'm afraid I can't help you until you prove that won't happen. 
2. If you plug in that monitor, you will likely view some porn, and then you won't be sexual frustrated enough to talk to the girl at McDonalds, that would have become your wife. Sorry my friend, the downside of plugging in this monitor are potentially to great.
3. Why should you get to have a monitor some developers I know don't have monitors, and that just wouldn't be fair!!

My personal opinion on the matter is we should have a "rolling" hash function. Blocks ending in 1 get hashed like now, Blocks ending in 2 get hashed with another algo, Blocks ending in 3 get hashed with another, etc.... 
The idea is your expensive acisc would be sitting idle 9/10's of the time, so probably wouldn't be worth it. So, if it's not worth making specialized hardware, it should devolve for many of the algos to gpu and cpu mining only for the majority of the blocks. Meaning everyone can mine again!!

Find your bitcoin.conf file, and modify dbcache=3000 if you have like 8GB's for the system, or if you have like 4GB then dbcache=1000  restart bitcoin.
I did the experiment about a year back. dbcache size was a HUGE factor in time it takes for initial sync. Once you are all up to date and synced, you can then change it to a more rational amount if you plan to use the computer for something else to. like dbcache=500. 
Really there should be an option dialogue upon install to ask how much ram you'd like to devote to bitcoin, as opposed to the default value which is only suitable for like a raspberry pi. 
As far as the question if we had 8MB would the problem get worse. Well, as stated above the "slowness" is largely because of low default settings for dbcache. When I did my initial sync on an AMD 8350 CPU the CPU never maxed out, the CPU seems to be waiting on data a lot of the time, so more ram devoted would help keep the underutilized CPU working. Anyway, point is the primary bottleneck most people are encountering is lack of ram, not the cpu, and ram density for computers is still increasing. I ended up devoting 3000 Megs to the dbcache and I believe it took like 8 hours or so. An AMD 8350 is a pretty old CPU now and it was nowhere near fully utilized.
So, would it take longer. I'm sure it would, would a properly configured bitcoin install take 8 times longer than yours is no way in hell. My computer in 10 days could have done the complete install from scratch like 30 times maybe more if I devoted 8 GBs.
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:22:20
1. Shouldn't those pools processing less change that to 1 Megabyte. Seems crappy to work the system like that. 
2. Obviously anyone with a few thousand bucks to burn, could back log the whole bitcoin network anytime they want. If the transaction onslaught earlier continued for 72 hours, I think we'd be in trouble.

You can set it lower than the maximum and your blocks will be accepted as valid by the rest of the network, but if you on your own set yourself to accept 20 MB blocks and hardly anyone else did, your nice new block would just be rejected, which means you'd have trashed 1000's of dollars.

It's for whatever the hell I would like to use it for and it's capable of allowing. 
Plus the only value in "saving" in any form is the ability to spend it at a later date. Gold for example is infinitely easier to transfer to the local currency, nearly every medium sized town has a Coin shop far more than all the nodes for bitcoin world wide, and several orders of magnitude greater than exchanges for bitcoin. So, why in the world would you save with Bitcoin longterm if the ability to use bitcoin in the real world is on the edge of non-existance. 
As in, I can Save FRN's and the reason that isn't a big deal is one knows you can easily exchange those FRN's for useful things in the future easily. True those FRN's may be worth less in the future, but it's near a 100% probable you will be able to exchange them for useful things in the future.
As in, I can Save in Gold, and the reason that isn't a big deal is one knows you can easily exchange that Gold at 1000's of locations across the country for FRN's and buy useful things in the future easily. It has the disadvantage of having to use one of 1000's of middle men to that, but a 1000 years of history is a pretty good indicator Gold will be convertible to useful things in the future. 
I can't exchange bitcoin for FRN's easily anywhere on the planet without giving my entire life history to an exchange, and or waiting days, and or meeting a stranger at the mall. 
Bitcoin is only good for long-term saving if the ability to use it for useful things in the future has a reasonable probability of being true. As is Bitcoin is weakest of all the methods of savings as there are so few methods of exchanging it for useful things when you want to cash in those "savings". 
Why is bitcoin in that situation? It's because we don't have but a small fraction of the userbase that FRN's or Gold/Silver have. Why do we have such a small fraction of the userbase? Because we don't have the transaction capacity to facilitate a large user base. Why do we have such a limited capacity thus preventing Bitcoin to serve as real method of relatively safe long-term savings? Because people want to run bitcoin on a raspberry pi, and a 56K modem. 
Bitcoin is 100% speculation at this point, its value has not been proven at all for "long-term savings". Global Remittances aren't "savings", which is one of a few advantages bitcoin has over FRN's or Gold, but that only holds if fees are rational, as not to price out a large swathe of the working class that regularly "remit" back to their home country.

The terminology for these supercomputers is messed up. Some list "cores" others GPUS. Cores in nvidia GPUS refers to Cuda Cores, my GTX 970 has 1664 "cores" per GPU card. A single k20x has  2688 cores per the data sheet from nvidia. 
So, either they didn't install a k20x in everyone of the 18,000+ machines, or their core count is low. As they can't be confusing cores with cards as you couldn't install 261,632 cards in a total of 18,000 machines, or I guess, they only used part of the total cards to run the test. Either way cores doesn't equal GPU.

No can't mine bitcoin directly, you can use nicehash.com and make some bitcoin though, it won't be near 1 bitcoin / month, I have a 7870 as one of my cards and currently as of 1 second ago it's making .55 a day before electricity cost.  In other words like 200.00/year at current rates. People that mine typically have 10's or even 100's of GPU's mining up to 6 cards per computer and that's all that computer does 24/7 365.

What we need is a couple of orders of magnitude greater adoption. So instead of saying I need to cash a little BTC to dollars I better go to an exchange, you can say to your friends, can someone trade me 50.00 dollars for some bitcoin, and 3 minutes later it's done. 
Right now I know exactly 0 people in the real world that use bitcoin. I'm the only person in this town I'm aware of, there is no critical mass to allow non-exchange dominated BTC culture to exists.  Exchanges are the primary choking point, a small oligarchy easily controlled in total which defeats the purpose of bitcoin. Well, a choking point, at present I suppose hostile miners are the greatest threat to bitcoin.  
I don't get the localbitcoin, and bitsquare stuff, you still have to transfer to a financial institution in most cases to make a trade, so back to square zero. The only real method for long term truly decentralized bitcoin from top to bottom is much greater adoption or else there will exist a choking point.

You should be watching the trucking industry, that employs like 10% of all workers in the US. Likely long haul truckers will be the first to go, and well right around then would be when to watch the carnage. Long haul trucking in "theory" should be easier, as you just have to worry about interstates, and initially you can have humans take over for the last leg. So, a highly monitored/mapped interstate is likely, as those trucks also will benefit from "density" as they'll report conditions to all nearby trucks like road debris, slickness, pot holes, erratic human drivers, etc.... Once the initial system gets perfected it's likely humans will be barred from operating heavy vehicles, as the safety difference will be large. 
From wikipedia on trucking.
Over 80 percent of all communities in the US rely exclusively on trucks to deliver all of their fuel, clothing, medicine, and other consumer goods. The trucking industry employs 10 million people (out of a total national population of 300 million)[43] in jobs that relate directly to trucking. The trucking industry is the industry of small business, considering 93 percent of interstate motor carriers (over 500,000) operate 20 or fewer trucks.[44]

I "hoard" because quite frankly I don't have enough really to buy with them. I have purchased stuff with bitcoin, but I have so much computer stuff it's retarded. Unfortunately, right now most of my spending is IRL, and then at amazon and ebay.
IF amazon and ebay ever take Bitcoin, it'd be on, I could then purchase everthing but food, gas, waterbill, electric bill, and taxes with bitcoin. 
Anyway, all my bitcoin "money" would just be sitting in a bank account if didn't have my "hoard".

How to run a full node for cost of electricity and 50 bucks once.
Go to your junk closet. Fish out that PC from 2009. Wow, dual core with 4 gigs of ram, and 120 gig harddrive. Use a computer to buy a 1 Terabyte harddrive from a reputable online merchant accepting bitcoin. 
Install 1 Terabyte harddrive. Install Bitcoin core on it. Go to your router port forward bitcoins port to your new old computer ip, and lock the local ip address to your computers mac address.Disable all that stupid power management stuff so your computer doesn't fall asleep like lazy computers do. 
Let it sync....    Come back.. oh you forgot to limit the max connections so set that to like 30 or suffin, so your internet is still usable. 
There you go. You iz done for like a few years, except to for 5 minutes every few months to upgrade the software.

How long has Bitcoin had 1 Megabyte blocks? 2 years, 3 years. In that time internet speeds globally have increased, hardware costs have decreased. 
I could see an argument for less than 20 MB's, but Peter Todd's position is no increase, even though increasing to 2 or probably 3 Megabytes would be as burdensome as 1 Megabyte was 2-3 years ago. 
He's not a reasonable person, IMO.

Taking a poop is more complicated. 
How to buy bitcoins. 1 possible method.
1. Go to coinbase, sign up.
2. Link bank account.
3. Buy Bitcoins. 
Done. Not really technical. 
Now, you can just leave your bitcoins on Coinbase if you want and spend from there, it's not the "best" plan, but nothing really wrong with it. Or you can proceed and do the following. 
Step 1. Acquire a Computer, you probably have this already. 
Step 2. Download a Bitcoin wallet, any will do that are a reputable build. 
Step 3. Copy your receive address in your bitcoin wallet, and use that as the send to address on coinbase and send your bitcoins to your wallet. 
Done, more or less, now if you want to be more secure. 
Step 1. Buy a trezor. 
Step 2. Follow simple instructions for setting up your trezor as provided by the manufacturer. 
Step3 Copy your receive address displayed on mytrezor.com into your bitcoin wallet and transfer your bitcoins. 
Done. Now you are highly Secure and in Control of your own Bitcorns!

Bitcoin is in the highly subsidized phase, where growth should be be a very high priority. "fee" markets aren't important at this point, bitcoin becoming more than nerd money should be. It appears some think bitcoin has arrived or something. It's worth in total 6.5 Billion world wide, we have less than a million "real" users. It's pathetically small and inconsequential at that this point. 
Miners are paid primarily via the block reward, and will be for years. We should be using this period to you know like grow.
So, like 1 in 1000 use bitcoin at all if that congrats. That's not impressive to me, nor inspirational, nor world changing, nor interesting. It might as well not exist if it stops growing, or grows at a minuscule rate. 
So, you know the devs if they had any sense of human psychology at all, would cede 2MB, and 4 in two. Why because even with lightning we'll need larger blocks, and if bitcoin can't "survive" 2 MB blocks then it isn't going to be the crypto of choice in a few years anyway. 2MB blocks shortly would inject a positive growth feeling again. Psychology is important. We're GROWING!!!! as opposed to we might hit a wall:(.. 
Bitcoin is losing it's "feeling", that's the real danger. Like it or not a large fraction of the user base does not hold your opinion, and many don't hold mine. However, under any successful scenario we'll need 2 MB blocks. Alleviating what might be viewed as "irrational" fear is still alleviating fear, uncertainty and doubt.

21 BTC wouldn't be enough at 10K, but that would buy a nice house around here free and clear. 
I'd never buy a supercar or travel a ton even if a billionaire, so don't need to account for that in my equation. 
My personal goal is a 100 Bitcoins, doesn't look like I'll make it though because of the price runup, at 60K per coin, well, I'd be set for life. My "ideal" lifestyle is pretty modest though. It'd be a small hobby farm, solar, I'd buy an all electric car, probably a model 3 tesla, and drive that until the wheels fell off in 10 years. Don't drink or do drugs. So, yeah, I'd be optional work only at 60K. Really I could likely retire comfortably at 30K / coin really.

AWS is very expensive compared to simply buying your own GPU(s). AWS is big as a singular entity but miniscule in comparison to the overall GPU market. 
I'll happily rent you my little mining farm at AWS rates!
I have like 35 GPU's mining even now, and I'm in a small midwestern town of no consequence.  
Here is AWS's behemoth GPU rig, impressive!!! But it is not going to cover its cost in mining revenue not even in the ballpark.
type            GPU's vcpus ram     network     $/hour(demand) $/hour (reserved 3 years)
p2.16xlarge 16       64     732     20 Gbps     $14.400     $6.800
So, they'd be renting at the 14.4 rate / hour, and that's just 16 large GPU's. Go look at the number of miners just using nicehash.com  You'll quickly see that they would need 100's or 1000's of those rigs far more than amazon has to rent by the way. 
Amazon I suppose might select to run their own hardware when it's not rented I suppose, I'm sure they have cheap power. I'm unsure of their actual costs for infrastructure, but it is likely pretty high considering they are building these rigs to high reliability standards with redundant infrastructure. I doubt they'd purchase any rigs to mine exclusively, that'd likely be done totally seperate if they did, using different standards. As an individual mining rig going down for 15 minutes is not comparable to a website crashing 15 minutes.
Now, they could go on a stupid overpriced rental campaign at nicehash and the other rental sites, Maybe that would be enough hahsrate, but it'd cost a lot. As you'd need all of it, plus some likely as a lot of the hashrate isn't available for rent. But again, if word got out someone was renting hash to attack the network, a sizable portion would simply stop renting their miners for the duration. So... it'd have to be a silent orchestrated attack, not seeing it really. How can you keep an attack like that dark for days?

Bitcoin doesn't realize it's home is on the moon. Unfortunately we raised it on earth, and it doesn't know any better. We are attempting to communicate with the Bitcoin, but thus far efforts have only resulted in a few attempts at flight.
@_date: 2017-02-12 11:03:29
Not true. The problem with that theory is that it assumes you'd build the same type of machine for a datacenter that you would for a home user. A datacenter can have stripped down machines, as in like no cover, no individual fans, no push buttons, led display etc... Also the datacenter will receive the asics in bulk via container for a few bucks / unit, whereas the home miner will be paying far higher costs. 
So, even if the chips are the same, even if the core components are basically the same an industrial operation at scale could easily acquire the same hash for at least 20% less FOREVER. 
The advantage GPU mining has and not saying it is perfect, is that at least many people simply would like to recoup some of their costs they paid for their AMD 480 card, So, The home user doesn't need to always think in terms of "profit" but rather mining revenue would merely offset a portion of the cost. But again, you'd have miners gathering around the hydroplants, and making more off the same work, and people in ultrahigh electricity locations will rarely mine, because it'd cost more than the electricity. 
But it's possible to make an asic for any "Static" Proof of Work hashing method. If we had some kind of "morphing" hash function that always changed slightly yet would always be valid, I guess that could prevent asics and possibly even GPU's, but that's a job likely for AI to figure out. 
I'm not sure anymore. Maybe Proof of Work is just not a good idea afterall.

Only if you don't drink the Kool-Aid. 
I've purchased two "Virtual" Mining contracts. Both ended up eventually running off with peoples money, but I did profit, because I got out as soon as things started looked goofy, and the cult like posters started appearing, and censorship began occuring. 
I purchased at zenminers shortly after it started, and it was GREAT!, I made a buttload compared to my investment, but that is only because once they started changing the rules, and promising more and more I saw that as a sign to exit. Apparently a lot of others were blinded by greed. I turned like 6.5 bitcoins into like 27 Bitcoins after completely sold off.

You actually have it ass backwards. 
ASICS make bitcoin easy to attack by a state actor. Why you may ask..... Well I'll tell you. 
The installed base of ASICS compared to GPU's or CPU's is miniscule, laughably so. It's likely only 10's of thousands of people world wide own an asic miner for bitcoin. I don't know anyone in real life that owns a bitcoin asic miner. But I can walk a 100 foot in any direction and run into a household that owns a graphics card. 
So, parties that are participating in Bitcoin Asic mining is 10's of thousands. Cost to enter Bitcoin mining via an ASIC 1000 dollars+ versus cost for 100's of millions of households to enter GPU mining is 0, as many already have a graphics card capable of mining, even if it's not an ideal model, simply to play games. 
Also, the politics of nationalizing ASIC mining production for security purposes would be a minor political discussion for most of the world, as in since all those ASIC chips are made in Asia particularly china, as opposed to trying to take control over the production and sale of GPU's which would be an international incident of biblical proportions, as huge sections of the economy rely directly or indirectly on GPUS as in "real" mining, oil drilling, architectural design, movie production, games obviously, the new self driving cars, plus many more. There will be no seizing of GPU production ever.  
As far as Google or Amazon taking over with GPU mining or ASIC mining, Well, Google or Amazon are big enough to run production for their own ASIC miners at any time, and seeing the installed base of ASIC miners is small, they'd have to produce far less and spend less than they would have to in the case of acquiring millions  of GPU's to mine with.  Amazon and Google do not have a million GPU's doing computing tasks, they just don't, the market for such simply does not exist at present to justify building that many gpu rigs. 
So, to summarize, it would be cheaper for a Google, or amazon, or government, or Exxon or Apple for that matter, to build an ASIC chip which is a retardedly simple chip compared to a GPU or CPU, than to attempt to buy a million GPUs and stuff them in server rigs.
ASICS are the worst way to secure bitcoin in reality... People like to compare the computing power of an ASIC against a CPU for highly optimizable algos like bitcoin uses, and spout FAKE lies that the ASICs are more secure because they can outhash a CPU by orders of magnitude, they fail to point out that the requirements to build an ASIC are trivial in comparison, and far far far cheaper, and since it's a single function useless device for anything but mining, the installed base of potential miners will be small forever. 
What we need is a hashing algo that is Immune from being replicated in an ASIC for a price that would give it an economic advantage over a GPU or CPU. 
Edited to add, that's why people talk about algos that are memory intensive, as if the algo was highly reliant on memory, all those ASICS one might produce would need tons of memory to perform it's task, memory is expensive, and therefore an algo that required 4 GB of memory and was constrained by communication with that memory would render an ASIC chip that did hashes on the memory held values a tiny advantage. However, computers and video cards would have that memory already available so, would not be an obstacle to them.

Obviously the candidates presented by the Powers that be are stooges. The selected stooge will get blamed for the coming economic disaster and the rise of bitcoin as a result of a last ditch effort to restore global trade in 2019, 2019 we'll have segwitness done, lightning, and 4 meg blocks, enough to support essential economic trade between nation states via a trusted medium, initially not all day to day transaction, but transactions between retailers and manufactures, mining, oil, governments, etc. 
The Economic war that exploded in 2017 and destroyed trust between nations will result in a standard one world currency known as bitcoin and the basic unit will be Dubbed a Satoshi  and that will be required to be accepted for all debts public and private. Nations initially will peg to the bitcoin their own variants but by 2025 with the international Bitcoin Fiber/Sat links in place, 100 Meg blocks become standard. Also UN Resolution 2562.b section IIa specifies that any nation state, organization or individual that attempts to block, manipulate, or reroute bitcoin data  and or intentionally interfere with mining operations will be considered in violation of the Global Peace and Trade Initiative of 2018, and be considered an act of war.

I did this a couple of days ago though without a script and just using the default dbcache size. Here is the results from another thread. It appears dbcache is the primary factor as you synced like over 3 times faster. Your cpu is better to, but not 3 times better. I may redo this again with a larger dbcache to see the result.
 Test 1 15 hours 16 minutes with default dbcache size. OUCH!! that's a long time.
Test 2 6 hours 28 minutes with dbcache=2000. That's a lot better!!! Seems bitcoin core should present an option upon initial install for the user to select an amount of ram to use and explain the dramatic speed increase.

Amazon doesn't have infinite instances available, especially the larger ones. They really would not be able to do that at a whim. Amazon likely would have to build new instances to facilitate an order large enough to compete against the whole rest of the mining community, and that would only be done, if they had a long term contract which is 3 years of which a large fraction is payable upfront. 
You would be talking HUGE cash, enough so, that'd it'd likely make more sense to build your own farm outside of AWS, as with AWS you are paying for reliability and massive network pipes as well, mining really doesn't require 20 GBps network connections, or 99.99% uptime guarantees on every individual mining rig, etc...

It's not hard to figure out what you owe. 
You record what you purchased the bitcoin for like 400.00, and then when you sale it, you subtract the 2. So, sold for 1000.00-400.00 equals 600 capital gains. Then multiply that by long term or short term capital gains rate. So could be 600*.15=90.00 if longterm (over a year), and you fit in the tax bracket.

I think it'd be useful to have a barebones pci-express slot powered miner. Sure it would likely only be like a 100 Gh/s or something, but it wouldn't require a case, nor special power supply, etc..... just like a 20.00 card composed of basically just mining chips. 
The industrial miner will always have the advantage, just from shipping, not to mention stripped down miners with no case, large high efficiency power supply, optimal cooling strategy etc...   The individual will never be able to compete really against the megaminer, unless.... something like a pci-express mining card happens, that isn't loud, and huge, and isn't expensive at all.

Because China is behind the Great Firewall and China also controls the majority of the hashing power, therefore China in effect controls the blockchain, and since that blockchain originates behind the great Firewall that imposes an artificial limit to the rate of transmission to and from china, thus we are limited to a useless bandwidth rate which limits the maximum blocksize to a near useless size. China will always dominate any method of securing a blockchain that is overwhelmingly dependent on electricity as they have cheap government or environmentally subsidized electricity far cheaper than most countries. 
The only solution I can see is a change from Proof of Work, as of Right now, China dictates the data flow via there artificial government subsidized electricity cost advantage which lends them an advantage in mining.

My present thinking on lightning is it's not likely to replace "normal" payments, but rather be used primarily for microtransactions. 
So, the "Capital" requirements likely won't be a 1000 EUR or USD / user, more like 20.00-100. I can see games using lightning to facilitate the ingame economy, I can see it facilitating sub penny to like .05 transactions to view a webpage, etc.... those kind of applications. Larger purchases like buiying a 300.00 video card I highly doubt will be done over lighting. Why? Well, because people won't like leaving 1000's in lightning "just in case" they might buy something.
IMO, it'll be more equivalent to how much cash does one carry in their wallet, as opposed to how much do you have in your bank account.   
edited to add... So essentially I don't see lightning as a panacea that will solve all problems, but rather make some new applications that aren't practical at the moment possible or move even 1.00-20.00 dollar transactions off chain. I still wholly believe we'll need regular blocksize increases.
edited again.... So, to address your centralization question. I think the capital requirements will be lower, so it wouldn't be as extreme a barrier to entry as one might assume if viewing lightning as a 1:1 replacement for "traditional" on chain transactions. An oligarchy of 100's-1000's undoubtedly though.

Well, bandwidth doesn't scale like that. You'd be assuming a greater percentage gain in bandwidth year over year than at present, which is very unlikely. You multiply the next years value by the previous years value as the new base block size, so you are multiplying  the growth factor by a larger base block size after each year. So, the rate of growth in terms of "MB"does increase more over time.
At 1.15 yearly growth multiplier the new block size after each year would be the following with 1 MB as the start
At 1.15 yearly growth multiplier the new block size after each year would be the following with 4 MB as the start
At 1.3 yearly growth multiplier the new block size after each year would be the following with 4 MB as the start
I'd be comfortable with the first two growth rates, the third would be a disaster.

I'd say it'd push reliance for the propagation of blocks to those with connections that have an upload speed greater than 10mb / sec at minimum.  
So, anyone in my area would not be able to meaningfully pass new block data to other connected nodes. 
So, it'd reduce it. 
In theory land any block size increase would to some degree "reduce" security. However, there is a balance that has to be made, as we shouldn't design bitcoin to work on 56K modem just to ensure the absolute maximum possible node count either. If we did design bitcoin for 56K modems then while it would increase possible nodes, it'd likely actually reduce the total node count as the blocksize required for that would only support a small fraction of the current bitcoin transaction rate and therefore user base. It's unlikely someone not using bitcoin would run a node. 
So, how do you "judge" a "Good" block size value, as in one that provides enough room for transactions/user base but also hits a sweet spot for the vast majority to be able to meaningfully participate in the network by running a node. 
I don't have an absolute answer, but I live in a relatively "rural" town I'm not at the edge of technology availability. So, I kind of judge my situation as a "good" estimate for the "standard" available connection, which is 5 mb upload/sec.  So, then I type in upload calculator in google. 
Then I type in 8mb to get a general "feel" for the impact that would have every 10 minutes and also keeping in mind, I should be able to upload the blocksize (8mb) at least like 8 times if necessary plus have room for additional bitcoin network traffic, and excess upload speed available to do other online activities. 
As a Non-mining node. I'm not accounting for latency and its effect on mining new blocks. The miners have pretty much made their own network for that anyway.

I do agree to some degree, the reluctance to support a long term method of increasing the blocksize at regular intervals is the source of the divide to begin with. 
Segwit. okay. then what... oh lightning. great for microtransactions  and small transactions nothing else, great.. signature enhancements, great... still gonna need block size increases, every company, living organism, etc... knows you have to create more of your basic operation methods of operation to grow. A company adds more locations, an animal has children... etc.....
Efficiency has its limits. Eventually an IT department has to add another server, bitcoin will need larger blocks, just f'n schedule a hardfork to allow for such at a later date. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:30:42
Depends which side remains unreasonable. 
PErsonally if the chain is destined to split, I view it as an I'm out of this clusterfuck situation, where supposed technical devs post easy to manipulate polls to stir the shit. 
We could just increase block size at a rational rate of like .15 a year... I mean if hardforks are on the table now, then why not do one that will bring most of the community together. We'd get segwit, and a rational yearly blocksize increase, and then we could have lightning as well. Every rational person should be able to tolerate that.

Ummmm, it's easy to end this. Implement a annual "Base" blocksize increase every year like .15, and introduce that code in a bitcoin core release to activate at a minimum of a year after that release and require that it only be "Activated if Segwit activates. 
So, segwit gets activated, and miners are assured they will get more "onchain" transactions as well.

It will be years before bitcoin is stable, don't plan for that. There is a limited supply if bitcoin is working according to plan, there should be new users attempting to acquire from the essentially same sized pool of coins, so if it's "working" price should rise on average until we get a very large user base. Really it shouldn't be "stable" for decades.

mcburger opens a store, mcburger burgers are served fast and cheap, lots of people like mcburger, mcburger gets more popular, there are waiting lines for mcburger, mcburger raises prices in order to control demand for the precious mcburgers. 
kingburger opens next door, and sends spies over to mcburger, and copies most of their process, and adds a few enhancements. kingburger, opens more locations as soon as burger serving time gets to high. kingburger vows to keep burger prices affordable for the working man!
mcburger is not interested in opening more burger locations until they perfect the burger making process and there is no rush as they invented the BURGER!! they got time. 
kingburger now has 8 locations. mcburger is working on rearranging the chairs in it's restaurant to increase capacity by 30%. kingburger copies mcburgers chair layout scheme and opens another 8 stores. 
kingburger now is large enough to benefit from economies of scale regionally. 
mcburger, eventually a few years later decides to open a second branch by then kingburger owned 80%+ of the market and growing. 
mcburger didn't die nor was abandoned, just a tiny niche restaurant.

Obviously you'd join a pool to mine like everyone does even today that GPU mines on the small scale. A pool doesn't control you though, if they get stupid, you just change a line in your launch file, and you are mining at a different pool of which there are 100's to select from. 
You don't have to mine 24/7 to mine, you can mine whenever you want you just won't make any money when you aren't mining. I stop my GPU's from mining if the power price spikes (I'm on real time hourly pricing) or if I want to play a game. 
YEah, he'll have to pay for the power cost... Well, anyone that is served by ameren illinois for example can mine with GPU's even now at a profit (not bitcoin obviously). I do it. It's unlikely I'm the only location outside of china that can figure this out.

It wouldn't matter. 
Example. My nephew will buy the GTX 1080 whether bitcoin existed or not. So, the installed base of potential miners will be unchanged by GPU farms in china. Also, he'll look and say Oh, I can make .25 if I let this mine bitcoin when I'm at work, cool, might as well, it's just sitting there doing nothing when I'm gone anyway... 
So, his upfront cost to mine bitcoin with a GPU is exactly 0.00 dollars. He would never ever in a million years plop down 1500 bucks to buy an asic. But he'll always buy a new video card every few years... That's the difference, the mining farm will have an advantage in "profit"... they just will never be able to overwhelm the installed potential GPU base.

It seems to me this would be startling easy for netflix to do with the slightest of cooperation from the "major" wallet providers. 
As in Netflix likes it autopay monthly feature. Well, they could approach coinbase, and ask them for the ability for the user to set up monthly payments from their hosted wallet. They of course would still allow monthly manual payments, but that is kind of a pain for services you know you are going to keep years. 
Coinbase could make the "contract" only require "reapproval" upon Netflix changing the amount requested and or if requested a payment in less than the minimum time duration between payments. So, Netflix would still request payment every month with the details. You wouldn't blindly send a payment forever (in case of closure), and if the payment matches your approved contract profile it'd pay it. So, you'd have a "Filter" of sorts for the range of payment allowed to be paid to them as well.

Wow, you are so overwhelmingly wrong. 
The fact that asics are expensive to acquire, and useless for anything other than bitcoin mining, means the number of individuals buying and using them will be small forever by design. You can't even achieve a thoroughly decentralized model with ASICS. IT's a fairy tale. 
What may I ask will google do with these datacenters filled with GPU's after? The demand for a million GPU's for on demand rental purposes outside of cryptocurrencies doesn't exist. 
You could actually make a single button bitcoin miner, it's almost that easy already. You download a miner, change a line in the bat file and click it. That's it. It really takes me about 2 minutes tops to start mining after download.
Also I never said a 100 million would mine, I was saying the installed base of potential miners was massive. Plus, if bitcoin isn't interested in growing to add more users what is the point of this whole affair. So, obviously bitcoin will have to grow beyond the zygote stage at some point.  Again, as I stated previously small miners use pools which are well connected to the internet. Pools that don't own their own hardware aren't a threat to bitcoin, as participation is wholly optional. 
I seriously get the feeling you are just arguing to argue by stating talking points. 
AGain, if my cost for hardware to mine bitcoin is 0.00 as I already would have purchased the video card for other uses, that offsets the advantage a pure mining farm concern has to a large degree. As in I could even mine bitcoin with an ASIC today at profit if the ASIC cost me 0.00 dollars upfront and all I had to pay for was electricity. So, a mining farm will have to buy that 400.00 dollar video card and make back that 400.00 dollars plus some to call it a profitable venture. The regular guy that would have purchased that 400.00 video card to play games anyway, does not suffer from that expense in his calculations as he's just mining for shits and giggles mostly and/or to support the network and/or for some of that internet money.
So, repeat this, if a device is only good for one specialized purpose the demand for that device will be be less than a device that can serve that same purpose but many other purposes as well, that will mean the preinstalled user base potential will be greater for the second device always. 
Also a multifunction device (GPU) that is produced in orders of magnitude greater numbers will likely be produced in more locations than a niche product of singular purpose, which lends to more resistance against attempts at monopolization of production. 
Naw, dude, ASICS are horrible. IF bitcoin launched with the prerequisite to mine being the purchase of a 1500.00 dollar miner I doubt a 1/100th of those curious would have mined at all, and subsequently been sucked down the rabbit hole into cryptoland.

Otherwise, you are just spoofing node counts and not actually helping the network.

Nicehash isn't mining bitcoin directly, you essentially mine altcoins for others and they pay you in btc. You can't practically mine bitcoin anymore with a CPU or graphics cards.  Mostly the alt coin mining is done with GPU's so how long it'll take you will largely depend on that variable. Though on some newer POW algos they do require a lot of computer ram in addition to a GPU to mine, in an attempt to counter ASIC miners.

This is the 3rd most powerful supercomputer in the world. I used the 3rd on the list as the top 2 didn't use GPU's. 
Notice it only has 18,688 GPU's. Yeah, that's a lot, but miniscule really compared to the installed base of GPU's some individual miners even today have 100's of Gpus mining. And that supercomputer costs almost a 100 Million dollars. So, really, I don't think the threat is any greater really than a State simply being a massive asic farm. If anything it'd be easier to subvert Asics seeing they are all made in a few factories and nearly all of them are densely packed in easily seizable warehouse mining farms.

So, they needed to create something outside of government, that can stand even after the nation states of the world are in ruins!

Why not just set the blocksize like Minimum blockSizeAllowed=20MB
but then set it to 20% greater than the average of the last 100 blocks starting 10 blocks back from the current block or thereabout if the average was greater than 20MB. 
The 10 block back offset is just to ensure the calcuations were done on well confirmed blocks. 
So, the blocksize would slowly creep higher. 
To account for day activity being higher than night activity, you could set it to lower the max block size at a slower rate if falls below the last blocks allowed size, like 1% degradation. 
It seems there should be an automated way to do this without hard coding a fixed number.
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:33:15
I'm pretty sure the node counts falling is a result of the ever increasing difficulty of solo mining and rise of mega pools. People simply didn't need the Bitcoin software running 24 x 7 anymore. As in the intention of a percentage of those that dropped off was not to run a full node, but to simply mine bitcoin at home solo. Now that is not practical for 99.9% of the population of course some full nodes would go away forever. 
Also the rise of altcoin mining. People aren't likely to run more than a couple Wallets at a time.  So, when Video Cards stopped being useful for bitcoin mining, most of those people switched to altcoin mining with their same hardware, which likely meant closing the bitcoin software on the local machine, and committing full local resources to litecoin or whatnot, and after that most just shut them down entirely. The percentage of those miners that transitioned to asic miners, unless they had a huge asic farm went the pool route. 
Also, with the rise of all the online wallets, leads to the inexcusable behavior of storing bitcoins on them, back in the day I'm sure the percentage of people using the bitcoin core wallet as their day to day wallet was higher, so people were more likely just to leave it running, and thus adding a node. 
Bandwidth is not really a problem in the US or Europe (most nodes are there) for 1 MB blocks, sure some isolated areas but the vast majority of people have upload capacity far in excess of the requirements of bitcoin, and current blockchain storage requirements are inconsequential for any modern computer. 
I don't see it, just to pathetic to believe all these bitcoiners in the US and Europe are so broke they are worried about 100 GB's of storage, and a megabit or 2 of upload to explain the drop off up to this point. I think that could be the reason for the poorest regions, but that most certainly isn't the primary reason in developed countries. 
I mean there are 10 million people in New York City area all have high speed internet available faster than mine, and a couple hundred are contributing there. It's not bandwidth or a 100 dollar 2 terrabyte hard drive preventing full node count.

Bitcoin might help a few, but during SHTF, nothing can be counted on. The good quality about bitcoin though, is at least it will be there, when the power gets restored/internet, or you leave the area to a sane locatioin.
This logic isn't just prevalent in bitcoin silver/gold nuts also think it will work well in SHTF. It won't on any macroscale, because it can not fix the problem, that products aren't being produced and moved, and pricing is nearly impossible to ascertain because of the uncertain supply.
If you are worried about SHTF scenarios, stock up on non-persihable food water, if you can have at least a small solar system. If legal own some firearms and adequate ammo to protect your possessions.
Edited to add... But of course holding large amounts of government fiat money isn't a good option either in these SHTF scenarios, some cash would be good, but if things get bad, they nearly always devalue it, and the cost of items skyrockets.

Yep, your just guessing a number in a specified range, then converting it into another format. So, yeah, you could guess the correct number, but the number of numbers is very large. While I actually Intellectually understood the improbability of guessing a private key at random, I did download some brute force bitcoin programs before. Even though I was checking Billions of numbers per second against a list of like 50,000 high value addresses, the uselessness of the task, trully became apparent, as I only went through a paltry number of possible keys in a day. I'd need like 10000 more computing power to give me a good chance in my lifetime, but that would mean paying 1000's a month in a power bill, and dropping enough money to buy 10000 GTX 1080's....
Not worth it, just to play the lottery that I might find a big wallet. 
My conclusion is you could simply use the computing power to mine bitcoin or alts and you'd be far better off. 
I mean we aren't talking wimning the power ball odds, we're talking winning the powerball every week for a month type odds. True you can "buy more lottery" tickets by adding more computing power, but that computing power does cost money to, and while your trying to hack satoshis coins, with 1 in a trillion odds in your lifetime, you could just mine.

I could participate at 32 MB blocks, but only on the download side, as in I could keep my "home" node synced easily. However, my upload would only be able to upload to a couple of other nodes in 10 minutes, maybe 3. So, not ideal really.
I think 32MB is to large.
As far as my cost. Well, it's pretty well buying a bigger hard drive than necessary otherwise. I had the best internet plan available before I got into bitcoin, and if bitcoin were to disappear tomorrow I still would. I also currently mine (not bitcoin obviously), with that computer, so it's on 24/7 anyway, so, costs likely a couple watts additional per hour. 
My "node" has a AMD 8350 with 16 GBS of ram. It's pretty well idle 99% of the time effectively CPU wise (5%), and I still have free ram on the system. So, hardware wise I'm good.
So, my present full node cost essentially we'll say a 100 bucks. If had 32 MB blocks, well, likely would require buying another hard drive sooner, so another 100 bucks in a year or so. 
I'd be comfortable with 8 MB blocks. I could still contribute a "meaningful" amount on the upload side with that.

That's why think it's rational to just put a yearly multiplier on the blocksize for like 10 years. 1.15ish times current size every year, should calm everyone down for a few years anyway.  By then we'll have real world data, and can if needed adjust plans.

Personally I think people overblow the initial sync time problem. Sure it takes a long time, but you ever have to do it once. After that it's not bad at all. 
Fact is most people aren't going to run a node even if it only took 4 hours to sync completely, simply because they don't want to do anything other than use bitcoin. They use coinbase, or some light wallet, or hardware wallet exclusively. 
I do run my own node because I actually want to participate in the network, but fact is a large percentage will never want to, they want to simply be users. 
I'd say 10% really of total bitcoin users will ever run a node no matter how easy it is, because it's to simple to use bitcoin without doing it. You can say they aren't really using bitcoin then, and I kinda agree, but that's just how people are.

Not really,everyone has ossified into core is God camp or BU is God Camp. Truth is both camps lick donkey balls. 
Truth is core offers nothing going forward, and BU offers insanity. And yeah, since segwit, and lightning are permanently locked out of activiation, they offer no path forward with the new reality. 
Oh, but people will say, We'll hardfork!!! to get what we want..... yeah, and make everything core said for years a blatant lie in regards to fears of hardforks. If hardforks are on the table, then we could have a hardfork that brings the community closer together instead of rips it apart. So... there's that.
Oh, but we'll let the users activate segwit!!!! Yeah, and change the fundamental way the network is modified, in contradiction to the history of bitcoin.
Oh..... but... but....
Truth is core simply will not bend at all, trees bend so they don't snap. BU is a violent response to rigidity, and just as crazy. 
Solution, moderate scheduled longterm "base"  blocksize increase that will last for a decade or longer. My compromise solution is 1.15 multiplier applied per year blocksize increase. If that or similar is not viewed as palatable then bitcoin is dead, you can call whatever exists a year or two from now "bitcoin", after the nuke options have been launched, but it won't be, all for the cost of ego. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:51:17
WHy wouldn't we just do 1.15 multiplier increase to the blocksize / year. IF you do 2mb, you'll need another hardfork in the future when even more people are involved, making it even more difficult.
Edited to clarify 1.15 is a multiplier to base blocksize.

I think the logic is that they simply do not trust that core will ever allow an increase after. Simple solution is to release a version that will cause a hardfork like a year in the future, that includes a simple multiplier to the active blocksize at regular intervals. like simply newBlocksize= 1.15 x present blocksize at interval x. 
But that code would have to be added now, not a promise to add it possibly in the future. Without something like that I think no resolving the conflict with a horrible cryptowar, which will result in a hardfork anyway!

The past is the future....
It all began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven, to the Dwarf Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern over each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret, a master ring, to control all others. And into this ring he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the free peoples of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, the ring ensnared a new bearer. The ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels under the Misty Mountains, and there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind; and in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived. Its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire. For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all...

Fact is nutters will be nutters, No mention of the Democrat Terrorist Arm called Antifa either I suppose. Yeah, I'm going to force the Dems to take credit for their nuts if people want to do that when a Trump Fan goes nuts. 
For Some reason though Antifa which has actually caused real physical harm to people is cool to post on all the lefty social media sites with a few taps on the wrist now and then to pretend to enforce standards. If Gab should be shunned into non-existance, then so should all the social media sites because they all have had MURDERERS use their sites to post and enflame and learn that share their love for extreme left ideas. 
However, no standards apparently apply if you are on the left and large. 
As far my original comment do I actually think Twitter is "communist" no but they're obviously sympathetic to all leftist ideologies and that reflects in their moderation policies. Gab is more right leaning than twitter for sure, but that just means in this day and age they believe in freedom of speech even unappealing speech, which was the standard in this country for decades.

Not possible. 
I however, am a genius, and converted by dragonmint miner into a hot water heater!!!! 
Not really a genius, all I did was put a cardboard box all around my hotwater heater, not air tight but sealed enough to keep the whole water heater bathed in the exhaust air from the miner, which exhausts into the box enclosure via a square hole it fits snuggly into. It is a gas(not on) powered water heater so it has a hole  right down the middle of it all the way to the bottom for an exhaust pipe, so I put a computer fan rigged to a 12 volt transformer for power on the top of that hole to force the hot air down the middle as to increase the heating rate. 
Total Cost=0.00 as would be running the miner anyway. 
Anyway, it does a pretty good job actually, probably not heating potential for a family, but enough for me, it's like "barely" hot. Just about right for showers. It does take quite a few hours to recharge after showering, that's fine for me, but again I don't think it'd be good enough for a family, maybe 2 people on different schedules. 
So, there you go I increased my efficiency for 0 cost!!!

I think it's multiple reason. 1. less usage in general. 2. Different usage behavior. Personal Example. Before the fee fiasco, Nicehash used to send me multiple transactions a week(going back farther and it was daily). Now they have the option to send direct to coinbase for no fee, I'm assuming they just have an account at coinbase and so instead of them sending 1000's of transactions to individual wallets a good portion of those now use the centralized solution. This isn't a big deal for me, considering it's small amounts and once the amount of btc get's large enough can move it to my own wallet. So, that one thing just for me has likely saved a 100 on chain transactions from me alone this year. And I'm one singular fish in the bitcoin ocean. 
Then you have the liquid network now to for exchanges to swap btc, I've no idea how it works I've not looked into it, but that'll save transaction space if utilized. No idea what percentage of the bitcoin transactions that potentially is. 
I don't think Lightning has had any effect on onchain transactions thus far simply because it isn't really rolled out and in development, but that could in theory keep a good portion of transactions off the main chain in the future. 
I'd say the majority of the reduction is from an actual decline in usage as everyone isn't rushing to move their bitcoins around when the price was 18K. Hell, I even moved some to an exchange and sold a bit, and it COST me to do it, but no choice.

No there isn't. Bitcoin by definition requires transacting on its blockchain. Even if you are speaking of "solutions" that aren't active like lightning, they still settle back to the blockchain eventually, but that's not implemented so doesn't exist, so isn't a solution for "Walmart" at this time.

Almost no one uses Bitcoin and the blocks are full, that's not a contradiction that's the reality. A couple hundred thousand people world wide with enough bitcoin to buy dinner or more is the total user base. .001 bitcoins is not a bitcoin user, disingenuous people count those people.

It's true the amount of electricity/transaction is retarded. Good news is if we increased transaction capacity the electricity required wouldn't be required to go up just for the sake of additional transactions.In theory if Segwit activated and we increased blocksize further to a 100 MB even (not saying we should have 100 MB blocks) the electric requirement would not need to change. 
That's not saying more miners wouldn't be added, just saying transaction capacity doesn't require it.

Or Tell small blockers that even with lightning and segwit only, bitcoin will still be only able to serve a small user base. Yes a kick to the can, but not the panacea. 
Or Tell big blockers even with 10 MB blocks bitcoin will only be able to serve a small user base, and 100 MB blocks is a no go for the VAST VAST majority of bitcoin users and miners. Yes 10 MB blocks would kick the can, but it doesn't get us to the panacea.  
Problem is people are fanatics! Bitcoin is a joke if we can't increase transaction capacity by several orders of magnitude, and no, people WILL not be leaving lightning channels open for 6 months with significant amounts of bitcoin either, so don't cite those ridiculous hopium stats. 
Only real solution is do segwit/lightning and then increment the base block size over time as well with a f*cking Hard Fork. Get over it, it's that or nothing changes EVER, as in bitcoin remains a clusterf*ck like today. 
And before the delusional amongst us jump in to retort. Oh but the ultra wealthy will use bitcoin, fees are of no concern. No, the ultra wealthy have no need for bitcoin, they have no trouble moving cash. If you are a millionaire or even worth 10 million you aren't the ultra wealthy. Oh but Central Banks will hold it to stabilize their Currencies. No they won't that would be like shooting yourself in the face to prevent someone else doing it. Their whole function is to protect their national currency they have total control over, they will not buy a currency they have no control over and inflate the value thereof and lend credibility to it. 
Anyway, bitcoin is running on hopium right now, this situation is unsustainable without progress.

I think if what happened in Venezuela right now happened in the US it would be far worse. The Venezuelans have slowly been deprived for years, they are used to regular blackouts even if they are only measured in hours. They are used to food shortages. My power has not went off for a single second in several years, the last time was when a tree fell in a storm on a nearby poll, and only a section of town was without power for a few hours.  I can not complain at all about the quality of my power supply, Thanks AMEREN!
In the US we don't garden much, we are used to 24x7 electricity, internet, everything available now! So, imagine the power went out, people would flip the hell out hard. They don't know how to live without air conditioning, they don't really stock up on non-perishable food, we are out of shape overall, walking around or riding a bike everywhere would be strenuous for most of the US. We are soft... but we got GUNS!!!!! and lots of GUNS!!!!!!, and we have a large sense of entitlement.....

My preference was Rand Paul, and before that Ron Paul for president. 
But I'm against government funded health care and education except for healthcare for kids and the severely disabled. Education costs so much because 1. you can't default on the loans, so they want to get any idiot in college that can sign for a loan. 2. The government gives grants to students and colleges, more free money based on quantity not quality. 3 The goobermint guarantees many of the loans. So, Education is soooo expensive because you have an artificial demand. Colleges are soooo into the government money they make up "Fake" courses just to get the money for it, like gender studies, that's not a real degree that has any worth in society. So, the government guarantees a loan some dumb person can spend on a degree in a useless subject... Piling up debt using up time and space for no net return, that's why costs go up, we are sending millions to college that either have no business being there, or they are studying a subject of no value and questionable legitimacy to begin with.
So, part of taxes goes to pay for that nonsense. 
But before you say but.... the military. I'm pro cutting the military budget to. 
So, why would I identify more with the right than the left, well at least the right pretends they might cut some useless government spending, and sometimes resist more social welfare spending.. The left don't at all, they want more spending on everything all the time, and they "pretend" to not like the military, but obama loved to drone strike families of "suspected" terrorists. So, talk versus action.
Truly, neither party represents me, while the republicans might match my views 30%of the time, I can't think of any current issue I match with the democrats. 
The current democratic party to me is anti-free speech, anti-gun rights.  They are very much concerned with the people living south of the border and people that won't support themselves as well, but don't care at all about the middle class of this country, how do I know that. OBAMACARE... what effect did that have on my health insurance cost they tripled in the couple years after that was enacted, and it doubled immediately. So, the left only cares about those seeking shelter in the bosom of Uncle Sam. So, am I better off with a democrat or a republican that might get rid of Obamacare. I'm far better off with a republican.  Am i going to seek out welfare to go to college nope. 
And before you talk about privilege I was born poor as shit. However, I never looked around and thought those people over there sure need to pay for my education, children, housing, and healthcare, that's what a typical democrat thinks. I can't afford something, man I need to make someone else pay for it. Genius!

I'm not understanding why everyone is hating so hard. If most nodes are run on AMD and INTEL chips, it seems you are already at the mercy of those companies to provide "pure" chips.  I pointed that out long ago, as in Intel could do anything they want if it was worth the price of losing trust in the company forever. 
I'm not seeing how this changes the dynamic much from a "vulnerable" to intel to fuck us standpoint, they already sit in that position for the majority of the network. 
So, if we are already vulnerable to intel and nothing can really be done about that for the foreseeable future, how is relying on a part of that chip going to lead to catastrophe that would/could happen anyway.

It's because the userbase is so small, and 90% of bitcoin is owned by few enough people to fit in a couple buses. Therefore until bitcoin is more distributed in a more rational way it will be at the whims of a few.

What I have would not be the same if I were buying new equipment today. I purchased most of it in 2013-2014. Today, there are more efficient GPU's. However, since I've already covered my cost of equipment, it all comes down to cost of electricity versus bitcoin collected. 
I have some 7950's 750 ti's, 270x's, 7970's, and the newest cards I purchased were GTX 970's. I think the 970's were in 2015, I only have 2 of those though.

That would be a weird reason, as I have 700 GB's free space on the hard drive.

Because batteries are still expensive. Maybe in 10 years when batteries are 1/3 present cost. You can semi mine with solar now though just be grid tied, and all the solar you collect will simply offset your grid power.

I was sympathetic to the 2x cause, and even thinking of going along if a large majority of miners supported it. But Bitcoin Cash happened, and well that should fulfill the wants of 2x supporters. If Bitcoin Cash and larger blocks is the solution to all the ills of bitcoin, then it should take over, slowly over time. So, there is the test bed. 
But this constant forking is unacceptable, it hurts all "versions" of bitcoin. So we have 2 experiments running now, we have the Segwit/lightning/whatever experiment, and the pure big block experiment. My preference is to collect data for a year, then based on that data collected from the real world, then see if a segwit2x type fork is preferable. Sure some devs will be against it always, whatever, some will be for it if it's the path forward. You shouldn't care much what devs want, you should care what I think and the couple hundred thousand bitcoin holders that have a fair amount of bitcoin think. I actively watch nearly all sides of the "Debates", and am not married to a particular group. As in I don't think it's inherently bad to double the blocksize in bitcoin, but I also don't think it's good to double the blocksize just because either, when we do actually have a way of increasing transactions already, and it's best to thoroughly test and then observe one change at a time, as opposed to dealing with multiple changes one after another. 
In other words..... let it rest for a year and observe, we do have time. By then we'll know if lightning pans out well, we'll likely have found any type of oddities in segwit itself, etc.... and we'll see how big blocks works out. It's just to much....

That makes no sense, the bulk of transactions in the real world are under a 1000 bucks, a fee of a 100, would make bitcoin unusable for most of the economy, meaning fiat would reign supreme for most transactions, and therefore since bonds are denominated in the prevailing currency that would mean bonds would be in fiat.

That's why I specified 'verifying only' node.  A node that doesn't have to be updated in seconds of a new block, and doesn't need to transmit it's brand new mined block, really has 10 minutes to download that one block without ill effect on anyone. So, download speed determines that ability. 
Upload is only for propogating to other nodes your blocks, which obviously is necessary, but again you have 10 minutes to transmit at least 1 block to another to be essentially carrying your weight. 
I only have 5 megabit upload, which would mean it'd take me like 16 seconds every 10 minutes to upload a single 10 MB block even.
Conclusion for a node that isn't mining, but simply verifying transactions, bandwidth isn't really an issue for most people. 
The free internet connection at the library near me is even several megabits download over wifi, and surprisingly 4 megabits upload per connected use. Just sayin,

A block is more or less like a tick of a clock, that all the chaos of transactions flowing about must coalesce. If you just attempted to verify every single transaction as you received it, it wouldn't work because I may not have that transaction, and likely would verify a different transaction than you, this would lead to a bunch of different ledgers eventually as people attempted to exploit this lag in the verification system. 
Blocks are the hands of time in bitcoin world. The speed of Blocks cannot be exceeded! 
Or to put it more simply, lag, latency, nodes falling off the network, new nodes joining, lead to chaos in terms of have perfectly identical states at all "human" times, A block forces a Stop and organize situation and increments bitcoin time 1 increment (A block), and everyone can then agree that these particular transactions belong here, despite the fact I have 40,000 other transactions I'm aware of in my memory.

I was kinda joking, but 50BTC *500K is 25 million dollars. Yeah, I could live well the rest of my life off that. I'm not sure where you'd be living, but I'd buy like a 250K house with acreage in the countryside(that's a nice house around here with acreage, though not extravagant), and build a big solar array to, and have well water, and having chickens and a garden. 
So, my monthly basic expenses would be a couple thousand bucks, as would do all my own maintenance work on my property and vehicles myself regardless of income level. 
I'd call that easy street. IF you want to live in a city for some god awful reason probably not. You'd be paying like 2 million for a similiar house with no acreage and a huge property tax bill. Bills, Bills, Bills.
Hell, the 20+ million remaining after acquired everything I could ever want would be split between stocks, btc, silver, gold, platinum, etc... depending on the market condition.
I mean you do realize the "average" us citizen reaches retirement age with 100's of thousands saved up, not millions. 
So, I'd gander I'd be in the upper five percent.
But yeah, I was kidding about the 10K, though that'd put me in a sweet position as far as covering all my basic bills for decades. By that I mean electricity, property taxes, water, car insurance, insurance, clothes, food. 
At 500K / Bitcoin... lol... ummmm, yeah, I'd be wealthier than anyone I know in real life.

That would be a major global disaster, as in if you completely  severed the internet into fragments, that means you lost a bunch of satellites 1000's if not millions of routers. Even likely some fancy communication devices that use non standard methods like radio waves. 
I'd say it'd cost more in damage to the infrastructure than the whole value of all crypto to do such a thing. Really to do such a thing it'd kill all the computers in factories, cars, semi-trucks, ports, etc. etc... So... Trillions in damage would be likely, and it would be temporary in the context of years or decades to recover.
So, what am I doing after such an invent, I'm securing my restore words until things recover in years. Immediately driving (if my car computer didn't die), or biking to the nearest store with whatever money I have and buying all the can goods and long term storage food I can get a hold of in addition to other useful items. I'm then going to stash that under my house, and bike to the houses of people I know and figure out a plan to survive together, as people will begin starving to death in less than a month. 
I've looked up a lot on emp's though. I've water filtration devices, and emergency radio, and fire starting devices etc... and know enough to protect my vital electronics if had a warning of an emp or major solar storm coming, so would have working solar and computers and thus the blockchain to point afterwards if I had like 20 minutes warning beforehand, but as a society a huge solar storm capable of disrupting the bitcoin network, would create hell on earth for at least several years.

We did it!!!, rejoice, oh wait... and then people decided they'd keep breeding until people were starving. There will always be starving people, because people especially uneducated poor people really like to ____.

First, you only incur a tax liability when you sell bitcoin, if you paid for them with after tax dollars, like your income from a job. Simply holding incurs no tax obligation at all. It's just like any other investment in that regard.
 If you EARNED bitcoins as payment for a job, then the value in dollars of that bitcoin is taxed like any other income. I don't this that applies to you though, pretty sure you are in the first situation.
As far as tax obligations at time of sell. (Simply moving to a different wallet, or paper wallet you control is not selling).
Well, you can see in your coinbase account  to find what your purchase price was. Then you use the First In First Out as your standard for applying your sells to the bitcoin. 
(Made up numbers).
So, you purchased Bitcoin like. 
1 bitcoin for 600 on 08/23/2014
1 bitcoin for 800 on 02/24/2015
you spend .01 bitcoin on 07/21/2015. 
So, you start from the oldest bitcoin and work forward. 
So, that .01 is part of your first buy, so .01 x600.00=6.00 cost basis.  On 07/21/2015 the price was 700.00, so .01 x 700=7.00 
So, you realized a profit of 1.00 on the sold portion of your first bitcoin. That was less than a year after you purchased that biction, so it's taxed as Short Term capital gains. 
You have .99 of that bitcoin remaining.  to apply in the same manner to your next purchase with bitcoin or exchange for fiat. 
If you purchased something that required utilizing bitcoin from 2 or more dates to accomplish, like 1.1 bitcoin, then you'd simply do a calculation against each bitcoin or fraction thereof you purchased going from oldest to newest. 
So, you'd consume that .99 bitcoin and calculate as above, then move onto the next bitcoin for .11 of a bitcoin. So, one sell can incur both short and long term capital gains, or a loss, and a gain.
You do have to stick to one method of accounting once you start. I use FIFO (First In First Out ), I believe you can use last in first out to, but you always have to stick to one method FOREVER once you start for obvious reasons. Also, you can't just select to sell an out of order Bitcoin in relation to the accounting method, even if you actually used a bitcoin to pay for something that you acquired later. They all go into a big pile that are only distinguished by the buy date you acquired them on, and you must for accounting purposes treat it like you are selling them from oldest to newest, as they are one asset. 
Not an accountant, lawyer, IRS agent. Just relaying my understanding of the situation. 
As far as what I'd give the accountant it would be a list of the dates I purchased bitcoins on and the dollar value. A list of dates I sold bitcoins and the dollar value, tell him you are using First In First out method, and to treat it like any other property investment.

Who is pushing for more than 21 million coins?? I've not seen them. So, I'll take that as 99.9% of bitcoiners would riot if the 21 million number or issuance rate of bitcoin were ever changed. There is 0.00001% will to "print" more than 21 million bitcoins ever, regardless of bitcoin transaction capacity. 
So, how is not changing the 21 million ever, going to cause inflation? Transaction capacity != coin creation. If bitcoin could handle a 100 transactions / second it'd not effect the 21 million coins. Two separate issues.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:58:58
Well, it certainly would no longer by useful for 99 percent of my purchases. So, yeah, it'd bother bother me. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 09:26:34
you can look up historical bitcoin prices on coinbase. So, just look up the date you "sold/used" your bitcoin, and apply the prevailing price. 
I've imported all the history price history for my own accounting. I just export the history from the bitcoin wallet in csv import that into mysql, and made a web program to match up. I can override the price if I used it like at newegg and there is an explicit dollar value attach to the purchase.

ok, dude, you are nitpicking now. Inflation can be caused by printing money into oblivion, thus causing prices to rise in relation to bitcoin, or inflation can happen for other reasons like uncertainty, which I'm sure your argument is hanging on by a thread. 
Obviously for any honest person they'd realize what I was talking about.

Any change ever to bitcoin can create FUD, and FUD can crash the price so therefore don't change nuffin evar.....

Only piece likely at all would be the hard drive. That machine also mines rock solid never crashes, and that is far more stressful on the cpu/mobo/ram than bitcoin. 
Anyway, it's loading now, that I cleared all the backups. Seems on odd coincidence that the "Shadow copy has reached it's max storage capacity" near the time when bitcoin crashed, and right after I deleted the old automatic backups for windows restore it started working. I already had restarted the computer, previously, so nothing changed but that. Also, It's now working with the original bitcoin directory to, which I never changed a thing. 
Anyway, I'll run checkdisk tonight. I don't have a monitor connected to it, so kind of a pain.

The current plan is for bitcoin not to go mainstream ever. That is what Gold 2.0, store of value is. I know exactly 0.0 people that save with Gold. Which means the vast bulk of the population has no use for bitcoin as Gold, that's the only way to justify forever anemic blocksize. Essentially redefining what bitcoin is for. Most of us apparently were fooled into believing it's more than a glorified inconvenient savings account. 
Bitcoin apparently is not for the regular guy and gal on the street. 
I just hope the price doesn't collapse until after jan 1 2017. I'll likely liquidate everything on jan 1, which will push capital gains into next year. I have exactly 0 uses for gold 2.0, good luck with that though.

Here's what will happen if we stay stagnant. 
The few worthwhile retailers will eventually stop accepting bitcoin, as it's barely worth it with such a small userbase already. No Growth=Virtually no retailers will accept it a few years out. Guaranteed. 
We'll lose more on and off ramps to bitcoin, 100%, companies like coinbase don't make anything off "HODLERS" they make money when people use bitcoin or acquire it. So, bye, bye, several more on off ramps leading to a few highly monitored on off ramps.
With an even worse experience buying bitcoin and less places accepting bitcoin, users will start to migrate to a worthwhile project, leaving bitcoin to languish in its 1 MB glory forever.

Buying with Fiat, no. I do still mine though, and that gets traded for bitcoin. So, in that regard, I acquire more BTC almost everyday. And yes mining even now is still profitable. Still pulling in like 600/month on like 200 in power cost, with my rusty old gpus! You just have to have "relatively" cheap power. 
So, slow accumulation comparatively, but all my hardware was purchased long ago and long ago paid for itself. Really, my only mistake in Bitcoin, and mining has been not doing twice as much of everything I did, to conservative I guess. 
As far as "Selling" yeah, well, I'd have no inclination at all to sell at this time, if we got more transaction capacity. Now, I'm kinda in no mans land in regard to that, seeing how the segwit activation is not going to happen, and also BU has zero chance of becoming the primary standard. No growth, No hold.

Come on man. Anyone can buy a laptop on ebay 10 times more powerful for under a 100 bucks on ebay. Most people can get one for free just by asking friends and family. I have 3 old laptops sitting in a drawer. a single core amd 64, a dual core intel, and the other I don't even remember, my "powerful" laptop is a quad core AMD like 3 years old now. and all of them are FAR more powerful than a raspberry pi and easily upgradable for cheap. And by cheap I mean like 15 dollars for ddr2 sodimm 4GB of ram.
Really? 
A 4 GB ram target is ancient and would seem a rational baseline. If someone can't scrape up a 100 bucks or ask family for an old laptop, they really have bigger problems than running a node. 
I don't get this at all, on one hand people are saying bitcoin is Gold 2.0, and people will put bitcoin in a channel for months at a time and that will facilitate more transaction, which requires excess resources to do, as opposed to spending hand to mouth. Then on the other people say we have to design bitcoin so it can run on the equivalent of a 2004 computer because like "reasons".

In this case in reference to 1MB bitcoin's importance, and the deluded notion a transaction slot will ever be worth 25 dollars. The value case does not exist, nor ever will. Therefore a Delusion.

You pay income tax when you mine the bitcoin whether you spend it or not. You potentially will owe capital gains when you spend that bitcoin if the price went up since you mined it. 
So. today you mine 1 bitcoin you'd owe tax on 6138 dollars of ordinary income. You hold that bitcoin to 2020 and it's worth 100K, you'd owe capital gains on the difference 100K-6138 at the long term capital gains rate.

I actually agree with Peter Todd on bitcoin inflation, as in if could go back in time, and instead of reducing the new supply forever, eventually it would simply inflate at 1% rate forever, that was actually my concern with bitcoin when I first heard of it in 2010. Of course it's to late now, and I'm against changing it, but it is a flaw IMO. Hodlers still benefit from the security mining provides, even if they don't transact. The inflation would in effect make all pay for security to some degree. 
Hopefully transaction fees will be enough to sustain mining when the block reward gets trivially small.

Nicehash, is GPU mostly, and GPU mining is typically more profitable than mining with bitcoin asics. IF you were to start GPU mining today and were going to buy new hardware to do it. You buy a vega 56 or 64 or a 1070 or 1080 most likely. If you already have a fairly new gpu like a 580 480, etc... you can still mine profitably.  IF you were going mine bitcoin directly you need an asic miner like the s9 sold by bitmain.

you can't really do it, until you have widespread adoption, and the price stabilizes. 
If you had a billion people using bitcoin, getting paid in bitcoin, etc... the price would be much less volatile. Over time, whales will sell off portions to either live the good life, or chase more speculative ventures. 
Imo, that'll take decades. 
You could also partially solve the problem with electronic price labels using e-ink or whatever they made the original kindle with.

if(CurrentBlockNUM mod BlocksBetweenAdjustment ==0)
	AvgTransactionSize=AVG(transactionsize) last 1000 or however many would think appropriate to get a good avg.
	Week_transaction_Capacity=(CurrentBlockSize/AvgTransactionSize)*NumBlocksInWeek;
	BlockFillTarget=.8;// 80% capacity utilization would infer a large portion of the day blocks would be completely full thus promoting reasonable but probably not excessive fees, you could still send transactions for cheap if you wanted to wait a bit. 
	LowFillthreshold=.7;
	if((BlockFillTarget*week_transaction_Capacity)&lt;WeeksTotalTransactionCount)
	{
 	 Blocksize=(Blocksize*1.25);

you are paying for the us state as you put it when you use the us dollar. The dollar is inflated  away a bit every single year you know. That essentially is a wealth transfer to the US government. They print it. They know that and actively ensure the dollar remains the "money" standard of the world. bomb bomb bomb libya........... Iraq, probably Iran eventually.... etc......
So, difference between bitcoin and the dollar I suppose is our inflationary arm goes to miners which some of which attack us. So... what to do... In the US, government at least has the decency to destroy or hamper anyone that attempts to harm its "cash cow", unlike in bitcoin where stupid ass little d**k communist fascist ftards with napoleon complexes attack the very thing supplying them.

It'd probably be easier, to buy a place in the country, set up some motion activated video monitoring devices, and then get a quickly detachable power line attached before it hits the meter. The detachable power line would be controlled by a computer, that would trigger the clamp release and reeling the wire back in. 
You could set that up actually pretty easily. As long as the property was fairly isolated, and you didn't get a lot of false positives for encroachment resulting in automatic power line detachment and retraction.

if you create a new wallet without saving your old wallet you would, as in if you delete your old wallet and create a new one. Just because you create a wallet on the same computer using the same software doesn't mean it'll create the same wallet you had before. 
What you do in bitcoin or all of crypto is you backup your wallets. If you have a trezor you keep a couple copies of your restore words in separate locations.

Cohen has teamed up with early bitcoin exchange Tradehill’s COO Ryan Singer and they’ve raised a seed round for Chia to ramp up hiring. Cohen wouldn’t say how much it had raised, laughing that, “I’m not sure how much we want to announce right now, but it was a very hot round.” The goal is do some early sales of Chia in Q2 2018, with a full launch of its cryptocurrency by the end of 2018, though Cohen says that’s a stretch goal.

Blah, I looked into bitcoin in 2010! I still actually am using my wallet from way back then(upgraded the sofware of course). We were kinda broke, though I asked my business partner about buying a 1000.00 dollars worth, and said we'd either be millionaires or out of a 1000 bucks in a few years. Well, we didn't do it, that would have been worth over a million bucks, and nope wouldn't have sold for dollars either, because the whole idea was to buy and just wait a few years for hundreds of dollars because it was obvious it'd fail or be worth a lot. 
Anyway, if we were doing a bit better in 2010, I'd have just purchased it myself, and would be a rich bastard right now, but instead didn't mess with bitcoin again for years. 
Sad.....

Why don't you instead tell me how the present "oversized" blocksize hurts me? My upload speed has doubled in the last few years, hard drive prices have fallen. I have no problem having a bitcoin node online. Why would I want the blocks to have less capacity? It makes no sense. 
I really don't care about bitcoin running on a raspberry pi, I think that is a dumb standard. I really don't see using the blocksize as financial lever either like some kind of perverse federal reserve style market manipulation tool to jack up transaction fees. And nope I don't even care if bitcoin can't be used properly over a 56K modem, that seems to be his hang up. He wants bitcoin to run even if nuclear bombs are flying and we are reduced to morris code beeps over shortwave radio,
Smaller blocks will allow less people to use bitcoin though, that's just a fact. Unless you consider fake bitcoin IOU's on centralized exchanges and sites to be bitcoin equivalents which could then stand in for bitcoin proper in the normal use situations. Even lightnings userbase is ultimately limited by the base bitcoin block size. 
In short I want room for more bitcoin users not less.

Yes it is. I mined yesterday .1 BTC. My monthly power bill including all my personal non-mining usage was 272 dollars. 
So, .1x30=3 BTC x 270=810 mined.
Really it's between .08 and .11 per day.
I've everything undervolted with flashed bios of course except the 750ti's I just run them stock, also, use variable priced hourly electricity. Also have a server setup to wake on lan the mining computers, and shut them down completely when the electricity price rises above a set price. 
Also use an arduino with a temperature sensor and a relay to control a power outlet which the fans are plugged into, so they don't run constantly either. 
Anyway, it's profitable for me.

It'd take very very long to get anywhere near a 1GB block.

I really wish bitcoiners wouldn't lie, to try to rouse the market. Bitcoin is at 255, there is no rush into bitcoin. Miniscule increase that is fading. That's the truth. 
Greeks can't even buy bitcoin with their 60 Euros a day slave allotment. and the other countries in europe aren't "rushing" either, if they were price would surge obviously.

@_date: 2015-07-14 15:08:28
what you do is diversify. 
Here's how. You install a bitcoin wallet on your primary computer and a wallet on your secondary computer. Now it appears you have unbalanced portfolio, as you have 21 bitcoins all on your primary. So, you need 21 on the secondary computer as well, then you will have spread your investment in two different locations and diversified your holding of bitcoins.

1 290x will not earn you anywhere near 1 BTC a month, no matter what you mine. 
I have a bunch of gpus still mining, and I only pull in like .1 BTC / day, and half of that is eaten by electricity cost, and I have everything individually undervolted. Also on variable priced electricity, and have it automatically shutdown all computers except the server when price spikes, but 90% of the time they run for cheaper rates than most are paying.

There are 10's of millions of people in the US alone that have connections exceedingly faster than required for 8 MB blocks. Kansas City has 1 gigabit up and down, that is available to several 100,000 people and there only a handful of full nodes there, and that is one city. Full Nodes last I looked were like 6000 worldwide. 
The problem is bitcoin doesn't have enough users. There are plenty of idle fat connections in the world to get us to 10's of thousands of full nodes even with bigger blocks. It's just they aren't interested.
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:54:54
Systems like this gain their value both financially and socially from their userbase counts. Security that sacrifices user count in an extreme way to protect against a very unlikely event is not a good trade off. Sure it'd be nice if bitcoin was usable during a nuclear war, but really I think I'll be worried about other things if shit got that bad. If you parented in the same way luke wants to protect bitcoin, you'd cage your child into a padded cage in a fireproof room to sit alone in perpetual safety.

But, if blocks where 20 MB's it'd take the exact same amount of electricity as 1 MB blocks, and in theory for 20 x the transactions, same for 100 MB or 1 GB blocks. 
But it's true, Bitcoin as is has an irrational amount of hashing power for it's present transaction volume. I think there will be a Huge shakeout during the next block halving, and probably like 30% drop in network hashrate, unless we increase "real" transactions dramatically before then, I see little chance of that happening with 1 MBer's running the show.

1. A country recognizing Bitcoin as a national currency beside their other primary currency. Mainly all that does is allow for a complete and total ecosystem to form where you could in theory transact everything including taxes in bitcoin, and would also eliminate notions of capital gains in that country. So, obviously a lot of companies and bitcoins would rush there, and a buttload of activity would commence. 
2. Breakthrough that would allow dramatic increase in internet speeds, which would in theory lead to larger blocks, and relieve the concern over maximum network capacity of traditional bitcoin transaction in the near term future.

I don't know, I do think they are conservative to the point of making a nun look like a stripper in comparison. 
However, Segwit will give us some breathing room, I'm fairly certain most of the network will upgrade rapidly, seeing the cost for transactions will be cheaper using it. 
Then if we can get some kind of thin blocks implementation going, well, that will "flatten" the bandwidth demand, essentially lowering the requisite peak bandwidth required to run a mining full node. So, after that there is little argument left not to increase the blocksize. 
Then lightning can do what they are trying to do with that for microtransactions. 
It seems to me that should be done in 2016 or a worst early 2017.

1. I was talking about dictatorships. A LEGITIMATE leader, as in an elected leader granted temporary authority by the people in specific areas of government,  that is required to be renewed utilizing legitimate elections, would not be a dictator.  The wisdom of the 10000 is not them all deciding every decision but electing someone to do a job for a period of time. IF they make a mistake the guy can be removed, if he does a good job they'll reelect him
No man is wiser than 10000 other men combined, that's absurd, and you should be ashamed to let such idiocy lurk in your brain. You have visions of god kings. 
I'm not going to go down the infinite rabbit hole of what if Hitler won, Only a pure idiot would think he could know what would happen in an alternate reality. 
A dictator doesn't have any meaningful counter balance in other branches of government, that's the whole point of a dictatorship, they have puppets that feign a functioning government.   Putin is Russia, there is no other power of consequence. If he wants you dead you die, if he wants your land the state acts on his behalf to seize it, etc..... 
Putin is not the President, that is just a false title, he's a dictator. Russia should be so proud to have such a wise god king wiser than 10000 other men combined!!! LOL. 
Why don't you google all the countries run by dictatorships.... They are nearly all complete shitholes, and nearly all are oppressive, and the ones that aren't will likely become shit holes again, as dictatorships, like communism tend to produce that result over time.

No, it's all about the patent and asicboost. 
Bitmain is free to block anything they want for selfish reasons, there is no rule that miners have to be rational or agree to anything. You or I could not like that, but that doesn't mean it violates any 'rule'. 
If however, someone did have an exclusive patent and therefore the sole right to use it to give themselves a permanent 20+% advantage, well that breaks the mining ecosystem. If Bitmain doesn't have exclusive rights to the patent and is using it illegally well, then hope the asicboost patent holders sue them into oblivion.  Either way patents and mining don't mix, it leads to a single centralized asic producer.

miners would have a fit, and quite possibly cash out completely, and as a bonus wreak havoc on the blockchain before their final exit. Recoverable technically most likely but the damage would be immense in a economic and social sense. 
I'd probably do it though, Mining centralization is the largest threat to Bitcoin IMO, beyond govs, hackers, etc...  Target hardware should be 3 GB+ video cards, CPU mining is to prone to bots. Then I'd schedule a vote on the next algo to occur every 2 years thereafter, with a mandatory change.
I'd love to mine bitcoin it's just not practical, I wouldn't mind mining at a very slight profit, but as is I'm better off using my old extreme undervolted cards paid for 2 years ago to mine ether and trade for BTC. It's insanity, not sure how long I can rationalize the present situation.

If you look at the chart at the bottom of the page the rate of increase was decreasing  over time. But so what? It's still increasing, and putting all the costs on middle class people and higher, and nearly all the benefit to degenerates. 
An increase is an increase. It still is increasing, and looking at the page you gave, it doesn't look like that rate of change was much benefited by obamacare. FYI the rate of increase increased in 2015 using your own chart, and is higher than in 2008,2009,2010, before obamacare had any effect at all. All obamacare did was shift the cost of insurance from the degenerate takers to the middle and upper class and pretend they are paying for their own healthcare.
Edited to add. A successful healthcare reform act, would REDUCE cost for either equal or better treatment.

I think a good "rule" would be bitcoin will attempt to block any patented optimization. 
So, what that means is essentially you can do whatever you want in terms of efficiency optimizations, as long as it doesn't involve government enforcing your optimization(that is the consequence of a patent).
So, if you discover an efficiency enhancement. You can either keep it secret and use it, or you can share it with the public. Just don't involve governments as your protector.
OF course there are other rules like you can't ignore another miners results unless the block is invalid, or exclude a miner from participating in a high speed relay network..Etc..
Force of government has no place in mining. Period. End of Story.

All dictatorships are evil, save for the dictator that willing gives control to the people and ceases being a dictator, that's a benevolent dictator.
If you are a dictator even if you want the best for your people, 1. you are not going to live forever, and you can not ensure whoever follows will have the same intention, so you're just setting up your population for the future tyrant, thus you are causing a future tyrant to occur, not very benevolent. 2. People are very self delusional, a dictator may think he's benevolent, while living in his billion dollar estate, sipping on champagne hunting down enemies of the people, even Hitler thought he was doing good, who decides what is benevolent. There is a reason the sloppy system by which leaders are elected works best in the long term, it dulls the emotion of the moment, and feeds in innumerable perspectives. A dictatorship relies upon the wisdom of one singular man, and only a narcissist would believe one man can be more wise than 100's.

Let's say they manage to get lightning to work without any hardfork being required, let's say lightning increases user capacity 10 FOLD..

I see no excuse from the "core" position not to come to some agreement for regular blocksize increases. 1.15 multiplier applied yearly to the base block size seems more than rational, considering that is actually less than the rate of growth of internet speed. 
Integrate that or something similiar to be activated a year from now, and I'd say the crypto wars are over.

how much free electricity.?
Don't listen to people telling you it wouldn't be worth it, I'd be raking in 1000's a day if I had free electricity in large quantity. 
First. Forget mining bitcoin directly, you'd GPU mine altcoins and trade them for BTC, that's more profitable, plus can recoup like up to 1/2 the hardware cost if shit hit the fan, and had to liquidate. I have some 750 ti's for example I'm going to sell and replace with GTX 1080 that have been mining since 2014, still going to recoup 60-70 / card on an initial investment of less than a 150/card and that is after mining them 24/7 for over 2 years. So, on those I'm going to get back like 40% of cost. Whereas the value of an s9 in 2 1/2 years will be novelty value.
I'd move to russia if had a megawatt/hr of reliable free electricity!!!!!!

The only way solar makes sense for your everyday joe in relation to mining is if you have a very good grid connect solar program provided by your utility. As if they will credit you for day usage that you can use at night, but you'll still be paying the transmission fee/kilowatt even on the banked credits. 
In that scenario, it could be good. But I doubt it's going to work out well, for him. He really, really needs to look up the mining returns taking into account difficulty. 
IMO, he'd be better off just buying bitcoins. Unless he really wants a large solar installation anyway.

That last pretense of capitalism was washed away in 2008. We don't have capitalism. If we did Most of the large financials would have disappeared back then. It's not like we haven't been marching towards the merger of government and corporations for decades, and simultaneously forcing the citizens to buy products, and services many don't want. Social Security is forced, Obamacare is forced, mandatory car insurance. Why pretend, our economic system year after year is drifting to total control by the Government via its sock puppet corporations, or if you prefer to look at the situation in reverse as if it matters. Corporations are controlling the Sock puppet politicians that enact whatever they wish, that's the problem right, government sees "some" corps as extensions of itself, and many corps rely on government to protect its position.

It's blocking segwit for disingenuous selfish reasons
That is what the OP posted. My point is that blocking segwit for disingeuous selfish reasons is not against the rules to participate in mining. It may be shitty, but it's not a violation of anything.  It also is in the long term irrational to block segwit like that but again there is no rule that one must be rational to mine either. 
So, one can not make a code change based on that criteria the OP posted, because it's not against any rules.
What is against the "rules" is Centralizing bitcoin, and a patent like ASICBoost given to one party would do just that in the long term, which is why I say it's more about the patent than the mind set of a miner.  Bitcoin coders are 100% justified in protecting bitcoin from centralization via patent law.

Point is , because of the drastically increased cost I'm forced to pay because of obamacare, the likely hood of me going bankrupt in the future is actually greater, because thousands of dollars is stolen from every year. 
Again your leftist logic, you only focus on one side of the equation and ignore the harm you cause.
OBAMACARE has INCREASED healthcare costs, you're ignoring that, only focusing on the SUBSIDIZED premiums of part time applebees workers. IT HAS INCREASED.
THE INCREASED costs, have a direct effect on my finances in a negative direction, which means personally it has INCREASED the odds I might enter a situation in the future that forces me to declare bankruptcy. Leftists always ignore the payer harm, and focus on the takers benefit. 
Again, Leftists don't care about the HARM they cause, as they focus on benefiting their base of takers.

No bitcoin will need to "mutate" to become something worthwhile, as it is near useless as is. Pure speculation. I think if it becomes clear that bitcoin will remain as is forever, you'll see all the hopium that has driven bitcoin thus far dissipate rather quickly.

That's one of my cards. 
YEah.. I do have cheaper power than a lot of people though. 
Example: one rig that still has 3 750 ti's is making 1.30/day (just from the 750 ti's) as of now that rig also has a GTX 1080. I have a real time Volt/Amps meter installed in an outlet I made, and that shows total system power draw at the socket to be 3.2 amps. 
120 volts x 3.2 amps = 384 total system power. 
So.. .384 kilowatts x 24=9.216 Kilowatt hours / day. 
9.216 x .08 cents (higher than actual price) = 0.73728 total power cost including the 1080. 
I do have the 1080 power limited down a bit though for heat reasons. 
The 1080 produces more than all 3 of the 750 ti's combined.
So, just the 750 ti's cover the power cost plus some, the 1080 is all profit(well, after cover it's cost in like 200 days, lol). 
So, the 750 ti's don't make much anymore, that's why I'm going to replace them. 
I also still mine with 7950's I got in 2014!!! still profitable, pretty good profitable still actually, I undervolted them of course to get better hash/watt and lower heat output, but those are all humming along still, though I did have lots of bad fans on those and had to put case fans on them with zip ties to keep em goin!!!

A rapid collapse of the dollar would be bad for nearly everyone, everywhere. Foreign countries have US 30 year bonds which could not all be traded away without huge losses, the dollar is the standard unit used in trade for a huge section of the world. The US is a huge consumer of Chinese goods(and Europe, and Canada, and MExico, etc), which means China would without a doubt enter a recession at best likely a depression, as china is also stacking up the debt to fuel its economy. Investors all over the world hold US stocks as well, which would hurt them enormously. The lowered demand for oil which happens in a depression would send many middle east countries into a depression, not to mention venezuela. Plus much more.
Unless you want global depression, you don't want the dollar to fall in a 7-10 year period, you'd want it to happen slowly over decades which gives time for a gradual winding down of dollar exposure. Minmum time IMO to "dedollarize" the world safely would likely be 30+ years.

I really don't think we'll see 3K, likely ever again. 2020-2021 is when I think we'll see the insane bull market. But I'm notorious for my predictions to be off by months. So, maybe this is the beginning of the most epic bullrun ever, or not. I think it's coming though. 
Fun Facts.
Only 600K people mining identical to me, and I'm a small miner, would completely absorb all bitcoin created at the present rate. There are home operations several times bigger than mine, and small commercial operations that are likely a 100 times bigger, and those mega mining facilities are likely a 1000 + times bigger than me. 
Every single Satoshi I mine, at present, is Held, It would seem to me that is likely the situation most small miners are functioning under. 
Anyway, my gut says the supply is insufficient.

I feel kinda bad, I actually ended up more than tripling my investment. I purchased some "hashlets" at the very beginning before it was obvious it was a scam. Well, then he started pumping up the payouts and the hashlet pricing presumably to get a hype cycle going, and just looking at the numbers, I knew by then it wasn't real. At the beginning the numbers were "rational", not by the end. So, sold out, and did tell others it wasn't real either, but that got me "shadowbanned". 
So, I got lucky, I don't do anything to do with "virtual" mining contracts anymore. I either mine myself or don't.

Well, one full node per small community would be an improvement compared to the current situation. I live in a 20,000 person town, and guess what, I'm the only full node. The nearest full node to me, is in the next largest town probably around 35,000 people. Many other towns around ranging from 500 to 10000 have zero full nodes. 
So.... would it be better to have 10 times the users, and one node in towns that have none now, or as it is at present to where 90+% have zero. 
Oh I also have a all you can eat ISP, with 100 Mb download, and all the towns around me have the same ISP available and still I'm the only one. LOL.

Syncing is essentially downloading the whole blockchain. So, if you use bitcoin core, yeah, you have to sync. 
There are ways to import your private key into other bitcoin wallets, but I only use bitcoin core or derivatives thereof, and my trezor. You'd be better off asking someone else if you go the route of exporting and importing your private key to a "less" data intensive wallet.

With the hiring of Mow at Blockstream the conspiracy that they are a government operation to simply destroy bitcoin almost seems plausible. Maybe core really does want progress, I can't see any company that would employ Mow as having good intentions however. 
On a scale of -10 to 10 with 10 being angelic intent, and -10 being a traditional bank. The addition of Mow to any org, is an automatic -2. 
No honest person can argue against the view, that mow is a divisive troll, that's it. Why in the world would you hire someone that adds absolutely nothing but vitriol to a debate.

No one really knows, but..... people pretend other things are predictable as well, as in, in 4 years, there is also a non-trivial chance facebook could be down 90% or more, all it takes is one security breach at the right time, or a competitor with deep pockets and superior product, or zuckerburg could be caught on tape banging a 12 year old, or etc.... etc.. tec... Same for google, same for amazon, same with nearly every "software" based company or thing on the planet. The most likely to be here and relatively stable is microsoft imo, simply because of the installed base, and huge effort it would take to unseat the OS. 
 
Investing is all based on probability, not surety. 
Most likely,IMO, bitcoin is not over, development is still active, progress is being made, the new supply will also reduce in 2020, Every year that goes by teenagers  turn to adults with jobs and income and a vote and the idea of bitcoin isn't crazy to most of them, and the old naturally dwindle, and those are the most against crypto in general. 
So, the day to day winds blow one way or another, but the general direction isn't against cryptocurrencies in general. 
In my head it's like 80-90% chance bitcoin will reach another all time high in the next 4 years.

I've been aware of bitcoin since 2010, and received my first fraction of a bitcoin in 2010 been watching it ever since. 
wealth redistribution is a socialist/communist term meaning taking from one person by force or threat and giving it to another deemed worthy by an authority. 
That's why the "RE" is in front of distribution. 
Bitcoin is "distribution" agnostic. It has no power mechanism to "RE" Distribute what another has. Whoever has the mining power and luck get the mining reward, and if you own the private keys you own the coins. 
Where "redistribution" comes in is beyond me. 
There is a lot of talk of giving the power of the banks to the people, but that's not what is commonly referred to as wealth redistribution.

Time to synch depends on your internet connection, CPU speed, and how much ram is devoted to bitcoin core. If you have enough ram set dbcache=Megabytes in your bitcoin.conf file, and shutdown bitcoin core and start it again. I think the default dbcache is like 300 MB now. More ram will speed it up. like dbcache=2000
You probably should backup your wallet now to, just in case. 
Your coins will be there when it's done syncing, as long as you sent them to the correct address. I had to totally redownload the whole blockchain before because of corruption, and they show up whenever they are found in a block, which in your case is close to the last block.

So, in that regard I support the us dollars, sorta like a woman consents to sex with a gun against her head. Rational people call that rape, and rational people call what the us government does mafia type behavior. The US government provides almost no useful service to it's TAX paying citizens compared to the amount paid in. 
US taxes go to Military, welfare for old people, and interest on the debt, and government employees to watch porn at work when they aren't plotting to fuck over the average citizen. A few percent of the taxes goes towards roads, infrastructure.

All governments have to do is ban bitcoin, then all the exchanges close, it becomes stupid hard to convert to fiat, price collapses to pennies, miners shut down, security is shot, Bitcoin dies. 
The only chance bitcoin ever had long term was wide adoption, as then there would be some political pain inflected if they tried to ban it. 
Even if you "hide" the whole bitcoin network it'd do jack shit to change the outcome. Eventually people will want to exchange bitcoin for fiat, then your dream collapses. How are you going to buy a house with illegal bitcoin? How are you going to buy food with illegal bitcoin. Do you seriously believe we'll all be sneaking around the park at night doing cash exchanges. LOL. Absurdity.

I'm pretty sure, they aren't going to use their blockchain as a native "value" store, but rather as a way to ensure no one can modify the entries once submitted. Essentially a ledger where the value preservation doesn't matter, but rather the immutability of the entries matter. They'll just examine the chain to ensure it comes out correct, as in correct according to their agreements at the time to what correct should be between the banks, and that correction will simply be an adjustment in the next block.
So, it solves for them, the problem of making sure all participants are looking at the same raw dataset.

That kind of thing only happens in failed(failing) states. 
Why? Well, because if in the US where I live, if they shut the internet completely down, that is essentially shutting the whole economy down nearly instantly. Almost all economic activity is routed over the "internet". Even phone calls are over the internet now, there is no seperate system for that anymore. I have a home phone service and guess what it's voip. Now, maybe there are a few old phone systems out there somewhere but the vast majority now aren't tunneled over the internet like everything else. 
So, imagine a situation where the Internet in the US is shutdown. You will not be worried about bitcoin, or your USD, or your gold, you'll be worried about not getting killed or raped by roaming gangs. People will within 24 hours start looting stores everywhere. The US would be over effectively. No credit cards would work, even the power companies would be screwed as more and more smart meters roll out, deliveries of all forms would stop as those are communicated via the internet. Banking would not work without the internet at all, no atms, no bank wires, no going to your local branch for cash. You couldn't even attempt to route via phone because those are internet to!.  The police couldn't look up any info using their computers in their cars, 911 wouldn't work, fire services would not be reachable. ETc....   
In short without hours of the internet going down in total, chaos would ensue, and the only reason for the government to do that, would be if the country was in chaos already as was the case in the above article.
Everything would just STOP economically. 
So, how are you supposed to use bitcoin at the end of the world. Who fucking cares. Think about it. 
'But ignoring the fact that you'd be worried about bitcoin as the country goes up in flames. I'd say the only way would be via an internet connection not under control of the failed government state in question. Satellite phone modem could work, long distance radio communication to a non-failed nation. But who cares, the country will not be burning already before we get to that point.

Doubt it, Gold can be seized easily, At least with bitcoin once you get to a place with internet you can restore you wallet with a 24 word phrase.
The problem is, with these types of questions, they seem to ignore the reality, that civilization has effectively broken down by the point the scenario in question has happened.
So, yeah, you could try to horde gold, but no store will be open to barter with, there will be no police force at all to prevent or punish someone slitting your throat for your gold. Advertising your gold for trade would be suicidal, until some semblance of law was restored which likely would coincide with restored internet access anyway, or until you left the nation.
In such a scenario the best strategy would be to pretend to be as poor and starving as possible blending in, so not to be a target, and concealing any assets you have until some order is restored.
It's a no win scenario when governments do these things.
So, my advice if you live in a country where such is likely. Store up on food, and essentials, and hide it someplace, and don't tell anyone about it. You have just as good a chance of trading a few cans of spaghetios for  something as you would with gold, probably better, as after awhile people will start to go hungry, and at least if you get robbed during a trade you only lost a little bit. Or don't trade during the period and keep to yourself in your home surrounded by family and friends and arm yourself until it ends.

The water doesn't get "hot" hot. It will get to the bottom range of what I consider Hot. Comfortable for showers.

You could in theory do this, kind of. 
Imagine a psuedo-bitcoin as the underbelly essentially, it records all changes to the blockchain, but wouldn't concern itself with the value aspect of the accounting. So, the blockchain would be able to record the entries, but it wouldn't verify the tally of the tokens. So, all the entries would be immutable, but then you could have a "central" authority that could insert new value entries at the end of the chain to "correct" or "fix" or "return" token values for whatever reason. 
So, you'd have a blockchain that forever showed what was done, but it wouldn't 100% enforce the "correctness" of the value token itself. 
Not something I'd necessarily want, but it could give an "open book" that wasn't prone to Hidden tampering.

For that reason even if bitcoin proper died, I'd still never throw in with the bitcoin cash people. They think they are "winning" by deceiving newbs, but they alienate even more , and more importantly the vast majority of old school bitcoiners. 
They best outcome Bitcoin Cash could achieve now would be a Pyrrhic victory. They should really just stop the childish antics.

IF I lived in Africa I'd likely live there. Why? Well, because it's common for whites to be targeted for attack by the majority black population. Sure whites did wrongs in the past over there, but today, it's reversed completely. South Africa is a racist country. Period, but since it's against white people now, the world ignores it nearly completely. It's gross.

Ethereum isn't named Bitcoin Extreme. Also Ethereum isn't a fork from bitcoin.
As in a situation where you have "Bitcoin", Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Real, Bitcoin MEga, etc... only confuses things for newbs. Plus since most of these forks would use the exact same mining algo, it moves hashrate from the "bitcoin" chain. If that happens enough, and the hashrate is spread out over multiple coins which would lower the bitcoin difficulty, and make it easier to attack.

Good rule of thumb for bitcoin investing, is to add up your total net worth. Then divide that by 2, and purchase as many bitcoins you can with that money. Then you put them on your trezor or ledger hardware wallet, and put that someplace safe, and come back in 5 years and see it's now 90% of your net worth.

If I were core I'd get ahead of these things, IMO, they should be working on the .17 increase per year hardfork proposed long ago, and get that integrated to activate in year after, then no one could argue anymore that bitcoin will never grow, and take all the fire away from the big blocks now crowd.

I don't, I simply don't believe millions of new users have been added in a few months. Maybe fake user accounts that don't buy anything have been added representing the bulk of that user count.
However, if coinbase alone has added millions of "real" users in the last months, where is all that btc they are buying coming from? Sure some will buy .1 BTC or even .01 btc, but some would be buying 1+BTC, is there really a 100,000 Plus excess BTC available on the gdax market to feed those supposed buy orders on top of the demand from all the previous users, not  to mention that most other exchanges would be seeing growth as well and more demand for BTC. 
There is a fixed supply of BTC as everyone knows, and most isn't up for trade at any given time, none of mine is on an exchange for example. I just don't see how the price would be "steady" if you are adding millions of new users a month, makes no sense at all. 
The numbers just don't make sense to me, at that kind of growth rate they're claiming, I'd expect well over 10,000/ BTC already, and if that growth rate were 'real' and continued the price would spiral out of control, as there are only so many people that want to sell their BTC, eventually you have to drive the price up alot to entice hodlers to sell to the "million" new users. 
Where are the sellers coming from? Are there really enough people will to depart with their btc to supply a million new users month after month after month with even .01 btc all while the price is flat.
Makes no sense, I'd believe it if the price were going up in line with user counts roughly, which it isn't.

2x blocksize increase is the dumbest method to scale bitcoin, or any  one time bump really, the argument will just pop up again a year later for even larger blocks and back at step 1 all over again. 
The only rational approach is x percent growth per year, and the x should be a lower percentage than the growth rate of the reliant technologies.  So, 15, 17 percent, somewhere in that range. And in that proposal likely there should be some mechanism to abort the growth rate, like if 50% of the blocks over a few difficulty adjustment periods flag some code. Who knows maybe bandwidth will stop growing in 2030, whichever.

Looking at my area, the red counties are pretty well farm land, with a few 100-1000 sized "villages" in them.

So mostly that map is showing farmland versus towns and cities.

For casual readers. I mine alts and trade for BTC or use nicehash for autocovert to btc, not mine btc directly with gpus.
I would just keep mining if you have cheap power, mining profitablity ebbs and flows. I've been mining since 2013 all the way to today. It sucked back then when my cards were only mining .04 btc / day. lol. and that was with far less cards. So. $200/ day+ in todays BTC prices. Yeah, I could have purchased BTC directly. But I mined all the way through the 2015 lows collecting my little daily reward, and still mining to the highest highs. I'm not really sure I'd have come out ahead buying btc directly now.  My 7950's are still mining profitably actually, not much but still going so that's since late 2013-2017 everyday 24/7 mining small amounts. I'd guess they've mined a whole Bitcoin by now each. i do also have 1080's 1070's 480's 580 etc.... 7950 is just my oldest for example.
But that really depends on power costs, and if you undervolted etc... all my old cards are heavy undervolted and slightly underclocked to increase their efficiency, they'd be negative if ran at stock. I just can't let them die!!!! they are like my children, must keep them going profitability as long as possible!! 
That said, with the current inflated card prices I can't see expanding or starting mining new, but if already have a rig and the economics work at least you have some form of skin in the crypto-mining game, and if anything have a better grasp of the system.

Sure it's related. Bitmain is pushing Bitcoin Cash, while at the same time signaling for S2X. 
Why do you think they'd push 2 forks at the same time? They are pushing anything that will degrade bitcoin proper. If Bitmain honestly was merely pushing for a better bitcoin, they certainly wouldn't be pushing multiple implementations at the same time. 
My conclusion is Bitmain is attempting to gain control, Bitmain controls the Bitcoin Cash chain, so they win if that chain gains support, and S2x if that chain wins, they gain more control as that will be a coin totally and forever controlled by the whims of miners, and guess who is the biggest miner. Bitmain. 
Bitmain isn't concerned with decentralization,or the well being of bitcoin, they are plotting for control. Nothing more. 
So, yeah Bitcoin Cash happened and Bitmain showed their hand. 
And Segwit2x is all about miners controlling all the legs of bitcoin at the same time. No more miners/devs/community/business. It turns to miners/business.

No way whatsoever is that true. That would be 28 million in the US alone that owns some crypto. Just look at the coin distribution charts. The only way that could be true, is if we are talking like .0001 counting as an investment. If 28 million in the us alone,that would mean like a 100 million+ worldwide. Hogwash. I still have not met a person in the "wild" that owns bitcoin. I'm also the only node in the the towns around here, pretty much I'm the only node for like a 1/3 of the state. So, that's 100's of thousands of people and I'm the only node. If 8% of the population or 28 million held bitcoin you'd expect more nodes. even 1 percent of 28 million  would be 280,000 nodes just for the us, or if 1 in a 1000 that'd be 28,000 nodes for the us alone.

Or core could simply add a scaling solution. I think 2x is dumb, not because 2x is dangerous, but because it's a one off solution and only offers temporary resolve. 
Increasing the block size variables by x percent a year would seem a rational approach 15-20% is a reasonable range. Also, to be a bit safer require at least 60% of mined blocks to signal desire for larger blocks or else the increase is paused for that period. 
IMO, if bitcoin survives the 2x battle, a solution similar to the above would take the edge off the scaling battle.

I still make around 2.00/card sometimes over 3 a day sometimes even lower than 2 bucks a day off my 1080's
my whole setup brings in like 1500-1900 / month still. my power bill is less than 400.00, that is for all non-mining as well. 
That's far less than it used to be, but it's still profitable. As usual have to point out have lower than average cost per kilowatt.  And also I haven't expanded or upgraded at all since the card price spike that seems to never end. I paid 400 essentially for my 1080's when had ebay buck sales or good deals on slickdeals.

Well, I eagerly await clarification from the IRS. The way I did it is assign the Shitcoin BCH a value of 0 and the acquisition date as the fork date then sold it all and figured short term capital gains on it as the tax. 
Which from the IRS perspective in terms of taxes is actually better for them as short term capital gains rates are rape. But at least that way, if the IRS goes the rational route, I wont' be out of compliance for simply not knowing a new shitcoin came into existance, and I also won't have to infinitely keep having to reevaluate my cost basis, which is the real killer for me, seeing as if I conitinue to hold bitcoin, I will in a couple years have to track 10's of shitcoins, and there values, and every single btc I receive will have to have it's own calculation for cost basis depending upon which shitcoins were created after I acquired it. 
It really is accounting inception.

I'd be surprised, that type of price I'd guess would be after 2020. But I'm not the best at predicting this stuff, I'm to rational. Just to maintain 6000 USD / BTC around 7.4 Billion USD would have to come into the market between now and april 2020, just to absorb new bitcoins being mined to the halvening, that seems like a lot to me and an achievement in itself, after that yeah likely price rise, as it's doubful the inflow of cash would simply stop after for no reason.  
However, I did not expect a rise to 20K either, so.... who knows.

Not sure what you mean by starting point. 
Do you mean the blockweight/size. IT'd be the present sizes. 
If we did do the x percent growth per year, it'd take a year to implement with the wait period, so like beginning of 2019 would be when it started (and it wouldn't be all 17 percent on day one, it'd happen either at the end of the period, or most likely the average of 3 months worth of blocks would get a 1/4 of the increase), or something similiar. So, between now and then, we'd have the segwit adoption transaction increase to work with. 
So, wonderful thing would be no more arguing over blocksize/blockweight for a very long time!!!

So, really it wouldn't mean much in terms of my actions, I think I probably will sell a few coins at 10K though.
As in instead of someone thinking I have a 100K for example, a better way, IMO, is to think I have the first 10K for each of the next 10 years. Doesn't sound as good, which is good, as people tend to get all stupid when they feel a wad of cash in their pocket.

Well, that'd also apply to the blockweight portion. As in the total storable "data" for a block right now is 4MB, if used in the most optimal way, Segwit, almost doubles the transactions that can fit in the "old" 1 Megabyte space you are referring to by moving some of the data to the witness portion of the 4mb block (requires a large percent of addresses to convert, like 7% of transactions are using segwit addresses now, and that percent will grow, and that'll free more space for more transaction capacity).
So, to compare presegwit blocks to future segwit blocks when more address are converted to take advantage, you'd need to multiply your figures by like 1.5-1.7 most likely. 
I didn't do the math for 2027. But 17 percent growth is a phenomenal growth rate actually. Plus there are other possible methods of increases transactions by using less space like schnorr signatures, or so I've read, I'm no expert on that though. 
Overall, taking into account possible other "optimizations" likely 8MB blocks as compared to presegwit blocks.

We could if we wanted simply, lock a particular chain at a checkpoint(1 time fix), or really, if that happened, algo change would be necessary. 
China doesn't actually "use" bitcoin anyway, it's all a speculative investment over there, if China disappeared from bitcoin entirely it'd actually be a wonderful thing on a medium long term horizon. They aren't supposed to trade bitcoin for yuan, or use it to buy things with, it's totally useless in China (if you want to remain legal) because of their communist goobermint. So, no real bitcoin growth comes from china, they are just leeching mining revenue and dumping for dollars, or speculating on price increase. 
I really wish china would ban it or make it legal for normal everyday use, but they won't allow it to compete with their currency at all, because China's government is weak, and fears any real competition. My hope for the Chinese people is they have a revolution and discard their tyrannical government that will mow students down with tanks.

It didn't have a value until it actually came into existance. Pretrading, imo, is not a valid method to determine price, as it's extremely highly manipulatible, as only a tiny fraction of the user base is aware or interested in pretrading a shitcoin they never wanted.
Anyway, if that is the way the IRS is going to treat this, I'm done. As in out forever, as I'll tell you exactly what will happen, dozens of these shit forks will happen next year.

If an ETF will get more people involved in Bitcoin even if indirectly then it's good in my opinion. Imagine 5 years from now and a couple million people have a stake in the Bitcoin ETF. Well, that just means if the heavy hand of the government starts to move, it'll piss off a couple more million people than it would otherwise. 
The only way bitcoin survives and thrives in the long term is by having the maximum number of people having a stake in its existence. 
The government doesn't care if they piss off a million people, they do care a lot when they piss off 10+ million people. There is a tipping point when enough people have or use something to where all the claims of "drug dealers" and "child porn" and "tax evasion" don't work anymore, and that is when you know someone or are part of the group in question and you're not in it for those things.

This point of view is going to be less and less "truish". I mean we have tapped almost nothing of even the power supplied by the sun on earth. Solar panel prices are already ridiculously low and still falling, the other portions of Solar installation are falling albeit slower. 10 years from now, it'll likely be more likely than not that a new house has solar panels. Then it's kinda a homeowners option how they select to use the power that a decade ago was only used to heat the roof, as that is still what 1000's of gigawatts of solar energy hitting roofs do worldwide currently. We don't have a long term energy problem anymore, battery prices are also predicted to be far cheaper by then even without a "Chemistry" breakthrough, just from economies of scale pushing the price down. 
Sure it'll take a few decades until we nearly completely transition, but the path is fairly well understood economically. Solar plus battery is already cheaper on islands, and in the highest electricity cost areas, every year solar cost falls, and some new area becomes a rational area to install mass solar, which then creates even greater economies of scale.

You aren't slicing off a slice of your gold bar. You are receiving a competing product at 0 cost on the date of the fork. After that if some value flows from btc to the new product then that is what happens. The two are not the same product being split, the new product merely copies most of the old product and decided to distribute the coins in a way that would allow it to get potential interested users. 
It can't be any other way, otherwise, all of us will be responsible for tracking every fork of bitcoin that happens any where on the planet, and applying a fraction share of present btc value to that new product without any real rational method of determining the initial value as all the pretrading of coins that are supposed to launch at some point is a very very small group compared to the user base effected. Bitcoin Cash for example was and still is trading at a false price, as many BTC holders still don't have access to there Bitcoin CAsh coins, those aren't reflected even now in the price. How can one be taxed like that, it's absurd, and to me would be the equivalent of a ban on bitcoin.

Anarchist communists argue that there is no valid way of measuring the value of any one person's economic contributions because all wealth is a collective product of current and preceding generations.[90] For instance, one could not measure the value of a factory worker's daily production without taking into account how transportation, food, water, shelter, relaxation, machine efficiency, emotional mood etc. contributed to their production. To truly give numerical economic value to anything, an overwhelming amount of externalities and contributing factors would need to be taken into account – especially current or past labor contributing to the ability to utilize future labor. As Kropotkin put it: "No distinction can be drawn between the work of each man. Measuring the work by its results leads us to absurdity; dividing and measuring them by hours spent on the work also leads us to absurdity. One thing remains: put the needs above the works, and first of all recognize the right to live, and later on, to the comforts of life, for all those who take their share in production.."[91]
IF you can't see how that system will break down nearly instantly I don't know what to say. No one would ever select to toil in the sewer, unless they were paid a much larger slice of the pie than a person that walks dogs. Lumberjacks only do it for the larger pay than they could get otherwise, no sane person would do such a dangerous job without outsized compensation comparative to other work they were qualified to do. So, you'll have a thousand guitar players,rappers, poets, and 0 fast food workers, sewer workers, roofers. 
Anarcho-communist or even regular ole communism might finally work well, after we get intelligent robots to do the drudgery, but then it doesnt' matter if it's communism, or capitalism, life will be very easy once you can buy a robot capable of building a house, and raising a garden for you, or that can diagnose your health for you.

I even clicked the mine button in 2010... but stopped mining.... like a big gigantic loser retard!!!! I never successfully mined a block, probably only mined for like an hour, but I had 10 computer servers, I could have mined hundreds or 1000's of bitcoin even..... I was this . close!!!!! FML.!!
Oh well, I did get back in, in 2013 and purchased and mined most of my coins 2013-2016, so... I'm not a complete idiot, I guess. but I could have been filthy f'n rich, if I just let it run for a few months!!!... arghhh. it hurts.

They could "partially" do it, by integrating with like coinbase. In that way it'd function just like a credit card for the buyer. For those that don't have an approved "third party btc provider", then they could simply require a deposit, in btc at like 20.00 bucks / dvd you could rent. Then they'd just hold that until you decided to cash out. The second option isn't the greatest, but for most that'd work, I generally only rent one movie anyway. But of course you'd get that BTC back eventually if you chose so not that big a deal. I had to put a deposit at the electric company before, and they gave it back after a year. 
For better or worse, it seems for some situations BTC will benefit from a third party holding and verifying funds availability. Fortunately most of those situations would pertain to small purchase items. 
That's work for me I have BTC at coinbase, and in my own wallet. 
I do think that is how this is going to play out in the long run as in coinbase type places, will hold a portion of your btc. And they'll integrate with like redbox, mcdonalds, or larger "credit processors" that serve many retailers, and for small purchases they'll run against your coinbase account. So, your primary "btc account" can be on your computer, then you just send a couple btc to coinbase (or equivalent service), and use that for day to day purchases. 
Not perfectly decentralized, but still far more decentralized than present day, in that the bulk of your btc is not held by a central authority, and you wouldn't have to use those coinbase like sites if you didn't want to for larger purchases or online purchases. 
So, things like your cable, electric, water bill, car insurance, car payments, mortgage, airline tickets, etc... you'd pay from your btc wallet directly. Things like starbucks, mcdonalds, redbox, gas station, would be coinbase "transactions". 
IMO.

This subs obsession with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett is pathetic. Bill Gates was a piece of shit, he tried to destroy the internet by controlling the browser via his control of windows. Fuck him til the end of time. He can dump all his billions into buying back his soul but he'll always be the 90's bill gates to me, and honestly that was the last decade Microsoft did anything relevant. He didn't really innovate, he stole and repackaged, and bribed his way to billions.
Warren Buffett used to room with Methuselah, his world view is based on Model T's and Peanut Brittle. He missed every tech disruption. His model is get a bunch of people to give him money, then invest it in companies that are boring as dog shit and undervalued. It's a good method, but it has no value when evaluating anything disruptive in nature. It's good for underwear, poison water, trains , mobile homes, etc...

From What I just looked up Buffett didn't invest in Apple until 2016, that's well after Apple stopped innovating and being disruptive, the last disruptive product Apple launched was the iphone, it's not an innovative company anymore it's a brand name being milked. In other words a boring company that only protects it's niche but doesn't really do anything else, that ended when Steve Jobs died. Anyway, I still stand by the fact Buffett doesn't invest in anything disruptive. He invests in things that are largely predictable. I'm not bashing Buffett but pointing out nothing disruptive will ever be in his portfolio or area of expertise, it's not his method.
As far as Bill goes nope he's a piece of shit, you are probably to young to remember his attempt to integrate the web browser into windows and make it a pain to remove it, that was a calculated effort to globally control the software required to access the internet. In effect he tried to place microsoft as the gatekeeper to the internet. that qualifies for the forever a piece of shit list.

Doesn't matter Bill Gates attempted to destroy the internet as we know it for greed. I don't care at all how he feeds his ego now. Maybe he found christ or something, I doubt it though. The fact is he did what he did in the 90's. I find it amazing people have such short memories.

Well, the "ideal" block fill rate in my humble opinion, is one where transactions are backlogged during peak demand, however, the back log is not so big that it can't be flushed during "slow" times. 
That is the "ideal" as it would provide fees, and also allow free transactions with a long wait time if so inclined. How you do that is of course the complicated bit, but it'd entail frequent blocksize shifts probably daily or more frequently.

970 will mine .005ish BTC a day right now on nicehash, and has been for months.  So, it'd take him, if purchased a good deal.  there is a refurb 970 for 259. The 970 is a better "Value" for mining than the 980.  
So, it'd take like 225ish days to fully recoup his costs on a 970 the 980 which they sell a refurb for like 370, would take around 300ish days. You don't gain much going to the 980 in terms of  mining performance.  
Granted price could dip, that's a risk.

Dogs are the first animal we domesticated, dogs have been with us as hunting partners, protectors, companions since before civilization as we know it or farming even.  It's very possible that without the humble dog, we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are today. Some evidence suggests the dog has been with us for 36000 years, meaning during the last ice age (when humans nearly went extinct). We've been with the dog, since before agriculture.  
We bred the dog to be loyal, trusting of us, to sacrifice itself to defend us. Cows don't do that, cats don't do that, pigs don't do that, chickens don't do that. Even if one can point to an anomalous case, fact is dogs are bred to devote themselves to their human master. 
Eating something like that is gross. It just is. How can you eat something that would die to protect you. 
Nope, there is a difference between a cow and dog. Not even in the same league. A cow would sit there eating grass while you get stabbed to death.  
In other words dogs have been man's best friend since we were hunters and gathers.  
The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago,[8] with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.[9] These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists.[2][6] The dog was the first domesticated species.[7][10][11][12]
Disagree all you want eating a dog is like eating a loyal ally. IT's gross and indicative a culture that doesn't value anything. I'd never go to a country that eats dogs, it's barbaric, and I'd say that to their face to. Gross, uncivilized, barbaric, backward behavior.

If you increase the users in proportion to the increase in blocksize and therefore increase transactions, something happens.... Guess what that is.................................................
Okay, I'll tell you, as a system becomes used by more people, what happens is more people work to find solutions to the problems that system might have, try to make it better. 
So, you are essentially saying there is no value in increasing the potential userbase by 2,4,8 fold and the corresponding interest, investing, research, etc... that would bring. 
I presume then the solution is to simply trash all that potential in the short term and wait for the handful of current devs to come up with the solution, test it, and possibly implement it in a couple years. 
You know, even lightning will require more space than bitcoin at present can provide if Bitcoin becomes a non-niche "thing" that more than .000001% of the world uses. So, if lightning allowed 100 transactions before your bitcoin settled back to the bitcoin blockchain we'd still need 100's of MB blocks eventually. (If got very very popular). 
So, 1MBers are speaking from the perspective of poverty and failure. Any success scenario will require larger blocks. If lightning is successful=Bigger Blocks. If lightning fails and bitcoin grows still need bigger blocks. 
Also we need far more transactions/second to support the mining reward as it diminishes to avoid a situation to where you have to pay a 5.00 fee to transfer your "digital gold". Personally, IMO, if bitcoin fees are higher than cc fees that is failure.

She's wrong about women not being biologically tilted towards government. As soon as women got the right to vote in every state, then nationwide, government spending went up. This is not a random event, different states gave women the right to vote at different times. 
Of course this isn't to say women can't be anarchists or libertarians, obviously they can, but they will always be the minority, they always have, and history shows they always as a "group" use the state to extract benefits for themselves.

I'm fairly sure this is NOT an end user device. This device appears to be solely for the purpose of prototyping integration with other devices, and allow people to work out the ends and outs of the process.

Nvidia is simpler to mine with. AMD you have to mess with so many settings to get things right. 
You wouldn't mine Bitcoin directly with either of those cards, you'd mine an alt coin or use nicehash to "rent" out your hash for btc. 
If you aren't paying for electricity, it's worth it you'll eventually earn the cards value back. 
The 980 will blow the shit out of the 7950. I got some 7950's off ebay for like 120 bucks last winter. The 980 is way way more expensive, but will be more efficient per watt.

Download isn't the problem. I have a 100 Mb/s download. Problem is 4 mb/s upload. 
I fully expect that upload to go up in the next year or so. 
So, yeah I could fully keep my wallet synced with 8 or 16 MB blocks, I'd be kinda useless on the upload side at 16 MB's, and treading water at 8. The reason being you need to propagate the blocks fast, not necessarily in 10 minutes to be useful to the network.  
I really don't think we "need" 8 MB blocks right now, but we do need a non-biased method of increasing the blocksize when necessary.

The only rational approach by the IRS would be to assign the new coins a cost basis of 0, and an acquisition date as being the date of the fork, otherwise, you essentially just killed legal bitcoin use. As the tax implications and complications would be unduly burdensome if not impossible to comply with in some situations. 
The reasoning is, any person on the planet can create fork off bitcoin at anytime, without the consent of the userbase, or developers of bitcoin. It is blatantly and obviously different than a company that voluntarily splits it's stock using a mechanism set in place consentually by the vested parties. As in Bitcoin Gold for example, is merely a few dudes that decided to make a fork, 99% of the community had no vote or representation in regards to the fork. It's essentially a completely different product, that merely copies part of bitcoin for coin allocation. There is no value to those coins before they are created, and the value actually tested in the marketplace to determine such. An exchange allowing false trading before the software even ships doesn't qualify as a method to determine actual price in reality. The Software may never ship for example or be unusable in practical application, how can you allow a price to be determined for something that doesn't exist currently in any form, and may never exist in reality ever. Also the pool of people interested in pretrading a possible fork coin is miniscule compared to the userbase that will be affecting. 
IF the IRS does treat any fork as a convoluted involuntary "stock split" without holder represenatiion (assigns partial value of the cost basis, and uses the btc acquistions date) where the userbase had no representation in any form concerning the new forked coin, then tax compliance would possibly be practically impossible. So, for example let's say I fork bitcoin and apply replay protection etc... and call it bitcoin MEga!, and don't give 2 shits about telling anyone I did it, just posted a single post on bitcointalk about it and that's it, and I get it listed on an obscure exchange in Thailand, and for shits and giggles, and set the first buy order to a 1000.00 USD for one Bitcoin Mega Coin. My buddy sells me his bitcoinMEga coin for a 1000.00 USD. PRICE Discovered, everyone now owes (1000.00USD*# of Bitcoinmega * tax rate).  
So, if forked coins are assigned any value other than 0 as the cost basis, then the IRS would essentially have banned all legal bitcoin use in the US, because compliance would be an absurdly hellish nightmare.

Looks like a piece of shit company "Allied Wallet" has paid for his view on the subject.
On March 14, 2018, Sherman made highly critical remarks about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and Initial Coin Offerings. He started his prepared remarks by saying "Cryptocurrencies are a crock". He further said, on Congressional record, that all Bitcoin does is allow "a few dozen men in my district to sit in their pyjamas on their couch all day, and tell their wives they are going to be millionaires". He further suggested that Bitcoin doesn't provide any value to the real economy, asking "when you buy a Bitcoin, are you helping build a new factory?"[87] One of Sherman's top campaign contributors in 2017-2018 was online payment processor Allied Wallet, a provider of e-commerce merchant services and online payment processing services.[88]

I imagine if bitcoin ever really took off. Eventually, you could have something like a read only Bitcoin chip with the whole blockchain up to x block plopped on the motherboard. Then only block after x block would be written to the hard drive.

They may attempt to treat it as a currency, and if lucky might give it special treatment as a "native" currency or however you want to describe a currency that you don't have to pay gains upon if it appreciates in value. As in the US if the dollar gains "value" you don't pay taxes because of that. However if you held a foreign currency and "cashed" out you'd be hit for profits relative to the dollar value you purchased at. It'd be interesting if you had two "native" currency by law.

Most want bitcoin to grow as much as possible in a rational manner. So, we can handle 2MB blocks! Great we agree that 2MB is a rational level, we do that, and see how well that goes, and what the effect of the add-ons do to the transaction volume. A year later we should know if we can handle 3 MB blocks. If not, well, it was fun, but the tech isn't there, if so, great 3MB blocks, and more room.

I looked up how to manually decode a qr code, you should be able to with some graph paper, and hours of time, decode most of the qr code one character at a time, which would give you the beginning and end of the private key. Then the missing few digits in the middle area of the qr code would be small enough that they actually could be cycled through. 
I'd do it, but that's a lot of work!! The QR code spec is on wikipedia. To be honest if I did it, I'd keep the whole amount, and still be underpaid for doing all that work. 
The qr code encodes each character in like a block of 8 of those qr squares, so you can get the characters all around the damaged area. which just eyeballing it looks like you'd be missing like 8ish characters in the middle, but then even looking at the printed private key you can also reduce the possible values for those characters simply by the size of the smugged characters, like you can tell a small smudge character is not a W, or a V, etc...
So, yeah, it's possible, and really it could take a few hours likely if had a program made for the task. Making a program would take days, or weeks of time.

A bump to 2 MB would satisfy the vast majority of "big blockers" with segwit as well, not as a replacement for 2mb. I've only seen a couple people that are notorious for hyper paranoia claim that 2MB blocks would be harmful. 
This whole situation could be resolved by simply giving a thresh hold point when the block size would be increased. Such as saying if x number of blocks average y percentage of transaction capacity then we'll schedule a bump to 2MB in the next full release cycle. 
Simple enough. 
Don't even go and claim a 2MB block will "Cost" so much to the nodes and they'll drop off, that's simply garbage talk. I have like a 3-4 year old computer that can run the scary 2MB just fine, and my not superduper internet connection has enough upload to spare. I'm pretty well on the lower end of the average in regards to upload speed and computer power on the rig run my node. 5mb upload.  100 mb download, but download doesn't matter as much in regards to a node. 
Anyway, this situation is wholly resolvable, but no one wants to be reasonable.

Yeah, I think that is the solution as well. It wouldn't be difficult at all to set up an autopay function, that allows you to set pay requests from approved vendors for approved amounts restricted by a time between payments. Any change in price, or outside bounds request would simply require reapproval of the new parameters. 
So, you'd need a frequency restraint, An amount constraint, and a field set to active or inactive for a service. 3 box form, and even that information can be autopopulated by clicking a subscribe button that will registered your local client to poll the netflix billing server daily.

Who would declare it "illegal". Why would it be illegal? It's a "Commodity", is this commodity a danger to human life? Is a ledger on computers to be illegal? Is encryption to be illegal? Is trading a digital asset for a product to be illegal. 
Law must be rational and defined, or it's simple thuggery. 
I think that would go to the supreme court and we'd win. 
What is illegal about it? Define it. And let's make all things with the component parts illegal as well then. It would make no sense to say a decentralized ledger is illegal, but a centralized ledger is legal. 
Edited to add. Essentially banning bitcoin, would expose the government to have absolutely no respect for a rational system of laws, rendering it in effect a mob of gangsters for anyone wishing to think but a moment about the situation. So, in that regard it would have served its purpose. 
They may ban it, maybe I have more respect for rational law than the supreme court, however at that point my last bit of respect for the government will be gone as well.

Ah, I see, the whole point of this is to totally and forever completely make 0 confirmation transaction unacceptable to everyone. So, Instead of 0 confirm being viewed as good enough for some, those people will never accept 0 confirm again. So, it effectively kills all present retail acceptance of bitcoin. 
In comes the Solution, lightning will rush in to fill that now trashed miniscule market of brave real world retailers taking bitcoin.

If bitcoin soars to like a 100K a coin, I'd likely have a 1/3 the bitcoin I have now. Having sold some at like 25K 50K 75K. Regardless I'd still be a multi-millionaire in fiat and bitcoin. 
So, what would the situation be, well, I live in a smallish town in US, to my knowledge there has never been an adult kidnapping for money here, since I've been alive which is over 40 years. There are known multimillionaires living around here already, and they drive nice cars, live in nice houses with a pool and tennis court. 
So, okay.. 1 I'm not to worried about it. 2. I would have several dogs at home, and a security system. 3. I would have firearms. 4. Most of my wealth Fiat and Bitcoin would not be readily available if it was worth that much. So, a person could not simply rob me for it. I assume if bitcoin were worth a 100K + easy solutions for that would come about. 5. I'd simply tell people I sold most of it and that is how I have my house and I invested the rest in bonds and stocks.

Here's some of the socialist to socialist "light" points from Hitlers 25 point plan. 
All citizens must have equal rights and obligations.
The first obligation of every citizen must be to productively work mentally or physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all.
Consequently, we demand:
Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.
In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore, we demand the total confiscation of all war profits.
We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).
We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries.
We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.
We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.
We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land.
We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.
We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order.
The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the State must be striven for by the school [Staatsbürgerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the State of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.
The State is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.

What it appears to do, is turn accepting 0 confirm transactions from risky to suicidal. People did monitor the network, for double spend attempts and could reduce the risk, now that doesn't much matter at all.  Now, that every single 0 confirm transaction can be replaced with very high probability as in near 100%. Absolutely no physcial retailer should accept bitcoin anywhere on planet earth. Also no one should sell downloadable digital assets for bitcoin either unless coupled with a revocable DRM scheme. 1 confirm can take over an hour, no place for retail in that scenario. So when all this happens bitcoin is real world retail dead.
Also there are no methods at present to facilitate actual bitcoin to be used to buy in the real world, lightning isn't there, the credit cards backed by bitcoin are just nonsense, they aren't actually using bitcoin but rather supporting the banking industry just like a debit card would.

What you listed except for the drones is the government picking winners and losers nothing more. 
I was in business in 2008, I got no preferential loans backed by the government. What I got was credit lines pulled for no reason because of the mess. We never missed a payment, and it's been paid off completely since. So, okay you are cool with the merger of private business and government. I'm kinda against it, you know the whole taxation by force thing, to just hand it over to GM. Not to mention the whole crisis was because of the government and banks to begin with, why should I as a taxpayer by liable for a loan to GM or a criminal bank if they did default. It's criminal. 
Obamacare is costing me 175 more dollars / month more for shittier healtcare coverage than I had pre-obamacare. Obamacare is just welfare. If you are getting a subsidy that is because others are overpaying for their coverage. More government picking winners and losers.

I see it as an inevitability. The Powers that Be, know that cash wreaks havoc on their control over the population, it allows transactions to happen outside of their view, they don't like this for legit and illegitimate reasons. So, the long term pressure will be to remove cash, and replace it with something universally traceable and under their control.
Now, the only alternative to a system controlled by them, is a system controlled by us. The only way they can get to a cashless society using a system under their control is if they can figure out how to make such a system as desirable or more desirable to the public than cash. 
The race is between "bitcoin" like systems and Centralized systems from google, apple, etc... that are effectively government systems in that the government can with a push of a button see all your transactions, lock your account, etc.... 
While bitcoin may be only psuedo anon, that isn't really the most important part, IMO, the most important part is lack of ability to lock an account. Any system endorsed by the government will have that ability, and that ability is effectively the power to prevent anyone at will from transacting, and that that is the ultimate power.
So, it's our system or their system. This is one of the reasons I don't care much for the "digital gold" view of bitcoin, as it does nothing in the end. A "digital gold" world will not have enough places accept it natively ever, as "digital gold" by its nature is a "store of value" not a day to day transaction mechanism. So,  bitcoin would exist as an on and off ramp right back into a system that is totally controlled, there would be little point in it, and I'd even bet once we go cashless, and the public accepts the new "government" controlled system, they'd then simply ban bitcoin and it'd lose it's ability to function as "digital gold" anyway.

Yeah, but a lot of debt is non-functional. Sure getting some degrees may be a good investment worthy of debt, sure getting a car to get you to work can be justified debt as well. 
BUUUUUUTTTTTTT...... we all know a lot of people buy far more house than they can rationally and safely afford, or a nicer car than needed to get to work and back, or buy stupid crap like ipads, designer clothes or even vacations on credit. 
And dare I say it... some people go to college for stupid degrees or don't graduate.

Well, I think this current price spike is happening despite the blocksize debate, I've no doubt we'd be kissing 4000 by now if we had a scaling agreement. 
Well, now we have segwit classic activation, Bip 148, some other segwit bip, BU, the "consensus agreement", everyday there is another "solution" and each one garners support from some fraction of the user base, but a "real" solution that doesn't rip the community apart will need a large majority to get implemented. 
So, it looks like bitcoin is fracturing more and more, not getting close to a solution. 
Plus yeah, the price is up, and don't see what is holding it up either. So, I cashed out enough to cover all my bitcoin "costs" in fiat or mining. So, Essentially what is left is all "profit" more or less. I had to much in as well.

Pegasus is actually quite tasty, some red wine, and cheese to go along with it. American Pegasii are generally larger and contain more fat content than the Asian variety if you ever had that. The extra fat adds to the flavor and the meat is quite tender as American pegasii like to sit around a lot. However, when they become "active" they are quite uncontrollable and dangerous, thus the price premium for hazard pay to the supplier. 
thanks. Enjoy your lunch. Overall american pegasus is considered a delicacy every fan of exotic foods should try at least once in their life.

I didn't say they'd force their users to use bitcoin, just accept it. That probably would at this time only be measured in like a few thousand subscribers making a transaction once a month. And while I'm complaining about netflix, they should just let you pay 6 months at a time if you want, or a year. I'd prefer 1 payment a year, as opposed to 12 payments clogging up my bank statements. 
Edited to add. Some of the "Important" people in the blocksize debate have stated they don't want to increase the blocksize until we are filling up the 1MB constantly. So, in that regard for some larger blocks come after network saturation, I don't agree with that view, but at least we'd all agree larger blocks are necessary at that point I guess.

That's nothing at all to do with bitcoin, that is cabs taking credit cards or debit cards.

There is no financial industry without our consent. You see Neo, the banks only have power as long as we grant them such, with our earnings and the labor and time it took to make that money. 
What is money... Control.. A system designed to turn an otherwise free man into this. (A Battery, or power source). A source of infinite labor and time, extracted at the precise rate to keep the masses tantalizing close to possibly escaping the system but inevitably all that time and energy (labor=money), via an ingenious system of taxation fees, and penalties for mere ownership of property is siphoned back into the very system you, I and they are attempting to escape from.
You have a choice Neo, stay in the system, work, survive, take an occasional vacation to a third world nation and sit on 3 miles of beachfront property isolated from the poverty of the rest, pay into the system so it can increase its control, and monitoring of you, and then die old and ultimately ineffectual in amounting to anything but strengthening the power of a few men, or you can join us, and be taunted, ridiculed, and possibly hunted for the desire to do one thing, and that is to honestly own the fruits of your own labor. To not be a slave Neo.

I'm all for open borders, the second we get rid of all tax paid for social services, and entitlements. 
If the United States completely opened its borders tomorrow, and granted full citizenship upon request, we'd be bankrupt in a few years. When the US had it's liberal immigration policy we didn't even have an income tax, and we started clamping down as soon as we did and started implementing all the social welfare programs. There was no social security, no medicare, no medicaid, no food stamps, no section 8 housing. 
So, yeah, let's open the borders with the caveat that we remove all entitlement benefits for all, that would ensure people only are coming here that are willing to work.

I think it'd be wonderful if we had a pci-express based miner, that used like 200watts max. Some video cards take that much power, so it'd be equivalent to a GTX 1080 + a little in terms of power.  I'd guess a video card manufacturer would be best to outsource the design to, considering they have the most experience with cooling high powered cards.

Bitcoin at present isn't a threat at all right now. If it ever get up to 100's of billions that will be when they take it seriously. They might not even ban it, they may just take over the "mining" function as a state only activity, and that would probably prompt other countries to do the same, as at that point Bitcoin trade would approach economic levels that a collapse would pose a systemic risk. So, in the end, I'd guess you'll have the Central Miner of the United States, China, France, etc. They'll probably make a treaty dictating each countries maximum hashrate, in order to "preserve" the decentralized process. 
Then you have global bitcoin. 
Before someone negs me because they make it up in their own head that I'm pro that scenario occurring I'm not, just think that's a likely ultimate outcome of Bitcoin becoming widespread and global.

It might be true, I just woke up and had a dream about bitcoin, my first dream ever about bitcoin. In the dream the chart was looking normal but then it shot up and up, like a jesus candle on meth. I set a sell at 60K just in case. and it hit. IT crashed so I figured it was an anomaly, but put more sells in at 70K and it hit, then the dream got weird, I was at my now deceased mothers house and a pelican was inside the house and broke the window out from inside, and I was chasing a cat. Then I went to some other house my sister and her husband were at, it was okay house, and then it looked condemned in the back, then I went to a bedroom off the side and it looked okay and they were sleeping, and that is the last I remember. 
So, point is bitcoin 70K is real!!!

Ummm, bitcoin today is useless for nearly everyone. The only reason I own it is for the potential that it one day will be useful. Right now I can't do anything with bitcoin that doesn't cost more than using a debit card. I don't do international remittances. I buy stuff off newegg, amazon, ebay. That's my internet shopping. So bitcoin can be used at newegg. What a fucking success!!!! LEt's keep it small and useless so the government doesn't mess with it. Jesus do you people even read what you are saying. You are actually advocating keeping bitcoin useless for 99.9% of the world. What a visionary!!
Now, with segwit, lightning, and larger blocks, it may be useful SOME day, that's what I want something actually useful, not a neutered little thing for drug dealers, and illegal immigrants to send money over the border. I'd rather it just died if that's what it is to be. 
So what exactly is bitcoin for in your world? It's not a store of value for 99.9% of the world. It'll never help the kenyan farmer. It'll never help me either. Who the hell is this imaginary user you are protecting?
Here's the real difference, some think Bitcoin right now is actually benefiting the world. I don't think so, I think it could with much wider adoption. 
We need several order of magnitude increase in users to see any benefit for most people. Right now all bitcoin is good for is DRUGS and immigrants sending money over the border. I gain 0 benefit using bitcoin at newegg, I could just use my debit card, as all newegg does is dump the bitcoin for fiat anyway. LOL. Now if we had several orders of magnitude more users likely Newegg wouldn't dump all that bitcoin because someone in there business would likely take it to! YAY, so impressed,what a stupid thing to spend all this time and effort to facilitate, and it's not even good at remittances as they have to convert back and forth to fiat, because you guessed it, the user base is SO TINY almost no one takes it for anything required to live, because you need more USERS, which means BIGGGERERREREER blocks, even with segwit, and lightning, etc.. You will still need bigger blocks to get to a meaningful user base count.
Barf, this isn't your nerd science experiment, this is real world economics, and in the real world a system like this is only worth exisitng if it has lots of users, and you need even with segwit, lightning, etc.... larger blocks to get there. 
Neg me, I don't care. This shit is just to dumb anymore.
So, yeah, we can't and shouldn't even do 20 MB blocks tomorrow. But we should have space available for new users as they come 2MB for now, we need them, we need the transactions to be cheap and fast to attract them, we do need more transaction capacity if this is to be a worthwhile project, which hasn't been proven yet by the way, unless the point was to give bankers ideas on how to make their systems more efficient So, far bitcoin has had no helpful effect on the world beyond that I just mentioned.
Need more users.

Best Solution IMO, is integrate a hardfork to activate a year after segwit activates, and and that "new" code would be a simple 1.15 multiplier applied to the blocksize yearly thereafter. So, everyone would have a year to prepare, we can't do a major code update in a month, not enough time to upgrade everything.
So, year 1 we get segwit increase, 365 days later all "transaction" capacity values would be multiplied by 1.15. Repeat yearly. 
If they reject that, then well, f'em, and let's just fork this shit.

Ummm, it matters, in 2020 Bitcoin cuts the block reward in half yet again. I believe that will be 6.25 Bitcoin from 12.5 now every 10 minutes. That's a lot 6.25 * 6 per hour* 24 hours=900 bitcoins difference every day between 2020 bitcoin and today. 900 bitcoins is worth like 2 Million dollars today. So, 2 Million dollars less bitcoins potentially being sold off by miners every day with newly created coins.

The number of bitcoins don't matter at all in regards to fees, it has to do with how many inputs you use to form that transaction.

If a country were going to do that, the first step, would be to simply treat bitcoin as a competing currency with all benefits of the current national currency, as in accept it for payment of taxes, not charge taxes on gains. A country could begin to accumulate BTC balances that way. Then they simply let the market decide which way the country goes afterward. My guess in 10-20 years they'd just naturally migrate as the percentage of BTC usage grew and fiat diminished,so in the end it'd be a non-event when the old currency completely died in a few decades. At that point the government could offer a final conversion for the remain percent turned in by x date.

Scenario 1. If using First in First out method. Well. it'd be 0.75*500=Cost Basis.  Sold price=300. Sold price -Cost Basis =Capital Gain or loss. And you'd still have .25 BTC at 500 remaining for your next transaction. 
You essentially have to keep two tables, one showing your transactions and another table that rolls through your balances and dates of acquisition when you encounter a taxable event and that tracks "standing" balances and reports your Cost Basis for the current transaction. 
I made my own personal "website" here on my intranet to do it for me. I have to enter and classify every single transaction as like (purchase new btc with fiat, sold btc for fiat, personal expense, business expense, exchange btc for other crypto, received btc from sell of other crypto, etc...). But it's not so bad now as I'm up to date. 
Scenario 2: I use my website I made to do that, it's essentially the same as example one. 
Scenario 3: You valued your basedball cards at 200 as extrapolated from the btc price. So your cost basis would be 200. You sold for 500. So you had a capital gain of 300 dollars, if the time between buying the btc and selling was over a year you pay long term capital gains, if it was under you pay short term capital gains. 
Scenario 4: You were paid whatever the value in dollars for 1 BTC was on the date of the transaction as "Normal Income".  When you buy the watch for 1BTC the value of the watch would be your cash out value. So fill in the blanks. Sold-Cost=Capital gain or loss. Then if the duration was over a year you pay long term capital gains, if under you pay short term capital gain. 
The 1 million btc would have a cost basis based on the going rate on the date you mined them and that should have been reported as "normal" income during the appropriate tax year. So, if you sold all million in one go, you'd take the amount of the proceeds as sold value. and subtract your cost basis which in satoshis case would be a huge profit with long term capital gains owed on the difference.

Edited to add, I'm not really complaining about the current .40 situation. However, I'd not have made the purchase if the fee was like 4.00 that would be stupid as it'd be better just to use my debit card, 4 dollars is 4 dollars I don't generally burn money for fun.

Do it, and while you are at you need to find the main circuit panel for the place, then you need to subcontract another miner to at least one dorm room on different branch circuit as you'll probably blow the circuit if you have a huge miner and your buddies in the dorm room next to you do to, but most likely the floor above you is another untapped source of free kilowatts on a different circuit. 
Or if you are really adventurous, you could just go into the bathrooms, and install a miner in the ceiling, it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to splice the wire install an outlet up there. You'll need a cheap router and wireless adapter though to tap into the schools free wifi for each of them, that'll add another 20ish bucks to your expense per install if buy off ebay. I figure if motivated you can have 50 of these things all around campus. Just hide them a bit up there, as they change light bulbs and such and might poke there head above the false ceiling for some reason.

Well, for bitcoin to "moon" it doesn't require the majority or even a large minority. I'd say if even 5% of the people in developed nations adopted crypto we'd be well beyond 40K. 5% of 350 million in the US. is 17.5 million people, and that's just the us alone.

In that scenario there would be plenty of warning to take precautionary measures. 
1. The whole grid would get shutdown before it got here.
2. Personally, I have a metal trashcan ghetto faraday cage, all my hard drives are going in there, along with expensive electronics. 
3. I'm going to go outside my house and remove the meter entirely, and also turn all my breakers to the off position and unplug everything. They can fine me if they want. 
I believe the main danger from the suns coronal mass ejection is long distance antennas like power lines receiving the frequency. Unlike an emp which sends out all kinds of different electronic try frequencies. 
I'd guess some major damage to the grid is still likely, and lots of fires starting. I'm pretty sure though from the reading I've done that a basic faraday cage would be adequate, and possibly not even necessary, if you aren't connected to long wires like the grid.

I  can still liquidate gold easier than bitcoin. In every medium sized town in the U.S. there is a gold and silver shop. I can actually liquidate my silver in probably 30 minutes during the day, that network is of "liquidating" that particular asset is highly decentralized. 
Bitcoin, as is, in terms of cashing out and converting that "Store of value" you cherish, is far far less decentralized and highly monitored. 
The more adoption in theory the more stores, people, businesses will accept it, and therefore your options to convert to other items, or "stores of value" would be greater
I think the store of value goes right along with adoption. 
You state as businesses started accepted it the value didn't go up but down. Yeah, that's because IMO of pent up demand and excitement from users to "use it" finally. I don't perceive that will happen if we tripled stores taking it. Eventually what happens when you know you will probably use something eventually, is you just keep it in that form. I have money in Paypal, simply because I might buy something on Ebay. If bitcoin were accepted at amazon, I could easily see some users just keeping some bitcoin because they will probably eventually use it anyway. The intention isn't a store of value, but of laziness. Multiply 1000000 lazy users by a 100 bucks of "lazy" money in accounts is the effect greater adoption would have. 
Currently the vast majority of my bitcoin spending has been at newegg, even though I spend more money online at amazon.

Well, in fairness, if the google authenticator install worked it clearly tells you to write down the secret key and store it to where you can't lose it.  It's essentially like your restore words for a trezor, very very important. 
I don't blame coinbase at all for making anyone that can't login with authenticator jump hoops to get back into an account. That is the whole point of it. It gives them time to make sure you actually own the account or to at least make a potential thief trying to break into an account have to work very hard to get in.

Actually we have no options really. UASF will fail horribly, or wreck the whole bitcoin economy come August. The only non-destructive path was a simple 2MB hardfork with segwit like a year ago that could have been scheduled a year out, but nope now we are playing bitcoin roulette for no real reason at all, other than ego. 
IMO. 
edited to add. if bitcoin explodes come August that is the fault of core primarily, and secondarily to Bitmain. Core started the fight with their refusal to add a simple base block size increase, then Bitmain jumped in and showed two can play the unreasonable  game, and here we are today. UASF or bust, with a high probability of at least a temporary bust, and 50/50 chance that bitcoin will lose its status as the  crypto, and lose it's "network effect" advantage forever.

I seriously think we are in the final round of finding the bottom.

This does seem to me to be a few large whales pushing it this low, maybe they have enough coins and cash to push it lower, or they really want out forever, but they're going to run out at some point. 
I put in a bid for some more bitcoin, first time since 6000.00, it hasn't been filled yet. But... can buy so many bitcoins now for almost nothing, it's getting hard to resist. I told myself not until 2019, breaking my own rules.

Climate change debate is a bunch of nonsense. WHY??????? BEcasue NOBODY is doing anything about it, even those screaming about it the most. Go, ask Leonardo Dicaprio why he has multiple mansions, boats, flies all over the planet, owns multiple cars, etc.... and at the same time cries about climate change. OR AL GORE that lives in a HUUUUUGGGEEE house, far larger than could be sustained if we all were glutenous like the loudest voices shouting about climate change. Whether it's true or not, the fact is the only ones supposed to suffer to stop or slow it are the middle class and lower, elites are apparently excepted from doing anything at all. 
Personally, I've made my peace with it, whatever the effects of human pollution are it's going to continue, Nothing has been done of significance, it's just a virtue signaling mantra, they say it like the mere fact of acknowledging something changes it. 
Barring some radical advancements in technology that allows us to keep consuming like we do already in a more sustainable way it's a lost cause.

I started using bitcoin when nearly everyone was talking about millions and eventually billions of people using bitcoin. So, if you are against making bitcoin allow for more users, then you are in fact changing bitcoins long term goal. Why would you want bitcoin to stay like this forever anyway, it's still not even useful really, all speculation that it might be useful someday. 
I'd never purchased a single btc if I came here and everyone was saying. Oh bitcoin needs to be exclusively for rich people to send value around the world which is largely what bitcoin is today in reality, that's sooooo inspiring and needed............. not.... lol. 
So, yeah, since 2013 when I really started messing with bitcoin the goal was mass adoption and that view was shared by most at the time. IF that isn't your vision now, you are attempting to rewrite history nothing more.

I haven't seen a fact based retort to Jordan Peterson. It's always emotional, or a willful manipulation of what he actually said.  MAybe the video you linked to did do that at some point, I don't know it's 3 hours long, and the guy did not appear worth watching after a few minutes. If you link to the portions of relevance I'll watch it, not 3 hours worth.
Here's one common example I see that is thrown about.
Example: Jordan Peterson says, makeup is used by women to enhance sexual characteristics, and states maybe we need to talk about the impact of that in the workplace.
Duffus Heads retort: Jordan Peterson wants to ban makeup and says women are asking to be sexually harassed at work.
He didn't say either, but if you attempt to have any conversation they stick to their false assertions.
If anyone wants to provide a rational fact based refutation of anything he says I'll watch it. (Not 3 hours for 10 minutes of relevant content)
I didn't agree with his stance on the Supreme Court hearings at all, so I don't blindly accept his views on things either, but the opposition I've witnessed to most of his views is lacking.

That's because there are so few people using it the political backlash is inconsequential. You are stating what happens when the adoption is sub 1 percent.  But they very well may just ban it, if a financial crisis happens, there is no negative for them to banning it at present.
All they have to do right now is call CNN, MSNBC, FOX and have them start running stories about bitcoin involving sex, slavery, murder. The public wouldn't flinch if the government wanted to ban something viewed as evil, that they don't own or understand, which are pretty well the same group. It's much much more difficult to vilify a group if one included in that group is your son, daughter, etc.

Because of Goobermint. 
See there was an event called 911. The objective of 911 was to strike fear into the hearts of americans, cause them  to degrade our freedoms, and get entangled in an expensive never ending war on "terror". Idiots promptly complied and now we have Orwellian bank monitoring, and literally trashed trillions fighting useless wars, and to boot, now we have nearly 100% open Southern border that any terrorist can walk right in at their leisure (so, obviously they aren't really worried about protect the US against terrorists), but they did succeed, in making life more of a pain for good honest citizens with the useless KYC laws and TSA, and really that was the point from the beginning 911 was simply a convenient excuse to clamp down on US citizens. 
It's called an authoritarian government. We have that here in the US now, most people don't seem to care much though, and it just gets worse with time, next will be China style internet monitoring, all the big tech companies are on board for that, they implement it for the Chinese government already!

I support conservation in general. It's quite the coincidence, but just yesterday I purchased some motion detection light sockets for the indoors, because I have a tendency to leave the hall light on even though I don't need it on all the time, So, figured why not, save a few watts, have to change light bulb less often etc... I have a small solar setup now, that runs my DC capable fridge, I just bought that recently. I let the temperature get into the 50's if necessary in the winter, I only use air conditioning in my bedroom in the summer, as I can not sleep if it's to hot. 
Sure, I support effort to reduce consumption, I already do more than anyone I know, but that doesn't mean it's going to change anything, I do it more because I like "efficiency", and don't like waste. I also Still mine, so you wouldn't know it by my power bill, but that's not "waste" as far as I'm concerned, it's serving a purpose. 
I like that kind of thing, but fact is most people don't and by most I mean, besides talking about it I don't know anyone in real life doing anything at all about over consumption of resources and energy, especially not the blowhard celebrities and politicians that consume more resources than nearly anyone.  
People still go on "Cruises" people still fly half way around the world for a 5 day vacation, people still cool there houses to 70 degrees in the summer. We in the US still waste TONS of Food, etc... Nothing at all has changed in the day to day habits of most people, and they've been talking about global warming for more than 10 years already. Nothing is going to change until something catastrophic happens, that's how humans roll. 
I mean it's like everything else, for example,  I saw a documentary on the levees around New Orleans being insufficient BEFORE hurricane Katrina happened, they knew eventually there would be a storm that wiped out a city, and only did the minimum to keep things going during regular year to year storm patterns, but then wham... Katrina hits and everyone acts like it's is a tragedy. It wasn't it was a fully known and avoidable disaster. I watched another documentary after Katrina years later and they said that the levees and pumps were still inadequate. So... people won't even save themselves from that..

I made a glorified excel sheet in the form of a webpage with mysql for mine. I use First In First Out accounting. And I have ever single trade I've ever done back to my little free faucet bitcoin in 2010. (I didn't really get into bitcoin back then unfortunately but still use the same wallet with all the history). 
For external transactions I manually copy them from site I'm using and input into my database, for the bitcoin wallet I export the CSV file and import into mysql. I categorize ever transaction by type. Like Transfer between wallets (no tax), Transfer to Exchange(not tax event), Sold for fiat (tax event), Personal Purchase(tax event) etc.... Then my little webpage will cycle through and tell me the value I purchased the coins at and I input the value I sold at. I use Coinbase  price as the "fair market value" to within a few minutes, when I receive btc from mining for example. 
YEah, it's a clusterfuck of epic proportions, that's why I don't actively day trade. I only acquire BTC, use btc to buy some stuff, or sell btc for fiat. No day trading, If I do at some point in the future buy an alt coin, well it'll be a large chunk at one time, so only one event to keep track of. 
This issue is definitely in the top 3 issues bitcoin has imo. Alot of people are going rogue,but yet trading on tracked websites. F that, I wouldn't do well, in Federal fuck you in the ass prison. Yep, I'm a coward in that regard, call me when a actually revolution happens and I'll screw my nuts back on then.

Well, I just got a homing beacon activated, so 06/22/2017 is the furthest back you'll be able to go in theory, but you didn't show up yet, so... later than today in reality. This eliminates the need to be at the actual coordinates you time shift to. It's complicated, but all time travel breaks down to is have a information connection and a suitable host to insert that information into. 
We just received the instructions to build a neural net capable of holding a human mind from the future, apparently they were waiting for us to build it, and obviously knew when we'd be able to receive data, it's crazy advanced stuff, and even with all the data and instructions, it'll take us years to piece this all together, not to mention somehow scrape together a few million for the chip run. 
Anyway, in reality it'll probably be 2019-2020 before we get this brain box working and tested, and then we have to attach that to a robot body of some sort so the visitor can be mobile. 
It's not as easy to time travel as you'd think.

That has little to do with 1 MB blocks. You can't seriously think we'd have more nodes if we had 1/2 MB blocks. lol, already Bitcoin is unsuitable for sub 50 dollar transactions because of fees, rendering it useless for all of the third world , imagine what they'd be if we had half the capacity, likely either the price would dive, or we'd have 300 dollar transaction minimum because of the 30.00 transaction fees. Anyway, there is no point for a poor person to use bitcoin at all anymore, and therefore no reason for them to run a node. So, your sub 1MB would cost nodes as well. Anyone using bitcoin now is effectively "rich"  by world standards and surely can afford  a 100 dollar laptop and broadband internet. 
edited to add. misread your post so next little paragraph doesn't apply, read your post originally incorrectly. 
Centralization also has nothing to do with 1MB blocks, that's because of the electricity costs, and there are only a few miner manufacturers. I don't mine bitcoin directly because it's not worth it economically, not because blocks are to big. 
Relay networks is the only thing you mentioned at all that is even remotely applicable. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:14:30
I'm no expert but each receive is to my understanding 1, old fragmentations  get destroyed when someone sends a multiple input transaction to you, so I think it'd be 1 per received transaction in your wallet. So, I think you just add up all the transactions sent to you. 
Well, and then when you make an out going transaction your change would create another. So.... that's more.

Hashrates vary depending on what you are mining, hashrates range for like 100's a second to Billions. Most likely you'll be mining zcash, or ethereum, and you'd get a 580, or 480, though most are outta stock because of the current alt mania.

Advice: if you have a dirty wallet full of small inputs, now would be a good time to consolidate them. Just send your whole wallet balance to a new address at one time, and now you have a clean non fragmented wallet! and transactions from it won't be crazy expensive if/when fees rise again.

I'm 99.9% sure this doesn't apply to current bitcoin mining at all. From what I read elsewhere, these are essentially stripped down variants of current cards, and therefore would mine the same algos the present cards do, as in everything that doesn't have an asic. 
I've mixed feelings on it, the good thing about using a standard GPU to mine is you can sell it easily later, or well use it for it's orginal purpose, these new stripped down versions likely will be more efficient and cheaper but won't be used for any display output.

Q-7: What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of
virtual currency?
A-7: The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual
currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A taxpayer generally realizes
capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in
the hands of the taxpayer. For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property
are generally capital assets. A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the
sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the
taxpayer. Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or 
business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. See Publication 544 for
more information about capital assets and the character of gain or loss.

I have a small solar setup now. It's not grid tied, it's just battery, however, I don't want a huge battery bank just to run a miner. So, what I did was buy a voltage monitor with integrated relay, when the voltage of the system goes passed like 27.3 volts, it will kick the relay on and turn it off at like 27 volts. The relay is then connect to a DPDT(double pole double throw, so can switch both the positive and ground together)  contactor (Better relay more or less), that switches the power from the mains power to the inverters power when it receives a 24 voltish signal from the voltage monitoring relay. It's seamless, no interruption and happens automatically. 
I only have it connected to do that for one computer I'm mining ethereum with at present which is like 350 watts (shouldn't make a difference really what you power other than the wattage), and it generally powers it for a couple hours a day, but the solar system is also powering 4 16 inch 24 volt cooling fans, that circulate air throughout the house, and those use like 120 watts when they are all running, but those also have a relay that is controlled by a thermometer and auto turn off and on at set room temperatures. 
Anyway, If you have a fixed amount of power you use all the time, you don't really need to be grid tied, as long as you have a battery that can supply the power for short durations to facilitate switching back and forth to mains (Takes milliseconds with a voltage monitor). 
You still need batteries though, but I don't see that as bad, as I can still run my refrigerator if the power went down. 
Also, I'm on variable hour to hour pricing, which I'm not sure they offer if you are grid tied. Anyway, the price is conveniently highest typically when the sun is shining, so I'm cutting out the more expensive electricity hours as well. Night prices are cheaper. 
Also the batteries I have are lifepo4 batteries, which according to everything I've read, actually prefer not to be fully charged and are very accommodating to partial charge and discharge. So, I'm not fully charging the battery I prefer not to as pushing lifepo4 to their full voltage actually reduces lifespan. 3.2 volts is the lower bound and 3.6 is the upper bound but they gain voltage rapidly at the end so I try to avoid that thus the 27.ish ranges. 
I do plan to increase the wattage of the panels, as the system can handle it, probably will eventually be running one system most of the sunny day off solar, and periodically kicking back and forth to mains on a second computer. Beyond that would likely need to add another inverter and more battery.

The only way that makes sense is when/if their wholly controlled currency collapses. IT would make 0 sense to strengthen bitcoin to compete with something you have total control over. 
US Government could print as many dollars as they wish, why would they buy bitcoin with that, when that would just drive prices up, and they could just buy what they want with dollars anyway.
