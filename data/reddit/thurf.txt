Totally agree. If you believed in the strength of Cryptocurrencies when you invested, get a backbone and stick to your guns.

Coinbase systems are crashing lol.

It's funny, last week  people were talking about it eventually hitting the hundreds of thousands, or even millions. All of a sudden people are worried about it completely collapsing. Get a job, work hard &amp; smart for your money. Diversify your investments. Gold, silver, Crypto are way forward against fiat currency crash imminent.

Am I reading GDAX correctly right now? Lots of buys ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:57

Hadn't heard of exahash. Still learning. Googled it. So this is relevant to the speed at which bitcoins can be mined? What's the relevance to scarcity here? Do you mean that the speed at which we would reach all bitcoins mined is faster than other coins, and therefore the sprint upwards in price will be steepest?

Thanks taking a look now.

Ok, that will take a few reads to sink in. Is everyone investing across the board when it comes to coins, and not just bitcoins. Seems that this value is based on just on digital scarcity, and maybe that's kinda useful for holding value but only if we socially agree that a bitcoin as opposed to another coin is the one?

Why do people think it's going to $100k? Just wondering if there's any proper reason, or if it's just being hopeful :-)
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:35:43
Yup lol :-)

So, 3m left, and 2k being produced each day currently (just a quick google might be wrong)
What about the percentage of bitcoins that are just lost or mislaid that I've read about? Bitcoin auto-inheritance upon death will be a thing soon I guess :-) If a large percentage are taken out of circulation for these sorts of reasons, then the numbers would change ....
As for the halvening... that sounds like diminishing returns, and would depend only on the value going up to offset the return from mining. 
Just thinking aloud, thanks for the links guys I will absorb them more a few times today
