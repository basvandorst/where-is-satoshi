That's the point. We know the political implications are there, but we should purposely ignore them so that they don't become the main agenda for Bitcoin. 
If people keep shouting about the anarcho-capitalist (or other political) implications of the technology, politicians are only going to try harder to stunt its growth rather than implement it into society.
If we instead focus on the financial and technological benefits - stuff that the regulators can get behind - then we are masking an inevitable revolution.

Ok I see the starter plan now. Bitpay really hide that thing on their pricing page.

Thumbs up to the creator of these for compacting our bitcoin news into easy to digest bitesizes!
PM if you need any help designing these in the future.

If these regulations go through (ridiculous yes, but I've lived long enough in this world to know it wouldn't surprise me) would it be beneficial for bitcoin businesses (i.e. exchanges) to simply stop New York residents from using their services? 
This mainly applies to internet businesses who can ask for the users home city upon registration.

Will he actually see any benefits from this?
I mean if he uses Bitpay he's spending $30 a month + fees for the service of receiving and converting the rent of a single tenant. I can understand it from a retailers perspective because it can bring in custom from the bitcoin community, but I can't see many people wanting to pay rent in btc, at least not yet.

Yeah and I suppose that if you wanted to eat some fried chicken tonight, the best way would be to go out kill a chicken, and cook it. If you pay for it at KFC you're just asking to be ripped off as someone else profits as they cash out and sell you the chicken they killed! MONSTERS.

Wow, impressive. Mind if I ask roughly what your outlay was on hardware?

I've seen quite a bit of interest to merged mining, can you elaborate a little on how it works / how it will benefit mining? Cheers.
