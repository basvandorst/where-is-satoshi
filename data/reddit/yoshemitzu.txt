For some people, this is a hobby. If they're spending that little money on bitcoin instead of gaming, fancy meals, drugs, etc., then that's fine. We need not pretend everyone who doesn't allocate 100% of their finances to the "right" things is financially illiterate.
*Edit*: Before you downvote, think outside your box. The personal finance crowd often acts like people should be zombies with no personal interests until all their debts are paid and retirement is set. 
Well, frankly, most people aren't going to do that. That doesn't mean they're not aware retirement is important, it's not something they want to contribute to, or they're financially illiterate. Calling them financially illiterate is not going to make them go, "Oh, you know what? You're right. I should suspend any activities that bring me enjoyment until I can retire comfortably." Instead, they're going to say, "Screw you, calling me financially illiterate. I have a plan, and my hobbies are part of it."
This "if you aren't contributing every spare cent to your retirement, you're a moron" mentality serves no one.
And that's before I even get into the fact that some people have plans *other* than retirement...

No, like it describes in the third sentence, a CEO performing stock buybacks is still considered (and called) insider trading, even though it's totally legal.
Did you even read the page? Nowhere does it say this type of activity is "just trading" or isn't real "insider trading." The first sentence *does* say that most people associate insider trading with illegal conduct, but if you read past that sentence, you can see the point of why I linked it.
*Edit*: To simplify, just in case you really don't want to read it, whether any particular incidence of insider trading is legal or illegal depends not on the trading activity itself, but whether the trade was done by an agent with the knowledge of material, non-public information about the trading instrument that would be of significance to shareholders.

[That's not true at all. Even in the US, some forms of insider trading are totally legal](

It may not be the cap, but buying into the market at ATH is never a good idea.
*Edit*: Well, that's too broad. Going full-on HODL strategy when you bought in at ATH seems like asking for trouble, though.

You got it right. I think some people have backcronymed it to "Hold On (for) Dear Life," but I wasn't around when it started. I assume it started as a typo.

Seriously. I emailed CoinBase support about something last week and I'm still waiting to hear back, but there's a guy responding here to a post made 3 hours ago?
I get that some people think CoinBase is the bee's knees, but I've had virtually nothing but problems with them.

This is the crux of the issue. If Mtgox does this, they'll just lose the HFTs to another exchange.

No, the point of the person you're replying to is that if you're buying now at $65 and you get them later, the price *could* drop between now and then. Even though you only paid $65, they could end up worth less by the time you get them. So now you're not only poorer, you're behind the market, too. Yay.

Definitely true, though I think the general idea is that while it worked out nicely in this case (since the market has been going up lately) it wouldn't be so nice if you bought right before a crash.
