Not just for animal rights but self health as well.

Yea...also the MEGA banks is why BTC was founded in the first place.

I have my USB in one of those reusable Anti-Static bag and store it safe.

This is amazing.
The BTC fake ATM near me, you can only buy coins and you need to scan your finger prints *and possible an ID.*
There's no withdrawal and the guy who works in the store will only trash cash for btc if its 3,000k (USD) or more.
We need more of this, and people who complain about $2 fee haven't really travel outside their comfort zone

Mycelium might look dull but it's what I use and feel cozy with  (and others who posted above)
