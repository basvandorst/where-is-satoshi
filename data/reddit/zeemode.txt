You may be bitter, but you are correct. That is one of the worst written shows. Watching that show with no laugh track is the definition of hell.

No   it is not worth any of it.   Fuck the $.    It is just like the state parks in the lower 48 getting sold off for mining and oil rights. Alaska is one big state park and people here are so oil money hungry they want to drill everywhere.

1 year and 2 months ago is when I first thought that I wanted to get into BTC. I tried once to set up an account on an exchange with no luck. I kind of forgot about it and then I chose to buy New desktop and take a big vacation instead of buying about BTC. For the money I could have bought probably 6-7. I think it was trading at around $600 at the time. Now I have .5 and am scraping month to month to finish by 1 whole coin. I want to cry but then I hear of people who had 100 and sold all at $32 and never got in again. And it takes a little of the pain off. haha.   It's all good though. We are all so early. It is all relative with crypto isn't it

Thank you for the advice.  I'll leave a small amount of my LTC and ETH on there to play with and take my BTC and majority of my coins to a private ledger

I just started buying 2 months ago.  I was going to move them all once I got to my goal of 1 btc.   I didn't realize it was a big deal to leave them on there.   But I will get them off asap
