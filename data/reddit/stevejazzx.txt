jesus this isn't really the list i was expecting 
My list 
1. Buy on gdax not coinbase
Move money via bank avoid lot of fees 
2. If you are going to trade don't go moving btc around willy nilly it takes a long time and costs a lot in fees 
3. Enable two factor everywhere - make sure to back up all seed (inc for seed for 2 factor!) print them out to paper back up for max security 
4. always hold eth ltc and some btc 
5. if you have to move money between exchanges use ltc or eth as a transport coin - check network congestion before moving your coins
6. learn how to triple check coin address visually match the first 4 and last 4 digits  - screenshot that bastard to ensure you dont fuk up and for peace of mind for the time your coins are slow to show 
7. be aware coinbase and even some wallets can change coin receive addresses and really confuse you
8. if using a btc wallet like electrum you dont have to pay the auto set fee  - you can elect a cheaper fee although your transaction could take longer - you can speed up btc sends via antpool.com/prioritisetransaction (needs a free signup)
9. some desktop wallets will sync the entire blockchain of the coin beware of this as it can take ages  - usually you can downlaod a zip file containing transactions to a certain date - if you use a lite or web wallet you can bypass this  
10. using bittrex you can comfortably see upcoming buy and sell orders in green and red - always have a look at this before buying 
11. if you've doubled the value of your coin it is a safe time to sell chances are you can buy back in lower

Trading the market right now and for the short term (next two weeks) I’m seeing an uptrend and btc hitting 7600-7800 before further accumulation 
I am not seeing big dumps happening alts are slowly gaining market cap and correcting 
I would not short the market right now

You can now pay for your Fiat with crypto currency...

I confess not knowing how this works 
Is this Bitcoin that they are transacting? 
Is there a channel open between the coffee shop and the public - forgive my ignorance trying to wrap my head around it - and finally any idea of the approx. fee in this case?

Thanks man

Sincerely Many thanks 
(I get that a node is a pc synced to the blockchain but in this scenario who are the Nodes exactly? If I wanted to open a channel with a node whats the procedure, roughly speaking 
I don't know why Im finding it so hard to grasp the lightning network - i think it's this whole channel business - seems overworked compared to just transacting directly in the stated currency but i know I'm missing some complexities

Yep good analysis op 
However institutional money is balls deep in btc futures and they are controlling the price and of course shorting
We don’t know how much btc on exchanges they control 
I imagine they’ve got a cartel like system and have coordinated pumps and dumps - and of course sell offs
The short is their only play because they can’t control the long - theyll do it until someone catches them, regulates them or locks them up  
At present they’ve been on a massive rinse repeat cycle with no end in site
