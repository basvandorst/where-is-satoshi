Just don't select their premium or basic services(both paid services). In order to remove your paid subscription you have to email them because there's no option to downgrade to the free service the only option is to upgrade to paid service, scummy.

The seed is the string of words generated by the wallet either 12 or 24 default for trezor is 24.  The pin is something user created to access the wallet via the trezor device.  I believe the passphrase is an additional word added to the seed at the beginning.  e.g., 13 words or 25 words

Assuming Satoshi has approximately 1.2 Million Bitcoins.  And that to be richest man in the world he only needs to edge out Bill Gates $81.9 Billion.  That would make a single bitcoin worth $68,333.33.  Using that price for bitcoin anyone with more than 14,635 bitcoins would be a Billionaire.  Now you need to find out how many people own over 14,635 Bitcoins. 
Also at that price point anyone with more than 14.63 Bitcoins be a millionaire

I'm a signer myself, and I've been following the FSP for a few years.  Having spectated from afar it seems to me it attracts mostly transient type people who are looking for a scene to be a part of and eventually move on to something else.   There's supposedly 1,600 + FSP participants already in NH known as early movers, but then they don't account for people who moved to NH and then move back home.  For a project whose entirety is based on numbers their accounting of member numbers is piss-poor.  There's never been an attempt to email participants for a status on when/if they plan to make the move, or how many people have moved back home.  I think the number of replies to a status update would be far more telling than what currently counts for being a participant.

Lawsky's a snake and so are you.
“I applaud those regulators such as Mr. Ben Lawsky of New York who see this vision, and is committed to keeping innovation alive and letting it thrive,” Shrem said. “Before I stepped down as CEO, my company BitInstant was honored to have worked with his office for over a year.”

I don't wish a cage for anyone, but then again you tried to cozy up with the feds. Go to bed with dogs wake up with fleas. Why anyone cares about this guy is beyond me.  Send you stuff? You live in a penthouse in New York City.

Yes, that would be opposite of what he meant.

With such a know-it-all attitude I'd say he didn't know much about it himself until recently.   This has just become the de facto example for Ethereum people trying to make their DAO situation not look so bad.  In reality it's a bad comparison to begin with but any time they can interject it the better.
