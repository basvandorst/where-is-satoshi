Yes I've noticed the price drop, kinda why I want to jump on the opportunity to buy while they are cheaper.

Any of you have any "I wish I knew this earlier moments" when you first got into Bitcoins.

You got to start somewhere...am I right? 
If I see a potential opportunity I don't see why I should have to wait for a real life job to "invest" in something that could potentially become an almost unaffordable "investment" in the near further. I mean funds are available at my disposal that I'm otherwise doing nothing with. Besides putting money aside for RRSP's, and having TSFA's I would like to start investing in something that has potential for real return and gains with money thats simply sitting around not being put to any use. 
Isn't everybody In this market to make money? I mean surly you're not engaging in this for the fun.

Im not expecting to become a millionaire with bit coins (though it would be nice). I'm a full time university student and I'm just looking to do something with the money I have. Make some money while doing nothing so to speak.

There is just so many articles and posts on how to get started all directing you towards different places. I was just wondering if there is a common consensus within the bit coin community that this is the best place to buy/sell/store.
