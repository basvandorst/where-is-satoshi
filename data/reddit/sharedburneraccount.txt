Thats not bitcoin. Its fiat. The whole point of bitcoin was to get away from fiat.

memes are all you people here have left. you have no way to combat the fact that your fees are killing your network so you post memes all day. you have no valid solutions. segwit has proven to be a failure. no one wants to use it or implement it.

LN coins aren't real bitcoins though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:40:01
it's mania dude. bitcoin can't be used as a medium of exchange anymore. it literally has no utility and thus no value. but you believe what you want guy. i've been in this game since 2009.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:53:31
There is no attack. You people are pathetic and so is your obsolete coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:25


it's literally forked from bitcoin...

Memes are all you people have left.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:25:52
The blockchain already forked. If you want a coin you can actually use go with bitcoin cash. If you want some mythical store of value then stick with bitcoin.

LN will be just as popular as segwit is now.

BCH has a finite amount of coins just like BTC. There is no inflation.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:38:56
Ethereum is a meme. Smart contracts are becoming something that any coin can do now. ETC is just as dead and useless as ETH itself.
There no inflation. I don't know why you keep saying that word. How can something that has a finite amount be subject to inflation? Just dumping a bunch of coins into circulation isn't inflation. If it did drive price down it would only do so in the short term as i stated before the EDA will keep it alive.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:57:08


That statement wasn't meant to be taken literally my main rainman.
What i was suggesting is the creation of a completely new coin that has a built in permanently low difficulty thus making it able to be mined on inexpensive resource friendly hardware such as raspi's ardruionos etc etc.
You seem to be a knowledgible person so why don't you tell me why you think what i am describing isn't possible?

The FED decides what it's value is and enforces it as a means of exchange. Bitcoin doesn't have any of that.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:19:40


Calm down now Carl.
It wont matter. Even if the price collapsed a lot it's still a faster network, The EDA will prevent the network from dying. The difficulty rate will just drop to nothing and people will mine it for the fees. BCH is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:58:00
I understand all that just fine. What you are failing to understand is that it wont matter. The EDA will save it time and time again because that's what it's designed to do. The price will continue to go down but eventually it will bottom out when the incentive switches from "mining to generate new coins" to "mining to collect fees."
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:07:13


But my whole point was keeping the diffculty low so it could be mined on low power hardware


If a coin was made that could be cpu mined on a raspi then it could be solar powered thus the cost to run it would be zero. Solar energy is free.
I think you need to just admit that your argument can't dispute these FACTS.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:37:11
I ran a small website on a raspi for an entire year for free so you are either trolling or thermonerddynamics doesn't apply to everything obviously.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:39:32
i don't know but from what i've seen most businesses don't have any particular alligance to any specific coin. They accept whatever is popular and being used by the most people.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:57:20
solar is free after the initial investment in hardware. i don't have to pay the sun gods to use the suns energy.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:28:27


With a small solar panel...
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:42:49
just use bitcoin cash or monero.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:36:56
This doesn't seem very user friendly to me. Seems very complicated. This is very worrying.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:20:22
someone should make a coin that can be mined on a toaster then we could do away with fees and the network could be run by charity since the cost to do so would be virtually 0.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:34:47
Bitcoin's value can only really be assessed by comparing it with a medium of exchange so i don't see how the hospital would know what 0.00000000013 btc would actually be worth unless they compared it with gold or something else.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:30:31


Yea that's gonna be a problem for a lot of people.
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:21:25
Now they need to switch to Monero and it will be completely anonymous.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:17:57
The energy is free and after the savings on the power bill by drawing from the sun the cost of the hardware would become 0.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:28:00
I'm an idiot? Your the educated idiot that actually thinks sun light costs money...
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:51:50
You don't need any fancy asympotic inductions to make it work.
