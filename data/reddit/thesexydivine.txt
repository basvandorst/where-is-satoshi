Just wanted to provide some additional information in regards to this paragraph. There are multiple teams working on bitcoin cash which include Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT and Parity. (They are listed on bitcoincash.org [here]( Each of these have many contributors. These different teams all have a node implementation, much like in Bitcoin where Core has the Bitcoin Core node implementation. 
All these developers previously worked on the Bitcoin Legacy fork. 
The githubs for each of these can be found here (not sure when this article was written but each has commits much more recent that 13 days ago):

How does the hash rate mean very little? If miners stop mining on the 1x chain, users will not even be able to move their coins into exchanges or transact because no blocks will be getting solved

True, not all miners will stop, but if a majority do, the rate of transactions will be significantly slower. If 1x does survive that period, what brings you to the conclusion that miners will return to that chain? If transactions are going smoothly on the other chain, wouldn't everyone just keep their value there, therefore incentivizing miners to continue mining there? 
I'm not really seeing how the "miners are like accountants" works in this situation. You say "Consider this. All the accountants in the US go on strike. Will the USD and the economy collapse? Of course not." But if all accountants go on strike, transacting will still be ongoing, you don't need accountants in order for transactions to go through. In the case of bitcoin, you do need miners for transactions- if all miners went on strike the chain would go stagnant.

But shouldn't the answer be Bitcoin? It was after all created to be a peer to peer electronic cash that would be used as a currency.
