Exactly. I treat it just like Craigslist - if I don't need it quick (most of the stuff I get from Amazon), I'll use it with the mentality of Buyer Beware.
Some things to make life easier - don't buy a bunch of things on the same order, don't try for ridiculous discounts (20% is a good target), make sure your items are available with Prime shipping.

It's disheartening that you missed the majority of 's post and focused so strongly in trying to factually disprove what I read as opinion. 
Jihan's comment and then cm18's both basically suggest we don't miss the forest for the trees, and here we are still focusing on the trees.

It's been about a year since I looked into PoS, but my original comment was directed towards Peercoin. Where you could generally describe bitcoin as hash(last block,nonce)&gt;difficulty, you could describe Peercoin as hash(last block,nonce,timestamp in seconds)*Stake&gt;difficulty.  There's no selection process for the next minter. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 02:33:20
Perhaps the nonce part is left out...the idea is that you can only make one hash per second. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:20:52
I wasn't really trying to make a comparison other than the general form of the equation. 
Yes, you can go back through the blockchain and find a successful point in time - but that is useless. There will be so much competing "stake" built onto the real chain that your solution will not be accepted.
For info, I've searched stake grind and all discussion either revolves around a form of PoS that selects the next block generator or misunderstands Peercoin as having that mechanism.

Copay multisig wallet across multiple devices is great. You can also manage separate wallets in the same app - so you can keep a simple single sig wallet with a smaller balance at the same time.

They are in control of inserting transactions into the blockchain - a fairly significant portion of bitcoin. And the white paper itself sets up proof of work and says that we have to trust a majority of miners to be honest.
What was the point of what you wrote?
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:06:05
Inflation isn't inherent to PoS - it is a separate characteristic to any coin.
Mining is typically termed "minting" and depends on which flavor of PoS is talked about. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 00:17:26
I said in control of a significant portion of bitcoin...not the whole thing.
Honest miners - it's in the abstract and the last line of the first page...not that hard to find.
Do you PoW?
@_date: 2016-08-27 23:32:46
Current fees for bitcoin are around $0.08 / transaction.  Using bitcoin would cost $8,000 for 100,000 transactions. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 07:34:06
Trust me, all business costs are passed on to the buyer.
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:13:09
This only assume a form of PoS where the subsequent minter is selected each block.
I think a more interesting discussion occurs when we discuss using Stake to modify PoW to alleviate inherent centralizing characteristics of PoW (not decreasing overall "work" but spreading it evenly across user base)
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:45:26
This is why POW was invented.  Node count, while interesting, is only a number.

I don't care about the character of the people supporting the system. The system stands or falls on its own merits.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:31:47
2 isn't so bad from a user's perspective - but miners would potentially be decimated in that time period from a combined price drop without a difficulty adjustment.  At the same time, the miner population is reduced to result in less diversity (more centralization?).
Would it work to externally subsidize mining for this time period?  Would it be better to do  from the time of the split?  If we do  are there any other optimizations we could include?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:17:36
Roger gas been supporting bitcoin since long before separate projects...perhaps we should decide to use anything other than bitcoin.
Or, just conveniently forget that and spread character assassination now that it promotes your agenda.

It's a statement about independent reasoning and freedom of personal choice.

Pretty sure it's 40 cents per transaction according to 21's website.  Math is off?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:01:52
Maybe it's timing, but I still see 20,000 transactions with higher fees.  This number has been continually renewed for some time now.  
Miners are free to include lower fee transactions if they have other reasons to do so.

If the price of bitcoin had dropped, it is quite safe to assume that any user in that situation wouldn't be on reddit thanking coinbase for saving their money.

Your logic is bad.  "Of course this cup is big enough to hold all of the water in the world - see, it is full of water."

And when everyone does this?  Why not just say "keep waiting".
We might as well sticky your comment and get rid of all of these threads...

Wholeheartedly agree.  It's like everyone would rather focus on the destruction of each other than the promotion or improvement of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:32:16
I didn't say coffee money.  I'm simply talking new interest, new talent, any kind of real excitement.  I, having been around bitcoin for 5 years, see little to actively attract new people.  Admittedly, I feel too absorbed in the stupid blocksize debate...but I also see it as a huge detractor to the entire bitcoin ecosystem.
Like I said, it's not catastrophic.  Rather, a question of what might have been or what could be were we to get back to that atmosphere 
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:06:55
But just as reasonably, we see regular posts about bad user experience.  We also have no way of telling what would be happening in bitcoin space if the block size limit had been changed two years ago.
I mean that in terms of additional interest in development, additional use cases, full node count, any of it.
I do agree, today's backlog is no cause for immediate concern that everything is going to collapse - but I'm also aware that it may not stay that way for long.

It's possible that someone studies traffic / queuing patterns and understands how to optimally create or increase a backlog of unconfirmed transactions such that new transactions will continue to have higher fees for some time.
Using round numbers for example:
If fees now were $0.1, I stop putting transactions in blocks.  (At the same time I reduce my risk of orphans for a while).  That drives the backlog up quite quickly given currently full blocks.  Say an hour or two later, fees have increased to $0.15.  How long would it take for fees to go back down to $0.1?  Would you be able to keep the increased fees for 3 hours?  5?  Can you do this at particular times of the day to maximize effect?
Again, bitcoin is based on miners acting in their own self interest.  This could be another example of that.
Edit: it would of course be in each users' self interest to counteract this by studying fee history and seeing if it oscilates throughout the day and pick a time when it is lowest.
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:22:49
He's asking what we can do when miners don't include transactions.  Your answer before was "Pay the fee. Get the confirmation."

Where's to tell you to pay a bigger fee and give more incentive to have your transaction included.

In the software he published, there was an alert mechanism for upgrades.

It's not intended to suggest that.  Satoshi had been working on the code for a while and (as much as anyone) understood the code would not be perfect.  If there is a need to update the code, how would that be done, what difficulties might occur, and what is the decision mechanism?

Just because you don't know the number now doesn't mean it isn't capped.  I guarantee it won't be infinite.
Edit: let me edit this to say I can certainly see the value in knowing there is a cap.  I would suggest that human behavior, particularly when it comes to rate of change in price as this sub should be interested in, has very little to do with that absolute cap that will be reached in the future.
The rate of change in the block reward should be discussed instead.
