Because bitcoin is english and they are speaking mandarin. Dollar is an english word, yet people in Spain don't pronounce "dollar". They say dólar which is dollar in spanish.
比特币 "Bǐtè bì" is the chinese translation for "bitcoin". Many direct english translations are done using like syllables. 
bì means coin in chinese. Bit-bì is rather hard to say, so you get Bǐtèbì for bitcoin

My first encryption is with Truecrypt. I then .rar that container file with a separate password.
And yes, I should look into hidden temp files.
EDIT: Looks like I should be doing the other way around due to the chance of temporary un-encrypted files. RAR the Truecrypt container instead of having the Truecrypt container holding a RAR.
This way if someone were to obtain a temp file, they would still be stuck with an encrypted truecrypt container, rather than my .txt or .jpg file.

That's just part of the algorithm used to calculate the priority queue to be accepted. Because not all nodes receive the same transactions at the same time, you can't use first come first serve, you need some preset algorithm.
A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.
All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)


Transactions need to have a priority above 57,600,000 to avoid the enforced limit (as of client version 0.3.21).

Only the miner that actually finds the next block gets the reward (25btc, every 10minutes). And from what I am aware of, there are no minimum number of transactions per block, but you still have to find the valid block which is very difficult to do.
Increasing the block size does not have any major repercussions other than implementing a hard fork and notifying all miners to upgrade to the new version. They also have to decide a good number so that they probably won't have to keep increasing the size every so often.

Your two sentences are not mutually exclusive. Yes you can day trade bitcoins to make a profit. When doing so, you leave USD and Bitcoins BOTH on bitstamp, it doesnt have to repeatedly go back to your bank account. I can sell 10 bitcoins for $6000, and leave that money in bitstamp. Then when I want to rebuy, I can spend it. I can also choose to have that money transfered back into my Bank.
There has to be SOME method of getting the funds from an exchange to and from your bank. This is done either through ACH or Wire transfer, or SEPA if you are EU.
If you don't want to attach a bank, you will have to buy bitcoins locally with cash. Once you have bitcoins, you can transfer those to the exchange and trade as well...

It's not manipulation. People will always charge a premium if they have to do extra work to sell their coins (go to local coffee shop to meet you).
Every legit exchange will require the "hassle" of setting up. This is in guidelines with anti-money laundering and KYC laws. Wire transfers and ACH transfers can take several days and that is completely the fault of our current banking infrastructure. It's horrid and extremely slow, especially when comparing to bitcoin.

seems like you misunderstand the most basic properties of bitcoin. you want to send $1 in bitcoin while price is $10k/coin? Send them 0.0001 bitcoin. That's = to $1. Bitcoin actually needs to grow to the several thousands to be useful as a currency. the current marketcap is too low for mass usage.

Hey feel free to PM me any questions and I will try my best to give proper explanations or analogies.
I've had quite a bit of success explaining bitcoin to both my parents who are also in their mid 50's.
As to why he cannot own bitcoin without a computer:
Bitcoin can be compared to as email. You don't NEED to own a computer to have email, but you do need to access one if you want to send or read your latest mail. Email is entirely digital and not something you can have physical, unless you of course use a printer to print out the contents of a particular email.
Same with bitcoin, you have a bitcoin address where you can receive bitcoins. You don't need to be near a computer to receive coins likewise with email. But you do need to be at one to send them to someone else. 
A bitcoin address is similar to email address as well. It is just a username and password. username is to public key whereas password is to private key.
Comparisons to email:
* hugh_jackman is to 16thaaczqfZnLNixtYeeYhkbjS7R3fGmCQ
* password123 is to 5KWqDfE8b77q8nkSzmNCr2tPao9ao9AVsgwAxHRJZSkJdx3vYWC
Now blockchain.info is a wallet that just allows you to access all your addresses and privatekeys at once. Similar to how you can use Outlook or Apple Mail to read emails from all your different email accounts (yahoo + gmail + hotmail, etc).
He can either create a blockchain.info account to store these keys online, or even simpler write it on a physical piece of paper and store it as a "physical" wallet.

Unfortunately that is just the way exchanges work. You are not Buying or Selling your coins to Bitstamp. They are merely connecting you to another party to perform the trade. It is an interface.
If you are trying to sell 10 BTC, and three people want to buy, one for 2btc, one for 3btc, and another for 5btc, that is three transactions.
Imagine if you go to a restaurant with two friends and want to split the bill so each person pays with their own credit card. If the restaurant charges an arbitrary $1 fee for using credit card, each individual will  have to pay this credit card fee. You can't just bundle all three together and say each person only pays 33 cents to add up to the $1 fee.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:56:14
You do not need a transaction fee for large movements.
The priority of a transaction being accepted into a block is weighted on transaction size AND fee. If your size is large enough, there is no need for a fee.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:36:05
Your thinking is flawed. Bitcoin did not start form $7 or $12. It started from 0. Even if you set the starting rate at the first bitcoin purchase (10K btc for 1 Pizza) that is roughly a value of $0.002/bitcoin.
This means bitcoin has already grown 500,000x from $0.002 to $1000. There is no "first" 100x increase.
Secondly, you cannot compare bitcoin to public stock market. That is because these companies IPO at a start price, whereas bitcoin started from $0. If bitcoin were a company, it would still be private and you would not be able to buy "shares".
Facebook IPO'd at $38/share with a market cap of $100Billion. It also "grew" from $0 to $100Billion, but during that time the company was private, so you no one includes that as part of the market growth.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:51:15
What happens in this scenario?
Individual buys 10 btc at $100 basis. He then gambles 10BTC and wins 9 additional BTC.
BTC Market price becomes $1000.
What is his basis on the 9 extra BTC? Is it even classified as capital gain asset or is it in an entirely different bracket because it was gambling?
I've been to vegas a few times and never had to pay taxes on my earnings from my earnings. Is there a limit where you start having to pay taxes on gambling?
Likewise, what if I LOSE 9BTC from gambling. BTC rises to $1000 and I sell my 1 btc left. Does that mean I pay taxes on $900 worth of gains even though I lost 9k worth of bitcoins?

You have two payment options.
First post in [bitcointalk](
1. Find a buyer in person and trade locally
2. Sell to someone further away and ship it to them.
For number2, you will need to find a trusted escrow on the forums. There is still risk involved with number 2, so make sure you read reviews of both parties.
Potential risks include:
 * usps, fedex, or ups loses your package
 - buyer claims he never receives the package, up to escrow to decide who receives funds
 - escrow doesn't send you the funds
In my opinion these are the two only safe options. Craigslist is another option, but make sure you only accept cash or BTC on the spot. If cash, I would recommend bringing a counterfeit pen like [this one](

I think it would require significantly large capital ($100k+) plus connections to these manufactures directly to have significant profit.
Think about it... Why would they sell money printing machines for less than they could "print" themselves?
Most of these companies turn greedy... They delay their sales and instead use their own machines to mine as much as possible. Once they calculate that the profits have slowed down due to the increasing difficulty, they put it on the market for layman to buy.
Another thing to note. You always see "PRE ORDER NOW", but you never see a product listed as "SOLD OUT"... If something was SOLD OUT, that means the BUYERs are actually making profit, but that never happens.

Is there a maximum amount of USD you can keep on the USD wallet? Or maximum single transaction? I'm assuming the 50k daily sell limit will put some restrictions on people using coinbase as an "exchange" medium?
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:02:44
The number of transactions in each block fluctuates as it depends how many floating transactions need to be fit into the next block to be confirmed. The current limiting factor is the maximum size of the block.
I believe the current size of each block is 1MB, so it can fit as many transactions until 1MB is used up. You can see the avg size of a block here: [here](
Once the 1MB limit is reached, the developers will increase the size of each block, but they do not feel it is necessary at the moment.
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:35:13
Well you should go to the sites first and read about it. Localbitcoins is essentially craigslist. You meet someone in person to buy coins and pay in cash. The seller gets to set the price.

@_date: 2013-07-28 19:25:04
This has been asked several times.
There are arbitrage opportunities, but is often not worth the time and risk. I've done it before and sometimes it's good, but most of the time it's not worth it. This is what the process would look like.
* Send money from bank to Dwolla (1 week)
* Transfer USD from Dwolla to CampBX to buy coins.
* Pay CampBX transaction fees.
* Send BTC to MtGox and wait 6 confirmations and hope price doesn't drop during this time
* Sell BTC on MtGox and pay transaction fee
* Initiate withdraw request on MtGox and pay withdraw fee + international wire transfer banking fees.
* Price changes during BTC transfer between exchanges
* Keeping USD on Dwolla for extended periods waiting for an arbitrage opportunity
* Delay in funds being sent from Mt.Gox back to bank account
* Funds may get locked up in either exchange anytime
* Wire transfer from Mt.gox has pretty high intermediate fees, so it is only worth while if you transfer large sums of cash to one bank, yet if you transfer large sums of cash, the bank may get suspicious of your recent activity and your bank account may get locked up or watched.
I did this entire process once with $5000 and ended up with $150 profit after 2 weeks of delay times. I'm risking $5000 with lots of potential of something going wrong for $150. Plus these arbitrage opportunities don't always exist, so you have to be comfortable leaving that 5K in dwolla, which is probably not ideal either.
This method used to be a lot easier back when Coinbase used Mt. Gox's price exclusively, but now that it does not, the gap is nonexistent.

I am 22 yrs old and a senior in college. I started by investing $300 at 20. Then I saw it grow to 25 and invested another 300. 
Come now, I've invested a total of 5k USD and my average price is around 45. My net worth in bitcoin is around 14k now...
It's been an interesting ride. Learning everyday :)
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:28:19
you're too late
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:04:00
And why don't you use the major exchanges?
Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, CampBX...
Btc-e is the most obscure exchange ever unless you live in bulgaria/russia...
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:14:40
i'm interested. teach me
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:58:08
print it out.
send your btc to the Bitcoin Address: listed on the piece of paper.
You can then import the private key back onto mt gox when you want to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:30:18
DO I BUY BACK IN??? :\
sold at 135.
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:04:03
I was under the impression that if you ever SOLD btc into USD, and bought back in. That still counts as PROFIT that needs to be reported.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:29:05
you sir are in the "new paradigm" phase. beware.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:05:07
yes but coinbase is practically matching mtgox, and bitstamp is only about 5% different now. 
As of now, it is far from an illusion.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:50:38
the one issue is. there is a slight chance that by bailing, you flag yourself as a "high-risk" user on coinbase, thus blacklisting yourself by buying at a future time...
risk is up to you.

Would someone owe taxes if something like this happened?
1. Buy 1 bitcoin at $400.
2. Sell 1 bitcoin for $800
3. Bitcoin crashes to $400, person uses $800 to buy 2BTC.
4. Bitcoin continues to crash to $200 and person sells 2BTC for $400 total.
I'm a bit confused in these events. Does the person still owe taxes since he realized gains at $800? or does it even out since his net profit is 0 for the year?

@_date: 2013-03-05 03:00:45
A few slight problems to take into consideration:
Mt. Gox charges 0.6% per transaction.
If you needed to refill $ on Mt. Gox, you would have to use a fast method, such as ziggap, which also charges like 3%.
Not sure if bitfloor also charges transaction fee, but if you add them all together, it probably wouldnt even be worth it
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:57:23
um I guess you haven't been here for a while? 20% drops happen every week... they last a good 3-4 hours
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:14:37
That's because some people have been through this 5-6 times already... I'm assuming this is your first bubble crash?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:41:36
a majority of the demand comes from people that bought in at 500+. I highly doubt people with 100+ coins as of now are still actively buying more...
Once whales start cashing out to become millionaires, everyone will lose confidence and will be unsure when to buy back in because it keeps dropping lower. No one wants to buy in to an immediate loss.
You know that feeling everyone has right now because they keep making money? Imagine that same sensation but losing money. Emotions snowball fast.

Wouldn't gold/silver buyers only pay you around 75-80% of what the market price of gold/silver is worth?
Thus, evening out what you would pay for taxes anyways... A quick wire transfer seems much less work than going through hoops of buying gold, finding a gold seller, and then exchanging thousands of cash back into my bank account.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:34:19
obviously not.
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:47:12
Dwolla/Gox can definitely be a headache, since you have to wait so long to finally receive the funds. 
Localbitcoins can be great, especially since the seller usually sells for higher than market price... but it's pretty hard to find buyers if you don't live in a popular city.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:03:54

It executed at: 0.01000000 BTC at $68.65000 which was market order. I then used 68cents I had in my account to do a BUY order of 75$/coin. It executed at:
0.00989652 BTC at $68.99999

@_date: 2013-03-12 03:34:48
Honestly, the only way to catch these drifts is to already have a buy order on mtgox with cash at lets say 90% of market price before it starts dipping.
Once it crashes, the delays are so long that you will set a price, and after the delay you're bid will be too low.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:31:53

The transaction history looks like this:
The weird thing is... I DON'T OWN address 1K5hLyguMutgKH3p2E9v1irf1AwY8T993Z
I even did dumpprivkey 1K5hLyguMutgKH3p2E9v1irf1AwY8T993Z and bitcoin-qt says 
Private key for address 1K5hLyguMutgKH3p2E9v1irf1AwY8T993Z is not known (code -4)
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:00:35
Actually I don't think its an 8300 IRS Form that you linked. An exchange would never pay you in "cash", and the form says ACH and Wire transfers are not considered in 8300 forms.

but i'm pretty sure you wouldnt be able to get your coins over there anyways
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:25:14
thanks, now I don't feel as bad. two days ago when btc dropped to $50, I had the coin flip of leaving in usd or btc. I made the mistake of leaving in usd and woke up to a 40% rise back up to the 70s. while I made quite a bit of money trading that entire day during the drop, that mistake set me back quite a bit of potential BTC worth far more than my usd profits. thought it might push to the 40's when i woke up :\
guess i'll have to diversify more...
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:44:20
I was waiting for my dwolla-&gt;mtgox transaction to process after 7 hours. I left a buy order for $47.9...  now i wish I never set that up :( could have bought at 44.

I believe so. Quicker than typing it in though!
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:32:22
I would totally sell on localbitcoins. But a majority of my transactions happen during major dips in the market where I don't have time to find a buyer. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:50:52
Oops. You are correct. This is more of a a^b^x then.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:57:49
sometimes market order during lag is necessary. for example if you're trying to cash out during a peak crash, however you don't know what price to sell since there is so much lag. if you attempt to sell at a specific price with 5minute lag, chances are the value is already below your price and your coins will never sell. 
by the time you realize your sell price was too high, the price might have dropped another 10-15%. Market order will make sure your order goes through as fast as possible.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:29:27
If someone traded in the past... lets say 2011/2012 and never reported their capital gains earnings, is it possible for Mt. Gox to send the IRS every user's transaction logs from the past and have the IRS audit, essentially screwing over everyone since no one has really filed it back then/now?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:03:30
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:07:25
a bulk wallet wallet is just 3 different addresses. it's like having a checking account AND a savings account. If you wanted to split up your funds, you can use a bulk account. 
a single wallet is just 1 address.
a paper wallet is the same exact thing as above, but it has the pretty images to look like an actual cash bill. None of the images actually matter though. The public and private key are all you need to print out.
Choose whichever one you like.
@_date: 2013-03-20 07:56:58
you won't be making decent profit with 0.77BTC. Even if bitcoin SHOOTS to 120, which it wont in the next month. you will only double up. which is like 40$? That's like a nice dinner out.

I can only see a surge this high if an external factor is released, such as Ebay officially accepting bitcoin.
There can also be negative news during this time which will TANK bitcoin.
Imagine what will happen if next week Gavin announces that [this]( is indeed a fatal flaw and requires a hard fork?
Cheap shares for sure.

i would never keep money on an exchange for an extended period of time. for example +1 month. They don't need to be hacked for you to lose your money. What if one day you need to sell your coins but their website is down? You have no way of accessing your own funds.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:25:08
Your time perception is skewed. I've notice this happen to many people that follow bitcoins everyday and stare at charts everyday. You think you've been at it for ages, but in reality its only been a few weeks.
Bitcoin first hit 80's in early/mid April, which is 2 months ago. Just going back 6 months, bitcoin was only worth 15-20$/coin.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:54:25
What exchange did you use? Where are you from?
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:49:03
i've already "traded" on mt. gox though. I assume I would need to file capital gains since I at one point in time traded the bitcoin into usd, and usd back into bitcoin on their exchange. So even if i hold for long term, the trading still counts as short term capital gains i believe.

22 year old, senior in college. I put in roughly 50% of my savings account. I already have food and rent covered, so my lifestyle won't change if I were to lose it all. I have just over 100BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:50:36
it's sort of changed my outlook on bitcoins. I've decided not to sell and just hold out for a few years. 
Withdrawing 10k won't really change my life. I got a job lined up for after college and so might as well ride this crazy rollercoaster to the end :)
Maybe it will be 100k or $1M in a few years. who knows...
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:33:08
tomorrow? you can't.
you can sell 50 on coinbase and it will arrive around 3 business days. but since its way over $10,000 you will probably have to call ahead and inform the bank so it wont be frozen. Then you will have to file capital gains and give up 30% or so to taxes.
You can also do the same via Bit Stamp and pay for an international wire transfer. Probably take 1 week. And you'll be taxed as well.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:28:47

@_date: 2013-04-17 23:22:12
wouldn't you often make more $ if you just held btc longterm on an uptrend than making the occasional 5% gain from arbitrage?
moving fiat from exchange back to bank back to exchange usually takes 1+week.
do you do this because the gains are safer than holding btc itself?
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:30:29
Every method requires re-buying BTC on Mt. Gox and transferring them to another exchange.
Coinbase is probably fastest and easiest. CampBX will also work, but they have lower volume.
If you wish to keep funds on the exchange and trade while still maintaining liquidity, BitStamp is the go to place now. Since you're from US, you will still have to pay foreign wire transfer fee's similar to Mt. Gox, but at least you will receive the $$$.
You need to become verified on Bitstamp, but they verified my documents in 24 hours.

That's the fascinating thing. A patch will probably be rolled out within 12-24 hours and miners will be notified to upgrade.
But during that time the crowd will get nervous and many weak hands will sell.
Heck, I would probably sell too if I can get the chance before it goes into free fall, just so I can rebuy at a lower amount a few minutes later.
I try to short term trade similar to how people play poker in regards that I react on how others will seem to react, and less on how bitcoin is doing.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:06:07
mtgox is actually performing very well... its not their fault this time. people are just selling.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:02:49

@_date: 2013-04-24 21:15:17
the big scare was that the bitcoin-qt doesnt show my change addresses under "receive coins" so I thought it was sent elsewhere. Just found this exact problem someone else had.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:39:38
if you're already verified by now, just initiate a dwolla-&gt;gox order. i still find it the most convenient since there are no fees. otherwise just use bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-07-28 23:42:35
Yeah, i tested this a few months ago when coinbase sell price was based off mtgox.
It went very smooth and I even received my $ in my bank within 48 hours. Mt gox on the other hand took a week and over $30 of wire transfer fee's out of a $1000 withdraw.
The arbitrage is worse now since coinbase no longer follows the higher mtgox price :(
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:15:51
I knew i should have sold last night =\. Would have been able to rake in so much more :D
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:41:17
For North Americans, I find coinbase and bitinstant to be the two easiest options to buy bitcoins. Coinbase charges 1% but takes a week to process, whereas bitinstant finalizes in roughly an hour, but requires walking to a physical CVS and placing a moneygram order. They also charge the most since they offer the quickest service. 
While you wait for your bitcoins to arrive, consider setting up a Mt. Gox and Dwolla account. The whole process should take 1-month to get everything verified, but once it's setup, it is currently the most streamlined and cheapest method to move money from your bank to Mt. Gox to buy coins in the exchange, and also withdraw.
I like the easy interface of blockchain.info, so I use that as my current wallet. It allows both paper and hybrid e-wallet formats.

Well lets say I one day make a considerable amount of $ from holding bitcoin long term. How do I convert BTC back to USD without getting unwanted attention? I would figure a 100K+ wire transfer into my bank would call for some alarms.
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:13:58
yeah i prob should. if i buy them back now.. i lose out on 6 coins.
but then again, i can just take out the 5k originally and make it a risk free investment..

for a newbie, just use  easiest method to create a wallet, and you can access from any browser with internet. you can also export the private key and store it offline in case the website happens to be down and you still need access.
as for investing, it all depends how much you are comfortable. I have a considerable amount of coins, and plan on putting 20% of future savings into bitcoins.
for example if my salary is 100k a year, and plan on putting 20k in savings, I would instead put 4k into bitcoins and 16k into other investments/savings.
up to you how big of the pie you wish bitcoins to take up.

I'll basically keep most of my btc and maybe cash out 40% for now as it's so volatile, but keep the funds in Dwolla. If it returns to the strong bull market we had in early April, I can always rebuy, and if I need funds for asia, I can always transfer to my bank.
