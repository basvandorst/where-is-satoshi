I popped my bitcoin cherry by winning a bitcoin for posting in this thread.

Bits are cool too.

"proved I was black", "blew you guys", what?

Could have never hit confirm when ordering. I made this dumb mistake once...

I second the pin code, and request that it also be touch ID integrated.
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:29:42
Another possible solution is to browse in incognito mode in chrome when dealing with anything bitcoin related. Incognito mode disables all extensions and does not ask you to remember passwords (another common mistake).

Jailbreak your iPhone and the Blockchain app is readily available for download via Cydia.

Keep up the good work. I would route that value given on the home view out to the springboard badge and have it update periodically. Easy method to add in ;)
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:44:04
Jailbreak your phone? The OP is trying to spread awareness, telling others to jailbreak their phones to demonstrate the usage of bitcoin is not showing them ease of use... Read.... Write... But Read first.

I just sent a micro bitcoin to China. It worked.

Jeeze, now we are publicizing what this poor man buys?

Your a stamp.

USAA is the shiz. Glad to hear their interest in bitcoin.

Circle only does instant with debit cards (not bank accounts or credit cards). This tricked me into thinking they no longer did instant when my buys defaulted to bank account and I had to start selecting my debit card. Source: I bought instant from them today.

Bcashers are so dumb with their scams! Let's fork this wallet and do the opposite :)

We are soooooo winning! Bcash doesn't have segwit so they mad.

Oops, I'll fix the audio. It was my first time using Streamium, very cool first impression though! How did the picture quality look? This stream is not always running, but it could be. I would of course lower the price if it were a 24 hour live stream.

First off, the latest iOS is 8 and we are almost to 9. Second, plenty of wallets support iOS 7. And for even older iOS versions, there is always web wallets.

How do you choose a buyer? Is that an option? I thought buyers choose you.

all or nothing, do it.

Looks pretty interesting. I will play around with this more but here are some upfront suggestions: 1) needs QR scanner to input bitcoin address. 2) raise the bonus reward, 1/20th of a cent to watch a 30 second video, no thanks. 3) needs to show more detailed balance, history of transactions, pending withdraw, etc
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:08:27
BSV isn't getting delisted because it causes confusion. It's getting delisted because the the fraudsters behind it are toxic and suing developers. This hurts the entire crypto community.

Thank you very much! Yes, I have used EOBot for years, since it was founded. I like the way it has grown over time. Keep up the good work. BTW, I would love to see a simple standalone app for Mac (like the windows one).

They decentralized the spam attack on a decentralized currency... Inception.

So glad I didn't follow up after my interview there. I applied as an iOS developer, saw that they were doing things in Cordova instead of natively and then I quickly moved on.

The Apple stocks app that is default installed on your iPhone and Apple watch can function as a bitcoin ticker. It has a nice widget for the watch face as well.  Search for and add "BTCUSD=X" in the stocks app.

As a member that was just invited to join their "pilot program" to "enjoy" this feature- its not that cool! Its the same as linking any other bank account to USAA. The funds are visible on the your USAA dashboard, but you can't modify them. Whooptidoo!!..Who gives a f*. You still cannot buy, sell, or transfer fiat/BTC without going to Coinbase.

Copay is built using Cordova, not native. That alone is enough not to download the app.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:26:58
Doesn't price per bitcoin directly dictate the market cap though?

I don't think the Pixel is available on Amazon yet, but the iPhone 7 is. Any items can be purchased with bitcoins on amazon through purse.io, and at a discount ;)

Breadwallet requires Touch ID to send transactions which is way better than a 4 digit PIN or passphrase in my opinion.

Too bad Copay is built with Cordova for mobile apps. Native would have made for an efficient, fast app.
