Actually, the 1933 Act and Reg D were passed in the wake of the Great Depression, in reaction to the so-called "Lochner era" of freedom of contract. 
The truth is that regulations swing like a pendulum.

Agreed that the accusations of impropriety are inappropriate, but I would object to calling what Lawsky posted a "first draft", because I don't think it will change much.
NYDFS will of course administer the notice and comment period and give due consideration to whatever public comments they receive (as they are required to do), but I would not expect much to come of it. 
What we're looking at has almost certainly been vetted by key stakeholders already (hence the delay?) in one form or another. Lawsky would not post something this high-profile that he thought would get torn to bits or that would make him look stupid.
That said, there's likely a red herring or two in here that are set up to attract and incorporate public comments, so that when the dust settles the optics of the regs look more like a "partnership" and less like coercion. Perhaps [this crew]( is available for a road trip to NY?

Good call on using Snapcard -- although unless I'm trying to unload my coins or prove a point I don't see why I would. My understanding is that Snapcard charges a buy-side 2% fee, which would be on top of whatever premium EK is already charging me to subsidize their CC fees. Clearly I would be better off paying EK with a CC, even before factoring in rewards and chargeback protection. Right?

My bad! This [Slate article]( says it all - do give it a read. 
Basically, it calls the health care decision a conservative master stroke, because the Court (i) upheld the individual mandate as a constitutional exercise of Congress' (deeply unpopular) taxation power, (ii) established new limitations on Congress' commerce clause power, which had been expanding for decades, and (iii) improved the Court's partisan reputation, giving the conservative majority some headroom to "gut the Commerce clause" in future decisions.  
I know that's light on detail, but I'll let the Slate article take it home. A few more resources:
* This [article]( from the Nation goes over the same stuff
* This [WaPo article]( presents some counter-arguments
* This [excerpt]( from SCOTUSblog explains the decision in one paragraph
Of course, that leaves the question of what has happened since. And tbh I don't know! I'm a lawyer but con law is not my bag, and so I haven't kept up with whether the Court has taken a commerce clause case since. If you see anything interesting I'm all ears.

Referral program would be for merchant sign ups, not end user sign ups (i.e. your barber, not your dad).
Bitpay and Coinbase are direct competitors in that space so an attractive referral program seems like a no brainer, with first mover advantages. 
For end users, Coinbase does have a referral program but it's not exactly exciting (I think 5 bucks, after a $100 purchase). And I'd agree that they needn't crank that up given their lack of competitors.

I agree with everything you said. For big companies we dont need chargebacks but for small companies sometimes we do.  Moreover a small merchant might invite chargeback functionality, because it would persuade a consumer to take a chance on them.
What i dont understand is why I as a consumer dont have a transparent choice, i.e. for any transaction, I have the option to pay 2% more for chargeback rights.

Yes but they only sell $50 and $100 gift cards so for a fancy ring you'd have to purchase (and then redeem) dozens individually. And unfortunately there's no way to automate, per Gyft support.

Please don't be cynical! These comments WILL get read and yours could make all the difference. So much of politics is just showing up, and so many people talk themselves out of doing so -- the result is that those who bother get a proportionately louder voice.

The regs seem designed to level the playing field, to sandbag bitcoin companies with all the nonsense that other financial services companies are saddled with. 
As I see it, the problem is that not only are those rules ill fitting for bitcoin companies but they are rather accommodating for legacy players (who have spent plenty on lobbying and compliance) and so now bitcoin companies will be at a real competitive disadvantage out of the gate. 
Yuck. So where is the regulatory safe haven going to be? My money is on TX and HK.

My view is that if you disagree with your government's outlays then you should push to change it or leave. But free riding is not an interim solution -- better to spend a few bucks and keep the moral high ground than to expose yourself to accusations of impropriety and audit risk.
That said (and as pointed out) tax avoidance is a great strategy, and a legitimate alternative to evasion.

@_date: 2014-07-19 17:27:40
Not to diminish your point or to disparage the man's record, but I do think there's an element of the fox watching the hen house here. His tenure as Superintendent has a shelf life, and he usually these guys will pop up afterward on the payroll of one of the finance firms they regulate, as a "Special Advisor" or some such. 
That's not to say that he's a crony or even that he has a conflict of interest -- I just wouldn't take it on faith that he's say that he's hitting banks hard just because that's in his job description.

Thank you for this post. I am withholding judgment until Danny has had his day in court but if nothing else this story will serve as a cautionary tale for others. (Same goes for the NB team: If this is the whole truth then my heart goes out to you, but I will reserve on that for now.) Two questions:
1. Roughly speaking, how many customers' bitcoins have been lost, and how many customers are affected?
2. Why did NB personnel entrust Danny with their personal Bitcoins (the 50 btc mentioned)? I would suspect they opened NB accounts, but if they are knowledgeable regarding BTC security that would hardly seem necessary.

I would say 418k to attend conferences is a lot. For salaries, the big question is devotion of time - were these full time jobs? Many, many directors of nonprofits do not take salaries because the positions are not at all full time.

Looks like the 2014 financials may go out internally next week (per a post I saw from Patrick Murck) but the 2014 990 isn't due until May 15, so new info may take a while to get out to the masses.

OP: 
@_date: 2015-04-25 05:05:45
They certainly don't, the post is exaggerating. I suspect Coinbase is including total compensation of compliance staff (who wear lots of other hats), fees of outside counsel (who again serve many functions) and then finally, what they actually spent on MSB registration and compliance. Not sure how else they could have gotten to that figure. 
As far as bonds, I would hope that they are not tallying the face amount for this purpose -- it's the cost of capital that matters.

Anyone can underprice a market leader for a period of time. What matters is market share, and unfortunately that trends toward zero for new participants. The problem is that remittance customers are sticky -- no one wants to lose everything chasing lower fees with an unknown startup.

But splits happen all the time in the stock of well-known companies (eg Baidu) without any pandemonium and in fact, they often thrive. To quote a great philosopher, life finds a way.
Edit: All you'd need is a half-sentence afterthought in news articles for about 6 months, e.g "The price of bitcoin, which was split 1000:1 on January 1, 2014, rose 3% today..."  Is that so bad? I think we can handle it. 
More problematic to me is 'WTF is a Satoshi? If he's anonymous what's to stop him from stealing my coins?'
Obviously no one here would take that view but for purposes of main stream adoption I don't see a reason or a need to emphasize that part of the Bitcoin story.

All you need to make and receive btc payments is a dumb phone. And if you need local hard currency, a btc ATM.  Granted, ATMs are scant right now, but they'll proliferate. 
I suspect WU will pivot at some point and buy out one of these ATM startups. If there's one thing we know it's that they seek to maximize profits, and if nothing else it seems like those things will wipe out overhead.
That said, they could miss the boat if they dawdle. Their market dominance in payments will insulate them for a while but probably less than they think.

You're right, she definitely made that clear. But just because she was voicing her personal views doesn't mean they aren't consistent with her clients' interests. (Hence why she said her testimony doesn't *necessarily* reflect the opinions of her clients.)
She wasn't speaking today out of altruism. It was BD, and laying the groundwork for what she'll later argue on behalf of her clients.  Drumming up work, so to speak, and establishing herself as an expert.
At the same time, just because her personal views are consistent with her clients' interests doesn't mean that she was being dishonest. I might disagree with her but I certainly don't see any reason to question her integrity. No need to call her a shill.

Debit cards that are processed online also fit that bill, outside of KYC/application hassles. Granted, entering a PIN at the POS is a hassle but then again so are on-blockchain BTC transactions...
I don't see how BTC is a CC slayer. The best feature of credit cards is that they facilitate credit-based purchases, and so in that way aren't they superior to using the BTC protocol? Of course, third parties can extend credit denominated in BTC, but I don't see how that's a step forward, since those organizations will no doubt charge whatever interest rates the market will bear.  In traditional CCs buyers have bargained for high interest rates in exchange for easy credit, and sellers have bargained for chargebacks in exchange for stimulated sales.  Why wouldn't history repeat itself?
