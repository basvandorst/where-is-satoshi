the topic in depth here: 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:40:17
Mr. Schneider-Amman is the head of the federal department of economic affairs, education and research  
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:54:13
the question caught him by surprise but at the end he was very honest admitting that he does not know about bitcoin but he is curious
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:06
more people are realizing the true value of the new money
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:00
he has done great good sharing his ideas with us, well deserved!
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:55:16

bitcoin as a store  of value is more than ready for anyone! If it's approved ... enjoy the show! If it isn't, then get ready to buy cheap! 
@_date: 2017-02-20 03:47:54
every citizen should know what bitcoin is
@_date: 2017-02-18 03:08:55
Rocks! 30 years of history in an hour!
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:21:07
bitcoin price would go up once people in China and in ROW start paying and getting paid with bitcoin in everyday transactions using simple lightweight wallets without any kind of transaction fee
@_date: 2016-03-24 18:54:15
this will be possible using smart contracts 
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:32:18
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:23:28
His point is precisely that video conferences started hugely expensive and 20 years after they are almost free
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:59:36
Due to recent government regulation on exchanges, Chinese people moved to buy and sell through localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:48:10
Some miners represent the big power that follow profit, bitcoin core is the manufactured enemy and the consent is to follow x or y altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:49:45
just around the corner
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:21:21
I did not know about this details. Looks really great!!! Hope that miners finally see this. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:00:46
plus there is no need to register any buy of a daily morning coffee in the blockchain. LN is the solution for that. First layer for store of value, second layer for morning coffee transactions 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:31:20
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:23:24
If fees skyrocket, solutions will come. In my opinion segwit is best since it fixes malleability bug, though it will take some more months to activate. Wallets and exchanges will compete offering lowest fees by handling offchain transactions (risky but cheaper for everyone). 
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:10:04
NEVER! DON'T MAKE A BIG MISTAKE
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:43:35
True, also tought about it. Once the altcoin bubble bursts there will be some big wins and a lots of loses.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:47:42
they can buy whatever they want, WE decide what software to run 
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:07:32
Miners spamming the network and collecting higher fees every time there is a buying spree 
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:05:51
The BU strategy:
1. Buy altcoins
2. Spread FUD
3. Destroy BTC value
4. Fork and attack
5. Use altcoins to pump BTU

I would be very much interested on knowing your position on UASF

exchanges are getting a small taste on how to deal with bitcoin forks. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:26:21
IT'S A NATURAL PROPERTY OF BITCOIN

your bitcoin is very well invested where it is, don´t play around and lose it
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:15:32
Thanks to Chandler for sharing his thoughts. Energy companies becoming bitcoin mining business is quite big. Bitcoin continues to be the best store of value (energy). 
About to see the impact of Moore's Law in bitcoin mining.

we will be able to buy coffee with litecoin sooner 
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:32:54
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:12:26
maybe there is another clever way to circumvent the miners
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:08:49
any candidates for the substitution?
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:57:36
Why not?
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:45:26
it's noncounterfeitable, divisible, transportable, durable, censorship resistant and has the smartest people working for it
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:27:43
I think that the author should have made clear that the first million mined bitcoins haven't been touched
@_date: 2016-09-30 19:34:21
there is: the need, economic flexibility, growing technological literacy, flourishing economy, huge diaspora among others. I wonder if there is a constant growing amount of businesses accepting it.

 -- using a Ledger
 -- using electrum wallet
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:22:22
The reference client is bitcoin core if you want to be part of the network and enforce the rules/
If you want to store and hold go for a cold storage device like Trezor or Ledger. 
For a hot wallet try GreenAddress, Jaxx, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:26:35
more volatility, many people trying to manipulate the price. Moon still in sight! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:11:40
BTC can be sent from a legacy address to a segwit address and viceversa without problems. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:39:20
Holy crap! This guy knows what he is talking about
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:28:59
still early, consider next halving is in 2020 
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:14:59
take a look at the video from darkestchaos, he summarizes the report  
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:24:04
"That´s one small step for bitcoin, one giant leap for mankind." 
@_date: 2016-10-29 17:42:12

thanks a lot Luke! I think it was worth the effort in spite of the communication difficulties and the noisy area
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:05:54
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:09:03
great stuff, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:05:14
there will be volatility, segwit will prevail and at some point before the end of the year, Jihan will have to decide to fork or not to fork (I don't think he will decide to fork). 2018 might be the year of massive adoption
