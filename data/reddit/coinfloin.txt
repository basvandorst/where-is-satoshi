If all stocks go to zero, you technically still have access to your bank balance...
But, such a financial shit storm, has huge ripples reaching more than we can imagine...
All go to zero only happen in a weird new reality, nobody can predict how we got there, or what happens there.
So technically yes, in reality it all depends on why all reached 0...

LN is not like a light switch which suddenly can turn on.
It is like going to IPv6, all type actors need to adopt and use the technology to work.
Such processes are more years than days.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:55:50
And what if used as a in-between-solution?
Scale blocksize until LN is ready, could have been a smoother transition....

You need to educate yourself on the basics.
Wallets certainly generate many adresses, all with new private keys. If this sounds weird, read and ask in the beginner sub.

I agree that it is important to allow normal PC's to run full nodes,
But from 1 MB to 2 MB, won't suddenly require a 20k server. 
The trend is indeed a step into that direction, but if the steps stay small enough, we might be able to walk along with the average PC.
Segwit2X, for me, is a nice compromise. I hope it shows the benefits of 2 scaling technology, and hopefully show not a decrease in full nodes.

Guys, if a small group is people is sticking to the Original Satoshi paper, and try keep it pure, why would you act so negatively towards it?

If you perceive a clash or fight, between 2 camps, and feed it with oil, all you do is harming both sides.
Trolls are plenty, and if you base your view on them, we all not benefit...
I can understand at some point naive blocksize increase can be problematic. This linear strategy will halt at some point. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:10:50
For some subjects, the process to get to your solution is equally important as the solution itself.
There is not a side I feel strongly attached to.
I try to observe the bitcoin as a whole, and not be too tunnel visioned by copying others and stay at that side.
The whole fragmentation I see as a part of bitcoin itself.

You can't choose a address.
You can choose (but better randomly generate) a private key. 
From the private key, 1 single unique address is generated, with a unpredictable process.

So, exchange some BTC for LTC?
Isn't that a bit like opening a lightning channel?
Why use BTC in first place than, there are alts that doesn't have scaling issues or have flexibile blocksize?

Where did he tattooed the private key?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:22:16
Each private key, belongs to 1 unique address.
All BTC on that address, can only be moved with help of private key.
The calculations of BTC say so, and you can't change them.
If you want another private key, you need also another address.
If you feel unsure about who might have your private keys, move your BTC to a new address.
A new address where you created the new private keys in a clean environment.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:43:53
Isn't this just sticking to the agreement?

Make sure it is actually holding BTC! At moment you use it, it should become $, not at moment of reloading.

The blocksize &amp; efficiency, should be at least big enough, for all people in the world, to make 1 transaction a year.
We can argue over side-chains, bigger blocks, and more, but 1 person, 1 transactions a year, is my minimum. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:07:41
In short, because you are not bounded by the fees of bitcoin transactions.
It is completely up to you and payment provider.

It is a part of bitcoin.
Everyone can fork, run nodes and implementations they wish to run.
Everybody can decide how to use it.
And if you disagree, don't consider it "clean" or "fair" usage, well, too bad.
Don't go tell people that they shouldn't use it that way, or that others attack the 1 and only pure bitcoin.
There shouldn't be the 1 and only, bitcoin is bitcoin, with the big mess around it too! Learn to love it, otherwise you will only frustrate yourself.

@_date: 2017-09-29 08:05:14
You are comparing a centralized versus a de-centralized system...
You can't have the benefit of both, without the downsides...
At some point, you have to either accept it is truly de-centralized, -or- be more happy with a central authority.
Bitcoin is messy, but you have to learn to love it.
Be critical on yourself in what direction you want it to go. People can use the artifacts of the de-centralized mess, to push their agenda.
If you are against miners to have complete freedom do to as they please, are you really a bitcoin lover?

He better take a position as keen observer and reporter on this matter...
Any degree he diverts from being neutral, he would lose a equal amount of credibility.
From the small amounts I have seen from him, his view on bitcoin is more holistic, where discussions/disagreements like this are part of her ecosystem.
Persons like that are rare, let's not lurk him to 1 side or the other.

Thank you for clearing this up. What is your source of information?
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:42:30
We can discuss all details and implications, and scenarios.
At the end, after enough time has passed, a clear main fork has been identified. 
XAPO is choosing that fork, without taking a political side in big block versus small.
Simple as that. And logic from XAPO position. Expect more similar companies to act like that.

If you are against a HF, you are for a 1 MB for eternity.
That has huge implications, about scaling, even when the LN most optimistic theories hold.
Quite an extreme stand point.
I have difficulty to believe this is your believe. 
If so, confirm so, and please put your view on what you think the scaling implications are. Because that is where the discussion should start.

Indeed, XAPO cannot. They have to be boring and stable.

For a desktop: 1 mistake, in any of the applications running, and all your data is in danger.
Smartphone: built in protection of applications data on higher OS level, where in normal circumstances applications cannot mingle with. 
I feel safe with an updated smartphone, not jail broken. No bullshit applications. 
My feeling is that smartphone is 2 steps away from the safety of a hardware wallet, but 4 steps more practical.
Thats is a feeling, based on a coffee and a cookie, so be careful absorbing my fake wisdom.
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:43:18
Seems safe!
Yes, on most well implemented app, you control them. 
Taken out rubbishy fake coins stealing apps, which unfortunately exist.
A backup phrase, usually 12 words, will internally be converted to several private keys with associated addresses.
The app is doing this for you. If you control the 12 words, you control the private keys.
Same like a hardware wallet is asking you to backup a phrase. 
A safe way to store coins, could be to delete the app after writing down the 12 words. This is something i do a lot, and consider to be a practical paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:46:58
Don’t boot the drives.
Take them out of the PC’s, and scan them from a other PC with NTFS (or other) recovery utilities.
Simple booting might already throw away informations/bitcoins.
After having a clean dump, create a backup, and start forensic/hacking on that.
Do this all with PC’s disconnected from the Internet.

So much trouble....

@_date: 2017-07-28 11:21:20
A desktop PC is a malware magnet.
Don't use desktop pc (mac/win/linux) to store private keys (encrypted or obfuscated).
A simple iPhone is saver.
If you want a paper wallet, delete the app after convincing yourself with tests you are able to recover from a recovery phrase.
This is about as safe as a paper wallet, but much more practical, and less error prone.
The goal of the attacker was to get your coins without getting caught.
He most likely did his best erasing all evidence, and don't expect you find artifacts, or root cause.
