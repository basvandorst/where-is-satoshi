Yes thanks, I had read it:
 "... *no one exactly knows what happens to a currency that grows continually more valuable.*"
hence my question.

Don't sorry. Reddit is full of unpleasant people.

Thanks very much for your time answering. Many interesting ideas in your comment. Mmm... how do you see the transition to actual fiat to new currencies backed by bitcoin? I mean, if bitcoin gain confidence and more and more people choose it to store their savings, the remaining cash in circulation of usd for example, will it be enough to keep it uhm alive or it will crash?
If it were to be maintained, and even then, coins backed by bitcoin would emerge... would they be seen as preferable or unnecessary?

I agree on your first point, something like when our grandfathers make 5k per year while we make like 40k, but in the opposite direction.  Will people be fine with our savings gaining more value overtime at cost earning less instead?
I can't hardly magine a world with a currency that it's also for store value and everyday currency. Hence, your second point, where you point a "goverment" that must rule over currencies for different uses. Doesn't it goes against the essence of untrusted/decentraliced/autoruled?
edit: grammar

Very much appreciatted your thoughts. Merged government crypto, wild crypto and fiat is a very interesting perspective. First notice for me about England plans. Seems will be not so easy "to exit" the system like Andreas states in this [talk]( as national banks makes their moves.

But what if I buy some in the dip and keep it sleeping for my brother one or two years ahead? It would be a nice wedding gift to cash it then. What do you think?
