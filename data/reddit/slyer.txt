There are other factors especially while the space grows rapidly but that's the overall principal. Given a double in the price of Bitcoin you would expect to see a doubling in hash rate, eventually, all else equal.
When the block reward halves in the next few years, expect to see a near halving of the hash rate.

Basically, blockchain.info runs a web-based wallet that runs fully in your browser, not on their servers. When you log in to the site, you are downloading your encrypted wallet that only you can unlock with a password.
Think of them being a bank with a safety deposit box where they can look after the box but only you have the key to access the contents. Also you can make a copy of the box so even if they disappear you can still recover your Bitcoin.

Yeah it's all about psychology and expectations really. One example that springs to mind is cars with CVT. On paper and in practice its a better solution from an engineering point of view, but many drivers didn't like the feel of it due to the lack of gear changes.

Coinbase buys their bitcoin and sells their bitcoin on an exchange.
The basics of exchanges is that there are buyers and there are sellers. The current price is where those two intersect.
Say there are 6 people trading. 3 that want to buy and 3 that want to sell but they all have different ideas of how much it's worth. They put the amount they are willing to pay or sell for on the exchange order book.
* Person A wants to buy 1BTC for $400 max
* Person B wants to buy 1BTC for $500 max
* Person C wants to buy 1BTC for $600 max
* Person D wants to sell 1BTC for $600 minimum
* Person E wants to sell 1BTC for $700 minimum
* Person F wants to sell 1BTC for $800 minimum
The exchange will see that Person C and Person D match up so it will take person C's dollars and person D's Bitcoin and exchange them. This is what establishes the price of bitcoin and anything else that is traded.
Take a look at the bitstamp order book to see this in practice: 
Hope this makes sense!

The reasons for the average person to want to use it are still coming, it takes time for these services to be built and trusted. In many cases the fact that bitcoin is used will be hidden in the background and won't even be visible to the end users, they'll just see dollars or euros.
First it will be easy, instant and cheap overseas payments.
Second it will be in order to get a discount. Merchants will want people to use bitcoin as they get instant payouts, low/no fees and no risk of chargebacks.
And third but most important is that in the coming years people will use bitcoin in order to have a safe place to hold savings. Large scale currency inflation, bail-ins, seizures and straight up currency collapses will play a huge part of Bitcoin adoption in the years to come. There are very good reasons why Bitcoin is becoming so popular in Argentina. The people there understand and sometime soon the rest of the world shall as well.

That's an interesting question.
It seems to me that if the value of Bitcoin doubled overnight then we would also expect the value of the shares to eventually halve to keep it at the same euro-denominated value.
However, a strong Bitcoin is very good for NeoBee as it means the market for NeoBee services will grow. NeoBee also holds a lot of Bitcoin reserves which will increase in value, making the company more valuable at the same time. If customers have their deposits denominated in Euros then all of the potential gain from an increase in the price of Bitcoin will go directly to NeoBee.

Not a bad plan! They have a very interesting economic system. I believe they have an employed economist to help manage the economy with money faucets and sinks like in this podcast.
The way they allow people to use real money to buy things is with the use of PLEX which is basically player time. $20 buys you a month of game time, but you can sell that game time to other players within the game!
So PLEX have a market price within the game in terms of ISK (eve money). It's valuable because people want it to keep playing and many people play EVE without spending any dollars because they create enough value in game to trade for PLEX.

This is what I tell people concerned about scalability. Bitcoin will serve as the decentralised backbone to all the decentralised and centralised services built on it. Off-chain transactions may play a large part in the future, but these centralised systems will have compete against the blockchain in terms of costs, security and privacy. If the blockchain fees become too high people will move their transactions off-chain and the reverse is also true. This is the beauty of a market based system.
Even if bitcoin never went above 7 transactions per second that would still be doable, it would just serve a different purpose, much like central banks do now.

You are indeed a victim of a completely broken banking system. The US fed is keeping interest rates artificially low and creating inflation through QE.
As a comparison, I'll explain how banking currently works in New Zealand where I live. The NZ central bank is keeping its interest rates at 2.50% and is actually looking to increase them soon thanks to good figures. No quantitative easing money printing. Contrast this with the US's 0.25% rate and 85 billion created by the fed every month.
Savings accounts here return about 2-3% per year, you can get 4%+ if you keep the money in a term deposit. I get charged zero fees for my checking account, ATM withdrawals are free, bank transfers are free and we use EFTPOS payments at retail stores which has no fee other than the monthly flat fee the merchant pays.
Here is my bank for example:

This question is important and comes back to what Bitcoin was originally created for in the first place. It wasn't designed to replace other payment systems, it was designed to replace or supplement existing currencies and replace or supplement central banks.
The solution in the mid term once this becomes an actual issue is to increase the block size to allow more transactions, but I don't see this working long term unless computing and networking capabilities truly do keep growing. Maybe they will? We'll see, but below is my prediction.
As the upper limit of transactions per second is reached, fees for bitcoin transactions will continue to rise until it's high enough to push everyday transactions to off-chain ledgers and to side-chains. Coinbase to Coinbase transactions for example are all off-chain, payments move within their own ledger. Side-chains may arise that use the bitcoin currency but all the transactions will happen off to the side, outside of the main Bitcoin blockchain.
What I see in the future is that Bitcoin becomes the rock solid, decentralised network that acts as the backbone of numerous side chains as well as off-chain transactions. It will deal with large savings accounts, company holdings, bank deposits, loan reserves etc but wouldn't typically be used for day to day purchases. The other important fact is that it CAN still be used for day to day transactions, so these side chains and off-chain ledgers will need to be cheap enough and reliable enough to compete with bitcoin itself. I think this is a beautiful thing.

Bitcoin wasn't created to save you 2% on your online transactions, it's about cutting out central banks that constantly debase our currencies and opting out of the banking system that has been fucking us since the invention of paper money because of their legal privilege. 
Bitcoin about freedom, in this regard it has already succeeded. Once the next global financial crisis hits, bitcoin will be ready and waiting as a way to opt out. Satoshi built it for this reason. Just see the message embedded in the genesis block:

That's just one of the features of Bitcoin but not the most important one.
The most important features are fixed supply and decentralisation. It prevents a forever expanding supply of currency through fractional reserve lending and cuts out central banks entirely.

Well, money wasn't invented in the sense of "Hey, lets find something that has all the best qualities for trading and all agree to use it as a medium of exchange to improve efficiency."
Early trade was barter, goods for other goods. Beef for wheat, corn for gold etc. Gold was valuable because it was shiny and rare, people wanted it for those properties first and foremost. People started using it as an intermediary because they knew it would hold its value and not spoil etc. It was only when it got to the stage that precious metals like gold became widely accepted as payment that gold became what we would now call money.

Simple. The price of bitcoin goes down, suddenly it becomes unprofitable for some the miners to continue mining so they stop mining. This results in a lower hash rate (thus longer block times) so that next time the difficulty is calculated it is decreased to shorten the block time down to approximately 10 minutes again.

Bitcoin itself is very resilient. Goxcoins and vicurexcoins however are not. So long as you make sure you actually hold bitcoin, you're fine.
Even if fractional reserve lending did happen to a large extent, you're still capped to a large degree as you can't create new bitcoin to lend out and then use that bitcoin as reserve an infinite amount of times like you can with dollars.
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:53:20
Unfortunately there is no other distribution method possible for a pure POS coin like NXT. Having a slow distribution requires mining which compromises the entire idea of NXT which is to avoid mining entirely. This lack of mining makes attacks very difficult.

Maybe you get it so many times on here because your reasoning is wrong.
Pricing the loan in dollars had the exact effect I explained in each of your three examples, it removes the risk of bitcoin's volatility. Which is not an uncommon desire, look at all the bitpay etc merchants converting into dollars instantly. They're using bitcoin the payment mechanism and etc while holding any savings in it. 
Assuming that the borrower pays back the loan, the lender is up 10% no matter what the bitcoin price does. The other advantage to the lender is that if everyone believes the value of bitcoin is going to go up, there will be very little demand for loans in the first place. As people don't want to have to pay back much more than they borrowed in the first place.
Conclusion: it removes the volatility of using bitcoin if you are interested in lending but not interested in currency speculation.

Hows how I see it. Bitcoin will be for savings accounts and like a gold backing for checking accounts. Most of the day to day stuff will be done off the chain for little or no fee with providers like coinbase.
What makes this better than what we currently have is that the off-chain providers still have to compete with the original block chain, this keeps them in check.

The loan is issued in terms of dollars. So if you loan $1000 of bitcoin out you'll get $1100 of bitcoin back. It means you're still up $100 no matter what the bitcoin price is.
It should be obvious why this is an attractive option for those who don't wish to speculate in bitcoin or are already speculating enough.

That's an interesting question.
It seems to me that if the value of Bitcoin doubled overnight then we would also expect the value of the shares to eventually halve to keep it at the same euro-denominated value. 
However, a strong Bitcoin is very good for NeoBee as it means the market for NeoBee services will grow. NeoBee also holds a lot of Bitcoin reserves which will increase in value, making the company more valuable at the same time. If customers have their deposits denominated in Euros then all of the potential gain from an increase in the price of Bitcoin will go directly to NeoBee.

Doesn't necessarily need to be 1 share = 1 satoshi. That would be quite an inefficient way of doing it, it would mean that if you wanted to trade a million shares you'd need a million transactions, each with a miners fee.
Rather, the satoshi would represent a block of shares, the satoshi could be labelled as 1000 Microsoft shares or 1 billion Microsoft shares.

Doesn't really matter what you spend it on. It's still going to hold all the values that libertarians extol. Again:
* Fixed supply, as opposed to permanent inflation.
* Stateless issuance, as opposed to central banks and analogous institutions.
* No centralized control, as opposed to central control by governments.
* Strictly voluntary adoption and use, as opposed to edicts forcing people to use it.
These qualities aren't going to go away, you would have to create a different cryptocurrency. But then it wouldn't be Bitcoin.

Why would there be a bank run if the bank was well funded? Bank runs happen to failing banks, and failing banks are the opposite of well funded.
My position is to leave it up to the banks as to what their policies are. Leave the central banks out of it. Depositors can evaluate the risk vs interest rates when signing up. Different reserve requirements decided by the banks themselves, there may even be a market for full reserve deposits. 
Of course, Bitcoin solves all of these problems.

Nobody is saying it is a freebie. They're saying it's a form of hidden taxation.
You could expand the currency supply by 20% or you could take 20% of everyone's savings and only in the second circumstance does everyone shit themselves. Both are forms of taxation, but people don't understand inflation.

Anarcho-capitalism is a system where all trade is voluntary so you can spend it on the things that you value, not what somebody else does.
Trade is where both parties exchange goods/services because they think they are going to be better off than without the trade. If you need to take money from people in order to spend it on things, then that means the person doesn't value what you are spending it on.

Sigh. A currency is something that is used as a medium of exchange. People trade things for gold not just because they want gold, but because someone else will take the gold in exchange for something different that they want. Gold is both a currency and a commodity. Gold is scarce, divisible, fungible, easily recognisable etc which makes it a great currency in the form of coins or gold backed bank notes.

You would have the same pricing problem with any new currency or even existing currencies that are rapidly changing in value. The bigger it gets the more resistant it becomes. If bitcoin took over the world, it would be a complete non-issue. For now, there's no problem with pricing things in other currencies.
Also, bitcoin isn't just a transfer medium it's also a store of value.

You've replied to my comment rather than the post itself but I do have some things to say. 
Why do you say that it is critical that it have a floor? As long as bitcoins are useful as a method of exchange they will have value.
The important thing to look at here is whether they have a supply "ceiling". Bitcoin, gold and silver fit this category as they are unchangably limited in supply. Every fiat currency runs the same risk of becoming worthless through hyperinflation. Just look at weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, Argentina and many other places. This hyperinflation happened not because the currency suddenly became worthless on its own, but because the money supply had expanded so much that each currency unit became worth less and less. 
The scarcity of Bitcoins, silver and gold is what keeps them valuable. However, Bitcoin has many advantages over precious metals in that is free or near free to store and transfer, infinitely divisible, impossible to counterfeit, can cross borders without issue and cannot be seized.
But yes, I won't be blowing all my saving on Bitcoin, it's good to diversify. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:17:05
I think their rampant inflation probably has a lot to do with that.
@_date: 2013-09-25 23:22:28

As long as it's small and relatively consistent it doesn't matter really. The point is to stop the boom and busts caused by rapid expansions of the money supply. Low interest rates cause people to borrow much more than they otherwise would, rapidly expanding the money supply. Preventing the rapid expansions prevents the inevitable contraction. See the Austrian business cycle.

"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node." - Satoshi

Well here's a good summary of [quantitative easing.](
Expanding the money supply decreases the value of the money in your wallet and in your bank account because the more of the currency there is, the less each unit is worth. In effect they are taking away your purchasing power, so the contents of you wallet and bank account buys less. The same effect as if they took some from you. It takes time for the money to work through the system however, so prices take a while to reach the new levels so it often goes unnoticed.
Bitcoin is actually experiencing high levels of supply inflation at the moment but this will decrease rapidly over the coming years, and everyone knows what they are getting into. 10% per year at the moment IIRC. It's also being offset because of high demand for the currency which is why bitcoin has tended to buy more over time.

Hyperinflation is a very real threat and it has wiped out many national currencies in the past when they had very high levels of debt as well as a large deficit. The exact circumstances America finds itself in at the moment.
As soon as interest rates rise to counter the inflation they are already seeing, the interest burden on the debt will be massive and the fed will have to resort to huge amounts of money printing to pay it off. And then it compounds and compounds till the currency is worthless.
Hyperinflation is part of what caused the rise of Hitler. Germany suffered hyperinflation trying to pay off the reparations from ww2 and royally fucked them. Some blamed the bankers. The Jewish bankers.

Firstly, why is the economy slow in the first place? Is it caused by a bust following a boom?
Secondly, savings shouldn't be considered as just sitting on money. They've saving in case of emergency so that they don't have to take out an emergency loan and have to pay interest. People aren't planning on never touching the money, they save so that they can spend later and that's the crucial point.
The best solution is to avoid the boom/bust cycle entirely so that consumer confidence is maintained and you avoid all the bad investments during a boom.

Currently the monetary base of Bitcoin is rapidly expanding from mining and at the same time we are seeing massive deflation of prices due to lots of people buying into it.
A bitcoin bank can never loan out more bitcoins than it actually has, it can impact prices yes but it's capacity to do so is very limited compared to what can happen under fractional reserve banking.

That wouldn't really work, tying it to gold doesn't fix the problem. If Bitcoin doubled in value over the term of the loan and the borrower paid back the principle in terms of gold etc, the lender would only get back half as many bitcoins as when they started.

Your complaints about Bitcoin businesses are fair, many of them are very new companies but there are plenty of reputable ones that have established themselves prominently as well. This is not a flaw of Bitcoin remember, it's only because the bitcoin economy is new, these things take time.

As to the hoarding point, Let's consider two situations. 
A) there are 10 million bitcoins in the economy
B) there are 12 million bitcoins in the economy,and one person is completely hoarding 2 million bitcoins.
Both situations give the same effect of having an effective 10 million bitcoins in the economy as long as the bitcoins continue to be hoarded.
Its not until these bitcoins enter the market that they actually have any effect on prices. When there are more bitcoins chasing the same goods, prices in bitcoins will go up.
What this means is that hoarding is not a problem, so calm your tits. The economy will keep on functioning on whatever portion is left.

Im well aware of the foibles of fractional reserve lending. If it were up to me, there would be no deposit insurance and no bailouts. Banks get into this mess primarily because of all the bad loans they give out. Loans that only happened because they knew they would be bailed out.

New Zealander here. First of all, New Zealand has a strong, stable and well-capitalised banking system with plenty of liquidity. Our currency is stable and our central bank is sensible. We are staying well away from the currency debasement wars that the other big countries are fighting. 
When a bank is failing, they have lost some of their depositors money. The big question is who pays the price for it? Their customers or taxpayers? Personally I say the customers. Why should everyone else have to front the cost when it was the depositors choice? 
When banks are allowed to fail, banks will stop giving out loans to bad borrowers. If you could give out loans to anyone with the government guaranteeing to bail you out if you need it, why wouldn't you start sending out preapproved credit cards in the mail? 
The government needs to get out of bed with the big banks and the problems will fix themselves. This video describes my thoughts:

There wouldn't just be one army, there will be many defense organisations. Because these defense organisations are private, they have to keep their customers happy otherwise they will withdraw their money.
Imagine if you could withdraw you tax dollars from the US army if you didn't think they were serving America's interests, that gives you real power. But of course, they force you to pay it with jail or guns if necessary.

How are you so dense? Nowhere did he say that bitcoins can't be loaned. I've got 5BTC invested on BTCJam myself. 
He's saying that Bitcoins can't be created out of thin air like regular fiat currency can. When a loan is made under the fractional reserve banking system, new money is created. He was saying that a video of this process would hardly have the same effect as there is nothing physically being created when this happens.

You'd be nuts to want a loan in Bitcoin. If the price doubles for example you'd end up having to pay back double.
Loans in Bitcoin will be feasible once the price has been stable for a long period of time. 
Better to get the loan in dollars for now and buy bitcoins if you need them. That way if the price of Bitcoin increases your loan burden will lessen. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:01:29

According to [here](
**Single Pass** - By default all wallets are stored by AES encrypting the entire JSON payload with the users password which is then encoded as base64. No salt is used for single pass encryption. The exact AES specifications are 10 rounds of PBKDF2, Block Mode CBC ISO10126 padding.

@_date: 2013-01-02 11:29:19
I assume you mean like interest bearing savings accounts?
Not really as of yet, it makes a lot more sense for people to want loans in dollars as the dollar value is decreasing so you don't have to pay back as much, bitcoins are increasing in value so you'd have to work even harder to pay back the principle.
I think we'll start seeing loans and interest bearing accounts etc once the increase in value levels off and there are enough things to buy in bitcoin to warrant getting a loan.
As for when a company will start selling shares in bitcoins? Who knows.

We could start by getting corporations to pay their taxes.  As I mentioned above, corporate profit margins have hit an all time high, and that money will circulate far faster if it’s placed in the hands of consumers.
Except, no corporations ultimately pay the costs of the taxes, it just gets passed on to consumers and workers. Think about it.
Imagine you had no corporate tax, and then all of sudden you started taxing companies at 30%. One or more (possibly all) of these things are going to happen:
1. Prices are going to increase by up to 30% to make up the difference
1. Costs are going to be cut by reducing the size/quality of their products/services
1. Their workers are going to take a paycut
1. Shareholders are going to pull their money out and take invest it somewhere else or take it overseas
1. Companies will find a way around the tax
So what I'm saying is that consumers pay the tax, not the companies. Might as well be honest about it and call it a sales tax.

There can still be fractional reserves but the amount this can happen is capped and nobody is forced to put their money into a fractional reserve bank like they are now.

It lacks all the baseless assumptions that Keynesian economics have. Keynesians think they have enough information to centrally plan economies, whereas their track record shows that they have no idea what they are doing. Their models can't explain why the boom and bust business cycles happen, but it makes perfect sense when you understand the Austrian business cycle.
Austrian Economics is based on human action. Humans act to satisfy their most urgent wants, these wants are based on their own subjective valuations of goods and services. The biggest claim they make is that we don't know enough to centrally plan an economy, the free market is the best system for efficient allocation of resources.

Libertarianism is a political philosophy of freedom in the economy and freedom in our social lives, not just a political party.
Some see running for the Republican party as the best means to achieve those ends, making them a small "l" libertarian.
Personally I think voting for freedom achieves little and I would rather develop the means to freedom in my life outside of politics. That's why I love Bitcoin.

No, the problem was that it's harder to decrease wages than it is to decrease prices. I believe there were laws and labour unions etc that didn't allow wages to decrease as well. This ultimately ended with people losing their jobs rather than having their wages decreased as a result.

It's seems like many of you aren't sure how the metric system works in most of the world. The main unit of something is called what it is. Litres, metres, grams etc. Then 1000 of those is a kilo like Kilometre or kilograms. But you can just say "kilos", you don't have to say grams because we know that from context.
Millilitres, millimetres and milligrams are all know as "mill". 15mg is 15 mill. 25ml is 25 mill. 70mm is 70 mill. 
This is intuitive and it's used that way every day. Bitcoin can be used in the same way. 1 Bitcoin or 1000 millibitcoins or 1000 mBTC or 1000 "mills". 
You already use this for the dollar. Cent is short for centidollar.

You would only make a loan without interest as a charitable thing, I've loaned money to people with no interest as well. But this only makes sense on a very small scale, between family and friends for a short period. 
What if I wanted to start a company? Build a house? Not many are going to have the full value of a house sitting in their savings account, less still are going to be ok with it taking 20 years to get their money back. 
Without interest on loans, the amount of money available would be seriously limited as a lot of people will just sit on their money rather than putting it to work benefiting others. Students can't always save up all the money for university, and people wouldn't be able to afford houses if they had to pay for it all at once.

Totally false. The computing power of all the miners could half or double tomorrow, bitcoins would still be released at the same predetermined rate of 25 BTC every 10 minutes.
Bitcoin's value comes from it's scarcity. Its scarcity comes from the mathematics of the system which dictates how quickly bitcoins will be released.

First of all, that is an insane amount of deflation going on, deflation at that level could indeed be disastrous. But you wouldn't expect anything like that from a fixed currency except in the case of rapid increases in value from people buying it up while fleeing the other currencies. For simplicity, lets assume that the entire world uses bitcoin, then this becomes a non-factor. Lets also assume that the newer iPhone takes the same amount of materials and labour to construct, people just want it badly because it has a new shape or sticker on it. The real change would look something like this perhaps: 
Year | Good | Price | Price | Price
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
2012 | iPhone 5 | 599 | | 
2013 | iPhone 5 | 400 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 580 |
2014 | iPhone 5 | 300 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 390 |
 | iPhone 7 | | | 560
The previous gen iPhones become cheaper they are outdated and the newer iPhones are slightly cheaper because of an increase in the value of Bitcoins. There are the same amount of Bitcoins chasing more goods in the world thanks to growth, so we get about bout 3% price deflation.
The point here is that it wouldn't be all that different from the way it is now, people will still want an iPhone and only some would be willing to go a year without it just to save $200.
Businesses will continue to innovate in order to keep ahead of the competition. Consumers may save more money than they do with an inflationary currency, but only to a point. The only reason you save is so that you can spend at a later date, the money will be spent eventually. And they're not just going to leave it sitting around either, they can grow their savings by investing it which helps create new growth and technology.

I'm not worried about this really, the software will improve in the future. And even if it doesn't, there's always off-chain transactions. For example, if I have my spending account with coinbase.com and I spend my money at merchants that accept through coinbase, you don't pay any fees.

"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node." - Satoshi

We can call it a favour if you like, when I say charity I mean giving without any expectation of getting anything back for it. When you give someone $10,000 that they have to pay back, you aren't giving them the money as such but you are advancing them the use of money that they would otherwise have to save up for. The favour or charity is in that they can use the money now instead of in a years time. If you could use the money that you will have saved in a years time, you could just borrow from your future self! The cost of loaning this money out to you is that you don't have it to spend on anything, you could have spent it on something you wanted or invested it to watch it grow. In summary the borrower gets money early, the lender loses access to the money until later. That's the favour/charity.
People with savings want to watch them grow, they can do this by loaning money at interest or by directly investing the money into new business ventures.
The amount of money in the economy is the exact opposite of set! In fact it is rapidly increasing at the moment. The federal reserve is creating $85 billion every month to "stimulate demand" and every time someone takes out a loan, new money is created that affects prices. Currently the federal reserve is forcing interest rates down, meaning that people take out more and more loans that they otherwise wouldn't have without the interest. This is one of the more exciting parts of Bitcoin as the money increase is controlled and will taper off to nearly nothing in a decade, but a separate topic.
Check out the first half at least of the first link, it explains the view! The banks provide an extremely valuable service to society by protecting savings, filtering out bad borrowers and increasing the wealth of everyone in society. At least, that's how they should run...

The supply part is the number of bit coins available for purchase, not the total bitcoins in existence. If few want to sell, you have low supply and the price goes up. The price going up means more people will want to sell etcetera etcetera. It balances itself out.

I think a combination of removing the max block size and off-chain transactions will do the trick.

At the very most it's as possible as it is with gold which is still capped around a certain point, this is a much less-bad version of fractional reserve lending. The current runaway credit expansion we are seeing with fiat currencies is impossible.
If word got out that Coinbase was only holding fractional reserves for its depositors, these bitcoins would no longer be bitcoins but more like bitcoin-backed coinbase bucks. And it would only be possible to trade them within its own payment network.

Quite a few :
No fees. The transaction does not need to go through the Blockchain, and isn't subject to a 0.0005 BTC fee.
Instant - the transaction confirms instantly.
No double spending risk.
Anonymity - the transaction is not broadcasted and recorded in the Blockchain


If you send to a bitcoin address that is actually an Inputs.io user, we'll process the transaction off the chain, meaning you get all the benefits without paying any fees.

You can update figures in your database all you like, it will never create a new bitcoin. Banks cannot loan out bitcoins that they do not have.
New money isn't just a statistic, it's an inflation in the money supply which leads to an inflation in prices. If too much new money is being created, prices increase too fast - that's why the central bank uses their interest rates to try to put a brake on excessive inflation.
Nowhere did anyone say that bitcoins weren't loanable.
