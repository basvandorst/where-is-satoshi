Bitcoin isnt even 10 years old. Lehman Brothers was over 150. Do you think people holding their stock said it cant go to 0?

Yes but you dont know which crypto will win and if the bubble pops you cant just assume it will go down like the dotcom bubble. There are many bubbles that never recovered and maybe none of todays cryptos make it.
