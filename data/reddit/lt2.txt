And this kind of guillibility is exactly why regulation is needed. Because our economy would collapse from all the unchecked stupidity without it.

This site is a scam to get you to bet on things that take several months to complete so they can day trade with the funds. Its a real ponzi and I advise staying away from it. 
Watch the blockchain.

You are delusional.

No you are wrong. Deregulation in the financial system allows for greed to be unchecked. Which simply doens't work because as we have seen it hurts the entire market and that manes everyone gets fucked.

Don't put your money on this site!
They make especially long bets (IE ones that will take more then 6 months) so they can take your money and day trade with it or sell it.

Not really, because unregulated markets lead to a monopoly and mtgox has the monopoly on bitcoin exchange with real liquidity. The rest are just reacting to what happens on mtgox.

Yay for unregulated marktes, where this guy can scam a bunch of people. Then use that money to further screw everyone else by manipulating the economy with his stolen funds.

Nope not that hard, you just have to say libertarianism is retarded and short sighted to a group libertarians. It is really easy.
