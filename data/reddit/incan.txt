Hopefully. Seems to be a lot of pitfalls in the Japanese language. I'm far from an expert :) might be a context thing.

my biggest concern is that my wallet has been compromised, i keep the rest off wallet, but how can i know if the wallet is unsecure, wouldnt the transaction have more transaction ID if it was a theft?
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:21:42
incan 
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:01:58
It's the latest, 0.8.6
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:27:02
if so, why shouldn't the wallet show it as a outgoing transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:47:23
Edit, only my address in there, the other ones are unknown

Lily Allen turned down the bitcoin-gig worth millions
Today repent artist: "Idiot"
She was offered 610 million kronor.
But Lily Allen turned down - because it would be paid in bitcoins.

Just over five years ago was offered Lily Allen, 28, to do a gig where she would get plenty of SCREW. But the pop star turned down - after a bit of confusion surrounding the currency.
- Someone asked if I could stream the gig live on "Second Life" for hundreds, thousands of bitcoins in payment. "As if," I said. Idiot. Idiot, she writes on Twitter, according to the Daily Mail.
Allen, who is said to be good for just over 60 million, turned down the gig. A gig with today bitcoinvalue was worth SEK 610 million. Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009, whose main purpose is to make payments over the internet without a third party, such as a bank.

Thanks for the info, will be transferring to NORDEA, the 1% fee and 20NOK doesn't bother me, just read that they will start taxing it as income and we all know what that means. I don't even wanna look at the trekktabell for bitcoins. 
Isn't it possible to withdraw USD and have the bank exchange it into Euro or NOK ?
Assuming you transferred in EURO to the bank and then the bank converted euro-&gt;nok and changed a fee for the exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:23:38
Noone would, that's why. 
They never specified that it was BTC, could just as well be mBTC
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:15:25
Fantastic, I'll see what I decide to do about the tax rates. Feels like the Norwegian tax-office is more or less guessing how much one should pay/get paid. 
The process of converting usd -&gt; euro, did you simply sell btc and bought em back in euro?
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:11:41
midnight? Europe here and it's almost lunchtime!
Welcome back :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:23:28
What bank are you with, DNB, SB1 or Nordea?
Did they tax you anything for it? 
Trying to get some more info about withdrawing funds to Norwegian bank account 
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:48:11
Some context might be good..
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:32:38
Turns out you were right, im a bit worried that it can be manipulated fairly "easy" in comparison to other currencies, its the community that builds it, and as long as we stay together, nothing will go wron :)

i explain the supply and demand and compare it to trading animals/anything that does not have a set monetary value.
In the end its the supply/demand that decides the price of it all
