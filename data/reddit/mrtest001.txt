This is a non-event.  Nobody is going to pay with BTC when it has a huge fee attached to using it.  My guess is anyone who does use BTC is really trying to prove a point and not because its actually convenient or makes business sense.

I generally agree with you.  But if you are going to talk to noobs it would be dishonest to not let them know about the fee issues with BTC.  Yes, I can tell people about this awesome credit card they can sign up for, but if I omit there is a $30 fee for every transaction, you are gonna end up pissing a lot of people off.

The blocksize debate is over as of Aug. 1.  Those who are ok with 1MB blocks use the BTC coin, those who want bigger blocks use the BCH coin.  There is no more discussion about BTC going beyond 1MB.  We need to see the "small block" experiment run to its conclusion.

How about you buy some bitcoin cash instead?  This is not a religious war, these are investments.  Either BTC will be worth a hundred K or BCH will be.  Why not hedge your bets?  Lets face it BTC with its high fees is less useful for purchasing stuff and BCH is more useful.  BTC is a safer coin because it has more hashrate, and BCH is less safe.  They both have strengths and weaknesses.  Invest in both and stop trying to destroy one.  Let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:39:45
What's the scam?
I would say had there been a large pre-mine after the fork (eg. Bitcoin Gold) that would have raised a lot of flags.
BCH is a cryptocurrency that works exactly as bitcoin did (except with larger blocks) - it forked and is being bought and sold in the marketplace.  Where is the scam?
If you thing Roger or Jihan are satan, well, when I buy BCH I don't see their names anywhere and I don't write checks made out to them - its not THEIR coin.
I don't see what the scam is...
A scam is basically a fork with no value add - but even that its just a bad coin, not a scam.  
After years of two sides arguing with small vs larger blocks, you honestly don't think the world could use a coin that is almost identical to BTC except with larger blocks?  That is what 'agreeing to disagree' means.
What is the scam?  That you don't like the personalities?  Roger and Jihan can win the lottery tomorrow and retire, and it wouldn't affect the fact that BCH can fit all the transactions in a single block and the fees are low.  I don't recall making a BTC transaction for less than $30 in the last few months so I only move BTC so I can sell it.  I still have half my BTC, but I also diversified into other coins that seem to work better as a currency.

BTC has large fees because people bid for a spot for their transaction.  There are a lot of transactions and not enough spots, so the bids are high.  BTC seems to be being positioned as a 'store of value' instead of something that is meant to be transacted.  So perhaps if you want to own BTC, you should let it sit in Coinbase.
Or you can do as some have suggested, wait for a full moon on a thursday and time a transaction to be sent between 3PM and 6PM on the  following Saturday (assuming not a leap-year).  People don't seem to understand how currency is supposed to work.

Holy mother of Jesus - where have you been getting your information?
1) A dispute has absolutely nothing to do with when you open or close a payment channel.  You close a payment channel to settle your tabs on the BTC blockchain.  LN has a much weaker security model than BTC, but I dont think any merchants will try to rob you of your coffee purchase.  But once the amount gets a bit substantial, you (and the merchants) will want to settle and lock it up on the actual blockchain.  If the fees continue to be as high as they are now, you are looking at least $10 to do this settlement.  And you have to do another on-chain transaction to open a new payment channel.
2) You are correct there are no fees until you close (but the LN operators have to make money somehow, but i dont know how they collect it.
3) When you open or close a payment channel that requires an on-chain transaction, there is going to be a fee.  There is no such thing as 'reopen again for free'.  On chain transactions mean you have to pay miners.  Period.
4) I do not see what LN being adopted will affect on-chain transaction fees.  Yes, if you want to buy coffee now with BTC it will cost you $20, and with LN it will cost you $0 - so yes in that sense.  But on chain transactions will continue to be extremely high as long as people are bidding for the limited block space.

Giving out your RECEIVE ADDRESS is safe.  Ideally you want each address to be involved in 2 transactions maximum.  One transaction that gives it bitcoins, and one transaction that empties it.
But if you are getting bitcoins from multiple people, that is still ok.
But you should not be sending bitcoins from an address more than once.  I believe the first time you send bitcoins from your address, the public key is visible in the transaction.

Where you using a windows machine? I personally would NEVER use a windows machine to do anything Bitcoin related.
I used a Live Ubuntu setup to do something similar.
But here is what will really get you.  You have to be paranoid when working with private keys.  Did you copy the key correctly? Will it be legible 6 months from now?  How do you verify?  How do you keep a backup of your wallet?  The more backups you have the more chances you are going to lose track of one, and someone else gets it. If you encrypt your wallet, what if you lose your password? Now you have to keep track of that....it frankly never ends.
Doing this stuff with 100% certainty is draining on you mentally, physically...and you can never be 100% sure.  Eventually you WILL make a mistake and pay the price.
Just get a Trezor and don't think about it again.
Keep your 24 word seed (which even if you misspell to some degree, is still perfectly fine) and keep your hardware wallet to use - even on infected computers!!

I think the perception is that Core believes that full blocks is good for bitcoin as it raises fees for miners.  That's why BU does not like this kind of idea.  They don't believe that Core wants to work to getting bigger blocks.

Because Bitcoin was not invented so miners can make money.  Mining is supposed to be a marginally profitable enterprise.  If fees are high, users are inconvenienced and may choose to use other means to transfer value.  Without users, there is no Bitcoin.

So if Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin using LN, can she then double-spend by giving Mary 1 btc using an onblockchain transaction?  Lets say Alice only has 1 bitcoin to her name.

What I don't understand is that most people (I would guess &gt;95%) believe 1MB size is too small, yet there is still so much resistance to raising this limit.  Even with Lightning, you still need blocks bigger than 8MB (someday) to handle more user adoption.  Do the math.  As a LN user, how often do you need to replenish and settle your accoutn?  For most people that's every pay check or every two weeks.  So every bitcoin user needs 26 transactions a year on-chain.  How many users can 1mb support at 3 tx per second? or even with segwit's, say 8 tx per second?
The answer is far far below the moon.
Now if Core had agree to raise the size to 2mb a year ago, can you imagine where we would be right now as a community?

I voted 'less than 10 cents', but if the blocksize was large enough, you could go to 'less than 1 cent' and the miners would still be able to operate.  Being a miner should be a marginally profitable operation.

BU community is not against 2nd layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:23:12
To your reference that nodes enforce rules - well, when the 1MB limit is hard-coded, nodes are not controlling anything.  If 100 different nodes want a hundred different sizes, I do not think it is reasonable to ask them to change the code and re-compile and deploy.
So the BU mechanism allows miners to converge on blocksize limits, but I think what you want is a mechanism for nodes to do that as well.  I would respond to that by saying that switch your node to a mining node and now you have a vote in the blocksize using BU's mechanism.  
I do not understand why any entity in the bitcoin protocol should think to have a vote if it is not doing the PoW.  
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:41:57

@_date: 2017-03-18 01:57:20
You need both.  To support thousands of txs per second you need ungodly sized blocks - so I don't see that happening.  But LN also requires some number of on-chain transactions.  Even if you settle once every 2 months (and most people will probably settle at least 2 times a month at least) That still limits that maximum LN users to something like 20 million people.  Far too few for the moon.

I understand what you are saying now.  I am convinced that users running a full node have a vital role in keeping the miners honest.  The number of miners in this space is relatively few and them colluding when billions are at stake is not far-fetched.
Given that we need users to validate, does that absolutely have to include even the users with a very weak connection who can't afford a hundred dollars in storage?
Not sure how many miners there are, maybe hundreds?  However, I would guess there are millions of users around the world with good network infrastructure, and a few hundred dollars to afford an 8TB drive that can validate an 8MB bitcoin network if they wanted to - for years to come.  
Surely potentially millions of validating user nodes is enough...if not, how many is good enough?
I would say that having a billion users who want to run a full node but cannot is OK as long as there are millions that want to and can.  
And if the syncing of 8TB network from scratch would take weeks,  well, you know how clever people can be.  I am sure we will get services that mail you preloaded harddrives - or you will be able to buy preloaded drives on amazon...and 10 other solutions that I can't think of.
However, if we want to say that eventually we will reach limits that cannot be overcome - I cannot argue this, because yes, eventually with enough time there will not be enough storage on this planet to hold an ever growing blockchain - but this is true with a 200 byte blocksize as well...

@_date: 2017-08-27 21:04:02
I truly appreciate your response and I would really like to understand more where you and others concerned with block size are coming from.  
I read the link in your comment.
So your view is the reason big blocks are bad is because they make it hard or impossible for everyone to run a full node.  and the reason users need to run a full node is outlined in the link in the comment.
That's what I am hearing.
This issue is so nuanced and complex that having a hard-line stance in any corner is not the right approach IMHO.
It is not a given that users should run full nodes - so that is debatable.
Even if the above is given, then whether EVERY user should is also debatable.
Even if the above is given, whether having 8MB blocks precludes users is also debatable.
There just too many ifs.
I agree, with 8MB blocks, not every user who wants to run a node will be able to.  
But if I were to debate one point - it might be the need for non-mining nodes to validate.  There is always a path from a miner to another miner (this path can either be direct, or through user nodes that agree with miners) - they can bypass user nodes that dont agree with them - so what can user nodes really do? Specially if all miners agree to change a rule, I am pretty sure they can update their peer list to send blocks directly to other mining nodes.  
Now, get some mining nodes in the mix who disagree with the rules and you can see how this affects consensus.

1) Invest what you can afford to lose.  BTC going to $100 should not bother you.
2) Never discuss numbers online - no one should know how much money you have invested, or how many bitcoins you have.  
3) If you pay for BTC does not mean you OWN BTC - you don't own anything until you control the private keys.  So say you use Coinbase to buy and just leave it there - well, they might get hacked or close shop and you will be completely out of luck.
4) Since you seem to be new to this, controlling your own private keys is almost guaranteed disaster - get a hardware wallet (I recommend Trezor or KeepKey).
5) I also recommend starting slow - buy 1 BTC every couple of weeks until you get comfortable with it.
I have been learning about BTC myself intensely for the last few months.  I am also a computer guy and KNOW what its like to lose passwords, have hardware break on you.  And what I have learned is that NEVER trust your memory or your ability to randomize or your ability not to make a mistake.  Count on EVERYTHING that can possibly go wrong eventually going wrong...
Sorry did not want to rant...but I have learned a lot so feel free to ask any questions or review my history for the questions I have asked of others in this subreddit.

@_date: 2017-01-30 00:02:28
I understand your enthusiasm, but it is good to be cautious at the same time.  At 3 transactions per second, BTC can"t handle the lunch crowd at a moderately populated university campus.  Nothing better has come along in 10 years it seems, but something better could appear tomorrow and drive bitcoin to the ground over night.  
And be careful about getting stuck in an echo chamber where all you hear is how great bitcoin is.  
Having said that, I would be disappointed if bitcoin does not reach $1,300 by end of 2017.   Satisfied if it reaches $2,000 and amazed if it exceeds $3,000.

I was stating that there are millions of users in the world who can run a node if they wanted to.  They have access to high-speed internet and have funds to buy, say, an 8TB drive.  
My question was - isn't this enough validation?  
If the answer is no, we need 100's of millions or billions of user nodes, then yes - we need to make sure that someone running on a 100Kbps internet can validate nodes (I am sure there many parts of the world where 100Kbps is considered luxury).
My opinion is that it's ok if not everyone on poor networks is validating, because we have at least millions of people who do have high-speed that can handle the task.

You should at least sound neutral and professional.  I hope that the reason for your stance is from a level-headed technical perspective.  Calling it 'bcash' tells me there is more politics and emotion involved in the decision than engineering.  And realize that Bitcoin Hash holders also hold Bitcoin - so your potential customer base is not just vested in one crypto currency.

Mr. Tone said Bitcoin Cash would die within 3 hours of the fork.  Best not take what this man has to say too seriously.
Nobody is perfect.  But when I speak of bitcoin and somone asks 'do you think XYZ', the very first thing that I say is, 'I do not know and no one can know for sure - but from what I understand....'
Mr. Tone speaks with such authority and confidence as if he is a time-traveler from the future.  Given that he was wrong to such a magnitude, he needs to take time and figure out why he went wrong...why is he so confident...what can he do better.....and speak with more humility...but does he care?

Please answer honestly to yourself: if Bitcoin had been invented in 1995 and had 1 KB blocks, do you think you would be saying the same thing about the dangers of going to 4 or 8 KB blocks and Bitcoin thriving longer term thru to 2015 and beyond?

I would definitely use bitcoin to buy stuff, if in the next browser window I could buy bitcoin back immediately.  The price is going up so fast that by waiting 2 weeks for your paycheck to buy more bitcoin, you lost money.  Also the transaction fees and backlog is not helping either.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:16:50
I didn't mean neutral, probably should have said 'unbiased'?  And I am referring to businesses not individuals.
Most businesses (who want to maximize their customer base), usually go out of their way to sound unbiased and professional.
The same thing happened with Trezor.  When they used 'bcash' and the Bitcoin Cash community pointed it out, and Trezor still wouldn't budge - well, I lost faith in them (I have 4 trezors - 2 still unopened).  You think I am going to trust my Bitcoin Cash to a company that could potentially have an agenda against it?? Hells No! 
They lost a loyal customer (probably more than a few) - why do that as a business?  You work hard to keep and gain a reputation, and lose it over a label?
Trezor is great for Bitcoin - but I discovered Nano Ledger S for their fantastic Bitcoin Cash support - now I use them for everything.  For all I know, the president of Ledger could hate Bitcoin Cash more than anyone, but they didn't let that get in the way of professionalism and their product (AFAIK).

You get a Trezor exactly beause you don't want to be technically savvy.  You can even stop being paranoid to some extent since a virus and malware can't get to your keys.

Aren't you kind of on a slippery slope? You are saying if blocksizes keep doubling and doubling and doubling...etc. we are not gonna be able to handle that - so might as well stick with small safe blocks.
You are correct - if we had 64MB blocks today, that would certainly be a problem for many people. 
But with with 8MB full blocks, that's 8x144x365=410GB a year. I simply do not understand your train of logic.  An $80 2TB HD is good for 4 years.
and with 128KB/s connection you can download 4TB of data a year...

I would say do not rush out and take your coins out of Coinbase (or whereever) without knowing how BTC works.  Yes, not having control of your coins is NOT viable long-term.  But if you rush out and do something without fully understanding BTC, you might end up being the cause of your loss.  If you do poor practices it is extremely easy to lose your BTC.  I just bought a Trezor should have it in a few days...this might be the best option of all.

Thanks for the response.  It's just a decision derived from technical merit carries more weight (with me at least) and has a better chance of convincing others (I would hope).  Just saying calling it 'bcash' gets you absolutely nothing...it preaches to the choire and signals others that you are 'just angry' at the 'other coin'.  Its childish name calling.

To be honest, in a technical sense POW definition is a very good one.  On top of that, what really matters is what the public calls it.  You can be some smart guy in a room who knows the 'truth' as to which chain is bitcoin, and you could be 100% correct - but if the world is not playing along, its pointless.
Ultimately bitcoin is which ever chain the public decides is bitcoin.  Of course having the most POW would convince most people.

Just as it would have been impossible to believe using my 2400 baud modem in 1994 that one day I would be watching HD movies online, I have a feeling we might be getting our network speeds up a factor of 10+ before bitcoin goes to 10K TPS.  But also you might be able to buy storage drives that are preloaded with the bitcoin blockchain.

Thank you! If I may double-dip and ask you another question.  When I did spend the 0.001, I noticed another transaction with a 0.07978397... I assumed this must be related to the 'change transaction' but change for what? I have 10 BTC in that wallet - where did the number 0.0797.. come from??
When I go to my wallet I see that I have the correct amount I expect.
But when I use a block chain explorer and look at the specific address, I see that the 0.0797 is missing - so I am 99% positive this is related to the 'change transaction'.
Thanks again.
Oh wait...as I am typing this I think I answered my question.  I noticed months ago I had deposited 0.0797... in my wallet, so even though I see my amount as 10BTC, it is actually fragmented across many wallets already and one of those was 0.0797...  and it took the 0.001 from THAT wallet...

Core would't even give 2MB until LN is ready?  This is beyond belief.  Think about how many millions of merchant dollars have gone to fees while we wait for LN.
And since you already know that LN takes multiple transactions per channel to operate - how many people will LN support with 4MB segwit blocks?
The answer is definitely not bigger than 10 million.
So to go to any serious scale, Bitcoin would eventually need to go beyond even 4MB segwit blocks - so why aren't they doing it now just to appease all the angry bitcoin users.  
This is like running a popular restaurant with 4 chairs - and the focus is on getting more servers to take and deliver food faster.

Thanks for the write-up.  I do appreciate the effort you put into it.
There is something thought that I am confused about.
Regarding 
If Segwit was a soft-fork, it means that an un-upgraded node can still accept a block with segwit transactions in it.  How would an un-upgraded node know to look for the signature to validate them, if they are not where they are expected?  So do un-upgraded nodes verify the transaction without witnessing the signature? If no, then how do un-upgraded nodes know to look at the end of the block to find those segregated witnesses?
And if the answer is, that there are no un-upgraded nodes, that would not give me the warm fuzzies.

To be an angry bitcoin user does not need collusion, coordination, or attending a "big blocks" rally, nor anything else.  All it takes to be an angry bitcoin user is to try and use bitcoin.  I have used bitcoin 5 times in last 48 hours to convert to BCH and it has cost me close to $40 in fees.  I only hold BTC because the tide might turn and I cannot predict that, but if it wasn't for pure speculation, I would dump all my BTC.  I cannot afford to use BTC as a currency - so why hold any?
As store of value? As soon as news breaks that someone lost $100K in BCH due to lack of security - I will use BTC as my store of value - guaranteed!

Currently miners are spending $11 million a day securing bitcoin.  If everyone is storing their bitcoin as value, and the reward subsidies halve every 4 years, who is paying the miners?
I think I know, its going to be YOU when you take your coins out and have to pay $500 transaction fees.
And if you think bitcoin is going to be worth a million by then, this is where we can agree to disagree.  I rebalanced 20% of my BTC for BCH because I realize that all those pizza joins and restaurants and shops that take bitcoin, are just basically pointless.  Nobody is going to pay a $10 service fee for Bitcoin when Litecoin and BCH are around - or even a Credit Card.
I agree that if you are going to send $10,000 to Turkey, Bitcoin rocks!  But that's not my use case.  I want to spend bitcoin and I cannot - so I am re-balancing it towards the coin I believe can be spent.
I am not a fanatic to dump all my BTC - I am not that naive.  But I am watching which way the tides go, and I believe BTC is in for real hurt if it does not become usable currency.

No amount of detailed instructions will help educate a non-technical person.
If a person is not technical they will most likely lose the coins within minutes of trying to move them.  
They will take pictures of the passphrase with their smart phone, send them to a cousin asking them if they know how to use that..
They will set the wallet unit bits when they meant mbits and over pay by a factor of 10x.
They will miscount the 0's and lose.
What you should do is give them each a hardware wallet with $20 of BCH and have them use that thing 3 times a week  until they get how to use it.  Have them recover their Hardware wallet after reseting it using the passphrases.  
I say BCH because if they are going to make dozens of transactions to learn, best not have it cost $2 a pop.
My dad insisted on keeping the 0.1 BTC that he has on his own wallet - I kid you not, he lost the hardware wallet within 90 minutes.  We finally found it after 2 days of searching.

Thanks for your nice comment.  I am curious however, why you think 1MB size is good for bitcoin.  Even with LN, with 1MB you won't be able to scale to the levels we want.
If you believe 2MB will lead to centralization - do you believe the 2MB itself will - or that we are on the path...and will actually get there when blocksize is perhaps 32MB....
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:12:10
The only issue with Bitcoin right now is the high fees.  And high fees is not just a phrase - I started in bitcoin where 80 sats per byte was usually less than 30 cents.  With bitcoin's price to where it is now, 80 sats per byte is expensive!  No I will not use Segwit, No I will not put a fee of 15 cents and then wait 6 hours hoping it goes through.

You've heard the phrase, "Perfect is the worst enemy of Good".  To me its relevant because Bitcoin is being destroyed because of the perception of a non-existing problem.  If the 'idea' of 1GB blocks scares us (as it should) that is not a reason why 2MB has been held back for years while fees rack up.  
I rebalanced 18% of my BTC to BCH in august, and I rebalanced 20% more two days ago.  This is basically 90% of my savings and I take it very seriously.  
Crypto has been very good to me since I started with Bitcoin in 2016. 
However, with the hope reducing fees gone, I see Bitcoin as useless for transactions due to the high fees.  
If it wasn't for FOMO, I would have converted 100% of my BTC.  Why would I hold a coin that I can't use? - or rather don't have to use because there are better options.
I am also dabbling with helping a restaurant start taking crypto currencies, and please tell me if you think Bitcoin is a realistic option for that - I am recommending Bitcoin Cash.  And since the whitepaper says its a peer-to-peer system, unless I see real problems - I want to see real peer-to-peer transactions.  Not going through a CC company that converts to BTC in the background.

The scaling debate has been raging on for years, and I hear about layer 3 just yesterday! Really!?
The problem is quite simple - its high fees.  I will not pay $5 when I can pay $0.03.  If L2 was here today and the fees were low, Bitcoin would be heading to the moon.
The problem is L2 is not here, and the only thing which gives immediate relief is not on the table - that's a bad combination.
I think you would see the problem with fees if you transacted with bitcoin a handful of times per week.
I am not here to convince you...the market price of the competition says it all.

I learned about cryptocurrencies through Bitcoin...it was the first coin I bought and it has been very good decision financially so far.
But let me ask you a question - if you wanted to use bitcoin right now, could you?  The fees - the backlog.  It really is a yes/no question for me.  If the answer is "No - but thats because...." it really doesn't matter why.  A coin has to be resilient and work as intended.
If however, you believe bitcoin was not meant to be spent but be a store of value (digital gold) are you not worried that the whitepaper's title page calls it a 'peer to peer digital cash system' and that you are using bitcoin for something other than what it was designed for?
What I am trying to say is I want the world to get a hold of the coin that bitcoin promised - I believe in that revolution.  And when I read things that are contrary to that goal, I simply cannot support it.  I don't care the coin is called 'bitcoin' - it is an unusable digital curiosity in its current form.  Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin and in my opinion aligns much more to the digital currency we were promised by the whitepaper.  
I simply don't want to see anyone lose their investment.

BTC is not ready but its competitors are.  And we are not talking about small tx for a few hundred million people.  I don't believe BTC will even fill out 4MB blocks yet - however, if it does and we see problems why wouldn't everyone rally and reduce blocksize?  Problem is that we are being told that big blocks will kill but there is no evidence for that at all.  There is no data.  And I am talking about 2MB....not 500MB.

Dr. Peter Rizun described how a 'Segwit Coin' is fundamentally not a Bitcoin because the whitepaper described bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures.  Segwit breaks that.  Now I don't fully understand that, and that is the point - I wont use something that I dont understand.  
I think Segwit adds overhead and friction for all future adoptions and support because of its complexity.  And I don't blame companies for not putting extra resources to try to support it when Segwit still takes 4MB of data to transfer 4MB of data.  The only clever thing about Segwit is that it fooled clients through some mental gymnastics that the 4MB they received is really 1MB.  This is madness.  I don't want this much complexity in a currency.  Complexity leads to bugs in implementation / exploits.
If we had zero other options, I would be knee deep in segwit - but in a world of competition, there are better options.  BCH gives 8MB of space for 8MB - simply.  I am sold -  but we can absolutely agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:43:51
Yup....When you are not using Bitcoin, it doesn't use any Bitcoin bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:24:54
Again, you are absolutely right.  The place where I disagree with bitcoin's direction is that the 'cup of coffee chain' is still 18 months away....and the blocks are full today.  We are not going to get to even 8MB full blocks before L2 is ready...so give us big blocks until L2 is ready.
The fact that we are stuck on 1MB whereas even 2MB is puny - is very suspicious of the real motivations behind it.  There is absolutely no excuse for not being on 2MB two years ago.  Even LN will require much much larger than 4MB segwit blocks to scale.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:57:52
I can tell you what its not.


Before Bitcoin solved decentralized consensus, I am sure there were schemes to count IP addresses, count users, etc.  But all these fail because of sibyl attacks. 
Anyone saying that consensus can be achieved by counting clients on nodes or counting nodes or any other variation that does not involve pow, is living pre-Bitcoin era.
What is bitcoin? I don't have time to get into all that - it's in the whitepaper.  But I was just pointing out what it's not.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:51:55
Bitcoin having a $210 trillion market cap? You know the amount of money in the entire world is $80 trillion, right? 
Also in 14 years!?? They can invent pills to cure all cancer and it would take more than 14 years to get world wide adoption.
I would say you need to dial down your expectations of bitcoin by about a factor of 100.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:17:33
Yes, I used to afford 1BTC with every paycheck...now I can afford 0.1BTC per paycheck...So yes, I have fewer satoshies...and the 80 sats/byte that used to cost me 30 cents to buy, now cost me $5 to buy.  What's hard to understand about that?
Your point would be valid if I was getting paid in Bitcoin at a constant rate.  So even if the dollar amount of bitcoin 10x'd it wouldn't affect me, cause my paycheck is still the same number of satoshies.

What is my slippery slope fallacy in this case.  When you have 8MB blocks it will up 2TB of space in 4.7 years - that's just math.
And if you double the block size, you are doubling the storage requirements.
And now a 4TB will last you another 4.7 years - we are still not in the 'datacenter' realm.
I do not quite understand what the slippery slope fallacy is here.
Claiming we can't go to 2MB because if we do, then 500MB is around the corner is the slippery slope.
Any solution that can practically work for the next 10 years is a good solution.  Even 8MB blocks can be handled with today's tech for the next 10 years.
I agree that at 200MB blocks, very few will be able to afford the tech today.  (today is the keyword)  But we don't know what the next 10 years will bring in tech.  However, the trend will be that in 10 years, you will have 8TB USB 5 sticks.

I don't understand the best store of value argument.  What makes bitcoin secure is hashrate (according to the whitepaper).  So if you have 2 coins where they act the same given the same hashrate, but one is useful for transactions (because it is a fraction of the cost) Why wouldn't the market demand the one with the extra functionality and hence have hashrate follow the market?

I may suggest a definition of success of bitcoin is when a billion people are using it.  Even with Lightning you will need much bigger blocks to accomodate a billion (or even a 100 million) people who might need 2 on-chain transactions a month to settle.
No matter what solution you believe in, a large user-base of bitcoin will need a blocksize much bigger than 1MB.
I do not understand the resistance to raise the blocksize and the move on to more robust scaling solutions.

I do not know the technical details.  But it looks like it's an optimization on the POW algorithm.  It's not breaking the protocol.
I don't understand how this is a bad thing or a hack.  
If tomorrow someone figures out that you don't have to check numbers that end in 4, I wouldn't call that a hack either.
This would be a hack if they figured by sending a certain series of bits, it would exploit a bug in clients to accept invalid POW as valid.  Now THAT is a hack.

Something I absolute hate is that I can't mine bitcoin on my pc because others have gained a huge advantage using $3,000 ASICS.  I wouldn't categorize that as cheating or hacking either.
If a client written to bitcoin specs accepts a POW, then the POW is legit.  You really can't cheat - unless you are exploiting a bug in clients.
If Bitmain hired a super-natural oracle that can find a POW in a second - that is not cheating either IMO.
If Bitmain or somebody else has huge shares of hasing power, the way to combat that is to get more hashing power yourself - that is how bitcoin works.
As an aside - I fully advocate changing the POW algorithm of bitcoin so anyone with a PC can mine bitcoins.

I don't understand what you mean by blocking.  My understanding is that when 95% of miners agree then segwit will activate.  well, 95% of miners don't agree yet, that doesn't mean segwit is being blocked.  it means that segwit has not sold itself as a good idea yet to 95% of miners.
To me, blocking means that 95% of miners want segwit, but they are being blocked from having it by somebody.  This is not what is happening.  
Can I open up a mrtest001 coffee shop and if I don't get 95% market share - complain that my business is being blocked from succeeding?

You dont have to know which coins are lost and which are not.  In fact there is no difference between a lost coin and a hodl who is not selling.
What matters is that someone wants to buy 0.1 BTC and who is selling NOW and at what price.
It is possible that the owner of lost coin was willing to sell at $3,900 but now the next lowest price is $4,000.
Lost coins are special because their selling price is essentially infinity.

Gold can sit at the bottom of the ocean for a thousand years and it will still be gold.

I agree with you.  Anything that can automatically meet the financial transaction needs of hundreds of millions or even billions of people is a good thing.  But not if before the L2s are here, and the blocks are chocking, and usability is shot, and growth stops, and the community divides and we get 3 forks!!!  
If bitcoin had added 1MB to the blocksize a year or two ago, we would have ONE chain, ONE community, and a $10K coin by now.
I agree we do not need to keep every coffee purchase on the blockchain forever, but when there are no L2 solutions, and the backlog is anything but 0 bytes - I am ok with bigger blocks.
Do you know that if we increase the blocksize, and its a complete disaster that we can lower it again?

Even with LN you need &gt; 1MB blocks so 1MB is going bye bye. If Core devs would rather quit (cuz no one can get fired from open source project) than deal with a hard forked coin...that's on them. And bitcoin will need a hard fork after losing 90% hash rate. These are not the times to be dogmatic. Good luck

I think the problem is the two camps are talking past each other. Its like arguing which is more important for humans - oxygen or water.
If there are tons of miners on a coin that nobody is using, then that coin is worthless.  On the flip-side, no one will use a (pow) coin that has no miners.  You need BOTH users and miners and its a chicken-egg problem - cause they both depend and attract each other.  This is not simple stuff - its a dynamic self-influencing system.

Yes, getting the fees when you own your own equipment is a big plus.  Plus no doubt there will be periods when it's more profitable to mine than others - and you can turn your machine on and off whenever you like.  My contract is cancelled if it unprofitable for 30 days straight.
At the same time if you buy $30K worth of machines for 100TH/s...you still looking at a couple of years before mining a block (if my math is right).
And $30K of BTC today might be well over $150K in a couple of years - and your solved block in a couple of years might be after the halving - so yes, its complicated.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:39:28
I bought a contract for 3 BTC (was worth $7,000 at the time) around may.  It makes a solid $35 average per day.  So even though I will have made my $7,000 no problem (in a couple more months), it doesn't look like I will ever go beyond the 3 BTC.  I am currently sitting on 1.8 BTC return which by today's rate is more than $7K, but I would have been better of holding the 3 BTC.  
Theoretically, say it makes me $35 / day for 10,000 days - that's $350K dollars.  But guess what, it may still not be able to buy 3 BTC (which might be worth a million in 10,000 days).
Bottom line is that i starting mining at 0.015BTC/day...but that number is decreasing (even though the $ amount is constant).
I will break even when I make my 3 BTC - but that seems unlikely.
I knew going in that there is no such as free lunch - but at least now I would recommend to folks to just buy and hold.  Stay away from mining.

And there it is.  Some people see there is no room on the block so they want to increase it.  Others see the blocks as just fine.  This argument has been going on for years.  So after being stuck with a 1.6 KB/Sec Bitcoin network - we are going to see how the 3.2 KB/Sec pans out.
I side with bigger blocks because the small block arguments simply do not make sense.  Small blockers want to rely on Layer 2 solutions - Perfect! BUT even with Lightning, and Segwit's 4MB blocks - we are NO WHERE close to being able to handle even 1 transaction per month for a hundred million people.  Even with Lightining we need much much bigger blocks.
Nobody has yet explained to me if 4MB blocks will kill the network, then how on earth you plan to scale Bitcoin to even 1 billion people.  It just wont happen even with L2 solutions and 4MB small blocks.
And Bitcoin to me means being able to handle being a world currency.  And being able to transaction with less than 10 cents fees.  And having that transaction confirm within 2 blocks.  And I will support any fork that has these features.  Heck if you can do that with 300KB blocks, sign me up.

All I've heard from the current guard is 
a) Segwit everything
b) Even 1MB is bad for Bitcoin, 2MB is the end!!
c) LN is going to fix everything
I disagree with every single one of these bullet-points.  
And in the meantime I see a huge backlog and big fees.  So I was not in the backroom deal - but I agree with it.  Nothing else is being done with Bitcoin and instead of going out and grabbing new users and new use-cases, we are bleeding out use-cases.  And we can't keep hearing "wait wait wait..we need more testing" - dude Bitcoin has been sitting around for 2 years!!

@_date: 2017-10-15 23:08:45
I think this is one of the main points where folks do not see eye to eye.  You do not see an imperative need, whereas I see the backlog as a problem that should have been solved last year.  
The mempool needs to be nearly empty on average and fees need to be low as well (a few cents).
We have neither of those today and that is hampering adoption.
Getting and keeping users should be the  priority - and currently bitcoin is not growing as fast as it could be had it had better capacity.
I do believe L2 is critical and I do not think it is necessary to have every coffee purchase on the chain - but a 1MB limit is laughably small (so is 2MB TBH).
But nothing either of us say is going to change anything - and we can safely agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:30:30
Thanks for the explanation, but there are a couple of plot holes still.  
a) We got Segwit. Period.  SX1 and SX2 both have Segwith so the asicboost ship has sailed.  I do not see how asicboost plays any role in the support for SX2.
b) Miners fearing that LN will eat their fees seems legit - I mean wouldn't you worry if something was going to take money out of your pocket?  And since miners were mentioned in the white paper and LN was not, I will side with the miners getting the fees on this one.
c) Bitcoin is open source.  And at any point one or more implementations are (and should) be running.  Core's version is one.  How is Core getting fired?  Anyone is free to run Core's code.  What I have heard is some Core devs saying they will quit bitcoin - well that is their right.  Core devs do not have commit rights to btc1 repo, and neither do btc1 devs have commit rights to core repo - that is normal, right?  Each repo has their own set of devs and anyone is free to run whatever code they want - I do not see a problem.

The setup that Bitfinex has is complete bullshit - therefore, the current price you see is not at all representative of reality.

I would use Coinbase - yes there is a fee, but there is a fee because it is worth it.  Sure you use GDAX and pay no fees, but you type in an asking price with an extra "0" somewhere, and you just bought yourself a $60K bitcoin.  
Also, for god's sake don't do anything with 125K at once.  Do it in chunks - I am paranoid so I would probably do that in 20 chunks.
Good luck.
Also you should tell them to educate themselves - they will be taken for a ride if they keep asking others to help them with bitcoin.  And if they can't understand it, tell them not to invest.

When 95% of hashrate seems to want it - it will happen.  I dont think its necessary or possible to get 100% agreement.  
If we had gotten 2MB blocks a year or two ago - there would be no splits, no Bitcoin Cash, and $10K prices by now.
I am completely baffled why we didn't go to 2MB blocks back then.  Even with Lightning, 1MB blocks is not nearly enough because you still need onchain transactions with LN.  Even with LN, 8MB blocks will not be enough to handle Visa level loads - each person will minmally need a handful of onchain transactions to settle every month.

You can't fire people from an open source project who are not on your payroll.

Of course you understand that the premise of bitcoin is that miners are 'rational profit seeking agents' ie. "greedy".  In this context, greed is what keeps the system going.  
Agreed. ASICS are a "pain in the ass" - but that doesn't make them centralized or monopolies.  Centralized would be if bitmain stopped selling the asics except to his friends...not you can't have it delivered in 2 days via amazon.

I am too scared to use transactions where old nodes do not see my signatures.  And I do not understand Segwit enough to not be scared.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:54:05
how can bitcoin be 'taken over' ? its an open source project built on cryptography and proof of work.  How does one take over such a thing?
Well if you call convincing 88% of hashrate to follow a chain a 'hostile' take-over, I don't know what a non-hostile take over looks like.  Because you cannot get 100% of people to agree that water is wet.

People are trying to stop a measly 2MB blocksize and have torn bitcoin into 3 coins and stopped innovation in its track.  And what I keep hearing about is the slippery slope of 1GB and 1PB blocks.  There is a reason why slippery slope is called a 'logical fallacy'.  
My dude, 2MB or 4MB or 8MB is NOT 1GB and its not 1PB.
Yes, with 500MB blocks we would stop many in 3rd world countries from running full-nodes (I am assuming running full-nodes is top on their list after drinking water and toilets).

The community tried to get consensus with the blocksize debate for years.
At this point it doesnt matter to me who decided to make the change - its that the right change is being made in my opinion.  
So if my choice is that we get bigger blocks because of mustache twirling CEO's or we stay with small blocks and wait for consensus while Bitcoin dominance falls lower and lower - I'll take bigger blocks.
Bitcoin needed bigger blocks even before last year. (and keep in mind 2MB should still be considered small blocks).

How does GPU mining help with decentralization? You would still have 1/10th of one-millionth of the hashrate.  Sure the total hashrate will drop by an order of magnitude or two, but relatively speaking, you are still making the same.  
And also not all GPUs are created equal, eventually it will come out that a particular model from a particular manufacturer is the most efficient - and THAT model now becomes the bottleneck - oh and what do you know, it will probably be manufactured in China!
The guys with 100 million $ ASICS will now be the guys with 100 million $ GPUs.
Its true that as a hobby or "something to try out", it is MUCH easier to use a GPU - almost anyone can have something up and running within a few hours.  But anyone who is serious at all will invest a few thousand to get the right equipment - exactly as they would with asic mining.
When bitcoin was young, anyone with a gpu can come and be a miner, but the market has matured - and even with gpu pow, you need some serious investment to mine if you want to be called a 'miner'.

My  reason I do not have faith in the Core developers (despite their competence) is their absolute conviction to the 1MB blocksize.  And before you mention Segwit's size accounting - I am referring to non-segwit transactions.  Is that 1.3MB or 1.7MB with Segwit? Regardless I am looking at the bicoin blocks and I am not seeing any blocks close to 1.3MB...

The tokens being 13% could be telling of Segwit2X values or Bitfinex's reputation.  I get the feeling that S2 supporters will end up getting shafted (regardless of S2's fitness) if they get involved in the contract that Bitfinex setup.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:14:34
[I am not sure why we are not seeing them]( 
But not sure how that plays out when older nodes can still accept the blocks.  'Something' is still limited to 1MB if older nodes can still accept even 4MB full segwit blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:53:36
You are correct. This is the nature of not having replay protection.  Since s2x is not expected to be the minority chain, it does not need protection.  Bch expected to be minority all along hence the protection.  S1 and s2, one hopefully dies quickly.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:49:58
It might also be that miners (and/or users) want 2MB blocks.  I realize segwit gave us 4MB - but that's only if you use segwit txs.

Can you give a specific example? I don't understand what 'same bitcoin' means.
Each address has a btc amount associated with it.  
I think a specific example would help.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:46:31
Even with 2nd layer you still need to settle on chain - say once a month (like most people pay their cc bills).  A 1MB block won"t be able to handle 15 million users who want to use btc on a regular basis - even with L2.

So you are saying that you did not change your phone number, and you did not change your phone, and that now you are not getting the code sent to your phone for the 2 step verification?
And this is happening at login...
Have you ever logged in before with 2-step verification?
Because on some forms you actually have to press a button to have them send you the sms.
Or they have a 'send again' button - press that.
Maybe test your sms 2step verification using a different service like GMAIL to see if it works there.
Next veryify that coinbase is using the right number. perhaps by clicking on 'forgot password' and maybe they will show u the last 4 digits of the phone.  But don't actually go through with it because it might invalidate your password as well.
1) validate that your phone is working by tesint 2-step auth with something like gmail
2) validate that coinbase is using the right number
3) make sure there isn't button you need to actually press to have coinbase send the code.

Reading the cannonical answer [here]( really makes you appreciate how basically it is impossible to ask the question.
Perhaps one should ask 'What is the maximum number of transactions that can fit in a segwit block?'

Unless we are in another 2013-like spike, where BTC might go all the way up to $8,000 then crash to $1,000 - it looks like BTC will continue gaining value - so waiting is a bad thing.
Also consider nobody can see the future.
So I recommend you buy once a week, every week.

So if the number of ethereum coins was increased 1000x, you think the cap will simply jump up 1000x ? I think the price of ethereum would drop 1000x and keeping the cap roughly the same.  
The cap is not simply the number of coins times the price per coin - it is the number of coins times the price per coin the market has placed on the coin.
If the number of coins increases - the cap will not blindly increase.  The increase in coins will reduce the value per coin.
This is a pure thought experiment - of course in real life increasing the coin count would have detrimental affect on trust - but ignoring that for now.
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:02:35
I knew about bitcoin very early, but I simply didn't go after it.  Had it been easy to buy maybe things would have been different.  But even after I got into bitcoin, ethereum was like $2 - and I did not buy that either. 
This is pure 20/20 hindsight - one just simply does not know how these things will pan out.
The lesson I took away from this, is always to invest something that seems to be truly NEW and UNIQUE.  
BTW there are posts like this when bitcoin was $50.  And there will be another post like this when bitcoin hits $25K.
