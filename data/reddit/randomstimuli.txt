Because both the grocery store and coin star charge fees. I put in $500 worth of loose coins and went home with $400. Not a fan of coinstar

Zero is 100% guaranteed. All things come to an end... anyone arguing $1M is more likely are the ones not thinking and blindly following
1 month
10 years
2 billion years
All things come to an end. Cant beat 100% certainty

Maybe... best laid plans of mice and men ya'know
USD could crash out next year and 3% looks silly. 1 btc=$1MM but it costs $2MM to buy a carton of milk. Is that really what we were thinking "when moon" (cough cough Venezula cough cough)
 
Multiple quantum computers could come out and destroy current cryptography methodologies, making bitcoin useless
I know these are extreme scenarios... but anything can happen. Zero is a guarantee 
Really need to stop counting satoshis and fiat and focus on buying power

Not 100% blockchain/bitcoin but MIT Technology Review does an ok job of updates/analysis relating to the space. I am sure there are other more academic journals that also might be what you are looking for. 
If you track down more, please share. I too (and I think many others as well) are less intrigued by politics or money, and more interested in the actual tech.

Do your own research. Anyone shilling is trying to leave you with a top on a sh!tcoin. Invest in projects you believe in. Hodl and it will still outpace traditional markets.
