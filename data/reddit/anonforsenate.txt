Or have it percentage based.
"Less than 20% of the current price"
"+/- 20% of the current price"
"More than 20% of the current price"
"A lot more than 20% of the current price"
This way you could ask the exact same question at different times and be able to compare them across surveys.
Obviously the way the question is asked should be tweaked, but my idea is still there.

There is always risk. Past performance is no guarantee of the future.
I believe that markets are somewhat efficient. If you want to own bit coin just because it's higher than the last time you checked it then you're essentially gambling.
Do you have a reason to own bit coin? If you do, then buy some. If you want to dabble in an exciting new crypto-currency, then only buy what you're prepared to lose.
All we know is the past price and what it takes to buy a BTC right now.
So ask yourself why you want to own some. Buying some for fun is a fine answer, but you adjust how much you buy based on that desire. If you're buying because it's up 1000% from the past year… maybe that trend will continue and maybe it'll break.
If you want to own a lot of BTC then I'd suggest having a reason to own a lot of it. Like you want to sell BTC through local bit coin, or if you want to have some other business that uses the currency then it might be worthwhile to own more than just a small amount. But I think you should have some reason to own some other than just "it's gone up in the past," if you want more than just a small portion of your savings/investments.
Just my idea. I am not an expert.

I'm not sure if this is real or not, but it does raise an interesting point about security.
AFAIK, printers, fax machines and photocopiers do keep a record of everything they printed. This likely makes "perfect security" impossible. There will always be some sort of copy of any information that is digitally produced.
If you physically pulvarize your printer there is probably just someplace else that has a record of your BTC address.
Also, let's say that perfect security was possible. That would mean that if your paper wallet is destroyed (in a fire, or something else), then you lose all the value inside.
It could be that the safest solution is to pay someone to guard your BTC for you and have insurance on it to prevent against loss. But then we're just basically back at regular banking.

I agree with that, but there is a correct usage in spoken language.
You wouldn't say "He is fewer of a man because he avoided the war." You would say "He is less of a man because he avoided the war."
A native speaker would get it right out of pure habit. Someone who studied grammar would know why "less" is right in that case.
There is nothing wrong with being precise with language. We talk and write so often that being accurate is useful, especially if you want people from other cultures to understand you.
Finally it's just ugly to butcher language. "I'm going to travel at Florida," makes sense, it's just gross, and you out yourself as not knowing, or not caring, the right way.

Well, the only reason why insider trading is a crime is because it's been passed as a law saying that it's a crime.
I don't really see how in a libertarian ethic how insider trading would be illegal (it's not fraud, and it's not coercive or forceful). It could be that the market would adjust to it, or maybe making insider trading illegal is a good piece of law.

With money you get from selling equipment they get enough money to buy parts and labor to buy more equipment.
Their business advantage is in being able to make equipment better than "the other guy".
It's the same reason why someone would sell BTC on local coins. The money they get from a person to person transaction is enough for the seller to buy more BTC and then sell again. The seller's business is having cheap access to BTC and they sell to the buyer at a small premium. If they use the sale price then they can buy more BTC and have a little profit left over. The seller's business is having cheap and easy access to bit coins that the buyer doesn't have.
Also, as mining becomes more difficult mining gear sellers will still have a business making high-tech computing machines and a name brand, where some of the miners are just left with machines that can't really do the job anymore.
This is just my guess though.

It's a store of value, a unit of account, it's divisible and fungible.
But most importantly other people will take it in exchange for goods and services.
The future of bit coin rests on it being taken as payment. A few places do this already. The question is whether more or fewer people will take it as a form of payment in the future, especially as an alternative to other methods (like regular money, other crypto currencies or something else).

Does she have a gift registry?
It depends on your sister but I think a wedding is more of a time for something traditional. Money, something they asked for, things like that.
Bitcoin *could* be a great gift but what I'd worry about is making the gift more about you and your interest (bit coin) and not about her and her needs/interests.
Especially if her soon to be husband is going to be the one to figure it out. It's almost like you're giving them work to do.
Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:55:02
I think this is the real answer. And people remember BTC at 1200 so there is a bias in thinking that it is worth 1200 (which maybe it is, what do I know?)
I feel foolish though because I've wanted to have a bit of BTC in my possession - mostly to understand it better. But it's actually kinda hard to get them, especially in my situation.
I have a Canadian bank account but I am working in South Korea, so most of my wealth is in won and is stuck in the Korean bank system. Hopefully I can transfer some money to Canada, but BTC exchanges there seem to want a Canadian phone number, which I don't have. This makes it *really* difficult.
I guess I have to go to local bit coins. Gah.
Anyways, I'm glad BTC is going up in value, for everyone else's sake. And I like seeing that more and more places are accepting it, which is the backbone of the currency.
This could be easier on users though. I think if I were to explain this to my dad he'd flip a table.

What are going to do for visual elements? I think you would need a computer graphic designer, if you're going to have any "bit coins" on screen. They'd have to be good too, it'll probably drive the cost up.
Otherwise it'd just be a lot of video of computer screens and numbers. Which would be no good.
The visual opportunities are going to be tough.
Another challenge would be travelling to where you need to be. Bitcoin is a global thing, so I think a documentary explaining that should be global. You'd either have to travel to lots of places or maybe use online interviews and movie magic to give a sense to the audience of traveling places. I can think of a few ways that could help it work, but they seem more guerrilla style rather than Hollywood movie style. But I think a doc on bitcoin should have that low-budget, scrappy feel.
However it is very topical. One HUGE advantage is that something is almost guaranteed to happen while you're shooting. I love that in documentaries, when a development happens while the film maker is following the subject.
When giant disadvantage is that it's going to date itself right away. If you even mention that bitcoin's price that will immediately date the doc. Even during the editing time it's at risk of going stale. Bitcoin could do *anything* in 9 months while you're editing.
I think you need a human story in your doc, but I don't know if Satoshi is it. Do you have any chance of finding him?
You could do a "Super Size Me" thing and try to live on BTC for a month and track your progress. Then have some added-value facts, explainers, interviews peppered throughout your day-to-day experiences living on BTC. This would be the same format as Super Size Me. It'd be easier to make and has a human interest angle… sort of. Alternative banking doesn't really scream "human interest".

I doubt Bit Coin would do well in a general, large, crash.
Bit Coin doesn't have the history or reputation of being a safe heaven like Gold or US Bonds have.
Bit Coin is too small for it to be the "go to place" when everyone panics.
The reason is that Bit Coin is a new technological thing. If you're worried about losing your wealth you put your money in boring things. Not things that have only existed for 6 years and have had a meteoric rise and have completely unusual security requirements.
Imagine an old-money family calling up the broker and saying "I'm worried about losing my wealth! Buy something safe!" That broker isn't going to suggest BTC. That broker probably doesn't even know how to buy BTC if she had to.
Seriously. Does an average broker with 20 years experience (or 5, or 40) know how to buy and secure Bit Coin? If they don't then BTC won't do well in a crash. Especially when US Bonds and Gold have a much longer history of being the go-to places.

Its early days.
Another currency might be either better for illicit transactions (better anonymity) or better able to navigate regulatory barriers.
A lot of smart people work for credit cards. What if VISA introduces a currency? They could do everything behind the scenes so that all the users have a familiar interaction with their credit cards but with lower fees and no volatility.
The acceptance of BTC isn't that high. It's not currently better at buying anything than regular money. The goods you can buy with BTC is extremely limited.
That is changing slowly, but as it stands right now I can buy more things I want, and more easily, with iTunes gift cards than BTC.
I think a crypto currency could be very useful.  But why Bitcoin and not an alternative? Bitcoin is the biggest one right now, but it's still highly speculative.
Literally a 20 dollar iTunes gift card is more spendable to most people than 20 dollars in BTC. It's not hard to imagine the market going to something different.
Bitcoin's competitive advantage is the brand. It is the most well-known crypto currency. But crypto currency is barely known as a concept right now.
VISA could have a crypto currency system augment it's business and keep all the complicated security on their back-end and keep the entire thing user-friendly to it's robust and global user base. An installed user base with a trusted brand, one that has good relations with government and users and has no history of silk road.
Or another currency could gain notoriety that has TOR functionality as a default.
If Bitcoin is going to win it has to keep getting more businesses to accept it. It's doing that! But it needs to be a million times more accepted than it is now though to be truly viable. I think something could reach the level of a large, robust user base before BTC is able to reach that level acceptability.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:18:56
Grand Canyon is an understatement.
It may be irrelevant if BTC has a huge ownership gap ("wealth gap" is the wrong word because people who don't own BTC can still be wealthy) but it does present an opportunity for a better crypto currency of being a more attractive medium of exchange.
One thing that has cooled my interest for BTC has been the idea that maybe a better crypto currency is introduced. Bitcoin has no advantage over another crypto currency other than branding.
Sometimes the first thing to market wins; and sometimes the better product wins.
Why not have a crypto currency with better anonymity functions, or is more user friendly.
If the oil producing countries started accepting crypto currency, any crypto currency they accepted would immediately become the winner. If Google released it's own crypto currency it would have a very good shot at being the one that becomes most accepted.

The thing is the time invested.
There are only about 3 people in Seoul who sell BTC and are on Localbitcoins. I figure they have their own mark-up, and it requires both of us to physically meet at a location. So my time gets spent doing that.
Time on a subway and meeting a guy a coffeeshop versus time waiting for an exchange to clear are both things to consider. It'll probably take me 2 or 3 days to actually meet that guy. So the inconvenience is probably worth ~20ish USD to me. Depending on how much BTC I buy an higher fee% might be higher or lower than that.
I really think Korea doesn't have a robust English-speaking BTC community, which is the problem. If I were back in Canada this would be easy.
Still, I just got tipped in BTC and it's been very cool figuring out how this system works. I managed to transfer it to the Coinbase wallet (that I found through this reddit's sidebar) so now I've received bit coins and transferred them. So I'm getting a bit more experience.
I really appreciate this reddit for it's help. The sidebar has been good too!

I felt exactly the same way about a month ago, and then the price of BTC went down a lot, and I was pretty happy I wasn't part of that.
It is pretty hard to get into Bitcoin. I have a weird situation being that I'm a Canadian who is in Korea. So nobody likes my ID and local coins are hard to do and expensive.

Legacy money exchange businesses (paypal, banks, credit cards) reduce their costs enough that people switching away from from their regular currency becomes impractical.
I can send an email to transfer money to anyone who uses, pretty much any, bank in Canada. The only downside is it costs ~2 dollars to do so and I can't transfer less than 10 dollars.
If that fee were lower, and the coverage were better (transfer to people outside the country) then that takes a lot of usefulness out of bitcoin.
Banks might have a bitcoin-like backend and let a regular user do everything in their local currency. I could see how something like that would scuttle bitcoin adoption.

It's more like 4:1 payout.
It depends if you think the price of Mt. Gox BTC is rational or not. If the people who own Mt. Gox BTC have over sold it then it might be a good bet for you. They panic'd and sold and you will get advantage of the panic price.
On the other hand maybe the sellers are right and it's time to get your money out of Mt. Gox right now.
If markets were perfectly efficient then it's a perfectly even bet. The cost of your expected upswing is the risk of Mt. Gox not being able to give you your Bitcoins.
Another factor is "what can you afford to lose." If this plan doesn't work out (say you only get some of the bitcoins you buy, or you can't get any of the bit coins you buy) then how screwed are you? If that's a scenario you can stomach, then go ahead. If it means you can't pay your rent and it jacks up the rest of your finances then that's more reason to steer clear.
This is just my thoughts. I am not an expert and I've only been looking over this subreddit a little. I don't have all the details of Mt. Gox or your situation. I still think it is good advice to never put in more money than you can afford to lose.
How trustworthy is Mt. Gox? Different people will have different answers to that question.

It might be theoretically possible to have bit coins without electricity but it would be absurdly impractical. First of all everyone's records would be wiped out until access to the block chain could be re-established.
I'm not a genius, but you need access to the block chain. If users use "smoke signals" to transmit information without recording it on the block chain then ... well.. that doesn't prevent double spending or anything.
You just need internet access to make it work.

I think before most people were buying and holding Bitcoin. So it wasn't moving through the market. 
As more businesses accept Bitcoin, some of those cold coins have started moving again. When a business gets them they try and sell it right away, which increases liquidity.
That's what I think is going on. I'm no expert though. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:34:10
tl;dr - saying something "could" happen doesn't mean that it would or that it should. It'd be dumb to try to transmit bit coins via smoke signals. And even if that were to happen it would be a different block-chain from the original one, so they wouldn't be the same crypto currency anymore. It'd be a totally new one.
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:55:31
I think it's all the same.
If people are used to a currency increasing in value then contracts will change to reflect that. Instead of expecting a 7% ROI (return on investment) for an investment in a 2% inflation environment you instead get a 5% ROI on a 0% inflation environment. It ends up being a wash.
Even if Bitcoin, or something similar, were to have a natural rate of inflation baked in how would you pick what rate to put it at? Right now the general idea is for central banks to have 2% inflation. But who knows how that'll change in the future. Maybe in the future economic theory wants even more inflation, or less. So the difference between Bitcoin (or whatevers) inflation and the current central banking theory on what inflation *should* be will be mismatched.
I think it's all doesn't matter. Let the currency have a natural inflation or zero inflation or whatever. Savings accounts, expected ROI and loan rates will adjust to cover up any imbalances between the currencies changing value and the real economy.
