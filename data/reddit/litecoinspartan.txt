1) Not banning of selling, they are unable to accept BTC as a payment(nothing new, noticed specifically said Bitcoin cannot be used as a currency in China).  
2) Any ads labeled "Bitcoin/Litecoin miner" will be removed (this is new, on one hand the notice said BTC is not illegal and everyone thought worst case scenario you buy the BTC on sites like localbtc from miners. But now it seems they don't want miners in China as well?).  
3) This might be the start of the "crackdown" in regards to the Jan 31st date. We will see in the next few days if the PBOC will start targeting the exchanges.

BTC China needs to clarify this ASAP!!!! -___-

This is my take: Fact is that banks are not banned. If they wanted to ban bitcoin they would have done it outright along with third party payment processors. Requiring ID in registration for trading accounts, only allowing bank transfers, issuing warnings/notices of compliance, etc. All these steps point to the beginning of a regulated market, not a ban.  
Also if anyone says "they didn't ban banks yet because they are allowing people to take their money out of the exchanges", then they would of not offered the deposit option from banks.  
What are your thoughts?

the communist government says no more third party processors may deal with bitcoin exchanges, so the ceo is accepting money into his personal account and doing the deposit funding manually. He probably thinks he outsmarted the government, but in reality he now risks money laundring charges and potentially can have all the funds in the account frozen until a lengthy court battle to prove otherwise.

lol wow.  
Show this article to those who still don't believe Bitcoin is a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:03:15
that is my plan right now.  
As a non-chinese citizen I now have the upperhand in the exchange as I am free to cash out in USD while they are restricted to RMB.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:49:25
no, because China does not have 30% inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:17:38
stop, just please stop.  
"Deposits temporarily suspended."
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:49:18
lol thats cray-cray.  
Rich ppl are now willing to convert their traditional assets to bitcoins as a storage of wealth.

That was initial thought too, but it is clear that it is not the case. If you look at an article on Coindesk an interview with Bobby Lee said they signed the contract with Yeepay (a new payment processor) on Monday but a few hours later Yeepay called and said they had to cancel the contract. Also Bobby said they were really close to sign another payment processor (after the Yeepay fallout) 2 days ago and will announce it on Weibo (Chinese twitter) in the next few hours. However, still no Weibo post and now this letter.   
This means deposits halted immediately, and the Chinese government is allowing withdrawals up until Chinese New Years (according to rumors).  
But again, we won't know for sure until the PBOC makes an official statement.

Please don't spread misinformation unless it is confirmed.  
You can go to FXBTC.com as well  and it still says Tenpay is available.  
They most likely haven't updated it yet, but unless we can get a confirmation please don't lead people to believe that they have it sorted out.  
I almost panic bought cause of you -___-.

Jan 31st, end of withdrawal date.
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:48:01
I wouldn't bank on it if I were you. Remember there was a jan 31st date(Chinese new year). If it wasn't for deposits (halted immediately), than it can only mean its withdrawals. If this is true shame on Bobby lee for misleading quotes.

good news for speculators.  
EDIT: As much as i know how much some of you will hate it, these guys will provide stability. Imagine a situation like the panic sell last week, when you have panic sellers tanking the price by 20-25% in a mere few hours you will now have big money using this chance to scoop up million of dollars worth of bitcoins in one trade and reversing the price back to the mean. The reverse is also true, when you have those mania phases these guys will unload their bitcoin inventory back into the market until the demand is satisfied.

i think you are celebrating too early.  
Everyone is downplaying the rumor that third-party transfer options must end by Chinese New Year (Jan 31st, 2014). This means withdrawal option as well.  
What do you think will happen to BTC prices when you can't deposit money into the exchanges and you have until Chinese New Year to withdrawal all your money?
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:22:00
just make a damn account yourself and take a look.  
I told you before, you don't listen. Jan 31st, 2014 is the last day to withdrawal money from Chinese exchanges. BTC China or any Chinese exchange will not and cannot provide anymore deposits since Tuesday. I am not saying BTC is dead but we have to accept the fact China should no longer be looked at as the main driver for BTC prices.
