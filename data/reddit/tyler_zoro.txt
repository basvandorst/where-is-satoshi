That's partially true... but the reality is that the currency in the US is really cents. We just arbitrarily treat 100 cents as a single unit, but if a dollar truly were a single unit, then cents would be a fiction... and they're not. You can literally hold one cent in your hand, collect 100 of them and redeem them for a one dollar note or coin without going through any third party, and everyone respects that transaction as core to the economy.
... which is just as arbitrary as saying that $1m is the real unit and everything else is just a sub-division.


But the "one bitcoin" concept is even more arbitrary, since the resolution of the currency was set extremely arbitrarily. The only fundamental unit in the BTC world is really the Satoshi (1/100m BTC). And so, in the same sense that a "cent" is the fundamental unit of what we call USD, the Satoshi is the fundamental unit of BTC.

I care much more about the technology than my paltry investment. I'd much rather see Bitcoin become a transformative solution to our absurd fiat system than make a dime. But I don't mind my investment being worth something.

Historical Bitcoin Jesus was a real person, but he was just a hungry college student. He never actually parted the blockchain... or was that Bitcoin Moses... I get them confused with Bitcoin Krishna (he was the one that got Satoshi to fight the banks, right?)

This is not a realistic way to view Bitcoin ownership, when the vast majority of individuals (but almost certainly not the largest stakeholders) "own" Bitcoin through an exchange, and never withdraws it to a private wallet.


Bully for them. I don't have to care. That's the beauty of Bitcoin.


And part of the decentralization is that you have to accept that some people will want to create new or leverage old centralization schemes. That won't affect Bitcoin as a currency, only potentially its ephemeral value as a unit of exchange to such legacy frameworks.

But fundamentally violating the underlying principle of peer-to-peer money is an underlying principle of peer-to-peer money. The very fact that people are doing things with the currency that those with the most stake in the currency do not approve of is proof positive that it works.

Um... that sounds illegal on many fronts. PII that's divulged to investors for their use in personal grudges, depending on the state, can be enough to not only go after the investor, but to shut down the company.

They ***request*** the printing of paper. The Mint prints it, and the Mint is a Federal agency under Treasury.
Edit: Not sure why people are confused by this. Did anyone think that the Federal Reserve Banks actually print currency?!
I suppose the confusion comes about where people often short-hand by saying that programs like QE are "printing money," which they are not. They do involve complex processes that lead to the Fed requesting and the Mint printing more currency, but that's still the Mint.

True, but this will settle out over time. Insurance, regulation and security standards develop around new financial technologies... The question is only one of, how far down that road do we need to get before you decide that it's "stable enough"? 


True, but that's just volatility arising from the lack of consumers. As the number of consumers rises, that becomes more and more impractical. 


True, but the value in BTC is its mindshare, especially when it comes to technical users. 
It's a very difficult barrier to entry.

This is not true. The Bavarian Illuminati (not the first to use that name, but the best known) were founded in 1776 in Bavaria by Adam Weishaupt, a professor of law. He modeled their initiation on several other extant societies, including Freemasonry, but also included a political philosophy that was actively antagonistic to the Catholic Church and the Bavarian monarchy. Needless to say,  this did not end well, and the Illuminati were banned and Weishaupt a fugitive within 20 years.
However, the philosophical legacy of the Illuminati continued, and there are reasonable claims that it continued to influence the political climate of Western Europe (especially France) for the first half of the 19th century.
Other groups since have adopted either the name or the philosophical outlook or both, and several exist today (though, to be fair, most are scams, using the name to fleece the gullible).
The equation of the name "Illuminati" with grandiose conspiracy theory, however, was mostly seeded by the 1970s comedic/science-fiction work, *The Illuminatus! Trilogy*, by Robert Anton Wilson. Though the book was a parody, its conspiracy mono-theory went on to become the basis of many earnest members of the conspiracy community during the 1980s, and today few even realize where the confluence of ideas came from.
Not saying your impulse was wrong, here, but the truth is more complex than a simple rejection of the name might indicate.

You don't measure relative costs of living in terms of what people choose to buy, but what they *must* buy, that is, in terms of staples. How much does an egg cost? How much is a box of pasta? How much is a gallon of milk or an apple? These are staple foods. You don't care about the increase in the price of Oreos when you're calculating cost of living.
The science of tracking inflation is, you might be shocked to learn, harder than just "Lol".

I think that's a good thing. We need the next major wave of investment to come from real news, not speculation. I'm holding out hope for the first (probably very small) national currency to issue some BTC-backed notes to happen sometime this or next year.
That will change everything, and will probably snowball and have some terrible moments, but overall there's no turning back after that.

This sub is mostly about cheerleading, commiserating and popular Bitcoin news. If you're looking for insight as to the short and long term prospects for Bitcoin, that really isn't this.
But here's my usual advice around any financial instrument: if you invested more than you can afford to lose, you made a mistake. If you're invested with money you can afford to lose, don't let ups and downs change your perspective. If it was worth buying, it still is.

Interestingly, one of those examples is not really giving you the whole story. [This LA Times article]( explains that Clifford Stoll's forward-looking appraisal of the Internet in 1995 was shockingly correct on many points, and wrong on a few... But we only like to quote the bits that he got wrong.
I don't think that the future of Bitcoin is that its detractors will be mostly right, but perhaps that's the cautionary tale we should take from such glib quote-fests...

They could have, but then the problem with that statement would be clear: many humans have wanted many financial instruments to do many things that they have acted contrary to. That's because these are chaotic, often unstable (in the systems analysis sense) systems. That means that the result of wanting can be unpredictable and even counter-intuitive.

It's as wrong as it is in terms of evolution. We anthropomorphize evolution all the time, but we have to be very, very careful to remind ourselves that that's only an analogy, and evolution doesn't "want" anything.
