Guys this Bcash scam coin pump and dump is getting out of hand. In all seriousness we can't let a deflationary currency be usable. How can I send my 2000 rupees worth of btc to an exchange without losing my street-shitting money? Im asking for a friend and definitely not because I want to use a coin that doesn't have 50$ fees. HODL xD
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:32:07
just go back to the next HODL meme XD thread then
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:00:37
Another interesting thing to look at is just flat out interest in a coin, by using google trends. Before Monero went up around ~80% it had a huge spike in google searches the few days before. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:57:16
God Reddit is so terrible. Why do I even post here when anything not about "HODL TO THE MOON XDD" just gets censored by downvotes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:35:33
Then why do we need lightning network?
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:53:03
You should put in your title "and being useless as a currency." That makes it even more astonishing. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:42:39
Yes he did, he is not retarded. You are lying just like all those other deluded "hodlers" who never use Bitcoin and just want it to go up in price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:04:40
Because I'm assuming Bitcoin stays decentralized and thus the number of lightning network nodes is enough to make that true while Bitcoin is widely adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:44:06
It doesn't matter the scale you absolute plonker, it is literally not profitable to attack Bitcoin like that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:39:04
Yes, thank you Roger :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:20:52
No but just changing Bitcoin Core's white paper is, because I don't think it will reflect the original one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:43:57
This illiterate Bernie Sanders socialist doesn't sound like he gives much of an argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:15:42
By normal I mean on-chain, not the reddit meme of buying small things. So how will they not cost hundreds if adoption becomes widespread and things stay decentralized as they are? 
EDIT: And as you know on-chain transactions are the same price as opening a lightning network node.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:26:17
I don't believe your first claim, but either way a segwit transaction is not the same as the cost of running a lightning network node. And yes I assume fees to run one will go up to hundreds of dollars because in the post I am also assuming Bitcoin STAYS DECENTRALIZED while adoption becomes widespread. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:06
Pretty depressing. I mean I already couldn't buy anything on there because of the fees but it used to be a nice way to spend btc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:36:30


That's a good thing. You don't want market values to be incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:02:52
Why is that? Not enough Lightning Network nodes to push up real transactions? That sounds like it becomes centralized (against what I asked).
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:20:41
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:09:44
I guess most redditors are such soyboys they can't do anything but down vote criticism.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:51:40
How is this the case when (as I said) it Bitcoin becomes largely adopted and normal transactions and opening a node costs a minimum of hundreds of dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:44:46
The lightning network does not make it peer to peer though, you have to rely on larger nodes to send money. So it is not peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:21:33
But inside traders have an incentive to *not* be deceptive, because they are actively revaluing a market based on facts. There is no intention to deceive.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:23:02
An ISP is not a peer. You can still send data from one peer to another from computer to computer. If that's not the case then many computer scientists need to change what they think about the meaning of peer to peer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:37:39
Everything he said is correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:57:33
It is an argument, its just a fallacy. And it's not fraud, fraud is deceptive. Buying into a stock and therefore boosting its value based on real facts is not deceptive.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:30:49
I really doubt anyone can pay the hundreds of dollars to run a node.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:11:21
So then Lightning Network makes everything centralized at the cost of faster transactions then, sounds like we ought to have just made the blocks bigger instead of this complicated re-inventing of the wheel crap.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:26:04
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:33:54
Yes, and you are starting up a node for helping people send and receive Bitcoin since they can no longer do it *peer-to-peer*. Hence the question. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:40:01
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:20:48
Nah dude bro it was the fully sickest, what you don't agree with me? Bro how fucking dense are you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:42
People use gold.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:25
Don't you get it? None of these complaints about hour long transactions and 5$ fees are legit, it's all just a bunch of shills bought and paid for by the mining cartel.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:31:44
Eat shit corecucks




@_date: 2017-12-21 05:16:07
They are both illegal, and they are both illegal for stupid reasons. They are a bit related.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:19
Lightning Network is just around the corner. Keep replying sad boy, I'm sure that will stop your coin from crashing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:25:08
Democracy is shit tier so I don't know what you are talking about
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:44:58
An incredibly ignorant statement that Milton Friedman agrees with. And you haven't given an example to why it is fraudulent, saying things like that without reasoning is not good.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:09:44
Its cool how the percentages are almost exactly lined up with the price.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:57
Yes my friend HODL your useless coin to the moon! There is literally zero chance of it going down as we all know.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:48:19
So assuming as I said in the post and Bitcoin goes to the level of 1/10th of visa, you are going to pay the extraordinary fees to open a LN node? What for? You will literally be competing with giant servers and companies running their own nodes to get money from fees.
EDIT: Also you are still a larger node in comparison to a single peer, assuming you get any transactions through thanks to your node.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:03:11
Is there a reason you're asking this?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:54:12
There is literally nothing wrong with insider trading, unless you're a marxist who thinks making money is automatically bad and evil.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:55:35
What girl? ;_;
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:52:35
Dude bro, fully sick my man totally narly. Shut your mouth stupid fuck

Good dog, keep doing as I ask.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:14:08
My questionj is pretty understandable if you've looked at the white paper.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:00
You are a bit mad
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:36:28
Those same countries make it illegal to smoke harmless pot. They are clowns.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:32:22
A node is not a peer. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:34:31
What a fucking joke. Bend over on your knees for the mob everyone, not like crypto was meant for shitting on the government or anything...
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:47:23
I guess in a way you're right. There might be something wrong with not wearing puffy pants if it means you get punished for it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:08
It's feeling so great watching assholes like you lose money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:21:39


It is even harder to see that without insider trading. And legality is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:42:08
Already up to around 15$, yeah it's totally impossible hey.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:42:16
Why is the one that is cheap and fast the shit one? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:04:57
Can I post here? HODL TO THE MOON XD
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:25:41
The price is irrelevant, you are a very sad individual if you cling to attacks like that whenever answering tough questions. 
Also hint-hint: I am holding Bitcoin. So no.
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:36:53
Right, so it isn't necessary. I guess Bitcoin all of a sudden takes seconds to transact again, and that the devs are making these side chains "just in case".
Why don't you tell me a reason for a side chain if its not necessary to make transacts fast again?
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:02:15

@_date: 2017-10-09 21:44:02
It feels a bit like a time loop. First fork, rise to 5,000, drop to price way before fork, rise to 5,000...
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:35:10
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:06:53
That's one use. They are still necessary for any decent speed transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:25:52
Amazon will probably not  accept it until the fees and transfer times get sorted out. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:12:04
Which sub is the one infamously known for censorship, why is it the one you frequent, and how does allegedly being a shill make my argument wrong?
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:46:07
You're not going to be able to use it as a real currency. Good luck buying groceries without a sidechain, when there are 2 hour confirmation times. Some people actually want this to be superior to fiat and not just some speculative asset. 
Also lightning network is at least a full year away, there is a huge chance the transaction efficiency gets exponentially worse by then. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:06:38
Forcing everyone to rely on side chains to make transactions will make things far more centralized than if you just let the Blocksize increase. Also, the more useful Bitcoin is the more miners there will be. Bitcoin right now, as something to buy small things every day, is totally useless and so there are less miners than there would be if it were on a bigger block.
I don't get your justification for your second and third point. You seriously believe only your view of whats "important" should be store on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:33:11
It's very disheartening. More and more I begin to think that Bitcoin has been compromised by developers with the only goal being to make money. They say they want a fee market and that "there is nothing wrong with full blocks" despite fees and time skyrocketing, and you really have to question their intentions. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:11:18
The idea is that the miners will still want to hold up the system, because they will get payed in fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:26:35
upvoted my kind sir, I love le reddit /s symbol because what I say could never come across as sarcastic without a reddit /s to let you know that what im saying is not true. 
Going from pennies to dollars and seconds to hours is not skyrocketing /s
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:17:02
Wow you sure got me with your personal attacks and downvotes. And my point still stands because they serve as a middleman while you wait for transactions to go through. It results in a "faster" transaction because it evades the blockchain. It is necessary if BTC is to become used around the world as a currency and not a speculative asset. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:10:16
How are they not forced to rely on side chains? How in the world could you possibly pay for real world items without a sidechain or centralized holder who you pray will make the transactions go through eventually?
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:57:24
Why are big blocks not safe?
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:46:51
Great source from a lying edgy clown. wtf I love high fees and slow transactions now
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:14:31
Lol, 20k for a node what a load of lies. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:56:01
It doesn't matter that I can make my own, I'm just a small fish. What matters is the fact that core are essentially admitting that side chains are necessary while showing why they happen to believe "a fee market must develop"
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:47:34
Seeing how a non-scam fork like Bitcoin cash plummets itll be interesting to see how fast the obvious Bitcoin Gold scam hits $0.05. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:47:38
Why would bigger blocks be damaging? Don't you know that Bitcoins market dominance plummeted once the blocks became full and everything inevitably became unusable?
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:16:28
They wouldn't bother trying to sell this sort of stuff if it wasn't necessary. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:36:52
I was led to believe that the whole reason to be against 2MB was that it would be difficult for "smaller miners" to setup, thus leading to centralization. To force everyone to rely on side chains is far worse, and now Bitcoin's whole purpose of being your own bank is ruined.
