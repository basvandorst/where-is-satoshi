Had a SV650S back in the days but I sold it real quick because I didn’t like the radical ergos (a real wrist breaker). Had a couple liter bikes, a Bandit 1200S.. but now I just want a good all arounder that will help me keep my licence ;)

Someone should really hack that fucking website for good. **Anonymous** anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:16:18
No I mean, how much for the plane ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:11:57
How much?

You’re 100% right. I also think a shitload of people drive cars they can’t really afford if they want to build wealth over time. I’d be curious to know the percentage of people driving in cars they actually own vs cars on financing. I look around and see way too much BMW, Audis, Mercedes. I bet most of those wanna be rich people couldn’t actually pay their vehicle cash. It’s only speculation, but I’m pretty sure.
For me, I’m driving an old Toyota Echo from 2005 and I feel fucking good about it. I say my Lambo is a SV650 but honestly, I’m not sure I’ll want to withdraw the money next summer... maybe I’ll just pick a fucking scooter to move around the city and keep the rest in crypto ;) Hodl.

I like Guzzis but living in Canada, dealers are very scarce. Japanese dealers are plentiful

It's crazy how Blankfein refutes even talking about their strategy about BTC. And if they don't have an innovation department that talk those things, I'm just really scared for Goldman. It illustrates how they just don't follow a basic management rule : always look for competition and threats to your business model and **ADAPT**.

For privacy reasons, I try to avoid Chrome at all cost. Does it work with Safari ?

Lol. I’m not stupid but rational. Why would I buy a supercar if I can’t use it to more than 10% of its capabilities? Seems extremely wasteful.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:12:33
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:28:06
Yeah I also heard the authorities let you go the speed you want when you have a supercar. It’s also not a cop magnet at all.

Anybody knows if this update enable the usage without Chrome? They announced they would develop macOS and Windows apps for those who don't want to rely on Chrome apps.
