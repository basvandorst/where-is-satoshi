Can you tell the TX fee before your send? If so, how?

Just bought $4k more BTC. Thought I would never see an opportunity like this after it went to $19k+. At least not this soon. Never. What a wonderful Fun Dip. 
Go me! Go me!

Oh no doubt about it. Thank you. The only thing I'm scared of is if the blockchain is or ever could be compromised. If not? I feel like this baby is still on a trejectory straight to the moon! It's unstoppable.

**BITTREX IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST! DARE I SAY, SCAM??!**
I tried advanced verification and it failed. It's been close to ***TWO MONTHS*** and I've only gotten 1 auto response after multiple emails to them. 
Thank God I tried verifying before I bought some coin.

It took me 5 weeks to get enhanced verified n bittrex. I finally got to then through Twitter with my ticket number.

Thank you. You know. Gotta dust my shoulder off! ;)

Excuse my ignorance. What's ATH?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:37:28
Lol This gotta be a joke
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:36
Wow. I should've known that. 
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:26:37
Can anyone guide me to where I can learn about this new US tax reform situation and how we're supposed to pay taxes on every trade??? I'm lost. 
Also, is there any loop home around this?

But have a gun license and commit a crime with it in PA? You'll get the maximum amount of time for that charge.

I bought a ledger nano s from Amazon. Got it over night. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:03
To be totally honest. I want it to stay like this or go lower. Until I have extra money to get more of a position. Than... Just than I want it to go back up. I'm a HODLER anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:26:50
I feel your pain. Did almost the same. I may but r in and $2K!
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:15:47
That's so fucked up, isn't it? Who can confuse the two? Anyone would anchor anything with 'Voor' an think of Jason Voorhees. I guess he intentionally wanted to HACK the article!

That's the classic "you're a kook"  defense. When you have them by the balls. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 18:17:11
Use Bitcoin for dollars and Dogecoin for change!
@_date: 2015-12-08 03:04:20
No way?!

Got'em! 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:58:44
Exactly. It was made by the people for the people! You don't *have* to use it. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:22:18
But who are we to  believe at the end of the day - the government? Why? Why can't we just take responsibility for our own actions? Simple as that. 
When a coke head sniffs coke, doesn't he know that at any point he may die? It's a gamble, baby! 
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:12:08
If you make a large bitcoin purchase from a merchant and they get audited. Would the merchant have to know your personal information an bitcoin address or just your bitcoin address? How can the IRS get back to you, the buyer? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:48:09
Good way to make people download your app! 
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:08:53
Golden lol
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:31:58
How and why? What's going on? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:35:20
*When it comes to the poker scandals and people not leaving or closing their poker accounts even with the ease of the Internet.*
It's because they were stupid enough to stay out of greed a thinking it wasn't them getting cheated only certain players. Most of the players were low stake players doing what the site is designed for - *Gambling*. 


 
You're right. But how many people lost homes, jobs, and the value of their homes?? Millions.

I can't fucking believe that you're getting down voted, when your 100% right. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:37:43
Good point 
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:15:24
What would be so hard about a peer to peer market place on Reddit with a 3rd party person to verify like in That's where I purchased my Dogecoin. Went smoothly for me, I verified and left feed back on the sellers post about how professional an quick he was. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:02:05
The Rothschild's did this, no?
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:25:51
Got damn! This was too funny. I'm dying here. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:27:46
Thank you. I'm aware an open to trading all crypto currencies. I should've made it more clear. I'll check out the sub that your linked. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:43:54
Thank you very much for this detailed response. Im definitely going to read in to it!
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:53:59
That's what I was looking for. Kinda scary for a newbie like myself 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:36:20
I'm surprised you would think that. Because most "conspiracy theorist" love Bitcoin because they believe it's taking power aways from the elite and putting it back into the people's hands. 
Plus, if they're so tech illiterate how come they're the ones that knew about most facts that were once conspiracies e.g Edwin Snowden's case with mass servalance?
It ain't easy making all these YouTube UFO and Illuminati videos, ya'kno?!!

So that means I can play from NY?
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:16:35
Thank you. No need to source. I'll take your word for it. I just can't believe someone running that site would do such stupid moves like that! Unbelievable
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:12:28
Did he really **really** do all that?!
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:08:53
$4. Four fucking dollars a bitcoin I've seen back in the days on 4chan. I don't own not one!!!!! Always thought it was a bubble. $40-$120-$220-$800-$1200-$1800 and now fucking $2800?!!! FML. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:28:16
We didn't think this silly 4chan thing would be so serious. At least that's my justification. Who would've known?? Hey, if it's any help I've heard from "top analyst" that I can reach up to one million per Bitcoin. So we still have a chance hopefully. For now I'm going to by a few bits.
