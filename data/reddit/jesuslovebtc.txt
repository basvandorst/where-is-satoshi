"This is Good for Bitcoin".
If people in Hawaii can't buy with Coinbase, they will buy from LBC.  And when that is outlawed, it will be even better for Bitcoin.

The same way NY and NC did it.
And when Russia or anyone else bans LBC, it hurts Bitcoin adoption rates and lowers trade volume vs if they didn't ban it. That is obvious.  
Your statement that "they all got VPNs" is absurd.

That's what people said in late 2013 before the price plummeted to $200, but of course could be true this time.

This is good news for Bitcoin.
Just think of they block it in more places..then if every country blocked it!
Then if they executed people for using it.
That would make BTC more valuable and make more people want to use Bitcoin.
So this is great news (just not great news for everyone in Russia and everyone else on the planet).

Yes of course.  That was my point.  I was being over the top sarcastic.

No, for ~~hundreds of~~ thousands of people, it has been essential for some time now.  So in the last month, it has become essential for you and in the next month, it will become essential for some other people, while others will no longer find it essential.
