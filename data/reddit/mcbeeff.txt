The federal reserve doesn't print money either. They can create money using monetary policy but the goal is not to steal money, it's to regain price stability. The "banker" who  "creates" money doesn't physically have more money in his account. The may buy back bonds, decrease interest rates and discount rates or decrease the amount of money banks are allowed to have in their vaults. None of this means the machine is literally printing out bills, that's the governments mandate.

No, we learned money is a highly liquid financial asset. I think everything you described is just a consequence of money.

During a recession businesses have unmet expectations which means they are pessimistic about future price levels so they decrease the amount of investments, economic or financial, that they may have done otherwise. This causes aggregate expenditure to decrease dramatically. If nobody is spending their money how can you expect growth? Unemployment is high because firms have to cut costs since the value of the dollar is decreasing,  reducing real gdp even further and the value of your money is getting even worse. Inflation is high so banks aren't loaning out any money because it's not worth for them in the long run. The entire economic system begins to collapse under itself driving everything to a halt.
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:48:56


That's not how the recession happened in 2008. It was due to excessive loans in anticipation for the housing market to increase in value when it did the opposite(among other factors). This can happen under bitcoin or any crypto. Loans, debit and credit will 100% be apart of the new economy but the difference is with bitcoin for example, you can't inflate the currency and stimulate growth. Imagine if the economy ran on bitcoin right now(which doesn't even make sense since its priced in terms of dollars), the amount of volatility would already cause massive recessions and expansions uncontrollable. The price level is far to unstable, one day your bitcoin could be worth $10k and the next day it will be worth $8k. That's already a 1.25% change in value in a single day, we should expect that type of change in one year under the dollar.  The reason it's so unstable is because people treat bitcoin like a financial investment, hoping their coins will increase in value tomorrow or holding onto their assets for future use. People aren't generally spending bitcoin for economic investments causing major stall in economic growth. 


Fixed supply currency doesn't force salability. You can have the same problems with a fixed currency as you could with a unfixed supply. The only requirements is that  the total supply is publicly known and has a given growth rate. You can also run into other problems with a fixed supply, like not having enough money in circulation. If I'm living under this new currency with a population of 327 mil people, each making roughly 60k a year you would only have enough currency to pay people for exactly 1 year. Soon everyone will petition to create their own money like this did in NY in order to increase the money supply. 


Don't you get it? That's the problem, people are holding onto bitcoin in hopes for the future. This currency will NEVER be adopted or taken seriously when the community doesn't even want to spend their money.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:19:02
When you deposit money into a bank, the banks keep a percentage called the reserve ratio and lend out the rest as credit loans. If the bank kept your money on hand as physical deposits then they wouldn't have any money to loan out now and you wouldn't have enough money to pay for that new car or house.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:08:38

Im not against crypto but what the article is saying I agree with. There will never be full adoption of bitcoin or any crypto unless certain problems like price stability, liquidation and acceptability is solved. Not to mention one of the main issues is many users actually view crypto as a financial asset and not a medium of exchange. We want people to spend their money to increase circulation, not save it in hopes future price levels increase. That's literally the opposite of what you want in a new currency.
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:03:56
Inflation is not a concept invented by keyns. The entire point of of the system to to reduce price fluctuation and achieve stability by incentivizing private investments. You've got it mixed up and backwards.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:46:39
\&gt; Keynesian economists say... we need to print more money to fix problems  caused by excessive money printing, and you can't just print up a bunch  of Bitcoin to bail out your criminal loser buddies.
It's actually common practice under the Keynesian system and makes sense. In order to handle recessions you have to implement expansionary policies which means incentivizing people to spend their money, increase investments and increase rGDP. With bitcoin you have no way of handling these type of recessions like the ones in 2008.

No, when you print money associated with that gold it specifies how much gold you are giving away on the bank note. So if they deposited the bank note into a bank they would receive that amount of gold. otherwise it's treated like regular currency

If we are talking definition of money then like I said, it's a highly liquid financial asset. What you are talking about is how money circulates through the economy, non of which is unusual or alarming. We definitely learned about debt, credit..anything you would learn in a 1st year econ class.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:54:37
How is printing money theft? What are you even talking about. How is printing money not equivalent to mining bitcoin. When an economy prints money, which they don't do often and only in a financial crisis, it's to increase government spending which thereby increases private investments to bring stability back to the economy. How is the goal of price stability theft to you?

I wouldn't agree that it demands exponential growth. The system is flexible in the sense that profit of the banks is preferred but depending on the economic circumstances the banks can either limit growth or induce growth but the goal is price stability and increased wellbeing.
Lets say exponential growth is not desirable, then would you be saying that stagnant inflation and AE is preferable?
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:53:34


Explain. 


Well because the value of their money won't increase unless rgdp increases. How do you suppose rgdp will increase under bitcoin? It's not at all necessary for rgdp to experience continual economic growth if left completely alone.

Can someone explain how bitcoin is non-deflationary when LOLLI also wants to issue bitcoin credit cards? Deflation is tied to the price level of goods and services, issuing credit is like giving out loans on bitcoin and increasing the amount of coins in circulation can certainly deflate the currency, and therefore change its purchasing power. Would this be against some of the core agendas of the bitcoin community?

@_date: 2019-07-25 16:02:27
You are requiring an ideal capitalist regime from the banks that is not even imposed on it's citizens. Have you ever taken out a loan? For your education or to buy a house, maybe to pay off some other kinds of debt? You are "getting bailed out" by somebody else's money in the same way a bank gets bailed out by the Fed. The way a bank creates money is by taking the money you deposited, keeping a percentage of it and then lending it out to other people. The only way this causes bank failure is if the bank doesn't keep enough money in the vaults or everybody requests their entire funds from the bank at once. Either way, the Fed has to step in and loan the bank money to provide the currency to it's users. Are you saying we should get rid of loans for the sake of purist capitalist form?

You don't get it do you. Bitcoin wants to be it's own currency. It's not, because you still need to exchange it for a real currency. That's why it matters. Crypto will never overthrow fiat money when it relies on fiat money to make it's purchases. 


What's bad about that? When people don't spend their money, they zero money becomes income for other people. When I buy a car, that money becomes the salary of joe salesmen, who then spends that money on bills or maybe even invests. When people can't spend money, usually because they fear if they spend now then they missed out on future increase in price level, the economy stalls.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:25:42
They didn't purchase it in bitcoins. Bitcoin is recognized as a commodity, not a currency. The problem is people take bitcoins as a financial investment, they buy bitcoins with dollars, hold those bitcoins(meaning less bitcoins are circulating in the economy, which can be bad for a currency) until future price levels increase. This is by definition not a currency. The lambo transaction was not done in bitcoins, but bitcoins helped gain actual currency(dollars) to purchase the lambo.

@_date: 2019-08-02 17:26:19
IT's not always advantages for an economy to have a continually rising value of currency. You want stability. If the value of bitcoin is always rising then people are less likely to spend their coins because in the future it could be worth more. When people aren't spending coins then business won't earn money.
So yes, the economy is working well under the dollar but it would be catastrophic under bitcoin.

From someone else's deposits. The banking system creates new money by lending out the deposits of another. This is fine, only flaw is if they reserve ratio isn't set correctly. Even if everyone tries to retract all their deposits, the private bank can still take a loan from the Fed or from other private banks. Everyone gets their money in the end.

First of all, the government doesn't make that decision on the monetary side. Thats the Feds job. 
Secondly it's in their best interest to produce stable prices and economic growth because they are motivated, just like everyone else, by the capitalist guise, the paradigm of profit.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:15:10


What are you even saying? You want prices to fall continually? Do you even understand what that has done in the past?


This is exactly the opposite of what people actually do given this scenario. This type of behavior has been studied extensively in economics and history. It is very very likely people will hold their money and store it for future. If every 3 years your money increases by an order of magnitude then spending that money is literally the single worst thing you could do with it. Why not just wait another 3 years and make 100k? by spending 2 grand now you are giving up earning 20k in the future, all things equal. Not smart. 


That's what the entire field of economics studies. Decision making. So yes it's well documented and researched. It's deeper then just you or my opinion. These opinions have to cohere with economic theory. 


You don't understand how it works. The goal is price stability because with stable prices people are more optimistic about future expenditure. So when the Fed cuts the interest on the funds rate, even tho it may devalue the dollar slightly, it incentives people to spend their money which will increase economic growth. The Fed can also increase the funds rate, or sell bonds, or decrease the reserve ratio in order to deflate the currency if they need to avoid hyperinflation or limit economic growth. These policies are designed to increase economic growth and maintain stable prices.

The opposite of spend. IDK what  paradigm you are operating under but people are not spending bitcoin and that is one of the central issues.
and btw the type of spending that drives an economy is not little packets of gum but economic private investments. Major spending into factories to increase production. That kind of spending. Nobody would ever think of spending the amount of bitcoin. it's just not wise.

This is the ideologue mentality I fear within this community. You claim bitcoin is a safety net when it's prices fluctuate more then any currency we have seen. The reason the government went off the gold standard is because of this very problem. No way to regulate inflation or deflation because it became impossible to manipulate the money supply. The value of the dollar was far to high to meet economic demands, people were saving their money and so we cut the dependence on gold.  Bitcoin is impossible to manipulate when it reaches its peak of 21 mil coins. Soon, there will be a time when there is not enough bitcoins in circulation to meet demand and deflation will occur, and there will be no way out.
