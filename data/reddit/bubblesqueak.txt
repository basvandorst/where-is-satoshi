Which ever geek convinced the boss that BTC was a good idea deserves a fatty raise and bonus.

Word of warning. A lot of citizens think UFC is a disgusting blood sport from the days of the Roman colosseum.
You want a sponsorship with universal   appeal?  Kids camps, food banks, special Olympics teams...  It does not matter what the sponsorship is but it should be universally appealing and you need a good PR team to hype it to the press.  
Frankly a BTC sponsored special Olympics team should generate tons of good press in time for Rio 2016.

Really? Is this a thing?. Regulated bitcoin?  Sad.
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:22:18
This is terrible news.
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:35:23
If the banks get a hold of BTC it means BTC has lost.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:50:36
Probably my tinfoil hat is too tight but PayPal is the enemy and goes against what makes btc so great, decentralized and hands off.  
PayPal has a history of seizing funds if you fart sideways.  PayPal is the enemy.

Nothing good can come of this.

When big banks get a piece of this they will want regulation, historically bank regulation makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.  Why was BTC created?  Not for the banks, that is for sure.  
BTC will become the commodity that this community swears it is not.  
Regulation will benefit the banks or it will kill BTC, either of which is a great outcome for the banks.

This.  This is amazing news for alternative currencies and a BIG milestone in BTC's history.  Great.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:01:51
Formatting killed my thought, recent edit should clear it up.  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-09-24 03:23:09
PayPal is evil and nothing good well come from this.
@_date: 2014-09-28 08:45:56
PayPal will ruin btc.  PayPal is evil.
@_date: 2014-08-11 01:50:53
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:16:14
Agreed.  Regulation is the exact opposite of what btc was created for.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:05:33
PayPal is the devil, I don't understand why is do excited to see them looking at btc.  Bitcoin was created as an alternative to the likes of PayPal, lest ye forget!
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:05:58
Because I fear they will fark it up by either demanding regulation or purposely creating a scandal to show btc in a bad light.  
This is PayPal remember?  A primary reason alternate currencies were created.  PayPal is no friend.
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:18:16
I'm seeing quick downvotes of posts critical of btc regulation.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:06:05
Translation: "We think it's time the feds step in and regulate this currency so we can make money from it".
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:16:40
What the hell is the Bitcoin foundation?  I thought Bitcoin was meant to "foundation-less".  Are these guys making decisions that affect me; a user of btc somehow?
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:19:04
So cex_io, discuss already.  Saying you want to discuss and then doing the opposite... well...  you know.
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:52:38
North American politics are so backwards when the almighty dollar wins like this.  You would be better to fund the revolution.

Another BTC hack?  This is supposed to be happening less and less, are we not learning from our mistakes or is this technology not manageable?
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:45:47
Here is a real world example of how btc adoption failed a new user.
Customer was hit with a ransomware computer infection that encrypted all of his data files and demanded $500USD for the key, to be paid via btc.  The client did not have backups so he agreed to pay the ransom.  We setup an account with localbitcoins but could not find any sellers that would sell us this amount without some prior history.  We tried with one seller that had a good rep and went through all his loopholes and verification schemes and in the end seller ignored us.  
A full day was wasted by failing to buy 
"magical internet money" to pay crooks. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:28:01
How so inaccurate?
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:49:17
While I disagree that Chinese internet is not a bottleneck would you agree that it could be a cork?  China has a tight control of traffic in and out could shut off traffic to that 51% in about ten seconds if it wanted to.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:30:21
Supposedly China has absolute control of traffic coming in and out of it's borders, hence the name "The Great Firewall of China".
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:19:15
Nothing in the article is inaccurate as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2015-04-19 07:49:31
Frig-off Randy!
@_date: 2015-11-21 19:38:52
That the point.
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:29:32
Why the down votes?  This is exactly correct.  Too many wallet thefts and online exchange hacks are a result of poor coding.  This is money, it has to be rock solid and errors have to be exposed asap.  
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:43:34
Every two months or so we read about thousands of dollars stolen, how much in the last two years? One million, two? A hundred?
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:01:38
I'm sorry but BTC is a theives paradise.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:20:21
I'm not denying that. What is the total value of btc compared to the total value of USD deposits in banks... relatively speaking, that was stolen these last 18 months?  I have no idea.
I love the concept of btc I really do, fuck the banks.  But whether btc as a technology is flawed or the network infrastructure it uses is flawed the bottom line is that it is easy to steal btc.
