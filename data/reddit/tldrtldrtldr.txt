Buffet has done extremely well without speculating and taking excessive risks. Bitcoin at this stage is **an extremely risky investment**. So, he's not wrong in advising against it. Like a new trend, it can either fail miserably or reward beyond comprehension. But it's definitely not for investment.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:12:03
Yeah. I am pretty sure at this point. People won't mind taking haircut of 50%. There are people on Reddit itself who have coins there in thousands. 
But I don't think they will declare bankruptcy. Specially in wake of their persistent 'hang on', 'we are fixing it' pointers. That will be a sureshot way to goto jail and getting pulled in lawsuits. So they will be bought and their books will have to be cleaned.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:09:05
They also reported that all BTCs at Gox are safe, only to pull down that article later.

Why would MK buy gox.com on 25 Feb if he was filing for bankruptcy? I think broader BTC players have all sold and want market volatility to continue to buy back in. This is all fear-mongering.

Don't give them ideas for a good excuse.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:46:07
Yeah, that was the reaction of many people when BTC tanked yesterday. Let's talk once all the smoke settles down. It's all speculation right now.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:33:07
At this point I am beginning to think that this is all smoke screen. MtGox has lost coins but nowhere near 700k+. This FUD is only benefiting people who wanted to enter massively into BTC. Give this thing a month and let whole picture come out. Do note
1. They have not disappeared or made attempt for that
2. Their site is not returning 404, twitter is not deleted, FB page is still up
3. There still are employees (I heard) in one IRC channel
Seems like a good chance that they will be able to turn things around.
@_date: 2014-02-23 10:31:29
The problem with this is by the time remittance is complete price of BTC may go down. Sure, it can go up as well. But that's like gambling. Until BTC gets a solid floor, be it 100, 500 or 10000 or someone on the other side of remittance is willing to provide the same rate, no matter what; this won't be acceptable.
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:41:04
Of what? Give me example on one crypto which rises as compared to BTC in long run. They all fall. Each one of them.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:12:25
Yeah, someone found a screenshot of a spreadsheet and tracked down the coins from those addresses. This is a total scam. MtGox has all the coins.

It's a legitimate question. Why is this being downvoted? As much as I like Bitcoin, I am surprised by intolerance to questions/alternative views here.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:01:24
Just like the recent adopters? Only difference is they got it cheap and made lots of money. No need to be envy of their success.
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:34:15
That's fair point. I have seen lots of stealing and runaways. But can't say that entire experiment was a failure because of some bad apples.
@_date: 2014-12-26 19:25:05
Fair point. But a lot many people entered at $100 and above. That's why I said, it's a solid base. Not a limit beyond which BTC can't fall.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:22:02
Not sure who downvoted you. Considering recent threads about Tibanne being in court in 2013 and MK being in fraud case before Japan, why rule out possibility of foul play. 
And yes, if he's found to cause this intentionally or has benefited from the mishap. His personal wealth will be plundered.

My understanding about shorting is that you borrow stocks (or instruments) that you don't own. Otherwise, it's selling high and buying low not shorting.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:16:15
Let's have a chat about this again once dust from MtGox settles down. Bitcoin solves more problems than it creates. I think in short term it will go down, which is good for the stability of the price. I am actually happy if it stays at 800 (or whatever number) forever and matches only yearly inflation of USD or any other fiat. So, my reason to hold it are not to get rich quick or get rich crazy.

Then it's more a matter of financial regulations. As BTC solves this problem quite beautifully.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:14:55
In all likelihood, MtGox screwed up on last crash. They traded with BTCs of other people and lost lots of money. That's why 20% premium (they are saying nobody should buy from here) and now the crash. Pure manipulation.
It all blew up when someone decided to fly to their office and drew attention of wider community. Irrespective of what happen, they will be out of business and under lawsuits.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:29:25
Only sensible comment here. Isn't MtGox lawyer suppose to release a report today. We will see.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:35:20

To give you some perspective

@_date: 2014-03-01 14:30:41
Don't be under any kind of delusion if you think around 100k early adopters losing their money is a good thing. They were the people who spread information about Bitcoins. Community meetups, events. No way, they losing money is good for anyone or Bitcoin as whole. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:39:37
You already have some, don't you? Let's all see what this is for a scam.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:40:50
I think price will crash and there will be lots of bad publicity, keeping newcomers away. I will be buying.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:13:17
You know how stock market shorting works right? That's not how it can happen for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:57:36
But that's every system. It rewards early adopters because they believed in it. What if BTC was $1 today. Won't you be laughing at the people who spent so much time talking about it. Creating wallets, exchanges etc. If they took the risk of being ridiculed they surely deservers the riches now.
Also, about market manipulation. If you are 20+, you must have seen multiple boom and bust cycles. So yeah, that's possible. But is the solution to distribute all the coins equally? How do you think that don't remain the case?
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:35:01
They are also dead as a business. And will likely be under lawsuits. I think the fat CEO saw Wolf of Wall Street and decided to live some fantasy.

No comment about acq here.
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:29:47
Only one downside with hoarding. Bitcoin's real strength is miners. Which lend great value, integrity and security to the network. Holding onto Bitcoins is not the right strategy. If all the early miners had held onto their Bitcoins thinking they will only sell when prices reaches $1000 there had been no Bitcoin economy. No exchanges.
But moreover, without transactions there will be no miner nodes and hence no network. Holding onto Bitcoins is detrimental to its value.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:04:45
If Bitcoin is pyramid scheme than what is cash? That's how it works in my understanding
1. A sovereign entity raises huge amount from central bank at very low rate. It can be funded by other countries and investors
2. That cash is put in banks and a interest higher than interest in step 1 is paid if it is kept in fixed term
3. Banks give it to businesses at higher interest rate
4. Businesses and consumers can put the money in bank at a interest rate which would always be far lower than inflation
Who gains?
Everyone who create services, products gets cashflow towards them. Same is the story with BTC. Did Bitstamp, Satoshidice etc mined it all? They must be having BTCs in 100 thousands. Want BTC and don't want to pay for it? Create a game or a product or a service which solves some problem using it.
Actually, BTC in that regard is no different from any real world currency. A local currency appreciates when people from other nations buy goods from that country. The reason BTC is so volatile is not because it's deflationary because services around it are so few. Any new addition increases the market reach rapidly in percentage terms.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:35:44
Do you see a warning by Blockchain that "Warning! this bitcoin address contains transactions which may be double spends. You should be extremely careful when trusting any transactions to or from this address."
Crap! So they did lose coins!
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:53:25
I am down voting this because I don't think assassination is an option. Scam or not, this shouldn't even be asked.
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:11:06
But they will have to convert btc into fiat to buy goods, may be some assets (atleast for now). What if some weed seller amass say 1000 BTC, won't they want to buy some property with that may be. At that stage they will have to enter the banking system, and they will again be denied. To me it seems, adopting BTC will lead to problems down the road for them.
Edit: There's a bullion seller accepting BTC now. Is there a property conglomerate doing this?
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:23:33
I don't think Blockchain can take such volume as Visa etc. Current limit is 43 per second? Although it seems ready to takeover Paypal and Ebay. Being a counter to Paypal is what Bitcoin should be.

At this stage MK is essentially trying to sell Gox at 500 million USD to customers. Yeah, with so much missing piece of information and no and misguiding words from him, I too now sticking to the theory that coins are under his control.
Think about it. Gox was done for. No one would had done any business with them as soon as they had allowed the withdrawals, it had been a bank run.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:36:01
I am sorry you face backlash from the community. I can only once again give you an example to share my viewpoint. You must have heard about Facebook's recent purchase of Whatsapp. 19 billion USD. It was invested at 80 million valuation three years back by Sequoia Capital. That's &gt; 200 times increase. Is it a scam? It's last round was in September last year and it was valued at ~2 billion. Still Facebook paid 10x that price. 
About someone buying in now being at a disadvantage is true only if you keep on thinking about people who got in early. Should Facebook had invested in Whatsapp in 2011? Bitcoin had been a laughing stock for years. And people want to get in now when it has governments and large private investors, newspapers, VCs etc talking about it. So obviously, newcomers be at a disadvantage. 
Up until last year this time. That's only 365 days. There were exchanges and even LBC around. How many bought? How many believed? It's not fair to call it a scam just because early adopters are at an advantage. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:12:17

It was postulated that he pulled down the site after the document was leaked as now he won't be able to negotiate. But if he was reported to authorities earlier, then that can't be the reason to pull down the site.

It's actually a fair question and get asked around a lot. Let me put it this way. Suppose there was a swamp and nobody was willing to go there. Few people risked their time and energy and decided to visit this place. They settled there, created some initial maps, information about the place. And have taken property there.
Then suddenly, more people found out about this place. That it actually got great views. But people who settled earlier definitely would have more land and better views. And latecomers will have to either pay for it or create products which can get them money to pay for it.
Know any city where this happened? I know plenty.

@_date: 2014-03-01 14:19:26
The time. No exchange allows instant withdrawals of BTC. That's why prices were hugely different at Gox as compared to other exchanges. Current two big exchanges, BTC-E and Stamp has small difference but you are taking a risk with BTC-E as their owners are not known.

@_date: 2014-02-16 13:22:13
They are betting that MtGox has no BTCs but there's a chance to recover the fiat by lawsuits as that will have legitimacy in court. Right course was for MtGox to transfer funds in a wallet so everyone can see they are solvent on Blockchain. And since they had been wishy washy about it, it's creating all the uncertainty.

That's not entirely true. Banks take almost 2-3 days for intra country transfer. Also if transfer is between another bank (or a non partner bank), time can be even higher.
Don't know how western union works though. But if it's in person collection i.e. no bank involved. Then it should be faster I guess. But generally wire transfers take 10 days.
Edit: In case, you are saying that funds would be sent in Bitcoin. Yes, that be instant. But other side should be willing to accept the current BTC price as binding (or sell BTC immediately into local currency)

Are you really that naive that I have to spoon feed to you what I am asking? People upvoting are not doing this because of some new great innovation in crypto space but because they got economic advantage from this. Coin was launched in January, already being traded on Cryptsy. At this point, it's make noise to pump the value and that's the incentive for upvotes.

How so? SR1 wallet had ~100000 BTCs. This amount does seem minuscule as compared to that. Also, 2.3 million is like 0.03% of current market cap. May be a huge sum for some but not so huge to create an issue.
Edit: Judging by the volume on Bitstamp it already has absorbed more coins on the selling side since the news broke out. So, again this is nothing.

Why leak that document and even prepare it if he was filing for bankruptcy? At the leak time it was said that he is talking to potential buyers. So he wasn't filing for bankruptcy? Twobit's leak was on Tuesday btw.
In fact it was postulated that he took down the site because now he can't sell it to the buyers. He can't be pitching to the buyers and filing for bankruptcy at the same time.

Field is never going to be level playing. Let's play your scenario. Bitcoin becomes $1 by tomorrow and in that chaos and noise everyone in the world learns about cryptos. Since regulations are already on the wheels, a new crypto currency is launched. How do you think field would be level playing? You think you can mine in your basement now and have early advantage?
No. Governments will take the first cut. They will have humongous quantities before this ever becomes a reality. And as soon as it does. Large corporations will have far more firepower than you can ever imagine. So they will scoop the latter coins.

You are right about some people might not be happy with any haircut arrangement. If I have to speculate such a scenario. I would say, they will just make it optional for users to withdraw 50% now and agree to take 50% haircut. Rest who don't agree will have to wait until things are turned around. So they will become investors of sorts. In case things do turn around, they get 100%. None, otherwise.
Or they may choose to allow everyone to take 50% now and rest when things turnaround (if they turnaround). I think people be mighty happy with this.

This is great development alright but real story here is number of people at fiverr willing to withdraw in bitcoin as well (see comments). Why? Because that frees them from paypal, currency conversions etc. And that's the real problem that Bitcoin can solve. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:54:03
In a way it is. Specially because it's still early. I do think however, that eventually it will settle to modest anti inflation rate to the local currency. So if inflation is 10% in currency X, BTC will rise by 10% against it. If it's 2% for Y, BTC will rise by 2% against it. But that's also considering it becomes globally acceptable and used widely. Until that happens it will have both spikes and busts. And yeah, **it can surely go back to $10** if there's no adoption increase or it just cease to solve any problem. But that's the risk you are taking and that's why you also deserve the reward.

Let me simplify the situation for you and others. Let's say there are three people in a room A, B, C. A sells bananas, B oranges, C Potatoes.
They all sell goods to each other. A owes $100 to B for his goods, B owes $100 to A for his goods and similar stuff between A and C and B and C.
For someone looking at their debt numbers, it will look that all three of them are $200 in debt. Collectively they are $600 in debt. This is wrong deduction and missing the fact that they have exchanged goods with each other. 
Debts between countries have similar business deals. Much more complex, but similar. They are not collectively in debt as sum total.

Thank you. But I am still not clear on this. From what I have read, block discoverer is to receive the transaction fee perpetually, on every transaction for which transaction fee becomes a necessity. Does the pool preserve this information and even later keep on dividing the bitcoins generated in transaction fee to the users. I doubt that happens. It be very tough to track it for all miners in the pool. So does the original discoverer accumulates those bitcoins or pool?

Most consumption is driven by the rich not poor. Rich does become poor within few generations and cycle repeats. For you to refer to 80% and 20% as some sort of constant is a misdirection. Were you born rich? Will your children be rich and their children? All classes go in both directions.

Talking about ponzi, this is not the incentive on which a ponzi operates
How else do you think bitcoin should move forward? It is open in the sense there's a community which can provide feedback, have a say and are users. The source code and specs are open. Someone can fork the source code and create their own coin and many have. That's how an open source project works and for bitcoin that's the right step. You don't really think that everyone should be able to commit to the repo?
Heard of Linux OS?
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:47:02
I am confused about people calling bitcoin ponzi just because there are some people who got in early and are rewarded exponentially for their belief and efforts.
* You realize early twitter users had insane amount of followers as twitter start growing. Is twitter a ponzi?
* Google stock. Or any for that matter. ponzi?
* How about holding land or apartment in a city? ponzi right?
This is how I understand a ponzi works. New adopters pay previous adopters and so on, like a pyramid scheme. There's no other incentive, utility or growth of such a system. Bitcoin is nowhere near this definition. It can and already is solving lots of interesting problems and it has potential in lots of areas which people haven't thought about (same as a technology stock but instead of a private company, bitcoin is a protocol). Still think it's a ponzi?

At current rate and size of unconfirmed transactions, such a large scale adoption will make buying a loaf of bread one year endeavour.

Okay, this is the simple, killer app that can take Bitcoin far. I really like the idea. Let's see how execution goes.

No. This is not true. Before it creates a big circlejerk here, let me clarify. It's only SBI who charges such fee and created agent culture of sorts. By law no fee should be charged. And if you have argued they had to back down (my father did that). Real reason is
1. Banks want to offload the traffic of depositors (high population, ATMs can't accept cash as deposits yet)
2. They created satellite offices to collect deposits and encourage people to deposit there only
3. These satellite offices (more like agents) take deposits and charges fee. They also likely give kickbacks (bribes) to bank officials and therefore bank employees encourage using them.
