What's your point? Buffett makes his first ever price prediction about crypto, saying that he would "buy puts on the cryptocurrencies," and within 7 days cryptos subsequently have their biggest crash in years(measured in distance from ATH). It's pretty good timing. Could be complete luck of course, but with Buffett it's usually not complete luck.

It's base money bro. Base money is most analogous, to BTC and also the easiest to quantify... 
Brief explanation of base money:
Physical Dollar bills are base money. So are deposits that banks have at the fed, that they loan against. Base money means guaranteed directly by the fed and not by any intermediary. 
Since only 7% of base money is in physical dollars(which are a little hard to quantify), this total supply is very easy to quantify -- since 93% of base money is just a number on a computer at the federal reserve.

Watch the speed of the moves, get behind fast moves. If BTC is rising faster than it falls(ie traceback takes X times as long) that's bullish. Faster falls than rises are bearish.

Maybe you know more about the technical aspects, then. But on the other hand, I don't think being an expert on gold mining makes a person able to understand whether gold as a monetary system is better than a fiat system. That question requires an economic expert to answer rather than a geology expert. Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon are the best at what they do, objectively, and it's not at all fair to compare them to hacks like Krugman.

You're mistaken. Modern economists do agree that an increase in the money supply will lead to higher prices over time; there is a very strong correlation and it is not controversial. But the money supply is not the full picture-- inflation is also driven by the velocity of money, which is driven by credit, consumer confidence, etc. making "money supply" not actually a very good measure of inflation over the short term.
Or to put it a different way, why, if the money supply remained constant, and the production rate of real goods and services decreased, did deflation occur so dramatically in 1929? The answer is that there was a collapse of credit in the economy, and credit can be thought of as a form of money, in that it directs spending, even though it is not part of the money supply.
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:46:13
An interesting argument but not the best way to think about it. Bitcoin is said to be deflationary solely on supply and demand. As # of dollars increase while # of BTC stay the same, a BTC should buy more dollars over time. Mining costs don't really factor in. But, your argument is very interesting and I need to think more about it.

Krugman is an academic and a guy who gets paid to write incendiary flaming Leninist-Marxist op-eds that the "intellectuals" eat up like potato chips. He has no "skin in the game." Dimon is a professional who has worked in finance for decades, and been the CEO of one of the world's largest banks for 12 years. I do think he knows more about finance and financial instruments than you. I daresay he knows more about blockchain than you -- Like all the major banks, JP Morgan is experimenting with blockchain-- it's his job to know these things. As I said, I'm not agreeing with him-- my only point is that if one of the world's foremost experts disagrees with you(and not just Dimon; Warren Buffett too, actually almost any financial expert), then you should at least accept that the answer is not clear-cut.

Jamie Dimon, one of the world's foremost experts on all things financial, and a hell of a lot more knowledgeable than anybody on this sub will tell you emphatically "no."
I'm not saying he's right, or they're right, but if you're going to buy Bitcoin, dollar cost average and keep it to a small percentage of your portfolio. When I first bought Bitcoin, this sub was not nearly as bullish on Bitcoin as it is today. That could mean we are in a bubble. Or maybe it means that Bitcoin is finally getting the love it deserves. Or both. Nobody knows for sure. My personal opinion is that when you have this many new speculators in the market, many of them are going to buy at the peak and then sell when the market tanks and some of them will lose a lot of money, and that's unfortunate. Then again, maybe Bitcoin goes up another 5x before that happens.

I agree with the spirit of what you are saying.
But, that is not an accurate portrayal of expert opinion. Economists do agree that productivity is essentially the single long term driver of economic growth. The stated purpose of the central bank, is not, as you seem to think, to make the economy grow faster, but to "moderate" its growth; to smooth out the booms and busts. If the crash is less bad, then fewer people are laid off, fewer businesses have to shut down, etc. 
I suggest you take a look at [How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio]( It's his job to understand how these things work, and he uses this knowledge to make billions and billions of dollars, so I think it's worth giving this perspective a shot.

But I wasn't trying to make a bearish statement with this post, actually the opposite.
What I can tell you from my personal experience with hodl is that it is a form of self-deception, a willing blindness to logic and reason.

The other hodlers do deny

Stock indexing doesn't always beat active trading, but it's still a much better strategy for 99% of people. It is much less stressful and much easier to do. And it works better on average. I believe the same about hodl vs. timing the market.

"Doublethink lies at the very heart of Hodl, since the essential act of r/Bitcoin is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies-- all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word *doublethink* it is necessary to exercise *doublethink.* For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of *doublethink* one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always ahead of the truth."

Both. I hodled until I didn't. 
I'm still a huge bull though for the long term, and being a Bitcoin bull means ignoring certain tricky questions by eloquent well-spoken people.

Seeing as that was during the hype of the bubble and we never reached $40,000 let alone $400,000, I'm gonna say no, that was not some genius prediction.
We WILL get there but TIMING is a part of prediction

You can't buy Bitcoin on the Cash App, you can only buy a promissory note.

If someone steals your key do they own your house? No, because the deed IS ownership. 
With Bitcoin ownership IS key ownership, and the legal details are secondary. 
By owning Bitcoin by means of a deed, you are combining the risks of legal ownership with the risks of crypto and getting the benefits of neither.

Anyone else see the pattern that Bitcoin ONLY GOES UP except occasionally it drops a little for 1-2 years?

Paper wallets cannot spend and receive from the same wallet securely, which makes them much less convenient. They also are also just more difficult because to have a safe paper wallet you have to generate and print the keys completely offline, which is doable but not practical for most people. 
One thing I did with paper wallets in the past was give Bitcoin as a gift to family; for that purpose it's not bad. But that is probably one of the few uses where it makes more sense than a hardware wallet. (I also stored my own Bitcoin on paper wallets-- technically this was not safe, but it worked out OK for me)

good question. It's because when bitcoin was crashing in early 2018 I remembered that it was exactly 4 years since the last time it had gone down on me. And I thought "why?" And one possible explanation is: Because the block reward size halves every 4 years and this correlation is not an accident but is based on fundamental forces. So here I am exploring this possibility mathematically. (It doesn't NEED to have a theory behind why it's 4 years and not some other number-- the trend is quite convincing. The fact that Bitcoin supply changes drastically every 4 years is just icing on the cake. )
Since then, in my opinion, history has borne out the prediction very well-- it has been shown to be mathematically valid, and I am pleased with my decisions that I have based on it.
Edit: Block reward size, not blocksize

No because cash is FDIC insured and legally protected. Dollars are secured by the fact that illicit transactions can usually just be reversed. When Bitcoin is stolen, however, there is no way of getting it back. Your dollars kept on Square are significantly safer than your Bitcoin kept there.
The whole benefit of Bitcoin is that it is an ownership mechanism that bypasses centralized instutitions, but when you keep your Bitcoin with a centralized institution you are getting all of the risks of centralized institutions plus all of the risks associated with Bitcoin(namely that stolen Bitcoin are unrecoverable).


Sure that's very possible, but the Bitcoins can still be stolen from Square's Bitcoin vaults. Your account may be secure but the actual assets themselves can still be stolen.

Trezor has been around for many years. Had they wanted to do an exit scam, they would have done so long ago.

$0-$50,000 of volume is charged at .16% for maker and .26% for taker, so it's significantly lower than 1% even for small amounts.
Edit: Looking at the bid/ask spread now, it is very low and does not offset these low fees. Conclusion is that charging 1% is basically a scam.

70%, drops to 60% when only considering the last 15 months.
