They'll be tumbled so damn much there won't be any tracking them.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:30:12
Also add: How could this have been avoided?
By keeping your btc in wallets and not on exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:04:33
Build yours however you want. This one is built for demonstration.

GUI mining has been obsolete for awhile. 
Anyone with a GUI rig mines alt currencies which are still profitable. 
BTC miners use ASIC rigs which can only mine BTC and they're worthless if BTC shits the bed.

gox blew smoke too. 
I wish for the best but we have to consider the trend. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:09:17
No. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:27:40
Who the hell is downvoting this? I went through 8 hours of new posts and no one else mentioned this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:37:54
I haven't tried logging in for a week or so, so this is news to me.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:37:51
Don't listen to him, it was solid and good info, even pasted their maintenance message. I'm glad you posted this and happy to see that it's gaining traction now. 
I mean heaven fucking forbid a guy fails to use proper English occasionally. 
It's the news that mattered. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:10:26
9 out of 10 people writing about it know nothing about bitcoin.

Turmoil? Not quite.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:56:15
[He seems like a reasonable guy to help resolve this situation.](
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:13:07
He probably thought it was real physical coins.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:27:54
It's bad enough as it is, but if it comes out that this was all completely intentional, holy shit, there isn't a country out there that would take him in.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:25:34
Wow. First I've heard of it. Great job.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:05:34
Let's not circlejerk this place up.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:14:27
Not when he thinks he can raise your premiums.
Then if you ever try to file a claim on it, it's a simple "oh well oops I guess I misunderstood, welp you're fucked haha"
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:11:31
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:27:25
Yeah, you can easily still make money, not fuck anyone over, and also revolutionize the world.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:40:56
I have an uncle who owns a mechanic's shop. He'll fuck anyone over and then brag and laugh about it. 
If he's trolling he's trolling, but some guys really fucking suck.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:25:33
Oh for fucksake this again
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:55:10
He's just talking out of his ass.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:24:29
I'm pretty sure just by adding up some of the new posts in this subreddit where people are saying how much they've lost, you could easily add up to 200k.
So you might be surprised.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:19:45
Some people have just been posting about how sketchy BTCe is.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:51:28
So far it's looking like he's getting away pretty easily. 
I think everyone is waiting on everyone else to do something, so no one is going to do anything.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:24:28
What the actual fuck
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:08:34
That's it, I'm going to subscribe to @_date: 2014-02-26 03:30:36
What the fuck is up with these posts?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:35:11
It's the exchange I use for XPM to BTC then BTC out to my wallet. I don't keep funds in there for long, so I haven't lost anything.
I haven't mined XPM in awhile though and irresponsibility when I did I had the pool move straight into crypto-trade. I plan on mining XPM again soon, will have to change that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:40:17
So now all a a guy needs to use stolen credit cards to buy bitcoins is a fake Facebook account.
Plus, as someone who might actually use your service, the fact that you require my Facebook is a deal breaker. My Facebook is private and has about 10 family and friends on it. I wish I didn't have to have it but I must simply because they use it and I'd like to stay in touch. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:13:22
People kept their coins on a website that lets you exchange them into other currencies.
You should really keep them in a bitcoin wallet instead.
The people who used mt-gox as a wallet are the ones who lost the most.
Mt-gox shut down and now no one can get their coins out of it.
There is a good possibility that the coins are gone forever, stolen or lost, who knows, more news will come out over the next few days.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:31:24
You're a cancer to bitcoin as a hole.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:32:25
He said it was 8 days ago in the post, and I've seen this picture posted earlier today so I didn't bother to look at it again.
Either way, okay so it was only yesterday, I still think they could update more often.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:18:33
That was 8 days ago man. 
With the shit that's been going on they should be updating everyone with quality updates at least 3 times a day.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:18:29
assassinated? come on. 
killing someone is never the answer to anything. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:27:15
The world is watching this subreddit right now. Shut the fuck up.
It's a constant fight to earn respect as it is.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:51:35
Any advice for other people who have lost? A lot of people still haven't found out what happened today.
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:02:25
I have really got to install some alerts when the market moves that rapidly. I slept through the whole thing.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:01:44
I don't see anything close to their logo. Of course I'm mobile maybe it's different but logos usually stay the same. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:31:09
I have a feeling it's been tumbled so much that it would take a quality script to follow it, if it's even possible then.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:37:56
Link? Just curious.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:15:20
