It's common with things that grow or shrink exponentially because of compounding, like econojavascript:void(0)mic growth, a business's reinvested profits, or your student loan debt if you don't make payments against the principal.
Bitcoin on the other hand is more or less pure speculation. You can use the charts to figure out rates of "stable" growth for it, but all it's really telling you is about the constitutions and sensibilities of other speculators. If most of them are looking at the linear chart, you probably should too, since this game is all about playing the psychology of fellow speculators. Bitcoin has no earnings, R&amp;D, assets, or holdings to speak of. The only thing that actually compounds with Bitcoin is the emotional hype or panic, hence the massive volatility. There is no firm or capital backing its valuations, rather just pure belief either in some prophesied mass adoption or in there being profitability in its short-term volatility.

It does slightly more than smooth. You end up buying more of the asset when prices are low and less when prices are high, but this is true of all purchasing in a sense, and it's a marginal difference at best anyway.
I endorse DCA more because it encourages a patient, regular, stable mindset rather than an erratic, emotional one that tries to time the market.  TBQH that alone can make a huge difference for most people, but it's about psychology, not math.

It's not at all neutral or apolitical. A very particular political ideology is baked right into its design specifications. One where inherently deflationary currency is a good thing, and any kind of control over our own currency, even democratic, is bad and to be avoided. These are extremely political and un-neutral convictions which are baked right into bitcoin itself. 
By prescribing it as "the medicine you need" on the basis of its supposedly neutral, apolitical-ness,  Ammous is demonstrating just how deeply and hopelessly consumed he is by his own ideology, so much so that he can't even see it anymore, like a fish trying to see water.

Almost nobody, because gold is deflationary in the long-term (nearly-fixed supply, increasing demand over time), and so the incentive is to save, not spend or invest.
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:30:59


It would! But then it'd be a very, very bad currency. That's all I've been trying to say, is that you can be one or the other, but not both. The question, though, is whether people will always demand bitcoin. A lot of demand right now is predicated on the belief that it'll become a mass-adopted currency. A belief that, by now, you understand is probably *not* correct. In other words, its an investment based on a mass delusion. So if people start to realize this, demand for bitcoin will fall, and it might not even be a good investment anymore.


Not quite.  The idea is that the point of a currency *is to make the economy work*, not make you rich in and of itself. The more currency moves, the more transactions occur, the more wealth is created. From a large scale perspective, money being saved might as well not exist, it's a chunk of the economy that's not being invested and not being consumed, like a worker at an assembly who's just sitting in a chair doing nothing, the whole line gets jammed up as a result. You might also think of the economy as a big machine, and currency is the lubricate that keeps all the pieces moving smoothly. It's not there to store value so much as *move* it, and keep it moving. Now, if it doesn't store value *at all*, that's no good, obviously, but ideally it stores value *just long enough* for you to spend or invest it, and the slowly decaying value encourages you to do that as quickly as possible.


No problem! Glad to help. The main problem I see with a lot of Bitcoin fanaticism is people being unable to separate the economics of their own wallet from the economics of a whole society. 
They're not the same thing, and while some things might sound good to your wallet in the short-sighted short-term ("you mean my money just gets more valuable on its own?"), it doesn't quite work on the large scale ("what do you mean I lost my job because the my company's investors decided to pull out their money and just save it instead?").  
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:16:09

Because some people want it to act like an investment, and gain value over time, and don't understand that *also* wanting it to act as a currency, which benefits from stable or slowly declining value, is having your cake and eating it too.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:15:27
That's impossible.
You can't have a growing economy, a fixed currency supply, and no deflation. A currency represents the value of goods and services in the economy, that's its function. If the volume of goods and services increases, but the amount of money stays constant, then each unit of currency will be exchangeable for a larger number of goods and services. 
You can look at it as the demand for money increasing as more people are trying to perform more transactions.
You can look at it as the supply of goods increasing and so their value drops, but that *manifests* as the currency's apparent value rising.
If Bitcoin actually becomes a mass-adopted currency, it **will** suffer deflation proportionate to economic growth. There is no getting around that. And because of that, any economy that relies on Bitcoin as its sole currency will be doomed to liquidity crises and recessions far worse than the US has ever seen under USD. Currency deflation discourages both investment (especially conservative, low-risk, low-ROI investment) and consumption, without which there is no economy to speak of.
I can maybe imagine scenarios where being deflationary wont be an issue, but it requires the economy to shrink, like uh...a slow depopulation of the planet? Or maybe a slow technological regression to primitive life? Neither sounds great.

@_date: 2018-12-11 20:51:55
The price on the charts is never zero, but if you can't find a buyer for more than zero, their value is effectively 0 as far as you're concerned.

You mean "in practice", not "in praxis". I know you think that word sounds smarter but you're just swapping it in where any normal person would use practice (especially in this case, where "practice" is the idiomatic norm), which might work on fellow stupid people but otherwise it kind of exposes you as a posturer.


Banks compete in a market with each other for borrowers' contracts. They charge the highest rate they can get away with and still capture market share, they don't just add up risk and inflation and offer that number. They start as high as they can and effectively negotiate down through competition. Inflation and risk (both of which can only be vaguely predicted over the course of a loan) eat away at the real value of those loans. Loans that aren't expected to pay off after that simply aren't offered at all. 
All of this is a red herring anyway, and does *exactly nothing* to challenge the fact that, if you are in debt, inflation is better for you than deflation, easily. Deflation is a good thing for people who *already have money*, and bad for everyone else, *especially* people who aren't independently wealthy and require a functioning, expanding economy in order to make a living (read: the vast majority of people). If a society that's deeply indebted already experiences currency deflation, it's only going to increase the rates of default and make it more difficult to loan money at all. Want to start a business? Tough shit, unless you can promise the bank a higher rate of growth than the deflation rate. In fact, pretty much all investments below the deflation rate suddenly become unattractive, and so will dry up. These lower-ROI investments tend to also be more conservative ones, meaning that a deflationary currency will make existing debts riskier, reduce the total pool of future investment, and increase the average riskiness of that remaining remaining pool. Same goes for consumers. Why spend your money today if you could get more for less tomorrow? 
So the second a recession hits, investors pull back from low-ROI investments because they can just let the currency value grow on its own. Investment pullback means lost jobs. Lost jobs means less spending by those consumers, which lowers the ROI on *more* businesses, which leads to *more* investment pullback, and repeat. As long as the currency remains deflationary, the recession will worsen, and worsen, and worsen.
The Bitcoiners' desire for deflation is pure, short-sighted stupidity. "A hyuck hyuck? You mean my money is worth more every day, sounds great hyuck hyuck! I can buy more pizza rolls and vidya games!" As soon as you start to think outside your wallet, to the broader economy, it becomes a little more obvious why the Fed *tries* to maintain 2-3% inflation, that it's not accidental, and that it's in fact a good thing for the economy that people be incentivized to spend or invest their money instead of hoard it.

Okay but maybe try to put your money on assets that are more on the "know" side of the spectrum.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:39:56


Rofl okay kid, let's dive in.


Ooo damn, that was a slick little bait and switch you pulled there. You're correct about currency, but here's the thing about investments: they're supposed to increase, not just hold, value. An investment should *at the very worst* be a value store, but the point of making an *investment* is to expect an *increase* in value over time. You imply as much here....


Do you know what we call it when people hold their currency for years on end, because they think it's a relatively solid investment? An economic depression. This is exactly why the Fed *aims* for moderate inflation, so that the currency itself encourages investment and spending (which creates returns for sellers, thus making investments profitable).
If your currency *deflates* at an expected 2% per year...that means pretty much all investments with an ROI of 2% or less are going to be left high and dry. So, some portion of investment dries up. All of that money is now out of the economy and under someone's mattress. 
On top of that, those 2% ROI investments were probably only attractive because of low risk. So, not only is the pool of investment smaller, but now the remaining investments are higher-risk on average. 
Oh, on top of this, people aren't spending as much either. So the ROI on most investments is going to dip as well, putting a lot more under that 2% line.
What part of this sounds like a good thing to you? Here's the facts: Bitcoin will never be a widely adopted currency, and if it somehow is, it will be short-lived, because any economy that adopts it will underperform (if not collapse) relative to those with some inflation.
Go down to the store, buy a cake. Take it home. Now eat it. Once you're done, return it to the store. Oh whoops. Difficult, right? That's what you're doing when you say Bitcoin is an investment and a currency at the same time.

It's a fucking awful analogy because you're not selling the wine, you're consuming it. For it to work as an analogy you have to pretend that spending = consuming. *Exchange* is taxed, not consumption. Consumption destroys a commodity and turns it into use-value (enjoyment). Selling converts the commodity into exchange-value (money). 
If you buy $10 worth of Yen and trade it for $20 worth of pizza, you get taxed for the $10 profit. 
If you buy $10 worth of stock and then trade it for $20 of pizza, you pay for the $10 profit. **This doesn't change if you simply call your stock 'currency'.**
Seriously, do you think it's that easy to get around paying taxes...just converting your currency to a non-USD one before spending it? Seriously? Enjoy your prison sentence.

Lmao what? Gold is the *quintessential* easy-to-break-down-and-recombine value store. 
Gold became an investment vehicle after the gold rushes finally ended after several centuries of exploration.  At that point, when you expect an asset to increase in price over time, the incentive switches to saving rather than spending or investing.

@_date: 2018-12-13 17:09:25


But why would you spend (or invest) it if you expect it to become more valuable over time? Good currencies facilitate and encourage transactions, without which neither labor nor investment are worthwhile, and thus encourage wealth creation. Investments, if they are *good* investments that can be expected to gain in value, discourage transaction once you're holding them. For a single thing to be both a currency *and* an investment is trying to have your cake and eat it too.
I mean, come on, think about it. The money in your wallet becomes worth more without you doing anything at all. You don't have to work, invest, create, nothing, just hold. You get something for nothing every day you wait, with no risk. In fact, *everyone* enjoys this as well. We all just get richer, whether we create wealth or not. Doesn't that sound just a *little* bit too good to be true? It's more complicated, and in fact contradictory, than you've been lead to believe.


Trying to talk some sense into you guys and passing the time. I'm not saying Bitcoin is going to crash or soar, but that its value is predicated on delusional belief. You can bet on crash or soar based on whether you expect that delusion to spread or die out, definitely, and make money trading Bitcoin that way, but betting on delusions being true is never a good idea when it comes to playing market psychology. You might find it easier to make that bet if you understand why it's delusional.

It doesn't matter what something is *designed* to be. If you buy something with USD and then exchange it later for something of greater value, you are collecting capital gains.
Exchanges which are profitable are to be valued in dollars and taxed on the basis of the profit gained thereof. If you buy a stock for $10 and then sell it for $20, you pay tax on the $10 profit. If you buy a stock for $10 and then exchange it for a pizza with a dollar value of $20, you get taxed on the $10 profit. **Calling your stock 'a currency' wont change this**. 
If it was that simple to avoid taxes, every corporation in America would just use another currency to do exchanges, and pay zero taxes. Hell, they could use a dollar-pegged currency like the Jordanian dinar, so there wouldn't be any change to the numbers involved. 


Uh, what capital gains? You didn't sell it for a profit, you consumed it for personal pleasure. Eating is not analogous to exchanging. There was no exchange here to tax.


You're trying to equate consumption with exchange, so by this incredibly stupid logic you could call *all* exchange "personal use" and tax nothing, ever.


Again, the Yen is also money, but if I use exhange rates as a sly way to profit, I get taxed on the profit. 
Taxing the implicit profit in a bitcoin sale isn't bullshit, it's making bitcoin play by the same rules as all other assets and currencies.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:44:11


The more prices rise, the less people will want to actually use it.  People tend to hold onto things they expect to gain value, hence why we spend or invest our dollars instead of burying them in the backyard. 
Bitcoin fans: You have to decide if you want Bitcoin to be an investment or a currency. It cannot be both at the same time. The qualities that make it attractive as one make it unattractive as the other, and vice versa.

So what you're saying is that a logarithmic chart makes *one particular set of analysis* easier to see immediately. That's not the same thing as having more information. 
If, for example, I wanted to find out how often bitcoin's price doubled within a year's span, a linear chart would avail that to my eyes with much less effort, as would any linear question. Linear charts answer linear questions, logarithmic charts answer exponential questions.
Both charts have the same information, which one is more useful depends on what analysis you're trying to perform.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:10:46


*And* all investing with a lower ROI than the rate of deflation, so it basically forces modest and conservative investors to either sit on their currency *or* engage in riskier investments than they would otherwise. So the tendency will be a reduction in investment, and the remaining investment becomes riskier on average. Oh, and people will also be spending less, so ROI on investments that rely on disposable income spending will suffer too.

No, I reasoned it myself from pretty basic facts. Wealth and jobs are created by commerce, the exchange of goods and services. The more that is exchanged, and the more quickly, the more wealth and jobs are created. 
A deflationary currency encourages saving, right? That means it's discouraging spending and investment. Ask yourself which thing you think creates more wealth: everyone hiding their money under the bed **or** everybody spending and/or investing the money. Hint: the latter. By spending money, you are generating the ROI for an investor somewhere. They only funded a business because of the expectation of that ROI. The only reason you have a job is because an investor thinks he can get an ROI on your labor by selling the product you create. Investment activates labor, labor creates goods and services, goods and services attract spending, spending justifies investment. Notice something about that circuit? Savings doesn't appear anywhere in it.


Banks hold large amounts of money and promises to pay money (ie. loans they make to businesses and individuals). When you have lots of money and entitlements to debts (like a bank does) then deflation means your assets become more valuable on their own. Deflation is great for people *with lots of money already* and shitty for everyone who has to actually work for a living.


Seriously man, read this over. You think that simply having a different kind of currency will make *everyone* get more rich *simultaneously*, regardless of whether or not they actually create any wealth? Free lunches for everyone, we all become billionaires without doing any work at all. That doesn't sound just a teensy bit too good to be true, a teensy bit like having your cake and eating it too?


The only reason you get a paycheck is because someone *else* spent money on the good or service you create at your job. An economy is a circular circuit, not a straight line. We have a phrase for what happens when everyone saves their money: economic depression.

How do you think businesses make money and employ people and expand? How do you think literally anyone gets a paycheck to save in the first place?

Every paycheck that a worker gets, or dividend that a shareholder gets, begins with a consumer, *somewhere* spending.

Absolutely not, I'm afraid you're being a bit naive. Bitcoin is designed almost exactly to meet the wishes of Austrian-School-type libertarians who hate inflation, central banking, and any monetary policy that isn't "set it and forget it". There is no appeal whatsoever to anyone left of center who desires democratic input into monetary policy (aka all of the left and most of the center too). It fits extremely neatly in the existing, neatly drawn box lines, there is nothing unconventional or transcendent about it. It is appealing strictly to a particular right wing heterodox school of economics.
The only sense in which it's not "political" is that once it's set in motion it cannot be subject to politics *afterwards*. So it's basically equivalent to a libertarian-designed economic policy which ends with, "This policy cannot be overturned or changed by anyone, ever again."

Also try comparing [this graph]( to [this list]( I know it's a lot to look at, the US was pretty much just one, long series of deflationary banking crises for the entire 19th century...but at the very least, remember this graph of swings and list of crises next time someone tells you things were stable and prosperous back in the days of the gold standard.


Not even the last BTC. As long as bitcoins are being mined at a rate slower than the increase in demand for them (which will be more, the more people adopt it) it will be deflationary. Deflation is just a price increase in something, and it can be caused either by a relative increase in demand or a decrease in supply. So, as long as demand for bitcoin grows faster than supply of bitcoin, it will deflate.


They're more like ovens and refrigerators. Very similar things, but not exactly interchangeable.
Good investments are bad currencies, and good currencies are bad investments. Hence why "Is Bitcoin an investment or a currency?" is a really important question, and the difficult people have answering it does not bode well for its future (depending on what future you're hoping for).

How did you determine these?

I never once disagreed that inflation and interest rates are *linked*. Simply that inflation increasing is good for existing debtors, and inflation decreasing (or becoming deflation) is bad for them.

A steady 2% inflation is the definition of stable. Again, try comparing to [the past few centuries]( It's also instructive to review [the history of banking crises]( and compare the 19th and 20th centuries in the US. Spoiler: The 19th century had a banking crisis in the US nearly every single decade. 
Inflation is only a bad thing for someone who saves. If you spend or invest, it doesn't affect you at all. Economy wide, inflation encourages spending and investment, which together are how growth and wealth creation occur. **The only reason you have a paycheck to save in the first place is because other people invested or spent their money.** Savers are free riders in a sense, because the security they gain for themselves comes at the cost of slowing economic growth overall. 
Re: capitalism, you're blinded by ideology and chasing a fantasy capitalism that has never and will never exist.

Isn't that the point of the ledger, and having a police force that enforces contracts? Are you guys against enforcing contracts? If so, is private property out the window too?


Why would people ever spend or invest money if they'd gain value just by putting it under the bed?

What's bullshit about it...?
If I bought a stock, held it, then sold it to buy a Pizza, I'd have to pay a tax on the profit from that stock holding. Bitcoin's no different. If I bought a bunch of Japanese Yen, held them, then sold them for USD to buy a Pizza, I'd pay the tax on the profit then too.

Again, it depends entirely on what metrics or qualities you're trying to understand.

It will *never* be viable as a currency because it's *inherently* deflationary. Limited supply, and like all currencies in growing economies, increasing demand. 


Even without volatility, deflation is bad news for a currency because it encourages hoarding and discourages spending and investment, which drive the economy.

It's only inflationary if the rate of supply increase outpaces the rate of demand increase. You can't prove it's inflationary simply by pointing out that the number of them grows. That's only half of the equation. You said yourself that rate of supply increase will halve every 210,000 blocks. Will the rate of *demand* increase halve every 210,000 blocks too? If the answer is no, then deflation will kick in much earlier than 2140, if it's not already a reality now. 
And, again, you didn't answer my question. What happens to the price of something when its supply is fixed and demand increases?
Answer me that (hint: deflation) and I'll explain why deflation sounds nice if you only think about your own wallet in a vacuum but is awful if you consider the economy as a whole (that thing you wallet is *actually* in, rather than a vacuum).

I don't think you're disagreeing with him, you're basically restating his implication which is that bitcoin's prophesied mass adoption as a currency is intrinsically contradictory.
