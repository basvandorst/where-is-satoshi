Bitcoin is a hedge against hyperinflation

Does this use the bitcrystals that spells of genesis uses?

 Shows how early are,  still really almost alpha testing. But also how much profits are still to be made.

Maybe its a dumb question, but when cloud mining at viabtc.com, can you withdraw your funds if and when you want to discontinue the contract?  I sent a small test amout there but see no withdraw button. If they keep it, is our contract a lifetime policy (or until mining is completed)?  I've searched for this anwer but cannot find it.  Thanks!

Additionally we could use quantum computer to make stronger encryption? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:50:00
have them on jaxx(or any wallet that does seed words) then delete the app.  When you arrive reinstall and activate with your seed words.   Keep the words safe - maybe encrypted in your email?  Renaming your wallet.dat file is a really good idea too

Yup, its called evolution.

People are hedging their bets, which is smart.  I used to believe that any great innovations in the alts could simply be ported over to bitcoin and it would maintain its primacy, but this is proving to not be true.  I have no attachment to bitcoin, if it grows and thrives, great, if not, I'm diversified so its still great.

Can you share what happened so others don't make the same mistake? How much did you lose?  I am very sorry.

By this graph the price is approaching the horizontal asymptote ie...  stabilizing at this price.   Or am I reading this wrong?  College was a long time ago.

A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can make - its currently set to 8 decimals. a satoshi is 0.00000001 of bitcoin.  A fraction of a penny is US currency.

This is why "millibits" or "satoshi's" needs to become common terminology. A dollar for a millibit sounds affordable. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:00:01
They can start by making wallets that default to the millibit system (most wallets have it as an optional setting now that is defaulted to bitcoins.

$1000 or $2000 in gold and silver each, not much as its only a hedge against hyperinflation in my eyes (it would hypervaluate in this situation).  The rest I would split between bitcoin and ethereum.  Being diversified saves you the sadness of watching one struggle while the other skyrockets, and you are holding the wrong one.
@_date: 2016-09-14 12:07:57
You could also run the bitcoin through an exchange or shapeshift it to another coin and back again.
@_date: 2016-09-03 19:53:32
It's become a pump and dump coin? 
@_date: 2016-09-14 18:29:41
I'm thinking by then the ecosystem will be too diverse and complex for that to occur. Only possible when its young and barely out of beta testing.
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:01:55
Sends like a better fit for ethereum.

Interesting point here - if you talk to people who have trash service paid by taxes, they often can't imagine that its a service that could be supplied by the private sector - in spite of the fact that it seems most people do pay for trash service.  This is an exact analogy to people who can't imagine that roads and emergency services  could be private as well (can you say AAA?).  I propose "special economic zones" in the US where we can once again experiment with teeny-tiny-itty-bitty fucking government and tax free living.  Imagine social services provided by miners or stakers?  Time to think outside of the box.

 "...but we really haven’t seen the end products and services use Bitcoin as quickly as we would have liked. With the introduction of Ethereum, we have not seen this type of energy and excitement from the community in quite a while.”

Its made several attempts at growth but the 1 mb limit seems to stall it everytime, is there any reason  to suspect this will be any different, or is the implication that it will go down this time?  Good buying op coming?

I just read my reddit post in an article this morning "poor bitcoin, hate to see an old friend this way" surprised the hell out of me.

I'm a DAO head and I welcome the idea, no need to make a DAO for that, just submit a proposal to THE DAO.  Most would probably welcome it, we understand that a strong bitcoin is needed for a strong ether.  Only problem is that the DAO is only interested in funding projects we can profit from, not sure how that could be monetized.  The DAO gets a cut of transaction fees?  I don't see many bitcoiners being thrilled with that prospect.

I would say buying a small amount monthly (dollar cost averaging) would be ok to do in tandem with paying your current debt.  What ratio only you can decide.  Would suck to miss out on a possible 1000% return even on a small amount while paying back a 10% or 15% debt.  When I was in grad school this was the advice I was given by a financial planner when I asked if I should invest or pay off my loans first.  Of course a return of even 20% was unread of those days.  Also you might want to diversify and do a little of both bitcoin and ethereum, one hedging the other.  A great thing about crypto is you can invest even $5 a month if you like.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:45:20
Possibly. I'm afraid to use bitcoin now.  I sent two payments to linode and PIA through bitpay, both failed, I've not heard back from either bitpay or the companies involved. I will only use btc inside an exchange now - and change it to eth to send between exchanges or to coinbase/gemini .

How would a proliferation of businesses and corporations using the blockchain increase the price of bitcoin?  Assuming no great increase  in the use of BTC, how does increased use of the blockchain affect the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-30 05:08:52
Does increased use of the blockchain increase bitcoin price?  Other than making it sound more mainstream and safe to the average joe and increasing demand?  Is there any other mechanisms going on here?
@_date: 2016-05-19 09:23:34
Then what is this? It always goes up during periods of high transaction volumes.
