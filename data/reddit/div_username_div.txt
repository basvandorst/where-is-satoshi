exactly this, but not just in crypto.  the walmart effect means people want exactly what they want,  exactly right now,  for exactly the lowest price. and oh yeah,  they want you to reimburse them 100% for it when it inevitably breaks.

I am 100% ok with hiw they're hanxling this. What else do you expect them to do? Could be a lot worse.

or just chill out and accept that shit happens and that this scenario is panning out a lot better than we initially thought it would.  I'm happy to take 64% now and accept that i will probably get the rest back in due time. i'll chalk it uo to a cheap lesson on how i shouldn't keep anything on exchanges longer than absolutely possible. we can all get better from this.

U had a 'high-paying tech job'  and only have 15k of assets? 
@_date: 2016-09-08 11:07:37

Poloniex prices are based on USDT exchange rate, not on USD.
USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency whose value is "tethered" to the value of USD. Up until a month ago, the USD:USDT ratio had always been 1:1. Over the past month, the ratio has fluctuated such that USDT has been worth as little as like 0.95 USD and as much as 1.07 USD. This distorts the value of cryptoa that are traded against USDT on Poloniex.

Depending on when you bought, this might be a taxable event subject to short-term capital gains.

U can tell it's awesome because of the way it is. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 02:45:04

total number of nodes has reduced by 50% since 2012, i.e. BTC is becoming "less decentralized".
seems like a bad thing.
