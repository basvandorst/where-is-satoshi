Svenska Handelsbanken AB, Europe’s best-capitalized bank, says it will treat Bitcoin like any other product.
“The local Handelsbanken branch always makes a commercial evaluation of the companies that want to become customers,” said Henrik Westman, a spokesman for the lender. The bank is open to new operations provided they “follow the existing rules and regulation,” Westman said.

The charges will get moved over to your new card.
Have you ever had a card cancelled because of fraud, but had subscriptions or recurring payments set up on that card?  If it looks like this is just a recurring payment coming from Coinbase to your CC, it is likely that your CC company is just going to treat it as such and charge your new card.

I said "might" because in the situation that the assets are sold and returned proportionally to the depositors it might end up being larger as a percentage than if an unsecured creditor at a systemically important bank were to experience a bail-in type event. 
Yes, the FDIC has been in the red before, but it is likely that a set of cascading failures would prevent this from being an option again:

Unlikely this would happen in this sense.

One point that I think is often overlooked when discussing how bit coin/cryptocurrencies can change the world/society is how deflationary currencies will impact our attitudes and behaviors as consumers.  Our current method of consumption and thinking revolving around consumption is a buy now on credit and pay off later mentality.  Knowing that we can borrow money easily and cheaply, we opt for immediate gratification and don’t mind the value of our currency depreciating because of our assumption (conscious or not) that wages will increase in line with inflation and we will be able to pay off our debts easier in the future.  
Introducing a deflationary currency into the world should help to decrease “wasteful” consumption, and cause society as a whole to re-think and readjust their lifestyles to accommodate a currency that increases in value over time.  Think about peoples consumption mentality if they know that their btc will be worth more in the future.  People will put off consuming most un-necessary luxuries that are outside of their ability (if they are smart) knowing that their money will be worth more in the future.  This will most likely lead to a “consumption on demand” billing philosophy, where customers are billed at automatically calculated varying rates for their consumption of services.  Ie: electricity - the price will be calculated in real time and the consumer will be billed in real time via a series of micro transactions.  People will think twice about walking out of the bedroom and leaving the light on.  Same goes for TV viewing, even internet.  Bandwidth could be available on demand and prioritized by the fee the user is willing to pay.  Users and services that require a higher priority (more bandwidth) would pay more in real time for the assurance that bandwidth would be available to them.  This can be extrapolated over any number of industries, but the point is that consumers will be much more mindful of consuming within their means. 
Obviously a lot of other social implications can be drawn from this, but I just thought this is an interesting point that I have not heard anyone touch on yet.

@_date: 2014-09-18 14:11:14
That is a bit of a stretch, but I understand your frustration.  They built a business from the ground up and are constantly adding new features and fixing things.  If you have ever run a startup, it seems like their growing pains have been minimal compared to what they potentially could be.  The paper wallet feature is "broken", but at least everyone's coins are able to be retrieved with minimal effort.  If their multi sig or paper wallet feature was completely broken and everyone's coins were lost, that would be a totally different story.

China is trying to isolate their banking system from everything else.  They (along with the rest of the world) are on the brink of outright collapse.  There are rumors of China's interest in creating a gold backed currency, which they would like to replace or be used in parallel with the USD as a reserve currency.  Right now, everyone in China is rushing to get their money out of physical assets and into cash (CNY).  Once they realize that cash isn't safe, or isn't available, they will be seeking other hard assets for wealth preservation (gold, btc, etc).  The Chinese government wants to prevent everyone from rushing into BTC before they can put their own currency in place.  
Remember, deflation happens before hyperinflation.  We are just entering the deflationary stage right now (China housing prices, people rushing to sell any assets below NAV so that they can exit their position with something as opposed to nothing).

Here is a transcript from anyone who can't see the video:
You may have heard the phrase "bitcoin," but understanding what it is and how it works can be a bit complicated. NY1's Tara Lynn Wagner has spent some time looking into the world of cryptocurrency and has put together a series of reports called "Show Me the Money." She filed the following report, Part 1 of the series.
Never heard of bitcoin? You're hardly alone.
"What is that?" says one person.
"I don't know what they are," says another.
"I'm not interested at my age to even bother with bitcoin," says a third.
Plenty of people, however, interested. Millions, in fact doing, tens of millions of dollars worth of transactions every day.
So what exactly is bitcoin?
"Bitcoin is a virtual currency," says Alan Mekler, chairman and CEO of MediaBistro. "You don't actually physically have it. It's essentially on your computer or on a memory stick."
There are a few ways to look at it. For one thing, it's a decentralized payment system, meaning it's traded without going through a bank or middle man. It's also completely borderless, not backed by any government.
To get started, you just need to set up an online wallet and buy a bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin to put in it. This can be done through an exchange or directly from other users. Those bitcoins can then be used to pay for purchases or to transfer money from peer to peer.
"Bitcoin can and will be used to buy a cup of coffee, or it can and will be used to send hundreds of millions of dollars of value to anybody in the world, any business in the world, instantly and for free," says Austin E. Alexander, deputy director of Bitcoin Center in New York City.
Each transaction is verified in a public log to make sure all of the bitcoins in existence are accounted for, and there will only ever be a finite amount, 21 million, only about half of which are currently in circulation. They're released in blocks to miners who use special equipment to solve complex math problems.
The other side of the coin are the people who see them as an investment, and like any other commodity, their value depends on the day. When bitcoin first came into existence in 2009, they were given the arbitrary value of 11 cents. Last December, they were trading for about $1,000 bucks apiece. Currently, the price is hovering around $430.
"Value is determined by a marketplace and by people, and so the bitcoin people will tell you that the value of bitcoin is inherent in as many people as basically use bitcoins," says Joe Deaux, economics analyst at The Street.
In our next segment, we'll look at some of the regulatory and legal issues springing up in response to this self-regulated industry.

Or are you missing the point.  It is pretty clear that most banks are not bitcoin friendly, and even if they were it would be a bureaucratic nightmare to have btc payroll initiated.  Besides that, a large percentage of people's paychecks are processed by companies like ADP.  
What makes more sense?  To try to convince a large bank to use btc (unlikely), to try to convince ADP to use btc (more likely, but still unlikely at this stage), convince a local bank or credit union to have btc payroll (potentially, but most credit unions lack geographic diversity) OR have a company like Bitwage provide this service for now.  Once they are noticed they will be scooped up by one of the larger players, have work outsourced to them, etc etc...

I am not attending the conference, but have considered it both this year and in the past.  While I understand your desire to appease both sides, I feel that a harder stance must be taken in order to preserve the integrity of our community.  A clear search of bitcoinist.net + GAW will show that they are a completely bias news source.  How much would we have to raise via crowdfunding in order to buy out GAW's sponsorship?  As a community, I am sure that we would be willing to pay a 10% premium to what GAW paid, as long as Josh's speaking time can be replaced by someone (community picked) who will give a presentation on identifying and avoiding bitcoin scams.

The fix will come. Bottom line is that its a better choice to have to pay a small miners fee and/or wait a small amount of time (shorter than the traditional banking system) in order to send value, over not being able to send it at all via a regular bank.

Matt - you need to explain that the block rewards are only part of the mining equation.  The miners also earn transaction fees, which over time are supposed to offset the decreasing block reward. 
The high block reward was an initial incentive for people to donate their computing power towards mining.  
@_date: 2013-09-14 14:47:26
I have no relation to the founder of Dealco.in but have been following the project and believe that it is one of the only (invest able) BTC startups that "gets BTC into the hands of the consumer" in a space that isn't overly crowded.  The every day consumer has no idea how to use mining hardware (nor do they care about it), but they can easily use a person to person exchange site to buy BTC.

This author needs a link to this: 
action taken
designed to protect the financial system from the
risk posed by Liberty Reserve
an online, virtual currency, money transfer system that was
conceived and operated specifically to allow
and encourage
illicit use because of the
anonymity it offers.
Let me go back to the guidance I discussed earlier. FinCEN has been out front in issuing
our guidance to make it clear that we see virtual currency
administrators and exchangers
as a
type of money services business.
These businesses are as much a
part o
f the financial framework
as any other type of financial institution
. As such, they have
the same obligations as
financial institutions,
the same obligations as
any other
money services business out there.
But keep in mind: this action was t
aken against one financial institution and one type of
financial service.
That’s what a criminal case is, and that’s what a regulatory action is
action against a particular violator. With this action we were not painting with a broad brush
against a
n entire industry. I do not think that is fair to any industry in any situation, let alone this

Matt - An important point to make is that a large part of the price slide the last few days was most likely due to people realizing end of year gains by making purchases through BitPay/Coinbase.  It appears as if the payment processors dump the coins on the market in real time when a purchase is made in order to lock in the USD value to send to the vendor.

Earlier this month it had dropped - I bought around 2.3 and it was around 1.7 a day or two ago I believe.  Not a huge drop, but significant. I am not concerned, I am using it as a chance to add to my position and bring down my average purchase price.

In regards to what is being spoken about right now at the hearing.  The best approach to taxing Bitcoin would be to tax at the point of sale.  The transaction can be broken up at the point of sale, with a percentage of the transaction going to the merchant and a portion to the government.  This would allow for income taxes and the mess associated with them to be eliminated.  Those who hold BTC won't hesitate to pay for their item in BTC knowing that they won't have to pay income/capital gains tax, and it is likely that their holdings have appreciated since purchased.  Different tax rates could be implemented geographically, and the system could be implemented at the payment processor level (Coinbase/Bitpay).

One decentralized markets pop up, you will be able to value any asset vs any asset and trade between them.  All of the information you mentioned can be included in the blockchain. 
One quick example, there are MANY: 
Clean title can be assured by the nature of the bitcoin protocol (tracing each transaction back). 
Any asset can be priced in any asset.  Ex: buy a house for oil futures and apple shares, sell your apartment for bitcoin 
This eliminates the need for copyrights in their current sense because all of this information can be entered into the blockchain and it will be indisputable.

Using Bitcoin can eliminate income taxes and a complex tax system.
The best approach to taxing Bitcoin would be to tax at the point of sale. The transaction can be broken up at the point of sale, with a percentage of the transaction going to the merchant and a portion to the government. This would allow for income taxes and the mess associated with them to be eliminated.

Different tax rates could be implemented geographically, and the system could be implemented at the payment processor level (Coinbase/Bitpay). 
Because most POS systems are iPads (or comparable), GPS can be used to tax geographically.  Governments will receive their tax revenue in real time and eliminate most inefficiencies and paperwork. 
It also could eliminate paperwork associated with large sales (car, property, etc).  Transfer of ownership can be encrypted in the blockchain.
