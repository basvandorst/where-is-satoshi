Ok, ill look into it. It has some good info though... and yes I can work on the aesthetics. Thank you!

Well, I could replace it. Do you have a website that has more clear/easy information for the beginning user? I tried finding one thats bitcoin core centered but I couldn’t find one.

Yeah its pretty obvious they are bank like and centralized. Theres almost no other place to buy btc using fiat for a good price. I, like most users, buy btc from coin base and move it to a hardware wallet. Problem solved...

Yeah ok guy, thanks for being so useful to my good cause. You might be a pro but im actually helping spread adoption to the little people.

Yes im aware of the war thats dividing the community. Im indifferent but you’re right, for the average user, it would be best not to confuse them with the whole btc/bch war. Ill change it to bitcoin.org

Thats a pretty good one, ill probably replace it.

Whats wrong with coinbase? There isnt much else to buy btc using fiat in america... I used coinmama but thats not new user friendly. I changed it to bitcoin.org .... any more constructive criticism?... inequality but the y doesent show up on mobile

I will consider it if i find a better source of info for people starting.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:58:06
Thank you! For some reason it looks different on my phone, but on the computer it has the y.
