Thanks, great idea to outsource proofreading to the masses by the way!

I think this post goes against the community guidelines...

Interesting read!

Mathematically, we require that the miner’s profit (cf. Eq. 5) remain constant for any quantity of block space, Q:
I believe remain should be remains in this sentence. Cheers 1HKt7VSDRZXRm7V3Lo4FP6W1Bc2QBK43iE

This is actually something I've wanted to see for a long time!
You might want to make the whole webpage wrap a bit better for smaller-sized screens. I was a bit confused until I realized I had to scroll quite a bit sideways to see the block delay on my 1366x768 laptop. Thank you for the site!
Edit: Looks great!

Relevant site: 
Seems like the spam txs sit in the 1-10 satoshis per byte range, so a fee of 0.0002 is fine to avoid delays for the average tx size of 694 bytes.

As I have understood it, the time it takes for a block to propagate through the network is on the order of a few seconds. In that case, isn't the network "sleeping" while the miners are trying to find a block on average every 10 minutes?
For example, doubling the rate of block discovery to every 5 minutes while at the same time halving the individual block rewards would have the same effect as doubling the block size on the bitcoin protocol throughput without the drawbacks of miners having to propagate large blocks. Increasing the block discovery rate would also mean that the miner rewards are more spread out, thus decreasing the incentive to join mining pools. It also means that users of the network get transactions confirmed more quickly.
Can someone explain why this is not a valid solution to the block size issue? It seems that the network could have an order of magnitude or so higher throughput without increasing centralization.
