I agree:


This makes no sense. I don't think anyone who knows how to do research would ever say this.
Also, 


This sounds like a bunch of big words thrown together. I don't think it is a list of topics to research.


2021? That seems awfully far away...

I wish I was on drugs.
I think NY is propped up on a 200 year history of good luck and positive momentum. But it could reverse and become a hollowed out shell. All the arrogance and selfishness could reap its' rewards.

Pretty much everything he has been saying about Gold is more applicable to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-05 21:26:17
This is really important. There is a good reason that most mainstream articles have pictures of Casascius coins or even dollars.
It is because people can't think of money without a physical form. The idea of money as information is too hard for them to understand at this time.
Give them 5 years and then they will get it.
This is why anyone who knows about and understands Bitcoin is so far ahead of everyone else.

So true. People feel empowered because they can vote, but they just elect a new politician that makes promises that they want to hear. Then they get poorer because of inflation, but don't even know it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:59:42
Because there were no bitcoins on it?
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:17:13
Coinbase continues to move ahead of Bitpay, at least in terms of positioning and partnerships.

Isn't it called a fire safe, so protect the contents against fire?
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:12:34
Maybe Ecuador came to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:21:33
Sorry for your loss.
One thing I don't understand is why people have a safe in their house. It's just one more thing for people to steal. And, if they don't steal it they will beat the combination out of the owner. 
Can anyone explain what is the rationale?
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:53:22
I agree. Definitely feel like this is the knee of the curve.
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:37:56
I hope it goes down to $10.
And then to $100,000.

It doesn't seem very reliable to me.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:39:09
I have been following Bitcoin for years, but I am still amazed so often...
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:49:57
No way. There was a "double top" at 600. If you sold and it never came back to 600, they you would be screwed.
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:12:05
But if it does succeed each bitcoin should be worth $50k - $5M.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:47:33
That's nice for you, but it sucks for the environment. How much pollution is generated to cool a whole city?

FWIW, my mom has a 10 year old Dell computer and it still works fine. Amazing. I keep waiting for it to die but it won't.
Unfortunately she won't upgrade Win XP...

You're OK if:
1. You use 2FA
2. You don't have a large amount of bitcoins.
If you have a large amount, then invest in getting someone to help you.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:49:26
I think some smart city that wants businesses to move there instead of driving them away (like California) will use Bitcoin regulation to attract Bitcoin businesses.

I wonder if he accepts Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:12:53
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:57:16
Sorry, I meant the total amount.
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:40:22
Yes, some percentage of that $58M is not transactions.
But it's close enough for estimating.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:12:31
Awesome! Can't wait to go too!

There is a depression once every 80 years on average. It's possible that the next one will be much deeper than the Great Depression.

I think it should all be one input box. "Enter TxID, To Address or From Address".

What is hodl?
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:51:35
This argument is silly. How do you know that there is not some force that will have the opposite effect?
1. How do you know that the company exchanges it for dollars?
2. The company decides that instead of holding cash it holds Bitcoin. As of 2012, Dell had $12 BILLION in cash.
3. The people who use it to buy products simply buy back the same amount of Bitcoin.
4. The people who use it to buy products think Bitcoin is useful. They buy MORE Bitcoin than they spend on the products. They convert some of their savings and investments to Bitcoin.
5. The employees of the company start using Bitcoin.
6. The media uses the story to create massive awareness of Bitcoin for 500 million people. Some of those people start buying Bitcoin.

I think I know this game. It's called "Asteroids".
Seriously though, looks awesome!
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:44:07
I think Austin (or another up-and-coming city) should become "Bitcoin city". 
Give huge tax breaks to any company that is associated with or accepts Bitcoin. It could become the richest city in the world.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:35:16
$200 would look cheaper.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:27:10
Andreas, can you please share the address?
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:10:47
I guess it makes sense in a way if it is cheaper than rent...

What about unbearable fucking heat in the summer in NY?
@_date: 2014-07-15 20:55:42
I hope so.

When was the last one?
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:45:48
They couldn't care less. They think that no city can compete with NY. That's why they set up the laws that way.
Who knows. If the financial system changes (like say...Bitcoin), NY could crumble like Detroit.

Maybe CA can become the Bitcoin Financial Center of the world.

Mom and Dad are likely not rich.
Either ignore them or do the opposite.

Wow, just wow.
Bitcoin daily transaction volume is $58M. Combined transaction volume for Visa, MasterCard, American Express and China Pay is $36B.
$58M/$36B is 0.16%. If Bitcoin becomes 16%, it would need to grow 100x. Crazy.
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:57:59
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:13:52
Dell is the  largest private US company by revenue. Crazy.
@_date: 2014-07-31 11:39:17
Awesome. This shows that although there is a lot of talk about Bitcoin, we have not yet reached the start of the adoption S-curve.
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:52:22
This already happened for people who were mining and buying a few years ago for less than 1 cent.
$500 -&gt; $500,000 is a 1,000x increase.
$0.01 -&gt; $400 is a 40,000x increase.
Also, the next black swan event could touch off a global depression, much deeper than the Great Depression. If banks and countries fail, it could be the catalyst for $500,000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:28:14
This seals Bitcoin's success. 
With politicians on board, who is going to try to stop it?
