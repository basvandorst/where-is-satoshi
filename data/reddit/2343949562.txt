Venezuela seems like the obvious answer

How have they been verified as safe? Any reccomendations for a good place to learn about this?

Problem is billions of dollars in gift cards go unredeemed every year.

You can convert anything to md5. If you mean decrypt sha256 then encrypt with md5 then no. I don't know why I bothered answering this to be honest.

If I had to guess it would be because a private key has not yet been used to sign a transaction if the address has never sent a transaction, so the quantum attack would be missing an important piece of information.

From what I understand, if an address has been used to send a transaction it is theoretically at risk of a quantum attack. Addresses that have only received Bitcoin and never sent are not at risk.

Giving an upvote, not because I agree but because I believe there could be a good discussion around this.
Ask yourself: If Bitcoin Cash's tweak was such an improvement to the network, why is it not worth more than Bitcoin? And why was the tweak not able to gain consensus on a decentralized network?

I wouldn't promote hoarding money either. But I do think that Bitcoin can prove to be a good investment because of the fact that it is deflationary. According to basic economic theory of supply and demand, holding Bitcoin should result in a higher price. We must remember that the more money one has the more likely they are to spend it. So the money will eventually work it's way back into the system, but until it does it can be securely held by an individual while it grows in value.

Interesting thought. Based on my values, it is a good thing though. If people were to stop investing in wasteful businesses that are destroying the environment with excess the world may just be a better place. Promoting spending (in my opinion) is not beneficial to the conservation of this planet we all share
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:56:48
Can you explain how something being deflationary makes it a bad investment?

If only there wasn't a pay wall

I'm just concerned with how high transaction fees are getting. It almost makes buying small things with Bitcoin not an option.
