The funny thing is that China will support this. Then they get to have it both ways, just as they do with the economy and governmental systems. One system for HK and another for mainland China. Laughing all the way to the bank and the next Communist Party convention.

If you read the article, it's not his friend, it's his friend's buddy, Louis Basenese of Wall Street Daily. This dude is anti-bitcoin, big time, and has written a lot of filth blasting it over the last year or so. He already published this "fatal flaw" article a day or two ago and nobody noticed. Why? Because it's about the 51% attack, which is old news.

That Amazon posting was a really thin hoax. If this one's a hoax, he's gone to a lot more trouble, continuing to be involved in the discussion and taking some hits. This may be a hoax, but I'm guessing it's the real deal.

Disastercoin is a  nightmare of insanity. If you're looking for something that allows colored coins and will actually succeed, try NXT.

Why do we have laws at all? To create some stability and predictability. Without regulation and enforcement, it would be the Wild West, which is a difficult environment in which to grow an economy or make a livelihood. Ultimately, some order steps in to fill the void, generally militia or organized crime. I'd rather have the government, as bad as it sometimes seems.

We dropped on overstock because of the bad China news that week; Overstock probably helped stave off a serious drop. TigerDirect is owned by Systemax, I believe. $400+ market cap.

The dollar signs can help them overcome indecisiveness. When it's clear there's money to be made, those crooks will be tripping over each other to cut into line. So if there are no big hurdles for this ETF filing, then it could start trading later in 2014. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:19:53
I'm not quite sure, either, except that eToro is in the UK and I think CFDs are more widely used outside of the US than here. The US needs to decide whether BTC is a currency, a stock, a commodity, or what. If it is a commodity, then I believe it would be regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. And commodity ETFs do not need to hold all their deposits in commodities, only around 7% I think. But currency and stock ETFs seem to have larger holdings. The Winks seem to be pushing the currency angle.

That is not what the article says.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:09:20
Yes, and I see some other major factors, too. We are just sorting out the regulatory landscape. Once we get more clarity from governments, and it becomes clear that BTC does not depend on Chinese yuan deposits (uncertainty which will drag down prices this week), then your Steps 2, 3, and 4 could gain serious momentum.

It is huge news. Thanks for passing this along.

Welcome aboard, folks, and I'll consider using cheapflowers (though I do hope they have a different label on the bouquets when delivered). So, just to summarize, we have Overstock reporting $124K in orders in its first day of accepting bitcoin, and on this same day we get news that a major porn payment processor and a network of florists are accepting bitcoin. Not a bad day...a growing market cap improves the value of our BTC. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:06:34
This is a good article. There's nothing new for most of us, but this type of explanation in a forum like the NYT can only help spread the word of BTC's legitimacy and value.

I'm glad you contacted him using Gmail. You might not have gotten a response using Yahoo or Outlook.

Amen. And doesn't Paypal still have to pay off Visa, etc.? They could cut that out and quickly become the default BTC payment gateway. Also, their parent company (eBay) is slowly becoming a virtual currency exchange itself if you look at many of the BTC and alternative currency auctions. I would think that at some point, they might see dollar signs from that potential. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:37:17
Thanks, but the fact those are publicly traded doesn't make them any safer. Based on their public profiles, I think I'll pass. For some truly cutting edge BTC companies you can invest in directly, I suggest browsing the choices at

That is hilarious! I never knew illegal drug sales, etc. were supposed to be reported. Nevertheless, thank you for providing us with the first official words of wisdom on BTC from the horse's mouth. Nice to know that gains are classified, for now, as ordinary income.

I've sent money to Kiva before. They have some great programs. I think it would be great for anyone who has profited nicely from Bitcoin (especially the earliest/richest among them) to be generous with their donations. For some of us, it's nickels and dimes compared to what larger donations might achieve (though the nickels and dimes do add up). 
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:15:59
Actually, whether this is true or not (I'm guessing it is true), I think this is the perfect way to leak the news. If this guy's account of his communications with them is true, they led him right to this info and allowed him to post it. This way, Google execs can seem to be grassroots and down-to-earth. So when they announce for sure that they're doing this, they won't get hit with as many criticisms of "they're manipulating the price. I bet they bought in just before the announcement." If I were Google, I could not write a better script than this. The true believers are going to cash in; others will have missed this boat.

No skin off your back to join, just an e-mail address to get the $100 in your wallet. Is it legit? If and when their exchange comes up, we will see. I don't plan to transfer money in before then. If they have some VC to burn, then I can think of worse ways to advertise than handing out free virtual money. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:54:09
So now we've got Singapore, France, China, the US, and probably others I don't know about basically saying that bitcoin is legal, possibly useful, and not a currency. I think we're well on our way to regulatory certainty.
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:28:30
If approved, it could reduce volatility, provide another way to invest in bitcoin, and further add to the coin's legitimacy among the Wall Street crowd. I believe they also would need to buy some more coin (maybe the Feds' Silk Road stash?) so as to hold a certain percentage of the underlying asset.
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:00:16
They probably were talking about the auctions for cryptocurrency. That was news a couple of days ago. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 08:11:25
This is huge. The Bank of China basically just legitimized bitcoin, while saying it is not a currency and carries risks (which are obvious points). I've read three different translations now and there is quite a bit of positive language in here for bitcoin. The word "monitoring", if that is an accurate translation, is fairly passive and non-interventionist. Folks, I think they're going to let it roll, assuming the government's public and private stances match up.
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:34:47
I wouldn't sell, but I sure am hoping to buy more. There should be some real downward pressure from the Chinese regulations/New Year and the press stories about the Feds' Silk Road BTC sale. Bitcoin prices are probably going to be as low as we'll see for awhile. It could be the last great buying opportunity.

I am a college prof and I believe the current education system is broken, but any disruptive private alternative will need to have some sort of quality assurance. We use accreditation. I think it is possible that a group of companies could get together and create a third party entity (like the dolphin safe tuna or sustainable lumber groups) that could verify quality, but it would take time for that to become accepted and trusted by employers, etc. More likely, we need to work within the current system to adapt it.

I think the 100% secret is selling put options on stocks. He's been pushing this one for a few years now and he gives it away if you read the language carefully. Smart guy and I agree with many of his ideas, but kind of a buffoon with a healthy dose of snake oil. If you can separate the good from the ridiculous and still find the newsletter subscription is worthwhile, then it probably is.

Wow, they really are looking at jumping in, aren't they?

I hope it succeeds. If it runs into problems, then the best alternative I have seen is NXT. That is truly a better coin, built from the ground up. But I disagree with people who say that there's only room for one currency. When you pay for something, you see both Visa and MC buttons, right? I can foresee BTC and NXT buttons on every payment site. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:37:55
I agree. Use this post or create another. We will help keep it up there.

It's kind of boring to watch after all the volatile excitement. But if bitcoin is going to grow and truly be accepted more widely, then a more stable price is a good thing.

I read that as saying they want to understand it better and make sure they are complying with money laundering laws, probably when depositors are transferring money to buy bitcoin. The people they invited to that meeting include government officials and economics professors, neither of whom are going to be bullish on bitcoin (or really know much about it). But it's a good first step. Once they do understand it better, who knows?
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:58:36
You know, this is exactly what those top 1%, the early BTC holders, should be doing. With the rest of us, yes we can give away nickels and dimes, but to really get this coin more universally accepted, those top hoarders should be spreading the wealth and encouraging young people to get on board. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:35:42
The anonymity is a selling point for some. I think flat-lining for awhile is a real possibility, though the rising tide of merchant acceptance may generate enough exposure to bring some new people in. At that point, if merchants see a real benefit (saving 2-5% on cc fees and chargebacks), then it should be in their best interest to tout the benefits, offer special sales, etc. Also, we also could be underestimating the impact of the futures/derivatives markets. Once those greedy Wall Streeters get their hands on this, a lot of BTC may get bought up by ETFs, etc.

I'm a fan also. Very cool. But because he is publicizing his quest so much, I think people are more likely to cut him a good deal (as with giving him the wallets for a low price). Would be less artificial, and a lot more difficult, if he did the whole thing on his own and then wrote the story. Kind of like the guy who turned a paper clip into a car on craigslist.
