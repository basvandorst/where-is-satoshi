GDAX suspended my account (and money) since 4 December. Support is not writing back since 11 December. I don't know what's going on, but please be very careful with Coinbase and GDAX.

So you think it's ok to suspend my account and money without any explanation?
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:43:40
This is what I'm asking them since 4 December. An explanation would be very nice.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:39:36
Would be helpful if they explain to me what I did!!!!

I'm telling my story to the community: GDAX suspended my account and my money with no explanation, and they are not writing back my emails since 11 December. I have no idea why they suspended my account but I deserve an explanation and most of all I deserve to have my money back!
