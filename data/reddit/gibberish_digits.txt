Almost Human mentions bitcoin almost every episode, which is very cool of them! I think we should upvote every instance of this happening for visibility and watch the show. We are not as much of a bunch as TV needs to continue producing it, but at least we can show our gratitude for constant shout outs. The show is crazy good by itself.

you can just write you privkey down on a piece of paper by hand.
you can make privkeys from bootable usb-stick (there was a guy here), switch off you computer and get out all the bios accumulators for like a day (not sure if this will help)
you can make as many paper wallet copies as you like and keep them separately in different stable places. if it will fire in all the places, loosing bitcoin is the least of your problems.

I don't know what country do you live in, but here, were i am, we know plenty of stories about totalitarian regimes.
Yes, idea is there and i don't say crypto will be stomped upon imminently. I'm just saying, that there is no such thing as "government realizes". They have a very different mindset. People are cattle for them. There is no "realization" for them. They will wage war relentlessly and using any means possible. Because that's how they got on top and that's how they do everything. They don't really understand "idea" language. The only thing they can understand is power. And there will be arrests, there will be jailed people again and again, until everybody gets a clear message. And i'm not sure how bitcoin community will answer. 
There was an anonimus hacker group. There was plenty of arrests. And I don't see any of there acts lately.
Of course, protection of your own monetary system can be a very good incentive for smart people to work on bitcoin in the darkness of illegality. So, I hope, that if the price of the currency and the value of their own money will depend on their ability to protect users from government's eyes, it will be enough incentive to fight this intellectual war.

This is the only thing, where i do not 100% agree with Andreas. Some systems in nature are hierarchical: any competition for females results in hierarchy. Every competition for resources too. I agree that we are trying to apply hierarchical approach for massive scale and this is not right. But to conclude, that nature lacks hierarchy seems wrong, because at the end of the day we are the product of nature too.

Foundation guys are actually very useful. They speak Bureaucratian, they talk good things about bitcoin on tv, they parry the attacks on it, they help drive the adoption up. 
Also, they are doing it voluntery on their own risk. For that risk they receive donations, when community appreciates their work. It's their job of choice. I don't see what's wrong with that. 
Don't feel guilty, if anyone of them goes to jail after false allegations. Non of us forces them to do what they do, and our appreciation of their work comes in form of btc donations.

ML laws are a sweet concept to remove incentive for bandits to make money on illicit activities.
But in fact - mafia and cartels did not disappear. There is a lot of drug-trading going on. This means that this law is not working. 
So, it seems, that ML laws are just a way for banks and govts to centralize drugdealing industry and direct the profits from it to flow to bankers and govts.
It's like a dam: at first you just block the flow by law. Then you open a couple of valves to let it leak in desired direction. So, it's illegal to launder money only if you don't launder it through certain banks.
It's a centralization of power. Nothing else.

Russian Gov don't give a rats ass if you steal from Hollywood or American\European game publishers. Pirates taxes on buying media are little and they actually "pay" Govts in form of attacking foreign economy.
But when you switch to another currency, that is not controlled by govts and central banks - you are "stealing" directly from central banks and Govts and you are "stealing" all of it. It's not really "stealing", but they surely think it is. 
Don't expect this to slide as easy as piracy in Russia (or any country for that matter). Media companies don't have their means of enforcement. Govts (Banks) do.
Everybody, who live in a country, where bitcoin is banned, should expect relentless enforcement of this. This is why bitcoin should think about plan "B", so it would be as anonymous as possible from the get go.

This is how mining looks:
If you are a bit short on money, you probably should consider other ways of getting bitcoin:
It would be easier to get bitcoin by selling some stuff you don't need for it, or to earn it by working for it. 
There are multiple marketplaces on the net. For example, you can try sell your stuff here:
You don't need to be IT-specialist to earn bitcoin (although it's preferable), there are people who mow lawns for bitcoin. I'm sure there are plenty of jobs to find.
You can also build you reputation on  and get loans.

This courier insures the cost of the package in the moment he receives it automatically. Previous courier just wount him let have the package, before the insurance. It does not matter, if he steals it or not. If he steals it, he pays for it to the recipient automatically (time limit for delivery). So, he does not have an incentive to do it. It's a bit harsh, but fair. Bitcoin is not returnable (no charge-backs). So this thing is also does not have any "contracts". Value moves according to rules and incentive.
But, according to what address automatically sent the insurance to the recipient, you can know on what part  of the way the package was stolen.
There is not much incentive for the courier not to deliver the package.

7. freedom

I doubt that Russia will starve without bitcoin. Russia starved not once in it's history. And it's still here. Not much import happens in food department.
Russia is a raw material exporter with huge territory. Demographic numbers suggest massive stagnation in population, which is nor very high in itself. It's a very rich country, where bandits hijacked all natural resources. But even they can not really "digest" all of the profits from export (they already have all the boats, planes and overprices paintings in the world), so the crumbs from government's table are enough for people not to riot. Scary repressions help with this too, of course.
What Russia will loose is brains, that can do innovation. Russia was loosing brainy people for a long time. Seems like Russian Govt's are okay with that. All tech announcements in Russia are jokes. Nobody buys "Russian tech" or "Russian brands" because everybody knows they are overprices useless rubbish.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:52:51
I laughed my ass off on this.
Okay... here is my little conspiracy theory just to entertain myself (read as a fiction):
Russia Today is funded from Russian government budget (and the amount of money going there is increasing every year). RT is, obviously, an information war asset of Russia. RT hypes Bitcoin like crazy, so maybe they hope to disrupt American and European powers that be, shifting their attention to bitcoin.
Everybody knows that China and Russia are a bit stiff on freedoms and they banned Bitcoin right away. Because well... they don't loose any rep for doing it. Most of their citizens will just accept this ban and move on to their lives.
But America and Europe on the other hand are the "lands of the free": you can't just ban bitcoin there for no reason. It would be not very "American" and this politics, based on "freedom protection" will collapse like a house of cards.
Closing one of the biggest exchanges would be not very good for this scheme of things for Russia.
I think that the majority of volume on BTC-e in fiat is generated by citizens of wealthy countries (that is not Russia).
Volgograd prosecutors have a harsh time because of terrorist activities in the city. So they wanted to make a scene, like they are doing something about it and tried to go after BTC-e to show their patrons, that they are doing something about terror. And then they got the memo from the top not to even think about it and close this investigation asap, because they are trying to jump over their heads.
So they now released this.

It basically means that if you issue or use something that serves as money on Russian Federation territory - you are breaking the law. Actually, we have some of those, but all of them are puny (like a bunch of little villages), centralized, can be quickly smashed and usually don't really pose any threat to RUR. Or it's a unit of a payment network, that is issued only when RUR are deposited.

I think, it's up to regulators to come up with regulations. It's not a problem of bitcoin community. Community will react on whatever regulations will be imposed. There are two ways really:
1. If there will be a ban, community will work on full-blown anonymity and go back to shadows. For government that will mean really expensive intellectual war with the smartest people from all over the world. Hardware and software solutions will emerge. It will be a passion project for every techie person out there. Bad side for bitcoin - very slow growth and adoption. But all the brainy guys will prefer crypto for their services. So govts will just loose all the great minds that can create tonns of new tech, businesses, jobs, revenue, taxes. Eventually they will allow it, just like marijuana, because they will not be able to enforce the ban. Not everybody smokes pot, but everybody uses money.  
2. If there will be no ban and soft enough regulation, it would be just easier and cheaper to comply, lots of investments will flow and the unicorns will sh*t rainbow all over the Earth (except Russia, i presume).
People have the power already. They vote by participating or not participating. You can not make them install some govt-edited software. There is no real leavers in govt's hands here. Except throwing the world into 19th century by switching off power grid (riot and civil war ensues).
The value of bitcoin is in minds, that are excited about the technology. You can not tell smart people what to be excited about and where to put your mind energy and effort.
Either regulators will understand that and well... comply with regulation, that math and science imposes on the universe, or everybody gonna have a bad time.
Drug war is exactly the same thing: you can not regulate nature. People biochemistry reacts on these substances and will always react. And there will always be people using this for profit no matter the cost. 
Drugs are bad for health. Bitcoin is not. Drugs are not very smart. Bitcoin community is. So good luck with this new war, if they want it.
tl;dr: we shouldn't care too much. It's coming anyway. Stalling it by ban will not do any good neither to gov't, nor to btc. But at the end - veritas in numeris.

Bitcoin community is not big, but it's twitchy about scams. 
If you say you accept bitcoin and you actually don't - bitcoin users may take it personally. And rightfully so: they give away tonnes of their own money, time and effort to promote bitcoin. If you get a free PR-ride with "accepting bitcoin" - remember, that your customer likely payed for that.

Massive riots are a looong way ahead (if any). There is nothing "massive" about bitcoin, except the idea and the technology potential.
I don't think bitcoin is a "riot" type of revolution. Imo, bitcoin's strength is in it's non-corporeal illusive nature. Developers in btc-community should think about ways to be able to use bitcoin even in countries, where it's banned. I don't endorse using it there. However, from an economic perspective, bitcoin economy can benefit from anyone, who can participate in it. And it's surviveability depends on an ability to withstand any ban enforcement. It's a simple law of nature: they will fight you and they will only respect you if you win.

In Russia, if you have "bitcoin" and "surrogate" in one article issued by Central Bank, means that it does not matter, what the law actually says. Because our laws have lots of blurry things. They will tie one to another in court any way they want. And no lawer will be able to help you. Even if there is no such thing - they will improvise.
The message is clear: if you will push it to masses - you will go to jail. RUR is crazy nowdays. And they have been preparing this RUR weakening for Olympics, i think. Because they expect lots of people with USD and EUR to visit. So, i guess, the message is: you can make small profit in btc - we woun't look. But if it blows out of proportion and frightened by "emerging bank crisis" people will start buying btc instead of USD\EUR (as planned) - bitcoiners will have a really bad time.

I live in Russia. We had a bar net (40 bars across the country). They accepted bitcoin. You could have a plate of food and a beer for bitcoin there. Guess where their acceptance went after Central Bank released the memo about bitcoin.))
So yeah. Merchants can stop accepting it in seconds, if the regulators ban it.
So now it's still possible to trade bitcoin on BTC-E, but there is no future for retailers and merchants here. And this is what i was really interested about. I don't use bitcoin as an investment mechanism for pump and dump. I want to work for bitcoin and to be able to buy things for it.

There will be the second closed meeting on this, but it's almost inevitable. It's already banned by "no surrogate" law. They are really just thinking how they will enforce it. Because their blabbering is not doing anything (btc-e price and volume stays the same). So, they will start with arrests and prosecutions. And they will do it as publicly as possible, i think.

The article is accurate. Most popular news resources posted this.
Bitcoin is now "money surrogate" (not by definition, but because Central Bank says so). And this article states, that they are starting to enforce this. btc-e volume and price did not react on previous memo (Russian people usually break the law until lots of arrests happen), so there will be arrests soon, i suppose.
I guess, Russia will be the first to really ban for citizens and enforce the ban.

It's not Russia's bank, it's just it's CEO. Although he was a minister of finance back in the day and he is from Putin's team. 
I think he knew, that Sberbank will issue this memo about bitcoin, and just wanted to protect SberBank's payment system, that it purchased not long ago (Yandex.Money). Because Yandex.Money can be mistaken for surrogate. 
It also may be that he genuinely all for the crypto. He is notorious for his somewhat ambiguous statements) He is actually very well educated, quite smart and enthusiastic. So, i wouldn't be surprised.

Prosecution probability estimation in countries, where bitcoin will be banned. 
I love bitcoin, but i'm sorry to say, i believe it will be banned in lots of countries. Torrent piracy is outlawed, and there is prosecution for piracy, but people still download torrents massively. Govts are not music\blu-ray industry. They will ruthlessly fight for monetary monopoly. 
So, if bitcoin will go in "dark-mode", it's better to know, what risk will people face doing bitcoin.

You get a computer that has freshly formatted hard drives, never was connected to any net, and has a freshly OS installed. You generate a bunch of privite keys on this computer, print it out on a paper and then you burn this computer in freakin lava.
Then you have private keys on paper, that (allegedly) never were anywere, that was physically connected to the internet, where hackers lurk.
That got me thinking... can we have a bootable usb-stick, that just generates private keys? Some kind of old DOS version with a key pair generator, that would make keys, and show them (maybe print out to paper wallet)? Can this be useful?

Chunk it to cold storage addresses with 1000 btc in each of them or even less. There will be 200 addressees. Each of them should be backed up at least once, so it's 400 keys. Spread paper keys in banks and other places.
Or maybe distribute the value in some linear\exponential manner in addresses, so i can use small ones and keep eyes out of the bigger ones.

No. Public Address is a "hash" (Encrypted version) of Private Key.

Then bitcoin will go to other countries. 
That's assuming, countries actually compete with each other and there is no "global conspiracy" theater. If conspiracy theorists are right, it will be banned all over the world by marking it is as a "terrorist's currency". A couple of "inside jobs" will do the trick.
There are who hope, that it won't be banned and bankers cartel will just let some puny bank executive hop on a bitcoin train, but i personally doubt it very much. Most likely such CEO would commit suicide, because his life is truly unbearable.
So, yeah... imo, most likely they will ban it. But even if so, cryto will become a "global grey market".

From Russia. We also have laws against casino-zones, and any casino-like machines are prohibited in Moscow. Yet in every minor shop there are ones, they just named "lottery machines". There is nothing "lottery" about them, and it just sits there in plain view for every police officer to see.
Russian authorities make arrests only when they want to make a loud statement, or when police wants to make money (or fill the gaps in there crime-solvement schedule).
There is very upside-down situation with the law here. It's are written , yes. Enforced in a proper way? Not so much.
There is always bunch of loopholes and corruption. So yeah. They can throw you to jail. There are laws against money surrogates. They also can throw you into jail for other reasons, (it's said, sometimes, you discover this reasons in the process for the first time yourself). BTC-E almost did not react on the Central Bank message. They will react only when an arrest will happen. I think btc-users are too puny for govt for now. But even if they will start really enforcing it - somehow there is always a way.

nah... they will not ban a brand. You can ban a brand if there is some centralized company like paypal. just to scare them. 
this technology is decentralized and the technology as a whole can be banned. I'm sure they banned scavenging radioactive materials, working with viruses and hazardous chemistry. That's technologies too. The difference is that these technologies can harm people directly, yes. But with drugwar they took a step further: money laundering. Laundering money does not do any harm to people directly (drug selling does), yet ML is illegal. This is exactly what they are preparing to do with bitcoin now.

For the next big bubble you need a lot of liquidity. And regulators made a statement with Shrem and hearings. So, everybody, who have appropriate money to boost liquidity stay away. It's because they know perfectly well, that govt woun't let bitcoin just happen. They will fight it ruthlessly. So there is no incentive for big players to invest.
I just hope there will be enough common folk to be brave enough to deal in bitcoin after ban and keep price going up. Even if the upward trend will be very slow.

yes. if someone has PrivKey, passwords will not help. PrivKey is the ultimate password, that can be used anywhere.
