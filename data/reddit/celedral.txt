I had the postal guy asking for the item I purchased through purse because the seller requested the item back. Was told his manager asked him to do it and insisted this never happened before. I told him I already opened the envelope and it less than $10, but he insisted he needed to see the packaging envelope. After several attempts digging through my trash can, we found it. Not worth it in my opinion on small purchases.

The amount of effort put into this post will be the same amount of enthusiasm you'll receive.

Why not. The easiest and cheapest option would be to buy amazon gift cards using BTC at 20% off. Accumulate enough GC, then buy the car.

When I click open in external wallet it automatically opens up Mycelium, so i deleted that, then it opened up Copay. Deleted that as well, and now it opens Circle. How do I set it to bread wallet instead?

That's pretty long for what was suppose to be a 10min block.

This is probably from coinbase closing accounts relating to LBTC. People need ways to accumulate.

shiiiizzzz. I'm closing in on 20k in btc purchases through coinbase/chase. What's weird was they blocked my wire transfer to Edison for online payments, then issued an apology letter 2 months later.

Me and a few friends decided to stop by Vegas after our camping trip. I didn't bring much money nor did I bother to bring my CC/DC. Luckily I had some btcs on my phone and asked if my friend could drive to the D so I could make a "quick" withdraw. Finding the ATM wasn't hard and everything seemed to be laid out with simplicity. 
Now this is where It got complicated, well at least time consuming. I had to enter my phone number, then create a pin, verify text message, followed by my palm print, then my ID. After doing this I thought I was ready to go.....not quite. Had to wait 5mins for an approval.
Once I got the approval I hopped back on to the ATM, but by now my friends were a bit bored and anxious to leave. Now I click "Sell Bitcoins" and popped in my phone number, pin, then palm print. Agree to the HUGE spread in buy/sell price and got a receipt printed with a QR code. At first I thought I had to scan the QR code, but that was actually for use later on. I scanned the QR code on the screen then clicked finished.
This took me back to the home screen and I was a bit confused by what to do next, so I looked at the ATM and receipt for more directions. Now I had to click on REDEEM TICKET, which seems to be the final step in this journey I was sent on. I popped in my phone number, pin, and palm print again and scanned my ticket. It then had a screen which shows "withdraw $XXX", which I clicked.
Here comes my money.........not quite again. It shows that I had 0/1 confirmation and come back when it's been confirmed. We waited another 25mins before I got my first confirmation. Finally when I saw that first confirmation I repeated the last step again and got my $xxx.
Total time to completion about 40mins depending on confirmation time. I'm glad that there is a btc option, but just hope for a better experience or possibly an easier experience.
TL:DR took too long to sell bitcoins.

Wow. Newegg is really exploiting the mining community. First their mining packages which are awfully overpriced. Now this.

DAMN. I missed it by minutes.
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:00:05
Maybe Newegg knows something we don't. Like if the price would soon BOOM, which is why all these heavy discounts are coming into play. I wonder if they are holding any % of btc.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:25:07
In no way was this your fault. Man, that's such a nasty experience.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:22:42
Um yeah. I said I was "buying" a car with bitcoins, which implies that I'm using it as a Currency. Not sure if you had coins in gox or just having a bad day, but we are on the same team here. 
You're also lying to yourself if you think you are only in it for the good of seeing bitcoin as a currency. 99% of the people here want to see their coins appreciate.

Thanks for the info. Well it was only about $17 at the time of send, but it was more about the possibility of reoccurrence. Any idea how long it would usually take to return these bits?
@_date: 2014-12-18 07:13:00
Yup, now I have to use a web browser to see how much btc i'm getting instead of $. Really bad move on their part since we can't see the correlation between the two.

Just sent $25 from my android BTC wallet, showed up as $23.75 on coin pocket. Forgot what the exact .xxx btc at the time was, but that's a pretty hefty fee. Even changing to coin desk from coinbase price in the settings showed $24.00.

It's happening. The retaliation from the banks with the belief that bitcoin is a threat. I still don't understand how it's risky if you are purchasing "property" that is by no means illegal. 
Not sure how to feel about this. It's just a matter of time before my acct is next.

I had a few pending charges on my account that's unrelated to coinbase, that's been pending for a few days. I'm thinking they are also putting a hold on my acct at the moment. Even deposits are talking a bit longer.

You paid the full amount upfront? Try Fivver, it starts at $5 and you can expedite the process for a bit more without sketchy anonymous people. 
Been scammed a few times before so I know the feelz. Take it as a paid lesson.
@_date: 2014-11-27 23:12:15
Not even much. The bitcoinblackfriday site didn't work half the time and deals weren't attractive with the limited selections. Some of the best deals were from major retailers, who offered a much more appealing shopping experience without btc. I really wanted to use my btc this week, but haven't found anything enticing or incentivizing to use it on.

I don't think there were much selling pressure this week. There were very little incentives for using btc at any or most shops that take them. I could be wrong too, but after meticulously looking for stuff to buy with btc I was only able to spend  0.13 btc at best. Honestly it was way more easier to get good deals this year with CC than it is with btc.

I usually pay the standard fees and never skimp, since I had a transaction get stuck in limbo one time. I don't think any iOS wallet have selectable fees. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:34:24
Had the same experience, as stated before in your previous post. They just stop responding to me completely. I just ignore it now. There are way too many glitches on their site too. I lost quite a bit when they don't place my second bet in BJ, leading to a loss in the hand. I even see glitches where another player ended up hitting on a 20.
@_date: 2015-05-23 13:22:41
Bad luck in deed. As much as I love btc, Confirmations can be a pain in the ass, especially if the merchant requires 2-3 confirmations. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:07:07
So this "Bitcoin Commercial", when is it going to happen again?
@_date: 2015-05-23 12:47:45
I thought the days of waiting on my computer screen was over when I upgraded to a 300mb/s line. I use to think 20minutes was long waiting for a confirmation, but this is just outrageous. If only these weren't time sensitive transactions, I wouldn't be so stressed about it. 
Any idea what could be causing the delay? Possibly network congestion? And yes I did pay the fees.
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:41:35
Where are you located by the way?
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:59:19
I waited at least 30-40mins before sending the second transaction, which means the first one was already heavily delayed. But thanks for the insight.

Made a smaller withdraw and it went through, still waiting for my 1btc+ withdraw. It's pretty lame how they use one of the fastest payment methods, yet process them at the same rates as standard payments. Let's be hopeful that they process yours soon, being as it's a large amount. Congrats on winning that much, my luck would not allow me to hit anything over 1k+

My experience has been 4/6 orders would go smoothly, the others would either get cancelled, returned to sender, or take 2weeks to arrive. I've had orders that was out for delivery then immediately get request back to sender. I'm sure this is due to all the "bad" amazon GC that goes through Purse.

Renewal is $32 for me. Originally paid with btc for $35.
