sharedKey - Because a User's password is not shared with our server an alternative method is needed to prove ownership of a wallet. Upon creation a unique 36 character random key is generated by the users browser, this is used as password when authenticating a wallet identifier with the server.
That identifier is emailed to you so you have it saved.  Your browser will remember it, but you will need it to log in elsewhere

Agree that this is not cool, I would (and I do) use coinbase to purchase btc and send it to another wallet.  DO NOT use coinbase as your primary wallet

more of a reason to switch to mBTC...people like whole numbers
