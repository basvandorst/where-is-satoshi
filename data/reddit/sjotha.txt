@_date: 2019-07-19 11:22:37

Always when you think the crypto world is maturing a bit, articles like this show how stupid a large portion still is. Man this article was bad.
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:57:31
Oh wow because a random on reddit said he knows someone that thinks BTC will rise, i will now definitely buy more BTC!

Only thing you need to know about this subreddit is, be nice to crypto get karma
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:59:10
Can someone explain what this does exactly? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:39:04
Yes this is true
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:07:37
If you read the article it said that stolen crypto's from exchanges because of hacks is the biggest part of it not ransomware.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:38:06
BTC is on its way to become the worlds most stolen currency lol. I believe in BTC but this article and statement make no point at all ';)

Cant find the article about it, but here is an interesting one just about the first half of 2018

Here is a youtube video where they do the same sort of experiment with people:

Klein = small
Schaal = scale
 
# "on a small scale"
*adjective*The definition of on a small scale is a minor effort made, or something done, on a micro level when the reality is much bigger.
*If you are taking up farming but you only plant a one or two plants, this is an example of farming on a small scale.*
On the part how to pronounce it..... maybe someone else knows how to do this part ;)

Yep, a step to make btc more mainstream is not having prices like this for an event. Now i do understand that they have a lot of expenses but these prices just dont add up.
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:43:39
Why would you not read the terms before using a service like that?
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:48:44
I just love how crypto investors think 20-30% movement in a year is "healthy growth".
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:31:15
 **€450** for a non student price? That's just BS for an event
