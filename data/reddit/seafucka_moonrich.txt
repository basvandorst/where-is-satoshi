im guessing the lack of response means, without asic bitcoin would completely be gone.

hence why it hasn't happened yet.

My biggest concern with lighting is that it seems to push bitcoin into more centralization. Because intermediaries need to have more money than the transaction you are executing, inevitably bank like institutions will form in order to store enough bitcoin so that they can serve as channels for millions of people. It defeats the purpose of bitcoin, there has to be another way.

It's only a matter of time before some new start-up overtakes coinbase's market dominance.

My only worry is not buying before the trend reverses.

I appreciate this response, and yes I realize in such an event there will be much bigger problems, this is simply a question of resilience. 
Basically how likely is it that BTC would be destroyed in the future as apposed to other stores of value such as gold, government bonds and precious commodities. 
It sounds to me like, as long as there is a copy of the blockchain on even one, working computer, bitcoin can still work(when the difficulty decreases). 
As a side note, is difficulty set by the bitcoin protocol and if I wanted to change the protocol is there anyway to do it without forking bitcoin? Also when does difficulty go down?
~~I presume it's when no one is able to successfully "mine" a new block by the end of bitcoins block cycle being 2016 blocks. Also our blocks produced on a schedule or depending on need? This wasn't clear in the whitepaper.~~edit: nevermind
