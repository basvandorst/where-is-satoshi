Altcoins could be being used. Many have sub usd0.01 transaction fees.

Bitcoin is like 0.003% of M3. We've got a long mother fucking way to go.

Diversified my btc at 18k. Only lost 10% in the dip AMA.

Look at the futures markets if you want real answers.

The extra information they're collecting is *valuable.o

So far so good. Coinbase is *like* a bank. They'll exchange your hard cash for bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. Their rates suck. On the exchanges I watch coinbase always hits ATHs (all time highs) first or close to it. If they weren't so slow arbitrageurs could make so much more than they already do there preying on the noobs and small businesses using them. They're slow to process payments and are notorious for fucking with withdrawals and exchange rates due to their slow processing. 




Its not that black and white man. If you know you want to buy a certain coin and don't want to get reamed the big exchanges are the place to do it. Check them on coinmarketcap.com . With that being said no one should be lending/trading on margin/dealing in futures unless they already have experience, know fully well how much money they'll lose in a worst case scenario and can afford to lose that money. In short never put money in crypto that you cannot afford to lose. Never take a loan for crypto that you cannot afford to pay back in full after taking a total loss of your entire crypto portfolio. These people taking hundred thousand dollars of debt to buy btc or altcoins or mining farms are going to get fucked. Maybe not right away. Maybe not all of them. But many will. r/markmywords




If you care about anonymity then don't deal in btc at all. Use the small coins, the small flybynight exchanges, the 0 auth exchanges, a system of washing between multiple privacy centered coins (monero, zcash, zcoin, zerocoin or cash), tumblers, wash trading, and obscured atomic swaps. Don't get your initial crypto startup through any traceable means. Don't even talk about crypto to anyone ever after your source your start up. I won't talk about cashing out. You'll have plenty of time to think about that as you're figuring out how to minimize all your tracks to obscurity. I can go on but if you're as serious about privacy as life in prison you need to be doing this and much more. If you're not you're not only going to get caught and have your entire history read aloud like a book. The reality is most people don't need absolute anonymity. The reality is that in 2-3 decades or less this cryptography could get broken and still expose everyones transactions. We've already seen some exploits towards this. 


As we've seen with nicehash just because an exchange is big doesn't mean they're immune to security exploits, internal theft, or exit scams. Also read about mt gox if you're still not sure why exchanges are bad. 
Emphasis addrd. 
  


Diversify your risk and use multiple exchanges. No one should ever have more than 10% of their portfolio on an exchange for any significant (24+ hours) period of time.

So blockchain.info should be avoided by everyone. Got it.

These antagonistic posts are hilarious.
