Support journalism. But not like shitty broadcast journalism, but quality investigative reporting. Maybe a journalism school or something.

Why do people value gold over other metals? We have the technology to make tungsten or platinum look nearly identical to gold. So, what makes gold valuable? The fact that it’s rare, hard to get, and we assigned a lot of value to it. What makes some artwork incredibly expensive? Because some humans said this piece of artwork is unique by some criteria — first of its kind, a well known artist, or some other quality. And it’s sold, maybe at an auction where a bunch of humans want it, but there is only one available (demand &gt; supply).
Bitcoin has those same qualities. It’s rare, you can’t magically make more outside the mining parameters. And some people want to own it. That demand outstrips supply, and there you go.

OK. You’re holding two fidget spinners, one in each hand, and they are both spinning really fast, so fast they just look like discs and you have no idea which direction either one is spinning. 
If you touch either one (like with your nose or something) you’ll know instantly which way it was spinning because of the gash it will leave on your face. Why the hell did you do that for? 
The good news is that for some unknown reason, you also know which way the other one is spinning without further disfiguring your face, because for some crazy law of nature they were connected the whole time. 
But here is the rub. They weren’t spinning in *either* direction before you stupidly poked your nose on one. Or rather, each spinner was spinning in *both directions* simultaneously. It was only when you stuck your nose where it didn’t belong that they decided they were actually spinning in a particular direction.
Why? Because none of this makes and goddamn sense— just like the infatuation people had with buying fidget spinners.
