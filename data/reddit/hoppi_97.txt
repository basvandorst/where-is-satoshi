Unfortunately, I'm on iOS and don't have Eclair. I hope someone can help you.
Did you maybe have bitcoin testnet enabled in your bitcoin.conf before and now it's downloading the mainnet blockchain?
Also, maybe it's just the lightning node syncing up with the blockchain. This usually takes a few hours.

Of course, a raspberry pi is not mandatory. It's just cheap, minimal and saves on energy consumption. That's why I chose it. If you have old computers laying around, I would also probably use them if I was you.
If your full node is running on linux, you could just head to the "Lightning" section of the tutorial I posted in the OP and get started.
I'm not sure about Windows servers, but I think there will be other tutorials for setting up lightning on those :)

Will definitely do! I look at it everytime I walk through my apartment so I don't think I'm gonna neglect it :)
Good luck with yours as well.

There's a section about port forwarding with IPv4 in most guides. Port forwarding is not necessary with IPv6 anymore. But most routers do have an IPv6 firewall. You have to allow traffic for the necessary ports (8333, 18333, 9735) with your node.

Sounds good :)
If you want to save some trouble with your wife, you could also setup a ssh connection so you can connect to your node from another PC without using an HDMI cable.

Yeah this setting is very important. Thanks for the heads up, I just edited it into the post!
