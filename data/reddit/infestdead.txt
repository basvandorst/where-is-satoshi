Do you understand what decentralization means? Everyone can say anything, it shouldn't matter. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:17:47
gpg has user interface - what do you think it encrypts files with magic and fabricates passwords?
    gpg2 -c file.sth
    [enter password twice]
    shred -uv file.sth [to shred/delete the file]
    mv file.sth /to/backup/path
    when you need to dercrypt:
    gpg2 file.sth
    [enter password twice]
I don't get what's the big overwhelming complication that you need a USER INTERFACE.
Use whatever you like, it's a free world of course. For your needs you can winzip with a pass it's all the same.

what you are looking at is estimations and predictions:
predictions on difficulty and price, those are known to change.

What you can and can't be fucked with doesn't change the type and quality of the software you are using. 
I'll say it again - use whatever you like.

This has to be the most one-sided discussion I've ever seen.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:20:54
most keylogger can't process keystrokes from a VM, some probably can I'm not an expert - if you are that paranoid - use a separate laptop and power it on only via live cd + virtualbox etc etc.
There are many layers of security/obscurity you can add it all comes down to - where does it all stop being useful and becomes cumbersome.

don't save the screenshot as png, encrypt it with gpg for example and a good pass and you are all set
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:14:17
clean install of latest fedora (encrypted)
download bitcoin client
create new wallet
encrypt immediately
let it sync
transfer funds
backup wallet.dat but just in case encrypt one more time with gpg2 with a different password
all passwords - for VM, wallet, gpg2 store only in memory - don't write them anywhere
if you need to use BTC, fire up VM, let it sync a bit, send coins

1. screenshot the QR when you enter setup GA
2. save it
3. encrypt it (gpg for example)
4. store offline
5. if the works happens - decrypt and setup GA with that barcode on another phone
@_date: 2018-10-05 09:57:10
That's true, but still -&gt; 
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:41:40
Got it, thanks for the detailed explanation. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:20:10
Isn't that more of a "total unique number of peers my node saw since X" instead of number of currently online full nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:21:37
OK if we agree that bitcoin should be able to do lots of transactions, have reasonable fees, that means it should scale, because right now everyone can agree fees are high, and transactions are slow. And you are saying that block size increase is not that? If not - what is?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:35:11
I'm running a bitcoin full node and it's right now - 123GB, network bandwidth is negligible. Everyone that can't afford that can run something like the bitcoin android wallet, no?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:25:54
If the issue is that block increase will make bitcoin nodes 100TB, then wouldn't LN nodes become 100TB? I mean does LN just move the small transactions to another type of node or how does it happen?
Does this mean if I want a "full" node in the current sense of the word, I need to run bitcoin+LN node?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:06:26
OK but who operates the lightning network hardware? I assume a 3rd party. So the bitcoin blockchain is no longer available to all and independent. I mean, I don't have issue with somebody developing that, and users having the option to use it, but it should in not way be the way bitcoin scales, it's a bit like saying - we'll let Visa handle some of the transactions - they know what they do and have capacity. Or am I misunderstanding something?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:27:12
Is there anywhere I can get more info on this?
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:43:07
Grow up.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:07:55
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:57:15
Where do you get your data from?
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:42:44
Yes I know, but not what I asked. If bitcoin forks - 90% move to chain A, 10% remain on chain B - is that bad? I don't think it is.
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:44:30
What is the reason behind this, any more info?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:50:18
OK, but if we want every person in the world to be able to run a full node, then we need to start from scratch, right? There are countries much worse than the Philippines where people don't even have access to water, so how do they run a full node? Your point is very very flawed. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:46:07
So by your standards only ~7000 people in the world are using bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:23:56
OK I guess that makes sense. So for example every site will use a payment processor, and every payment processor will use their own LN nodes? So LN will be like banks basically that will settle on the blockchain every now and then?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:38:46
Yes I get that, but zero confirmation transactions are still fine for the small stuff. I mean I've bought stuff like HumbleBundle for example and they always took my money on zero confirmations. Is that a problem?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:23:29
SegWit seems so much more than block size increase, and large part of bitcoiners are seem to want just that. I want to understand why a simple block-size increase is not good enough and we need segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:09:22
I do run a full node. Does anybody else come to the same numbers?
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:07:01
Can you provide more info on this?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:19:15
Yes but is that bad? I mean people can choose the coin they prefer.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:42:17
I guess that's the big issue, people can't agree on anything. 
The definition of majority is indeed a very tricky question. Is it users (abs numbers), or users weighted over amount of bitcoins owned, is it hashrate or commit access to the core repo? Or all of the above. IDK :)
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:16:44
Can it be fixed without SegWit?
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:43:59
OK but LN is not peer to peer so not really bitcoin, correct?
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:39:45
I don't think anyone has ever said that. Faster in terms of right now (full blocks) - yeah sure - they will be faster. But they can't be faster than 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:54:27
OK I need to read more in LN, seems I don't understand it well enough.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:10:54
Aside from that, let say everyone holds hands, sings Kumbaya, and agrees on block size increase. Why is that bad? That's the thing I don't get.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:33:20
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:46:08
I don't mean a rouge increase, but what if everyone agrees on say 3MB - what happens then? Bitcoin has forked before, if the majority agrees on the new rules it shouldn't be an issue.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:10:12
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:51:48
Can you explain? Why won't it speed up confirmations?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:43:32
Where, in the debug.log?
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:08:44
Are you referring to this:
The vulnerability has not been patched in Bitcoin Core. The reason for their failure to do so remains unclear. Jeffrey says he informed them 2 months ago. Sachets took two days to implement the patch, he says, while Bitcoin Core still hasn’t at the time of writing.
If yes - this is written from the site that you linked, not a quote.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:30:55
Care to link to said interviews?

"BFL will surely deliver, let's just wait..."
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:16:27
yeah about point 3)- I wouldn't back my wallet to Dropbox etc. Even if my password is super strong I would prefer not to have in on amazons server or wherever 3rd party. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:29:38
Yes but what do you prefer - having wallet with strong password in 3rd party's hands - available to test brute force on - or knowing you only have it - AND it's encrypted with a strong password.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:40:52
So it seems this is only worth doing with a large sum of money. With the 1K USD I can come up it, it's a lot of hustle with very little profit margin (if any) after all the fees.
@_date: 2013-02-27 12:51:27
True, but what I can gather from the forums it's 50/50. If you complain on the BFL forums etc you get refunded, if you are just a regular joe writing emails - they probably go to /dev/null.
@_date: 2013-02-27 07:59:54
**it's a scam**
just think about it. If they were able to produce those devices with that hashing powers, why not just plug them into some pool and start mining? They would be making tons of money. Current total hash speed of bitcoin is estimated around 30K GH/s. They claim they have a machine able to do 1.5K GH/s? So all they need is 20 of their OWN machines that they claim to have and they will be mining as much as the rest of the whole world? With 20 tower sized PCs!?
Sorry for you, but I'd bet you anything you will never get what you paid for, if you did it won't be within the specs that are on the site.
Also google "butterfly labs scam" and check up on their owner Josh Zerlan - he has been accused of scam before and did time for that.
Also wonder why they don't do refunds? :) Just try it - ask them if you can get a full refund - your request will be denied.
@_date: 2013-02-27 18:44:26
I agree. Still for me they are shady, their deadlines change all the time, the specs are too good to be true, no proof of concept product even, so I'll pass.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:07:58
Something is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it. That's it. Also US dollar is not backed up by anything except the Federal Reserve promises.
@_date: 2013-02-27 09:22:51
From their FAQ:
**Can I get a refund on my pre-order?**
Butterfly Labs, INC. is accepting pre-orders for ASIC based products, expected to begin shipping in late October or early November 2012. Your pre-order with payment confirms your place in line for delivery once we begin shipping. Payments made for pre-orders of ASIC based products now under development should be considered non-refundable until products begin shipping or 1 January 2013, whichever is earlier.

why would I pay a website 0.1BTC/year when I can download keepassx for free and use that, and sync the encrypted db file using owncloud, dropbox, whatever? I don't get it, can someone that uses this website care to explain why is it better?
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:43:15
Wow, installed and sync took 30 seconds - now I'm up to date and can send/receive coins.
How does this work, and can it be implemented in bitcoin-qt client?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:22
probably DoS-ed by users going F5 like crazy and trying t sell/buy
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:24:33
From the article, the "Surveillance-Resistance" part. 
What does the author mean that transaction can be tracked backed to the person that made them? AFAIK the address sending money and the address receiving money is public, but that's about it. Also you can generate new address for each transaction. Anyone know what's he's on about?
@_date: 2013-02-27 11:10:33
You are probably right, when I first stumbled across BFL, I googled around and wrote them of as total scam, the number are just too good to be true, and lots of shady things in their past. 
Again if they ever produce a product, I'd bet anything it won't be with the specs on the site, it's just not possible to do 60GH/s at 60 watts. The next mining rig even close to this is Avalon ASIC that's 10 times worse in power efficiency. Sorry but I don't buy it.
