Yeh mate, i dont have any ! which was one of the problems, no one was impressed with $1.50 worth i had and i couldn't  say how you got more because i still struggling with that one myself. but saying that i think it a pretty cool thing to have on your phone, it just a shame i the only 1!

i clicked the collect, got directed to changetip, signed me up with reddit. i also got another tip too!  one thing ,earlier on a thing about which wallet to have it said online wallets was the most risky, this a online right? not that bothered as i not going to have much but it ok untill i get a electrum (that seems like the most recommended)

i wondered why this post had so many comments. then i saw the beers.
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:37:37
cheers i will check them out another time. i not sure if this for me. maybe come back when things are more established .
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:46:17
i a sucker. i bet on the zero.
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:28:02
hi mate. i got the myceleium (from play store) i wrote down the code and then typed it into the withdraw bit of changetip ( that a code and a half! real careful but i hope i typed  it right.) moved 1mbit.any idea how long it takes? shit i hope i got that code right!!
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:33:11
maybe it felt sorry for me and didnt want me to suffer a million bee stings on my hairy ball bag
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:57:23
i not going to be hasty. i going to forget buying any for now and just follow it and read up more. is it ok if i still collect the changetip bitcoin you sent? 
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:43:10
no one listening to you sleazebag
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:46:10
because they dont have any btc to spend. i am finding it hard to find spare money to invest in btc and i dont think i am alone. most people are finding it hard just to pay the bills and put food on the table. with no spare money it impossible to buy any btc. if i can not buy any btc i can not spend any btc.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:57:13
ok i spent last 20 mins or so reading beginners but even those posts seem to assume you already know stuff and the more you read the more confusing  it gets. some of the posts seem to contradict  other posts. i need a very simple 1 page guide that assumes i know nothing.
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:18:44
south coast. nearest are London or bristol,both would be a day round trip and the petrol!
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:26:46
Yeh i take the time to see what it is and if it for me and maybe buy a little to try it out. the reception i get from some is "im a idiot"! why because  i find when i look into it that getting said currency is actually not very easy and quite costly after paying festering and stuff. i not a troll. i someone who new.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:58:32
brilliant , fuckin grammar police. lick my hairy ball bag
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:17:41
shudders at the thought of a beehive on my ballbag 
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:19:06
with your username i not sure i want to click that link !
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:08:14
i just seen the beer tip thing ( didnt get 1 boo!) i know how to entice them now !!! 
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:54:25
i going to stick with it but forget about buying some and getting a wallet and stuff. just read up on it and follow it for a few days and see. i am interested but the reaction i git from a few people pissed me off a bit. from a new person walking in the door i promise you it seems easy for the first 10 seconds but gets more confusing the more you read.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:15:16
cheers mate, i feeling like millionaire ! meeting up with a few mates for a couple ales tonight. cant wait to show them the myceleium app! you been a star mate, helping me get started. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:40:13
that good of you singular but i new and just looking into it, i dont have a wallet .
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:17:29
mate, can you cancel it? i not going to bother with it, i only wanted to see what it was about and maybe get 10 maybe 20 quid worth but well it more hassle than it worth.
@_date: 2014-07-22 14:11:20
how bitcoin can stop war ? what a load of blocks. i waiting for my inbox to fill with " grow your cock with bitcoin and buy viagra with bitcoin. bitcoin can do many things but stopping wars is not one of them.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:12:01

@_date: 2014-07-23 15:11:54

wow cheers mate. you just more than tripled my stash!! sorry to be slow in thanking you. i only started yesterday. just got the wallet and i waiting to see if it has moved from the changetip to the wallet. keeping fingers crossed i typed the code right.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:27:21

@_date: 2014-05-30 22:07:49
50k. well fuckin good for you. Thats right i dont know how to buy it, and yes you know more about it than i do, holy shit!! you get back to your trading desk Mr wall street.
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:28:30
when you have something as well known as a big mac that is equal to 100 bits or 50 bits it stupid but it does make it much more appealing to the general public. people like round numbers. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:42:27
its there!!! it said it could  be hours when i sent it. mate Thats pretty cool. another question, under it it says 3 confirmation?
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:36:48

@_date: 2014-06-06 16:11:15
you would need to have small hands for a 10 knuckle!
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:25:18
sure, i in no rush. the problem is the more i read posts the more confusing it gets. none of my friends are into it. i in UK and i get the impression it mote of a US thing. i also struggle to see how i can even get hold of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:34:58
i open to except a tip, as long as it not the tip of your dick.
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:25:59

@_date: 2014-06-01 14:58:42
ha ha ! they a good bunch of lads. i was just a bit disappointed they was not as excited about it as i was.
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:16:07
now is not the time to buy. am Skint, 4 new tires on the car and a heavy credit card says not the time to buy. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:34:03
i have given up talking to friends about it :(  i did try but almost always the reaction was negative :(
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:15:03

@_date: 2014-06-29 20:50:54

@_date: 2014-07-05 13:19:31
i would be very happy to have a few extra bits!
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:32:31
localbitcoins . find a stranger online and then meet up with them holding a bundle of cash. brilliant . look, i not here to slag off your bitcoin thing. i just expected it to be a lot more straight forward. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:31:28
i can go into any high street and get euros  or usd  instantly and have a wide choice of places to do so. you are a idiot if you believe it as easy to buy bitcoins. Fuck sake.as easy as  buying a foreign  currency. lol 
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:04:00
but which wallet ? i not going to be buying much as the price is on a up, want to wait untill it settles ( yes it could keep going up and up in which case i may regret my cautious  attitude but i new to this) maybe £100 -£150. i will back it up for sure, to a usb? the laptop is hardly used so i think it safe and like i said i just dont feel confident i know how to make paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:26:01
that a huge sum of money mate, 1) you lucky to have that amount of btc and 2)  you lucky to have got them back. take care of your assets .
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:00:22
i am new. have spent much longer than 20 mins now. still see no easy way to buy bitcoin. not in US. in UK. how is this the currency of the future if it unavailable to the average guy ? or you need a 2 day course on how to use it?
