Good call!
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:38:37
You are right. I am making changes to the site daily, and I understand this will help with trust.
I am going to push a bunch of changes tonight, and I will make sure this is on the top of my list.
Let me know if you think of anything else!

Hey, I'm the site admin. In addition to Steam codes i am also starting to add other video game products (ie. minecraft gift codes, origin games, etc).
If this is confusing or makes the site look sketch, I will add a note at the top! 
Thanks for letting me know!

lol! I also thought it was a little ridiculous.

Site admin here, we had an issue with mtgox and an issue with getting games from steam, but both have since been resolved. I am kind of a reddit newb so I see that I have an inbox full of messages (no email alerts?). At any rate, best way to reach me is support
Let me know if you have any questions!
@_date: 2013-08-04 08:06:41
Done!  :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:13:03
Okay, I will look into this. There is other stuff (like DLC) that I don't want to get into yet. But the bundles might make sense to offer.

Don't forget about SteamBits.com! For all your video game needs :)

If it makes you feel better, I bought the "Steam" version of Far Cry 3 from steam when the game first came out. To my surprise, when I hit 'play' in steam, all it did was launch uPlay. Kind of made me laugh  :(
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:18:53
Yeah, everyone has a million of them lately. I have 15 steam gifts just sitting in my account. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 05:39:54
Check out [SteamBits.com]( to buy Steam games and more!
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:05:21
Well, it really depends on what game you are talking about. Most games I have listed are significantly cheaper than buying from steam. Take a look through the 'On Sale' items.

Hi clfblackhawk,
That rule is for our original social sportsbook offering and not for the bitcoin sportsbook.  
Thanks for bringing this to our attention though, we should probably go through and update the rules!
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:19:58
I wasn't offering the Steam version at that time, but I am now! :)

In general, sound advice. On our homepage you can browse through the profiles of some of our top members and see their actual betting history for the last few months. I have tried BTCSportsBet.com and it is a great site as well!
