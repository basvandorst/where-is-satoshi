Beside power consumption will cost you more than you can make in mining, a 1000$ mining equipment thingy will be obsolete in a few years.  
If you need a yearround heating and electrical is the cheapest option, it might pay some of the expenses back.   
A quality heater will last longer, be more silent and in the end be cheaper too.  
A better option would probably be to just buy bitcoins at a dip, and hodl for some months and then sell.

It probably won't hit 10K$ before new-year. Its all over.  Sell and buy prepper gear.

...and not selling at 1500, before it drops back to 300 or less.

Isn't it about time some (small) fraction of the fees got distributed to nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:24:47
That's true, and it aint funny

Buy a metal detector. Go to a popular beach in the winter time. Bring a minecraft foampickaxe, so you look cool while mining the beach for metal. Sell the stuff you find on the beach. 10 times more profit than from  mining with asic hardware.

And they can't wait until "It happens", the internet is gone, and mining is done by hand. Pen and paper.

True, and beside fake nodes, anonymity should also be preserved.  
All nodes would have to have a buildin address for receiving fees.  
The actual work of distributing blocks and transactions, would have to be proven to all peers of a node.  
Aaaaaaaaand now i have reached way beyond my own knowledge of how blockchain work... :)

BCH is dipping close to 1 K$, and i'm fine with that.

I think the start time of this dump exercise, was carefully selected. In Europe it was around noon Friday, afternoon to evening in Asia, and early morning in the US.   
The first hours of the attack, was the last hours before the weekend. With this timing, most of the financial institutions/banks did only see a big dip, before closing for the weekend.  
So a big part of the market has been unable to react to, what looked like a somewhat unusual big dip, but turned out to be an attack. Monday morning, everywhere, will be somewhat hectic. Tuesday morning the attack will be over.  
This is guesswork and gutfeeling:  Next Friday: BTC 6.5-7 K$, BCH 0.8-1.1 K$ Eth 0.3-0.4K$
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:16:35
it hit $8315 on bitfinex 9 hours ago.

I agree. You have to wait a minute to see if a trade/order is done, and usually you have to redo it 2-6 times befor it works.
