The 24 words seed is used to generate everything.
The apps are software with currency specific implementation details on the transaction format and so on.
You are limited to a few apps at the same time, but you can deinstall and reinstall apps. And obviously, you don't lose coins when you deinstall the app!
So the Ledger can manage all the coins that are compatible with the BIP44 norm. As long as there is an app for them.

I agree with a large part.
But you are really really wrong when you compare coal mining in the XIXth century to MacDonalds. Really really wrong.

George Washington was a racist, a sexist, a transphobe, an homophobe and a slave owner.

Cash isn't rising. Only Bitcoin. So it means either lots of shit investors or manipulation. Otherwise, other cryptos would rise too if balanced investors were jumping in.

True HODLers kept both their BTC and BCH all this time.
To diversify and avoid the risk of BTC committing suicide due to abusive fees. Big blocks + Segwit, why can't we get both ?

The seed is highly redundant as it's words.
Unless you made an error with the order of words, you are fine.
Loading a seed isn't a dangerous task. Don't be so afraid.
If you are really afraid, load the set on another hardware wallet first!

The wealth of nerds has always been high. They were in electrical engineering, then in electronic engineering and today in software engineering.
Nothing really changes.

25€ per transaction is already insanely expensive ... And it will get worse and worse.

In France, in 2010, Polytechnique had 30 CEOs out of the 100 CEOs of the largest French corporations. Polytechnique is a math &amp; physics school (French MIT), with very little focus on business.
Ok, it's not as much nerdy as tech is, but it still was a lot nerdy.

Yep. A good chunk of Bitcoin early adopters were tech engineers who understood that it was a great technology. Those people are in the top10% or better.
It's mostly wealth redistribution from rich to slightly less rich.

What about bitstamp ?

At 100k$ it's still 500M$. Enough to have some fun.

Meanwhile, there will be 3x more users.
Due to the sterile war between small blockers and by big blockers, we end up with small block segwit and big block non segwit, instead of having a unified BTC with both big blocks and segwit.

It depends what you call a bubble.
It's an adoption rush. It happens at every wave with bitcoin.
x15 in 3 months then /3 in the next month. Overall x5.

Tocqueville famously explained that in a democracy people would always complain because some have more than you do.
We are indeed rich like crazy, but we feel bad because somenare even better off.
Minimum wage in developed countries is the equivalent of 500 energy slaves.

During boom times, Sundays are sell time as bank transfers from amateurs are waiting.
Price goes up during the week as people swarm in. Prices go down during the weekend as old players sell some funds when they are at home.

Powerful nerds don't care as much about net neutrality.
Also, the Trump hatred coming from Silicon Valley and other big metropolises played a large part in the assault on Net Neutrality. It's political payback.
Silicon Valley has been contaminated by the SJW hysteria and unfortunately, nerds don't seem to dare to tell them to fuck off. Google engineers don't dare to oppose the SJW priesthood. Remember James Demore. And Oculus Palmer Luckey being punished by Facebook from being pro-Trump.

It's evolving very smoothly actually.
In 2013, there was the crash when the Chinese government semi-banned it.
Today, big financial corporations and mumbling and grumbling while at the same time rushing to be the first to provide financial products based on Bitcoin.

Why ? It's extremely clear that TEDx events are independent events.

Are there not financial products designed to short ? That's what futures are about.

The percentage keeps growing and is a very unhealthy level. Though I didn't invest in crypto currencies in the last 4 years. It's just that the reasonable percentage grew by itself!

The full coiners is also a nice club. Less elitist obviously, but it becomes more and more restrictive as prices go up.

At the start of every video it's written TEDx x = independently organised event.
