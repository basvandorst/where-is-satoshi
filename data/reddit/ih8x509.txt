I was referring to a hard drive failure.  To be more precise:  In the event of a hard-drive failure, all funds since the last backup would be lost, and the user has until his channels start expiring to restore his node.

You appear to mis-understand the issue.  Your statement is true regarding on-chain transactions, all you need is your wallet seed and you're pretty much good to go.  However, my post is regarding the Lightning Network.  Due to the nature of the lightning network, a new backup will have to be made for each payment you receive, and each payment you route (as a hub) because lightning network wallets are stateful.  This is because, via the lightning network, all you have is the cryptographically proven assurance of BTC, a signed transaction from another person.  If you lose that signed transaction, you have lost the funds.  Under LN, these transactions are stored locally, not on the blockchain.

My apologies, I am referring to hard drive failure.  You'll have to set up backups to some external media for it to be useful.  I would be hard-pressed to believe your average user would be willing to go through that much setup at high adoption levels, it's difficult as it is to get new users to just write down a simple wallet seed.

He mentions this for payments less than 1 cent in this article, it's a pretty fringe case that most people would never need to use.  Nevertheless, you are right.  Thanks for answering my question.

I dont treat him like Jesus, I just want to know if it's something he actually said as that's what this thread is about.

Hey, full disclosure: user and big block believer, honest question: can you find the quote where he mentioned 2nd layer solutions?  I've never found a quote where he recommended a second layer solution, as far as I know he only mentioned block size increases.  If there is a quote, I would like to know it for my musing of the scaling debate.

Until the hashing algorithm also breaks. Once that happens, happy mining ;)
