Yes copay is part of bitpay. I highly recommend Samourai. It has segwit and rbf for low fees, which you can manually set.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:59:17
It sounds like a faucet that is funded by you providing market research or ad eyeballs (rather than mining). Just send it to your conbase recieve address, or download a real wallet on your phone (Samourai for Android, green address for iOS) if you want to store it safely and locally
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:44:48
Yes, you can use a wallet that lets you specify your own fee
You can use/support an exchange or wallet that uses segwit for a big fee discount
You can support an exchange that enables transaction batching for big fee discounts

Even if bitmain makes and uses the majority of miners in existence, they still have to sell a portion of their electricity overhead, R&amp;D, infrastructure capital and operational costs. This puts the coins they mine and fees they collect on the open market to be sold.

Cool. Well, you are both right and wrong.
I have a bank account. 
I pay $0 to maintain it per month. 
I pay $0 to withdraw from any atm. 
I pay $0 to receive or send money.
This month, my country is rolling out instant bank-to-bank transfers.
Via my debit card, it is (for me) instant to purchase items, for 'no additional cost'.
Now, that's a good, efficient centralised system. How can a decentralized crypto network compete with it? Bottom line: it can't.
Decentralized layer 1 systems will never be able to outcompete a centralised clearinghouse on either transaction time or fee overheard.
What can they do then? Well, they can do somethings my bank can't. They can be immune to the inflation tax. They can be immune to third party censorship. They can be immune to institutional confiscation.
So its pretty obvious that the value in crypto is not based on how cheap you can buy coffee or how fast, its based on how it can resist takeover attempts to dilute or destroy that utility. By that metric, bitcoin outperforms everything by orders of magnitude. It has the most nodes. The biggest hashrate. The widest infrastructure. The most talented and committed developers. The most fanatical hodlers and users.
It should valued at least 10x its current rate based on its current utility right now, not even factoring in lightning IMO.
Heres a tweet I think is relevant

Except this isn't software. This is pure money or protogold, expressed in a digitised format. It doesn't give a fuck about your fancy new 2018 hashgraph DAG tech that does 250,000 tx a sec, which will in turn be made obsolete in 2020 by quantum resistant cloud fuzzy protocol that can do 5 trillion tx a sec.
People just want a system/network that is trusted to store and sometimes move value. It works, it does exactly what it needs to do. Of course the tech is factored in; thats why we pumped massively after segwit was activated in August. But its only a small part of why bitcoin is best coin.

"Why is money laundering such a big deal? Because of fairness. If someone works all her life, creating value, and stores it, then someone comes and just ‘takes’ it, it is unfair, right? "
Author makes the weird argument that cryptos facilitate money laundering, and that money laundering is people coming and taking your money (?).
And yet Bitcoin and many of the cryptos that followed are precisely designed to stop banks (who actually do the money laundering) and governments (who actually seize your value through inflation).

Check your math, it's about $2 for a channel open/close assuming a $20k Bitcoin price and the fee used in this video
Assuming a standard tx size of 226bytes with a 1.3 multiplier for multisig
1.3*226bytes = about 300 bytes for our 2of2 on chain channel open
300 bytes * 16sats/byte = 5,100sats for the fee
0.00005000 * $20,000 = $1
x2 including channel close = $2. Wow.
As for being overly complicated, a good on-chain/lnd hybrid wallet that leverages incentivized third parties to assist and users won't even know they are using lightning.
Do you understand how 4G cellular networks authenticate your subscriber token/keys and route you when you make a call? 
Edit: I see you've used a fee of 200sats/byte. There are currently &gt;10sat/b txs clearing the mempool in 4-5 blocks. With lightning adoption both forcing more segwit update with a subsequent block size increase, and huge amounts of traffic potentially moving offchain, there is no reason to think 16sat/byte isn't as reasonable in the mid term as it is right now

There are cpu-gpu mined coins out there with low hashrate that are mined by two or even a single pool. So the hashing algo does not = decentralised mining.
Bitcoin mining is at least spread out to nearly every continent, and being able to be hashed on an asic gives a ridiculously high security against hashing attacks from conventional botnet clusters or state supercomputing resources. 
Having a high concentration in China and a high concentration in Bitmain manufacturing is a problem, I admit. But its a temporary one, that is not caused by asics and will equalise to fix itself in time.
We've already got huge swathes of mining starting in Japan, Mongolia, Canada and Iceland, and new ASICs from GMO and Halong being released this year.

Mate we still don't know if calculus was invented by Newton, or Leibniz.
How can you trust crossing a bridge that was engineered with calculus with your LIFE if we still aren't 100% of identity and the motivations of its inventor?
Along with that, Newton owns the three laws of motion and his control of newtonian physics as it pertains to celestial movement is still unknown.
Truly. Sarcasm aside, if calculus is ever to be used in serious architectural, civil engineering, electrical engineering and aerospace, these questions need to be answered before we move off the legacy rule of thumb system.

Also, if you are sending from coinbase, I don't believe you can request a lower fee or set a manual fee. The wallet that you send *to* won't change that.
The ceo of coinbase (Brian Armstrong) said that segwit (enabling massive fee reductions) has not been a feature requested from users and isn't even on their top five priorities. Id be pissed if I was one of their users anymore.

No. It's up there but on a percentage basis 9% premium is high but still seems about right. I've seen us diverge between 3-10% in excess of the USD spot price, and this rises during big upwards movements as well.

Either they sent it or they didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:21:18
So, if his wallet is artificially restricting it (and I've heard blockchain info is shit so that wouldn't surprise me), then yes maybe? That's wallet specific and nothing to do with Bitcoin though
But he can import his seed into a real wallet like Samourai or electrum, and sign a super low transaction fee for his 7000+ satoshis. There's nothing on the protocol level blocking a tx like that from propagating until sub 1000 SATs I believe.

@_date: 2017-12-03 09:40:17
Every transaction on bitcoin is instant (or approximately 2-5 seconds for mempool propagation across nodes in reality).
Fees relate to confirmation time, not transaction time (2-5sec). Nobody sets the fee except the user. Some people use shitty wallets that auto set fees for them and do a bloody craptastic job (blockchain.info etc).
Sure my 5 cent fee transcations took a day or two to confirm - but you don't need a confirmation for selling things that only cost a few bucks. You certainly don't need it (to accept) a 25 cent lemonade payment.
People selling coffee or a meal at a restaurant don't need to keep the customer around for 10 minutes to an hour waiting for a confirmation. That is retarded. Selling a house? A car? Sure - get them to put a hefty fee on and don't hand it over until you get a confirmation or two. So to answer your question how can btc be used as a day to day currency (1) its not suited for it, but (2) still quite easily by realising 0 conf is fine for small shit

If it's only sending to a public address, there's no danger.
Once you've spent from that address at least once you've revealed your public key, which could theoretically provide an attack point for a quantum computer in the future to brute force your private key, if you still have money on that address.
Address is not a public key. Address is derived from a public key which is revealed on a spending event from that address
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:22:01
But if your hardware wallet can only make a one way transaction that only goes to a paper address wallet, why would you even have a hardware wallet? You couldn't use it to send coins to an exchange or any of the useful things hardware wallets can do
Edit: if you had a white list that was a few address, ie, exchange addresses, your phone's hot wallet, your paper wallet then okay yeah. I could see that as being useful.
Easy to implement on the wallet side. Without being a Dev, I assume you could soft fork it in at the protocol level if you got enough support and made it opt in.

Acknowledging they hold billions, you could reasonably expect Coinbase to move conservatively and cautiously.

Because the value of Bitcoin would drop to near zero. That's probably why.
If there is no blocksize limit, there is no fee market to use valuable blockspace. With 1 bitcoin I can create 100,000,000 outputs (1 Satoshi per utxo) per block for zero fees, increasing the size of the blockchain by 22gb every ten minutes or 3tb a day.
Within a week, Bitcoin is reduced to half a dozen data centres for mining and full nodes. Now nobody can view and verify the blockchain. With this power I can blacklist addressess and hard fork the 21m coin cap limit. 
Value plummets to zero.

The more you can put up, the more liquidity you will have in channels bi directionally and less the amount of times you will have to close a channel if it gets emptied in one direction. But I mean it's possible going back and forth to might never need to *have* to close it.

I actually owned a fair bit of eth until last week (finally sold as it approached last ATH) which I bought at the start of the year. I was originally admittedly impressed with it, but grew more disillusioned the more I followed vitalik on Twitter and disagreed with his ideas. Also don't like the kumbaya eth community. I actually love how the Bitcoin community at war with itself. We're like Spartans, killing the weak among us and constantly being attacked and getting stronger.
Ethereum wants to do weird esoteric decentralised applications that nobody will actually use but everyone cheers because they want to get rich (not saying that's bad). As for smart contacts, even their founder can't code a basic multi Sig contact without fucking it up - multiple times. Solidity is fucked.

You cant process individual transactions, only blocks of transactions. If you have a single Antminer S9 it would take you about a decade to find a block solo mining assuming hashrate didnt go up as well.
And if you only processed your own transcations in a block that can fit thousands, you would really fuck it for everyone else. Hence the 'chaos' part if everyone did that lol

Hey man, I get it. You probably saw ripple mooning earlier this year, bought a few bags just before it dumped and now you want to shill up how great it is with low fees.
I can understand that. If it was a crypto like eth or LTC, that's even forgivable. I've shilled pivx myself a lifetime ago before I dumped it for Bitcoin.
But it isn't eth or LTC or pivx. It's a test prototype for big banks to leverage off satoshis genius so they can save money, all while jamming in horrendous on-chain aml/kyc requirements.  When we inevitably move to a cash less society, having to rely on a system like ripple is absolutely terrifying in the most Orwellian sense of the word.
Do you think people want 0.0003 fees? No. They can get free instant transfers with visa or PayPal. Then why or how is Bitcoin smashing a $167 bill MC compared to ripples single digit billion dollar market cap? Oh, it's because people fucking hate banks stealing or seizing their money, they fucking hate censorship, and it turns out people like some degree of anonymity.

Yes but that has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it's a private agreement between you and a third party company. 
Perhaps for you wanting to cash out you would sell OTC to Coinbase for 2%. I wouldn't (have sold $3x,xxx.xx worth in the past).
You can easily sell for 0% by finding a person to directly buy your Bitcoin from you. Or you could set a market order with a 0% commission, etc.. much better ways

It's called a speculative attack on fiat and it is the BEST way to kill current financial institutions, by borrowing credit and using debt to strengthen unseizable uncontrollable crypto. 
I borrowed $25,000 to invest. My partner put $10,000 on credit too. AMA.
Edit: We paid back the debt after bitcoin did 1,500% and could buy a house in cash now if we wanted to with the remainder.
We were never in any trouble paying back the loan if Bitcoin crashed to 0. 
Additionally We cashed out the principal so Bitcoin could fall 99% and we'd still be in profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:40:24
Yes there is a big difference. Selling fees don't exist in Bitcoin. They aren't part of the protocol and are arbitrarily charged within the business. Your coins are not interacting with the blockchain in anyway. This fee goes to Coinbase. They are based on fiat percentage of value.
Transfer fees occur in events that affect the Blockchain and the utxo set. While coinbase can 'force' you to set a transfer fee, they are in truth optional and can/should be manually set by the user. These fees go to the miner of the transaction. They are based in transaction size in data.

How deep do you want to go, exactly?
Keep in mind these are not human solvable puzzles (unless you are Peter Wuille). They are specialised chips bruteforcing trillions of times a second to find an answer to an equation variable, essentially.
Whoever finds the answer to the next block is recognised by the network and allocated the finders reward (currently 12.5 btc) to an address of their choosing. 
The function serves no external purpose except to prove the amount of work and energy sacrificed into finding the solution for that block. This is called proof of work, it solves a long standing network problem called the Byzantium generals problem and helps secure the network against malicious attacks (an attacker would have to put in work greater than 51% of everyone else).

Anyone who tells you that you don't need to run a full node is either a scammer trying to degrade your monetary self sovereignty or a useful idiot duped by the former.
Every user should run a node. This should be as cheap as possible. 
You can run a pruned node on a smartphone now. How fucking cool is that? 
You can get blocks from space on a $100 dish that are impossible for governments to block. Uhh fuck yeah!
Of course there are problems scaling with modern technology - because we'll need an order of magnitude, probably 2 orders, above 1gb blocks to scale to the planet where every coffee transaction is recorded for eternity.
Understand the moment crypto centralises to big database nodes, is the moment govts can apply pressure to fork in whatever black lists or removal of confidential transactions they want. Nobody is interested in free cheap fast payments if that's the cost. And yes, that's the cost for 1gb blocks

@_date: 2017-12-04 13:07:32
Okay jesus. How to start.
A hash function is where you can take a number or any amount of data, and convert it into a fixed string (64 characters long)
You can see how sha256 hashses (bitcoins chosen) work here
Type in anything you want and see how it changes the hash result. You can hash a text file, a video, an mp3, or a bitcoin block of transcations
Basically, a miner will draft a block. This has to include a minimum of the hash from the last block (linking it in the chain), a header (the current block number and other data), the miners reward address, and most importantly the Nonce, which is a random number and the actual 'thing' they are mining for.
They can also optionally choose up to 1mb worth of unconfirmed transactions that have not been added to the blockchain. The optional user-attached fees from these transactions will also go to the miner, so they pick the ones with the biggest fees first.
Now, bitcoin has a difficult adjustment algorithm that says "every hash result you get from your block must start with a specific amount of zeros"
The miner will keep the block header, transactions, everything else the same and keep changing the nonce to random values to see which nonce ends up with a resulting block hash that begins with a '0' and not any other character.
To keep blocks around 10 minutes of average, the amount of 0's fluctuates depending on how many people are mining. More 0's means you will have to try more random Nonces to find a hash solution with the correct number of zeros.
Whoever finds a nonce that results in the next block will immediately race to publish their block. This will include the hash of the last block, the header, their reward address, any transactions they include, and most importantly, the random nonce that when combined with the previous information and hashed, will give a block hash of 0000000000sefk345ujhs234df234kba (for example - only important part is the requiste number of leading zeros).
Every node will immediately attempt to replicate it. Once the nonce is found, its trivial to double check that it works.
100 blocks after that miners block has been added, the network recognises it as secure and the miner can spend their reward.

Give it to a trusted family member in another state. Tell them what it is and let them hide it. Use a passphrase you'll remember in ten years so that the seed alone won't risk any funds being lost.

Nothing wrong with mining altcoins, they can potentially be more profitable than bitcoin mining which is very competitive.
Nicehash pays you in Bitcoin for mining altcoins for them and their customers. But it's not mining bitcoin, and requires different capabilities and planning to mining Bitcoin.

The amount of attempts at finding the random nonce are huge.
Back of the napkin estimates I think about 
7,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 nonces are attempted before finding a block on average by the entire network today. This happens every ten minutes-ish..
To answer your original question, imagine miners are bruteforcing a value to solve a puzzle that dynamically get harder or easier based on how quickly the last few thousand puzzles were solved. First one to randomly guess it gets double checked by everyone else, and are also granted both 12.5 bitcoins for their work by everyone else, and the fees from whatever transactions they decide to include in the data that they hashed.

ok look; I own an apology, I understood breadwallet to function 99% of other API-based light wallets; copay, b.info, samourai, trezor &amp; ledger clients all query company backend servers. Plenty of vulnerabilities in this as when ledger servers went down recently and people were unable to access or verify funds, and samourai servers had DOS issues in the last fortnight when they couldnt keep up with demand.
Seems BW connects to random bitcoin nodes to query, which is rare and good. It's still not as safe as running your own node and querying that (which breadwallet has the option to do), but a lot of my points are negated by it using SPV and not API.

It's a self regulating system where miners are incentivized to maximise efficiency; the blockchain doesn't *need* twh of energy at all, it could run fine on a single desktop computer.

Based on the fact anyone running a full node, which is currently possible on a raspberry pi 3, and a modest amount of btc to put up, is able to open up enough channels to become an lnd routing node. Minimal energy running cost. Minimal capital investment. No permission required.

I did 6cent txs last weekend that confirmed within 24 hours. You haven't told me what wallet you're using? The bad ones usually force fees onto you.
BitPay, Coinbase and Blockchain.info are the three big businesses who were behind the segwit2x attack last month.
They claimed it was because users were complaining of high fees, however they've all refused to implement the actual segwit part of segwit2x with 75% signature fee size reduction because 'it's not a priority for our customers'. If you use any of those businesses and fees are an issue for you, I wouldn't give them my business.

Misread about your friend.
Lightning has multiple client implementations but only one compatible protocol; the lightning protocol. Although it's still under development (though in feature freeze for 1.0) there aren't multiple versions. It's a standardised and codified later 2 network that will run not only on top of Bitcoin mainnet but any blockchain that meets certain compatibility functions like a CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY scripts
Transactions are near instant because all they are is a swapping of two multisig 2of2 transactions without broadcasting them. You don't need to broadcast them until you want to close your channel and settle on main chain which you might only do once a year. Bitcoin block time is irrelevant in this case.

Please keep in context when reading these points that Brian and his exchange Coinbase built their wealth and empire from bitcoin. So how does he repay bitcoin?
* Openly championed every contentious attacking fork vector including bitcoin classic, bitcoin unlimited, bitcoin XT and segwit2X.
* Called bitcoin core developers 'the greatest threat to bitcoin'
* Is bullish on ethereum and publicly chose to focus on **cryptokitties** instead of lightning development
* Under his development Coinbase ran a super shitty bitcoin backend that didn't UTXO consolidate, batch transactions or implement segwit; costing his customers and the wider bitcoin community millions in unnecessary fees and network congestion
* Front ran the bcash listing then cleared himself of all wrong-doing

These people are responsible for keeping critical industries protected and hardened against threat actors who might have quantum computing. They were very critical of academic researchers claiming that classical encryption would be broken in 5-10 years, because they felt it was an deceptive way to obtain more funding and grants (lol)
Pretty much every post quantum scheme seemed to have some drawback, and this was compounded for blockchain uses because the strongest schemes were usually intensive to validate or needed massive 100kb-1500kb keys.
The amount of qubits to break something like ecdsa (they believed it would take 4000 logical qubits which requires an order of magnitude more physical qubits) is so far off that at this point it was purely theoretical to them if it was even possible.
On the bright side, SHA only gets a linear performance efficiency increase using Shors, so they claimed a simple increase to SHA512 would yield the same protection as SHA256 in a post quantum world.

I went to a post quantum encryption seminar only last week. Speaker wasnt concerned about elliptic curve being broken before 2030 and neither am I.
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:24:56
Not quite. Shaw's algorithm is a quantum specific factorisation algorithm that has been around for 25 years and is what would be used to break elliptic curve cryptography, given enough qubits. We understand pretty well how it would actually work and has been used in experimental quantum computers to factorise small numbers for decades now.
I agree with your second point - there's no clear alternative just yet. But there will be, once Q computers become real enough to spur more research.

It was a closed seminar not open to the public. I can't reveal names however it was run by people with PHDs in computing, encryption and quantum mechanics. If you want to view this sceptically then that's fine.
They went into detail regarding several different post quantum/shor-grover hard replacements like code and lattice based cryptography, but nothing looked like a particularly easy drop in for ecdsa, especially with the need to keep keys small and validation quick and resource light.
So even if the threat is higher than they think, there's nothing ready we can drop in right now anyway.

Ok so.. each block has a number of where it lies in the blockchain, we are currently just under half a million blocks since the genesis block 
Each range of block numbers has a set max reward someone who mines that block can claim which was established at the beginning of the protocol.
The higher the block number, the smaller the reward is, halving every 210,000 blocks. Eventually when you mine block 6,011,033,999 the reward you can claim will be zero according to that table. The reward then will be entirely based off collecting transaction fees, which is recycling, not adding new btc.

Its not decentralised if its a permissioned blockchain that (somehow) allows pgp rollbacks. Who are you going to get to mine the chain? Who is going to stop fraudulent chargebacks - you would need a centralised network controller to mediate that. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:27:46
From the emission protcol. You mine a block, and if its valid, everyone agrees that you mined that block and you get the reward.
The maximum reward you can claim is determined by the block height, which is roughly appended to how long bitcoin has existed. In the current range just under half a million blocks, the reward  (which as determined when bitcoin started and agreed to by all parties) is 12.5btc.
Every 4 years or 210,000 blocks, the amount of the reward you can claim and be accepted by the network is reduced by half. Eventually around 2140 this will hit 0.000 bitcoins per block reward.

"So am I correct in saying that my public key / bitcoin address on an exchange has the same functionality as a public key / address on a wallet in that anyone and everyone can send coin to it and I can send coin from it? Just that I am in control and 'own' the bitcoins in a wallet as opposed to being at the mercy of the exchange?"
Yes and no. Exchanges have huge 100+ shared bitcoin accounts on the blockchain that they pay out of when you want to withdraw. They keep the balances of their customers synthetically seperate on an internal database.
However, they will assign you addresses just for you that you or other people can deposit to.
"In a wallet, thinking of going with a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger, I can create as many accounts as I want, hence as many addresses as I want? Sending bitcoin to / from any of them? Opening and closing new ones as I please? Also I can have both segwit and non-segwit accounts in said wallet?"
Yes. If you get a trezor, it will be split into bitcoin accounts, and legacy accounts. You can have as many sub-accounts, and as many addresses in those sub accounts as you want. 
"When sending from an exchange address to a wallet address or between wallet accounts/addresses, am I charged blockchain fees everytime? Or can the moving between my wallet accounts be done off-chain?"
Yes to fees everytime. Offchain, fee-free movements are only in between internal exchange wallets.

When I say legacy bitcoin, this is trezors term, and refers to generating addresses using the older P2PHK addresses. Segwist replaces this with P2SH addresses. 
I believe ledger does something similar. They are totally interchangeable and compatible with eachother unlike bitcoin and bitcoin cash for example.
Honestly, the best thing to explain accounts and addresses is just to get in there and poke around and see how it works. I would highly recommended reading this to understand how it works on the unseen backend. Its okay if you don't understand it - totally uneeded for day to day use

Segwit is an upgraded way of compiling a bitcoin transaction. it's backwards compatible, and it works with current generation Trezors anyway.
To be honest - if you don't understand it you will notice no difference on the front end anyway. Long story short; feel free to buy a trezor now if you need a wallet.

 You use your wallet to sign an address never before sent from.  Everyone sees the public key, the transaction value,  and the signature. If a quantum computer can bruteforce the remainding variable (private key) before the transaction is made immutable,  it can rebroadcast a transaction from your address to anther recipient (itself).
If you just had an unspent address, I don't believe you could brute force the private key from that - you'd need at least one transaction being sent from it.  This is why change addresses are used and its not recommended to reuse addresses. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:01:58
okay sent. 
You can see the input from my address. The 0.00030599btc (1usd) is going to you, and the remainder of the my bitcoin UTXO (unspent transaction outspent) is being sent by my wallet to another address I control call a change address.
the transaction is now in the mempool which means the whole network is aware of it and hasnt rejected. but its not mined into a block yet which makes it immutable.
Now to get that transaction it into the next block (10 minutes) the current recommended fee was 84c on top of the $1. I chose a low (8c) fee so it might take a few hours for you to see the confirmations going up. once it gets one confirmation, its in the blockchain proper and should get an additional confirmation number every 10 minutes or new block.

Something like 80% of bitcoin core full nodes are estimated to not have the bandwidth to relay 8MB blocks to dozens of peers every 10 minutes, which means they would be unable to participate in the network. It's already hundreds of GB a month in download and upload quota to run a full node, which is healthy for the network but is un-incentivized (I used to run a full node but it ended up eating too many resources - not hard drive space or cpu power, but simple congestion on my home network).
The bitcoin network would be left with 20% of the current node amounts.. which would probably be fine for relaying blocks, but most of those nodes are the ones being run by exchanges, wallet providors and mining pools. These present dangerously centralised points of weakness for malignant actors like governments.
For reference, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin Cash nodes are artificially spun up Amazon web service cloud nodes paid for by people who want to see it succeed at the cost of a lot of money coming out of someones pocket. Don't know about you, but that sounds pretty centralized to me.

I bought a nuc because the form factor, portability and power efficiency were the only way I could host a node. So yes, I do need an SSD, and an m2 at that. 
Limiting upload rate is fine. Maybe I don't need to serve a terabyte a month. However on any ADSL connection I've had since my current once, running a full node fucking killed my internet for anything else. No Netflix, buffering YouTube.. etc
Maybe it's different in America or wherever you're from. But nodes should be run all around the world for decentralizing, including my country

If you don't have a million for infrastructure (cooling, 3phase power, racks), direct supply contracts with your local power plants and decent tech support on your team its probably not worth it.
And yes I've mined with both multi GPU rigs and ASICs before.
If you want to do it as a hobby that maybe makes a little on the side and not a serious income though, that's different. Just Chuck nicehash on a decent GPU and you're set. Keep in mind you won't be mining Bitcoin, although you'll be paid in bitcoin

In Australia, I'd recommend coinjar for your first few buys and eventually move to either a p2p exchange like localbitcoins, or a trading exchange like btcmarkets, don't buy on coinbase as it has high fees (5%) and you can't sell.

There is no fee for receiving on the Bitcoin network. Some exchanges charge a Rx fee but that's arbitrary and pretty outrageous.
Fees have nothing to do with the amount of value being sent. It's based on how at-capacity the network is, and how quickly you want it confirmed. You could send a million dollars for 5 cents if you didn't mind waiting a day.

All of them. 
It's a current gen i3 NUC with 8gb of ddr4 ram and a fast 500gb M.2 solid state.
Hard drive will fill up (already nearing 40% with only OS and block chain right now).
Apparently 8gb of ram will be insufficient for processing 8mb blocks (didn't expect that but hey - I suppose it needs to keep the 2.3gb utxo set in there too maybe)
And bandwidth, I'm very lucky where I am that I can spend over $100 a month on a 100/40 line with unmetered uplink - but next year I will probably have to move to a slower, metered internet connection (think single digit Mbps) as I move properties.

I think we disagree on how things should be valued. I mean yeah you can argue jewellery and electronics and I can argue P2P value transfer but both gold and Bitcoin have no intrinsic value (hate that term).
They are only worth exactly what people are willing to pay for them - they can't be over or under valued.

And I'm aruging that both bitcoin and gold are worth only whatever we as a society collectively hallucinate they are worth.
And since I've witnessed a definite age disparity (subjective), with older people valuing gold more and younger people valuing bitcoin more, I think you can make a case that demographics will GREATLY swing society to one that values bitcoin more than gold, as younger gens come into prime and the boomers shuffle off.

@_date: 2017-11-27 04:32:37
If you had an entire world economy that was based on bitcoin, and the inflation rate was approaching zero (current inflation is actually like 4% until the next halvening) then yes, the economy would move and grow slower (another word to use would be more sustainable).
What will probably happen if bitcoin become a dominant world reserve currency, is that central banks will create and distribute fiat that is 'backed' by an underlying crypto asset ($10,000 gets you one millibit from the fed reserve, etc). 
Of course this *can* keep getting diluted through fractional reserve so banks will be able to keep loaning out more crypto fiat, problem solved

Your idea of gold as money is taking it to a dealer and exchanging it for dollars and using those?
That's hilarious man. Like I said, last month I bought dumplings from a food truck with Bitcoin. No conversion to fiat at all, seller kept the Bitcoin.
Only yesterday I cashed out $9,110 worth of ethereum to buy a car. I signed up to the exchange online Wednesday night (Independent Reserve), transferred and sold my ethereum Thursday morning and had the fiat on my bank account at 6pm that same night. Without leaving my house. I don't know what you're rambling on about coin dealers.

6) Portable
7) Durable

As I understand, if we ever even hard fork, it'll be at least with a lead up time of 1-2+ years, baked into several version release clients prior. And it won't be a size only hard fork, it'll have to improve a host of things including signatures, block headers/format, maybe signing algo etc.
Way better to scale with sidechains and layer2 until then.

It's not scaling, it's a capacity increase that requires a hardfork.

Derivation seed path. Imagine it as the route your wallet takes to transform those words into numbers. 
Every crypto has its own path so that you can use the same seed across different currencies.
Bitcoin has two standardised parts, 39 for legacy and 49 for segwit, but it's possible the wallet you made it on employed a custom deviation path for whatever reason. Youd have to try and find it.
Derivation paths are safe to share/post.

If you own a paper certificate issued by a bank, you do not own bitcoin. If you can't point to an address on the blockchain that you have the private key for, you do not own bitcoin.

Hardware wallets securely and offline generate a 12-24 universal recovery seed that is all you need to regenerate your private keys and addresses.
If you write down this seed on something like a copper card or a commercial product like a cryptosteel, it doesn't matter if your hardware wallet is destroyed or corrupted or EMPd, you can always recover it.

You would have to scale down over time. Difficulty doesn't readjust in the way you're thinking with the other forks EDA. But essentially correct.

Incorrect, he said Bitcoin would be trading under $10 a share.
1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 shares.
So a Satoshi is still under $10. Get them while they're cheap!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:48:54
I'm not trying to insult you. This just really blew me away.
The value of Bitcoin isn't just in its dollar value. It's in the fact that nobody can take it from you, seize it, confiscate it, or stop you from spending it. It's literally the first time in human history that this has been accomplished (why do you actually think the price keeps going up?). You lose that incredible value with a bank certificate and only get the fiat value and a lot of counterparty risk.
Why wouldn't you want to own the real thing so that you don't have to trust your bank (a third party) will hopefully honour it in the distant future? No fucking way would I take that risky chance.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:55:22

Lol. Sure. Just wait for the dip from $12,000 to $8,200 - never buy at an ATH! Make sure you save every cent on fees hunting around for the best deal while btc gets hundreds of dollars more expensive every day.
Also why waste $100 on a hardware wallet when you can get perfectly good security for free using a complicated system of airgapped live-usb computers?
Get real. This market has rekt people who wet their panties fussing over tiny fees when overlooking the historically unprecedented gains.
Buy as much as you can, when you can, as quickly as you can, and don't skimp on security.

Doubtful. I think they would fill up pretty quickly as new industries and companies found a way to use this free space.
What we could do is a hard fork to 8 or even 32mb, with block Heights restricting it to 2, 4, 8mb etc. So a gradual phase in that way

1 developer who unilaterally decided on his own new DAA against community consensus. Emission rate either 40 blocks an hour or 1 Block every hour. Fees still as high as Bitcoin in some instances. Avg blocksize about 80kb because there is no actual users sending txs. Abysmal node count, unsteady hashrate, continued use of sha256 algo puts it at a massive security risk in terms of double spend/wipeout attacks from Bitcoin miners. No malleability fix limits any layer 2 extensions like lightning network. No scaling roadmap beyond making blocks bigger to 32mb. Already about to do a contentious hard fork within 3 months of existance.
It is literally the shittiest coin in the top 100 by market cap.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:27:28
The reason we call it a hard fork is because once its happens, they are permanently divergent. It's like how humans and monkeys once shared a common ancestor, but at one point the legacy genome shifted by a certain point that interbreeding became impossible.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:28:12

That's less than a thousandth of my stash and I only move it a couple of times a year. Genuinely sorry if your use case is bumped out, but at 1000% increase this year it looks like coffee payments and micro transactions are not what's driving the price growth as much as people like Ver might want to think.
I have a ton of cheap instant payment methods a lot more user friendly than Bitcoin... what I don't have is uncensorable unconfiscatable wealth (apart from btc).

Flash memory in USB drives are susceptible to bit rot, especially if left unpowered, and can (unrecoverably) corrupt after only 5-10 years. If you have the seed on paper, thats what you protect. Laminated/cardboard is even better, copper or steel is the best.
"Solid-state media, such as EPROMs, flash memory and other solid-state drives, store data using electrical charges, which can slowly leak away due to imperfect insulation. The chip itself is not affected by this, so reprogramming it once per decade or so will prevent data decay. The biggest problem can be finding a clean copy of the master data from which the chip may be reprogrammed; frequently, by the time the user discovers the data decay, the master data may be lost"

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:28:08
Yes. Whoops. Lol.
At this stage in its evolution, Bitcoins primary use case is digital gold, not a hard-to-use PayPal. Keep in mind its not your wallet charging you that, it's your wallet estimating the fees to make your transaction look attractive to be mined in a very competitive network. You can pay as much (or as little) as you want, depending on your wallet.
Conversely, I moved two amounts of money on Bitcoin yesterday that were over $10,000 and $72,000 respectively for about a dollar in fees.
If you want to move micro transactions you can either look at alt coins, or wait for bitcoins layer two solutions to roll out.

You don't own your Bitcoins with a coinbase account. You're at their mercy and they can confiscate your Bitcoins at any time for anything they consider a beach of their ToS.
 Recovery seed you do, its permissionless, wallet agnostic, uncensorable.

Segwit is the compromise. 
Core doesn't have 'a leader'. It's an open source developer community FFS.
If miners continue their tirade of blocking segwit forever, thats fine by me.
Users who require quick/cheap txs will go to different coins and bitcoin price will stagnate. The *only* people who lose in this scenario are the miners refusing to signal who are tied to their ASIC investments. The average user will either use alts, or use bitcoin as a stable safe-asset that doesn't require SW/scaling.

Miners do not control or propagate the blockchain friend, and computing power is not voting power.
This is the fallacy that big blockers have fallen into.
A group of validating full nodes achieve economic and technical consensus between themselves. They then employ contractors in the form of sha256 hashers to order transactions for them. That's how it works, as proven by UASF and NO2X.
To answer your question with historical examples, miners have indeed attempted in the past to change the protocol to reward themselves more. During the first halving, some miners attempted to pay themselves at the original reward. They were fired by the consensus network and paid an economic cost for not doing their job.

Heh ok. I'm a ten year military vet and grew up libertarian - but I also feel that societies have a duty of care to provide basic care and quality of life to citizens now that we have robots building robots and 3D printers that can construct burgers from petri dish proteins.
Modern society is such a big complex intertwined thing that the days of being able to go it alone as a rugged individual are gone, and I think some people are really fighting that. A lot of us Bitcoiners especially, I'm guilty sometimes too.
Against fully free markets/unregulated capitalism as they've proven time again that it eventually winds its way to evil outcomes, whether it's lead in the water supply or super flammable cladding on an apartment complex, businesses have taught me they can't be trusted to self regulate. 
On the other hand, I'm admittedly wary of big government oversight despite also working for big government. They haven't proven much better than unfettered free market forces especially when it comes to long term planning beyond election season; going all in on Bitcoin years ago was a way for me to help mitigate against their power as an individual. It gives me a way to move and live outside their system if I need to, but I see it as a personal trump card or life jacket.

Which is magnitudes of order easier to brute force after exfiltration assuming you've chosen a password with 10-12 characters. Just because that encrypted server is now one place that your data is at rest doesn't mean it doesn't exist in other places, or was copied in transit (chance of this approaches 100%)
Once it hits the internet you must assume it is compromised - Ive worked with extremely sensitive data files for nearly a decade and anything not airgapped is immediately considered unsecure.
Have you also considered the fact that decrypting it will leave also leave your unencrypted seed open to a wide range of spectre style attacks?

..da fuck?
Are you talking about the nonce value..?
Edit: I just read their explanation.
"The good news: No advanced math or computation is involved. You may have heard that miners are solving difficult mathematical problems--that's not true at all. What they're actually doing is trying to be the first miner to come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number (a "hash")  that is less than or equal to the target hash. It's basically guess work."
Yeah that's an incorrect explanation. You need to find the magic nonce (random number) which when combined with the 1mb block and run through the sha256 hash function, will give a hashed result with a certain number of zeros at the beginning.
Reading about hash functions in a general sense will make this more understandable

It's fine, just means you can't serve historical blocks to people starting nodes, and you don't want to go offline for more than 3 days or you'll have to redownload the entire chain. But if that is what you need to run a node, its def better than not.

"Do you think that the fact that you can send BTC and other cryptos effectively into a void space where you lose them and nobody receives them if you use the wrong address or get a digit wrong holds back bitcoin and other crypto currencies and can anything be done to change this? Could a manipulator who wants to see bitcoin’s demise deliberately “lose” large quantities of Bitcoin for example in order to eventually destroy it (this may be expensive and price would likely spike due to diminishing supply but theoretically possible I suppose)."
This wouldn't hurt bitcoin at all.
"With computer power and knowledge increasing all the time, and the stakes and value of bitcoin ever higher, and bitcoin and using an underlying public blockchain, what is the possibility that bitcoin can be hacked/tampered with/mutable?"
Possibility approaches zero, even if SHA256 was broken it would be extremely obvious if historical blocks were tampered with and re-propagated.

It was a gamble,  but I did my research, developed faith in bitcoin and accepted the risks. I started buying below $1,000 and kept buying up to around $2,500. My debt at the start of the year was about -$50,000 that I could just never to pay off, and my net worth is about the same as that today. 
I borrowed money to buy bitcoins from my girlfriend,  0% credit cards, my job... anywhere I could. I also held through some big dips until I was ready to start paying back. 
 No longer buying with borrowed money (or any money) and I've certainly sold some, but I'm still a hodler. The rest of my coins aren't leaving my hands until they can fund my early retirement...

Miners can make a chain as long as they want.  If any part of it doesn't follow perfect consensus rules,  the chain simply does not exist to the nodes running the network and relaying blocks, transactions, spv client queries and historical bock data. 
Doesn't matter if you have 1%,  51% or 99% of the hashpower... you obey the nodes consensus demands if you want your blocks to propagate and be recognised.

Turns out the societies who take care of their citizens are objectively financially better off than those who don't. And Australia has the 21st highest immigration rate in the world (US is 29) so your claim people are leaving in droves is once again, objectively, a lie.

So, every other crypto barring the 3 DAG coins (Gbyte, IOTA, Nano) use a blockchain just like bitcoin. 98% of them are uninteresting garbage. I would argue Monero is the only other interesting crypto, and that's because it uses privacy-by-default CT &amp; ring signatures.
Therefore, it's not the blockchain part of Bitcoin that makes Bitcoin amazing.
Bitcoin is so much more than it's block chain (which only solves the double spending problem, a great breakthrough but pretty useless in isolation for almost every application that doesn't use a native token to reward PoW).

Those hundred millions of fiat from VC investing aren't a gift. (some of it) Is there to supply that liquidity for fiat withdrawal you mentioned before should a ton of people choose to make crypto bank runs at the same time.
"All you did was give them some fiat and sit on your butt."
Hahahah well fuck that is some arrogance. Read how OTC exchanges usually make money.
I have used several OTC exchanges to withdraw fiat, and I have never been charged a single dollar for a fiat withdrawal to a bank. That's because they make their profit on this thing called the Spread. You should come across it in your research.
This is no different than being charged to withdraw money from your banks ATM. If they charge you a fee to access your own money they are either (1) alarmingly incompetent at their core business and desperate for any income stream they can get, or (2) maliciously charging for everything they can and you should find a different bank

Just look at the address you gave him on a block explorer. Either it will have an unconfirmed incoming transaction (with a txid) or he didnt send it. Regardless of blocktimes it should tame a max of about 10 seconds to propagate to nearly all nodes.
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:03:58
By 'screwing the system ' I am assuming you mean creating a block that invalidates rules,  ie; a 10mb block or a too high block reward. Nodes will simply drop that block and ban whoever continues to broadcast it. How many blocks are built on top of it are totally irrelevant.  Hence the keyword "valid" longest chain which you ommitted.

The network effect gives Bitcoin value. The more people who own it and believe that other people will want it, the more valuable it becomes. You can't duplicate the network effect with an altcoin or even a hard fork.
You claim you have 'expectations' as if you were daring us to disprove them, but you can disprove your own theories merely by looking at the historical data of crypto and altcoins from 2011-2017. 
Of all the altcoins from 2011-2014, only ethereum and litecoin have survived in any real form. In 2017-2020, most of all the shitcoins, scamcoins and ICOs you see now will have died off. Only Bitcoin remains... because it has the network effect. 
Do some of those altcoins have great features? Yes, undoubtedly. Some of those have been or will be merged into bitcoin, either on chain or off. You are thinking of cryptos as technologies were people are obsessed with upgrading to the latest newest shiniest tech every year. Incorrect. Think of it like an element. Like gold. Psudeo immutable and potentially eternal.

When your key is generated on an online computer, it is unsecured. 
After encryption, your key is unsecured everytime you decrypt it to sign a transaction.
A hardware wallet is a physically isolated environment for the generation and use of keys. The only thing that gets in is who you want to pay and how much, the only thing that gets out is signed transactions. 
You can safely plug a hardware wallet into a pc that is infested with malware, and as long as you doublecheck the address youre sending to matches your hardware wallet screen, its safe.


every hardware wallet generates an english-word seed the first time you initialise it. you write down the seed seperately offline and you can restore your key and all the transaction history related to it on any other hardware wallet or even compatible software wallets.

My seeds backups are stored in plaintext, physically on stamped metal cards in a secured location. They have never been stored digitally on a computer or exposed to the internet.
Storing it in a digital encrypted file has multiple weak points;
A) Encrypted file is compromised and later bruteforced, fund stolen.
B) Encrypted file is compromised, password is compromised and funds stolen.
C) Encrypted file is hot-compromised at moment of decryption and funds stolen.
D) Encrypted file and backups are corrupted after several years, funds pemanently lost (you can mitigate this by storing encrypted file in the cloud which increases chance of A).
E) Encryption passphrase is forgotten after several years and funds permanently lost (this is the most common and probable way you will fuck it up - you can mitigate it by storing your password in cloud/multiple places which also increases B).
Conversely, my way is reliant on physical security. It's not impenetrable - nothing is - but an attacker would have to overtly breach several physical layers, and no-one except my wife even knows the location where our seeds are stored. I could add a passphrase to them, which is something I'm considering, but I have to weigh that against the risk of locking myself (or my wife) out if I can't remember it in a decade from now.
There are many, many stories of people who have done exactly what you are and have lost their funds to accident, digital degradation or malicious attack. Its those stories that made me take this shit seriously and actually put some effort in, especially now that my bitcoin is worth a lot more than it did when I got it..

I run a full node (core 0.15)  ranked in the top 15-20% of nodes, but my trezor is not connected to it.  This is because trezor requires a bitcore server,  which is released by bitpay, the archetype of evil. Does anyone know the best way around this? Could I use my core node to at least verify the balances of trezor generated public addresses for receiving?

Ah I see. So when you say 'wallet' you are specifically referring to exchange wallet? I don't see it happening (user control - they don't want to be on the hook for customer complaints).

We took Canis Lupis in the depths of our prehistory and elevated them to become the first and premier client race of mankind.

If you're part of a social collective that continually abuses our end of that pact; you're letting down homo sapiens everywhere and you NEED to be censured by the rest of us.

@_date: 2017-10-14 22:13:46
Ok so your risk with $300 of Bitcoin is not $5000, it is $300.
And the chain length (number of blocks) has essentially no interaction with market capital even though they appear loosely correlated
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:42:30
No. Think of it as a secure offline computer for generating private keys and signing transactions safely (it has its own ARM cpu etc). If you can build or get access to a computer that will never touch the internet,  the same security can be achieved,  however for $100 the trezor is very convenient and simple. It is still susceptible to bitrot and corruption like any device - that's why the seed backup you get from it must be stored as physically indestructibly as you can.

@_date: 2017-10-14 21:26:07


This is retarded. I mean, what Satoshi said is absolutely true, but it refers to chain splits and the possibility of a fragmented/partitioned network coming back together under the agreed consensus rules. If China got firewalled off and China and the rest of the world worked on the bitcoin chain seperate, when the Chinese govt opens up bitcoin traffic a week later, the nodal network will compare chains and decide on the longest one to move forward on.
What it does NOT mean, and the implication you're making, is that any that any coin with more proof of work automatically becomes bitcoin. A chain with malformed blocks is not factored into a nodes decision making process when evaluating which chain is the longest.

It would take about 1000 blocks to the next difficulty, maybe 2 months of blocks every 90 minutes and then readjust. We'll be fine. If they got 90% hashrate, I doubt they could keep it for more than 36 hours

If you've held the Bitcoin for over a year, halve the amount of your profit and add that amount to your to reported income at tax time. If you earnt $80k - $180k you're paying 37%, marginal tax rates, so effectively (37% / 2) = 19% tax for every dollar you made on Bitcoin gainz

Why? Energy is a finite (but growing) resource. If it makes economic sense to spend a shitload of energy on securing the bitcoin blockchain, people will buy that energy and apply it to hashrate. When it stops making economic sense, that energy input will decrease until it makes sense again. Its a self correcting feedback loop.
Do you really think the world works like that? If bitcoin users pay a shitload of money for bitcoins to be mined and secured, that money goes to miners, and then energy providers, who are then incentivized to generate more energy.

It's centralised in who mines it, who develops for it, who runs nodes for it, and who holds bags of it. So it's infinitely less attractive than Bitcoin solely for these factors. You may hold your keys, but deadalnix could write soft fork code blacklisting your address. The unknown pool with 98% hash rate could deign not to mine any transactions from your address. The value your key represents is permently under threat of bag holder dumping from the un known mining pool, Ver etc Etc.

Bitcoin Core is the most trustless, in that you are not trusting other nodes to return correct balances and transactions to you because you have a full copy of the blockchain to query. That isn't the same as security in terms of malware resistance or data leakage (not saying Bitcoin core is bad, just that there are different types of security here)

@_date: 2017-10-12 03:46:34
The benefits of a seed over a private key.
Seed = 12 english words, non case sensitive, hard to fuck up misspelling. Can be used to store multiple currencies across multiple accounts and multiple addresses. 
Private key = A 256 bit random alphanumeric, case sensitive jumble of nonsense. Easy to fuck up, only represents value for a single address on (generally) a single currency.
Let me explain hardware wallets. They have two functions.
1) Safely generating a 12 word seed in a secure environment. You can do this without a HW, but it involves downloading a generator, downloading a secure operating system, generating in that, printing it out, then destroying your printer and your computer if you actually want to be 100% safe. Or you can do it a hundred times safely on a HW in about 1 minute. They do not come with pre-generated seeds from the factory, and the RNG used should be as good or better than anything running in software on a desktop.
2) Spending safely and quickly. If you want to move or spend that paper wallet, you need to repeat the whole fucking process for generating a paper wallet, and then copy that transaction to a live online computer. Are you really going to type that 256 bit priv key in? Jesus... enjoy all that work with multiple computer I guess
Yes, a HW is not indestructible. It WILL break at some point. Thats why you have your 12 word seed, stored safely and no differently than a paper wallet. My seeds are encoded onto flood-and-fire proof copper and brass plates.

This is very similar to what I set up. I measured it eating about 6watts after it verified the blockchain, which makes it very cheap to run, about $1 a month. Note it doesnt come with an operating system, so you'd need to either download Ubuntu, or pirate/buy windows 10. Fits in the palm of my hand. I VNC into it from my desktop if I need to configure or change anything. It's currently ranked 1500 out of 9500 nodes.
You could buy a bitseed node if you want something cheaper, or even hack together a raspberry Pi. I find this to be a lot more future proofed and its very easy for me to use having windows 10 on it.

It takes 100 blocks from the time they mine a coinbase to being able to sell it. If Bitcoin even looks like it's going to hold the majority of value, they aren't going to wait 100+ blocks on 2x (potentially days) to see how this fork thing goes. One of them will jump back into btc and that will start a chain reaction of pools fomoing. Without a difficulty adjustment in the s2x fork, it will be just as expensive to mine for only 15% of the reward according to current futures markets. They can't take that risk if S2x doesnt immediately start commanding $4000+ at fork. The only reason bcash got off the ground was EDA, which helped them at the start but is now bleeding their holders dry

Honestly; I'm for this (prepared for the downvotes). 
I researched bitcoin, redraw about $25k on a personal loan and it worked out well for me. 
I recently took out my initial investment, have zero debt for the time time in ten years and I still have tons of profit. Not saying its a good idea; its an idea fraught with risk. But it may also be a good idea if you can manage the loan repayments responsibly and secure your bitcoins and don't fuck around with them trying to time the dip if we're at the top for the next year or two. And I'm saying this only because you're also young with a good income like myself; sounds like you don't have a family or mortgage repayments to worry about. 
When this is a really SHIT idea is when you have big ass financial commitments to meet and you are gambling on bitcoin to moon or else you're bankrupt. Thats a stupid idea. If you have a six figure income and want to lock away a serious amount of bitcoins at todays price, to pay back later, I think thats ok albeit high risk.

Two benefits, privacy and authenticity,
You get privacy by being able to check your own address balances privately and locally on your own copy of the blockchain instead of saying "hey please tell me how much is in X address" to the trezor or blockchain servers.

Nothing, thats why you write down your trezor/ledger seed straight away, and if youre storing it for 20 years you write it down on metal and not paper. The seed that was generated securely by your hardware wallet and not some dodgy downloaded website.

"what if the 80% that have said they will switch to X2"
If you're talking about the 85% of mining hash power, absolutely nothing will change. Bitcoin will survive on 15% of hash just fine after 3 months. Not that it will come to that, because miners will not mine a altcoin currently worth 10% of bitcoin on the futures markets.

It's because there literally won't be a Bitcoin chain for them to develop on. NYAs whole play was to entice Core to come develop their altcoin for them.

one seed = all the altcoins bro.
a hardcopy seed is a lot easier to pass to a loved one on your death than an encrypted file hidden in the cloud somewhere. write it onto copper and it will survive fire and flood, you can add a passphrase that protects it against theft as well

Yes.... but only one of those branches has the 100+ strong cypherpunk developer group that makes up Core and the 7,000 full nodes running the Core implementation. The other two have deadalnix, a bitmain/chinese funded nobody, and Jeff Garzik, whose company is an EEA (ethereum) member...

LOL. You think I'm salty about the value? When I first started buying bitcoin I told my girlfriend there was a possibility it could hit $2000 USD by the end of 2017 and she said I was insane... I was over the moon and wealthy by the time it hit $3k.
So, when I say the value of bcash can be fucked over for you, this isn't a hypothetical. It happened and is still happening now. You should research what EDA is - coded with no understanding of game theory by deadalnix, and exploited to create ruthless hyperinflation of Bitcoin cash by bitmain.
Conversely, the continual optimisations and improvements to Bitcoin by the core developers keep giving it more utility (bring in schnorr, mast and lightning!) attracting more users, which generates more business infrastructure, which has a positive feedback loop on price
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:53:28
So basically, there is one developer (deadalnix) who is paid for by bitmain and R ver. That stuff about multiple implementations is crap - just look at their git commit histories to get an idea for the vibrancy of their developer community. 
As for mining, there is one miner who controls 98% of the hashrate, which is pretty much conclusively bitmain.
They can't steal your coins, but they can fuck the value of them over

Let me spell it out for you since you don't seem able to keep up: there is a 100% probability that you swallowed the lie of Bcash being equivalent of somehow superior to actual Bitcoin. Common signs include; warning altcoins will superseed bitcoin, throwing out false numbers regarding tx fee costs with no context of your wallet algo, utxo set or even sat/byte rate, and a throwaway line perpetrating the myth that segwit transactions are insecure/signatureless.

I bought dumplings with bitcoins from a food truck recently (direct to seller without fiat conversion). Tell me again how only government dollars can be used as a medium of exchange?


This was a mishmash of illogic.


The value of money? What money? Bitcoin is money. That money? I'll assume you are talking about fiat dollars.


Except this is not true, governments can control the supply but they can't control the demand. Do you know one of bitcoins primary utility cases? The fact its a money that exists outside of government control and ability to increase the supply.
Look at the Bolicar or Zimbabwean dollars. Look at the 'amazing real strength and value' those currencies have with the awesome and mighty power of government backing and a controllable (manipulable) supply. 


This is all so abitrary and subjective. Are you over 40? Because the millenials I know have no to very little interest in anything about gold, but find the idea of storing unforgeable tokens digitally incredibly interesting. And the next generation is going to be even more open to that.


Uhm, that's not interesting in the slightly. Literally every currency is valued in relation to every other currency when you exchange them. Thats actually how FX swaps work, for everything, for obvious reasons. Otherwise 1 btc = 1 btc.
These are some of the more boring boring questions that have been rehashed and debunked over the last half a decade. If you don't have any actually interesting and new arguments to make, you no longer have my attention

No thanks. Too many people running into bitcoin (ie; financial collapse) could raise the limit so fast that 90%+ nodes are booted off the network.

Edit: Safe being a relative term. I use it to mean a less than 1% chance of failure. I wouldnt even take that.
Edit2: The reliability of the single isolated component that holds the PrivKey might have the manufacturer pull a wild fucking guess of 25-100 years out of their ass, but you need to go with the minimum expected lifespan of every single component on the Opendime, and the aggregate chance that any one of them might fail and make it essentially lost. Hence my 5-7 year number.
Edit3: Opendime is a good, interesting concept but fuck no you should not be using it for long term cold storage. You are literally playing with fire and begging to get burnt if this is a college fund for your kids or something meaningful. This is why we have things like cryptosteel.

I believe the immovability of Satoshis coins is priced in, while acknowledging there is only the absence of proof. Your choice of words for 'deserves' the coins is worrying. He mined them. That's all the 'deserving' anyone needs in this system of cryptographic proof and mathematical trusts.

Profile? No. Your UTXOs (the actual bitcoin values) are stored on the blockchain in over 100,000 copies.
To access them you need your private key. Which can be 'compressed' into a 12 word (english) seed.
Engrave those 12 words onto a flood proof, fire proof material like copper or stainless steel. Make it theft proof with a passphrase.
Voila, immutable coins and now an immutable way to access them.

Fair enough. The fees are determined by your wallet sofware. You can manually set a fee of a few cents on all good wallets and it will go through in a few hours usually. I guess you're out of luck in this case then. If Blockchain. Info enabled segwit then it would be a whole lot cheaper too..

@_date: 2018-02-23 20:44:22
You were one of the main proponents for segwit2x. You backed it not only personally, but with your company.
Lets be factual: 2X was a coercive hard fork, with no replay protection, zero developer support beyond Garzik and abysmal levels of community support.
The only serious support it had was from a bunch of mal-acting Chinese mining pool CEOs who understood very clearly that increasing the blocksize would lead to progressive levels of centralization, set dangerous precedents regarding consensus and increase their ability to shape the protocol independent of users and developers.
That 2mb blocks were never going to get any kind of community support was obvious to everyone from early August - yet you continued to push the attack for another 3 months, stealing resources from Core that should have gone to segwit support (only finally seeing it now), draining resources from exchanges, stressing users/potential buyers and shrouding the entire ecosystem in a cloud of uncertainty.
If you were successful, the lack of developer support means that Garzik's non-peer reviewed code would have destroyed the network that has been running without fault since 2009.
We fought hard against you, your company and all the others who tried to take control of bitcoin on May 23rd in New York.
The only person who had the self-awareness to admit they made a mistake was Wences, and it went a lot of the way to repairing some of the damage he helped cause - but yet you continue to act like you weren't caught with your hand in the $200 billion cookie jar.

@_date: 2017-10-08 01:24:14
The scalability debate is not, and probably never will be solved.
2mb, or even 32mb blocks are fine and an inevitability at some point.. the key is doing them safely with regards to user funds and maintaining decentralization, with lots of testing, and most importantly, widespread consensus (s2x has none of these things).
As for withdrawing s2x, that is entirely dependant on the policy of each exchange. If you actually own your bitcoin though, its irrelevant what they do because you have access to both straight away.

How were you going to store it? You can only send Bitcoin from a Bitcoin wallet to a Bitcoin wallet. Not a google wallet or an email address. The only exception is if you stored the private key in a written form (dangerous as fuck in an online email account)

So to summarise, two algos;
Sha256 proof of work; immune to quantum efficiency attacks
ECDSA transaction signing; has had quantum resistance since 2011/2012 in the form of hashing the public key to obsfucate the address (with sha256!), however article says ecdsa could be broken by 2027. 
I agree with that; the thing is that nobody expected ecdsa to last forever. The network has the capability to upgrade the signing algorithm, and if quantum computers exist for bruteforcing ecdsa, they will exist for more powerful encryption as well.

I seriously envisage (some) fiat currencies as being 'backed' by bitcoins. They will be paper m/ubtc and satoshi coins that a federal reserve will promise to honor for (real) BTC on the blockchain. 
And yes.. there will be a fractional reserve system evolving out of it, but hopefully the transparency of the BTC blockchain will stop it getting too crazy.

In January this year, I was $50,000 deep in consumer debt from loans Id carried with me since I was 18 years old.  After I bought my first bitcoin, the understanding I started gaining about money inspired me to take control of my finances. 6 months later I am now down to the last $5,000 of debt while also gaining a modest account of coins on the dips. I don't think it would have happened otherwise.

You actually won't make any money. Most pools will pay you out once you hit certain thresholds of 'earned' balance with them, such as $10 worth of bitcoins (otherwise it will spam the network and be eaten by transaction fees). 
However you will not ever earn $10 of bitcoin with a computer, not with 10 computers.

No, not at the same level. I loaded the same seed into my trezor as on my keepkey. To view my bitcoin balance, I had to connect it to the trezor site. To view my ethereum balances, I had to connect to another site, MEW. I then could only see one of my ethereum balances, and had to manually plug in different HD path values until I found where my secondary eth account was sitting. Thats fine for me but not something I want to handwalk my friends through who are already (rightly scared) about hitting the wrong buttons and somehow wiping their coins forever.
Keepkey I just opened the google addon and all accounts on all currencies were sitting there.

Generate a 12 word seed on a hardware wallet.  
Get an address from the seed (on the wallet). 
Write down the address &amp; Wipe the wallet. 
Send 1btc to that address. 
Now etch the 12 word seed onto a credit card size copper rectangle off etsy (or you could buy a cryptosteel).
Ta-da... now you have the seed for an address containing 1btc that has never touched the internet, in a metal form that will survive fire, food and several decades of time.

Why would you keep the wallet?
1) It's another attack vector if it gets stolen
2) Hes not planning to spend the coins in 18 years. Do you really think the wallet would be functional in 2 decades? USB 2.0 ports and chrome browser extensions?
The BIP39 seed protocol will be functional as long as bitcoin is, but you're kidding yourself if you think the hardware and software will still be relevant in 2040.

Coinjar (OTC Exchange), BTCMarkets (Trading exchange) or LocalBitcoins (P2P marketplace  - I recommend bitcoinbabe) are your best bets. They have tradeoffs of convenience vs price but all are relatively safe. 
Edit: And if you hold over $1,000aud worth,  get yourself a trezor or ledger hardware wallet,
