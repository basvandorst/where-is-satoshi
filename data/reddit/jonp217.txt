What happens when a woman seduces a bitcoin investor?

Bits could also refer to smaller units of etherium  or litecoin if people wanted because they can be broken down into bits. If you see a sign that says 823 bits for a buffet plate in the future you might have to ask which coin is it a bit of.

Bits of what? Do you say bitcoin bits? You can't just say bits because it could mean bits of anything.

How do you claim Bitcoin Gold without using Coinomi?

I'm talking about an automatic conversion where the users don't even know that it went from one coin and back.

You could do it if it gets to $10,000 you get one bitcoin and if it goes to $100 you lose ten bitcoin.

Can we all agree to use one timescale so it's easier for noobs to understand??

There's no fee from gdax to a hw wallet? What about to any other wallet?

Exchange your bitcoin for dollars and put it all in an index fund. Take a safe withdrawal rate of 4% per year and you'll live very comfortably for the rest of your life.

Don’t cash out all at once or you’ll be paying tax on $500k. Take out just what you need for one year’s living expenses.

If I wanted to be funny, I would have casually took a five ounce bar of gold out of my pocket and placed it on the table. I probably would have it indented with the bitcoin symbol.

You're right. Math is hard.

BCH is spiking while bitcoin and a lot of alt coins are falling slightly. Reminds me a little of last week. We also have a downward trend from its all time high and each point of support. I'm no expert but that's just what I think.

It's up 21% over the last day. Seems like a spike to me.

I'm not talking about the immediate dip from the ath.

From what I understand, you just input your bitcoin private key into the bitcoin gold wallet.

Why do so many people hate on Segwit2x? The block size will double, which means the transactions per second will also double, and the average confirmation time and transaction fee will likely be much lower. I feel like Segwit2x is future proofing the blockchain.
