Technically someone in Venezuela to feed their family can sell of something in gold or even an old cellphone across the border in Colombia - and while there put it in a prepaid card and buy bitcoin online from just about anywhere and send it to their wallet. they would still be x10s richer than trying to do it with their native currency

Are you guys really this stupid....How the heck can the price of one Bitcoin be worth $500,000 - what are you smoking. The inflation caused by the devaluing of currencies would cancel it all out. Unless of course he means that the dollar would be that devalued. So then $500,000 would really be like $5 in Today's terms.

If Bitcoin is ever worth a million US dollars - then that would have meant that Hyper inflation has set in.
