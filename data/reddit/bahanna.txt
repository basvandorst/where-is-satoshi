There are infinitely more forms of regulation, including no changes at all except prosecuting these folks. That would also be regulation.

Specifically, the state has the burden of proving guilt. The accused shouldn't have to prove their innocence. If the state can only prove that *some* of the money was from the sale of illegal items, then they should only keep that *some/sum* of the bitcoins.

So, they're not accepting bitcoin now and they would continue to not accept bitcoin; I don't see the downside.


Therein lies the question: Does bitcoin offer retailer a low-risk opportunity to profit. Honestly, I don't think there is any argument to the contrary. Retailers can immediately convert BTC to USD, so there's virtually no risk regarding the market's volatility. There's also no ~2% fee to the credit card company. There is also no charge-backs. 
Even if it's just used as an intermediary currency and has no "inherent" utility, it works for their particular purposes. 
And more to the point of your response: It doesn't require they spend $100 on a box of e-cigs (or anything at all) and risk not selling enough.

Well, there are lots of video cameras at ATMS/gas stations, so there would be lots of people on tape doing so. Then again, this vandalism is so minor that I doubt many business owners would bother to tell the cops, and am certain the cops wouldn't care.
Gas station clerks would probably get a few questions about it. Most would be from people who don't use BTC, but the questions would still pique the interest of the teller - which if I know much about gas stations - is surprisingly often the franchise owner, and quite entrepreneurial. He'd search the internet and discover it's easy to receive BTC, but installing something on the pumps would be difficult and costly. Being reasonable and frugal/cheap he'd want customer to come inside and pay at the counter. Accordingly, he'd need a sticker that said **"Bitcoin Accepted at Counter"** or **"Bitcoin Accepted Here, see clerk."**
All in all, they'd probably start accepting bitcoin.

Yes. I agree it is better to not spam. 
Spamming will probably help spread BTC more than it hurts (given BTC's current position), but it will turn some people off to the idea. Asking politely will do 99% as good and won't turn anyone off, thus the overall impact will be larger.

How does taxation work for a British person selling stuff into the US?

If you mean "no one is going to act on that" to suggest no one will sue, then you're right. However, there will be people who avoid him, refuse to do business with him, instruct others to do the same, etc. upon the belief that he did those things that the investigative officers said he did. So saying "he did it" as opposed to "I personally think he probably did it" does matter.

What do you imagine the alternatives to be?

Greek can't buy bitcoin with euros, or maybe even accept payment in euros (with their bank closed), but they can accept bitcoin for the products / services they export.
It's a hypothesis.

The constitution is the supreme law of the land, but powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states.
So getting back to the question:


It's not because the federal government gave states those powers, but rather those power's have not been taken from the states.
*Could* the federal government pre-empt most, if not all, local licensing regimes through a comprehensive, federal regulatory scheme? Yes, it's within their authority. However, for example, the junior senator from Kentucky is literally a representative of the state of Kentucky and acts and votes on behalf of the state and its citizens. He or she relies on state-level political networks to be elected.
They receive their donations from businesses in the state that have already complied with the local regulations and now benefit from the anti-competitive/protectionist effects of forcing any would-be start-ups to invest [two million dollars]( for the privilege of competing. A federal scheme would also cost these businesses money by forcing them to learn and comply with new and different regulations, even if the regulations are equivalent in costs and effect. So... those businesses oppose the changes and as a result the state of Kentucky, acting literally in congress with the other states, refuses to give up that power.

The states and localities, as a group, are older than the federal government. So it's less of trying to keep the feds in check and more of refusing to let go of power. Heck, the states almost ruined the whole national experiment with that Articles of Confederation bullshit.

The way I see it, a government without the threat of violence is the same as no government at all. What could be done to incapacitate violent criminals other than use force to restrain them?
By way of anecdote: Yesterday, a man approached me as I waited beside a grocery store. He seemed to have designs of governing my conduct under threat of violence... it seemed like he was considering trying to rob me. Unless I'm mistaken, he changed his mind based on the threat of violence facing him. I was part of that threat, but the government's threat of violence was *working for me.*
This isn't to say that government isn't a usurper and tyrant, but that we are part of government and that enemy is ourselves.

If a minimum standard is set, then yeah, states can impose stricter standards. However, Wickard v. Filburn is a good segway into why states can't always impose a stricter standard.
In that case the federal government put a limit on the amount of wheat folks could grow. However, suppose that the states then imposed stricter limits on wheat production... This would interfere with the federal regulation; wheat supplies would drop even further than intended; the price of wheat would lift way too high; the purpose of the law would be frustrated. 
So, no, states wouldn't be free to ruin the uniformity of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.

Do you oppose government entirely or should its funding be voluntary? If the latter, then what's the difference?
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:15:44
Yeah, well, I don't really disagree with you, but I still feel like arguing so take that.
