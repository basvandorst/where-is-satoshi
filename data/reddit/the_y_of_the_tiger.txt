I'm sure they don't care about 99.9999% of them.  The chances of them coming after you based on an internet post are effectively zero. But you're leaving a digital footprint that you may think is untraceable now.  And if/when computing power explodes (perhaps quantum computing) I think there's a decent chance that most everything people think is anonymous online could be revealed.  And at that point, it might not be difficult for someone to write an algorithm to find people who racked up crypto gains and didn't pay their taxes.  Also, it's entirely possible that someday something will happen that leads authorities to investigate you for completely unrelated reasons.  And if that investigation leads to you bragging about committing tax fraud, that would really suck.

Bragging on social media about felony tax evasion probably isn't a great idea.  Just sayin.

I disagree. Some of us here don't believe.  I think crypto can eventually be very powerful and important but I think 95% of people here are deluding themselves in a circle jerk fantasy about coins being worth lots of money and being used for everyday transaction.
Now don't get me wrong, I have some crypto, and I hope to make money on an irrational bubble, but it's really hard to see how people can both make money with BTC and it be a stable value currency that is used broadly.

Thanks - I meant which exchange will charge me the lowest fees, and I was/am hoping that folks here will tell me from their experience which ones are lowest so I don't have to check every site manually.  So far it looks like Kraken is my best bet.

I agree with you and suspect that 90% of people here disagree.

Meh... it costs money to maintain a network of physical machines that dispense cash on demand.  It will likely be the same for crypto if/when there becomes physical dispensers somehow.

Sorry but you couldn't be more wrong.  If Bitcoin doesn't grow and become broadly used it will die.

Sorry but that is not the law.  The Internal Revenue Code is very broad.  If you make money doing ... pretty much anything ... you are legally supposed to report it and pay taxes on it.  If you make $10K in a year trading Warcraft gold and you don't report it, and someone narcs on you and the IRS investigates, you could be looking at a felony.
