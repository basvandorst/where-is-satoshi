Yeah, I was just trying it out and my internet is even taking a while to respond.

What are the advantages of the blockchain download though? Surely there must be one.

Shoot. My computer shut down due to low battery and when I restarted it and tried to start the program back up, it says that the program won't respond. Will I have to restart everything now? Or what? Thanks for the info though.

Yeah, it's not a MacBook Pro or anything. It's a newer MacMini with decent hardware (not great, obviously though). But thanks.

Thanks. I now understand why it’s doing that.

Pretty much, yeah. I've also got a Windows 7 desktop, so that might be better anyway. I just am on my Mac a lot more because my Windows 7 is on the same monitor and there's more things that I do with Macs.
Thanks for the warning though!

Ah okay. Is it any faster or anything? I'm new to this whole thing and the only think I know is that I need to have a client like the one I'm installing.

It's not a MacBook Pro or anything, but yeah, I do agree with you on it. I'd need more stuff.
And thanks for the link.

Interesting. Maybe I'll try both out and see which I like better. Thanks!

Fear not, for it has started back up and is continuing the synchronization. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:25:34
Awesome. Thank you for the explanation. It makes a lot of sense!
