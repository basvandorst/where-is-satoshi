Rich people don't need to act rich. They are rich. I once got an occasion to meet someone extremely rich and influential in a parking lot. I was exited that I would see his car, I wondered what type of exotic supercar or luxury limousine he would be driving. He drove a fuckin Chrysler Pacifica minivan.

My bank has free money transfers and no monthly fees so bitcoin is still more expensive and slower to use.

I don't know any random people from around the globe but I know some Chinese sellers of cheap stuff on Aliexpress and my money transfers from my bank to them were free and almost instantaneous.

I bought some guitar picks on Aliexpress 2 days ago. The bank transfer to China was free and took less than 5 minutes. I also have chargback protection in case I don't get them or they don't fit the description. How does it work? Who knows, who cares. The money transfer was fast and free so it was good enough for me.

So buying drugs and child porn on the internet is supposed to be  Bitcoin's killer app?

I sent 60 000 USD for a car to another country by a bank using a laptop. No fucking way I would send 60 000 USD to another country so I would lose 6 000 USD in a day before somebody could turn the bitcoins into actual money. 
I never sent money to wikileaks nor do I plan to if they need money why don't they just ask Putin? 
Not everybody is a priviliged NEET living in the US with their parents and can lose 10% of their life savings in a day LOL

Yeah that illiterate goatherder from Somalia is totally going to turn into a techno-anarchist and give up his tiny stash of 23 USD that he saved up over the last decade after he reads Satoshi's whitepaper. 
You can transfer your money using your phone in places like Somalia. I don't think they care much about verification as long as the owner of the phone pays his bills.

You only have to inform them about the place where they can send you snail mail. I am registered in one place but I live in another place. The bank doesn't give a damn where I live.

Guess what I have on my phone? A banking app. The app is linked to a bank account that I opened online and by mail without visiting a bank in the year 2005.
So if somebody has a phone or a computer with internet access he can also have a bank account. 
So how exactly is Bitcoin supposed to reach the unbanked before the banks do?
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:21:26
Luckily there is this new economic concept called "making a profit" which means banks will reach the unbanked as soon as technologicaly possible. 
There is a reason banks like to give special accounts for broke students even when they don't make any money on them because those broke students will probably be not broke in the future.

You don't. A trusted relative acts as a post box you give him a call once in a while and ask if there was any mail for you.


Depends on the place where you were born. The same way people register home births, not everyone is born in a hospital. And in places where birth certficates are not really a thing you don't need a birth certificate. I never needed to show my birth certificate to my bank to register an account.
