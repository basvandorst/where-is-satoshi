Localbitcoins should get their act together and protect their users better.  They're turning into a joke.

I've been using it for quite some time now and so far paxful is pretty decent. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:21:54
I usually buy mine from paxful. No issues so far. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:03:05
Yet I hear some redditors claim its the most decentralized exchange out there. Bisq isn't for active traders either or for anyone really. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:11:00
I haven't heard about this before. Is this a new thing?  
@_date: 2018-10-11 09:31:49
I've lost count on the amount reddit threads I've read about users losing money there.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:06:56
That's really messed up when you think about it more
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:09:54
I heard there is only 1 arbitrator in the system and it isn't as decentralized as everyone says.  Bisq demands two forms of National Photo Identification in the process of having a dispute resolved.

It's just I see the term 'working immigrant' painted terribly in the news all the time I think the lines between 'expat' and 'working immigrant' are a blurred
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:01:51
I'd like to assume you understand the risks of going into sites with no kyc.

I just want to add how people should be really careful about gift card trading.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:54:17
There are tons of good suggestions here but from personal experience, I started with p2p marketplaces because of a roommate of mine introduced me to trading bitcoins using gift cards. I think that's the easiest way of buying bitcoin if you're new. Start with trading using small amounts to get the hang of it if you're interested in this type of trading.

Nobody trusts localbitcoins these days
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:46:36
Is 'Expatriate' synonymous to 'Working Immigrant'?
@_date: 2018-11-02 12:05:04
They took over Africa...where will they go next? 
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:51:56
That's actually quite possible, you can see that trend in Africa
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:20:29
I agree as a former localbitcoins user myself I just find paxful to be a lot better in general 
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:59:03
One of the golden rules of investing in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-13 10:48:12
I wouldn't be surprised at this point if LocalBitcoins is actually run by a cartel.
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:47:12
Have you tried p2p crypto marketplaces?
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:42:36
It's  what made me stick to the site, to be honest. It very easy on the eyes. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:39:36
Really? I didn't know that
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:06:19
Yeah, it happens.
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:23:56
I heard they announced a paxful 2.0 on their facebook. I'm not entirely sure what's going to happen with the site
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:17:00
There aren't a lot of traders in bisq
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:53:15
I agree with everything you said, except the localbitcoins part. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:37:25
When you win, does it factor in taxes?
