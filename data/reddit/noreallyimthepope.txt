Hey, I’m offended. I’m a fascist and I support more free speech than that.

The article states "the same technology as is behind bitcoins", so it seems to be not BTC itself, but something "specialised".
Wouldn't that open up to some sort of tampering by simply investing in a large enough set of other computers?

I don't know that it's a competition with funding olympic teams. I mean, if your reason for donating is that you want to beat out dogecoin, by all means, that's more money in the pot, I just don't see why it is brought up.

Hold your horses. The app was designed to be [surreptitiously changed after approval]( so it should never have been in the App Store as the *real* functionality was against the iTMS TOS. 
Whether those Terms are good or bad, Blockchain.info *clearly* worked in bad faith to circumvent the Terms of Service.
What worries me most is that this behaviour couldn't be caught by Apple.

Once they have *something* on you, they can now almost instantly get *more* on you just to keep you in line.
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:02:26
What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:51:52
Maybe they're afraid of being tainted by association by someone being burned by someone else using bitcoin.

This entire "controversy" started by Apple removing an app from the App Store that had previously been available.

Because they are convenient to use and they have functions that most consumers are content with?

And agree with Russia that it was a "GPS slipup"? Russie upped the stakes so much that it's not going to be so simple, I think.

Holy shit. I recently bought less than USD 100 worth of BTC and was slightly annoyed that it was down a little. 20K is just unfathomably much for me.

Wow. How much fiat did you pour into those 100 to begin with?
If you still have som BTC lying around, consider getting paper wallets and divvying it up in several small hoards
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:40:20
Ouch, so not a big pot of initial money at least. Still, a lot of time and effort to get there. Are you recovering?

I've scraped together 1.8 BTC (and consequently, BCC) over the last year, and about 60% of that in alts. I kick myself for not doing more to get in when I first heard about BTC... I'd be richer than Creosote now.

Why'd you write like that?

You have no idea how apt that is. That character is a major cause for the problems and he adds no value to the company.

Huh, happy to hear that. I have 2 BTC in deep storage, and I hadn't checked in about 6 months on how it was faring.
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:23:15
Yeah, now I've been checking every few days. Not as fun as finding the increase over the past 6 months :-)

Since they're making money on transactions, I honestly think they're getting DDoS'ed.

I buy every now and then and have mostly HODLED for a couple of years. I don't use more than I can afford to lose; think of it like lottery tickets. You might win, you might lose, so **don't use money you can't afford to lose**.
I've also a little money riding on ETH and less still on LTC. I think my ETH is about 10 times what I bought them for, initially, but if I had HODLed my initial ETH instead of sloshing them back to BTC at the time, it'd have been **50** instead. Like I said, a lottery.
