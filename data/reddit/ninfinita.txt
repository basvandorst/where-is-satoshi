The problem is Coinbase is a bank and they have complete control over the money you store with them. That kind of situation demands customers have incredible trust in them, so horror stories from fellow customers can be very concerning. 
In my case, I was a loyal customer and then one day out of the blue, BAM, my account was frozen. I have been trying to work with customer service for over a month now to resolve the situation. Fortunately I didn't have any money stored with them at the time. 
The problem is the company is treating me and other customers like shit and yet also expects us to trust them implicitly with our money. It makes no sense. You have to hope that all of these customers who are getting screwed just happened to deserve it and that it will never happen to you. That's how I thought until it happened to me. Why would anyone store large amounts of money at Coinbase knowing that at any moment they could mistakenly accuse you of some "improper" use of bitcoin and freeze or cancel your account, separating you from your money?
With exchanges like MtGox you had to worry about your money disappearing from it being stolen from the exchange. With Coinbase, you have to worry about your money disappearing from the exchange stealing it from you.

The hitmen story has proven essential in getting the public to swallow the life in prison sentence. Yet no evidence for this story has even been presented to my knowledge. Right now it seems more likely that it was simply part of a larger PR campaign, injected into the narrative at a time when the government alone had a monopoly over that narrative and no obligation to prove the entirety of it. Exaggerate the charges, prove only a portion of them and the public will assume the unproven charges true also. The public thus accepts a much harsher sentence than should be warranted yet it is unclear whether the surrounding narrative will even be remembered when this ruling is viewed as legal precedent against cyber crime.

The thing is, selfishness and competition are also what ultimately leads the most powerful players in a capitalist system to take control of government and write laws that secure their power, in the end destroying free competition.

Good point. Capitalism is a profoundly pessimistic system, one that concedes that humans are basically scum and just tries to work with that bitter reality. By working with it, rather than against, Capitalism is able to best harness the energy of assholeness, so to speak.
If we want to use "people are dicks" as the underlying assumption that fuels an economy, then capitalism is most definitely the best. But maybe it is time to consider using an "alternative energy", an alternative underlying economic philosophy.
The critical thing is that much of the selfishness paradigm is rooted in natural scarcity. But in the digital age we are often finding that that scarcity can only be reproduced artificially.

Your concerns are with monopoly giants like Comcast getting too much power. The thing is, the government is essentially a monopoly power too, one that uses its regulatory powers to shape industries according to the whims of special interests. Net neutrality wasn't about simply preventing ISPs from throttling internet traffic, net neutrality was about apply the Communications Act of 1934 to internet providers, it is about giving government regulatory power over the internet that opens the flood gates for all kinds of abuses. Now our concern won't be with a big giant corporation throttling internet traffic to Netflix, a problem that can often be at least gotten around by switching providers, it will be the government mandating all ISPs collectively block traffic to certain IP addresses the government deems illegal. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:46:54
I understand the need and desire for net neutrality laws in order to limit private corporate monopolies from censoring the internet, but in today's post-NSA world in which the government is doing everything in their power to crack down on file sharing and is demonstrating more and more interest in internet censorship, why is giving the government more power over the internet a good thing? It is just a matter of time before that power becomes corrupt.

Marriage is a legal contract in our society. Being a legal contract, it is naturally of concern to the law, which is government. 


No one is stopping anyone from freely loving each other. The issue, again, is when two people attempt to gain a certain status in the face of the law. Marriage is an attempt to gain extra benefits, and the argument of gay rights advocates is that it is unfair that heterosexual couples should be given these benefits and not homosexual ones. But how can the government "aggressively violate your rights to free association" by simply refusing to give you extra benefits? 
States rights allows a decentralization of these issues to occur which promotes the possibility for change. If left to the Federal government, gay marriage would probably be no further today than it was fifty years ago. It is because states could individually explore this issue and come to their own conclusions that one by one they moved the country as a whole in the right direction until, eventually, the federal government will concede. But without this process in the first place to play out politically through the states, I doubt Washington is flexible enough to have made it happen.

Regulation seems to just move where the criminal activity takes place, it doesn't actually eliminate it. It is like how in a totalitarian state there may be very little crime, but that is because the government has simply monopolized it. The financial crisis of 2008 was really due to rampant criminality, yet this took place in one of the most heavily regulated industries on the planet. 
The criminal behavior in the bitcoin space will never go away with regulations, it will simply be moved to a location perhaps more palatable to the public.

Even though Wright didn't fool the bitcoin community, his name and face were plastered all over the media which presented the whole thing as, at worse, an open question. You have very prominent members of the community declaring him Satoshi, an average person reads this in a newspaper and concludes that there must be a good chance he is Satoshi. And the average person doesn't understand the reasons others in the community are skeptical, as far as they know the denials could be political or ideological or motivated out of fear of losing the Satoshi myth.
 All of this is just to say that Wright now has the tools to fool a judge, or at least manipulate the legal system and reasonable doubt to his advantage. And given his profound skill as a con man, if that is what he is, he now has both the tools (all the media coverage saying he is Satoshi) and the skill to trip up the legal system and complete his 54 million dollar heist.

The idea is that if you have a system where power ultimately decides the political and economic spheres, and centralization and monopolies are inevitable over time, it is best just to concede this fact and make a primary monopoly that is, at least, democratically elected and in theory beholden to the people, rather than wait for one monopoly to eventually become the one that rules them all yet lacks all accountability and is beholden to no one. Historically, people didn't just one day collectively decide to give all the power to one person, the king. That position achieved its monopoly status over millennia of competition, then it became etched into the nature of the "system" and no one questioned it.
The dilemma isn't government, it's power. If you get rid of government but keep power, you will still end up with government. 'Government' simply refers to the principal power in a world of competing powers.

Excellent question. Something isn't right with Gavin's role in all of this and people's assumption he was simply conned doesn't add up. Gavin was the whole reason Wright was even taken seriously. Without Gavin, Wright wouldn't have gotten anywhere, Gavin was the key. 
And yet, at the same time, Gavin served no additional function outside of validating Wright. Had Wright actually been Satoshi, Gavin's endorsement wouldn't have been needed. The *only* possible function of such an endorsement  would be to convince people in the advent that Wright wasn't actually Satoshi.

I really loved Coinbase for their actual service. It's just they ruined it with their ridiculous KYC demands, they locked my account because they didn't agree with how I spent my money -- which is completely contrary to the freedom Bitcoin is meant to represent -- and it took over a month of trying before I could reach an actual representative who could help me. I just told them to close my account.
But my frustrated user experience was just the beginning. Around the same time the CEO of Coinbase started publicly taking a position in the Bitcoin civil war in which he voiced the most hostile rhetoric ever expressed by a public figure against the Bitcoin core devs. This just confirmed to me that the Big Brother methods of their company, spying on what their users do with their own money,  is not just because they have to comply with KYC laws, it is actually part of their philosophy. They want to turn all of Bitcoin into Coinbase, and this is a serious threat to Bitcoin I won't personally take part in. It means I don't recommend the company the way I used to to friends, and warn others occasionally in public forums like these. Fortunately, Coinbase has screwed so many people -- and most are ordinary people, you can tell from their post histories -- my experience seems to be the norm and my warnings don't stand out as unusual.
