Without the "even if difficulty remains static", I would agree with you. There are definitely profitable miners at $0.10 kWh.

I showed him a website that just had an address and not a QR code. He had to then pull it up on his phone in order to copy and paste. Granted, I bet it took less time to do that than to type it out and check and double check it.
As far as seeing the balance, I meant on the "Send" page so if I have .15489498 BTC... I don't have to memorize that number quickly before sending.

Yeah, but it's not like we're suddenly going to have 20x the transactions. Therefore node operators will still have plenty of time to upgrade their storage space.

Maybe this is a dumb question, but 20 mb is really just the block size limit... right? So if that's true and block sizes are currently under 1 mb... won't they still be under 1mb just with the ability to be larger?

I just realized this a few minutes ago. I wonder if more people were like me thinking that every block is going to be 20 mb. If they think that... no wonder they think it's crazy.

The current standard makes sense. Why are you so against writing down 12-24 words on a piece of paper?
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:26:05
You're gonna need to write the words down in any solution that fulfills all of your requirements because that's how standard HD wallets are created.
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:52:57
You mentioned desiring a password that never shows on screen, but you never said why you thought seed words were insecure. 
If you're worried about screen capture, shouldn't you be just as worried about a keylogger?
Paper is very easy to back up and store. You can make as many copies as you like, laminate them, engrave the words in metal, etc...
In regards to physical security, you could encode the words using some sort of cipher and destroy the original copy of what you wrote down. This would leave you knowing a "password" or scheme in order to decrypt the seed words. You can also split the words up into as many locations as you are willing to commit to memory.

I don't think many people buy bitcoin to immediately pay for something with it. You buy, hold, spend, buy, hold spend, etc..

@_date: 2016-09-13 12:46:55
Four or five days ago includes two non-business days. Transferring money can take longer than that. So considering banks haven't even opened yet (assuming you live in the US), it's only been three days max. You haven't even waited long enough to be worried.
*edit: I may be wrong. [Coinbase Support Article]( states PayPal sells are "instant". Was your sell above your install sell limit? And ARE you in the U.S.? The article also states payouts to PayPal accounts are for U.S. customers only.

Circle SAYS it is a 0% fee, but it really just uses an exchange rate that is higher than other exchanges. 
For example, at the time of writing this post, Circle is $618.24.
Coinbase is $615.43 with an additional $9.17 fee. (1.5%)
GDAX is $612.44 with a fee of $1.53. (0.25%)
So there's still a fee on Circle, it's just hidden.

@_date: 2015-11-01 16:21:01
Once you're setup with Circle or Coinbase, it's really not that hard and there's not really a huge potential to fuck up. The hard part is getting people to sign up for anything Bitcoin related. Yet people will sign up for Apple Pay, venmo, etc... With no hesitation.
@_date: 2015-11-01 05:41:11
For this particular person, you're probably right because of the need for anonymity. BUT I think there are people out there who may just want to accumulate Bitcoin by selling their products or service. Unfortunately, it's damn hard to convince people to buy Bitcoin just to pay some random seller of alpaca socks or web designer or whatever legitimate product/service one might be providing.

Thanks! My first tip!
@_date: 2015-11-01 05:47:53
Why couldn't the payment processor have a contract in place stating that in the case of a chargeback the merchant is liable to pay them back in fiat or risks having their contract terminated? Obviously there is the hassle of it all should a merchant decide to not pay it back but I can't imagine it's THAT risky assuming the processor collects and verifies all the proper information about the merchant.
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:10:41

I guess I've never researched the legality of breaching a contract and from my brief research it seems you are correct. The company could sue the merchant for compensatory damages and attorney's fees which I think would still deter many merchants from running off with the money.

Bitkey uses electrum so I'm kind of familiar. Should I be running it on my PC so I can create and send transactions? Saving me from having to restart bitkey three times for a simple transaction. I'll still sign from a cold-offline, but would that be possible?
What's the benefit of running it on my PC all the time? I don't see myself using bitcoin for payment very often and when I do its not too hard to reboot my computer three times to create, sign, and send the transaction... although after typing that it does seem like a hassle compared to plugging in a trezor.
I think the wallet was probably bitcoin core? Was there much else back then? I remember having to sync the whole blockchain. I remember writing the password down (on a paper long lost and forgotten) so I don't think brute forcing it is an option. It was long. Letters numbers and symbols...

I hope it's that easy! We'll find out. I need to get an external enclosure for old IDE drives.

Give them both and you keep a copy of both so you can check the address in a month or so and if they still haven't transferred it to another wallet you can sweep the balance. Theoretically, you could also print instructions on how to transfer it to a mobile wallet and spend it on foldapp to save 20% at starbucks.

That's why I stopped mining in 2010. I thought it was an "Anonymous" scheme.

This. It's 30 days and they'll raise your limit. They started me off with $100 instant limit last week.

I asked the same thing recently. The answer is no. So you should just buy bitcoin with the fiat you receive for the same effect.

You just create a paper wallet, load it, and keep a copy of the keys.

I just got my first $5 of bitcoin from [Circle's twitter feed](
I wouldn't mind adding to it.
