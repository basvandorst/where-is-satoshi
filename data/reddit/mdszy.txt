It costs absolutely nothing, actually. I managed to have it run totally free on Heroku. I put a little into the faucet initially but a lot of it was from donations.
Unfortunately, though, the ads bring in close to nothing.

I don't really have any way to accept cash, though, Bitcoin is pretty much my only option.
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:20:09
Man, I feel like this is hurting my own bitcoin faucet, [Freecoins]( which in no way, shape, or form helps bots out. I mean, how else other than captchas are faucets supposed to stop bots from constantly requesting payments from the site?
@_date: 2013-03-02 18:32:46
You can apply every week. It pays out every day. I wouldn't mind at all, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-02-24 19:11:14
Yeah, I looked on the documentation right after I said that and found out that I was wrong, thanks again!
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:22:27
Yeah. It just asks that for verification . it won't charge you.  You only have to set up a database, nothing else. The tables are created automatically. 
Edit: also, the name doesn't matter.

Thanks for the support! It makes me want to keep working on things like this when I get support from people who like it! Thanks again! 
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:17:54
Oh alright, one more tonight! No problem, sent out!
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:05:27
@_date: 2013-03-07 12:12:24
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-03-05 00:28:01
That's understandable! I added some information to both the FAQ and the homepage. If you get the chance, let me know what you think!
@_date: 2013-03-11 02:04:10
Ah, I see.
@_date: 2013-03-02 15:12:07
Yeah, I was thinking about doing something like that. I'm currently working on it! Thanks for the support!

@_date: 2013-03-11 01:32:00
... What?
@_date: 2013-03-05 03:03:35
Using GPU mining is pretty much worthless on a regular PC. You really have to invest thousands into a very high-end mining rig involving multiple extremely powerful GPUs. Simply putting GUIMiner on your computer and letting it run isn't going to cut it.
Basically, don't try mining unless you really know what you're doing. I'm not trying to discourage, but if you really want to get into that, get more information and invest in the proper equipment.
In terms of Bitcoin-qt, the application will *not* mine for you. It is simply a wallet management application. That means you can use it to store your bitcoins and to send bitcoins to other people.
About the blockchain, it is a record of every transaction that happens over the bitcoin network. The Bitcoin-qt application has to download this before it can be used, which can take a while.
EDIT: Just to let you know, make sure you have backups of the wallet files that Bitcoin-qt creates. Look in the Bitcoin-qt documentation for what those are, because if you lose those wallet files all of your bitcoins will be gone.
EDIT2: In response to your edit, CPU mining is *entirely* worthless. If you have a cluster of a hundred PCs, none of which are using GPUs, only CPUs, you'll still never generate any number of Bitcoins.

Nice, I feel the same way. I had $0.20 worth of Bitcoins that went up to $0.22 in two days!

@_date: 2013-03-06 02:27:28
It doesn't. It's all the same. I have an android phone w/ICS and just tested it myself on the stock browser and it looks fine. Could you have some setting where it doesn't download certain things or it doesn't run Javascript? The site is heavily dependent on Javascript.

@_date: 2013-02-24 19:06:56
~~Isn't it just +tip?~~ Thanks though!
EDIT: Nevermind, I thought wrong. Thanks a ton!
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:10:04
That's exactly what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to make this as transparent as possible, firstly with the counter showing how much is in the faucet and with the graphs, showing how much was paid out. The only way I make money is with the ads, and so far I haven't made much at all from those.
It isn't open source *yet* though. That's only because some things are hardcoded into it, that'll change soon, hopefully!
@_date: 2013-02-24 18:16:28
Hearing people talk about having even a single BTC makes me sad. I have like 0.0049 :&lt;
@_date: 2013-03-07 12:10:13
Thanks a ton for that! I really appreciate it! 
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:58:37
@_date: 2013-03-03 04:23:34
That's a pretty good idea. I'm gonna try to do a total UI-overhaul of the site, in which case I'll include both addresses. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-02 18:32:03
Not yet. I don't need it to make a ton of money anyways. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:52:49
Did you set up a Mysql database?

Hey, guys! Just to let you know, I did a manual payout. Could someone let me know if it worked?
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:59:20
@_date: 2013-03-10 22:26:22
I'll be working on tidying up the code and adding comments and such, I was just asked by a few people if it would become open source, so here it is! Let me know if you have any suggestions!
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:43:28
Well you don't seem to understand how a bitcoin faucet works. Bitcoin faucets simply give out money, there isn't much of a reason. I'll update the site to make it more obvious if that'd make you feel better, though.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:16:33
What do you mean? Like, it doesn't display? You never get your bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-07 12:11:35
Yeah. I know there will always be people who want to get free money out of things like this. I don't see much of a point in trying to stop it. It's such a trivial amount too. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:12:33
Sent! No worries!
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:02:42
@_date: 2013-03-02 15:44:11
What do you mean? I was frustrated at the lack of BTC faucet sites, so I decided to make one. Why is this "nonsense"?
@_date: 2013-03-07 23:02:29
@_date: 2013-03-02 15:05:32
I just created this separate one so that I can separate Reddit donations from regular site visitor donations. Sorry for the confusion! I'll change it to the one on the page, if that'd be better.
@_date: 2013-03-11 11:16:03
I think it's primarily a lack of clicks.
@_date: 2013-03-09 04:12:28
like I said in the edit, I stopped giving these away yesterday. Sorry. You can still use the faucet site, though! [It's here](
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:35:10
Bitcoin Mining is a serious business, I personally don't know much about it, but I'd be careful with just "jumping in". There's a bit more to it than just buying an ASIC and plugging it in. Especially since these ASICs (especially Butterfly Labs') have been delayed very many times.
Also, no. The cap will *not* be reached by 2014. It'll be reached by **2140** (that is, assuming things don't change, such as the precision going up. The current smallest Bitcoin value is 0.00000001 BTC, or a billionth of a Bitcoin. If that doesn't change, this year is accurate).

I think he means that it does need more heat. Not that Spotify already accepts bitcoins.

I dunno about taking money out of the faucet. It'd look strange if all of a sudden the counter on the site went down.
@_date: 2013-02-25 00:21:20
Banks are one thing. They're physical businesses that have a lot to lose if they do something bad. On the Internet, however, you don't have much to lose. 
@_date: 2013-03-02 14:50:08
Also, if anybody wants to donate to the faucet (This doesn't go to me, this goes into the faucet!) You can use this address: ~~`18yFCRkqaCudWetzKapCStsbK28azeupwk`~~
EDIT: I know I have a different address here than what's on the page, I just did that to separate Reddit donations from other donations. Here's the same address that's on the page: `1M4YQYJ5ssXdSf3wjyNAnP3qZeCBfq6qvc`
@_date: 2013-03-24 03:24:21
Heck yeah! I'd love to help people out, learn more about a subject through helping and learning, and make money at the same time!
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:58:54
@_date: 2013-03-06 00:49:35
That actually seems like a pretty interesting idea! ~~How would it deal with multiple question submissions, though? A queue of some sort?~~
EDIT: Derp, didn't see that you mentioned a queue. That seems interesting, and would really set it apart from other faucets! Thanks for the idea!
One more question, though. Do you think it would be a better idea to have the money given to submit a question go into the faucet or elsewhere?
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:50:48
Pretty interesting idea! It'd make displaying graphs pretty interesting, though.
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:19:26
Notice the bottom: "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength, Censorship is Security" All but the last one (Censorship is Security) are from the book 1984. The wording of it also makes it obvious that it's not a government takedown. "Has been removed" isn't the right wording for anything government related. For instance, [here's the image the FBI put up when they seized megaupload](
Not to mention the fact that SOPA was never actually passed.
This is likely some form of prank/hack.
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:06:51
No problem, man!
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:11:47
I'm sorry, but I stopped sending out yesterday. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:20:10
I'm not sure about Bitcointip, but yeah, mine does use Bitcoin.info as a backend. It's really super useful, especially with the mass-send utility which minimizes the fees, and the ability to query the API for the balance in the faucet's wallet.
Thanks for the tip, by the way!
