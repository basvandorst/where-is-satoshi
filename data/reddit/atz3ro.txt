Please no.  Ever listen to what Glenn Beck says?  He wears that tinfoil hat with pride.  Im even a libertarian, but I still think he needs to tone his rhetoric down.

Day trading in bitcoin is going to be an unbelievable painful experience. The currency is too volatile. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:39:03
OK. I guess I will move it.

Such as?

Fedora 25 is a flavor of Linux. 
A tiling manager is something most operating systems have these days. When you drag a window to the right of the screen in Windows, it snaps to the right half of the screen. You have do the same thing for the left side of the screen. Since Linux is not Windows, OP went out and got his own tiling manager that does the same thing, but it's probably better than Windows. 
OP then said that the tiling manager he uses could be used on any Linux distribution that follows the POSIX standard.

So does my node just have a straight up list of peers?    If that's the case, how do you get added to the lists? What prevents duplicate blocks being sent? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:59:55
So does this mean that the same transaction can be confirmed multiple times in different blocks because of different miners? Or is that the whole point...

Oh you mean like they are ready do with the current tax system? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:42:59

I have no idea what just happened.  I only know of bitcoins from my brief dealings with TOR.  I am here to learn about bitcoins because the US Dollar is soon to be LOLWORTHLESS.  
@_date: 2013-03-18 21:31:45
Because it implies that Bitcoins arent money?  Sorry Im new here.
