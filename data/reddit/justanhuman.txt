Was really fun. Was able to withdraw, send btc back. Nice idea!

Why does it create values?

Could we buy them or they are selling the whole BTCs?

Oh ok but an issue right now is that I do not have any way in getting bitcoin except by buying them. I mean if I am spending some btc I've got to buy them back and everytime I have some fees with the exchange doing it. Not a lot of course, but I end up paying with fiat because of this whole procedure.
A good thing that could happen for btc I guess is the ability to ask an employer to pay a part with fiat and the other part with btc.

Fact that money is not backed anymore by gold and silver or anything untangible opened the pandora box. Biggest scam in history. That is one of the thing I like with btc: there is a finite amount of btc. In a sense that is the digital gold. I guess that is the link between btc and gold.

Sure why not

I am curious (sorry if I sound like a noob because I am one): are exchanges making money when people store their btc on their wallets? I mean one solution could be for exchange to automaticcaly ask for an address wallet when buying after a little amount of time.

Thank you for all these informations. I am not familiar with the local/P2 wallet, could you provide me a link to this service? Is that bitsquare?

Maybe he could wait to know how bitfines is going to manage the hack regarding to the victims.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:54:19
Exactly that is a big limitation.

When will we have this feature in europe?
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:57:00
$2345. Thanks for the contest OP! ��
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:56:38
When can we expect a decision ?
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:22:57
I am also from europe and I use coinbase because it is easy. Kraken could also be good but I find it more complicated but I am a newb.

Oh great! Unfortunatly I just took a screenshot of the 12 words phrase and now they advice me to change my wallet. Several questions:
- I erased the screenshot, would you still change your wallet?
- where have you saved the phrase? Just on a sheet of paper? I am afraid I could lose it;
- if I understood let say I am just losing my phose. So that means I can use another phone, type again this phrase, and retrieve my bc?

Oh ok I understand a little bit better. Thank you for answering me even if I sound naive! I am considering breadwallet for ios but I do not know if I can back it up. Will investigate it.
@_date: 2016-05-30 18:52:17
Wow that is great! Thank you for all these answers and taking from your time to help me! Thank you!

Dumb question: could anyone explain to me what the halvening mean? If I understood there will be twice as btc than there are now right? Does that mean that if you are owing 1btc it will be changed into 2?
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:28:51
Thank you for the answer and the link I understand!
