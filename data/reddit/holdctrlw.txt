@_date: 2018-05-24 13:35:22
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:03:22
It's a the bottom trendline so I would buy now and stop loss at 6800.

Sure I'll buy them at $6800 per pop.

@_date: 2018-06-05 15:45:11
Honestly, I'd be happy with sideways trend for 7 months. After 6 months of downtrend I'll wait a bit longer before I feel like we truly have a reversal.
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:41:15
It's a funky number

I won't enter until we get at least 6-7 confirmations at 7k.

We'll see Tomorrow :) I am only worried because we didn't re-test the trendline for the 3rd time.

- POW is a scaling problem. Looking forward to see how this will go with 10,000x hash power
- Transaction costs are a problem
- Token creation is mandatory for Dapps
- Masternodes are a good solution for stability
- Privacy is a problem
There are coins out there that aim to solve these issues. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:51:28
You mean Russian pesos
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:16:11
Holy shit, winter is that really you?
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:56:09
POW uses a lot of electricity and will use more and more as Bitcoin scales. 
Yes I am sure these things are being worked on. I am just saying until Bitcoin actually has those things implemented people will work on alternatives.
People see a problem and a potential solution so they create a new coin to solve those issues.

"Your investment won't go up in value." Better?
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:18:52
Sorry but this is not true. Bitcoin solves a set of problems, other coins try to solve another subset of problems.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:02:50
Well it's $6500 not $6k so you were wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:33:14
Sure but I think 1 bitcoin is worth a lot more than $10,000.00. The tech already works for what it needs to do and people will pay $10k per BTC soon enough.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:47:37

Tldr? Can't expect people to read more than 2 sentences in 2018.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:20:39
Didn't even push it sub $6k. Weak.
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:05:11
You would have probably sold at +20% anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:43:24
Pretty much same with BTC. If you have 1,000,000 BTC you can only sell at 50% loss
@_date: 2018-06-05 03:40:49
Got in December still up a lot thanks to masternodes
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:28:04
We'll probably see $5k before that happens
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:56:43
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:19:31
Heard they're investing at least $5k

I could write you a novel on how to live happily but in summary the reason you feel small is because you need to figure out what makes you happy.
Find all the small things that make you happy and that are good for you and try to do as many of those things daily.
Live your life for the small excitements. For example:
- Morning Coffee
- Exercise
- Public swimming pool
- Shower
- Skin care
- Sleep
- Reddit memes/videos
- Games
- Movies
There are lots of small things you can do daily that will contribute to your overall happiness.

- Serial numbers will give location of store that bought it. 
- Get records of purchases from that store.
- Visit each customer pretending to be "crypto expert" and let people know that their hard drive could be potentially unsecure.
- Ask them for hard drive to copy
Pretty common scam.
