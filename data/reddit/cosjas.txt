Think about it, if they don't have access to the funds themselves, then why are they going to credit your account? (note: they're not an insurance firm). Am pretty sure they have covered themselves in the T&amp;C for events like this.
@_date: 2012-09-29 09:32:30
That sucks :(
I don't see why it should take so long to get the info from Barclays. Unless Barclays for some reason have just chosen to not cooperate with them at all.
Whatever the case, it never feels good having your money potentially lost in the ether!
@_date: 2012-09-29 11:27:18
It's kind of a stale mate re: the bank stuff. I wouldn't say that the Mt.Gox guys have done anything destructive here. I mean, what else can they do but wait for Barclays to give them their info? As well, they can't credit you when not even they have access to the money.
@_date: 2012-10-15 17:32:21
Sure, yeah, but the least they could do is say, 'guys, we're worried because Barclays don't seem to be responding to us, it's very irregular behaviour and we're not quite sure what's going to happen to your money -- prepare for the worst.'

When i tried to send to a closed account in the past the bank wouldn't even let me send the payment. I'm wondering why I was even allowed to send the money despite the fact that it was closed? Bit worried about that tbh. Guess I can try calling the bank or something..
@_date: 2012-09-30 06:48:20
I agree with everything you've said :)

International bank transfer to Mt.Gox Japanese account. Costs £10 to transfer funds. Takes a few days.
@_date: 2012-09-29 13:03:12
I don't have a smartphone so I can't use PingIt. My bank doesn't do SEPA transfers.
So that means I'm left with finding somebody locally, or mailing actual cash to bitcoinnordic. Things seeming a little fucking dire here lol.
@_date: 2012-10-25 07:33:19
I'm getting fed up with this shit.
@_date: 2012-09-13 16:22:19
You were right. The payment bounced back today :)
@_date: 2012-10-15 17:07:35
Seems like they might have had an inkling that they were never going to receive their monthly statement from Barclays..
@_date: 2012-10-15 12:03:57
Doesn't exactly fill you with confidence does it?
@_date: 2012-10-01 09:24:33
First they said October 1st. Now they're saying mid-October. Beginning not to trust these guys.
@_date: 2012-09-13 20:29:12
According to the intersango site, UK withdrawals are also unavailable. My advice is either wait, or buy coins again, then send them to somewhere like MtGox, sell the coins, then withdraw them there.

I have my GPU running at a constant 98%
I was wondering if there was flag that can be added to reduce the load?
I have tried adding "-f 60 -w 512" but nothing has changed.
I also underclocked my GPU by 30% and that didn't do anything either!
@_date: 2011-05-29 16:48:48
At that speed I would recommend joining a mining pool

The US government trying to shut down bitcoin is like them trying to shut down torrents.
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:27:16
Well I mean for new people browsing the subredddit he gives a nice overview of some of the logical fallacies that are commonly used to attack bitcoin. Some of the metaphors he uses are also helpful too, I think.
@_date: 2011-06-25 16:04:26
@_date: 2011-05-29 00:59:37
Hmm yeah, it is a very interesting way of making money!
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:59:45
If somebody starts their argument with an insult like 'you dullard,' it's a pretty good sign you shouldn't continue debating with them.
@_date: 2011-06-21 17:45:07
Can you explain why he should have said capitalism?
@_date: 2011-05-29 00:22:38
Nice. Have you been able to make many coins? I've been wondering if it's worth it considering the amount of electricity I must be using.
Also, do you use your CPU to mine simultaneously?
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:23:03
Can you please explain why you think it's highly probable? What's the reason and evidence?
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:57:05
Where did you get that picture?
@_date: 2011-05-29 01:43:32
Are you confident that you're going to make a good return on your investment?
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:52:24
I think you mean malevolent

FUCK OFF

Your logo on the top right needs some work. The edges look jagged.

That's very fast. Does the card sound like a hair dryer though when it's at load?
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:19:15
I linked it so that it jumps to that bit. Must have not worked for you.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:51:05
I don't understand why anyone would want to sabotage this new awesome currency like this!!
@_date: 2011-05-29 01:21:06
Managed to get mine to ~360 Mhash/s
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:28:27
I think it's the fact that there's a moral dimension to the word "deserve" that makes me think it isn't really appropriate for this situation.
@_date: 2011-07-07 17:08:47
It's taken 6 hours for me before.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:12:01
I agree. But saying, 'you deserve to get hacked' isn't true. Even if a person were to use the word "password" for all their accounts, they still wouldn't *deserve* to be hacked.
That's like saying, 'people who don't wear seatbelts deserve to die.' Not true!
@_date: 2011-05-29 01:18:26
Fuck. Me.
@_date: 2011-07-17 02:02:28
I would like to see a hit counter on each item page.
@_date: 2011-05-29 00:53:12
Have you been running 3 computers to achieve that?
@_date: 2011-05-28 23:44:11
Ah thanks. I've been trying to get a good mining app. Will try this one out :-)
@_date: 2011-08-09 04:51:49
Who are they to say that Bitcoin is dying? The grandiosity!
And to say as well that Bitcoin is based on *nothing*? Bullshit! Decentralization is Bitcoin's inherent value.

Bitcoin has not failed. People have failed bitcoin.

I am almost certain sure this happened to me last night. My GPU suddenly started going to near 100% usage out of nowhere. I'm pretty sure it's happened before too.
@_date: 2011-07-17 14:49:45
Yeah :)

Why do you think he's not a great philosopher?

Forgive them, for they know not what they do.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:06:00
Thanks! Trying out bitstamp. Hope they don't get their bank account *stamped* out too!

Oh, damn..
