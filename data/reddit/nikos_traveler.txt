At the time, default status was granted on popularity. Of course, new registered users were automatically subbed to the defaults, so this created a huge feedback loop for them. Defaults tended to remain defaults. At some point the admins recognized that defaults weren't necessarily popular just because of sub quality, and quality subs weren't necessarily the most popular. But at the time they seemed to think that it needed a change. 
Going forward they seemed to be more open to just dropping subs from the default list. I think they did that with r/technology and r/politics when they became toxic. And added a few underrated subs.

So we centralize all Bitcoin development under the 21.co umbrella? That doesn't sound good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:43:51
At the time, they didn't directly change the defaults. Or didn't want to, at least. But now the policy is different.

Why does every electronic device need to be mining bitcoins? Turning electricity into heat and money (at a loss) is not an efficient use of electricity, or heat. Bitcoin should be mined by dedicated miners who can mine at a scale that is cost effective. I don't need to mine my own bitcoin anymore than I need to grow my own cotton to weave my own t-shirts.

Haha, right. Clearly the opposite. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 06:11:59
The IDE is interesting, but the mining chip seems superfluous. As has been pointed out ad nauseum, the chip will never mine an appreciable amount of coin, and all revenue comes from the 21.co pool anyway. The IDE could function just as well if it was preloaded with coin, actually better since the credits wouldn't have to be extracted from the pool first, which is an extra step. 
If I was being cynical I would say the main winner here is 21.co. They are offloading obsolete mining chips at a profit while adding to the hashrate of their pool with chips that operate at a loss, subsidized by the user.

Bitcoin doesn't replace a credit card. Credit is spending money you don't have. Blockchain spending implies that you have the money. A credit card transaction is essentially a micro loan.

Right. And if someone ties you to a chair and beats you with a wrench until you give up your private keys, you lose it. But it doesn't take a trip to the sea or a fascist government to do that. Your neighborhood thug does that just fine.

So then, how many nodes on earth do we really need doing validations if the validations don't matter outside of what the miners do themselves? Why bother at all with a full node? You're essentially forced to trust the blocks on the longest chain.

The chip doesn't somehow magically transfer bitcoin to the device. It only generates credits on 21.co's pool, at a very slow rate. It's still on you to move those credits into a wallet of your choosing. You may as well just buy $50 of BTC upfront and use it slowly, rather than wait for these credits to accumulate.

Most economists would tell you that you don't want a currency to 'perform.' Large swings in either direction have negative consequences. And volatility in itself is negative. How do you know what to charge for a loaf of bread today when you don't know what the value of the currency will be tomorrow?
Voorhees seems to be equating Bitcoin with an investment instrument. Which is fine, I guess, if you're in it to make money, but not great if your goal is widespread adoption.

You haven't provided any compelling reasons for why you think fiat will crash within six months. I assume you have none. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 03:01:04
The average block is not full, but they certainly can fill up during peak usage times. The the argument is how best to deal with the overflow. If there was no limit on block sizes a miner could mine some kind of "megablock" and catch up the system more or less instantly. But this massive block could potentially destabilize the system due to propegation delays, causing invalid chains to be created in the short term. Eventually the system would correct itself but there is a risk of double spends and other negative consequences. 
As it is now, during peak usage the system must mine many full blocks in a row to catch up the transactions. This of course can cause a delay in getting confirmations, but there is little risk of system destabilization. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:40:33
That has nothing to do with fiat crashing.

Small chips in first world countries with expensive power will *always* lose money. If people were able to make money with these chips, more would enter the market and drive the difficulty up. The only profitable mining that can be done is in countries with cheap electricity.

A lot of people are complaining about how much worse this sub has gotten. I don't think the sub has changed much. It's a good place to get to know bitcoin as a beginner, and for the more advanced enthusiast it's a good place to keep tabs on some of the larger developments. But there's really very little discussion of things of any consequence that goes on here. The signal to noise ratio is quite low, and the mood of the sub is dictated largely by the direction of the price that day.

The point isn't whether or not these miners will ever turn a profit, we all know that they won't. The point is whether the model itself is predicated on any device needing to mine it's own coins. Miners consuming power at residential rates will *never* be cost effective, users will only be heating their house at a loss. 
If the long term model depends on the devices mining coins themselves, the model has failed. If the model doesn't depend on onboard mining, then why does the 21.co computer have one at all??

Well, logistically it seems easier to steal the bitcoin via brainwallet than gold. To steal $2 million in gold you need to arrange transportation and smuggling across borders and such even after you open the vault or whatever. With BTC in a brain wallet to just hit the guy with a wrench till he tells you the codes.

Well, so far it is all vaporware. Sorry if you you think I'm being disrespectful to whatever "whitepaper" is out there. LN isn't a real thing, and from the looks of it it never will be.
My original point was that this whole thing could have been resolved by now if the discussion wasn't fetishized and/or swept under the carpet by this sub. The irony is that by supressing discussion of the topic this sub has dragged it out (and in a more public manner) than it ever needed to be.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:27:23
This is stupid and helps no one. It does not affect the price, since the merchant will most likely sell the coins, meaning I will be rebuying my own coins essentially. And I lose all chargeback protection vs if I used my credit card, not to mention the 1.5% cashback I would be getting.

Maybe I'm slow, but I don't understand how a full non-mining node helps the system at all. The miners dictate the longest chain. The miners should be validating them. If they aren't then they're fucking up, but there's really nothing that a non-miner can do about that.
What you seem to be saying is that all the non-mining node is providing is a backup copy of the blockchain, should something be invalidated. And more 'good' copies of the blockchain that are out there can help mitigate the aftermath of a sybil attack. But spinning up 6,001 copies of a corrupted blockchain doesn't seem hard to do if you're already intent on attacking the system.
I get the trustless nature of bitcoin, but it seems incredibly inefficient to have to have thousands of copies of a multigigibye database floating around as a somewhat ineffective measure against chain invalidation and attack.
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:36:54

I'm not sure what recourse I would have if my node did not validate a given block when the other 5,999 nodes did. Would my node get to waive its hand in the air and scream "Failed validation!", and if it did, would the other nodes care? If not, then there is some amount of trust in the 'herd' that is essential for the system to move forward.

The top mod was a "laisse faire" kind of mod so there was no QC on the community, which attracted angry 14 year olds who felt oppressed by all religions. It consistently filled the front page with low quality idiotic nonsense with 3000+ upvotes.
The admins basically used a technicality to boot the top mod and installed a puppet mod, allowing reforms on content. is correct that this basically killed the sub, but it wasn't because a rogue mod found their way in.

It didn't go well. In retrospect, this was really the end of Reddit as a libertarian idea and the beginning of Reddit the business.
