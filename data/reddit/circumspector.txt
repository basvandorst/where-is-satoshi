it's not even a penny. It's literally an unusable amount of currency. It's basically a spam ad.
That doesn't mean you have to be a high rolling tipper, but 1 satoshi is like, less than nothing. It's the 5 cent tip instead of the no tip at a restaurant.

On the first MtGox crash back in... may to 400 I shorted at 400. Considering the velocity of the drop I figured we'd blow past 400.
That was an expensive mistake. :)

the list of markets is on the right side. OP listed only two he's seeing and that's because his ports aren't forwarded properly. I fixed it when I had the issue and now I see 79 markets.

I got hit with a similar cryptolocker the other day. Now quite sure what downloaded program it came out of but in any case, I laughed after realizing what it was and promptly reformatted. I keep the irreplacable backed up offline so all this does is cause me annoyance.

Mycelium keeps the pin in plain text on your phone so in case you forget it (like I did) you can dig into the config file and find it again.

Are you still talking about the phone app, because there's a dearth of settings on that thing and I see no "edit fees manually" option.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:55:08
ok, sounds like the issue I first had. They blocked the transfer. Gemini had me wire in the missing amount from another source and reimbursed the fee. After my account wasn't overdrawn anymore, they unlocked it. I think support gave me some ref number to use in the wire, you'll probably have to ask them about that. They've always been pretty fast for me.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:05:34
Gah, the fees seem to adjust on their own too. The lowest I could get yesterday was 9 satoshi, now it's 15! 
Just give me a way to punch in any number I want. It can't be that hard.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:39:21
I'm getting PTSD flashbacks of @_date: 2017-09-08 17:10:35
slightly more granularity would be nice since it's either 0 or 9 for the lowest, but I'll take what I can get.
I like that it calculates the entire transaction's fee and denominates it in USD as well, which I'd like to see on my other wallets.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:05:36
At one point he talks about how btc doesn't need anonymity tech because anything that's ever happened where someone gets tied to their coin and caught wasn't an issue with the protocol but with their related op-sec. To analogize, it sounds like he's saying "cars don't need airbags or seatbelts, there's nothing wrong with the car because it was working fine up until you crashed. The crash wasn't the car's fault; learn to drive better." If I have a myriad ways of leaking identifying information, like my email or my tor server leaking the IP, or chained honeypot access, would not anonymizing features of a cryptocurrency go a long ways to making all of that trivial? He kinda hand-waves that away. 
I agree with the criticism of Monero though. Why hold an anonymous currency when I can just pass BTC through it to wash it of my identity?
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:10:15
Gemini has instant credit. Can't withdraw until the transfer actually clears but you can buy the dip as long as you have an account with one of their banks that allow it. I use Ally.
500 per day limit though, so unless you wanted to buy a whole lot, you'd have to keep it on there ahead of time, which, since it's run by the Winklevoss, I'm willing to take a gamble on them not riding out of town with my money.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:08:42
I'm getting tx's through with &lt;8 sat/b. There's not much more granularity left before we hit a minimum of 1 sat/b unless you suggest we find a way to make the majority of tx's free. As the price of BTC rises, the fees in real dollars will rise. What happens when the minimum nonzero fee is too high for those with incredibly low usd incomes? Only solutions off the top of my head are either feeless tx or using a more local-economy-friendly currency with a low enough valuation that the fees aren't oppressive.

Goddamn, where are the wallet apps with true custom fees? I feel like every wallet I try is missing some rather integral part to full wallet functionality. I just got done trying out electrum only to find the lowest it'll go is 30 s/b
Every wallet is either missing segwit support, custom fee, alt-coin support, varying wallet seeds, awful UI...
Closest I've found so far is my Trezor browser interface which has segwit/altcoins/true custom fee/message signing/good ui but I can't use it on my phone...
I would pay real money for a wallet that wasn't just tolerable.

"something went wrong," could you be more specific?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:24:57
I imagine he means the file holding the exported data is corrupt and assuming he did not write down the recovery passwords to gain access without the file means he's locked out of his money. The bitcoins are fine, he's just lost the key to the safe, so to speak.

Just got my Gemini deposit verified to Bitfinex. Sold them all.
All I'm doing now is knocking myself for not pulling everything to a private wallet before the fork and selling the other half I owned back when it was 600~ instead of leaving it in Gemini's hands. Oh well, free money is free... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:38:19
Alts seem to be dumping as a whole too so it's not just Gemini's BCH, but I'm sure that doesn't help. I'm more willing to believe it's people getting as much in as they can before the fork, hoping for another BCH fork event.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:13:04
I'd like to take a moment and thank younger me for keeping the faith and buying most of my share back when it was around 400~. Nothing life changing since I was kinda poor but it's still fun to see.
Now that I have a big boy job, I've been able to invest "real" money. Now I'm into the realm of moon = retire. Life likes to disappoint so I don't dwell on that dream :P
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:04:12
It's tough to justify buying a lot of things in a brick and mortar store or even on other sites when I can get prime shipping and 25% off if I'm willing to wait a day or two.
