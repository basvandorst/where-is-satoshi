Bitcoins inflation rate is about 4% at present so if Bitcoin handled all of the world's transactions at present we would be paying about 4% of our wealth per annum plus transaction fees to move money.
Of course that will fall as the block reward falls over time.

To be fair he didn't say people needed to know how it works, he said it was far too complicated.
I would interpret this as being it's too complicated to use for mass adoption at present. 
Crypto is getting more user firendly though. Also as more and more people understand how to use it they'll spread that knowledge.

New Bitcoins are coming into existence all the time at a rate of about 4% per year. This is inflation.
If you measure Bitcoin *in relation to*, say the US dollar, then it is going up in value but Bitcoin is still inflating. It's just rising in value faster *in relation to* the US dollar.

Surely if tether is being printed it's because people are using it too much and it's price is rising. New tethers have to be printed to keep it's price stable at $1.

Yes. My point was that u/shiftykitten had probably misunderstood you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:40:59
Yes. The technical term I was looking for was "monetary inflation".
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:15:05
As I've stated elsewhere, technically the term I was looking for was "monetary inflation" and it is a reasonable thing to say as the post I was replying to also referred to "monetary inflation" as "inflation".
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:05:05
That's right. As long as Bitcoin continues to increase in value it is destined to fail. /s
In reality a quick glance at the history of Bitcoin will tell you that it rises and falls all the time. People get shaken out constantly.

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:07:41
So the price of Tether *does* fluctuate with market demand just like any other crypto. The question then is, how does it stay so stable?
Sorry dude, I mean, thanks for the explanation but I just can't wrap my head around the concept of Tether at all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:07:53
Some vendors will hold though and some will pay their suppliers in Bitcoin. This is the only way in which a complete Bitcoin exosystem will develop.

Won't you lose money by paying a transaction fee every time you do this though?

Can someone explain to me how the price of Tether is tied to the US Dollar but it still fluctuates a little compared to the Dollar?
Can't figure it out.

The only reason it's happening is that they can't keep up with demand. Once they hire more staff and expand they'll reopen to new users.
Some exchanges like Bittrex for instance simply can't provide *any* customer service because they're totally swamped. They're concentrating on catering for their existing customers because their reputation has been trashed as they just can't keep up.

People on altcoin subs love to throw around the phrase "better tech".
I've still yet to hear how this "better tech" affects the trade off between speed, tx volume, security and decentralisation or how bitcoin is now "obsolete". It get's said a lot but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it yet.

This is a dumb argument. If Bitcoin goes to 0 tomorrow is what he did ok? I think not.
It's similar to the people who say a guy was dumb for spending 10,000 btc on a pizza but no one's going around saying the guy who *accepted* 10,000 btc for a pizza is a genius.

Do you think bankers deserve their multi million dollar bonuses?
Do you think they can flout the law with impunity?
Do you think they weild too much influence on our political systems?
I personally beleive that while the banking system is a vital piece of infrastructure in a modern economy, it is also extremely corrupt, often in quite subtle ways, and is parasitic in nature.
Bitcoin has a chance to create a new system that cannot be "gamed" by those at the top in the same way as it has no centralised control.

The last time I bought on LBC which was quite a while ago sellers made me write out "My name is ThePowerOfFarts, the date is blah, I am buying x bitcoins for x cash, I am not under duress" and take a picture of me with my passport holding up this sign.
I think a lot of people on there these days take these precautions.
Sorry to hear about this dude. I would contact the police, LBC and your bank but this scam has been going on for quite some time.

Nah, what  he's saying is true. Zebpay has had a flash crash.
Nothing too extreme by crypto standards but it has happened and there's nothing wrong with reporting news even if it isn't good news.

Probably a long dump until it's undervalued then when it recovers and people see it's been rising for a couple of months, that's when the FOMO starts to kick it.

A crash in another currency pair can have a world wide effect.

I'm not quite sure what you're suggesting.
A crash against the rupee can definitely have an effect on BTC/USD prices. People do arbitrage.

Yeah Bitcoin Cash. So *totally* unrelated to Bitcoin. Is it not ok to talk about it here?
I haven't really browsed this sub in a while so I might be a little out of the loop but isn't *this post* talking about Bitcoin Cash?
Is mentioning Bitcoin Cash *only* acceptable if you're slagging it off?
@_date: 2018-06-20 07:58:50
Not really my point.
Is it ok to discuss Bitcoin Cash in this sub? Yes or no?
And if no then why isn't this post removed?

"It sounds so silly but maybe it's not"
When I first became aware of bitcoin, a little while before this video, I thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard of. Learned a lot more about it through reddit and I've been a beleiver for quite some time now.

How the hell does someone spam bitcoin when tx fees are so high?
It doesn't make sense. No one has that much money to waste.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:02:06
If that's what's happening there would be a bit of game theory involved. It'll work best when all pools are spamming the network together but as soon as Pool A stops they'll continue to reap the benefit whilst Pool's B, C and D contribute.
Still sounds a little far fetched to me. I would be more inclined to beleive that the high fees are down to simple demand.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:06:41
Aren't most transactions under 1BTC now?
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:47:32
So mining cartels spam transactions driving up the fees that everyone else has to pay? Short term profit for them but obviously bad for bitcoin long term?
