At the moment only the lower fees, which is actually only a side effect. In the future you will be able to use Schnorr signatures, MAST and many more extensions thanks to Segwit. Also, hardware wallets will have a far easier time using Segwit than non Segwit UTXO.

Actually there is a constant increase in hashrate which yields less than 10min block intervals. Also, there is more than only the block data to transfer, e.g. the transactions, which would yield a significant overhead, even if using Graphene or the like. And this only considers a "leeching" node, i.e. one that does not share its data with other nodes, uploading will increase download bandwidth consumption even more, think ACK packets and protocol overhead.

This is wishful thinking. if miners have zero power why do we not have SegWit, yet and why do we risk of a BU hard fork?


Again, wishful thinking. The only nodes that matter are merchants and exchanges because they "ground" Bitcoin in the real world. Any other node does not matter at all! Unless we replace fiat with Bitcoin, then nodes matter, but not today.

I also think SegWit first is the right way to go. It will take a while for the secondary effects of SegWit to take effect (Lightning networks, Schnorr signatures, ...). In the mean time we can figure out how to scale for bigger blocks in a good way, not BU.
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:31:07
Why? There are other miners in the world. The block time would increase, true, but only until the next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-02-01 11:28:51
Of course, the miner can still chose which tx to accept. Having a greater number of transactions to choose from is certainly an advantage.

I do not think that is quite true. The populous that wants BU is rather loud and aggressive and can easily perceived as a large number when it is in fact not. An overwhelmingy large number of people in the industry and userbase see the advantages of SegWit. The latter even understand that SegWit and BU are not mutually exclusive, something that the typical BU supporter would never admit.
I will post this in and Let's see about the up/down votes.
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:55:57
Well I dont think we have to be too accurate, as we are doing just some coarse estimates and projections into the future. As for CPU performance, lets assume a "up-to-date 2017 CPU". Year over year CPU single core performace does not increase that much. More important is the number of cores and how many threads the client will spawn.

I think CPU usage is vastly underestimated. The other day I did a full sync of the blockchain with a 64core/1TB RAM compute server and it took a full day.
One gigabyte of hard drive space is cheap compared to the one hour of CPU time it takes to process that GB on a typical home computer.
We need numbers here! Can anybody provide real world numbers and a projection for the future?
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:41:08

Hi, you are probably new here. For a scaling solution, 10 times is not that much. There exist a number of other scaling solutions you may want to look into, e. g. Lightning networks. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:07:22
I belive CPU usage comes from verifying signatures. So, number of transactions is a good starting point. How many tx/s can a CPU verify? You could take the time it takes for you to freshly sync your full node. and divide this by the total number of transactions, or as an approximate, by the size of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-01 11:27:44
By all means, this is a great idea!! It would be great to have this integrated in wallets. Maybe even with groups of miners that signal a specific set of options, i.e. SegWit, BU, ...
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:25:53
I think so, too. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:32:24

@_date: 2017-02-08 00:30:09
You forgot Schnorr signatures! Also, I am assumig with "Bi-Directional Payment Channels" you are referring to the Lightning newtworks. You should add "instant transactions" to that bullet point. Something which is just not possible onchain.

Rhetorical trick. What he says is true, no doubt. The way he phrases it makes it look like the problem could have been solved. Given that he is a known strong BU supporter his tweet implicitly advocates the adoption of BU. The trick here is that he tries to relay credibility to his agenda from a fact based truth. And we all know there is more than one scaling solution.
A second trick he is using very often is to leave out or downplay details and to misdirect the audience's attention.
Roger Ver has a long history of twisting facts and should be called Roger "fact twisting" Ver.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:37:11

@_date: 2017-02-17 13:40:35
Then lots of people on yourself included, should be more vocal about this.
In fact I want the same, SegWit plus bigger (not BU, though) blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:51:11
Roger Ver always stated that he is a "SegWit agnostic". This means he knows that SegWit is a good thing but since SegWit stands in the way of his BU plans he must block it, but can do so without publicly saying so. And if BU fails he can claim that he actually never really opposed SegWit.
Additionally, he will claim that he reached his goal by inciting discussing and that blocks are bigger now because of his initiative.
Watch out for Weasel Ver.

Why is a hard fork impossible? With enough hash power BU might fork. Exchanges have announced support. Investors will now have two coins to invest. Why is this impossible? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:59:20


Softforks are the better option, true. However block size increase requires a hard fork.
For the sake of Bitcoin would you/Core be willing to compromise on a 2MB increase plus SegWit activation? Given that transaction growth is exponential, what does a constant factor of 2 matter.
If the hard fork dispute is not resolve it will damage Bitcoin's reputation in the long run.

@_date: 2017-03-27 21:42:53
I am not saying that even if it were true what you say that BU signalling and price are correlated, you may still have causation the wrong way. Your view: BU up -&gt; price up, BU down -&gt; price down. Right? But it is probably the other way round, (BU) miners mine for maximum profit, hence price up -&gt; BU up, price down -&gt; BU down. So, what do you think will happen in case of a hard fork when price is heavily under presure? Right...
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:15:30
To some extent, I think he is right. When it comes to opinions they are inverse mirror images. However, where censors, spreads half truths which is even worse. Also, comments towards unpopular opinions in seem to be more aggressive.

Yes, however, we should provision for future usage. Would you sign up with an Internet service provider that is only able to supply the bandwidth that you currently need on average or one that can supply the bandwidth you need in the future with enough capacity left to cope with spikes?

One thought on the oil industry analogy. While OPEC is fighting over control of the oil price people move away from oil to renewable energy and to driving electric cars. If the fork war goes on people will move to crypto alternatives and in 5 years Bitcoin will be a forgotten experiment.
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:43:25
Yes, of course. However, it depends on your definition of "blocksize". Is a block the thing that the clients check for size or is it the thing that contains all information? To simplify we can assume a block to be the thing that contains all information.
That being said, I agree that we should move to using "transactions throughput", i.e. how many average transactions can be put into a single block. This is relevant as Schnorr signatures will reduce transaction size, meaning more transactions can fit into the same size block. But then again, how large is an average transaction? Consider that Schnorr signatures will be much more efficient on multisig addresses.

Have you tried talking to the BU proponents (Ver, Jihan, not the trolls) in light of recent events, i.e. that a hardfork may actually be happening? They are intelligent beings who very well recognise that huge problems await them. Maybe they are more afraid of a BU hard fork than anyody else, but cannot openly admit this in order not to lose face. This reminds me of the Cuba missile crisis where McNamara suggested that Khrushchev cannot simply withdraw for fear of losing face. Good read on Wikipedia.
With all due respect, you are a brilliant architect and coder, but human interaction may not be your strong suit. The most reasonable decision would be to delegate negotiation to a team member who has the talent and the patience for this.
The BU camp has built momentum over the last few years for many different reasons that we are all too well aware of. Stealing this momentum with a small O(1) concession may be a very smart thing to do. Who knows if such coordinated opposition could ever form again in the future.
Regarding PoW change, I think this is only an interim solution. PoW is inherently bound to form selfish interest groups focused on short term profit. If we cannot migrate away from PoW we need to acknowledge this short term interest, at least to some extent.
Thank you for your time, I would be happy to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to share this with your team members.

Who is this guy? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:08:23
Right. Unfortunately, most nodes do not matter in reality. Only exchanges and merchants matter. If you run a mode and it rejects BU blocks nobody will care. 
The original idea was for Bitcoin to be a decentralised peer to peer payment network, giving nodes the power to validate blocks and keeping miners honest. However, payments mostly happen to exchanges or merchants. Also, it cannot be known how many nodes are artificial, i. e. one person could spawn hundreds of nodes, so voting by node count makes no sense. So, this idea failed.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:12:10
Of course If miners can push HF to BU they can do all kinds of crazy things. Like installing inflation. Or installing a mandatory minimum fee, if a block contains fee less than X, orphan block.
The original idea of nodes validating blocks and keeping miners honest fails in reality. Only economic nodes, i.e. merchants and exchanges, matter and they try to stay neutral.
@_date: 2017-03-30 10:57:24
If we ever get mass adoption, 90% of the users are not intereted in these finer points. They only want a service that works well. Just saying.

@_date: 2017-02-28 19:14:13
As long as there is strong SegWit opposition, many miners will stay neutral and see what will happen. If there was no BU, miners would adopt SegWit much faster. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 09:53:22
You are new to Bitcon, right?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:07:13
I disagree wrt future growth of Bitcoin usage which will likely be exponential. And this does not even account for all IoT use cases. I think the question which is mostly neglected is the question about timing. WHEN do we need blocks of which size?
And BTW spam attacks happen because it is a lot cheaper to spam small blocks than it is to spam larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:34:55
I found this article rather weak. He only talks about mechanics and gets them half wrong. For instance, one chain will have large blocks and near zero fees and the other chain will have small blocks and very high fees due to congestion. Which chain would a profit oriented miner choose?

The real question is what is realistically possible? I wish we could have SegWit three months ago, but here we are. If a compromise helps to avoid open war then I am all for it. Be aware that if it comes to a hostile chain split with BTC and BTU and people trying to actively destroy the "other" chain, things will get really nasty in the sense of Bitcoin (both) will lose maybe 90% value and a lot of long term trust. Good if you want to buy in cheaply, though.

The implications of this are very serious. You may think that Jihan Wu may get sent to jail or similar, however, more likely the Chinese government may use these laws to gain control over him and to gain control over Bitcoin.

Yes, true and we all know it. But the way it looks is that BU is going to hard fork and Core will likely be forced to hard fork, too, for the PoW change defence.

A hard fork is something that must not go wrong, there is no second chance. Software systems are complex and it is extremely hard to find all possible problems in advance. Just try Google for "problems after upgrade". Same goes for the actual upgrade process, if there is the slightest chance of a misunderstanding of for instance the exact point in time for the upgrade you will create forks which would have desatrous effects on the Bitcoin market. The long term effects due to the loss of reputation would be dramatic.
And this is only the technical aspect. Consider, that all nodes in the network must upgrade, which is something that will just not happen. This includes an incredible amount of communication in a large network with so many different participants such as Bitcoin. Real people are lazy and uninformed. You may not see it this way because you belong to the technial elite. If a number of nodes do not accept the new blocks the blockchain will split, again catastrophic effects on the markets.
The only proof for this are my 20 years of experience in the field of software.

And this is not possible in Bitcoin. This is where fundamentalists start making claims that they represent "the community". Again, on both sides.

he talks about the problem of double spends due to latency. The usual 6 confirmations take about one hour! That should be plenty to transmit a 2MB block around the world, please! Remember, we are talking about 2MB blocks, not 4MB, not 8MB, not 1600MB.


And then he talks about scaling solutions like Lightning.
There is nothing in these vids against 2MB blocks. And I am still convinced 2MB blocks bring more good than bad.

There are two ways apps store data, in their data directory and on the filesystem in a data path, e.g. internal memory or sdcard. For instance the Gallery app will store its configuration in its data directory, but all images will go to the internal memory/sdcard. Titanium will only backup app+data directory. Apparently, Breadwallet stores its keys somewhere on the filesystem.

Not a single commentor has answered your question... Yes, SegWit and bigger blocks can be implemented independently from each other and can work together well. My personal opinion is we certainly need SegWit, we may also need bigger blocks. For the latter I am not sure how big blocks should be and if BU is the right choice.

Consider that miner compensation is in Bitcoin, but miners pay their bills in fiat, so compensation largely depends on Bitcoin price.

You could initialise the Trezor with the seed from the software wallet, both wallets would have the same contents that way. However, the whole point in having a hardware wallet is that the private keys/seed never leave the hardware, in contrast to a software wallet. It would be best to simply transfer the coins from the software wallet to the hardware wallet.

This is currently only theoretical, today we are talking about 2MB blocks, orphan risk is not significantly increased over 1MB blocks.


True, but user experience has nothing to do with block size, right?


Not really, funds need to be committed to LN. 2MB blocks do way more good than bad. Again, we are not talking about 8MB blocks, nor 1600MB blocks as some talks suggest. 


I am with you when it's about not empowering miners, I am strongly against Emergent Consensus. However, in regard to the 2MB blocksize increase I do not buy that "the community" is against it. Do you have any numbers to support this claim? The economic majority is strongly in favour of 2x, do they not represent the users?

Trezor said the patch will fix the issue. And apparently if you use a passphrase the attack will not work, probably because all account data is encrypted using the passphrase.

Both are needed IMHO. I think Segwit first in order to get more extensions, e.g. Lightning or Schnorr signatures. Then an increase in block size, question is how big should the blocks be? 2MB? 4MB? 8MB? Unlimited? Dynamic? There needs to be some more discussion about this.
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:45:32

@_date: 2017-08-23 08:01:49
I do share the general intention, buit I have a big problem with this key sentence:


What does that mean "as small as possible"? Technically that could be 300kb block, maybe even 30kB blocks, why not 1kB blocks? "As small as possible" is only a theoretical construct which must be anchored in the real world via a balancing factor. This balancing factor is usability. Blocksize determines fees and has a direct influence on usability. If the block size is too small and fees become too high, Bitcoin will first lose its use as a payment system, and later maybe even its use as a store of value.
The Million BTC question is, what in the real world is "too high", or "too low"? In no debate ever have I seen reasonable, empirically determined numbers! A 0.01$ fee system will collapse once fees are supposed to replace blcok reward. A payment system with 5$ fees is useless, a Lightning base payment system with a 5$ fee might be acceptable. A 100$ fee is way too much for either. Could somebody _please_ fill in some more data points such that we can determine a reasonable fee givin different use cases?
The piont is, for future debate we must switch rethoric from theoretical extremes such as "as high / as low as possible" towards "reasonable" block size / fees.

Here is an idea. Order your deck. Consider the first 16 cards, ignore the other 36 for the moment. Take the first 4 bits of your seed and pick the card corresponding to its number, e.g. 0101, card number 5. Now keep the cards in order and add the next card from the remaining 36. Now you have again 16 cards whose order is fixed and known and 35 cards left. Take the next 4 bits of your seed and choose another of the 16 cards. In total, you can repeat this process 36 times plus one last time where you cannot fill up. This will give you 37 x 4 bits = 148 bits. You could also use 32 cards x 5 bits = 65 bits or 8 cards x 3 bits = 135 bits. Let me know if this was helpful.

"prices driven by trading", read: "prices are prone to manipulation." Not judging, just saying.


This may work for physical commoditites like gold where one needs a certain minimum effort to mine. However, this is not true for Bitcoin, because due to the difficulty adjustment there is virtually no minimum work required, a Raspberry Pi could provide all the hash rate needed to mine new blocks.
"signs of weakness", the only sign of weakness is a low hash rate which could enable 51&amp; attacks. Currently this is not a Bitcoin problem, but a huge problem for many Altcoins, especially Bitcoin forks that share the same hash algorithm.

I can understand the general feeling of Schadenfreude in this thread. However, he was aware of the risk he is taking and took a reasonable approach, even though he misjudged the events to come. I am very much against SegWit2x without support by Core and I am very much against Bitcoin Cash, but I strongly respect this guy, because he put his money where his mouth is.

Actually wallet software should handle fee calculation. However given the fee explosion during the last couple of days due to oscillating hash rate wallet software just cannot do that. tx capacity is too tight at the moment, there just should not be such bursts in fees. I am afraid that SegWit adoption and Schnorr signatures cannot keep up with increase in user adoption.

Absolutely! However in the real world I do not see a problem with 2MB blocks. And as I said this could buy just the time needed for Lightning to take off. Then we could reevaluate. The current situation is just not acceptable. Every major event is clogging the mempool for several days, even without spam.

I believe mempool size and number of transactions are a bad metric as it ignores fee distribution. A better metric would be sat/byte for the top 1MB of transactions, or in other words what fee is needed to have a transaction included in the next block. This can be easily derived from the third graph of joho's memory pool tracker:
It is about 220sat/byte at the time of this writing.

@_date: 2017-11-21 08:57:36
And that is a good thing. However, in the real world it is often not only a question of what is theoretically possible in the long term, but what do we need in the short term. I am convinced that in 5 or 10 years we most certainly will have bigger blocks, so why not increase block size now to get some breathing room today?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:55:51
I believe yesterday tx got to 1000 sat/byte. I do not think this can be caused by a spam attack, only. BTC us currently running at more than half capacity usage. And this shows when there is a drop in hash rate. I doubt that SegWit adoption can compensate for usage increase in the short to medium term. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:06:58
SegWit adoption and Schnorr signatures are outpaced by user adoption. It is a question of timing. We need some more time until Lightning is ready. Only Lightning can solve user demand.

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:26:44
I think we should not fall for using the same rhetoric as the Dunning-Krueger sub. BCH is an altcoin and we are observing foreseeable market behaviour in the sense of capital shift and hash rate distribution.

For the record, this is the full quote:
"I urge Bitcoin Core to adopt a base block size increase on Bitcoin, and they should do it as soon as possible."
I must say I agree to this! During the last several months when hash rate was heavily oscillating between BTC and BCH we could see that BTC is clearly running at more than 50% capacity, even at normal times. I am afraid that SegWit adoption and Schnorr signatures cannot keep up with increase in user adoption. I wish we could have had SegWit2x supported by Core. This could buy us 1-2 years of time until Lightning is finally successfully deployed and adopted.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:54:16
I am not sure that "tried" is the right word. The oscilalting hash power is a foreseeable artefact. It will happen too in the future, but with less strength becaus BCH will get a smoother DAA. Well at least as long as they keep the DAA before they are forced to switch it again when they find it to be buggy.

True, EDA was total garbage. However, BCH forked for an New DAA.

Bitcoin is built on self interest, and that by itself is not a bad thing. However, centralisation, e.g. one miner gaining too much influence, will have catastrophic effects on Bitocoin.

Yes, and we all know this. Of course this would bring the actual "block size" to 4MB. The point is to make a concession to those who also in addition to SegWit want a block size increase more than what SegWit can offer. Calling it "SegWitplusanother2MB" is not catchy.

But how many? There are currently 9500 nodes. Who cares if we lose 200 nodes but gain 800 more in the foreseeable future due to better usability of Bitcoin?
PLEASE, do not use theoretical constructs only, we live in the real world.


Yes, we do and there exists data to prove it. Mid August BCH took away a significant portion of BTC hash rate, increasing block time and thus reducing capacity to about half of what could be expected. As a result fees exploded. This clearly shows that current needs are higher than 50% of current capacity. Yes, SegWit, Schnorr and Lightning will mitigate the problem, but they will each take some time until they are fully adopted by the ecosystem. Currently only ~1% of all transactions are SegWit enabled. Currently a surge in adoption or a mild spam attack can recreate the situation from mid August. The fee system must not be that fragile!

Why do we need to wait until there is an urgent need? Preparing for hardfork takes about one year. If the process starts when we have "urgent need" one year could be devastating.




Why do we need replay protection if everybody uses the new fork? How do you measure consensus? With carful future capacity planning 2x is a no brainer and we should have 100% consensus and do not need replay protection.

Bitcoin has a huge problem and that is the toxic "either you are with us or against us" mentality and a zealot like unwillingness to compromise. People like Vinny who think for themselves and who do not belong to a "camp" will be attacked by both sides.
And yes, Vinny is right, tech is not everything! If tech was everything, Linux would rule the desktop and not Windows nor MacOS. Markets are irrational sometimes. And the demand for cryptocurrencies is a market in which Bitcoin has some very strong competitors. Competitors, that may be technically inferior, but who may ultimately be more successfull for all the nontechnical reasons.

No, today we have 1MB blocks. And you know very well that I mean this plus Segwit. Why are you doing this? This is provocative and very annoying. How could you ever expect to have a reasonable discussion with people when you are nitpicking and sidetracking issues?
I said it before and I will say it again, Roger Ver does a backflip from joy everytime you post, because you drive people right into his arms. Have you ever considered how much it could have been your fault that Segwit was intentionally hugely delayed by the miners and that the BCH shit fork happened?
I still consider you one of the most brilliant minds in Bitcoin but I think in the current situation the statistical expected value of your contributions is negative.

Try the opposite perspective, are bigger blocks so dangerous that we need to avoid them at all cost? Given that the divide in the community is a great danger to the Bitcoin experiment? What is worse, having BCH and SegWit 2x as hostile forks or increasing block size?
[edit: small edits]
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:11:27
Shortly after the BCH fork, BTC was operating at about 50% hash rate, resulting in about 50% capacity. The mempool filled up during that time, not only with spam, but with high sat/byte transactions. This clearly shows that BTC is currently running at &gt;50% of capacity.

I agree partially to what you say. I wish Core would embrace 2MB (plus SegWit) blocks and maintain the code.

This is not specific! How many nodes will fail in a switch from 1MB to 2MB? How many will recover in the future when their hardware/bandwidth situation improves? If there is no quantifiable data then this argument is void and could be used agains 10MB blocks as well as 10kB blocks!

Right. I understand all this. And for the sake of keeping the discussion simple most people refer to what you describe as "base" block when they talk about block size. "1MB" translates to "1MB base block plus SegWit with a total block weight of 4MB". "2MB" translates to "2MB base block plus SegWit with a total block weight of 8MB". Writing "2MB block" is just so much simpler and I think it is obvious what it means  from context.

I thought it is obvious, 2MB PLUS Segwit, so 8MB max block weight, realistically 4MB blocks. SegWit/Schnorr signatures/Lightning will need some time to get adopted, Bitcoin adoption (meaning more tx) will grow during that time as well, so why not double blcok size not to be on the safe side for the next 1-2 years and then reevaluate?

To use the Trezor a wallet needs to be created. I am not sure if Electrum can do this. But I know for sure that if you go to mytrezor.com using Google Chrome you can create walltes there. It may work with other browsers as well, but Chrome is their recommended browser. You may need to install bridge package, just follow th instructions on the web site.
You do not necessarily have to use Tor browser in this case as only the software is loaded from mytrezor.com, the wallet seed is generated partly on the Trezor itself, so nobody can connect your wallet addresses with your IP address.

Is the UASF SegWit the same as the MASF bit-4 SegWit or are there any differences? Will ASICBoost be killed just like with regular SegWit? I am only asking about the SegWit part, I know that the miners will create a 2MB hard fork along with this.
If UASF and MASF SegWit are the same, why do people still insist on a UASF when the miners are going to do it anyway? Is it because of the hard fork to 2MB part? or are there any other reasons? Thanks!

Example, he made a YouTube video calming everybody down that Mt Gox has no liquidity problems. After the Mt Gox crash he made an apology video stating that he never talked about Mt Gox solvency, just about their liquidity.
Another example, read the protocol of his court hearing for a plea deal  when he was selling and shipping illegal fireworks which he was later convicted for. He is constantly trying to use ambiguity to revert what he said later on.

Someone with access to your computer can install a key logger and capture your passwords.
Security is like a chain. If one link is broken the 2hole chain is broken. Just because the one link you are focussing on is not broken does not mean there are other weak links that can be exploited.
Absute security is not possible. Best practice is to prepare for a breach and keep your holdings at different locations using different methods to minimise impact. Hardware wallets being one of the better options. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:40:27
Do not solely rely on hardware wallets, use a paper wallet as well, i.e. write down the seed words and store them safely.
