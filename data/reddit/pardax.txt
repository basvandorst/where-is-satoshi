"new to cryptocurrency" is an understatement. Most dogecoiners can't even basic Math, and haven't even read a basic definition of what the heck cryptography is. They think this is a popularity contest: the funniest meme wins, and trolling every other coin's subreddit will make you rich... somehow.

I have actually understood what it was from the minute I saw it, I don't know why you assume you are smarter than everyone else (I've heard it's usually dumb people who does that). I already knew about the scripting system that Bitcoin had, and that Ethereum wanted to use that idea... in yet another coin, but premined for its founders' profit. So in the end they are just another group of scammers wanting to leech by association to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't have 8 places, it's just a temporary limit. Your balance is digitial, it's just a number in a computer. So it will ALWAYS have more decimals than you can use, doesn't matter where you move the point.
It's like gold. Nobody trades atoms of gold, but the possibility is there. And nobody loses their mind after learning this fact. 1kg = 10hg = 100dag = 1000g = 10000dg = 100000cg, etc. Or 1g = 0.1dag = 0.01hg = 0.001kg, etc.
It's mostly just an American problem, since people use fucked up units there. So they can't make their head around moving the point indefinitely, which is pretty intuitive when instead of feet and sticks you use powers of ten.
1 BTC = 1,000mBTC = 1,000,000uBTC

I wouldn't say that "it's difficult and can take decades". More like it's impossible (without an extraordinary event or thing like Bitcoin) because a) most people are educated by the same system that is enslaving them and b) most people don't even have time to think.
You can't deny the power that controlling all currency gives to the state. Gradually removing that power will certainly be a deciding factor in our path to freedom.
I agree that everyone must be free to debate, but that's not what's happening. What's happening is that corporations and states are using whatever tools they have in hand to attack free speech and the rule of law you talk about. Eg: mass-spying, extortion, parallel construction, armies of paid internet trolls, infiltrators for manifestations, professional lobbyists, etc, etc.
Bitcoin is a miracle and might be the only effective tool we have. It has something very rare that seems completely foreign to previous systems: It has the right incentives. It takes greed and makes something good out of it, for everyone.

Besides, Bitcoin is a world phenomenon. I couldn't care less about the US turning into a police state. I do care, however, about everyone else's money in &lt;insert American company, like Paypal or Google&gt; being seized by US authorities, which happens all the time because they are centralized entities based in that country. Bitcoin protects us from that, now we have a choice. Before Bitcoin, the only option was Paypal.

My browser is recent enough. I don't know why web devs that break websites with privacy-harming features like localStorage assume we don't have recent browsers. It's kind of insulting and seems to be on purpose, especially since you already know I'm not an old fuck with IE6, else I wouldn't know what localStorage is.
Another classic is devs who break sites by tying their logic to tracking software. When you complain, they assume you don't have javascript. Really?
Keep in mind that this doesn't happen often, I normally have a pretty pleasant experience browsing the web. That includes javascript-heavy sites, they work just fine because they know better than requiring new and optional features.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:40:34
You are basically creating your own cryptographic scheme, which is the one thing that you should never do. Use [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( instead. There is a nice js implementation at [passguardian.com]( that can be used offline.
I think the latest version of Armory also has this option.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:54:40
The same security measures you have for banks (and much more), can be used for Bitcoin and you know it. But better say "grr Bitcoin will fail because we still don't have every single feature that was developed for banks over hundreds of years".

It doesn't.


It would be better because you would be in control. You *choose* to use (or not use) this or that private bank. You could even choose to only use banks that can *prove* that they still have your money and that they are not gambling with it.


Why would they take longer? They would take the same or shorter, since they could be offchain.


Of course it won't work for free. But it will be a free market and you will be able to choose the cheapest one if you want to, or just use the raw Bitcoin. Just like some people choose to store their wealth in gold, and secure it manually. With the difference that with enough education, you can actually achieve military grade security for Bitcoin, thanks to the gift of Cryptography that the Universe gave to us.

You don't need to read the code yourself, just make sure you are receiving the same version of the code as everyone else (including the people who can read code). For this you need to understand digital signatures, or have an operating system that deals with this in a friendly manner. Windows does this I think, but I don't know the details (eg: Will it recognize bitaddress' signature? Will it tell you the exact version of the code?). Hardware wallets could also be a solution if you buy them from a certified vendor that you can sue or whatever. Or maybe in the future normal people will just use Bitcoin banks and Bitcoin payment processors.

Deflation is the result of having a currency with more demand than supply. An increase in supply does not necessarily result in deflation. Bitcoin is deflationary.
Of course if you look at the price chart it's not a straight line to the moon, so I guess you could say it has periods of inflation and periods of deflation. But on the long term it's only deflationary.

I assumed you were trolling because no one who understands Bitcoin and is honest would consider Litecoin/Dogecoin or any other copycoin a solution to any problem. Those coins are literally a copy/paste of Bitcoin (or a copy of other copies, eg: Litecoin copied Tenebrix, which was a copy of Bitcoin). Some of them even forgot to change the icons' names when they first launched. You could create your own coin by doing the same if you wanted to, and it would have the same technical value (or lack thereof) as doge.

You can argue all you want, but if you call Bitcoin inflationary you will have this stupid discussion every time, because like I said, when we say inflation/deflation we are talking about the prices of products and services, and indirectly the price of the currency.

The problem is that still requires trust. There is no easy way of generating private keys securely. If a service lets you generate them with dice, how will you know that's what the code is actually doing? Yeah open source, but how will you know someone actually reviewed it? And unless you run a checksum (which you won't do when using javascript), you can't know whether you received the same code that the one others reviewed. And let's say you do everything right... How do you keep 2 of the 3 keys offline, and at the same time be able to spend in a convenient way?

It is definitely about liberty. One does not simply create a centralized currency like e-gold or liberty dollar and avoid being shutdown by the government. We don't have liberty in that regard.
It's also about security, because once you are forced to use one particular fiat currency, you can lose everything (be it in a second or progressively) if the government decides so.
And you can't do anything privately with fiat in its electronic form.

- Invest what you can. $20k is a very good number, and I think this is a very good time to do that. There has been lots of good news in the Bitcoin world, and the market has not caught up yet. The correction after the last jump has already been made, so I would say from here it will definitely go up.

I would avoid bitaddress.org unless you know what you are doing. For instance, did you verify the checksum? Did you get the hash from a separate channel (ie. not the same website)? If you didn't, some day your coins could disappear and it would have been the easiest hack ever. Whoever controls the website even for a few moments (it could very well just be the owner, or just a hacker) could send a few bad copies of the code, and no one would notice it. A few unlucky ones would complain, but everyone else would tell them that bitadress is innocent since it didn't happen to them.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:09:39
Correct. Anything that stores private keys can be considered a wallet, eg: a piece of paper can be a paper wallet, your brain can contain a brain wallet, etc. Trezor is an offline machine that you can use to sign transactions. So it has the security of an encrypted paper wallet, but it's more convenient because it lets you spend by connecting it to another device like a phone or a PC.

I also know many of the ones who didn't have holy days, ended up killing their masters or revolting and participating in battles people still study in history classes.
The system was just adapted to reach a better balance of productivity of the slaves and safety for the masters.

No expert will know how to do that in a secure way. Ways it can go wrong:
- They didn't install any toolbars, but they did install a Bitcoin ticker addon or tray icon.
- Their machine got rooted at some point, antivirus won't help them.
- Physical keylogger. The neighbour planted it when he was invited for a drink.
- Public wifi, MITM. Let's hope your average Venezuelan knows how to detect changes in SSL certificates.
Maybe I should remind you we are talking about *savings* here? The thing people use for buying important stuff like a house? And you want them to "just download some software from github", a website that by the way is only available in English, and trust that everything will be OK.

One good day you will dig a bit more into the technical aspects, and oh I will enjoy seeing your disappointed faces (metaphorically speaking of course). I'm not gonna help you on this one, because I don't give a damn about copycoins that don't add any value to the priceless gift that was given to us by Satoshi.

I don't know what you mean. Why would comparing it to a paper wallet make it ok? A paper wallet is just a private key in a paper, and a lot of people use that to store their wealth. This "simplified" version you are talking about is not good for anything because it's not simplified, it's just bad. I don't know what tigers and lasers have to do with anything, but you either use sound cryptography or you don't.

And second, you know the reward is not the only payment miners get? There are also fees. You have probably paid them many times.

That's pretty obvious, but what the hell can we do if mods don't do shit, and they even run their own scams? The have never **EVER** banned a single troll or removed a trollish comment. For all we know, mods have been bought too (like many mods in many other subreddits). The only solution is to create another sub, but that won't help much IMO.

It has all the good properties from gold that you need in a currency (scarce, fungible, durable, divisible, etc.) but none of the bad ones (gold is difficult to secure, transport, divide, verify its authenticity, etc).


Miners do work that is needed to secure the Bitcoin network. They keep track of the transactions so that people don't spend the same coins twice (an old problem for digital currencies, that wouldn't let them be decentralized). They get paid for that work with the initial 21 million coins (this will end in about 3 decades), and also with the fees from the transactions (which depend on many factors, and some times might be optional).

A government with a lot of money is powerful. One with less money it's less powerful.
A simple example: Every big war (from ancient wars like the ones fought by Romans or Mongols, to the world wars) lasted a lot longer thanks to the governments' ability of creating more money at the expense of devaluing everyone else's.

You could carry the one with little money all the time and plug it in anywhere safely. You could plug it into whatever kind of machine the shop is using for Bitcoin and authorize the transaction, if they support it.

Satoshi had libertarian ideals, just like most of the early adopters, so creating a currency that stops inflation from running amok only makes sense. If it was inflationary there would be no incentive to use it as a reliable store of wealth (which a lot of people all over the world desperately needed, myself included), which is one of its main uses.

The technological singularity is a real thing, and it doesn't take infinite computing power (I don't know where you got that from). It just takes a breakthrough in AI, someone who puts all the pieces together like Satoshi did with Bitcoin. Once you have a somewhat intelligent machine that can create a slightly smarter machine the singularity will come in no time. Other things that were required for this seem to be converging faster and faster. Eg: 3d printing.
From wikipedia: "Stuart Armstrong did a study of artificial generalized intelligence (AGI) predictions by experts and found a wide range of predicted dates, with a median value of 2040"

You have no clue what you are saying. Of course it can't be "the next China", but it certainly can send Bitcoin to the moon. The rich people alone, like businessmen and celebrities, could make the price skyrocket if they jumped in. I don't think it's going to happen though, but for other reasons.

Well played OP. Now all of us are stupid.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:10:25
Turing-completeness is always dangerous. What if the algorithm to validate a transaction never ends? Smart contracts require external data, else they would be useless. What if it requires too much external data? What's the point of distributed consensus anyway if the contract requires information from one particular server? What if the algorithm simply roots your system?
The scripting system from Bitcoin is limited on purpose, but we haven't even been limited by it yet. I would say smart contracts will take a lot more than just adding turing-completeness, which is too ambitious in my opinion. Try to make a basic smart contract work in real life first, with Bitcoin's script.

Well I don't need perfect security for my stupid web app, but I want as much security as I can get for my savings. I think my current scheme is secure enough even when I'm trusting a lot of people (hardware manufacturers, the developers of Armory and the people who reviewed its code, etc.), but it certainly wasn't easy to set up, and an average person simply can't do it.
Now if we are talking about using Bitcoin like a geek for buying coffee, yeah sure, everyone with a phone can do it. But that's not gonna move the price.
Hardware manufactured after say 2013 will become increasingly dangerous for Bitcoin holders in my opinion. I won't feel safe storing a house worth of Bitcoin in a new machine even if I only use it offline.
Someone needs to build some sort of verifiable hardware, with very clear and short open source code for generating private keys.

So why not contribute directly to Bitcoin if they can, instead of wasting efforts in yet another coin that is basically the same thing, just with less hashing power, less adoption, less everything? By now we could already have a fully working p2pool solution, and maybe even zerocoin. Instead, we have another block explorer, another official website, another marketing campaign, another subreddit, another wallets, another everything... just crappier.

Nope. Silk Road had a great presence in the US, and was breaking multiple laws inside its borders. And technically they could have stayed anonymously, they just made some mistakes. You can't compare a normal website like BTC-e to a Tor hidden service like Silk Road. Law enforcement wanted to shut down Silk Road from the beginning but couldn't. Nobody seems to give a damn about BTC-e. Two completely different situations.

It does not. Do you seriously think the most powerful and violent country on Earth would tolerate an *actual* threat?
If you do live in what you could consider a  even remotely brainwashed community like said, consider also the posibility that you are brainwashed too. It's not easy to get out of that, it takes instrospection, courage, education, and to leave your ego behind (nobody wants to accept they have been brainwashed, it's easier to believe others are wrong).


This rock keeps tigers away. Now seriously, think about it. Do you believe it's a good practice to create huge organizations that have the power to assassinate, kidnap, torture, overthrow democracies, bomb weddings, etc., and on top of that let them be not accountable, just because "security"?

So back to the discussion, what's up with all the nay-saying? Why dismiss the concerns of people of the caliber of Gregory Maxwell? Just because "nothing happened" yet? I guess nuclear weapons were never really a danger either, since "nothing happened" during the cold war, right? No offense but again, being a miner and making a living from it doesn't put you above an actual cryptographer that has been involved in Bitcoin for a long time and fully understands everything about it.

The whole point of Bitcoin is that you are in control of your coins, not some centralized service like a website.
If you have more than $1000 in Bitcoin, buy a $200 laptop for cold storage with Armory or Electrum. You install the software, disconnect it from the internet and never go online again. Then you create your offline wallet, print the paper backup that will let you restore it in case of hardware failure, and send your coins there. When you want to spend, all you have to do is create a transaction, put it in a USB pendrive, and sign it with the offline machine. Armory has a very nice GUI for all this.
If you also want to have a digital backup, make sure you don't store it in your online machine and much less in a service like Dropbox, unless you encrypt it.

It's the same as Armory. The difference is that Electrum doesn't download the blockchain, and Armory has more security options like n-of-m schemes.

AOL wasn't a protocol, the comparison doesn't make sense because it doesn't work the same way for companies. Better companies eventually win over bad ones, even if they come later. Better protocols not always win, because adoption is the most important thing. That's why we are still using TCP and SMTP, even though better protocols appeared. Protocols don't need to be the best one, just good enough and the most adopted.

A new subreddit with actual moderation is very much needed. This place is an unmoderated shit hole filled with trolls and paid shills. On top of that, the mods are scammers that ask for donations and then just keep the money for themselves, and secretly make deals with fraudsters like Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:46:49
One last method that will probably be possible soon, is to use multi-signature transactions. You could create a transaction with several different wallet softwares, and your coins would be safe even if some of those wallets are compromised (or even all, if they don't work together).

Oh my god, now you are comparing doge (a coypcoin "created" - or copied - in a Friday night) to the Internet.  Unbelievable.


LOL, is that your new way to attempt to hide that doge is going down on BTC? How pathetic.


lololol classic dogetard, trying to make Bitcoin a "reddit thing", so that their subscribes have some weight. Get some perspective, moron. Most of the Bitcoin world doesn't even know about Reddit, and it's bigger than Reddit. Doge is so small I don't even know why we are even talking about it. Heck, it's even smaller than Peercoin. And you are trying to make people believe that it's taking over, really?
Good luck with those crases, they are exactly what we expected from an inflationary coypcoin. Don't act surprised now.

With Armory or Electrum you only need to backup once, unless your media deteriorates, eg: if the text in your paper backup starts fading away, or if your digital backup is hit by bit rot. So you could have it backed up in different mediums and check/replace them anually or whatever. To do it weekly is insane.

A laptop is just a computer, like your phone, but it's a general purpose one. Whatever you use for Bitcoin could end up being smaller than your pathetic credit card when it becomes specialized. Just like ASICs are smaller than the thousands of computers they replace. But it's understandable that stale and sad minds like yours can't see it coming.
@_date: 2014-03-15 08:34:04
That website is broken for me, apparently they require that you have localStorage enabled, so I can't really see it. It's insane how web developers break such simple pages just to add some javascript effect or whatever. The Armory website does the same. If you are affiliated with them in some way tell them to use graceful degradation (eg: if there isn't localStorage, use cookies).
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:26:20
It's not "a bit safer to use". It's the difference between Bitcoin actually being resistant to violence and being as easy to destroy as anything else. Switching to p2pool (not p2pool.org) is something you do if you care about Bitcoin and the value of your holdings. If you just want to make a quick buck and then get out, use any other pool.

When we talk about inflation and deflation, we talk about the prices of goods and services denominated in such currency, not about the price of the currency (we do that indirectly).
Inflation means higher prices for goods and services, lower price for the currency.
Deflation means lower prices for goods and services, higher price for the currency.

I don't mind having a thousand cryptocurrencies if they add something new.


The thing is doge is redundant. You could have done the same or more with Bitcoin. In fact the Bitcoin community has donated literally millions of dollars to many different humanitarian causes. And sending the Jamaican team wasn't the most humanitarian thing ever if you ask me. If you are honest about it you will admit that dogecoiners did that mostly for publicity, they knew it would make it into the news. It's pure marketing. And even when it worked, they complained about not having enough acknowledgement from that team.
And don't get me started about this "friendly" dogecoin community. A fellow redditor even received threats for exposing a pump and dump scheme that was being organized by dogecoiners on IRC.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:03:01


You don't freaking know that, because you are not a cryptographer. What makes you think that someone finding one piece won't be able to steal the coins? We already have SSS for splitting secrets. Why on Earth would you use a scheme created by yourself or random dude on Reddit instead?

Nobody's gonna come to your house with an aerosol to freeze your ram. They will just take the machines, dvds, etc. and much later they will find out it is encrypted. If you live in a shit country (for human rights) they will then torture you or threat you with prison if you don't handle the keys (USA, UK, etc.).

Splitting a paper wallet - which is simply a private address in a paper - into many pieces has everything to do with Cryptography. You can't just split the private key and hope that an attacker finding one piece will not be able to steal the coins. You have to use cryptographic tools the way they are given to you. There are no "crafty workarounds". You touch the scheme's design, you weaken it or even completely break it.
If we already have a proven solution to this problem, why not use it? Why not use SSS to split your paper wallet, instead of "crafty workarounds"?

Well, you said they fired an RPG to the aircraft, and it's pretty clear that never happened, else the video would have ended right there.
I think no video has been leaked for the drone attack on the wedding yet, sorry. You will have to read about that one.
So where am I going with all this? You, like many other Americans (most redditors are Americans), said they felt nothing about this video. I don't know what you were expecting to see. Blood everywhere? That's the thing about ranged weapons, it's not the same as when soldiers had to use swords, so it's less personal, and even then it can still ruin your soldiers' lives when they start thinking about what they did. For you, as a viewer of a video, it's even less personal. Add a lifetime of propaganda to that, and you end up with Americans that can watch this video and feel nothing. For example, most Americans I talked to didn't even know there were such thing as international laws, and that countries were supposed to declare war before invading. So there isn't even a baseline we can assume to start a dialogue. The militarization of a country starts in the school. Geography is a very important subject in that respect. It is no coincidence that lots of Americans don't know where other countries are located, or how to write their names. During the Olympics, there were screenshots of TV news programs like the BBC around the internet, where they showed some scores or results, and all the countries had flags that didn't match. You just can't make that up, and it happened many times in other news. I remember once seeing some news about Argentina, and they showed a map of America (the continent) with an arrow pointing at Bolivia. There are countless examples of this, I also notice it in American tourists. This can't happen by chance.
It's tempting to blame you (eg: "you should have seen through the propaganda"), just like you are tempted to blame the middle-easterns (eg: "he shouldn't have pointed his camera to the aircraft"). But the truth probably is that you are also a victim. Of course some victims have it worse than others, but we are all part of the same broken system. So we should fight for humanity, not for imaginary borders, or for whoever is in power of the country we happened to be born in.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:14:16
You are mixing up two things: confirmation times and transactions per second.
The network is capped at 7 TPS *in the code*, and that limitation can be removed easily. I think they are just waiting until they figure out some performance issues, like the right block size.
Confirmations are for security. If you want to use Bitcoin directly to buy a soda, you simply don't wait for any confirmations. That's called a zero confirmation transaction, and is what you use for small purchases. Altcoins claim to be better because they have 5 min, or 2 min, or 1 min confirmation transactions, but that doesn't really solve anything. Remember that the confirmation time is an average, so the 1 min confirmation coin could take 3 mins. There is no way in hell I'm going to wait 3 mins in the store after buying my soda. If I'm buying a house though, I have no problem in waiting for 10 confirmations of 10 minutes each, and since Bitcoin offers the most secure network, that's what I'm going to use.
But remember that there will also be payment processors built on top of Bitcoin, just like Visa is built on top of the USD. That will ease things, offer buyer protection, and also offload some work from the blockchain.

You also have to micro-manage the first transaction though, because if it uses old coins its priority will be higher than normal and can make into the blockchain without any fees.
But this attack can be easily prevented with better wallet software. Eg: It would be trivial to add an "expected confirmation time" indicator for transactions. The merchant could set it to show a warning in red or whatever if the expected time is much more than ~10 minutes.

After what was supposed to be the last coin mined as reward, the dogecoin network will continue to reward 10k doge per block forever, which at 1 block per minute is ~5% anually of the 100 billions that was supposed to be the max amount of doge. It ended up that way by mistake, they didn't know how to fix it and left it there. Now they can't fix it without a hard fork in the blockchain, and are not sure if they want to do that (some people are even in favor of inflation, claiming they are economists or whatever).

At higher prices other things happen too, including but not limited to more hashing power being added to the network, as mining becomes more profitable, making the network more secure, reducing the risk, and increasing its utility as store of wealth even further.

To sum up, now hackers will be able to hack even your cold storage machine, because these Ethereum "geniuses" decided turing-complete transactions are better. As typical copycoiners do, they claim Satoshi "missed" something, when in reality he purposely made the Bitcoin's script turing-incomplete.

Everyone has "great" ideas of what I could have done, like "oh you could have just travelled to any other country" (which I obviously can't, and what's the point anyway if I can't take my money with me), but they don't know the whole picture. In my country, electronics are way more expensive than they should be, because they want to help "local industries" (which are non-existent, and all this is just a way for politicians to steal money). So yes, I could have risked all my money to buy some overpriced GPUs. But working on a way out of this shithole looked like a much better idea. The only machine I had, I couldn't risk burning it by mining and lose my livelihood. I honestly believed Bitcoin would go to the moon, I just didn't expect it to happen so fast since it was not easy at all to secure your coins yet for non-technical users. It seems like I was right on that last part, seeing how many people have lost their coins to hackers. IMO too many people who shouldn't have jumped into Bitcoin yet did it anyway, taking more risk than they thought they were taking. Some were lucky and didn't get hacked, some others got hacked as expected.

@_date: 2014-03-03 16:30:23
No it doesn't. See: Mt.Gox.
What it does is it allows for a bank or exchange to *prove* that they are not running a dishonest fractional reserve. But it's their choice whether to do that, and it's our choice whether to use their services. If given the choice, you should always pick banks/exchanges that choose to be transparent.

The old system (banks, governments, regulators, etc) are a pain in the ass for digital currencies. Exchanges like gox run into lots of issues because of this, especially in the US. Usually banks only let them send a fixed amount of money per period, so if they already exceeded the limit imposed to them this month, you will have to wait until the next month, and so on.

Just invest and hold. And when you need to buy something, pay with Bitcoin and then refill your wallet with new coins. This way your stale money gains value over time instead of losing value like it happens with fiat (government-issued currencies).

The whole point of Bitcoin is that you are in control of your coins, not some centralized service like a website.
If you have more than $1000 in Bitcoin, buy a $200 laptop for cold storage with Armory or Electrum. You install the software, disconnect it from the internet and never go online again. Then you create your offline wallet, print the paper backup that will let you restore it in case of hardware failure, and send your coins there. When you want to spend, all you have to do is create a transaction, put it in a USB pendrive, and sign it with the offline machine. Armory has a very nice GUI for all this.
If you also want to have a digital backup, make sure you don't store it in your online machine and much less in a service like Dropbox, unless you encrypt it.

I don't know about "the Illuminati" or that kind of thing, but I do ~~believe~~ know that governments of the world are manipulated by more powerful entities: mega companies like [BP plc]( (take a look at the "history" section and you will find things like the Operation Ajax). They control governments through bribery, extortion, violence, etc. They make them overthrow presidents, invade countries, or anything they need to happen. And sometimes governments even decide to benefit such companies without any kind of pressure, eg: People in the government who own stock in such companies will want to benefit or harm them?
The incentives in the current system are just wrong. It only benefits the people at the top.

Turing-completeness is not a feature that Bitcoin "lacks". It was avoided *on purpose* by Satoshi. So far Ethereum is just a promise, and I won't hold my breath. One does not simply create a *secure* turing-complete script, if it's going to be ran blindly even in offline machines. Do you really want to run on your air-gapped machine code created by random strangers? I'm not talking about Ethereum's code, I'm talking about the transaction code for "smart contracts" that everyone will be able to write and run on your machine. With who knows how much money as reward, the sandbox won't hold and hackers will break out of it in no time. It's the most stupid idea ever IMO, but we'll see how it develops.

It's 10k coins per block forever, so yes if no coins are lost it will go down a little as percentage of the total circulating.

BTC is anonymous just like reddit is anonymous. People prefer to call it "pseudonymous" because all your transactions (like all your comments) are linked (unless you use Stealth Address). Of course you can always voluntarily identify yourself and stop being anonymous, like with any other anonymous thing.
You can erase your trail using exchanges, but I would use at least 2 (send LTC from one to the other to make sure you get different BTC). This can be good for privacy in some situations, but keep in mind that the exchanges will still know you, and someone (like a hacker or law enforcement) gaining access to their databases could identify you.

Why bother using the wheel? We already have feet and also horses!
@_date: 2014-03-16 08:06:59
For about two years I didn't have a horse in the race even though I fully believed in Bitcoin, because I wasn't able to send money out of my country. Which is precisely one of the problems Bitcoin solves, so yeah, I could have many times my current wealth, but someone had to take the hit right? Else there wouldn't be a reason for Bitcoin to exist in the first place. So I preached about Bitcoin, taught people about it (I happened to have the skills required to fully understand Bitcoin), and then one day on 2013 I finally found a great way to get my first coins, so here I am, I became a Spartan and started to hold like everyone else.
I love Bitcoin just like I love 3d printing and other revolutionary technologies that will change the world but which I don't/can't profit from. I would say I'm more interested in Bitcoin than in anything else because becoming rich has been one of my goals (not like people who say they want to be rich and don't try anything. I tried everything and continue to do so), and suddenly it's a very real possibility. But I would be very interested in it anyway, even if there was no financial reward.


It's not impractical, it's a fantastic new protocol with, understandably, an inmature ecosystem. Eg: what did the internet feel like on its first years? Let me tell you: it was a piece of shit. Only high level nerds could use it and see its potential. And what about the web? Same thing.
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:35:09
Block reward has nothing to do with this. It's self-regulating because when there is more demand, the price goes up, the hashing power goes up, the security goes up, and the difficulty goes up (which stops more miners from joining). When there is less demand, the opposite happens. So the free market regulates all of this.

No I don't like the idea. The stupidity of using turing-complete scripts is discussed in this same thread, in other comment.

But Satoshi made Bitcoin's script turing-incomplete on purpose, not because he lacked something.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:43:56
You are not supposed to reuse Bitcoin addresses. That's why Bitcoin-qt, created by Satoshi, won't send the remaining coins back to the paper wallet. Instead it sends them to a change address. So you need to create a new paper wallet and send them there (or send them again to the old wallet, but that's bad).

People's money has been seized over and over again by the US not for crimes, but just because they can, and people can't do shit about it. Just like big companies many times screw people just because they know they are not gonna fight it in court.
Say you have a tech startup that makes games or whatever and sells them online. You use Paypal because there is no other option. Suddenly you hit the jackpot with one of your projects and people start buying like hot cakes. A lot of money starts flowing through your Paypal account, and it triggers the "money laundering" alarm. Aaaaand it's gone! Your account gets frozen, and later the US takes all your money for no reason. Google a bit and you will see that this has happened thousands of times to legit merchants all over the world. The same also happens at customs every day. Someone made a mistake in some stupid form (of the thousands they have to fill), and all his money is taken away because "terrorism". Suddenly his life savings are gone and his dreams are shattered.

They get to negotiate. Depending on how long are users are willing to wait for their transaction to make it into a block, they can pay more or less (or nothing). And miners can choose to add transactions to the blocks they found, depending on how much they are willing to work for. That's the same way it works for chocolate or any other thing (you buy it or you don't). Nobody goes to the store and starts negotiating prices with the merchant.

Saying that PoW is a "waste" of energy is something typically done by people who don't understand PoW, people who want to hate on Bitcoin for whatever reason, and shitcoiners who want to push their coins based on insecure "alternatives" like PoS. And typically they also talk about the need for a "hard fork" in the same paragraph, as if that was part of the problem. They do that intentionally. I'm not saying you did, but apparently it's contagious.
If you honestly believe something better can be built, go ahead and do it. Don't waste time thinking about hard forks. Making good changes to Bitcoin is easy.
I'm sorry it, just seems crazy to me that people are considering the creation of something better than what Satoshi created, and in the same paragraph they worry about or explain how the switch could be made to Bitcoin. It's like saying "Yeah I think airplanes are wasteful. We should create a plane that instead of fossil fuel, uses the power of our minds. I wonder how we could convince airline companies to start using these. I think I could talk to some CEOs, but it will take some work."

I know one guy for whom it seemed to "click" (but actually it didn't), because he mined and everything, he was excited. But then he lost confidence because he thought Satoshi could come back and start controlling the network (because magic), and there was no way to explain him anything, because he was convinced he knew everything there is to know about Bitcoin ("I mined it, bro").

These words are the "seed", and they are used to generate the private keys in a deterministic (repeatable) way, so yes, it's the same as backing up the private keys (actually it's better, because you only need to back the seed up once, and then you are safe forever).

The MIT/X11 license is one of the most permissive open source licenses. It's a piece of text you attach to the code to let people know what they are allowed to do with it. It's necessary because by default only the author has rights over the code, so most devs and companies won't normally dare use unlicensed code.
I don't think Satoshi used because of the institute. He used it because it was the best license for it.

It's not specific to Bitcoin, but it's not always in the form of "hate a technology", sometimes they want to protect one, like the [hydraulic fracking shills](
So yeah, it happens everywhere. And it's nothing new. I remember a documentary about lead, and how bad it was for the body in kids and also long term. The gasoline industry hired renowned scientists to shill for them, and go as expert witness to convince the US senate of not prohibiting leaded gasoline. They trolled hard the other scientist who was trying to save everyone, treated him as a conspiracy nut, and they managed to delay the prohibition many decades.

Normally I wouldn't check any sites that require linking fb or twitter, but sucks so much that I'm willing to do it.
Edit: Spoke too soon: "Sorry!  You must have at least 20 Twitter followers to sign up for ZapChain with Twitter". I guess Zapchain is only for CEOs, 15 y/o girls, and people who don't mind giving up on their anonymity. The solution to shit posts and trolls is having moderators that don't suck, not forcing people to use real IDs.

I can try. First you need to prepare your wallet and watch-only copy:
1. Install Armory in your cheap machine, and never again connect it to the internet.
2. Create a new wallet there
3. Create a paper backup of that wallet and check that it works (delete the wallet, and try to recover it with the paper backup)
4. Create a watch-only copy of the same wallet, save it into a pendrive, and import that copy in the online machine.
So now you have the actual wallet in the offline computer, and a watch-only copy in your everyday, online computer. The watch-only copy is for convenience, it lets you generate addresses to receive bitcoins, and see the balance, but it doesn't let you spend the coins.
When you need to spend or move coins around (eg: to refill your petty cash wallet, which you could have in your everyday computer), you generate an unsigned transaction in your online computer, save it into the pendrive, move it to the offline computer, sign the transaction with the actual wallet, and move the signed transaction to the online computer to be broadcasted to the bitcoin network.
Hope this helps.

Yes, bits get changed randomly through hardware failure or cosmic radiation.
No it's not a reliable fix. I'm not so sure about the solution, but you could probably have hardware that is made for that, or use some sort of scheme of error checking in the software level: keep the file and a hash of that file called checksum (eg: you can use md5 or sha1, which are algorithms for fast hashing), and have many copies. Periodically check the files' integrity by rehashing them and comparing to the hash you have stored. If one of them fails (even a single bit changed will give a completely different result when hashed), you delete that copy and make it again (from one of the other copies you have). Cloud services for backup probably do this kind of thing automatically, just remember not to store anything unencrypted in the cloud, and not to rely only on the cloud, always have a local copy.

If you think there should be a new trashcoin for every feature we can come up with instead of improving Bitcoin, then why not buy PPC/NVC/XPM too then?


Same as above, all the crapcoins have room to grow. And Litecoin is accepted exactly in the same places than the rest, if not less. There are other coins with a much better marketplace integration and marketing. Check out Feathercoin.


You should buy some Infinitecoin then.


Are you serious? I'm not even going to answer to this.


Satoshi has put a lot of thought into this. Randomly changing variables and re-branding with a new name won't improve a thing.

In the link we can see Coinbase being shown as an example of a company that is using the tracking techniques. Which for the normal user means Coinbase will know who he is and everything he has done on the internet even before the user signs up. On other websites using similar techniques or services, there have been stories about people receiving a marketing email trying to retain them as soon as they closed the page (just by visiting their site they already know your email).
All of which is obviously a huge privacy violation, which is illegal in many countries. That's why European websites sometimes annoy you asking for your consent before storing cookies in your browser. But there are many other techniques used for tracking. Check [this]( out.
In reply to Olaf: I know what a fingerprint is, and what it can be used for. I know lying to us is your job, but your company got caught red handed, so there is nothing you can do here. There is absolutely no reason for your company to be using fingerprinting, other than gathering information that they weren't given permission to collect, either for marketing purposes or for selling it to the government, like every other company in the US does. We are tired of hearing "we care about your privacy", like Microsoft et all kept saying, when it's absolute bullshit and there is massive evidence against them.

Avoid brain wallets and web wallets.
Learn about cold storage, that's what you use for your savings in Bitcoin. Desktop wallets that implement this are Armory and Electrum. Another option is to use a hardware wallet like Trezor, which should be completely safe from viruses and hackers.

I agree with agentcash, but be careful with the addresses you send or receive though. For example, I have seen lots of sites accepting Bitcoin, showing their addresses in insecure pages. A hacker could change that address before you receive it in your browser, and you would end up sending your coins to the hacker.

@_date: 2013-11-03 09:18:06
Right, I mean, a block can be invalid on its own (eg: badly formed, or with an invalid signature), or it can just belong to a chain that turns out to be not the longest one, which is called a fork and happens all the time (for example when multiple brainwallet crackers try to spend the same coins at the same time). Nodes continue to accept and relay those (the well formed ones) until certain point I guess, maybe based on the timestamps or in the block index number (they were just using hardcoded checkpoints last time I checked). But you are right on that each node maintains its own version of the chain(s), they just don't get to make one longer by creating and broadcasting valid new blocks like miners do.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:46:26

What kind of question is this? Of course not.
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:17:09
Miners try to find blocks using their computational power, and when they find one they add lots of transactions in it. The block is then added to the blockchain, and we say those transactions have now 1 confirmation (the more confirmations a transaction has, the more sure you are it won't be rolled back for being fake or whatever). We are supposed to see 1 block mined every 10 minutes in average. For this work, miners are awarded certain amount of coins, and they can also claim all the fees from the transactions they included in the block.

Through mtgox, yes. While they were $4-$16, I lurked local forums to see if I could buy some coins since wire transfers are not allowed in my country. I was disappointed to see I could only buy 20-30 per transaction, nobody had more than that (they were all GPU miners), so I didn't bother. Now I can buy via internet, but it's too late :S. The one thing that gives me solace is that we wouldn't need Bitcoin if it weren't for these issues. So I'll have to settle for being just a millonaire when Bitcoin realizes its full potential, instead of a billionaire. Bitcoin world problems.

When the network receives a transaction that has input &gt; output, it just adds the difference to the fee. I think this allows for smaller transactions (in bytes) since you can skip the fee part and let it deduce it from input - output. I guess a different solution that prevents these problems could have been to simply reject the transaction at the protocol level when there isn't an explicit fee, but I'm no Satoshi so I don't know.

Memes are not information, as in "what's the formula of relativity" or "how to cure cancer". Some of them are art pieces (eg: the trollface), and you are hurting the soul of their creators. Even if you wanted to give them a cut, they still have the right to say "Sorry, I don't like this to be commercialized. I created it to be funny and shared for free on the internet".

They will have to even out on many things before they even out in price. For example, in btc-e.com the problem is getting money in, not out, and therefore the prices are always way lower. But yes, that's how it works, and theoretically they all will eventually even out.

Your client sends transaction to the other clients it's connected to. It's a peer-to-peer network. If the transactions seem to be valid, those clients will relay them to other clients, and so on. Eventually, miners learn about these transactions and might decide to add them to the next block they mine. When a transaction is added to a block, we say it has 1 confirmation.


If you try to spend the same coins twice by creating two transactions with the same inputs, one of those transactions will end up being added to a block and become part of the blockchain, the other one will be discarded (or added to a block that will later become invalid. This is called a fork), based on priorities defined in the protocol, like the size in bytes, the fee, etc. That's why you should wait to have some confirmations before you give something in exchange for Bitcoins.

Inflated or not it's still in the equation, and it's affecting the market: people are willing to buy/sell Bitcoin at that price.
For example, at localbitcoins you can get "inflated" prices too, because for the seller it can be an annoyance, so he might want to sell higher to make up for the inconvenient. There can also be scarcity, like when a country has banned all the other currencies and it's difficult to get Bitcoin inside. People don't mind buying because it's still way better than staying full fiat. It's the free market at play, we shouldn't remove that. We should just use a *weighted average*, which is an average but taking into account the volume (eg: prices with more volume will weight more in the resulting average). Bitcoin average is probably already doing that.

Again, no explanation, and your only argument is which price you bought at. Let me tell you a little secret: I bought Litecoin at ~$1 and Infinitecoin at 1 Satoshi. Poor me right?

Big pools like BTC Guild = centralization. Everyone joins them because it's more $ in the short term. I tell them "don't! Join p2pool instead". No one listens. One day, when Bitcoin is a lot bigger, this centralization will be the end of Bitcoin, due to easy DDOS's that can fuck up the network for an entire day, making merchants lose money and, with that, their faith in Bitcoin.

Anything can happen in windows. For example, Outlook used to have a scripting language if I remember correctly. So an attacker could embed a script in the email which would be executed as soon as you opened it. It has probably been fixed already, but you get the idea.
I don't think viruses work that way anymore, so technically you could safely open any emails. I have actually opened the cryptolocker email and there weren't any scripts in it (I opened it from Linux though). So you have to open the attachment to get infected.

I have to agree with this describes 50% of the Bitcoin ecosystem very well. Unregulated banks / exchanges everywhere, and people is too naive and/or ignorant of the law (this wouldn't happen with a traditional local bank, at least not with a non fully corrupt government) and technology (this wouldn't happen with cold storage) to realize just how risky it is to give all your money to a random website.

Bitcoin is meant to be sound money, not a digital Robin Hood. It will still help the poor for many reasons though. Eg: It rewards saving instead of punishing it through the invisible tax called inflation.

It's not trying to identify you either, which I would say is the necessary condition. Cash doesn't try to keep you anonymous either, eg: It doesn't have a built-in system for removing your fingerprints or DNA from the paper.
But still, privacy is not very clear in the design of Bitcoin. For instance, why did Satoshi add "change addresses"? It was to improve privacy, but at the same time he did not bother creating something like zerocoin. So what was he thinking?

Maybe because it's a well known fact that the government spends a big deal of money in marketing and shills? There are paid bloggers doing this all over the internet, and Argentina isn't the only or the first one to do this.

I love how random altcoin speculators think they understand cryptocurrencies, but they don't, and you are the living proof of it.
Have you not read what OP said? Litecoin offers no real advantage over Bitcoin. You think faster confirmations are better because you don't understand what they are for in the first place.
Besides, I have yet to meet a Bitcoiner who isn't interested in Zerocoin, a coin which, unlike Litecoin or Vaginacoin, might bring some very useful innovations. So you are just wrong about everything.

I think bringing the subject to other subreddits is good, but we have to be careful not to look spammy, and try to fit the different subreddits' formats.
In this case, I made a rage comic where a guy invests in Bitcoin and it goes wrong because the price goes down, so he rages (fitting the ragenovel subrredit's format). I think it's good even if it didn't end well for the ficticious character. The next time they hear about Bitcoin, they will probably say "Alright why is everybody talking about this? I'll check it out for myself".
In other words: Any advertising that is not a lie (eg: I'm not saying it's a scam) is good IMO.
@_date: 2013-05-14 02:01:09
They accept BTC, they are cheap, they have lots of countries to choose IPs from, they let you use any protocol you want (eg: OpenVPN).
The only bad things are that they are based in the US, and their employees don't even know how to use PGP so you can't send secure emails to them. I would much rather use something based in Switzerland or Netherlands. For all we know they could be giving access to the FBI/CIA/NSA/etc, just like Google, Facebook, and many others do.

You mean with the mixers? Those are services that receive coins from many individuals, mix them, and then give each person coins from others. Say you send 5 BTC that everyone knows you own. You will receive 0.1 BTC (or whatever) x 50, from 50 different persons, and end up with a new address with a total of 5 BTC that nobody knows who's the owner.

That makes no sense. How is Bitcoin less virtual than WoW gold? You didn't explain that. Sure, Bitcoin is better in every aspect. But the virtual aspect remains unchanged. Believe it or not WoW gold has certain impact in the real world. For example, before Bitcoin existed, that's what ransomware used. To pay the ransom you had to enter WoW, buy gold, meet with another character inside the game and give it to him. He would later change that gold for USD somehow.

Do you know cryptsy? There are at least 50 coins being traded there. Litecoin is just another one that didn't quite work, because there was nothing special about it. It's only used for pumps and dumps, that's why there are no services and is accepted nowhere. Only in exchanges.

Chargebacks are not as common as you might think. Wikipedia says it's mostly a US and Australia-only thing. In other countries you need a premium card, or it simply doesn't exist. And you need to answer lots of questions and have an investigation. In the US, credit card companies decided it was cheaper to just let everyone issue chargebacks and skip the investigation part altogether.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:17:07
I think you should evaluate various things if you haven't already (the cost of a cheap notebook, the cost of building the Trezor, the perceived value of a Trezor, etc.) to decide how much wealth (I'll call it that to avoid confusions) people should give you in exchange for a Trezor, and keep it the same over time (unless the situation changes), and then decrease it periodically as you have a more steady influx of wealth and building the Trezor becomes cheaper.
I understand that initially you were/are taking all the risk (except for the pre-orders, which mitigate this), and your first buyers should be early adopters that are willing to pay more. What doesn't make sense is that the market price of Bitcoin doubles and you do nothing about it. I don't think those who have orders pending would be upset about you lowering the price, unless they paid *after* the last jump. Eg:
- If someone paid 1 BTC when it was $100 and is still waiting for his Trezor, and now you lower it to 0.5 BTC due to the x2 jump, he shouldn't feel bad and he shouldn't complain, that's how a pre-order and a deflationary currency works.
- If someone paid 1 BTC now that it's $200, and a day later you make a special offer or lower the price permanently and he complains, maybe you could handle this issue in a private manner (let him get the special offer, or at least *something*) so that everyone else don't do the same, and you still keep everyone happy. This kind of thing matters a lot, but you will probably only notice it when you have more competition.
If you see websites that aren't updating their prices in BTC, it's because they left that part of the site or business (or the entire thing) unattended. Active merchants do update their prices in BTC, they don't expect to earn x2 the wealth from this.

Anything can correlate to a wallet. All you need is an algorithm that for the same input always returns the same private key.

That's what is called a point of failure. It doesn't matter if it has an easy fix. It's still a point of failure, and will be enough to make any attack 2 or more times easier. From one moment to another, lots of merchants could lose a lot of money, and kill faith in Bitcoin forever. But you guys keep telling everyone that "it's ok" to have almost 50% of the hashing power in a single mining pool. Miners can switch and fix their problem. But guess who can't stop business an entire day and even take losses on unpaid merchandise they delivered? Merchants. All the hard work of educating people and making merchants start accepting Bitcoin will have been in vane. And all because of overly greedy and irresponsible miners, and people like you who just don't want to hear any negative information.

It's remarkable that you don't understand that other countries have their own cultures, music to listen to, and topics to care about.
For instance, think about this: Not every country has black people. I have never talked with a black person. And people who study English don't necessarily understand what a "brother/sister" or the "hood" is. Nobody cares about those topics. 
Also, the musical value (I don't really know if it has any) of the "rap" genre isn't obvious to the average person. So why would anyone listen to it? Let alone know the name or nickname of some US rap artist.
On the other hand, genres like normal "pop", "dance", "rock" or "metal" (and its subgenres) made their way into certain subgroups in probably every big city. Their value is much more evident, and the topics are transversal to lots of cultures.
Bon Jovi, Madonna, etc, unlike you, have travelled all over the world, talked a bit in each different language, and became well known over the years, singing about bullet-proof topics like love, passion, etc. Becoming known also takes time, that's why older artists can have more fame.

In Spanish you can pronounce any word, just by knowing the sound of each letter of the alphabet and certain rules.

Those values are such only if you think in today's Bitcoin price, obviously. People are telling you the price of a Trezor is expensive *today*. The price just doubled and you didn't adjust it a bit. Instead you claim that since it's used to secure Bitcoins, its nominal price in Bitcoin should stay the same (nonsense). Do you seriously think you will double your revenue like that?

I only started dealing with money a few years ago, and only there I realized just how shitty the country was. But it was also kind of like an intensive course on how the world really works, and we get this super power to predict what will happen in other countries on which the governments weren't so free to fuck people over, so they kind of lag behind us in that sense, and to us is just history, we have already seen it. Any time something happens in the US, ask an Argentinian living in the US and he will probably tell you "I have already seen this movie and you are not gonna like how it ends". They treat us like the comparison was retarded, but it is right every time.
In matter of savings, obviously nobody saves in "pesos". Everyone used dollars, but since 2011 that has been forbidden by the government (along with gold and any other thing they could think of), who just keeps on stealing from the people. I have no idea what literate people is doing, personally I have quit my job since I couldn't do anything with the money (saving/investing was not possible) and started working in personal projects (I have money to live many years and am not in debt). Illiterate or brainwashed people just keeps on believing in the government. The poor are easily manipulable, but there are also educated people who has been brainwashed and says the current government is the best we ever had (it's actually the worst), I still don't know how that works, it's pretty impressive.
But there are some things that we can use to our advantage. For instance, I have managed to buy bitcoins with my credit card (through some obscure route that I don't wanna share), and be charged with the official exchange rate (1 dollar = 5 pesos) +15%. If I wanted to sell those bitcoins now, I could sell them with the real exchange rate (1 dollar = 10 pesos), which is the one everyone accepts. So the government is paying for the difference, and it's kind of like I was getting back part of what they have stolen from me or others. I have also payed for years in advance of offshore VPN, email, hosting, and other tech things I always need (I'm a developer).

To the question in your post: Yes, blockchain.info is safer.
To the question in the title: The best place is your own cold storage. Right now the easiest option is Electrum. But keep an eye on Armory which is about to get a major update, and it's gonna kick ass.
Or just create a cold storage paper wallet with blockchain.info, but it won't be as safe as the other options, since they had access to your private key for a few moments, even if we trust them when they say they deleted it after you printed it. And it won't be very convenient when you want to spend only a part of your coins, because you will have to redeem it, and print another paper wallet for the change. With Electrum or Armory you can just move the desired coins using a USB stick, from your offline PC to the online one.

You guys are awful marketers. Seriously, you should get some professional help, for the love of Satoshi. First you say we should support you because this is good for Bitcoin. Now you tell me it's the free market, implying you are just trying to maximize your profit, and the price will be as high as people are willing to pay. I'm not against you profiting, but I doubt this will work. I don't have the numbers, but so far I have yet to see someone who is willing to pay that much for a Trezor and is not a super early adopter (thousands of coins). Most people who are already into Bitcoin and are serious about it already know how to set up their own cold storage for free. And the people who is just starting with this, won't be able to afford it or won't care. Maybe you have made lots of sales and I'm just not aware of it.
Just so you know, I have the coins but I won't buy this, just like I didn't buy ASICs, because this is an abuse. ASICs vendors succeeded in abusing the consumers, but I doubt you will be able to do the same. We'll see.

Nobody asked you to have part in it. It's not for early adopters.
An ETF has many advantages. For instance, like it happens with any other ETF, like gold or petroleum ETF's, you don't need to worry about its security, they will take care of it. Another advantage is that should something go wrong, you have someone to sue. A lot of people that are interested in Bitcoin but wouldn't know where to start, will trust the ETF.
Also, how much money in Bitcoin would you trust this or that "exchange" with? I would never put more than a few hundreds in an exchange run by some teenagers who got bored of playing with magic cards. But I would trust the ETF with many thousands.
Will I trust the ETF? Hell no. But that's only because I get security for free, being a nerd and all that. And I don't daytrade.

Just because you can be tracked in various ways, it doesn't mean it's not anonymous. Anonymous means that you are not attaching your ID to it. If we say that Bitcoin is not anonymous, then nothing in the Universe is anonymous, since it's deterministic and doesn't lose information, so everything can be traced back to its source.

If the hashing power becomes centralized, it doesn't matter who holds the Bitcoin. The experiment would have failed.
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:57:57
I'm thinking of the government/banking mafia. Governments don't need to be profitable since it's not their money to begin with, the taxpayer will take care of the costs.
Whatever attacks are possible by using a lot of hashing power (anything that can annoy or make lose money to merchants, consumers, or people who invest in Bitcoin), will be x2 easier/cheaper if half of the network is using the same pool. For example, they could double-spend and buy a lot of stuff in every marketplace. They don't even need to receive the products, just make the merchants lose them. A lot of people would drop Bitcoin and never come back.
I just don't feel very comfortable trusting that only profitable attacks are possible. Of course right now a big player could perform such an attack without DDOS'ing any pools. But still I think miners should be more responsible and move to p2pool. And pool owners should increase their prices to prevent more miners from joining them, and keep their pool's hashrate *a lot* lower than 50%.

Just wanted to add that "faster confirmation time" doesn't really mean anything useful. When you need confirmations it's because you need security. And having 6 confirmations in Bitcoin is waaay more secure than 6 confirmations in Litecoin.

That doesn't prove anything, and again, that's not how security is done. You can't rely on the secrecy of the code, and when you hear a website was hacked it's not because a hacker read the code (let alone the fact that your programmer can't possibly have coded the operating system too). And in most hacks you will never notice until it's too late. For all we know the site has been hacked since day 1, a hacker could be stealing unnoticeable little bits, or just waiting for more people to join to make his big blow. Hearing that something is secure because it's custom coded and secret is usually a red flag.
A quick glance at the website shows that it's vulnerable to one of the most common and dangerous web hacks: [CSRF]( And I swear I didn't read the code! :p
I don't enjoy bashing other people's work, I'm not a hater or a troll, but I felt obligated to tell you all this.

OP has already [said]( that's not the case. The data gathered is *not* being used for fraud prevention.


Yes, we know what a fingerprint is, but thank you for treating us as idiots who think it's magic. Saying that it's "just a number" is like saying all your data is "just text, no worries!". It doesn't matter what it is, but how it can be used. And it can be used to violate your privacy, like what every big company in the US has been doing, and there is massive evidence for that. And yet you dare call us tinfoil. No wonder the world is heading the way of 1984.

You guys keep ignoring the fact that a government could totally benefit from this. Governments don't need to be profitable, you know? They won't pay an attack to Bitcoin from their pocket, the taxpayer will do that, just like the taxpayer pays for all the propaganda, the spying, and the wars. Let alone the fact that the cost of attacking Bitcoin is nothing compared to what they get from manipulating the currency through the central banks. By having half the hashrate in a single pool, we are making it even easier.
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:08:39
I'm not sure that's how it works. It would be very convenient (unless we get killed) and comforting for us to just think that they are gonna kill us anyway, so better never give anything to them, so I think we might get biased in that direction.
I think a thief that didn't even manage to cover his expenses (guns/whatever) could end up shooting you out of anger, especially if he sees you as a wealthy person and thinks you are lying. Instead, if you give him or he finds something enough to cover his expenses, and eat for a week, he might just say "fuck it, I'll take this for now, I can try a big robbery again next week"

I don't know what you mean.
All you have to do is XOR both paper wallets with the same key. Then you can give the true result to a friend, and you keep the key and the fake result. If someone finds about your key or wallet and forces you, you can give him the key and the fake result, and the fake wallet will be opened.
You can even add more keys to split it in more parts.

You are comparing companies to technologies, which makes no sense. Litecoin/Tenebrix/Vaginacoin are just clones of Bitcoin with some variables changed. Changing the hashing algorithm for no good reason can't really be considered an "improvement" as some are claiming. Then there's also proof of stake, which is interesting, but it could be added to Bitcoin if needed. No need to create another crapcoin for every new feature, and try to lure people into buying them. Just take a look at Sunny King. He created Peercoin and claimed that it was superior because of PoS. People jumped in expecting to become rich, and then he created yet another coin: Primecoin. People jumped in too further diluting previous coins' value. The same happened with many other coins and their creators, the modus operandi is the same: Instead of improving their "creation" (or contributing to Bitcoin), they create a new coin for every stupid feature or re-branding they can come up with, eg: "The silver of Bitcoin", lol.

They are bare-bones and not deterministic, so you have to keep backing up your wallet whenever you create new addresses (though they generate 100 addresses each time, to mitigate the fuck ups a bit). With Armory and Electrum you create the backup when you create the wallet, and forget about the issue. They also have a lot of functionality like cold storage, which is the best you can have for security.

Gox prices are as real as any other prices. People are willing to buy/sell at those prices. The same happens with localbitcoins (usually higher than the rest) and btc-e (usually lower than the rest). Every exchange has its own situation, and people are using them for different reasons.
So what are you gonna do then? Remove all the outliers until you get the price that you think is "correct"? All the prices are correct under each particular situation.

I mean those things are explicit in the law. Eg: A judge can't order you to dance for him, there is no law for that. Same with handing over your keys. In US and UK though, there is a law for the keys. In other countries you can't even be forced to incriminate yourself (or even your wife/husband I think), so handing over your keys is out of question.

There are people to hire for anything. But if you look programmers as "just another employee", your tech startup is gonna fail.

@_date: 2013-10-31 21:12:09
It's not! Just follow the instructions from your client (eg: Armory or Electrum). It is also a lot easier if you use something like Trezor, since you plug it directly to your online machine, without risking being hacked.

I'm getting tired of that stupid phrase. You don need to avoid all risk, just learn how to manage it. Eg: Don't invest half of your savings (which you can't afford to lose) in Bitcoin alone. Invest 1/10 on 10 different, unrelated assets, one of which can be Bitcoin or Bitcoin companies. This way, even if Bitcoin fails horribly, your other assets will make up for it and you will still be doing well. It's a statistical trick.

For example, where did he get the key's fingerprint from? If he got it from the same website, he's fucked.
Besides, most people won't even know how to do this or won't bother. So should everyone be at risk by default? This is stupid. The website should use SSL so that everyone can be safe by default, and also have the signatures and whatnot in case an expert wants to check that too for extra security.

When I say code I mean the program you use to generate the keys.
You can't really know if the generated keys were random, unless you know that you received the same code as everyone else. If you downloaded the website's code by clicking "save page" in your browser (did you even do that?) for using it offline later, you are at risk because whoever controls the server could have sent you and only you (or a few other unlucky ones chosen at random) bad code, that would generate keys known to him.
The correct way is to download a not too recent, tagged version from github, where the code is being hosted as an open source project. This way you know you are at least receiving the same code as everyone else, and that a lot of people have reviewed it already.
To sum up, if bitaddress' owner is a bad guy, you could lose your coins any minute. But don't freak out, just take your time to understand this and do it right this time.

That's not enough for the average user though. What if they are randomly sending bad code? Eg: 1 out of every 100 or 1000 visits gets code that uses the same seed.

Apparently you don't know users. Nobody would use a website that is as inconvenient as the one you are describing. Just tell the web devs to fucking learn to use a kdf like scrypt and move on. And tell people not to store their life savings in a stupid website. In the end, if someone does steal a database, spends years trying to break one password, and manages to steal a few coins, I say he deserves to keep them. He probably lost more than what he earned. Nobody's gonna do that. You could also tell websites to force users to reset their passwords every year. That's more than enough.

drlsd is probably referring to the usual advice that you shouldn't keep your savings in an address that has revealed its public key (by spending), because in the future, with quantum computing or whatever it could be used to reconstruct the private key. Kind of far-fetched I know, but not wrong.

There was a time when being jew was perfectly legal in Germany. Then you know what happened. Just like nobody had a problem with drugs, until Christianity came in. There are probably lots of other examples.
So my point is Bitcoin (or any other harmless object or activity you are related to) could very well become illegal tomorrow. And if you throw under the bus others like you (eg: harmless SR/drugs users), there will be no one to fight for you either when they come for you.

In the world of investments, you have two types of analysis and analysts: the technical and the fundamental. The technical analysts are the nutjobs from BitcoinMarkets who try to find "trends", "fibonacci golden ratios", and other mambo jumbos that only work to a minimal degree, and only if a bot does it. The fundamental analysts are the people who understand what Bitcoin is all about, see a lot of value or potential in it (a lot more than the value reflected by its current market price), so we decide to invest long term and not care much about the daily fluctuations, because eventually the invisible hand of the economy will adjust the price to reflect more accurately its real value.

Tell me what you think of this:
- US based company does something that is illegal in any other country, and is an obvious privacy violation (even if you don't want to see it, which is also a very common syptom these days. See the massive evidence for NSA spying, assassinating, ruining standards, etc, and people are still denying it ever happened).
- Someone finds out, posts it to a forum, and becomes a popular thread.
- Shills from that company pop up and start upvoting/downvoting, posting nonsense like the link to their privacy policy, and smearing whitleblowers (eg: calling them tinfoil hats).
- (hypothetical) Turns out the company was using the data for something unrelated to security, like sharing the data with other companies, or selling it to the government, as "conspiracy nuts" warned. All this comes to light, some people get mad, but the next day it's forgotten.
What does that sound like? To me, it sounds like what has been happening all this time with every other company. So yes, Occam's Razor very much, based on historical data. This is the simplest explanation today. It just matches everything else in the world. A crazy explanation would be that the company is actually caring for something else than fast profit.
I'm tired and I don't wanna dig into this anymore, I was just trying to help others. But if I remember correctly, this is the same company that posted a page explaining their security. As a security expert, it was full of crap. They even listed as achievements, things that are defaults in any professional development framework. They also keep spamming this subreddit with bullshit stories, like "Bitcoin exploding in China!", etc.

Transaction priorities are defined in the protocol. Ignoring the protocol to turn money into power, or to make a quick buck is not good for Bitcoin. I saw a thread from 2012 in bitcointalk where Gavin and Mike discussed about this. Gavin wanted to tweak the protocol to maximize miners' profits, Mike didn't. I'm with Mike.


If they didn't calculate the fee correctly that's their fault. I don't see how a business could be created around a problem that can be fixed so easily and for less than a cent.
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:46:28
I think those features can make the difference between being secure and losing everything to a mistake or laziness. I wouldn't even bother saving in bitcoins without cold storage. It would be either too inconvenient or too insecure.

lol! Didn't know it was like that.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:15:36
That should work and you can do it with the official client, but it's pretty inconvenient. In that example he creates a transaction with only one input and one output (unusual), and typed them manually. He even skipped the fee and used the difference of input minus output instead.
I guess this could be made to be a lot easier if someone mapped the hashes to words, and also gave you a GUI so that you don't fuck up. Otherwise, I'm not even sure what can go wrong if you make a mistake. I wouldn't want to risk my coins like that.

Oh look, another idiot who doesn't understand fallacies, and thinks insult = ad hominem. Idiot. Also, you should put more effort in your punctuation, you sound retarded.
BTC and altcoin transactions take the same time for the same number of nodes. Bitcoin transactions never take more than 0-3 seconds. What might differ is the confirmation times, which doesn't make sense to make faster because confirmations are for security. If you are selling a house, you want secure confirmations, not fast confirmations. Bitcoin's confirmations are way more secure because they take a lot more work.

Well Bitcoin *is* anonymous (or pseudonymous, whatever), just not perfectly, so I wouldn't call it a "myth". It worked pretty well for whoever created Cryptolocker, and also worked fine for Silk Road. It also worked fine for me, since I'm not supposed to own or trade (let alone internationally) any currencies other than the local one, according to my government.
Yeah I know scrypt was supposed to do that, but on the other hand they are more vulnerable to traditional computing power. And just the fact that Satoshi predicted ASICs is enough reason to think scrypt isn't really an improvement.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:43:53

Making Bitcoin is awesome, making Litecoin is definitely not. Bitcoin didn't "copy plenty of existing cryptographic code", it reused it as libraries.
Let me list the steps to create Litecoin or any other one from the ever growing pool of trashcoins:
- Copy Bitcoin's code
- Change name
- Change some variable, like the reward, hashing algorithm, or whatever
- Publish
- Oops, forgot to change name of icons, fixed
- ???
- Hopefully, profit from people who missed the Bitcoin train and think they will be rich if they buy enough of your crapcoin. Cash out and buy the real thing: Bitcoin

Yes those traders. It's a price with a condition (can't withdraw fast). Just like you will find conditions everywhere else, eg: If you buy in localbitcoins, you will have different prices depending on the scarcity and the security on your location, how much the seller will have to travel, etc.
So it's not a "fake" price, and it doesn't make sense to talk about "real" prices either. All the prices are real.
We shouldn't use gox price, but we shouldn't use any single exchange price either. Just use a weighted [average](

Too bad you don't know how cryptocurrencies work. Faster confirmations are not a feature, just marketing bullshit.
If you want fast transactions, Bitcoin's 0 cofirmation transactions are as fast as you can get.
And if you want security, Bitcoin's confirmations are more secure than any other coin's confirmations, because of the hashing power.

Don't underestimate marketing and ignorance.

The high BTC prices are scaring people away too.

Bitcoin is supposed to be sound money, not Robin Hood.
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:22:20
This is bad. There are many scenarios in which you would lose everything: Hacking, fire, bit rot, etc.
To prevent hacking, you have to use cold storage, like explained in the Armory website. Download Armory and learn how to use it, it's the easiest choice since it actually has a graphic interface for this.
To prevent bit rot, fire, etc, store the wallet backup (created by Armory) in many places and/or in different formats. I like to have one encrypted copy in the cloud (encrypted Dropbox, but you could just use Mega or Wuala, which offer encryption out of the box), another copy in my offline laptop, an encrypted paper backup 1-of-1 (give copies to friends/family and keep some in my house. One could go to the bank safe too), and an unencrypted paper backup 3-of-3 (this one is in case I forget my password. One to each of my two friends or family members (preferrably they shouldn't know each other), and one for myself, so that it can only be recovered by gaining access to all of the 3 parts). These last things are not offered by Armory out of the box, but you can use Passguardian. I think doing anything less than this would be risky for a savings account, since you would be at risk of losing everything to something that wouldn't be too crazy: theft (should bitcoin become mainstream, this could become a thing), treachery, amnesia, accident (you or your friends), etc.

You shouldn't put in a safe anything that is not obviously valuable, because it will become obvious.
It's good to make these security mental exercises though, so well done. But like btchombre said, volatile memory can't be recovered the way you think. Otherwise, full disk encryption would be useless. Right now the only way to recover a piece of data from the RAM is to literally freeze it (with a spray or something) **while it still has power**, move it into another device and copy it.

I was just replying to shittyworld, who didn't know "what could be intercepted":  (note that I'm using SSL for browsing reddit)
This "SSL is only for banks" attitude is gonna bring a lot of trouble, and slow down Bitcoin adoption.
I'm not attacking you, but I have seen this a lot, even in websites where security can be a life or death matter, like Wikileaks. So whenever someone asks whether SSL should be used, or what are the risks of not using it, I try to explain.
In your case, the only risks are these:
- Malware for stealing Bitcoin directly from your users. Your site is a better target than other random websites, because nearly 100% of your visits will be Bitcoin users.
- Your donations being redirected to the hacker's address, without you ever even noticing.
If your website is not very popular, you could as well just ignore all this. If it is popular, you should care.

That's not the point. The point is that if you download a not very recent version of the code from github and verify the checksum, you can trust that others have reviewed it.

Even if you can read code, doing it every time you download something is unrealistic, and nobody's gonna do that.

I would argue that buying Bitcoin is not easy at all, let alone doing it securely. So this ETF is a great thing. Once Bitcoin goes mainstream, and products like Trezor can be bought everywhere, and you can buy Bitcoin from anyone (eg: your neighbours), we won't need the ETF anymore. The Winklevoss will have already earned a good sum of money, but even if they don't, the Bitcoin they already hold will be much more valuable, so everybody wins.

That was the advice for people who don't know the first thing about money or investments (people who knew something just ignored this advice and everything went even better than expected), and were incurring on debt for what was basically a lottery ticket back then. Now it's 2013, the hash rate of the network has gone to the moon, and Bitcoin is a lot safer. Still you shouldn't risk your life on it, but it's a pretty solid investment. You might want to have some gold though if you want to be prepared for a SHTF scenario, since Bitcoin depends on the internet.

You can start with 1k, and if it happens to be a nice person, next time you can go for 10k.

For me as a buyer it worked like this:
1. Browse sell offers
2. Choose one to buy (you pick the amount of bits you want or how much traditional money you want to spend)
3. Exchange a couple messages with the seller, and arrange to meet at McDonalds at noon
4. localbitcoins gives you a short password
5. Seller sends his bits to localbitcoins and you can see that, so now you know that at least he has them
6. Meet at McDonalds, seller turns out to be pretty cool guy, not a drug dealer at all
7. Put money on the table, seller counts it
8. Seller tells localbitcoins to release the bits since everything is ok, and localbitcoins gives him the password
9. Seller shows you the password, you see it's ok so now you know for sure that the bitcoins are in your localbitcoins account
10. You go back to your house and withdraw your bitcoins from localbitcoins, they will charge you a small fee.

In 2011 Bitcoin was still what we like to call other coins: a botnetcoin. Which means a botnet could have easily fucked everything up. Not permanently, of course, but it would have hurt Bitcoin's image and stopped adoption for many years. There were also many bugs that were discovered and fixed before anyone could exploit them. Also, for every bitcoiner that is not a security expert and didn't lose his coins, there are lots of bitcoiners that lost everything to a hacker, virus, mistake, scam, or whatever. So tonight before going to sleep, you should pray to Satoshi and thank him for this gift, and for having a plan for you.

Investing into a Bitcoin clone is not diversifying, that's my point. If you want to diversify invest in gold, stocks, or whatever.
Investing into Litecoin/Tenebrix/Vaginacoin is like investing in an inflationary currency, because more and more coins keep popping up further diluting their value, and every time people think this is their chance of being early adopters. The only winners there are the creators of the coins, a few GPU miners that get loads of coins very early and sell them very cheap (because they know there really isn't any value in them), and the exchanges' owners who get fees regardless of the success or failure of the coins.
And now Litecoin bagholders are going to jump and say that they are at an all time high. Yeah well that's the thing about altcoins, they are so small that they can be easily pumped and dumped. Read the quoted comment (since the original was removed) to see what happens inside the minds of Litecoin holders:

Actually if marketing is what you are looking for, there are other coins doing much better than Litecoin in that respect.
But personally, I prefer to analyse the technical aspects, since that's the reason why Bitcoin is so revolutionary.
Changing the hashing algorithm doesn't add anything interesting in my opinion. You think Satoshi didn't know other algorithms? Please.
Proof of stake is interesting, but it could be added to Bitcoin if needed, no need to jump into random crapcoins for the features. Besides their networks are too weak, better improve Bitcoin which has a network with a massive hashing rate.

Use a cheap laptop with Armory for cold storage, and keep an encrypted backup on the cloud. You only need to have the blockchain in your online machine. If it's too large use Electrum instead.
For small purchases keep a hot wallet with less money, you can use blockchain.info and access it from anywhere.

If you keep all your Bitcoins in some website, you are doing it wrong. One of the key features of Bitcoin is that *you* are in control of your own money.

People here are suggesting that you should use an online wallet. Don't, that's terrible advice for investments. One of the main features of Bitcoin is that *you* are in control, not the bank, not the government, not some kid with a website, etc., without losing the ability to make international transactions.
Learn how to deal with private keys (eg: paper wallet, brain wallet, etc), and/or how to use cold storage with Armory or Electrum. I wouldn't recommend Armory to a noob right now, because it has all kinds of problems (if you get past them, it's the best wallet IMO). But a major release of Armory should come out any time and it will be perfect for everyone, so you should keep an eye on it.


The paper wallets generated by that website are simply an address and a private key. The private key is your right to spend the coins from that address, so you should keep it somewhere safe, away from cameras, room mates, and bitcoin users. You can have many copies to be safe from losing it, but you are not very safe from physical theft, so you have to pick the places carefully. If you ever lose one of your copies, create a new paper wallet and move the coins. Also, remember that if you ever want to spend the coins in a paper wallet, you have to spend them all, or you will lose the change. The traditional way of doing it is you import the private key in a bitcoin client, spend what you want to spend, then create a new paper wallet and send the change.

Dollars come from many different places, eg: travellers. But gold? You can only get the real thing from banks, so it's not possible.
That's why I use Bitcoin: Unlike gold, you can't stop it, it's easy to transport, keep safe, and verify its authenticity.

Try to make very clear that there is no direct benefactor, and that the fees we pay are *nothing* like they are in any other service, they are almost non-existent (less than a cent). It's hard to explain that the fees goes to the miners and are ruled by the free market. So yeah I have no clue how to do this, I shouldn't be commenting.

Someone should set up a way to buy with credit card, with a reputation and limits system. Everyone talks about how people would exploit this by issuing chargebacks, but in reality I think it wouldn't happen much, the reputation and limits system would take care of it, and they would be a very little % of the margins anyway (consider it a cost of the business). Maybe the limits could be increased and the commission decreased after each month based on the successful transactions, in such a way that even if at some point someone decided to issue a chargeback, he would have put enough money already. Initially, an account could take a month or two since the first deposit to be ready to buy btc, since the first transaction is the most risky one for the seller. With this alone I think you are already pretty safe, and anyway it would be annoying for scammers.
With credit cards we pay in pesos, you get dollars, and *both* win due to the spread between the official and the actual exchange rate. Any web developer worth his salt can set the whole thing up in a few hours (though the reputation and limits system should be thought carefully), you have lots of services in the US that make accepting payments very easy.
Recently this site popped up:  The service worked fine and they made some sales, but they were lacking in the security department and now they seem to be fixing that.


For day to day we use pesos, yes. It's like merchants who accept bitcoin even when it's volatile or don't know much about it, they do business with it and then convert it to something else.

Start by going to the [Armory]( website. Read the guide, download it, learn how to use it. Cold storage is the only way to have a secure wallet for savings, and Armory is the only wallet that has a graphic interface for dealing with this. Don't worry about the warning message, that's temporary, and doesn't affect offline wallets since you don't download the blockchain there.

First of all, what the hell is a privacy policy these days anyway? It's just something to give customers a warm fuzzy feeling. How many companies have broken their own policies? All of them. If there ever is a company that doesn't, it makes news, like Lavabit and Yahoo did. Those are outliers, not the rule.
And second, the only "valid" reason for fingerprinting your users, is for security. But as OP already said in a comment, he switched his environment and it didn't trigger any anti-fraud protections. So they are outright lying about this, which is the normal behavior these days, and shouldn't need more evidence. On top of that, they send their squad of shills to upvote/downvote every comment.

Miners create/find blocks (in which they include our transactions) which are added to the blockchain. They don't own the blocks, blocks are public information. Miners just work for us, and we pay them a fee.


It's the opposite: older coins have a lower fee, and might qualify for a free transaction (no fee). Not sure why, maybe because they are safer since being old means they have been confirmed more times. And once the coins are moved they become young again, meaning this can't be abused.

It threw an error because I didn't manually calculate and substract the fee. I got annoyed by this terrible user experience, and for some reason (rage? intuition?) I then *added* the fee to my amount, instead of substracting it. And it worked! They payed me a fee for withdrawing funds, lol. Needless to say, I never used the site again.

Welcome to Bitcoin. I'm sorry but your nationallity doesn't mean anything here, since we don't have armies or wars. You are now just another self-aware bit of the Universe, who has been given the gift of cryptography, which gives you a tremendous power, but can only be used for good. For instance, you can now own real money, prove that it's yours, and no one can take it from you, nor destroy its value. Listen to the Ciphers and you will be greatly rewarded.

If you have RAM use Armory. Else use Electrum or wait until the next version of Armory which should come out any time now. They are deterministic wallets which means you backup once and forget about it, also they allow you to set up a cold storage scheme and other cool stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:20:35
I don't know what Armory does. I'm just saying that key-stretching has not been defeated and must be done by the developers, we can't expect that normal users learn how to do that themselves. If you think Armory is doing it wrong please open a new issue on github (though I think the project is kind of dead). There's not much more we can do.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:28:16
Good point.

I agree that the protocol must be able to stand by itself, but we will never be able to stop people from opting-in on greenlists and giving away their rights, unless we campaign against that. Just like a lot of people new to Bitcoin come in and think keeping all their coins in an exchange is the way to go, they might also think registering their addresses is the way to go if the government tells them so and we are not there to say otherwise.
It's not a personal attack if it's absolutely relevant. The guy is a sociopath and undeniably he has a lot of power. He will get a very influential position in the Bitcoin world and will reach a lot of people. This is bad.

Virwox is a pain, very expensive, slow, you have to go through the risk of buying SLL because there is no direct USD-&gt;BTC route, and they will even retain your coins randomly "for security", sometimes for days, even if you have been a user for a long time. Forcing people to buy SLL is pretty scammy in my opinion, it drives liquidity down, prices up, and you even have to pay a fee for each transaction.
I think Localbitcoins is the best option in the UK, but English people don't seem very happy about having to meet strangers in real life.
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:07:00
It doesn't. Not every buy expecting its value to increase is speculation. In wikipedia it clearly says it's only in the short or middle term, and without caring about the actual utility of the asset.
By your definition, if I buy gold thinking in my children's future, I'm speculating. If I buy shares, to help the economy and make some money at the same time, I'm speculating. If I lend money, which might help new business get started, I'm speculating. We could just get rid of the word "investment" then.
I don't understand this need to use a negative word for anyone who wants to make money. Is being a slave of the system the only acceptable option? Who am I harming by "speculating".

Just because everything has gone to shit in the US, it doesn't mean everyone else should throw years of studying the law and trying to improve it.
If you are not an artist it won't be intuitive to you. But they *do* get hurt for stuff like this. It's unfair to them, it de-motivates them, it does not foment creation.
Suppose I took a picture of your face and wanted to use it for advertisement or whatever. Or a picture of you doing something that you don't want others to know. Would you not want to have rights on your own image? Would you still accept that the image "is just information and information must be free"? I'm telling you this because it's the closest a non-artist can get to understanding this.

Bitcoin gave power back to the people, so now you have to take care of securing your own savings. The good news is that unlike gold or other valuable stuff, bitcoin is very cheap to store safely, thanks to cryptography. All you need is a $200 laptop to be used for cold storage, and a wallet that lets you sign transactions offline, like [Armory]( So what you are gonna do is install it in you offline machine, create a new wallet, create a paper backup (test deleting the wallet and recovering it with the paper backup), and transfer all your funds there from your online machine.

All the altcoins have that kind of % of increase, every day. It's like playing Satoshi Dice. It's not investing.
Downvoters probably don't know about Cryptsy. I have gambled a few coins there, which bought me millions of crapcoins like Infinitecoin. Infinitecoin went from 1 satoshi to ~300 satoshis just like that, and just like Litecoin, it did so for no reason. No merchant adoption, no good news, not anything, it just happened overnight, and I cashed out with a nice profit to buy more of the real thing: Bitcoin.

It's not that hard, it's just installing some software and understanding the concept, but if they already can send emails, they can't be bothered having to install more stuff. Also, when you encrypt emails from your machine, then you can't read them with the web client (eg: gmail), which is kind of the point, but people get annoyed.
If you wanna give it a try, download Thunderbird and then install the Enigmail addon (all free software). If you are in Windows you will have to install gpg4win too. Once you have that, you generate a key pair, that is, a private and a public key, and share the public one with your friends or upload it to the keys server so that anyone can find it. With your public key, people will be able to send you encrypted emails, or verify the emails that you sign. With your private key, you will be able to decrypt those emails, or sign the emails that you send. If your friends do the same, you will be able to communicate privately.

No. I mean the backups created by Armory, either digital or paper, but always encrypted, except for the n-of-n part. Armory tells you to just store the (unencrypted) paper backup somewhere safe, but I think that's not good enough, that's why I encrypt it. The digital one is already encrypted.

A currency is money that is being used, that circulates. Not money that is taxable.
Like I said, you got used to being robbed at gunpoint. Not every country will force you to pay capital gains, and put you in a cage or ruin your life in other ways if you don't. Remember that the government should work for you, not the other way around. If you happen to like your government and want to pay your taxes as they are right now, fine. But at least with Bitcoin you will have a choice. It's not a full solution, but it will help. It's cash over the wire.

Take a look at Armory. Unlike other wallets, it explains what cold storage is, why you should use it, how to use it step by step, and it even has a graphic interface for that.

It's very funny to see non-genius single-field academics (as opposed to Satoshi) struggle to analyze Bitcoin to find its flaws. Cryptographers say individual components have been used correctly, but complain about the lack of a security model and say that any other thing is a waste of time, because we can't prove it's secure (with their little models). Economists rage about the deflationary dark spiral of death and their fears of not having daddy big bank controlling everything. Game Theorists don't even have a consensus, anything can happen. And finally you have all of them and many others, trying to use arguments from each others' fields, and nobody has a clue on why Bitcoin even works.

- Fixed supply, inflation free
- Decentralized, not subject to government regulations
- Secured by the laws of the Universe
- And all the things you want in a currency, like divisibility, fungibility, durability, etc etc.
- At the same time it's a payment platform, can make international wires nearly for free, there's no difference with local transactions
Momentum: Bitcoin got the right marketing, the right persons read the paper and believed in it, gained tracktion, and now it juts can't be stopped. This new kind of cryptocurrencies initiated by Satoshi is clearly the future, due to the fundamentals mentioned above. And since Bitcoin was the first one to be adopted, even if it's not perfect, it's the one that's going to take over the world. The same happened with many other technologies, like TCP/IP (the protocol of the internet). It's no coincedence that many engineers thought of the same analogy independently when we saw Bitcoin take off.

I don't know about blockchain, but I would be more worried about your PC.
You should keep your Bitcoins offline anyway, you don't need to trust anyone, that's a key feature of Bitcoin. It's not that easy at the moment, but it's getting better...
In case you don't know, the right to spend the Bitcoins you have in an address is just a private key, which is a long string of characters. You don't need an online service to remember that string for you. You could keep it in a piece of paper (we call it paper wallet), or in an offline machine. If you are in the US, I think they are already selling paper wallet printers over there, which make it as easy as pressing a button. There is also Trezor, which is super easy and secure, but it's not available just yet, and it's a bit expensive (1 Btc).

If they are into copycoins they already had access to their products through Bitcoin. There is zero benefit in a Bitcoin world to move toward copycoins. It's not the same as a fiat world moving toward Bitcoin, which is a fantastic step in the right direction.

If they sell all those Bitcoin the price would go down, so yes, it could affect you in the short term (for me it would be another chance to buy cheap coins). But in the long term nothing changes, the maximum amount of Bitcoin is still 21kk. It could also happen that they lose those coins and everyone else becomes a little bit richer.

The idea doesn't fail over HTTP, that's what the protocol is for. The website responds with rules on how the response can be cached, at some point it passes through the ISP, and if the ISP decides so, it can cache it based on those rules.

It's confusing when you say "key". One thing is the passphrase you have when you use an encrypted wallet (optional), and another thing is the private key you have for each address. If you have the latter, you don't need anything else (not even the address), just import the private key into a new wallet.

Hmm I didn't met anyone who knew what crypto was.
I like to think about Bitcoin like moving from Windows to Linux. It happened to me and other friends: When you are on Windows, you become apathetic about security, because even if you learn a few things, you are probably gonna get owned anyway, so why bother. Then you move to Linux, and now you have a chance, so you start caring. I think a similar thing might happen with Bitcoin: Suddenly people realize they can be their own banks, so they might start caring. With Trezor or an easier Armory, this could become a thing.

@_date: 2013-11-25 01:07:54
I say this is not diversification because whatever risks Bitcoin has, the other coins have that x1000, because they don't have enough hashing power. If someone has the power to kill Bitcoin, he can as well just kill all the other altcoins with little extra effort (scrypt doesn't matter), let alone the fact that it will destroy the confidence in cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, if someone has the power to kill Vaginacoin, that doesn't mean he can kill Bitcoin. So buying other coins is actually increasing your risk.

This feature has been requested many times, but the author keeps telling us it's dangerous and that he doesn't want to deal with more hate mail from users who have lost coins. I'll ask for it again:
Encrypted paper backup. It's like a normal paper backup, but it requires a password to be used. This way, if someone finds it or steals it, he won't be able to steal the coins. And no, n-of-m doesn't replace this. Both could be used to be safe from different scenarios. In case you decide to implement it, please strengthen the password with a key derivation function, and add its details to the backup. Don't just shaX(password) it.
I agree it's dangerous for normal users. So just put it in the advanced mode, and add a warning in red.

It's just a private key that you generate with an algorithm + a passphrase. So we say it's in your brain because all you need to remember to reconstruct the private key is the passphrase. The algorithm is usually just 1 round of sha256. It could be a gazillion rounds for more security, but most generators (eg: brainwallet.org, bitaddress.org) only use one. That's why you have a lot of people creating huge databases of common passphrases and their resulting private keys, importing them into their wallets, and a bot would check the balance every second to see if there are new coins to steal.

The homeless, the young, the poor, anyone not eligible for a credit card, any country with inflation and currency controls (most third world countries). Most of the world can't even open a bank account, but with Bitcoin you only need internet. A lot of Americans don't know or don't realize this, but a lot of the homeless, young, and people in third world countries have phones and internet. There are African countries where people use phone credit as a currency :S. It will also help people working in foreign countries, since sending money back home won't be a robbery anymore, Bitcoin fees are ridiculously low. And that's only the "freedom" part, but Bitcoin brings a lot more. The poor or financially illiterate will now be able to save and be rewarded for it, instead of being robbed and punished through inflation. Before Bitcoin that was only possible for the rich or financially literate.

Those guys are the ones with most interest in spamming crapcoins, since they profit anyway with the trading fees. They lied about their expertise and the amount of work being done in their coins (eg: Bottlecaps), just take a look at the github repositories. They didn't even know how to properly tag a commit, someone had to tell them how to do it. All the work was being done in their exchange and other projects they have.

That it works for your particular setup doesn't mean that it's usable for everyone. I'm pretty sure they are requiring some intrusive option, that is usually enabled by default in most browsers, but that web devs should definitely not make it a requirement and instead use graceful degradation.
Besides, there's a horizontal scrollbar which is visible for everyone, and which is definitely evidence of a rushed product. I don't care much about that one, I just want to download Armory. But apparently using funny javascript links is more important than being usable, so someone who supported Armory from the beginning now can't even download it.

You don't give up your anonymity by physically being there. Thieves don't normally present their ID's before robbing you, do they. They can get caught because they can be followed or traced if they make mistakes or if whoever is after them has enough resources. The same happens with Bitcoin. And if you get caught stealing there are going to be repercussions, like it happened to the guy who ran a Ponzi scheme with Bitcoin.
So all you have to do is not go full retard and send your money to some guy in the other side of the world, because he's going to be more difficult to catch than if he is in your country, with a known physical address, etc.

If you have easy access to buying bitcoin, a way of supporting bitcoin can be to save in bitcoin whatever you want to save, but what you want to spend anyway do it in bitcoin too! Eg: Today I earned $100, and want to save $60, and spend $40 in some stuff I want to buy. So I buy 1 BTC, save 0.6, and spend 0.4. I might even get a discount for paying in bitcoin.

I'm telling you: because it is more secure. They will make sure the guy actually has the Bitcoin, and if the operation is then cancelled, they freeze those Bitcoin for 24hs. Also, the buyer only needs to carry the cash with him, no need to carry a laptop or anything like that, because they give both a password, so when the buyer is shown that password, he knows the transaction succeeded. And finally, it helps build a reputation, so when you see a guy with 30 successful transactions and with good feedback, you know he's not gonna rob you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:11:39

I understand mining well enough, thanks. But having temporary miners doesn't really secure the network.
Every time a new Bitcoin clone pops up, miners jump in temporarily to make a profit and then move to the next profitable coin, and so on and so forth (they use automated calculators for finding the next coin). They don't really believe in those coins, and they are definitely not supporting them.

What would you do if when you finally decide to spend your coins, you find out you can't because nobody accepts them, because you need to "clean" them through some centralized authority, who might not even be in your country?

I agree with the video.
You guys pronounce "bit" like it was the English "ee" or Spanish "i", not the usual English "i". Right? Then there is "byte", which sounds like English "i", and Spanish "ai".
English: Spanish
a: ei, or sometimes a
e: e or i, randomly
i: ai, or sometimes i
o: ou, or sometimes o
u: a or u, randomly
oo: u
ee: i
Edit: Forgive me, this list is retarded and incomplete, I thought it would be easier. But you get the point.
Those would be the basic patterns, but then you have words like "air" which I think don't follow any rules. Or words like "be", which differ between American and British.

Anyone can create [unsigned] transactions, but they are useless until they are signed, because that's the proof that the one trying to spend the coins actually owns them. In a cold storage scheme, when you want to spend, you would normally create an unsigned transaction in your online machine, sign it with your offline machine, and then broadcast it with your online machine (all this using a USB pendrive to move the transaction around).

I think more important than that, is using an offline computer with Linux + Armory. In your online computer use whatever you want + Armory. Personally, I also use Linux in my online computer, because once you get used to it it is so much better in everything, but it's probably not for everyone.

Just use [Armory]( it will let you sleep at night. If your main concern is losing the private keys, this is something I do: create an encrypted paper backup\*, and give copies to friends and also keep some in your house. Then create an unencrypted paper backup, and encrypt it with Passguardian into a n-of-n scheme, eg: 4-of-4, give 3 to your friends/family and keep one yourself. This way, if you lose your keys, but you remember the password, all you have to do is find one of the encrypted paper backup copies. Or if you lose your keys *and* forget your password, you still can recover it if you recover all of the 4 parts of the 4-of-4 scheme.
\* Armory doesn't let you encrypt the paper backup, you will have to type it and then encrypt it with aes-256 or other symmetric encryption algorithm.

Of course the implementation can be improved, but that doesn't mean it has to be done through an altcoin. Bitcoin code isn't static, you know? It gets improved every day. That's why Litecoin has to keep up with the copy + pasting.

Another way to see it is that lawsuits are a tool for *repairing* a damage that has already been done. So whoever is issuing a morally and legally correct lawsuit is the victim, and is already at loss.
One of the problems and why some people see this as violence, is that in some countries (eg: USA), lawsuits are not only for repairing, but also for *punishing*. That's why in many countries, a little injury like a burn or bruise caused by someone else's negligence will cost him one or two thousands at most, while in the US it could cost him millions.

I don't think this is right. First of all, isn't a private key a sha-256 hash? Second, you are going to have to remember a salt and the number of iterations. And if the salt is not random and instead is fixed in the code (eg: hash of the passphrase), then you are relying on the secrecy of the code, which already sucks, but you also need to make sure that you never lose it or at least be able to rewrite it.
I would say that the only solution is to just run a very high number of unsalted sha-256 iterations, with a decent passphrase.
Using pbkdf2 is very good for paper wallets though. This way you can store them all over the place without worrying about someone finding one, because he would still need the pass phrase.

My thoughts exactly, but then I also thought that I don't really want to rely on that. I think unless you make a mistake, cracking your sha256 hash should be impossible.


So the user manually writes a number, and that's the seed? I don't see how you could cheat though. Once you create the hash that includes the server's random number and show it to the user, how are you gonna change the random number? Wouldn't that require that you find a collision?

This is good, people criticizing your scheme probably didn't understand the encrypted part.
I think the only problem with this (not really a problem *yet*) is that you are defenceless against an opportunity attack. Eg: Someone could kidnap and torture you to get your password, and run away with the coins, since you can access them anywhere. Don't tell anyone that you have such amount of coins or that you use such security scheme. Consider investigating about n-of-m schemes (a new version of Armory is about to be released with that feature) for when Bitcoin goes fully mainstream.

Because your debt-based money sucks. I'm not joking, this is the reason.


Because Bitcoin is not a US-centered thing, it's the currency of the world. Now everyone will be able to participate in the online economy, not just the US and countries where US companies decide to land.

That's not really an argument in this case, most exchanges were created by random dudes, some don't even know the basics of web development.


Right, that's a problem in the US. Well, never mind then :(


Prices go up, salaries go up too (though not always at the same speed, that's up to each employee to fight for). What gets directly ruined are savings and industries that export. Say someone sells merchandise for US$1: he won't receive AR$10 like he should, he will receive AR$5. Another problem is that the government doesn't update the taxation ranges, so regular people and businesses end up being taxed like they were rich.

Yes that's what I think, just like Lavabit and Yahoo's founders/CEO's weren't able to tell us the details of what was going on, and just like many others (Google, Microsoft, and probably every significant US company) simply decided to let the government do whatever they wanted, and outright lie to their customers. If Bitcoin becomes an economical threat, NDA's will be the least of pool owners' worries.


"Yeah lol! Laugh at the stupid conspiracy theorists! They all crazy!"
With that attitude, there is no way in hell you will be able to react in the event of an attack. There is too much in stake, we are not building some small website and deciding some measure is too much security for it.


I know that rule, but it doesn't apply (and you are doing exactly what it says you shouldn't do: you are ruling out malice). We already have massive evidence about how evil governments are. If that wasn't the case, we wouldn't even need Bitcoin. Remember what the Genesis block says. You think that's incompetence? The owners of the Fed are just "dumb" and are making mistakes, that conveniently fill their pockets? What about the congress? They buy stocks from the military-industrial complex, and then approve the buying of more and more tanks (even after the military already asked to stop sending tanks, because they don't have a use for them) because they are dumb?

My only hope is that by that time they have bigger issues to worry about, or that politicans are lazy (very likely) and try to pass the problem to the next guy (and then Bitcoin will be too big to be stopped), or that even government employees happen to like Bitcoin and plot to avoid destroying it.

With cold storage you have unlimited addresses that you create with your watch-only wallet (online, includes addresses but not private keys, so it can't spend), and also the ability to create unsigned transactions in your online machine, safely sign them in your offline machine, and then broadcast them with your online machine. With the paper wallet the coins are safe only while you are not using them. When you want to spend them you will be exposed to the same risks as with the online wallets, unless you import the key in a cold storage wallet if you know how to by that time. So cold storage is better in every aspect.

You can buy them anonymously on localbitcoins, but since you are using the internet, you might also want to learn how to be anonymous there, which is a separate topic.
Another option is buying them not anonymously, and then passing them through a mixer. Blockchain.info lets you mix your coins for 0.5% I think.
For spending, you depend on the merchant. If he requires some sort of ID verification, you just can't do it, unless of course you fake that too, which is probably a very clear crime everywhere, not worth it if you are just looking to protect your privacy. Just find another merchant.
One gotcha is that it doesn't end with that spending. Imagine some change went back to your wallet during that transaction, and then you unknowingly spend it in something that isn't anonymous. Your identity could be revealed that way.

That's fine, but you are trusting the author this way. What if one good day he decides that he hasn't got everything he deserves in life, and makes his site send bad code randomly (eg: 1 out of 1000 visits)? Just like everyone in this thread, the unlucky one who receives the bad code is gonna say "Oh but everyone uses this site and it has been there for years, I can trust it!". And some time later, when he less expects it, he's gonna lose his savings and the author of bitaddress will be long gone. Verifying the signature won't save you.
Better download the code from github (preferably a tagged, popular, not very recent version) to make sure you are receiving the same code as everyone else. This way you are trusting in open source, you are trusting that others reviewed the code.

The protocol uses a formula to calculate the priority for confirming each transaction. The priority is higher depending on how old the coins are, how high the amount is, and how small the size in bytes is. So when you use young coins or very few coins or lots of inputs/outputs, you have to pay a small fee (the minimum has been 0.0001 for a while). Fees are earned by the miner who mines the block, along with the reward. Eventually, when the reward goes to 0 (when ~21kk bitcoins have been mined), miners will only earn the fees. That's the incentive Satoshi created so that rational, independent players (the miners) would want to support and strengthen the Bitcoin network.

Value is not the same as nominal price in a particular currency, and also wealth is not a cake that can only be split (a very common fallacy), it can be created. When the economy grows increasing the total wealth in the world, anyone holding a Bitcoin (or gold) becomes richer.

@_date: 2013-08-31 07:04:57
I wouldn't rely on this method.
First of all, GPG'ing it more times won't really add much more security, and it's very inconvenient. Normally, you should use cryptographic algorithms as they are given to you, don't try to create your own crazy scheme (experts don't do it, you shouldn't do it). For instance, instead of encrypting it twice with two different passwords, just concatenate both passwords to create a longer password and encrypt it once. The third password you used (the hash of the list) makes no sense, discard it.
Second, and most important point, the odds of you forgetting at least one character of one of the two passwords compared to the odds of someone breaking the cipher, are too damn high. Just pick one of the two passwords, and stretch it with a key derivation function (eg: PBKDF2 or Bcrypt) if you want. This will be much stronger than your two passwords combined. Just remember to save the information of the method used along with the resulting ciphertext of your wallet. Example: { encrypted-wallet: asfsdfasfs, kdf: pbkdf2, salt: asdfadsf, iterations: 100000 }
And finaly, if you went through all this hassle to secure the wallet, just store it in the cloud! The physical backups are good, but you should also have a copy in Dropbox and Mega or whatever. Imagine you had to run away from wherever you are living. Having a copy in the cloud will save you, since you can access it from anywhere.

"Bit" sounds like the one speaking tried to say "beet" but got lazy or something (we do this sometimes), but now I know those words sound always the same and different with each other.
I have an anecdote about this: We were walking by the beach with persons from different countries, when a french guy says "Come over here, the sand is better here". And an American started laughing because he thought it was a joke, because he heard: "Come over here, the *sun* is better here". So everyone asked him why he was laughing and he explained, and the french said "no no, the sand" and pointed to the sand. Americans said "Ahh, the sand" (correctly pronounced), and everyone was like "Wtf, get outta here", like Americans were too picky with the pronunciation, lol. Now it makes more sense.

Yes, when the developers want to change something, first they obviously discuss it, and if it seems like it can take off, they do it and then they tell everyone to download it. But it's the miners who decide whether to accept the change or not, since they are the ones securing the network. You could say they vote with their hashing power.
If you ask me, the developers still have a lot of power though. I think they could get away with almost any change, unless it's visibly harmful for the miners.

Seriously, I think the myth is that it is easy (it's not). There are a thousand ways to screw up. I mean, you mentioned hoarding. You shouldn't hoard unless you have succeeded to set up cold storage with a good backup scheme. Hardware wallets like Trezor will solve this problem, but until then I can't really recommend it to friends or family, unless they want me to store their bitcoins for them.

Because Javascript is [turing-complete]( and it's code that will run in your client, not in the server. It's a matter of tradeoffs. If you only have 1 BTC in the same machine you use for browsing the web, I guess it's ok. But if you are storing your savings wallet there, running Javascript is retarded. In fact the machine should never be connected to the internet.

The important part is the *protocol*, which is just a language used to communicate through the wires. You can write your own *client* that adheres to that protocol and run a *node* with it just fine, nodes using other clients will accept you as a peer.
But you are right about downloading untrusted software, you are asking the right questions. Making sure you are not being backdoored is pretty difficult and inconvenient, and most people (even techies) will never do it right.
Therefore, if you want to *save* in Bitcoin, you should only use the most popular and trusted *desktop* clients (Bitcoin-qt, Armory, Electrum, Multibit), only download them through a *secure connection* (https), and also use *cold storage* if possible (only available in Armory and Electrum -and Trezor, which is a hardware wallet-). You will be basically trusting that *someone else* is keeping an eye on the source and performing checksums on the binaries, which is how every other piece of open source software (you are probably using many already) in the world works.
Note that you should be more afraid of installing closed source programs (not even related to Bitcoin), because those could steal coins from your online machine just as easily. That's why you need cold storage.

The difference is when BTC appeared there were no other currency with these properties -.-

@_date: 2013-11-07 08:26:58


Exactly. I think it's kind of unfair for everyone the fact that non-techies jumped into Bitcoin so early. They don't even know the risks they are exposed to, and it's certainly not reflected in the market price. Some will survive by pure chance, others will lose everything. Hackers / thieves will gain a lot. And honest techies will have to pay highly inflated prices to buy more coins.

It would have been only one, but you say it's non-sensical and keep on complaining. Most people new to Bitcoin don't know how their own money works, and that's the source of a lot of confusion. That's why I think it's important to point out that difference.

That's only for relaying. Normal nodes help relaying good blocks and stopping bad ones. But it's the miners who collectivelly decide which are the good ones, by creating more blocks on the same chain. Nodes will just follow the longest chain, and the chain is created by the miners.

I recommend it for the cold storage feature, it's one of the few wallets that offer that, and it's only one that has a graphic interface for that, making it a viable solution. It uses bitcoin-qt in the background, and bitcoin-qt downloads the entire blockchain. In your offline computer though, you don't need to have the blockchain at all, so no worries.
Cold storage is the way to go for savings wallets. Any other option is a risk nobody should accept.

Nothing. Nobody needs the "best" thing. What you need is something that works, is simple, and everybody uses. Bitcoin has been compared to the TCP/IP protocol, which has beaten the alternatives because it was easy enough to implement and got momentum, even though the alternatives were considered better, more robust, more studied, etc. Once a lot of vendors were using TCP/IP, everyone else followed, and now the entire internet uses it.

That's what some say, but on the other hand you have them saying stupid shit like "we don't want to live in a world dominated by murderers and terrorists", "we want to work with the authorities", "western governments are good", etc.


The survival of Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) *does* depend on what their developers do. If they go full retard, the coin will die. I know, "anyone can fork it". But such a fork would definitely delay a global adoption decades or even centuries, as the trust in cryptocurrencies would get hurt badly.

As expected they didn't, but someone mentioned the da Vinci Code, which was great because I was gonna tell them the whole story anyway, how Cryptography is so important nowadays for intelligence and war, and as example what happened to the creator of PGP, and the recent NSA revelations. So by the time I say Bitcoin is based on Cryptography,  solves a problem that people have been trying to solve for years, and it hasn't been hacked yet, they understand it's not a toy.
So far it has been the best route. Any other route will make them think you just fell in some internet scam, and you will have to be constantly defending yourself.

That makes no sense whatsoever. At some point this Trezor will cost more than a car. Even if you are paid in BTC, pay everything in BTC, and save in BTC, Trezor will be more and more expensive in real value. Just because someone is paid in BTC, it doesn't mean his salary will go up over time (he will be paid less in BTC, same value). It's not about dollars vs BTC, it's about value. You are seeing this from the perspective of a super early adopter, who's sitting in thousands of coins. The reality is most people won't be able to afford it.

The merchant gains absolutely nothing. No "stability", no "network security", not anything that you have mentioned.
It's not going to happen, and it's sad to see people pulling things out of their ass trying to give legitimacy to the hundreds of copycoins that have spawned since Bitcoin, just because they have "invested" (or gambled) in them and want to make some easy money (now that the superiority of BTC vs fiat has become obvious to them).

If the website randomly serves you bad code, it can obviously as well serve you the checksum for that bad code instead of the checksum for the good code. You need to get the checksum via a different channel, to make sure it's the same everyone else is receiving and is for the code that has been reviewed by others.
Other websites give you the code and the checksum in the same page because you usually trust them, and you just want to verify that the code hasn't been modified by a man in the middle or by cosmic radiation.

You can't make this thought experiment about what would happen if people stopped believing in the USD if you start by saying "People won't stop believing in the USD...".
That kind of law has already been used and failed every time. The government can't do this, the market forces will always be stronger. Nobody will work for free, and nobody will give something with real value in exchange for a promise that won't be kept.
Check out what happened in every country with hyperinflation. The government tried to force people into using the currency, businesses closed, importations were halted, gas, food and water stopped flowing, so suddenly they became more valuable than any amount of local currency. People robbed supermarkets and stocked supplies. Riots everywhere. No laws can stop that. Finally, a new government is put in place, tells the truth that everybody already knows: "the old currency is shit", issues a new currency and only prints the right amount (for a while). Rince and repeat.

Bitcoin is nothing like the lottery, you have a very real chance here. Besides, it is already useful *today*.

That's absolutely wrong, you are not sending all that data with every request. Else tell me what's the name of the header in which your browser sends the list of all the plugins you are using. That data is gathered using Javascript, Actionscript, etc. No browser will ever send that kind of data by default.

Weren't you saying that the wealth it costs is the same, and it was just a limitation in our minds? LOL! What an idiot.

Trezor costs more than a cheap laptop and it's a fucking pre-order. They need to get their act together.

Aren't you afraid of bit rot? Better download [Armory]( and start using it.

You can criticize Alexa all you want, but being in the top 20 is no joke. Besides I haven't said the site was good, just good news for Bitcoin because it's a lot of exposure.

- Don't install the Java plugin in your browser, check that it isn't installed.
- Don't visit random bitcoin websites with the same machine you use for bitcoin
- Don't use paper wallets before reading this: 
- Use [cold storage]( for your savings wallet. Anything else is unacceptable risk.

All of them. Do you even know Bitcoin's advantages?

Why not just use Armory or Electrum?

And how is that related to creating more secure Bitcoin wallets? Why not say instead "Alan Reiner, I love you!"? You guys are freaking retarded.

The only ones who are anti-competition are the Litecoin bagholders, they are [really scared]( of altcoins, because they are exactly the same as Litecoin.

It wasn't a fail, they faked it. They stole users' funds.

I don't know, but he mined them, he did all the work. Are you going to complain about Gavin's coins too? What about the other early adopters? Besides, if Satoshi is alive and has those coins, I think he deserves to do whatever he wants with them. I mean he created the whole thing, for Christ's sake, no one forced us to use Bitcoin, and he didn't even premine. Besides, he probably doesn't even care about money, he has never even touched any of those coins, and they are already worth almost a billion.

Yes, it's a statistical trick based on probability distribution. Like you said, it lowers the chance of maximum profit, but also lowers the risk of maximum loss. Overall, if you carefully picked your investments, you will have a pretty good chance of having a decent profit, and a very small chance of losing everything.
I didn't know such thing as "portfolio theory" existed, I will look into that.

Wow thanks!

They will fire him for spending his money? I don't think so. Besides he didn't ask about spending "ALL" his money. He specifically asked how much was enough.

How is debating about the trustworthiness of the Bitcoin foundation members or someone with a very influential position in the Bitcoin world childish?

Relevant username? You seem to be in The (Tulip) Mania, also known as Litecoin.

I haven't said it creates wealth. I'm saying wealth can be created by other means, and since there is a fixed supply of Bitcoin, they can increase in value, and I can become wealthier just by holding on to my Bitcoin, without necessarily reducing the wealth of others.
About the dark spiral of death, we'll see. So far we have trusted mainstream economists, and how did that work out? Bitcoin is a fantastic experiment, and worst case scenario, we will learn a lot. Best case we will enter a new level of civilization.

Hehe, agreed. The % of people here that doesn't really understand Bitcoin has gone through the roof. To them, talking bad about it is "realistic", because else it would be too good to be true and they wouldn't feel comfortable.

Use Armory or Electrum (with cold storage if possible), anything else is unacceptable risk.

Bitcoin no, Litecoin yes. Have you seen the market caps of the other trashcoins recently? They are in the millions scale, just like Litecoin. Bitcoin is in the billions.

For some reason they think they are contributing to Bitcoin by fixing the prices in Bitcoin. They are insane.
