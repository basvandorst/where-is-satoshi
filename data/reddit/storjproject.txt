Well for starters, with Dropbox, you pay for a set plan (ex. $99 for 100GB). Storj differs from Dropbox in that you pay for what you use on the network while also being immensely cheaper per GB. Also, encrypting and then putting on Dropbox is a two-step process while Storj does it all together.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:55:22
So you are referencing what is known as a sybil redundancy attack.  
Basically a person is attempting to pretend that they hae multiple redundant copies of a chunk when they really only have one.  
What we do is make each redundant copy uniquely encrypted. Therefore, an attacker will not be able to pass the heartbeats (challenges) unless they actually have all of the redundant copies. Even if the file is one that is publicly shared and the hash and key are known, each time a check is sent to the network, a seed will be added.  This creates a unique challenge that is verified by the owner of the file, so a payment will only go out to the appropriate locations storing the files.  This also decreases the incentive to cheat because you would be filling your space with useless redundant copies -- essentially reducing your ability to earn money.

Greetings! Storj's Metadisk app is currently in its beta and DriveMiner is going to be open for testing very soon. All of our code up to this point is available on our [GitHub page]( Cheers!
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:15:17
Hello,  
  
It's a common misconception that Storj is *just* a Dropbox alternative. Metadisk, our file-sharing application, is just one of the many numerous potential uses of Storj. Storj is a platform that allows the creation of decentralized applications on top of the network. MaidSafe and Storj are similar in the sense that we're trying to accomplish the same thing, but in a different way.  
  
  
Edit: Our new blog post: 
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:48:18
Our tech specs and technologies being used can be explained in our [github](
And by business plan do you our entire outlook or more so what we are doing right now on the inside/ team side of Storj?
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:33:19
But making a copy of the same file will not make it so you can prove you have more redundancy - the network knows where the file was sent. We perform a check of the file to make sure it is intact. Just because you passed the challenge 1,000,000,000,000 times on your hard drive does not entitle you to 10000,000,000,000 payments
@_date: 2014-12-09 00:43:22
SJCX is a counterparty asset.
Your attack scenario is addressed in section 8.4 of the paper

by communicating we mean that we have been talking to the Maidsafe devs quite a bit and have agreed we do not want competition. We both want to reach de centralize the internet, but we are approaching it in very different ways. 
We currently do no even work with Maidsafe but we do hope that we both are successful because we both want to see each other succeed.
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:13:27
I think many readers of this piece would be quite interested in Storj as well! :)  
Storj is a decentralized cloud storage platform where users are able to rent out their excess hard drive space to the network and in return will be paid in cryptocurrency. Storj also facilitates the creation of decentralized applications - which we have already begun to see basic demos for!  
  
You can find our website [here]( our forums [here]( and our GitHub page [here]( Cheers! :) 
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:31:36
Storj would have to be. Dropbox has many costs they have to factor in their price before even trying to make a profit such as employee salary, office space, and heating/cooling. You can read more in this about it in [this]( blog post. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:34:37
There is literally no possible way for a host to be able to know what is being stored with them. LE could take their hard drive but even they wouldn't be able to figure out what's on it. The only person that could be held liable is the person storing the data (i.e. the only person who can actually see/use the file).  
  
Storj does not hold the private keys. The only person who has access to the keys is the user storing the data.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:20:27
Is your concern that the network would create all 3 redundant copies of every chunk on one persons hard drive?
Using random distribution to distribute the files would make these extremely unlikely that every chunk of a file and every redundant copy of each chunk would be sent to one person. They could make copies of them themselves but this would be pointless for the person
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:40:21
A lot of these projects like ours aren't worried about making people money - we're all more focused on creating innovative, new platforms and services for people. For example, Storj is aimming to create a completely trustless cloud storage platform that sets a new standard for the industry and we highly support other similar projects like Sia and MaidSafe. We're not doing it for ourselves or to make anybody money, we're doing it because of what Storj and other projects mean for the future. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:35:33
Right now it will be up to the user to manage the keys to their libraries.  
If you loose them there will be no retrieving them.  If you lost the private keys to your bitcoin wallet you wouldn't get them back.
@_date: 2014-08-16 14:04:40
Would just like to make clear that we are not in competition with MaidSafe; we do not believe in competition.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:55:04
Your SJCX will be sent once your Bitcoin transaction to the crowdsale address has been confirmed on the network. Your SJCX will be sent to the address you sent BTC from and will show up in Counterwallet. Thanks for participating. :)

@_date: 2014-07-18 19:53:15
If you participate in the crowdsale you will get the first access to Metadisk.
We will come out with exact dates soon!
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:24:47
Our code would try to get as much of the file as it can from the one with the 100 up/down in order to get you your file as fast as possible.
But like you said that is a hypothetical situation :)
We will have thousands of nodes even at the launch of Storj, and if you look at the demographic of many of our pledged users they are usually hooked up to some pretty fast internet speeds so you will get your file faster than any other cloud service, that's our promise :)
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:26:41
As stated during the video this is a very early version of Metadisk,  there are many changes coming in the future.  Join us on the forums at storjtalk.org here we have discussed the current features and current operation of the demo.  
For someone to access your files in your library they would need to at this time have your hash+key for the individual file.  However in discussions on the forums we have recommend that you encrypt your data before uploading if you consider it sensitive.
Several people have developed applications to work on top of it already!
you can see some of them on the forums or develop something yourself to collect a 10,000 SJCX bounty!
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:38:02
Yes, you will be able to set the redundancy that your data is stored at.
@_date: 2014-09-01 05:03:27
Well there's a use case we never thought of!
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:43:54
Not sure about MaidSafe, but Storj does this because there will be data stored on the Storjcoin blockchain. While it isn't a large amount of data (i.e. just the metadata that points to where data is being stored(cuts down on the blockchain bloat)), we felt as though our own cryptocurrency with its own blockchain would give us the most ability for change and ease of use. That being said, if sidechains or treechains ever become a thing, we plan on integrating back into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-26 18:35:34
MaidSafe and Storj are achieving the same thing but in a different way. Storj is *not* just a Dropbox alternative - it is a platform for a decentralized applications to run on the Storj network and can end up acting as a decentralized internet.
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:08:18
Our software checks to make sure that each piece is present constantly.
By default there are 2 other of the same pieces stored somewhere else on the network.
If Storj detects that one piece has been edited, hacked, or disappeared it automatically makes a new copy from the other 2 and backs it up somewhere else.
That make sense?
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:41:19
Storjcoin X (SJCX) runs on the Counterparty protocol. Many Bitcoiners do not realize that while SJCX runs on the Counterparty protocol, Counterparty is really just an "extension" of the Bitcoin protocol that allows you to do a lot more with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:56:51
As stated maidsafe does not use "blockchain" storj however utilizes the blockchain
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:42:39

Cheers! 
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:45:30
With Storj, it is not currently possible to do what we are doing with Bitcoin. We are using the blockchain as a store of metadata (i.e. 'pointers' to where data is held on the network), and as of right now, Bitcoin's blockchain is not able to carry that amount of information. We would be happy to reintegrate back into Bitcoin should treechains or sidechains come to fruition. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:29:49
I know I'm excited. ;)
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:29:49
two weeks not very long, we have to respond to over 500 responses regarding the crowdsale and everyone's questions regarding it.
People  don't have to give anymore funds if they want, the crowdsale's purpose was to help further the developement.
Yes, there are technical questions, a lot of them. Instead of giving a sub par answer here and then trying to answer that same question in a few dozen other places we believe it would be far more effective to just compile everything in one place, present that and then take more questions you have.
Shawn is also planning on doing an AMA to personally answer everything you have ask.
We are sorry we  don't have anything to post "publicly for all to see, now!" but we will be working on doing so as soon as we possibly can.

@_date: 2014-07-14 14:40:00
Storj and Maidsafe are separate projects.  We do communicate with one another though, and Storj intends to integrate and collaborate once the SAFE network launches.
Even if MaidSafe flops, Storj will still work and provide access to a decentralized cloud.  We've even got our first application, Metadisk, up and running already.  If you participate in the crowdsale, you'll be receiving Storjcoin (which can be used to purchase bandwidth/storage once DriveMiner launches) and early access to DriveMiner.  The crowdsale will be ongoing past July 15th for at least 30 days or until we raise 10,000 BTC, so you have some time to do a little more research and make your decision :)
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:11:07
With many people asking technical questions Storj is working on compiling a list of all the questions and we will release a FAQ that will hopefully answer most of your questions.
Super3 (Shawn, the founder) has said that we can put a node out just to show people that we have working software.  
Again, the point of a crowdsale is not to just pay into a company, we wanted to host a crowdsale in order to help further our development and provide funds to have new devs come in and help with our new apps and ideas that we have.
Again, Super3 will be posting the new Whitepaper soon that will be far more up to date and relevant to many of your questions. The FAQ will hopefully be posted soon as we compile many of your questions.
Thank you for your support

@_date: 2014-07-18 23:42:28
Exactly right.
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:53:22
Yes but keep in mind you won't get paid for simply providing the space. You will get paid for utilized space.

We appreciate the support! :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:44:34
Here is a brief overview of the safety:
Storj takes your file and shreds it, putting each part somewhere. Each of those parts are constantly being checked by Storj and making sure they are not being edited or are stolen. If anything happens to your file it is immediately backed up to another node (user) and will be constantly checked there. On top of all this there are three levels of encryption so even getting far enough in to even do anything stated above is is near impossible.
If you have any further questions about the actual security of Storj feel free to let us know or even PM u/Super3 as he will be able to go further in depth. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:19:23
My apologies, thought you wanted the code in general. 
You are correct that this specific code is being worked on and the crowdsale funds will allow us to hire more devs to speed up this process.

@_date: 2014-08-26 15:57:04
Hello there!  
   
Simply encrypting a file and putting a file on the cloud would still cost the users a *lot* more money compared to hosting it on the Storj network. You make the claim that hard drives are getting cheaper and cheaper, which is definitely true, but the cloud storage market is still a $150 **b**illion industry, so people still definitely have a need for the cloud and will for years and years to come. So why wouldn't they prefer a *much* cheaper cloud?
  
One thing that Storj does is it takes both storage *and* bandwidth into account. You will end up paying a little more for better bandwidth, but this cuts back on things like slow download speeds, so you don't have to worry about transferring a large file around. 
  
Using a blockchain-based system makes it truly decentralized. The blockchain acts as a store for the metadata as opposed to us having some central server storing all of the data or the metadata so the network does not need to rely on any centralized sources. We actually planned on using Bitcoin and its blockchain, but Bitcoin is not able to fit the amount of metadata we need it to on its blockchain. That being said, we have said many, many times that we would be happy to integrate back into Bitcoin once sidechains or treechains come to fruition. As for the time being, it is **not** possible.  
  
Keep in mind that Storj is not just a Dropbox alternative. While that is one of its uses, Storj is also a platform for the creation of decentralized applications on top of the network.
  
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:22:26
Keep in mind that SJCX can't be heavily used yet. Once the network goes live publicly, SJCX will have a lot more demand.  
 
We want to stress that no one should have felt or feel pressured to participate in the crowdsale - only send BTC that wouldn't impose any hardships on you in chance you don't make a profit. We do NOT guarantee profit of any kind; we provide information, benefits of Storj, and the actual product while the individual decides for themselves whether they would like to participate in the crowdsale. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:21:28
What questions would you like answered? We will happily address any questions or concerns you have.

250k TB is not what we expect to get by the end of the crowdsale.
But, if you look at the potential for a lot of people giving out a small amount of storage then it becomes more realistic. 
Also, with the addition of the people that have huge 50TB towers the numbers start to expand.
But yes, that is a very "high end" number that we hope to reach, not a number we expect in the next 30 days.
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:02:49
We are not just frontend. Check out our [GitHub](
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:11:16
Hello! Thanks for the concerns. 
Our first app, Metadisk, is currently in its beta stage and can be tested by crowdsale participators and our DriveMiner application is going to be released very soon. That being, we definitely have an existing service and, therefore, are out of the concept and theory stage for the most part.  
  
As for your question about file encryption: traditional cloud storage providers are free to use, steal, manipulate, and sell any of your information as they please. This becomes impossible on Storj because it allows you to encrypt your files before they are uploaded and lets you, the file owner, be the only one holding the private keys to your data. 
 
The reasoning behind why someone isn't going out and buying a hard drive instead of using Storj is the same reason that cloud storage is already a $120 billion industry today. For most people, Storj provides a cheaper, more secure, and safer alternative to traditional cloud storage providers without you having to carry a hard drive around everywhere.
 
We completely understand that there are going to be problems with Storj at the beginning -- we won't deny that. All cryptocurrency/decentralized/etc networks have their fair share of problems; even Bitcoin has problems. That being said, we are continually working on Storj using feedback from testers in order to create a system that works well and is easily accessible by all people. We have been adding more people to the team, brainstorming new ideas/features, and reaching out to other projects as well in order to collectively grow the Storj ecosystem. 
 
If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask! Cheers. :)
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:04:27

@_date: 2014-12-12 22:06:13
for Storj, we he have a specific use case for Storjcoin,  our goal is not to have merchants accept SJCX for other goods,  SJCX is for purchases storage space on our network.  So in that sense we are different than the altcoins the other poster has discussed.  We are not attempting to replace bitcoin or be better than bitcoin,  we are doing something very different.
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:23:57
You actually  don't need any storage to participate, participating in the crowdsale gives you X amount of Storjcoin and then you use that to pay for the amount of space you need to use in the cloud.
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:01:58
Good questions.  
  
We had no way to predict what the price per GB would be, though the numbers we used were much lower than iCloud, Dropbox, etc. The numbers we used for SJCX --&gt; BTC were arbitrary for the most part because only the market can decide how much a SJCX is really worth along with how much the network is worth. Keep in mind that at current crowdsale prices, the SJCX market cap would not be over $10,000,000.  
  
Contributing to any crowdsale can have its share of concerns -- what if I don't make a good return? What if the project doesn't work out? What if it's really a scam? Questions like those. We are being as transparent and open as possible with our work, finances, and questions in order to subdue many fears that people may have. While we are constantly working in order to achieve a great end product, we must stress that we do not guarantee any kind of return or profit from participating in the crowdsale.  
  
It's very unlikely that many 'big' players would create a huge setup for Storj because they are not guaranteed people storing on their setup. There would be many smaller players with enough storage for user data and similar, if not better, bandwidth. Even if these large players were to step in, there are still incentives for people storing data: encryption (as you mentioned) but then Storj would still be exponentially cheaper than traditional cloud storage providers. Also, because of redundancy, there isn't any way one or two big setups would be able to hog the network.  
  
Storj decided to go with SJCX as opposed to Bitcoin because the 40 byte limit on Bitcoin isn't enough for what Storj will need. SJCX's blockchain will be a store for metadata (i.e. 'pointers' for where data is being held over the network). If sidechains or treechains ever become a thing, we will readily integrate back into Bitcoin.
 
We're happy to provide any information you would like and our revised whitepaper will be released soon.
@_date: 2014-09-01 13:17:52
The SJCX blockchain will act as a store of metadata (i.e. pointers to where data is held on the network).

No, there is no lower or upper limit.
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:54:45
I agree that many people are moving towards the SSD's because they are dropping in price almost as fast as HDD. But I personally think that HDD will stick around for a bit as they will become dirt cheap and are not bad for just file storage that doesn't need extreme read/ write speeds.
Secondly, we  don't "expect" anything. Whatever we get, we will work with. But to give a true "answer"....
Before the crowdsale we had a pledge post on the forum and I believe that is north of 1 PB an has not been updated in a while. So I will put the number 25 PB as a good goal to reach for in 30 days. Again, this can differ in either direction.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:01:24
Correct! Storjcoin X (SJCX) is a Counterparty asset.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:34:59
Well if anything illegal is uploaded nether Storj or the user that is hosting part of the file will be held accountable.
Just like any other cloud service we are just  the facilitator so the user that uploaded it will be punished.
The persons that are hosting the different parts of it will never know what they are hosting so they can not be hurt by another's actions.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:32:32
We are working on a true break down of what we plan to do right now with the funds.
But for now I can tell you a bit about it:
A lot of the funding will be going into paying off many of the initial costs for Storj, such as social media fees, certain software fees, and paying for other expenses it took to get Storj off the ground.
Also, we need to pay many of our core/ full time devs that have devoted almost all of their time to getting the main apps off the ground. 
Conference and travel fees will also be paid off as many people have traveled to various conferences to get Storj going.
Like I said we will be getting a better break down out soon.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:01:33
You are not downloading from one node.
It is much like the torrenting network where you download from many different places, they are all feeding into your download so it will download as fast as your internet connection is.
And each node isn't uploading your entire file, everyone is uploading a small portion of it so it is even faster because they don't have to upload one big file.
That answer your question?
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:16:34
That is what we are hoping for ;)
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:33:42
Thank you!

Storj is trying to keep everything together, using another currency would split up the main purpose of Storj.
The way I look at from a economy side is sort of a supply and demand.  We will have our own currency to keep everything in order and will have people coming and going and keeping it all "in house" will be better in the end. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:11:47
Oops. :)  
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:49:45
This is a very early version of Metadisk. Currently, encryption is done server-side and will continue to be done so until DriveShare is released and other users are able to host data. One of our goals is to have encryption done client-side.
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:37:58
If you look in the crowdsale terms and conditions it will lay it out better: 
We will be opening our books so you can see exact numbers once the crowdsale gets going and our main devs get back from conferences and are able to devote more time to the financial part of Storj.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:57:06

The chances that three nodes turn off all at the same time that just so happen to have the three copies of a file is *extremely* unlikely. Not to mention it wouldn't be in a node owner's best interest to turn their node off -- they would stop making money.

Yes. Your file is stored at a redundancy that you set to minimize chances of loss. They are also encrypted before being sent out so no one is able to view, copy, steal, or modify your data.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:01:37
Our video will explain this as well but you will be connecting to many users so while one may have poor upload speed the others that are feeding into your download will make up for the slower users.

The beta for our first app, Metadisk, has been out for a bit now.  You can join by heading over to the forums at 
Since everything we're working on is open source, it's entirely possible to include a recommendation algorithm in the future on top of the Storj platform.  The moon is the limit :)
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:10:23
If you would like to see one of our apps in action you can try it out here: 
And we are allowing access to everyone, you can see our code, you will be seeing our numbers once the crowdsale is going and our devs get back from the Chicago Conference.
If you mean "available for anyone" in terms of wanting to contribute and help out we would love to have you on board and we welcome anyone that would like to help.
And the entire point for a crowdsale is to raise money for further development. Many of the Kickstarter campaigns don't have a working prototype and are just in the '"idea" phase.
We are sorry that you did not like our crowdsale but if you would like to discuss more about it or let us know what we can do better we would love to hear from you.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:44:46
The crowdsale address will be posted this week. Specific details will be sent out to our newsletter subscribers and will be posted on the crowdsale webpage (which goes live tomorrow) and the [forums]( By participating in the crowdsale, you're purchasing Storjcoin X, and if/when they're added to an exchange you'll be able to buy them from other users there as well. What can we do to keep you more informed?
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:26:27
We are definitely working hard to get a working prototype of DriveShare out as soon as possible!
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:58:34
If you fall into one of these groups you will get to start as each group begins otherwise you will have to wait for the fully open service
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:28:54
Just make sure you look into the Terms and Conditions pdf just to make sure you  don't have any surprises. 
Many of the people that are calling Storj a scam have not really looked into what we have to offer and we think if you really do your research, you will find that we are trying to help out everyone in the end.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:02:32
It will work as the currency of Storj.
So you get coins for renting out your space and you pay in order to use space.
It is unlike Dropbox or Google where you pay for set amount (5,10, 100GB) you pay for what you use!
Also, SJCX will also differ in value much like current coins based on the demand/ supply of the users and current storage. If you would like to know more of the "finance" side of Storj please PM us and we would love to explain it further.
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:32:11
Can you explain further?
We are giving you the first access to the software and you now have the currency of Storj that will allow you to access our decentralized cloud.
Was it the way it was presented or just  the questions that came with it?
We understand that it was not perfect but we would love some more feedback!
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:30:57
I appologize I meant section 8.5
8.5 Hostage Byte
The hostage byte attack was first described by Vitalik Buterin, in which a malicious farmer transfers data to a client but holds the last piece of data hostage for a higher payment [3]. We address this with our erasure encoding scheme, so that the shards required to reassemble the file are not linear. As long as the client keeps the bounds of its erasure encoding a secret, the malicious farmer cannot know what the last byte is.
in addition to this the missing shard could be retrieved from one of the other redundant nodes.
SJCX is a counter party asset there are 500,000,000 total tokens and the asset is locked, the tokens were issued through a crowdsale held in july.   may give you some isight
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:14:14
The idea that Storj is just cloud storage is a misconception. Storj enables users to build decentralized applications like video players (think something like Youtube) and image viewer (something like Imgur) among many other possibilites.
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:32:08
You could.  The profitability of that may be questionable.
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:21:17
You can try it out right now! node1.metadisk.org 
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:30:05
The software itself will accept Storjcoin *&amp;* Bitcoin. We are also looking into other forms of payment like USD and Peercoin.  
  
The reason Storjcoin is being used as the main cryptocurrency for the network is because we will be using its blockchain as a store of metadata. This will cut back on blockchain bloat while still having information stored on it.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:27:31
All the code that we work on for Storj is in this link:

Haha appreciate the support!
If we can help answer anything else please let us know!

Yes this is the official storj reddit account.  As posted below by the community Vice President we believe in collaboration rather than competition.

When did you send in Bitcoin? And did you receive SJCX in the wallet you sent BTC from?
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:57:01
What questions do you have that were not answered in chapter 7 rewards 
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:02:09
Users will need to pay for space on the network in sjcx.   Now if nobody uploads anything ever of course nobody will ever get paid.
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:52:48
The calculator is showing prices if you got paid what other providers charge.
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:33:10
It really depends on the market value of Storjcoin at a certain point.
You can look at it almost as a supply/ demand economy. 
If we have a lot of users that are just pouring storage into Storj and aren't using it too much to actually store data then the value of SJCX will obviously go down because there is much more supply.
Now lets say we have a large number of users storing large RAW files or movies or even engineering/ autocad files, and not too many that are providing tons of space. Then the value will go up because people will want to pay more to get space.
Now again, These costs will never get near the cost of Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud because we have the potential to have thousands of people giving extra space.
Also, your income depends on your upload speed because that means you are a node that can help out downloaders much faster.
So I can't give you a "number" but I hope that helps a bit more in explaining the factors that feed into the price.
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:41:25
    I think shawn addressed many of these in a reply to your other comments
@_date: 2014-12-15 12:03:05
We are developing a decentralized cloud network.  Built in functinality will allow you to share the "keys" to your file with someone else.  However we do not support distribution of illegal content.  See our blog post 
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:19:35
The wallet has to be one that is listed in the terms, since Storj will automatically send you back Storjcoin X.
It is easiest to set up a counterparty wallet and have the funds transfered into there.
Does that work for you?
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:26:40

@_date: 2014-07-20 13:17:14
As far as I know, Freenet is purely a communication software.
We are a data storage and cloud software. 
And in the video it has a simple description of the upload/ download speed answer we have. If one node is slow, the other nodes will make up for it because.
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:20:15
We sure hope so!
Thanks for your contribution and we hope you love Storj!
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:13:26
Let us know if you have anymore questions.
If you become more interested be sure to check around the storj forum and the subreddit to see what we are up to!
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:58:26
Just to be clear: we did not issue stocks, shares, or any kind of equity. SJCX is just a token and does **not** represent stake in Storj, the software, or the team. We want to stress this point!  
  
That being said, we used the service [Vennd]( (with Counterparty) and they did a very good job - we definitely recommend them! :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:43:41
The price would change depending on your redundancy but storing at 3x redundancy is really all you need. Regardless, it is still exponentially cheaper than traditional cloud storage providers.
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:13:32
Not necessarily,  a brief summary is as follows.
User A uploads a file to the network.  It is encrypted then broken up into a bunch of "shards" of a file.  These are then distributed to everyone in redundancy.  
So for an arbitrary example I upload 100  MB file and we use a shard size of 1 MB and a redundancy of 3. So now we distribute these shards to 300 farmers.  
The uploader pays a small fee to each farmer for the upload then a small microtransaction to each at each heartbeat to verify the integrity of the file. Then again when retrieving the file etc.
The values of these transaction are not yet known and will be variable as the market changes.  Our test net will help us determine exactly how often we need to do these transactions as well.
So it may take some time for your hdd to actually be full depending on network utilization.
@_date: 2014-08-13 06:32:38
And there is nothing wrong with that. We can completely understand why someone would be.
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:49:01
It's also best to keep in mind that what we (Storj) are doing with Storjcoin X isn't possible with Bitcoin. We would be more than happy to integrate back into Bitcoin if sidechains or treechains became a thing. Cheers! :)
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:36:38
Sorry hit submit too quickly.  Yes you will be able to set your redundancy requirements for your files.  Shard size requirements are something we are looking at with the test net over the next few months
@_date: 2014-08-13 05:35:25
The Metadisk whitepaper can be downloaded [here]( and the Storj whitepaper is being worked on as we speak.

Hi there!  
   
Here's a quick rundown: our crowdsale started on July 18th and ended August 18th (9 days ago). During that period, users contributed BTC and in return will be able to be the first to use Metadisk and DriveShare as they are released. Also, Storjcoin X (SJCX) was sent to the addresses that participated proportional to how much BTC they sent in.
  
SJCX is a token created on top of the Counterparty protocol which is an extension of the Bitcoin protocol. That being, there is no mining or staking involved. There are a set number of SJCX (500,000,000). These coins have been distributed to everyone who participated in the crowdsale and pretty much all of the coins generated after the sale and not bought will be put under a time lock transaction as to quell fears of tampering or shady actions potentially being done with them. We are as transparent as possible and we make sure we have open books.
