Where are the Bittrex shills now?  And, why is Bittrex trying to delete their Reddit and Bitcointalk accounts?  Well, I don't live too far from where they are based and my thoughts are getting very dark on this subject ---&gt; I hate being ripped off!

Nice contribution....CommerceBlock!

Bullish? A mad bull in a china shop?  I guess it sums up the charts for the weekend.  What gets me is how do we get all these "official" leaks on a **weekend**?....Why not Thursday or Friday when official business is open?

You've been warned.  When they start coming up with excuses to hold our funds, it is a sign that there's a problem.  My account WAS verified under their own terms with public records search, but now they are not honoring those terms.  Something is wrong, guaranteed!  Same thing happened at Cryptsy and nobody wanted to listen.

I just withdrew a few days ago....and been trading with them for a few years. I just deposited, made a trade, and tried to withdraw but my withdrawal was refused....they shouldn't accept a deposit if they're not going to honor a withdrawal....period!

No, I don't think my withdrawal is causing them stress.  I think that they have issues they are not explaining to the public.  And, yes, I do know what the limits are because I have been using them for several years. In fact, I just made a similar withdrawal on the 15th of November without any problems.  When an exchange starts demonstrating an unwillingness to honor withdrawals, while being unresponsive to support inquiries, it is an indicator that they have liquidity issues ---&gt; this happens every time an exchange goes under!

Just look at their twitter today....all complaints about not being able to withdraw! 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:39:28
Yes, but I keep my transactions below 100 bitcoin a day so I shouldn't have had to upload them: "Enhanced accounts can withdrawal up to 100 BTC per day."  I use bitcoin because it is pseudoanonymous; otherwise, I would just use USD because it is insured against this type of theft.
I uploaded everything but still no response!

I was verified a few years ago, and have been trading there routinely ---&gt; something is off with this exchange right now, guaranteed!

United States....Bittrex is acting very strange for sure....maybe they are working with the U.S. government in preparation to start seizing funds or to coordinate a major sweep.....Either way, I'd run far from Bittrex....start mixing....there may be some deep Blockchain Analytic investigations taking place.

Polo (Poloniex) in the United States....but I would find a "decentralized" exchange that doesn't have control over your private keys because these "centralized" exchanges routinely go under and take your funds with them.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:11:37
Huge red flags! Their email account is kicking back inquiries too....support isn't responding....something very serious is in the works here, guaranteed!
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:24:48
How many times must we verify our account?  Do they do this every time they're "short" of funds and need to wait for the deposits to catch up to the withdrawals before they honor our requests?
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:13:19
Nope....they are running now!
 
Thank you for emailing me.  I read every email that is sent but depending on my schedule, I may not be able to respond right away. 
 
I won't be able to answer any support requests sent to me. If you have a support request, please file a ticket at support.bittrex.com. 
 
Unfortunately, we've run out of invites for our slack and are exploring options for real time chat support.
 
Thanks again,

Their platform would not accept the submission of the BACK of my ID. So, I attached all my documents in the email and this was their final response before going dark again:
I apologize again that you are having an issue.  The quickest way to be able to withdrawal is to follow the enhanced verification instructions and upload your documents as requested.  Should you refuse that process, it may take several weeks before your identification can be manually verified by a 3rd party, as Bittrex does not verify documents manually and must have experts in this field perform the verification.
Please let me know how you want to proceed.
Thank you,
Ryan @ Bittrex"
Therefore, I submitted one of these:   And, one of these:    They are playing games to buy time....I went through this with Cryptsy while they "bleached" their servers.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:12:27
F**k you! Give me my money back!
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:39:59
Update: 
I just gave them everything I could and they still wont let me withdraw ---&gt; first I tried to upgrade to basic (which I already had but they changed it yesterday day to "new") and it said that it failed (gave my SSI number and everything)!  So, I went ahead and uploaded my state identification card and selfie....and still nothing ----&gt; I am done ---&gt; there is something suspicious going on here, guaranteed!

I just read the comments here.  I didn't see any mention of the USB drive Gavin described as being a part of the proof presented to him.  I don't think the signature was ever broadcast over the internet....went from CW machine to USB drive, from USB drive to the virgin machine.  That's part of Gavin's description.  The USB drive seems like a possible point of failure....a broken chain of evidence.  Right?

Serious? Do you want the coin or the keys? Because I just happen to know somebody with a dozen or so public keys in the top 100 blocks.  I'll escrow for 2% commission.  Push the coin to me now, and I'll link you up!  You have to act quickly though because there's another guy ahead of who's just waiting to get approval from his trust.
