It 100000% is and you can especially see this in the pump of another coin the other day, Tron, where the price rose over 500% over a product most people would value at 1 million on a good day (cryptopuppies, kind of like a shitty basic app game). The coin reached a market cap of 19 billion. The thing is, most people realize it's a bubble but no one cares as they're making money rn. I guess when the bubble bursts everyone's hoping they won't be the ones left holding the bag of shitty coins.

No one needs to shill for ETH. 
2nd highest mcap and most projects on the remaining 100 are built on ETH.

It's a dank meme why not

Yep and just ignore the first line of the whitepaper lol

Would you say average people right now are the ones running the nodes or the enthusiasts and the miners?

Yessss finally some video cards will be on the market
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:12:42
Wouldnt that still make it around 1TB if they were 8mb blocks?
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:23:34
And you're sure it's not because the price of BTC stopped climbing exponentially and people's opinions are changing?
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:48:58
You're drawing up a huge backstory for a one line one panel fictional character.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:45:13
(Am ignorant) what role does block size play in decentralization?
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:23:20
... Not feasible for the average person to have 1TB of storage? Lmao
@_date: 2018-01-02 09:20:03
IMO it would skyrocket.
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:13:39
But we're stuck because transaction fees are too high and confirmations too long so we can't use it as currency until LN or something is here. Wat do
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:30:47
Idk the people who took out mortgages at ATH when the media is telling them they can make so much money too 
...it's like should we feel bad forb people that do what th media tells them ? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:36:24
As long as it's not a large part of their portfolio, like 5% max depending on the person, not a problem IMO.

He hasn't made it yet because he has 20 kids
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:43:46
How big is the current BTC blockchain and how large would it be if it was 8mb?
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:20:17
IDK about Authy but your google authenticator isn't saved to a cloud but your phone.
Which is why you're screwed if you lose your phone lol

No it's not I said no one uses it for everyday purchases. Plenty of people use it as an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:39:29
Agreed. That's extremely messed up. Even though bitcoin gold is a scam coin, it's in my wallet on one of my exchanges and I don't expect them to sell for me.
They essentially bought all the user's bitcoin cash and paid them at current value.
If I have money in some stupid shit wallstreetbets got me in to, I still expect to be able to sell and buy it when I want, not randomly have it swapped in to AAPL
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:05:39
Currently little to no one is using bitcoin for everyday purchases since the fees are far too high.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:24:26
No shit.
That doesn't mean they just randomly trade for you. 
I'm saying what BitMex did was unethical and everyone using it should leave.

No sleeping the rest of the world is waking up here we go
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:34:20
That's...kind of scary

Seems like quite the pyramid

He is probably a millionaire many times over already lol.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:17:53
Do people fall for these...idk what to even call them? If someone is relatively less wanky and keeps a straightforward profile, will they be glossed over?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:06
OH MY GOD THERE'S A FIRE
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:26:10
That giant candle doesn't ring the alarm for anyone else? That's some market manipulation or a crazy whale.

Everyone makes money in a bull market
How much are they making now?
Only winners report back
People don't talk about losses
And so on
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:24:11
Once people realize the overpriced GPUs they bought won't break even they'll probably sell...but again there's mass delusion going on there too
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:39:23
? Are you a teenager
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:58:35
I mean everyone has to retire eventually. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:44:45
Except no one would buy that many for 1$ thus, excess supply, less demand, price goes down until the market puts the coin at its true value.
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:24:46
? What does that have to do with what I said. You can't create a trillion tokens and sell them from 1$. Price would fall and the market cap would not be 1 trillion, the price of the token will drop to 0.0000001 or whatever the market thinks they're worth and market cap will follow.
Or are you saying that market cap will be determined by the last price the token was sold out multiplied by tokens outstanding?
