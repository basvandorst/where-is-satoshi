Very nice. At first I thought he was gonna pull out his phone to check the baby monitor and end up checking BTC price instead, but this was much better.

Very rarely does littering your profile with key words work. The hiring teams I have worked with tend to prefer straight forward profiles. In my experience, the candidates who’s profiles and conversations are more straight forward tend to get hired more often. 
In terms of getting your profile noticed...hiring managers can’t sift out the fluff pretty quick when reviewing profiles, they are mainly looking at experience. Your accomplishments and specific involvement in projects should be very well articulated and easy to understand. Once in a great while some candidates may slip through and get a phone screen, but very rarely will they get farther unless they have the core skills required for the position. Most engineering teams I work with use something like coderpad during the phone screen, and can tell pretty damn quick whether or not you can code.

There are an increasing number of coding boot camps hitting the scene. Additionally, tech giants (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon) are no longer requiring CS degrees or ANY degree as long as you can get the job done. In your case, since you are transitioning professions your experience as a translator won’t carry over at all. I’m not sure which direction you are looking to take but my recommendation to you would be to BUILD something. I’ve come across a lot of people in your situation and the coding is a great first start. I would continue to learn more, but what will really make you pop is to build an app and publish it to the store. You can do this and learn at the same time and you’ll have something to show for it that will set you apart from the rest. If you are having a hard tome finding a job to start off, work with a recruiting agency (Aerotech, Robert Half, Teksystems, etc). They cost you NOTHING and will get the ball rolling for you. Hope this helps ����.

Security is bigger than ever, most companies are looking for hackers/pen testers to protect their users data. Search “hacker” or “penetration tester” or “security engineer” if you are looking for something.

I have resume reviews with hiring managers multiple times a week, so I get to hear them think out loud while reviewing resumes often. I would say if you use wrote “unemployed” without explaining the gap of employment it will most likely raise a red flag. Having the qualifications is clearly what’s most important, but if you have a break in service without an explanation concerns may arise surrounding ambition or work ethic. Even if you simply just wrote “taking the opportunity to travel the world” or anything along those lines it’s completely understandable. Big plus if you have a personal tech related project that you worked on during your gap.

"right" and "wrong" aside - why not explore better ways of doing things? While fiat currency has proved to serve its purpose throughout history and is still currently a much more functional currency, its flaws have also ruined the lives of millions of people. So I don't see BTC as a "investment cult', but rather a project to simply see if a different system can be created that may be better for the future. Does it have its flaws? Hell yes. Are there people invested in it who are ill informed and don't know what they are talking about? Yup. But this will happen anytime something new is being tested, why let it hold us back from evolving? Also important to remember that when the fiat system was in its early stages it was viewed as a scam.

Basically our dollars are loaned to us by the Federal Reserve with compounded interest, and are therefore debt notes (IOU's). The Federal Reserve is a private group of bankers (independent from any nation) who prints money and loans it to the us with compounded interest. This is the way it's worked since the Federal Reserve Act was signed in 1913. As I understand it, we are indefinitely in debt and that's the way it was designed. Also, the gold standard ended in the Nixon era. Meaning that USD isn't backed by anything. 
**TRANSLATED:** You have this group of greedy bros who saw us strugglin and decided to loan us some money under the condition that they own us forever. For some reason somebody (cough Woodrow Wilson cough) agreed to this and now we are kind of F'd forever. Fast forward to 2009 random dude/girl/group/who the F knows creates internet pesos with hopes to destroy centralized banking. To be continued....

����. As long as assholes wearing suits aren’t stealing retirement funds, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars from us and not even getting a slap on the wrist...I’m ok with with the stability ����. We should all be happy that for the first time in a looong time we have the option to store and move our money without having asshole intermediaries who have proved time and time again that they cannot be trusted. That alone is a HUGE win.

I've never thought about this but I see where you're coming from. Banking is extremely corrupt but its not simply just "systemic corruption", its a human corruption issue. Simply changing the architecture of money to a peer to peer based system will not eliminate corruption, for which money/power seems to fuel. That being said, I do think that decentralization and the elimination of intermediaries is an important step in the right direction.

Good humor but I agree about the ‘stressful’ thing. Personally I believe in Bitcoin and only put in what I can afford to lose, which allows me to be pretty emotionally detached. Wake me up when it’s 2025 ��.

10k on black followed by 2 double or nothing’s, you now have 80k. Buy 50k in BTC, put 20k in the bank and take your family on a nice vacation with the remaining 10k. You’re welcome.

For me it’s not about any of the numbers, it’s about the opportunity for decentralization

Good point. Store a big chunk away and keep the rest as “fluid” as possible (still hard for the majority of people to use this conveniently with their day to day transactions). 
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:15:48
I understand why new adopters are worried, especially those who may have put in more than they could afford to and are chasing a dream. But (1) they still have the same amount of BTC and (2) shouldn’t we be more worried about the 20T dollars of US debt?

if you want to hedge your bets against the biggest con job in US history (Federal Reserve), I recommend doing the following:
1. Buy BTC (not more than you can afford to lose)
2. Transfer your BTC to a hardware wallet
3. Lock that shit up and don't think about it for 10 years
If you don't want to buy in (maybe you don't believe in the architecture or you LOVE intermediaries stealing your money over and over again), simply don't...
Positive vibes to everybody out there!

1. BTC changes the architecture of money (HUGE need for this). There was a time and a place for traditional banks and the fiat system, over the years the system grew stale and intermediaries have proved time and time again they cannot be trusted with our money. BTC changes that system, its decentralized and gives us an opportunity to be our own bank for the first time in a looooong  time. 
2. Having a financial management system (something that keeps track of what you have and where it goes)  is something billions don't currently have access to, BTC can change this (all you need is internet access). 
3. BTC finite, which makes it inflation proof. 
Currently I'm keeping my eye on the development of the lightning network and Baakt (hopefully makes BTC much more easily usable as an every day currency)
\*For mass adoption I think we are waiting for it to be easily usable, which should happen in time. Generally speaking people don't understand it and most people won't, nor do they need to (most don't understand how the internet works but they use it anyways).

Wonder if this guy bought back in or was the type to endlessly wait for the dip 
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:57:21
IMO to say that BTC is only supposed to be used as a currency can be limiting. I also view it as an alternative store of value, a place to put your money without intermediaries (which have proven to mishandle money time and time again) getting their hands on it. Fortunately, it’s getting easier and easier to use as a currency as time goes on. The architecture of our financial system needs to be changed, I’m thinking BTC is our best bet at this point in time.
