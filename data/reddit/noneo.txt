Follow up question, can I cancel and resend? Alternatively, can I add a higher transaction fee after the fact?

That helps, thank you. Does the destination have anything to do with it? I’m sending them to Coinbase in the same way I always have. Normally it takes between 1 and 3 hours to finalize.

I think the term is 'stop-loss' but I'm probably way off.. Its a lower limit that you set your account to automatically sell if Bitcoin goes under a certain value. I bet many people that bought in at 15k-19k set a stop-loss at 15k to avoid losing all of their money.

The point is that the value didn't matter as much as the stability. Obviously the value will be less with more coins, but the entire mentality of dogecoin is to spend and receive , not hoard as an investment. A more stable currency bodes better to spending than a volatile one.

Very interesting way of looking at Bitcoin. It really is a great way for people with no/little/bad credit to purchase things online without having to run a credit check. I mean, if they have the Bitcoin to make the purchase, why should credit even come into play?

There are SO many other exchanges to use, and many of them are as advanced as stamp. Spreading usage should be like spreading hash, one should have all of the power. 
I would like to cordially invite anyone from Bitcoin to try our exchange: prelude.io 
We are constantly improving the exchange and adding more features, but we are severely lacking in BTC to USD volume and many other pairs. We would be very appreciative if some more people from this community could stop in and try us out. We know we don't have all the features yet, but we are in development with more advanced charting and trading. 
Comments and suggestions are always appreciated.

Essentially what I said. Just like credit cards aren't for some people who can't limit themselves from spending more than they can pay off.

That is a good way of looking at it. There is still a benefit: privacy, like many have already pointed out, but for very few transactions, you just won't see much of a difference.

That was *kind of* the idea. Dogecoin was intended to be spent, not hoarded (at least after the initial, haha doge funny phase wore off). By having an ever increasing number of coins, the price should stay more stable than most other currencies.

Odd that you are experiencing loading issues. Is it when navigating to prelude.io? Or some other internal page? The website actually loads very quickly for me.
EDIT: One more thing; We are moving our infrastructure this weekend to better improve performance on both our exchange and our merchant side of things. We welcome you to try us out again come the beginning of the week.

True about sending to anyone, but my grandma isn't going to be doing that. She doesn't have people on the other side of the globe. The only time money is sent by them is in a physical birthday card with a check. I don't think she is going to want to generate a paper wallet to do so :p

Absolutely, but if someone doesn't necessarily care if the merchant makes more or less profit per transaction, it isn't a benefit, it's more of a side-effect.
Now like I said in my OP, if the merchant then turned around and said they would give a discount of 3% per transaction it would be a different story, but most are not offering that.
