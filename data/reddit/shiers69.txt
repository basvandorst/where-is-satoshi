Vanguard has been pushing people over to brokerage accounts which gives access to the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). It's not a Vanguard managed account, but Vanguard will facilitate purchase of shares of it.

"We accept applicants from anywhere in the world and all we ask is that you spend 100% of your time working on your startup from Fargo, ND."
**GET BACK TO WORK**
**NO SLEEPING**
**NO EATING**
**THERE IS ONLY WORK**
j/k - This is actually a pretty neat idea.  Website needs more info though.  Who is funding this? Where in Fargo will this exist?

At this point the only reason to mine bitcoin with a GPU is for the learning experience.  Your share of the work will be so minimal that you will most likely receive nothing but a higher power bill.
If you plan to purchase an ASIC in the future, it **might** be worth your while to figure it all out with your PC and GPU first, but even that is questionable as the settings for an ASIC would likely be different.

I was rejected when I purchased once.  I had no problems getting a hold of them.  I was informed that they have an automatic tool which determines if a buy is questionable, fraudulent, etc., and it just isn't perfect.  After asking them, they were able to complete my purchase at the agreed upon price, even though the market was rocketing up and they could have just sent me back into the queue to buy at a new higher price.  Just ask, it won't hurt anything.

But maybe Bitcoin adoption will encourage all the coke heads to go get library cards...

Do you really have such airflow issues that you need the cards out of the case?

My grandma used to always give me a savings bond for Christmas and another one for my birthday.  I never thought of them as money, I never thought of just running to the bank to cash them out, I saw them as an investment.
If I were giving out paper wallets as a gift I'd just tell people to just store 'em somewhere safe and forget about 'em.  Maybe they'll find 'em 10 years later... maybe they'll be worth something then.
