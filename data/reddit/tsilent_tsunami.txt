Yes, there are tons of complaints from people claiming they've been screwed over by Paypal *for no reason*, but if you look at the ones that have appeared on reddit, about 95% of those turn out to involved violations of the TOS. 
It would be rather shocking if a company that large didn't make errors, but jumping onto the "*yep, they're bad because I've seen a lot of comments saying so*" bandwagon would put you on pretty shaky ground.

It's really interesting how throughly unprofessional the whole thing is, and that the future of this "new world money" is being debated in snide remarks on a thing like twitter, by someone named "Gavin" and some autistic kid. People who've "invested" real time and money into "bitcoin" must be hating life about now. 
Watching the pathological behavior of the enthusiasts has been entertaining, but there comes a point when you start to feel embarrassed for people.

Real answer? No one cares about the actual (stupid/uninformed) opinions being expressed by the masses of average people on reddit. It's more like keeping track of the weather, or perhaps more accurately, monitoring the state of fisheries and the movements of schools of fish within them to facilitate more efficient harvesting.

Just remember, "they're manipulating us so hard that none of our thoughts are really our own..." 
The really interesting thing about bitcoin is how attractive it is to crazies. I've seen a number of cults over the years, and been close to some beside bitcoin. Remember the [Orange People]( So many people walking around in all shades of red/orange... Having a cult that's explicitly financial is an interesting development after all the "spiritual enlightenment" and "personal development" cults of the recent past. Fun stuff!

Personally, the reward would have to be pretty high for me to wander around in the land of "I'm not sure if it could truly be called illegal".

No, this is literally my experience from the last couple times I've read these "The police stole money from some poor innocent guy just passing through" stories on reddit. There's always a claim of innocence, because it would be just dumb to bring this kind of claim to media attention then confess that the police were right about it actually being drug money. 


Are you really citing the case in that story where the police returned their money when they followed the established procedure for the return of legitimate money? This appears to be due process at work. 
I know a bit about this issue from personal experience. Of all the money and stuff seizures I have personal knowledge of, it's been drug related 'roughly' 100% of the time. Yes, a number of them didn't have a lot of extra money, so they tried various stories to "explain" so they could get it back. I won't bore you with the potential strawmen here. 
No, I'm not arguing against due process. People with legitimate money have an established procedure for the return of their money. It's the people *unable* to use due process due to the unlawful sources of their money that end up not getting it back. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:21:07
Hahaha, you have to admit, it's a very effective tactic.
The fact that people fall for this stuff doesn't really reflect on bitcoin itself. It worse than that. Humans are ridiculously easy to manipulate. Internet forums are like the perfect place to practice these dark arts.

That's classic victim absolving, to paraphrase something I saw recently. If you're going to take the perspective that people should be able to exhibit any behavior and never experience negative results, that's just outside of reality. 
Your worldview would become much more functional if you made a place in it for normal human behavior. People rob and murder and rape and steal and commit numerous other crimes all the time. This isn't going to stop anytime soon. Telling victims to just ignore the possibility of certain behaviors leading to these results is doing them a huge disservice.

He really failed to make his point, but I think I see where he was headed.
The Nigerian princes openly admit they're from Nigeria, which would be a red flag for all but the obtuse, because it reduces the false positives in their replies. Likewise with the dysfunctional grammar, but that's irrelevant here. The replies to those ridiculous emails tend to be only those who are solidly in the target market, and those with a firm grasp of reality are weeded out. 
was trying to make the point that it's bitcoin itself that creates the "self-weeding garden". As in, there's major overlap between those attracted to bitcoin and those most susceptible to scams. Or perhaps it was those attracted to the runup to over $1000? 
Regardless, the consistent theme seen over and over (in the two or so years I've been here) is that of people being scammed, or ripped off in some way. People downloading bitcoin price apps from unknown randoms. Putting their money and coins into MtGox, even after they had to fight their way through all the red flags. How many times have we seen the "Hey, I can't withdraw my money from [choose your exchange example]? And all those other ways to "inadvertently relinquish ownership" of ones bitcoins I haven't mentioned. 
The keepers of the cult around bitcoin don't like this aspect (Bitcoin aficionados HATE it!), but bitcoin has been and is a scammers paradise.

There's no need to say 1.00000 (or 140.000), when it's clear it's the whole number with no fractions. 
Dollars can go either way. $140.00 is valid, but you could also just say $140, because the lack of digits to the right of the decimal point imply zeros.

You actually might, depending on their behavior. For example, people physically touching the dead bodies of ebola victims with their bare hands and bodies. This behavior is the exact and only reason they themselves become infected. They are 100% responsible for infecting themselves with the disease. 




In a related sense, many victims are guilty of 'essentially' creating an attractive nuisance for criminals. Yes, focus should be placed on the criminals who are committing the crimes, but I believe we've been doing that for quite some time, and the criminals are still there.
The problem with the concept of "victim blaming" is that it removes all responsibility for ones own behavior. I generally don't have a problem with victims being victimized due to their own stupidity. What I disagree with about the concept of "victim blaming" is the *tricking* of people (admittedly not the brightest...) into behaving in ways that are self-harmful, when they ordinarily wouldn't have.
The people promoting the concept of "victim blaming" are intentionally creating more victims.

It's a given that the criminal shouldn't be committing crimes. However, nothing so far has seemed to stop that. The main point here is that they're going to continue, and there's no way to have much effect on that.
Soooooo, focusing on the only behaviors you *can* affect, and at the same time on the very people who have the most at stake... we arrive at the people behaving in ways that cause them to be chosen by the criminals. If they don't care and are fine with being victims, then they have no need to change anything.

If bitcoin "succeeds", it will be *despite* people like you.
There probably *are* some "bitcoin trolls", but if so, they're a very tiny fraction of the people who get *called* trolls by the delusional people in here. Fact is, most people who get called trolls are simply trying to interject some reality into the fantasy life many in this sub appear to inhabit. 
If I were going to attack bitcoin, I'd hire (or encourage) people to act insane and also become virulent and very outspoken bitcoin supporters. So outspoken and insane that they would attack anyone attempting to help bitcoin actually succeed. Call them trolls. Make wild claims about them. Gather the weak minded to their side and shun the reality based people. This is happening now, right in this sub.

Things change. I've had businesses in a number of different areas. Many of the more profitable opportunities are somewhat like "glitches", and those tend to get patched at some point. 
But even more standard market opportunities go through cycles. Laws change, competition rears its ugly head, etc. 
Oh, to vaguely answer your question. When you find yourself extremely knowledgeable about a market that's in the beginning stages, people interested in taking advantage of that market will, if they're smart, pay someone ($$$) to get them up to speed rapidly.

Yeah, you could see the same strategy at work in the email chain. Just enough to keep stringing them along, without any actual followup. 
The thing that really annoys me about situations like this is that it takes both sides for a scam to work. You need the scammer who preys on the weak, then you need the weak who just roll over and keep taking it. Makes me want to shout "STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING PUSSY" at them. Go punch the guy in his pretty face a few times. Break some fingers if that doesn't work. He'll pay up. But I guess the whole point is that a good scammer chooses a mark who just accepts his fate. Bah.

This is one of the most interesting attributes of The maymay apparently goes: "If you're not 100% with us without question, then you're against us and *you're a troll!*
In my view, the fact that bitcoin has attracted this kind of "You're a troll!" person is the predominant sign that (despite all its positives) it's probably doomed to either fizzle or be relegated to its current minor status. There's a possibility that bitcoin can be wrested away from the social losers that currently control it, but never underestimate how self-destructive internet based "communities" can be.
So, I looked at that guys comments for the last 4-5 days, and there's really nothing that appears to be "rampant trolling" in there. Yes, he can be critical and doesn't seem to be the overly sensitive type. But I'm also seeing him raising some valid points. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:04:27


IMO, your insistence on "shoulds and shouldn'ts" (re: licensing and paperwork - as seen in a couple other comments) that limit the money people can or will give to your cause **should** end. 
It's your thing, so feel free to make people jump through whatever hoops you want. Let your anti-government beliefs limit the funds you're able to raise, but don't then complain that you're not able to help as many people as you would like.

"Stupid" laws wouldn't become law if everyone agreed with your opinion. See my above comment:


The mistake you're making here is putting your own personal opinion above everyone elses. If you so strongly desire to partake in activities that are illegal in your country/location, perhaps consider moving to a place where people accept this activity?


Lawbreakers should be broken. Laws exist because a majority of the people covered by this law do not want that particular activity to take place. The society in which you reside has both the right and power to regulate your behavior. If you persist in defying them, then you should be subject to the proscribed punishment. 
If your "morals" are inconsistent with your society, either convince *them* to change, change yourself, or leave.

Something tells me this is an inadvertent self-reference. It's the people who call anyone pointing out the bitcoin negatives a troll who are the ones that have to be overcome before bitcoin could be "vindicated". So in reality, those calling people trolls and shills are the real bitcoin trolls. 
A socially functional person would just acknowledge that bitcoin has many challenges standing in the way of success, the bitcoin "community" not being the least of them. Cults are for the fringes of society. Cult-like behavior is definitely *not* attractive to the vast majority of people.

How exactly is that a "problem"? What I'm seeing is that you're saying the real problem is that people don't agree with you. This puts you in the minority, and your beliefs on homosexuals are not as popular as you would like. 
The obvious solution is to move to a location where the majority of people have the same beliefs as you. That is, if you can't change the minds of your opponents in the first location. 
Personally, I think homosexuals should be tolerated if they're very discreet about their perversions, otherwise, suppress and/or eradicate them.

You'll always find a tiny thread everyone tries to ignore with links to the news story about the guys extensive criminal history and arrests for drug sales. When the source of seized money isn't the black market or from criminal activities, the owner gets it back.

Well, consider some examples where attempts *are* being made to change victims behaviors. We put warnings on cigarette packages, promote healthy diets, advise people to exercise, promote *safe sex*, and an extensive list of other recommended behaviors, or behavioral changes. 
The social unacceptability of promoting safe behaviors to avoid criminal victimization is extremely conspicuous when compared to all the other efforts to safeguard and improve peoples lives. When you consider the degree of self-responsibility avoidance the concept of "victim blaming" creates, it might well be one of the great horrors of our time. 
Maybe overstated, since I haven't researched it, but consider how critical self-responsibility is in virtually all aspects of our lives.

I recommend not basing an argument on this, as that makes it an argument built on a foundation of straw. People rarely get raped just for "dressing slutty". Also, this argument is the least likely of all "victim blame/absolve" arguments to have a productive result, because it's built on such a poor foundation. 
People get raped for exhibiting behaviors that invite rape, or behaviors that demonstrate they are the "best" (in the judgement of the potential rapist - however sound or unsound that may be...) victim out of the available selection. Physical impairment through alcohol is a popular route to being raped, I hear. As is unthinkingly placing yourself in an indefensible situation with a person for whom rape is a viable option. (If you're a poor judge of character, exercise more caution than you believe necessary.) 
This whole line of discussion is far more interesting from the perspective of the criminal, because they're the one *actually doing the selection process*. In the case of physical interaction crimes, there is virtually always an [INTERVIEW PHASE]( where they probe the responses of the potential victim to see if they'll respond with proper victim behaviors. If they do, then the criminal moves on to the next phase. See  for an accessible presentation of this concept. 
But victims often create the situation where they become victimized in non-physical crime situations. Note the word "often" there, because there are degrees of reasonableness in adjusting ones behaviors to minimizing victimization. Choosing to live in close proximity with people who commit crimes (become a ghetto/sketchy neighborhood dweller) greatly increases the likelihood of being selected. While it's not as blatant as leaving a nice laptop on the front seat of a vehicle parked overnight in a sketchy neighborhood, there is a definite choice in favor of higher risk there.
Cutting it here before it becomes a book... and skipping the nuance phase. In short, every behavior one can exhibit can be expected to prompt responses. Correct and insightful analysis of those potential responses is the key to intentionally avoid being selected as the "victim of the moment".

Besides being illegal, and leading to large fines and potential prison time? Aside from that minor matter, creating shares in a legitimate non-scam business and disclosing all relevant information has no particular moral repugnance.

No. And okay, it's not necessarily "sad". Maybe the right word is unfortunate. Unfortunate for bitcoin itself that so many who believe they're supporters are actually "the cancer that's killiing it". 
When enough utter losers successfully associate themselves with bitcoin, in the eye of the general public, it's not a case of all publicity is good publicity. The opinions of the "bitcoin community" are not the significant factor here.

Him in particular? I'm here because, while bitcoin used to have a lot of potential as a cool new technology, it's now all about the human train wreck and amazing pathology. Like if you had a front row seat to the implosion of *Scientology*. 
Unfortunately, the majority of people attracted to the bitcoin concept are so divorced from reality that its "failure to thrive" is virtually guaranteed. Nothing against the technology; It's the supporters and "enthusiasts" who are working to ensure it never gains widespread acceptance. 
Their failure to apprehend a linkage between behavior and result, along with the general drama between personalities, topped with an overlay of human greed, make this a highly entertaining (albeit disappointing) show.

I get that bitcoin is cool and new, but there are significant "challenges" it has yet to address. As of this date, it's far from being superior to anything with the exception of some relatively minor niches. 
But my real point is that even if this general concept of 'money' takes off, it may well be when the *bitcoin killer* makes its appearance. Yes, bitcoin has opened the door, but a newer and *significantly superior* technology could appear at any time. We would have to see the new technology before being able to determine if bitcoin is the VHS or the BetaMax in that story.

Even the technical people have trouble not losing it to hackers and scammers. I have a peripheral interest in bitcoin (past few years), but for the past year or so, the pathology of the "bitcoin community" has been far more interesting. More specifically, Between that other coin protocol (starts with "E" ?), the issue of that fundamental flaw (re: comments on it a week or so ago. Guy got downvoted, but no rebuttals to his primary concern. He was the "bitcoin is the one world government currency, to track you all" guy.), and the relative insanity of a substantial percent of the bitcoin community, it seems likely that 'slowly' might be an overestimate.

Firstly, their claims of intentions for the money are irrelevant. I'm aware of several millions of dollars of drug money being to make purchases. 
Secondly, they apparently used due process as intended to effect the return of their money. So despite the drug paraphernalia in their vehicle, it seems they had a plausible legitimate source for the cash, if the article can be believed. It claims the money was returned to them. 
Look up the procedures for your state for the return of seized monies and/or property. There is likely to be a certain degree of scrutiny involved, as "the strawman" I cited above is not as uncommon as you would hope. People can point to and pretty much prove sources for legitimate cash. When the sources are not legitimate, it's often better to just forego that scrutiny and take the loss. However, since "better" isn't a universal constant, you'll still see stories on reddit of the guy trying to get his cash back, and it turns out he has an extensive history of arrests for drug and other crimes. Dig into those stories, because that history is usually buried or ignored by the vast majority of commenters, and all too often, by the writers of the stories themselves.

I guess I'm looking more at the effects on the victim. A relatively minor behavioral change by the potential victim can successfully deter victimization completely. In the case of violent crimes (rape, robbery, murder, etc.), it seems to me like an example of it being a good value for the effort. 
For the victims who "can't be arsed" (as the Brits say), they can simply continue on and take  their chances. My whole point above is mainly directed at the potential victim pool who wish not to be victimized. For them, there are definite specific behaviors they can delete from their "available behaviors" list to *significantly* reduce their risk.

Yeah, not "buying" it. I would suggest not taking language cues from the cognitively challenged. 
You can't *ring* a person. You *can* cause (the bell on) their telephone to ring, so you could say, "I'm going to ring _supert_s phone". Since you presumably are human and therefore "don't ring", you can't say, "I'm going to ring _supert_". Even if your skull were hollowed out, it's unlikely to have the resonance to actually ring when struck.

The other guy said you're going to walk away thinking you "won the argument". I told him it doesn't matter. You don't have to understand how faulty your own thought process is for it to be faulty.

This could be the problem. The issue you're having is with getting the exact phrasing correct. 
"High odds" = no meaning (There's no argument to indicate what this means. For? Against? Increased? Decreased?)
"Odds are that [X]" = X is likely to happen
"Odds are against [X]" = X is unlikely to happen


You can essentially replace the word 'odds' in this context with the word 'chances'. When you *increase the chances* sufficiently, the odds are 100% that [X] is going to happen. 


In English, you're going to need to specify high odds of *what*? Happening? Not happening? When you just say "high odds", it could be either one. 
Does that help make it more clear? I'm not sure how your language works, so don't know which parts to stress here. If the above doesn't make sense, reply and I'll try to explain better.

Yes, it's lazy in the sense that it's a *shortcut phrase* instead of typing out a whole paragraph. If you're lacking the context that would make that instantly understandable, here's a "still brief" explanation. 
True believers are those who have a cult-like belief in something. Their filter on reality rejects conflicting information before it enters their consciousness. Some internet definitions of, and relating to, a true believer:
 * One who is deeply, sometimes fanatically devoted to a cause, organization, or person:
 * a zealous supporter of a particular cause: "*it's impossible to argue with those true believers, as they think any counter-evidence is proof of an evil conspiracy*"
 * Zealous: fervent, ardent, fervid, fanatical, passionate, impassioned, devout, devoted, committed, dedicated, hard-core, enthusiastic, eager, keen, overkeen, avid, card-carrying, vigorous, energetic, intense, fierce;
 * A person who earnestly believes in something, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary. Usually used as a derogatory term to imply the lack of critical thinking and/or intelligence on part of the true believer. Particularly when that's the case.
 * *True-believer syndrome* is an expression coined by M. Lamar Keene to describe an apparent cognitive disorder characterized by believing in the reality of paranormal or supernatural events after one has been presented overwhelming evidence that the event was fraudulently staged.
In this context, the guy (in this sub) who said "*I truly believe bitcoin is going to take over the entire world economy*" would probably be a true believer. As those who believe "*bitcoin will end States, and finally bring about world peace*". There have been far too many to tag them all, but they tend to be very young and lacking knowledge of the world, or suffering from a (natural or self-induced) cognitive malfunction that inhibits their perceptions of reality. 
You can see why I sometimes use a shortcut term.

The *legitimacy of Bitcoin* comes from the "consensus" of a bunch of fucking nimrods on the internet? What I'm hearing is that bitcoin has no legitimacy at all. Okay, so I haven't looked into the details before now, but this is worse than I ever would have imagined. 
Okay, so I've seen some autistic kid, this guy losing his hair, and some other sketchy doods, and *they're* somehow involved in this "consensus"? Is that "person" in the video who apparently embedded a chunk of metal in his eyebrow a part of this? Jesus H Christ. Talk about the curtain being pulled back... 
I investigated a ring of nationwide scammers one time. Core group of about 35, who had established networks of "feeders" in prime areas around the country. The feeders got a percentage of the take. Thing was, you could tell something was "kinda off-brand" about these people when you were with them. (I was with them as a group several times) There was a kind of 'vibe' that was detectable, if not entirely explicit. Suddenly, I'm seeing a disturbing resemblance.

Sure, the nimble can still extract money from trading, and exchange scams aren't ready to die out anytime soon. AFAIK, people are still investing in penny stocks, and really, anything you could possibly "invest" in, so it's not going to totally disappear (unlike funds in so many exchanges).

Are you *sure* you were only late for two classes? If you missed contraction day, here is a quick guide:
In speech, when you contract “could have,” “would have,” or “should have,” (and slightly mispronounce) you end up with what sounds like, “could of,” “would of,” and “should of.” However, that is not what should be written, because it is wrong. Contractions are abbreviations of words blending together.
Should have --&gt; should've  
Would have --&gt; would've

Ah, I really meant this to refer to grades 1-12. Agreed that $12,000 would be a bit expensive to just learn contractions. But my main point is that, generally speaking, being demonstrably able and capable of functional communication skills carries a high value in first world countries. 
Clearly, there are environments and situations where adequacy in ones primary language is both not valued, and not a priority. Blue collar factory work and life in a correctional institution come to mind as a couple examples. 
However, your presence here, in an environment where *your facility with written English = you*, choosing to display inadequacy furthers a goal that doesn't make sense. To be realistic, there *are* plenty of people on the internet who have been saddled with an average IQ, or, for other reasons, don't value skill in ones primary communication system, but is that really the crowd you want to impress? 
To use a metaphor, the usage of "should of" by a seemingly otherwise bright guy is akin to seeing a brilliant smile, with missing and broken teeth. (Get that fixed!)

The bitcoin community is scam central. Yes, there are *some* honest bitcoin users, but scammers and criminals make up a *huge* percentage of the user base. That's what you get when it's touted as the ideal money for criminals and anti-government types. 
Your account is new, but if you've been around the past few years, you've seen hundreds of "I engage in crime with bitcoin" and "Bitcoin is great for committing illegal acts" posts. If one actually goes into the subreddit instead of just just posts that hit the front page, then it could well be into the thousands.

You can stop right there. This is a *blog*, presented exclusively by the "*the victim*". So right there we already have a one-sided story, and the side is the one with the greatest incentive to appear "wronged".
Apparently the husband was linked in some way to a Ponzi scheme someone else was prosecuted for, and this likely led to the investigation of his other activities. As it turns out, it appears he was  running an undeclared bitcoin business.

I see the changes in the past 40 - 50 years as so fundamental that the notion of a "free people" and "individual rights" are now concepts from a bygone era. Bypassing a number of large paragraphs full of examples and points... humans are now more of a "resource management" issue. 
It's really unfortunate that things have come to this point, but the massive increase in numbers, and the massive decrease in average human quality really doesn't leave much of a choice. We're in an unsustainable situation. Ideally, we could lop off about 4 billion people from the total, and roughly that same percentage here in the US.

However, I was unaware of this possible semantic issue, although it doesn't seem to apply in this "non-minor" case: 




He says:

This is not a major interest for most people, and the "enthusiasm" from bitcoin supporters tends to be self-defeating. That "magic internet money" ad, for example, might have been amusing to the in crowd, but that's not the way to get taken seriously by normal people.

Good thing you added those two words. Notable ITT is the number of people touting bitcoin as a anti-authority, anti-government, subversive force. It can either be an underground criminal organization, or it can be a legitimate alternative to other "money systems". It's my belief that bitcoin is "failing to appeal" in large part because of the extensive criminal element backing it. 
Frankly, if bitcoin succumbs to the criminals, then it needs to be banned, and anyone using it needs to be hunted down and prosecuted. It's not really clear why so many appear to prefer this result. Are these people considered part of the "bitcoin community", or are they outsiders doing everything they can to destroy it?

@_date: 2015-04-27 23:46:41
Examples? I don't know much about miners and mining beyond what I've seen here. From a theoretical standpoint, it seems like miners with a large equipment investment would act in the interests of bitcoin. 
Unless they could grab money that would outweigh their investment and potential profits over the next "X" period of time. Can they do this without being detected/identified, and just continue on with their mining? 
@_date: 2015-04-25 03:16:24


Probably because of the way the organization is structured. Yes, *some* articles are accurate, and others are simply not. How do you know the difference? And for an "ad-free" site, I've sure seen a lot of ads...

Aren't people essentially "breaking it" all the time? If there's one thing that's been consistent with bitcoin in the years I've been following it, it's been scams and hacks. The *technology* of bitcoin may be perfectly fine, in isolation, but once you start interacting with others, or even just connect to the internet, all safeties are gone. 
What percent of all bitcoins in existence are stolen? What percent of all bitcoins in actual use have been stolen? What percent of victims have been compensated for their loss? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:05:30
I don't think it's necessarily "going to zero". And even if I did, I'm still not interested in financial transactions with any of these exchanges. There may be some who are legitimate, but the sheer numbers that have been scams and rip-offs have tainted the whole deal for me. 
And not a small part of the issue is the credulousness of the 'bitcoin community' that makes this possible. That tends to cast a little shadow on their assessment of other things, like whether bitcoin is actually going to take over the world and usher in an unprecedented era of peace and harmony. Anyway.
Just don't put in more than you can afford to lose. Hope it works out for you. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 12:38:40

lol, this is exactly what we're talking about. The "this" is you completely missing the point, because you're simply too young to understand the point. And the thing is, this applies across most or all aspects of the human experience. Relationships, business, risk assessment, and everything else that involves humans and their interactions. 
You can get older without learning very much at all. The opportunities to gain a greater depth of understanding across the whole range of human experience can fly right by. Yes, some people remain a "ditz" their whole life. Normally abled people tend to pick up on successful strategies over time. These learning opportunities are simply not available to the very young, because they arise *over time*. 
So, your "you're not better because you're older" argument is an amusing misunderstanding of the point. The good news for you is that the odds are in your favor of growing out of your condition.

Well, I actually watched that whole video. I hope you can see through his presentation. It's designed to be very appealing to an extremely naive viewpoint, but its an endless stream of unfounded assertions and disingenuous "facts". 
In a way, it reminds me of the intentional errors in those email messages from Nigeria. The blatant errors weed out anyone but the most gullible, and make the most efficient use of the scammers time. Most who would end up questioning their apparent good fortune have already dismissed the whole thing as a scam.
I think the guy is (if it's not just intentional propaganda for some unknown purpose) on drugs, or has mental issues that distort his perceptions of reality. Okay, I don't think he really believes what he's saying. It's probably part of a scheme to relieve the naive from their excess money. 
Simply put, violence is both necessary and desirable. There are tons of people who need to be physically corrected, imprisoned, or killed. I've personally encountered several thousand of them on subs like and other subs that attract a similar demographic. Then, think of people like the homosexuals out in real life... And other undesirables... If this guy were successful in eliminating "the state", then we would have to take matters into our own hands. As it stands now, we still complain about the state not killing these people, but we defer to their superior force. 
There's no way *a rational person* could want to eliminate the state, or their monopoly on violence.

With some significant disadvantages. My cash doesn't rely on the internet or the presence of electricity for its existence. Bitcoin pretty much requires the presence of an electronic device of some kind in order to use it. And it's the insecurity of these devices and the internet in general that let hackers and scammers make off with stolen bitcoins all the time. 
While cash *does* have serial numbers, those can't practically be used to track and trace my every transaction in the way bitcoin does. Cash lets my transactions remain private. It's also just plain simple to use. (Unless you're blind, but then bitcoin would kind of be out of the question.)

Well, clearly not. And if it *was* intended to be a valid argument, that would just be silly. I don't know what argument you're talking about in particular, if any, but in my experience, that phrase is typically not meant to be an actual rebuttal. It's more of a "Wow, you're so far from reality that there's really no way to get there from here". The only solution is generally to wait for the completion of brain development, and for it to then experience some real life, as a sort of "burn-in" phase.

See that, but it's kinda like "undermining yourself, or your argument". Where "you" are the argument, and your foot is your support, since it's literally holding you up... 
You were arguing against comparing bitcoin to its value in 'real money' above, but you ended by saying if everything goes well, the value of bitcoin in real money will increase. You had just been arguing against it having an outside value.

How did you know about your tag?

There have been articles about this for years. I'm sure you could probably find articles saying how great it is to get cheap drugs from India, but do the research yourself, since you apparently missed all those stories when they came up. 
If you're going to base your personal knowledge level on what I do or don't "prove", you're going to shortchange yourself. I really have no interest in finding the articles to prove this to you.

It may or may not *raise* a question, but it definitely doesn't "beg the question". When you don't know what words or phrases mean, it's best to look them up before attempting to use them.

I've actually had some success in exchanging those worthless tokens for valuable items. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:22:32


Was a shortcut because we're talking about someone with an account at an exchange. Yes, you can get into small amounts with localbitcoins and other anon sources. These are always going to be a very small part of the market.

This is what he's talking about. Bitcoin trolling in real life.
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:45:07


Many of a banks "products" involve them interacting with other entities. If you keep requesting them to interact with entities that don't meet their standards (due to money laundering, scams, or other issues), perhaps you and that bank don't have compatible business interests. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 06:31:57


He's not just talking the talk, OP is actually out there in the world, actively trolling restaurant servers with bitcoin tips. One of the best and most effective bitcoin trolls ever? You decide.
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:44:17


Aside from spelling issues, the public recording of every bitcoin transaction is not exactly a guarantee of anonymity. If anything, it sounds like the wet dream of a surveillance state. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:39:45


No. This is far from the truth.

What would be their motivation to use it? Unless you're talking about people who already have bitcoin.

You wish. Instead of trying to lie about the situation, what if bitcoin were made so viable in real life that the freaks would turn away in disgust? Then actual people in real life might not automatically be repelled.

Yes, some unknown entity is *paying people* to come to reddit and attack you for trolling servers at restaurants. Do you think it might be someone from the restaurant industry that's financing these paid shills?

Added the quotes to better reflect the situation, and no, it's not at all absurd. Given the complexity of bank regulations, it's not uncommon to find those translated into fairly conservative practices at some banks. 
I use a credit union myself, but that doesn't make me unaware of standard practices among various banking institutions.

Free consultations are for attorneys who don't have enough clients. (why do you suppose that is?)


The "or more" part is accurate. How long do you think it would take to go from zero, to gaining enough understanding of Vermont currency laws to write a "lawyerly letter" on it?

Yes. The ones who call everyone wanting to talk about problems needing to be solved a troll.

You're right. Most of the paid commenting positions *are* relatively poorly paid. They mainly pay by the hour, by the word, or by the number of comments posted. However, there are some hedge funds (one in particular - you probably know this one) that pays *very well*, and has fantastic bonuses for every successful conversion!
