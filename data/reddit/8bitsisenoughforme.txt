A bank run on USDT would be like you described.
I actually see it go above 1 often, like 1 USDT is worth $1.07.  I think they are behaving like the fed with “over the market” operations to target overnight interest rates.  When it deviates too much from $1, they buy or sell USDT (that they generate out of thin air or take out circulation/destroy) with BTC until it gets more in line.  This will work until they run out of btc to sell to prop up the USDT value (like the Bank of England running out foreign reserves to defend the pound fixed rate in the early 90s). So if there are too many USDT sellers all at once, look out!

Thank you for the explanation.  I am still trying to wrap my head around LN.  I am curious.  What happens if the users engages in some off-chain transactions and then reneges and refuses to sign the LN address 
waiting for the timeout to get his coins back?

Leverage is a multiplier. Bitcoin goes up 10%, your portfolio goes up 20% (same with drops).  Now imagine you have a 5 or 10x multiplier with a couple lucky timing decisions.  That 50% run just became 250%.

Ah ok - that makes sense.  They are just like delayed real transactions that are batched together at the end.  Thanks!

Yeah one day I woke up and realized this too. Now I screen shot all 2fa barcodes, save it in a zip, encrypt it with aes-256-CBC and upload it to last pass as a secure note.  Recoverable but secure.

Just curious, what prevents a malicious actor from doing the same?

The limit price is the price you buy at not the amount you want to buy.  You need to but 12000 or whatever the current price is.

Cool, thank you for the explanation.  Seems less secure to me.  I will probably stick with google 2fa then.

The 1d on the btc/usd chart looks ugly. Inverse H&amp;S pattern and right on the neckline looking to break that support.  I am bullish for btc and crypto in 2018 but my entry level might be below 10K (10k is another support so that will be tested too a few times once 13K breaks).  We need to see blood from the newbies before we can move forward.

What are you talking about?  Historically, January is the best month of the year for the traditional stock market.  It even has its own name - [the January Effect](

You can always tell when a big sell is about to occur because GDAX will freeze and stop responding. Eventually it will reload and there will be a big giant red candle on your screen.  Seen it happen 4 times now.

And the UI looks like something from the 80s like the old Wall Street movie
