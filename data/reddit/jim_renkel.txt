the stuff done off the main chain will be done by the wallet or other app that supports LN, and, as i understand it, is minimal.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:33:15
yes, and yes, as i understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:23

i don't think you can transfer usd out of an unverified exchange account.

@_date: 2017-12-16 17:56:23
the spam doesn't make it any easier to mine: ya still gotta roll the dice until you roll a magic number. with different sets of transactions the sets of magic numbers are different, but there's no more or less of them, so on the average it still takes the same number of rolls.
allowing fewer high fee transactions through will drive up the fees, but you're risking short term against long term income. tricky game to play, no guarantee of success.
and you'd just be pushing some of your income to other miners.
but i wouldn't put it past some miners to try it, and if they collaborated in the scheme their odds of success get better.

an exchange is where you can buy and sell coinage.
a wallet is where you keep coinage between buying and selling it. 
you can keep it on an exchange, but there are risks.
but there can be fees for transferring to / from an exchange.
so it all depends on what you're trying to do: hodl, keep you coinage in a wallet; trade, keep your coinage at an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:45:03

@_date: 2017-12-28 08:16:15
in general, any wallet will work with any exchange. there may be exceptions, but I don't know of any off hand.
what makes this possible are addresses. when ya want to transfer coins, e.g., from an exchange to a wallet, ya get a receiving address from your wallet and tell the exchange to send the coins to that address. the exchange uses that address in the blockchain transaction it creates, and the wallet, monitoring the blockchain, sees and recognizes it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:38:05

you can't push to GitHub until you have it working in your local repo. pushes tend to come in floods.
LN is, and will be forever, separate from core, if for no other reason than it is intended to also work with other blockchains.

opening and closing a lightning channel requires a blockchain transaction each, so there's no inheirant improvement there. once opened, on channel transactions are almost instataneous and free.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:11:28
miners don't encrypt keys, useless or not.
they propose a validation of a set of transactions, and prove that it wasn't easy to do.
their proposed validation must in turn be easy to validate by all the nodes of the network.
that is how consensus is reached: a miner does the hard work and everybody agrees is was done correctly.
in order for this to contribute to the security of the network, it has to be on the state of the network at the time the work was performed, and competing miners must work on the same problem.
how does rendering a 3d movie validate transactions, even if it is provably hard to do? :-)

transferring funds from your bank to the exchange can take days.
transferring purchased coins from the exchange to your wallet should only take hours, even under heavy load: gdax pays a generous fee for the transfer.

segwit is hard to implement in wallets. folk are working on it. it's coming. LN requires segwit, so that's providing some impetus.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:40:08

there's a big difference between an open source project and an in-house project, and how they are managed. from my perspective, the Bitcoin core and LN open source projects are pretty well managed.

@_date: 2017-12-30 03:09:28
your first "premined" block would have to refer to the existing head of the valid chain, and each other premined block would have to refer to the previous one. so you can only find valid nonces as the blocks are added to the chain. to do this, you would need way more hash power than the rest of the world put together.
in short, ya can't really premine blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:42:54

@_date: 2017-12-26 08:13:41
unlike the blockchain, where you can send coins to an address without the address owner's consent or cooperation, as i understand it, transferring coins to an LN pubkey requires the participation of the owner of that pubkey.
I think this would make the use of LN impractical for a tipbot, but i could be wrong.

my understanding is yes, but only the fees paid in acquiring or disposing the coins go into the cost basis.

I think bitcoin's strategy is spot on in the long run, but dependent on, e.g., the LN getting their part right. I've got a few reservations there, but nothing that can't be fixed rather easily. it is still early days there.
I think cash's strategy is only good for the short term, and will ultimately be unworkable by itself. fortunately for them, LN is designed to work with other blockchains, and if it is successful with bitcoin, it can be successful with cash.

block size increases only give linear growth in transaction capacity, with linear growth in accompanying costs to process the chain.

each LN channel is "centralized" between its two endpoints. but the LN as a whole uses the blockchain, and its use contributes to the dectralization of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:01:18
again, what are you accomplishing by repeating an oft made comment?
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:40:28
the fee does *not* depend on the amount of the transaction. ya can move 1,000 BTC for the same fee as 1 mBTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:32:58
In LN, there is a "channel" between each pair of users that are exchanging funds. So , obviously, a user has a separate channel with each other user with which they are exchanging funds. Eventually, as LN usage grows, there will be millions of simultaneous channels open in the LN network.
But each channel only carries messages about funds exchanges between the channel's endpoints, so on-channel scaling isn't an issue.
Yes, each user has a "node" that is both on-chain to the entire blockchain network and on-channel with other users (but only other users with which it is exchanging funds).
While there may be many on-channel messages to exchange funds between two users, there will be very few blockchain transactions as a result.
So scaling on the blockchain and on LN channels is, hopefully, not an issue.

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:39:13
i don't think that's true. the developers' mailing list is full of ideas for improvements. there's no roadmap that i know of, but it may be too early for that.

@_date: 2017-12-05 09:15:45
don't be alarmed by that time estimate: it can be way off.

there is a minimum 0.01 BTC for limit orders. market orders and transfers have no limit.
you can get around the limit order minimum by, e.g., buying 0.012 BTC, then turning right around and selling 0.01 BTC. but that can be risky, it's almost like day trading, and requires having 0.01 BTC equivalent of extra fiat to play the game with.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:23:43
it's not a thing.
the miner of a block decides what transactions to include in it.
they presumably take higher fee transactions first, but they are not required to.
also, they may not have yet seen your transaction when they start mining the next block.

this is only a problem when goods and services are valued in fiat. if they are valued in coins, then the fiat value of a coin at any given time is immaterial, and can fluctuate all it wants.

@_date: 2017-12-21 10:07:08
I could be wrong, but I don't know of any anticipated improvements that would require a hard fork. they're all built on segwit, and segwit was designed specifically so that hard forks for things like this wouldn't be required.
you are correct about batching improvements that require hard forks, but given the above we may wind up hard forking just for a blocksize increase! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:19:41
you can simulate, e.g, a market buy of 0.002 with a limit buy of 0.012 followed immediately with a limit sell of 0.010, and you even save on exchange fees!
with a little spread between the buy and sell, you can even make a tiny profit. be sure to pay those capital gains taxes!

there are only miner fees to transfer to / from the exchange, and some exchanges, e.g., gdax, pay them for you.

buys and sells are internal to gdax, don't involve blockchain, so no blockchain fee. they charge a fee for market orders, but not limit orders, but that's a gdax fee.
transfers involve the blockchain, but gdax pays the fees for you. generally the fee they pay is high enough that the transaction gets in the next block. nice of them, isn't it?

coins are stored on the blockchain at an address that is derived from your public key, which is uniquely derived from your private key.
if you give the same private key to two wallets, they generate the same public key from it, and then can use any addresses that are generated from that.
you have to give one wallet's generated address to the other, but they will both then see all at coinage at that address on the blockchain.
depending on the wallets, it may be a little tricky, but i have never had a problem doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:02:04

the exchange has nothing to do with it.
all coins from the original chain will, in effect, be duplicated onto the new chain at the time of the fork. some exchanges will credit you with an amount of new coins equal to the amount of original coins that they have for you, but you can't and shouldn't count on this.
to make sure you get them, before the fork you should move your coins to an address you control.
after the fork, there is the possibility that, if you spend either your old coins or your new coins, the coins from the other chain will also be spent in the same way.
there are several ways to avoid this.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:05:46

i would think it very unwise to, at the time of the fork, have your coinage anywhere but on addresses that you alone control.
after the fork, it will be fairly easy to "split" them to new addresses that again you alone control, but different addresses for each chain. once this is done, you can safely move and sell them, or do whatever you want with them.

the "extra" output is a change output. the input must be entirely spent, but it may be more than you intend to spend, so you have to send the change back to youself.

@_date: 2017-11-01 23:54:16
yes, to the first question.
as to the second question, it's not that you're double spending one set of coins, it's that you have two sets of coins, one on each chain, to spend.
there is a danger here, and that is when you first spend the coins on one chain that transaction can be replayed on the other chain, spending thse coins in exactly the same way. if they are not sent to yourself, whoever they were sent to gets twice what you intended.
so, one trick is to send the coins to yourself on one chain. if that transaction gets replayed on the other chain, no harm. in fact it saves you work, 'cause if the transaction doesn't get replayed, you would send the coins on the other chain to youself.
now the coins are "split", and can be safely spent on each chain separately.
note that this requires two wallets, one for each chain, or a wallet that supports both chains. but you're going to need that anyhow to spend the coins from the two chains.

if you're talking about verifying signatures in and of transaction that have been comitted to the blockchain, then i don't see why nodes need to (re)verify them at all, they were verified when they were committed to the blockchain.
if you're talking about verifying signatures in and of tranactions that are in the mempool and waiting commitment to the blockchain, then, yes, they need to be verified no matter how far back the UTXOs are that they refer to.
i don't see how anything else would be acceptable, especially a cutoff of 100 blocks: that's less than a day.
or is the reverification in blocks needed to establish the longest chain? but that depends on double spend checks, not signature verfication, at least as i understand it.

you generally over commit to the side chain, so in the end you need to go back to recover what you didn't spend on the side chain.
the alternative is to under commit, but then you need to commit again if you want to spend more. this incurs extra fees on the main chain, so you avoid this.

... which will reduce tranaction sizes and therefore fees when ya send those somewhere in the future.
if you now send a low fee (maybe even 0?) / long delay transaction to consolidate the coins to one address now, you may come out ahead when you need a high fee / short delay transaction in the future.
OTOH, you decrease your security if the multiple addresses were generated from different private keys: now they're on a single address generated of necessity from a single private key, therefore easier to steal.

your coins are "in a wallet" only because you've given the wallet a private key and / or the addresses derived from it.
the coins are really "at that address", and a single wallet supports multiple addresses.
so what's being suggested here by the wallet is to create a segwit address for your private key and move your coins from the non-segwit address(es) to the segwit address.
there is no danger in doing this, and the coins will still appear in your wallet, just at a different address. that address will be a segwit address and in the future you will benefit from that.

it never actually receives bitcoins, bit coins are always kept on the block chain. you coins are on the chain sent to addresses you control, i.e., for which you have the private key.
when you give that private key to a wallet of any kind, the wallet scans the blockchain and determines how many coins have been sent to addresses corresponding to the private key.
if the wallet is offline when new coins are sent to one of your addresses, it will automagically find them the next time it is online.

bitcoins always "live" on the bitcoin chain.
with sidechains, coins on the main chain are "committed" to a side chain, where micro transactions occur that are not recorded on the main chain. eventually, a batch of side chain transactions are consolidated back to the main chain.
the important thing is that there are or can be many, many sidechains, even within a single type of side chain. and there can be multiple types of side chains.
this is over simplified, but shows how scaling is achieved through side chains.

just beginning to understand segwit, so i could be wrong about this. don't hesitate to correct me if i am wrong.
as i understand it, there is no such thing as a segwit address, only segwit transactions.
a segwit transaction requires a multi-sig address in its output(s) in order to move the output script(s) from the transaction proper in the block to the witness data area that is adjoined to the block.
so to see how much total coinage is in segwit transactions, ya'd have to look at all the tranactions since segwit was turned on and see if the scipts of their multi-sig addressed outputs were moved to the witness data area.
it's still not clear to me whether, and if so under what conditions, input scripts can be moved to the witness data area.

yes, the signatures must be separately requested when a full node first accepts new blocks into the block chain.
but, once accepted into the block chain, they, in theory, never need to be requested again. as i understand it, that was one of advantages to segwit.
as far as i can tell, the bitcoin core full node does this, and i believe all, or most, others do too. they wouldn't be fully compliant, and therefore couldn't be trusted, if they didn't.

in short, no, or any other exchange for that matter. just my opinion.
i use gdax (the exchange behind coinbase) to buy coinage, but transfer it asap.
i haven't sold any yet. true hodler!
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:34:16
agreed. the safest node is a full node that you run for yourself on your own hardware.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:01:14
for a sweep, i'd use a zero fee. it may take days to go through, but i'm patient.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:32:55
not sure how you make that an objective definition that can be implemented in code
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:54:41
sorry, your "only reason not to" logic escapes me.
i fully expect larger blocks in the future, but only after the implementation has been more carefully implemented, tested, and deployed.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:36:43
i have done so with no problems thus far.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:59:45
why was the post removed?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:40:36
no. fiat currencies will continue to inflate, therefore bitcoin prices will inflate, just like the price of a loaf of bread, a kwh of electricity, or a unit of any other commodity.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:14:14
after switching from webcam to mobile app for verification, i've had no problems with coinbase and gdax
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:43:11
for your own protection, move your coins off of coinbase to an address you control.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:27:11
have you tried their mobile app(s)? i sometimes see inconsistencies among their web app and mobile apps.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:27:02
you made your point and i agree with you. no need for name calling.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:45:57
ya gotta crawl before ya walk before ya run. this is a known problem with many possible solutions, one of which will emerge once the basic stuff is working. for now, it is sufficient.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:45:42
this. thank you for being polite.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:56:10
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:19:45
use any wallet, but hardware preferred, to move them off of coinbase, or any other exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:20:21
better yet, sell your b2x and drive the valuation down
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:26:02
after the next halvening, the block reward will only be 6.25, then 3.125, then ....
as planned, at some point the fees will be the only income to miners.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:45:46
store of value is only one use case among many
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:08:49
yes, gemini is another exchange, like coinbase.
coinbase fees are higher, but gdax (which you can access with your coinbase account) fees are same or lower.
i run the bitcoin core full node on my pc, which includes a wallet. i have no experience yet with other wallets, so i can't recommend it except to say i think it's a good idea to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:08:08
if you're asking, "is there an algorithm that calculates a block's nonce value that results in a block's hash value below a given target value?", the answer is believed to be, "no, because the hash function is not invertible".
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:56:46
'cept that us spending more encourages more merchants to accept, which encourages more folk to get into coins, which increases demand for coins, which raises valuations, which benefits us hodlers.
it's a delicate balance.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:18:03
if you're trying to verify identity with a webcam, switch to the mobile app. that's what i had to do, and have had no problems since.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:03:00
when your coins are on an exchange, they're not really your coins, they are the exchanges coins with an entry in their books that says they should belong to you.
thus, when the new coins are generated at the fork, the new coins also really belong to the exchange. they may or may not give you the new coins, and even if they do, they may not be immediately available to you.
if your coins are not on an exchange, they really belong to you, the new coins from the fork will really belong to you, and they will be immediately available to you.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:22:28
i agree this sub needs to lighten up on its censorship
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:46:28
I've had no problem sending coinage from coinbase / gdax to a segwit address. folk prolly are just not using segwit addresses or don't know how to generate them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:21:30
... but what he said still rings true.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:31:36
no need to be rude
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:31:12
when you transfer cryptocoins to / from an exchange, that is recorded in the blockchain. when you send fiat currency to / from an exchange, that is NOT recorded on the blockchain.
trades within the exchange are also not recorded on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:25:41
i for one am not willing to risk anybody's coins, especially mine, on the chance that one chain of a fork will not be viable. for anyone, especially an orginzation, to use that as an argument against mandatory replay protection is irresponsible, imo.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:22:19
the assumption of 100% adoption is weak, imo.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:35:45
as i understand it, the actual transaction signatures are only needed when validaring a transaction to include it in a block. once a block including the transaction is added to the blockchain, the signatures are redundant, having been already validated.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:10:39
a transaction with ten inputs will pay a higher fee than one with one input.
so it sometimes makes sense to send a ten input transaction to yourself with a low fee rate, maybe even zero, and long delay. then you can spend from that single output with a higher fee rate, hence higher fee and lower delay, but still lower total fees.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:21:43
even with sidechains, and especially if they really take off, i think we'll need a blocksize increase at some point.
sidechain usage will give the opportunity to plan and test the increase properly, unlike the recent (proposed) increases.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:25:17
what. a. kludge.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:56:04
... and what would be wrong with a massive drop? hodlers could buy cheaper.
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:35:13
i completely agree with this, too.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:44:39
wait. i had a similar problem, but after about a week it completely sync'ed. since then, no problems.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:20:06
a node's relay fee is the minimum fee that a transaction must eventually pay to a miner in order to be relayed by the node to its peers. transactions paying below the relay fee won't be relayed.
i believe this was put in the cut down on spam transactions. i don't know off hand what the default value of the node relay fee parameter is.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:06:13
but, but, but, ... it's sw2x that's making a change to the consensus rules, whether or not it was satoshi's intent that such changes could be made. to my mind, it's their responsibility to implement mandatory replay protection on their fork.
also, it would be a good idea if the core developers would also implement replay protection, and in such a way that all future forks are automagically protected.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:42:02
that is correct.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:37:37
... but, under your propsal, coin holders don't get just one vote, they get one vote for each coin they hold. so the rich get to make the rules? don't think i can agree with that.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:55:35
use gdax? your coinbase account is automagically your gdax account, and fees are lower
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:21:41
only 14 network connections? yup, you're just getting started! :-)
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:29:17
... and the problem is?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:59:10
you can use gdax to transfer your coinbase coins for free!
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:44:20
many would consider it a sound investment strategy.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:27:42
as i understand it, your cost basis is what you paid for the coins at the time you purchased them, plus any fees you paid to purchse them. should be relatively easy to keep track of.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:47:06
as long as you control all three addresses, this should work, as i understand it.
if there is aproblem with this, would someone please point it out sooner rather than later, as this is the technique i plan to use to deal with the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:44:54
technically, yes. economically, maybe. practically, a fair amount of work and equipment to setup. how much do you value your time?
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:27:07
link for i2p, please?
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:57:59
yes, as long as you control the private keys you should be safe. i have no experience with ios wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:36:49
uh, don't ya also have to change the coinbase transaction and rehash the left edge of the merkle tree, at least a few times, in order to get a hash value that is less than the difficulty target?
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:56:24
my last transfer showed up in my wallet before the web page refreshed

after the lemon juice has dried, take a digital photo of the piece of paper. when you need to recover your pass phrase, print the digital photo out and hold it over heat.
or you could just photoshop a heat source into the digital photo!

1) nothing. 2) yes.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:48:05
is the fact that the subreddit is now empty an indication of non-support for sw2x? :-) btw, does have some posts.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:17:41
this is an appropriately civil post
