Wow. Laughing at Reddit’s failure and lauding an exploit in another coin that is actually the fault of a platform on which one of its use cases was housed. BTCs success has nothing to do with BCHs failure.

We hit that price and I’m screwed. I hate margin (once every 2.5 months)

What’s with the trezor ad brigade lately? I’m not against the device...but this is blatant (to me). Just kind of puts me off getting one

As a holder of both...who gives a crap about free money???? Down 10% and coming back...up like 2500% since inception and free air drop. Never sell anything in crypto...no matter how cheap it is to move. Even dogecoin I’m up like 600% in the last 3 months. Buy and hodl applies to all crytpo. No need to be bias or tied to one

But it’s a great hedge to be able to go long and short in different currency pairs on margin provided by my asset appreciation.
Thanks Kraken.  Although the trick to getting orders to actually go in consistently was tough to master...unusable most of the time but when it works it is magic with the advanced order settings they retained when they cut back.

How’d they pay for the ink?

Krakin's margin is both a great opportunity and the worst thing to ever happen to me haha. Such fun though

And here I am having bought into more at .125btc and sold for .27btc on Kraken...This morning my account value was 102% of where it was before BCH because I traded into BCH early and started swing trading conservatively. 
All together I made a bit, but the inaccessibility of the site hurt me...Amazing to see the volatility that is present and makes me wish I had more money not tied to my long positions to gamble...
Seriously unprecedented to me (although not in the sphere as a whole) to receive an altcoin token worth up to 25% of my investment just for having a position and with 0 effort on my end...to generate upwards of 11 billion $ for the holders of BTC...

Good thing his btc key wasn’t displayed. He got taught a cheap lesson

Looking back on orders from a while ago...
Fuck I paid so much usd...spending my bitcoins on such things years ago hurts now haha

Can you make a 32oz version? 
I’d buy one :)

I see chart supporting a retrace to about 2600. I am playing with a 2 to 1 short ethereum position on kraken...2 short euro 1 long usd...and have been watching all charts with fascination 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:15:29
Or if you hedged your position with some shorts when the drop started, you could have made some extra holdings...(I've been burned shorting on margin before, and I bought back in at the bottom for a small position down 29%...but I made 25% on shorts this week all while adding to both my long margin position and my separate stack...volatility is the name of the game)
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:23:36
Thank god the doubled orders work in my favor as often as against me hahaha
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:18:00
Lol drugs. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:21:36
Kraken. Site acts up sometimes. Always use limits and set your exits when you enter. It's solid af for what they let me do...5X margin on ETH and BTC...I've made and lost so much because of it haha

This comment is as brutal as the dip. 
Thanks ;)

That’s how I feel about my mining income now that I lost my job and have to use it for expenses vs hodling. 
It sucks having to part with it as it comes in and at the present price point instead of treating it like the investment it was supposed to be. Neat it makes some extra income, but I wish I didn’t have to rely on it at this point, fingers crossed for my new job!

2605.00 is my bottom call

Ah yes, the trusty nitrous tank!

Just like every 90s me has an episode of selling weed...illegal...kind of?
