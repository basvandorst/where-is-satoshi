There is no cutoff price. This is how placing orders works:
Let's say you want to buy 10 bitcoins for at most $19 each (your 'bid' price). If there are open sell orders with 'ask' price less then that, your buy order is immediately matched with them, starting with most favorable ones. If there are no sell orders with price that satisfies you, your (possiblly partially fulfilled by now) order is added to the list of open buy orders. Then it may be fulfilled when a seller willing to sell at a price lower than this appears, or you can cancel the order.
If you go to  and click 'Depth of Market', you can see the list of standing orders. 'Bid' means someone is willing to pay at most $x for a bitcoin, 'ask' means someone is willing to sell for at least $x each.
 shows the same data in a different way.
Keep in mind that Mt. Gox charges 0.65% transaction fee, so if you placed a buy order for 10 bitcoins, in reality you will get 9.935 (and similarly with USD)

Final advice - don't invest more than you are prepared to lose :)
I've lost some $2k greedily buying at $30, and then selling lower - if I wasn't prepared for the possible loss, I would be probably seriously butthurt now

The depth data probably only shows orders in certain price range. I have orders way below $17 and they don't show

In general, every offer is valid, people may have different valuations.
One of the numbers is max/min 'price', the other is 'amount' you want to buy or sell. If I understand this right, someone wants to buy 21.9 btc for $0.1 each (as in "will buy 21.93 at price 0.1"), which is low, but conceivable.
It could also mean someone wants to buy 0.1 btc for $21.93 each, but this doesn't make sense at the current market price (~$20).
