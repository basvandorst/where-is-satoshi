Obviously not. I didn't pay too much attention while doing it.

Thanks for your insight. 
I have https everywhere installed in my Tor browser and I'm pretty sure I just typed the name of the site when I went to look up the address. So it should have used SSL. I'm not convinced typing  would have prevented this. 
Don't have the circuit anymore, so it's not possible to repeat though.
Changed the link as you suggested.

WOW. I need to look into that. I kind of assumed that it would try to connect through SSL first and only fall back to http when SSL doesn't work. 
If what you say is true, then https everywhere doesn't provide nearly as much security as I thought.

On linux. I checked, but logging to disk is not enabled, so out of luck there.

I typed the name of the clearnet site in the Tor browser. The exit node then served me a fake page with a fake onion address.

Oh, I feel such a newbie. Didn't know about this. Thanks!

Thank you. Yes. But those guys are not totally stupid, so they use a newly generated address for every deposit. Also the amount ($18) isn't really worth the effort for me to try and go after.
I just wanted to draw attention to this, so it hopefully helps others to be more careful than I was.

Unfortunately not. I closed the browser before I found out I was scammed.
I've tried to hit it again by changing the circuit a bunch of times, but I could probably do that all week and still not get lucky, so I gave up.

It does. And it certainly contributed to me feeling confident that it was genuine.
