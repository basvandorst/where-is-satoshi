Very fragile ecosystem if its value is derived from hype! Not sure that’s a good representation of bitcoin.

But...that’s what tulip mania and bubbles are all about

The value of money is pretty subjective, and not clearly defined. Other factors are widely considered above the two you’ve chosen. 
You can absolutely claim that increased adoption adds to its value. However you cannot claim that the existing hype justifies the value it currently has. Sure it has actual utilitary value, but what is that value? We might be wildly, wildly out. If bitcoin stabilizes at $2 it may yet succeed as a currency but ‘die’ according to the papers and this subreddit. 
A tulip may end up being worth more in today’s stabilised price than bitcoin’s tomorrow

If you think a two-year bear market is coming then why don't you sell now, put your money to work elsewhere, and buy back in two years?

If this were remotely true you would have sued for wrongful dismissal.

Not all fiat is inflationary. E.g. the Japanese Yen is deflationary. 
Everyone agrees this is a very bad thing for the Japanese Yen.

“So long as the price of bitcoin is much higher than what I bought it at, I don’t care how the technology is used or it’s value as a currency because I would have made a profit that one time!”

I can’t wait to read these conversations in December

Market manipulation = fraud
And any currency that fluctuates in value to that extent is functionally useless 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:07:43
Market manipulation in the manner you are describing is illegal. 
Advocates of bitcoin should not want the price to fluctuate massively as it reduces its usefulness as a currency, which is its intended use.

And I’m not saying it is. 
What I’m saying is you’re perfectly willing for bitcoin to be functionally useless and a vehicle for fraud in order for you to gain a profit in the short term

And there it is
