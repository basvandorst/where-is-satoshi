A suit will not stop the damage, only make it worse, for only the reward of money. This man wants peace not even more hassles.

Can we just refer to him by the name "immature manboy" from now on?

On board diagnostics, it's the computer standard for all gasoline cars in North America since the 90s

Wait, what gives bitcoinbuilder any power or authority to sell Mt.Gox? How were those shares not worthless to begin with?

How does it work? If you need a camera phone to read the QR code can't you just display the QR code on said phone?

You can buy the same thing on amazon for 12 bucks. It's just a Bluetooth obd2. Torque and Valet apps can connect to it and do everything automatic does.

Why the hell would anyone buy gold in the first place? The only way it would make you rich is if the global economies crashed and burned.

I saw something funny online. These people posted naked pictures of themselves with QR codes to "tip" bitcoins to them. But you could tell someone had photoshopped their QR code to be THEIR QR code so the donantions actually went to the photoshopper. That's the end of my story.

So your $1200 bitcoin isn't worth $300 a month later

I wish I listened to people earlier. I now owe $15,122 that I can't pay back.

I have approximately $280,000 too, coincidentally.
Do you think I should put it into risky trades for the next two years, which are volatile enough to double or triple it, to get $750,000 for myself, too?
Or are our situations somehow different because you previously had $750,000 and I didn't? Does that increase your odds of success?
These are rhetorical questions.

It doesn't make any sense. Why are people trading bitcoins for something that takes 1/100th of the computer energy to make?
