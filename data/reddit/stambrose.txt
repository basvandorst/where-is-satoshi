Many here forget that the last November's run-up coincided with a US government shutdown.  Also, one should note the spike in bitcoin's price which occurred when Russia invaded Ukraine earlier in the year.  People hedge in times of uncertainty.
The stock market has been on yet another tear this year and the formerly mortgage-backed-securities-sobered public have been cashing out their "dogs" (bonds, gold, possibly bitcoin) for "winners"---in other words---selling low and buying high.  The public will again take a look at alternatives to growth stocks when their familiar order again appears threatened.
See this month's referendum on Scottish independence for example.  The Empire of Great Britain, undisputed and eternal master of the Earth a mere lifespan ago---my grandmother is 102---is today one of several splintering states.  Who is to say the same can't happen to the United States?  If it does, what nation will be your "bank"?  I don't know if bitcoin is the solution, and I'm definitely not "all in", but I'm more comfortable with some of my savings "in the internet" than in Chinese Yen or Portuguese/Greek Euros should the floor fall out from under the United State's dollar system.

Nice diction.  Recalls Twain.  Here's Twain replying to a reporter who called to interview him:
*Question.* Isn't that a brother of yours?
*Answer.* Oh! yes, yes, yes!  Now you remind me of it, that *was* a brother of mine.  That's William---*Bill* we called him.  Poor old Bill!
*Q.* Why? Is he dead, then?
*A.* Ah! well, I suppose so.  We never could tell.  There was a great mystery about it.
*Q.* That's sad, very sad.  He disappeared, then?
*A.* Well, yes, in a sort of general way.  We buried him.
*Q.* *Buried* him! *Buried* him, without knowing whether he was dead or not?
*A.* Oh no!  Not that.  He was dead enough.
*Q.* Well, I confess that I can't understand this.  If you buried him, and you knew he was dead---
*A.* No! no! We only thought he was.
*Q.* Oh, I see!  He came to life again?
*A.* I bet he didn't.
*Q.* Well, I never heard anything like this.  *Somebody* was dead.  *Somebody* was buried.  Now, where was the mystery?
*A.* Ah! that's just it!  That's it exactly.  You see, we were twins,---defunct and I,---and we got mixed in the bath-tub when we were only two weeks old, and one of us was drowned.  But we didn't know which.  Some think it was Bill.  Some think it was me.
*Q.* Well, that *is* remarkable.  What do *you* think?
*A.* Goodness knows!  I would give whole worlds to know.  This solemn, this awful tragedy has cast a gloom over my whole life.  But I will tell you a secret now, which I have never revealed to any creature before.  One of us had a peculiar mark,---a large mole on the back of his left hand: that was *me*. *That* *child* *was* *the* *one* *that* *was* *drowned*! ...etc., etc.

"Although no one knows for certain, it has been estimated that about 85-90% of all of the gold mined in the history of man is still in existence and that just over 100,000 tons (3.2 billion troy ounces) of gold are above ground and available to be traded in the marketplace.  If this is so, all the gold in the world would fit into one large, three-story house'' (Little and Rhodes, "Understanding Wall Street, Third Edition", 167).
Gold is scarce, not just on our planet, but---based on our understanding of physics---also throughout the universe .  Stellar furnaces alone are incapable of creating gold, rather, only in supernova or in the collision of dead star cores are the element created: 
That being said, there is a case for both physics-based scarcity and protocol-based scarcity in one's portfolio.
