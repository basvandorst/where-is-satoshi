Stop it.  You don't know anything more than any of us, and you sure as hell don't know as much as the SEC.  Positive thinking is all well and good, but this is the real world and the reality is it's a 50/50 chance.

Give it a day or two before you go calling a floor.

I'd seen the posts but didn't fully understand the implications.  I get it now... Thank you for the summary!

Patents are a double-edged sword, certainly, but they are necessary.  Patents protect people's (and companies') investments.  If you spent 5 years and a million dollars to develop a robot that cleans dishes in half the time of anyone else, wouldn't it suck for someone else to grab the first one off the shelf, spend a week reverse engineering it, then release a competing robot for $10 less?  
Patents are not the enemy here.  Notice that there is no major uproar against the fact that this patent exists.  The reason for all of the ire is that Bitmain was likely using this patented "optimization" without license, and that they were blocking updates  to the protocol (to wit, Segwit) so they didn't lose their competitive edge, and spreading FUD far and wide to throw people off the scent.
And your "free market revolution"?  Patents are and will be part of that.  For better or for worse, you'll need to get used to it.

I like your optimism, man!

It's good for historical reference, just in case the article goes offline or is edited.
