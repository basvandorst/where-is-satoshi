Wow. I did Gdax too. I think I chose wire transfer because they said within 24 hours lol.
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:55:26
Transfer from coinbase to Gdax?
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:36:05
cause you can’t sign up currently 
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:52:55
Yes. It is just like sending a payment. You would send it to your new wallets address 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:45:02
why so ?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:13:17
$1 fees are still high. I remember  when they were a few satoshis :(

@_date: 2018-01-03 07:52:18
Gdax is coinbase. I wire transferred money though Gdax.

Just advertising your site 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:04:07
unfortunate to hear man :( good luck getting this resolved. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:35:09
I’m guessing you are being sarcastic. It is annoying once it happens to you. Coinbase has grown drastically in the last few months and they have not done a good job adapting to a bigger user base...   
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:06:46
With a $1k set up you’d be lucky to make $100 a month. $100 would be absolutely amazing and that could happen if bitcoin soars up that same month you mine you’d be lucky to make $500 with 10k set up. $2500 is not that easy. If it was that easy everyone would be doing it right? Investment return in 4 months and profit after that? Sign me up lol. Just think logically man 
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:33:48
I’ve called before and the automated message said they cannot discuss anything relating to bank transfers :(
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:45:34
ACH transfers are fine wire transfers are not 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:28:54
Just promoting your site niceeee 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:11:22
Problems are not happening to everyone. If you used ACH I think you will be fine. Hope you have no issues with your transfer mate !
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:47:56
How much did you get fee’d? Are fees high for ACH transfers
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:56:04
ACH transfers right ?
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:58:56
Wire transfers. Use ACH
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:51:04
good for you man
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:40:21
its completely different. You don't get robbed when you convert bitcoin to fiat because you only pay when you have profits. Crypto to crypto is for every trade between 2 different coins .
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:12:54
no I have chase bank
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:45:12
No I don’t think you got lucky. They have not always been like this until very recently. That is how their service was and how it should be still 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:00:39
It’s definitely not amazing. Lots of people have issues with it. You are just fortunate enough not to experience these issues  
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:43:42
No you are not the only person who has never had a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:01:17
I feel you :( I wanted to cash out money. Buy somethings I want and buy back in a little bit for alt coins 
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:26:27
fraudulent? alright dude lets be serious. Bitcoin.com is a website you can buy bitcoin and it is not fraudulent. Bitcoin.com owners support a fork of bitcoin known as "bitcoin cash" over the traditional "bitcoin" They wouldn't steal your money and bitcoin from you. This guy is trying to scare you for using a website he doesn't like. You should be fine. I would put more detail into your post to get better help. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:30:04
Oh mb. I’m 17 too but I had my parent make me a coinbase account so I can use it. I’d advice to do the same 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:01:45
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:54:47
thank you for that website! I will check it out 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:27:04
Yeah. I’m hoping the lightning network gets implemented soon
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:08
No I’m 100% serious. My isp blocks searching on this subreddit 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:43:28
is filled with sales men
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:04:30
question: why do people always go off the prices of gdax and not these exchanges ? Are these exchanges risky to use ? Also is bitcoin arbitrage trading not possible because of fees?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:16:16
Ledger wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:30:56
Ah I see, I’d recommend local trade for lowest fees. Haven’t tried yet myself but I’d like to when I have money .
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:27:00
thank you for your help !
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:02:32
Very insightful. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:13:09
It was better until bitcoin was flooded with a bunch of new people 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:23:12
Not at all. I just wish all the new people understood what they are spending their money on. People just buying bitcoin for a “quick buck”. People selling houses, cars, and going into their retirement funds for bitcoin. It is so bad right now considering I have to do a $10 transaction fee to send $1. Unusable 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:13:46
Search bar ?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:09:00
oh, Also is bitcoin arbitrage trading not possible because of fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:28:20
Buy from gdax. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 04:52:34
Bought this car with the money I made from having bitcoin from like 2015. I cashed out when the price was around 17k and was able to buy this car cash. Not anything crazy but it is something I appreciate. Starting college this fall semester and I am glad I have fun daily driver with good gas mileage. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:15:57
I am really considering buying again later today. FOMO is hitting me right now
