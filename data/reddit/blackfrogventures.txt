The hardest part about the process was navigating the regulations in each state and developing an anti-money laundering program that complies with federal/state regulations. It took us about 3 months and tens of thousands of dollars spent purely on legal before we could launch our first ATM.

Transactions under $1500 per day require just a phone number - for transactions between $1500 and $3000 per day  we need phone number and ID scan.

This is actually the 2nd ATM installed in Pittsburgh. We installed one 6 days earlier at Quick Stop on Liberty Ave.
Our ATM is a 2-way ATM (buy and sell), and has slightly better fees.
Plus, we are currently buying coins at the ATM **above** the market spot price.

We did many test transactions after installing the machine, and I can say that there is essentially no delay whatsoever. The coins are sent immediately once the transaction is completed on the kiosk.  You can literally see the coins hit your wallet in ~1-2 seconds. :)

Those are our current prices. I believe we are currently the lowest priced ATM in the Cleveland metro area.
