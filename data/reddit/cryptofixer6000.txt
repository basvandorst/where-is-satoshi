The way you speak, it's silly... you can **never** conclude anything with certainty when trying to analyze past price trends, no matter how big the sample size. There is **zero** correlation between price trends and any future result. There is a momentum effect in price increases and decreases, but that's because people who are dumb enough to focus on price trends tend to buy when prices rise and sell when they fall.

It seems, but it's wrong. This is total cherry-picking at its worst. It selects 99% cash because in 2018, cash (-2% return) had a better year than the S&amp;P 500 (-4% return). They do this because it masks bitcoin's 80% loss in 2018, so they limit bitcoin's exposure to just 1%. So, they try to make the idiot within us believe bitcoin is better than all other investments, when it clearly is not. Also, there's no such thing as "interest on your cash." You have to take some amount of risk with your cash to beat inflation.

No, they don't deal with probabilities. That's really stupid. They deal with speculative trends. There are no probabilities in speculative trends. And yes, *ZERO* correlation.

You are so wrong. Ask anyone who knows anything about investing and they'll tell you price trends and so-called technical analysis are no better at predicting price than flipping a coin. There is so much data to back this up. It does not deal with useful probabilities that have any predictive properties regarding price. That's why MacAfee is going to eat his dick next year when BTC doesn't hit a million... and also why the vast majority of investors think it'll go to zero or near zero. If there was any predictive quality in trend analysis, computers would have converged on the correct answer every time by now, and nobody would have to do any work. By definition, a whole shitload of predictions need to be wrong in order for a few to be right.

I understand you don't like fiat. Bitcoin is massively risky. There is a very good chance it goes to zero. It might go to 20k again, but that's looking very unlikely.

Actually, I didn't fail to mention that. That is the tool the fed uses to mitigate crashes, and it's also the tool it uses to reduce inflation. The fed prints money, and the fed BURNS money. You don't store cash as an investment. You had to deploy it, whether you spend it or invest it, that's the point of a currency. You see no way of bitcoin going away?? Look around you son. 80% decline in one year. 20% weekly swings like it's routine. And miners are dropping like flies.

They need to have an advantage over bitcoin, which they don't. They are more volatile, less mainstream, and have lost much more in value this year. Anything that loses 90-97% value in one year can be thought of as a catagorical failure. Btc has only lost 85%. Regular failure. Not catagorical yet.

You're dodging the main issue. If the price of bitcoin eventually stabilizes, and then steadily starts increasing in value due to limited supply, then people are disincentivized to use it as a currency. This hodling period is not going to end. Don't take my word for it. Just look at gold. When it was used as currency, it was hoarded like crazy and became so illiquid that it wasn't practical anymore. It functions well as a value store, and that's bitcoin's best hope.

I see a lot of projection here. I totally accept all factual assertions when it comes to the dollar. I have absolutely not come on here to defend it. You, on the other hand, attempt to discredit me with a pointless initial snipe (redditor for a week) as if that has any bearing on what is being said.
This wasn't a conversation about money versus currency. You insert this Red Herring for no reason other than to try to get an upper hand in this, debate? Your belittling tone suggests you are compensating for a lack of real knowledge when it comes to these things.  And I'm glad you have the ability to look this up in wikipedia. But again, it has nothing to do with anything. Bitcoin price is not established based on its usefulness as currency or money. It's purely speculative. I.e., based on how much think they can sell it for later.
Are you woke yet? Try very hard next time to not rummage through a basket of fallacies when constructing your next argument. You sound very naive and amateur. 
Technological advancements in bitcoin are not correlated to its price. If you hadn't learned that already, you're a bigger idiot than you appear.
P.s. - I'm not sorry you are having a difficult time with bitcoin's 80% crash in less than a year. It's really sad that you actually think it'll go back up. It's denial, delusion, an unwarranted superiority complex, and you just being a snide punk. I'm glad I got a nerve. You need to understand that you're wrong, naive, and an idiot.

Are you thinking that because more bitcoin is being mined, that makes it inflationary? That makes some sense, but it's a bit off. Think of it more like gold as a currency. Without USD or other currencies, its limited supply, even though it is being mined, makes it deflationary. With currencies, it's price fluctuates due to price speculation. Same with bitcoin. Gold would be a deflationary currency, just like bitcoin.

I actually would love to see it adopted. But, realistically, there is nobody using it as an actual currency. USD is liquid and disincentivizes hoarding because of inflation. That's why you have nobody "hodling" or accumulating USD. Btc, by design, is deflationary, which incentivizes hording (or hodling) and disincentivizes its use as a currency. This why you all are hodling and not using it as a currency. It's bitcoin's fatal flaw. Sorry if that's offensive. Btw, There is no good way to short btc, otherwise I would probably have done it one year ago.

Actually, futures contributed to bitcoin's crash and continued downfall. Futures are about price guarantees versus price speculation. Miners buy futures to guarantee a profit, but might miss out on more profits. Right now, the cost of mining is battling futures prices of bitcoin. For most miners, it's lose lose. They can buy a future contract that locks in a loss, or they can keep mining hoping to break even. That's not a good place to be for bitcoin.

Regarding shorting, not quite. Proper shorting is being able to find an entity that is willing to lend out bitcoin, for a small fee, so that the short seller can sell them immediately in the hopes that they can buy it much lower later on. There has not been a good short method for bitcoin to this day. A future contract is just locking in a price to mitigate risk, which is only really viable for miners. I think you're thinking about it the right way though. Appreciating the risk. I strongly advise not to keep hopes up for an ETF. Good luck brother

@_date: 2018-12-04 15:15:13
Yes. Amazon stock was very much like BTC back in 2000. It had no earnings, and was a purely speculative investment. That's why it became a bubble. Now it has massive earnings and the market treats it like a real company. Not gonna happen with bitcoin. Bitcoin will never generate cash. 
Housing market: speculative frenzy caused it to crash. Once the banks and people who couldn't afford their houses were removed from speculating, the market corrected, and eventually the prices bounced back. 
Bitcoin: Pure speculation. Do you not understand that there is no possible way to gauge a normal price for it? That's why you were saying $1 million last year and now you're trying to defend it at $3800. There is no corrective price action, only greedy fools getting to sell to greater fools and a few hopeful believers that are frankly insanely naive about investing.
Fiat currencies are being used as designed... as CURRENCIES. Unlike bitcoin. You can use the little fiat you have to buy anything that is legal to purchase, including bitcoin. If you are using bitcoin as a currency, you'd be part of barely a handful of people doing it. The rest are hording, which is naturally what happens with a deflationary asset.
So, you don't know what you're talking about, your thinking is completely backwards, and you're very insecure about your lack of knowledge..., referencing playing with dolls. That's unfortunate. You should start learning.

Debt was higher after WW2. The Stagflation era of late 60s through 70s inflated a lot of it away, before the Fed shot up rates in early 80s, causing a recession, but also stamping out inflation. Then the Reagan boom happened, and decent fiscal policy to match the Fed's monetary policy.  then the Clinton boom happened where we ran surpluses, which were handed to the rich by Bush's tax cuts. The recession happened and Obama ran up deficits to jump start the economy while the Fed deployed QE. It worked, and the economy has been booming. The Trump administration and Republican Congress have turned their backs on solid fiscal policy to give more money to rich people. They're criminals imo. Good fiscal policy when the economy is booming would entail eliminating deficits, and running surpluses like Clinton did. We're doomed for another era of stagflation because of Republicans, since they've committed us to massive deficits and shattered our ability to deal with another recession without a debt crisis. The dollar will live on, but like always, it will devalue through inflation, and the debt will reduce. The way people made money in the 70s was through investments in blue chip stocks and municipal bonds, which gave a guaranteed return of ~7% back then. As rates keep rising, bonds will become more attractive. You can be clever with your money. I wouldn't count on bitcoin to replace the dollar. It's not a good currency

Gold is not trying to be a currency. If bitcoin is simply a value store, then that's great. It works.

In our economy, your spending is someone else's income. When you spend less and hoard currency, that's a lot less income. Probably around half the jobs we have now would be gone. Not a good thing.

I really like this post, but I think a few elements need to be added. Bitcoin is meant to be a currency, but it's deflationary by design. I know Satoshi meant this to be a different purchasing vehicle where banks are irrelevant, but the huge advantage of modern day currencies is that they're inflationary. It is horrible knowing that the money you earn is constantly being devalued, but that incentivizes putting that money to work, through spending or investing. A deflationary currency incentivizes hodling, accumulation, hoarding, whatever you want to call it....  it doesn't move society towards wealth building. I personally want poor countries to get wealthier, and bitcoin can help people in nations that are poorly managed to keep their wealth (if it stops crashing). But as a currency it's doomed.

Stop wasting your time trying to predict the price. It's wasted effort. Unless it's just fun for you. Then admit that it's fun, but don't get sucked into "technical" analysis. These people named it that to sound smart, but drawing lines and searching for price trends should only be done by monkeys, since it's the same as throwing shit on a wall and any prediction resulting from it is as valuable as a big brown turd.

Yeah, just ignore everything that looks bad and focus only on your rosy delusions.... right. If, you took any of my savings and invested it in something that declined by 80% in one year, I'd sue you and win. I know how fiat currencies work, and I'm telling you, you don't save fiat currency to make money. You spend it or invest it. That's how a currency works. Get it yet? Do you not understand this? A deflationary currency (e.g., bitcoin) incentivizes hording as opposed to its actual use as a currency. What do you think "hodling" and "accumulation" are? It's just hording with a different name. That destroys a currency. Think about it.

You wouldn't necessarily die. Also, like I said, the currency's deflationary nature disincentivizes spending and induces hoarding. You would buy needs, but not much else since your money is also an investment generating positive returns. It's difficult to sell a stock now when you know it'll be worth more in the future. So, that means a lot less jobs..., 75% of which are in the services industry.

$100 in 1970 is worth $618 today. That's not 99%. But, it is a lot. That's why it's smart to invest your savings. The S&amp;P 500 was at $80 in 1970, and is now at $2700.

@_date: 2018-12-06 04:50:25
No... there was none of this chatter last year. The price was above $10k and nobody HERE thought it would crash. There was hindsight wishing about buying at 4k BEFORE the bubble. Now that it's burst, it's tough to convince regular folks that it will come back. Lightning doesn't strike twice often.

You will get downvoted, but you're right. There are none. These people don't even know what this stuff means. They're trying to sound intelligent, but I've seen over and over again that it's all a front. They feel like they know everything, are unwilling to learn, and spout nonsense about investing that sounds smart.

I don't know how people are shorting bitcoin. There is no real easy or safe way to do it. I don't think it's being shorted like you think. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:20:25
I think that's where you'd need money most. Money is a hedge to problems. 
Also, I thought this was bitcoin's whole purpose. If shit goes down, world financial collapse, retirement accounts vaporized, people desperate and hungry..., all the bitcoin folks would be living large with their lambos  and mansions. "Bigger problems than money" makes no sense.

Besides your bank's 1.5%, There are no guarantees. The people giving you guarantees are full of shit. An index fund is probably your best bet. Btc is not. The people telling you to put it in BTC are the same people that would've told you to put it in BTC at 11k, or 8k, or 6k... 70%, 60%, or 45% losses. You'd be screwed. I go with a roboadvisor (wealthfront) for most of my savings. It tax-loss harvests, which makes the fee negligible, and diversifies completely based on risk tolerance. If you want good, reliable returns, don't gamble on bitcoin.

What would be the purpose? This is sort of like wanting an Apple ETF. Why buy it and pay the expense ratio when you can just buy Apple stock and not pay. People can go on any number of exchanges and buy bitcoin. Why pay more to buy an ETF? It kind of reeks of people wanting to recoup losses because they believe an ETF would give Bitcoin more legitimacy for institutional investors, but it won't. Institutional investors aren't brainless automatons that just throw money at things, especially speculative bubbles, hoping they will make money. An ETF might fool a few people, but it won't make any bit of difference, and it would delegitimize bitcoin as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:10:22
I don't think you're correct. Deflationary currencies induce hoarding. Why would you pay for goods with something you know is going to be worth more in the future? What's funny is, it's already happened. You all are hoarding it and you don't even realize. What do you think "hodling" and accumulation mean? You seriously think there will be some magic time in the future where, poof, all of a sudden people start using it as a currency? Talk about asinine.

In 1912, people would have all their savings in a local bank, and when it went bankrupt, you lost it all. FDIC and the Fed, for better or worse, created a situation where that would not happen. The game you're talking about is the game of trying to stop irrational market black swans from destroying regular people's lives. Yes, it is taken advantage of by big banks and profiteers and thats something I had hoped, in the past, that BTC would fix. But, it's not going to fix it. Better to find a solution within existing structures, because this cryptocurrency fad is just not going to do it. With the price so low, you have miner consolidation that looks suspiciously like centralization. That's not the solution. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:14:48
This does not compute. You can replace mining with anything that uses power. It's completely arbitrary. Use the power for raising chickens and then sell the chickens. Use the power for fixing cars. Use the power to raise puppies. It doesn't matter. If green energy gets cheaper, people will just switch to it. Duh!

This is a horrible lesson for investing, and has been happening in stocks for hundreds of years. These people trying to time the market, thinking they know when the right time to buy versus sell, are overwhelmingly the losers. I saw this same rationale when btc was at $11k, then again at $8k, then again at 6.5k, 5.5k, 4k, and now at 3.5k. It's always a buying opportunity, except you lose every time. The poor bastards that watch this and buy, then lose 50%, will not feel good.
