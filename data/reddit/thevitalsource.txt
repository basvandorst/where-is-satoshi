I find it sad when people are afraid to let someone speak. 
I find it sad when you can convict someone here and then deny him the opportunity to defend himself.
I once thought we were free thinkers but I guess that we all live in our own little box whether we support or condemn him.
I love crypto and I love truth but truth has to allow both sides t ok present their evidence and be allowed to stand up to the tests we present from all perspectives

If you boycott, the media will say that it is because Bitcoin is dieing and not because of Garza. 
There are some things that he claims about his coin that might be good for a legitimate coin and it could inspire someone to do something good for Bitcoin.
If we are the ones who expose the scammers in public it also makes the media respect us more as legitimate rather than complaining when they supposedly expose something without knowing anything about what they are writing about.
I do not know about Garza's scams and would like to learning especially because I was looking into putting some money into mining n thee cloud but with my head on solid knowledge.
Just a passing thought.

With coinbase being regulated, will they be watching what we say?
You know who THEY are.

I constantly get emails from my bank telling me to click on the link and change my password . . .
My Rule 1. Never discuss financial information over the phone unless I originated the call or can ask what branch they are at and can call them back unless I know the person, trust them and am willing to discuss the information.
One way that hakers get information is through searching records and then asking just 1 or 2 questions to fill in the gaps.
