Thanks for the answer. I guess in the end, we have to agree that we disagree, however just some additional thoughts to your remarks to make my point clear: 
As to "the governments have watched so far": They've watched, in my opinion, as Bitcoin isn't relevant at all at this point and they are simply hoping that this "thing" will disappear by itself. However, if Bitcoins worth really goes up to $10.000 and even more, I'm pretty sure this behavior will change soon. If only to get their taxes from all the profits Bitcoin holders can so easily disguise because of its anonymous, decentralized form.
As to "Argument from ignorance": I wrote that a prediction of Bitcoin becoming the "leading Internet currency" can certainly be true, but contains no relevant dimension and scale for me at this current state - the last part of the sentence is no ignorance, but simply coming from the fact that being the "leading Internet currency" isn't really defined at the moment in terms of how big this will be. As we are arguing about the chances of mainstream success of Bitcoin (and therefore its valuation still is about $450 and not $10 or so, as these hopes are priced in), my only criterion what "leading" means is: real-life use, Internet vendors accepting it, buyers paying with it. I'm talking about "Amazon accepting Bitcoin" kind of stuff (and people really USING this) which defines REAL Internet currency success to me. At the moment, Bitcoin already IS the leading Internet currency. Not a huge thing though in real-life. This certainly can become much more bigger - but will still stay a huge difference of dimension to the prediction "It will replace the USD". I'm willing to go with you with the "leading Internet currency" one, even a few dimensions more relevant than it is today. (Okay, to the precise: I also don't believe this, but this certainly can be a possibility.) I'm NOT willing the believe the "Will replace the USD" one.
And about the claim that I am a "fanatic rationalizing ideas": I'm pretty sure the Bitcoin enthusiasts here can at least be accused of this very same behavior. In my mind, to a much higher degree.
Let's time be the judge who was right and who was wrong.

Because it would still be much too volatile and manipulable by relative short sums at the current market cap. It's the REASON why we get those crazy bubbles all the way up and down.
@_date: 2014-05-10 06:40:02
Personally, I think Bitcoin will fade away a LOT sooner before the described scenario is here and never even closely become a threat for banks. Within the next five years at the latest. But we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:33:02
If Bitcoin really has replaced the USD as the new standard currency in 15 years (Fun fact: it won't) ... You can be confident enough that it WILL see a 10.000% annual growth again soon.

If you take one wise-sounding quote from the (successful and surely REALLY wise) Waren Buffett as a "prove" for your own investment (buying Bitcoin), but at the same ignore the other quote from the very same Buffett – "Bitcoin is a mirage" – which totally DESTROYS the point you wanted to make by "collecting" his words, you are just making yourself the world like you want to see it, nothing more.
EDIT: Sorry for maybe sounding a bit harsh. Only discovered after sending this that you also posted the original post. Didn't want to sound rude, thought I was speaking to some third guy defending it.

It funny that delusionists like OP really think the banks and governments of this world are right now trembling with fear and shitting their pants because of the unstoppable, powerful threat of Bitcoin. They are probably laughing their asses off when hearing about this. And, unlike the Gandhi quote, it will stay this way.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:17:19
Of course, a person can be right about one thing and wrong about the other - however: "Raping" Buffetts quote which originally referred to a *totally* other, much more concrete kind of investment (blue stocks etc.) *and* ignoring that Buffett also has explicitly said: "Bitcoin is a mirage" – that's a bit absurd, I think ...
If I said: "Leadership is an important thing" and "I hate Hitler" – would you cite my first words to prove that what Hitler did was very important?

If you consider those who build businesses around the infrastructure of Bitcoin smart, you are implying that it will succeed and become a more mainstream thing. In this scenario, buying and holding BTC inevitably has to be smart, too, as the Bitcoin price still has to multiply a lot of times to provide the stable currency for this to work.

You see, that's exactly the problem with a lot of you Bitcoin enthusiasts (to put it nicely) - you take the upcoming worldwide success of Bitcoin as a granted law of nature to that point that you even can't comprehend anymore the total validness of an argument as simple as u/mutecow has worded it: Some people, unlike you, believe that the Bitcoin hype will die (actually, it's already in quite deep sleep at the moment) and Bitcoin won't ever become mainstream. A valid, rational argument can be as simple as that. Arguing the "Why should Bitcoin price plateau before the adoption has peaked?" way totally shows that you start your thoughts with a "fact" which isn't nearly safe yet, but without having even one slight doubt that you are correct and the skeptics are just dumb idiots who don't understand Bitcoin. You are already a huge step too far in your argumentation.
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:12:53
Fair enough. I was implying that we are talking about business who specifically create Bitcoin services. If you mean involvement in general crypto currency infrastructure which works universally, you are correct.

If you think that Bitcoin will have replaced the USD as the new standard currency in 15 years (again: It won't, you are crazy and I am just having fun with you ...), it surely *won'*t happen the way of 14 years of price stagnation (like at the moment) and then, within one year: BOOM!!! If Bitcoin has replaced the USD in 15 years, this MONUMENTAL rise will start VERY soon, and you should probably see your 10.000 percent annual growth at least one or two times again within the next five years ... (Disclaimer: You won't.)
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:54:04
My pleasure. I question the very basic premise - that crypto is the better money for 99% of all people. In my opinion, they won't see enough advantage (to be more precise: ANY) preferring it over banks, credit cards, PayPal - on contrary: Bitcoin has a LOT of trust issues, it's incredible that even *I*, as a quite tech-savant guy, get sweaty when thinking about having to create paper wallets on Ubuntu systems which, to be totally sure that my Bitcoins won't be stolen, have never been on the Internet before, having to be frightened that the Bitcoin exchange I use will get hacked/closes down with my coins etc. pp. You will say: Bitcoin is only doing its first steps, it's like the Internet in 1995, everything will change, become easier for Joe Average etc. I say: The Bitcoin hype/momentum with all its hopes to become mainstream will be long over and lost by then. And even if it already *was* the same comfort and security as for example PayPal / credit card / whatever today: 99% of all people wouldn't see the advantage to switch using Bitcoin, and to be honest: There isn't ... (And please don't come with the "low fees" argument.) I know that Bitcoin tech enthusiasts repeat the "Bitcoin has so many advantages and will make the world better" mantra as long to themselves until they believe it from the button of their hearts, but it doesn't change the fact that this doesn't apply to the majority out there.
I guess we simply have two basic different opinions of the future of Bitcoin which only time can tell who was right ...
Furthermore, even if I don't believe in a mainstream success of an unregulated, decentralized crypo in general, there's also is the second unknown if - if I am wrong and such a crypto currency really makes it - Bitcoin really stays the leader or another, improved crypo takes over. (But that's the much smaller problem, I think. The main problem - see above.)
As I have already posted somewhere else: The problem with discussion with a lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts is that they take the upcoming worldwide success of Bitcoin as a granted law of nature to that point that they even can't comprehend anymore the total validness of an opinion that Bitcoin could fail as a mainstream thing because of the things described above. Ridiculous.

@_date: 2014-05-07 18:12:34
Well, we probably could argue about that forever without coming to agreement - however, in my mind and as already stated, the original Buffett quote was related to some total different kind of investment and therefore can't be simply transfered to whatever context I would like it to fit. If Buffett meant his "be greedy when others are fearful" universally, I should also, for example, have bought high risk new economy stocks in 2001 when they crashed from 100 dollars to 20 dollars - and now are worth a few cents ... I'm pretty sure Buffett also didn't meant THIS. 
Sometimes, it has its REASONS why people are being fearful and something crashes, and these reasons behind it can be totally rational - definitely something Bitcoin people should at least think about before buying "cheap coins" just because they already were much more expensive before. I'm hearing "cheap coins" here all the way down from $800 ...

Exactly. As a customer, I never ever consciously stumbled upon any fees for paying with my credit card etc. And as I am sure the big, relevant merchants wouldn't pass on possible saved fees to me as a customer (=selling me the product cheaper) I don't see any advantage for the mainstream waiting for the possibility to pay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:50:03
If Bitcoin replaces the USD, It needs to be worth a LOT more than today - simply to be able to function this way. (Combined with stability, of course, which would come with it.)

What's the point of your statement? OF COURSE, it would be in the top 10 because of the gigantic gains in such a short time.

@_date: 2014-05-08 06:46:55
I don't think it will happen, because even if there was the SLIGHTEST chance - besides all technical hurdles, trust issues etc. - the US government (and other governments, too) and banks simply would prevent such a world change and they have all the power to do so. These two things are often mixed up, here: Yes, they probably won't be able to "destroy" the Bitcoin as long as the Internet works the way it does. But they sure as hell can prevent a mainstream success, let alone, becoming it the new standard currency replacing the US dollar - they simply need to ban Bitcoin as an official instrument of payment for vendors etc. (could even still keep it legal to own and trade) and this "it will replaces the USD" thing is over. Just like that. Do you really think for just a *second* the governments of this world will watch or even help making a decentralized, anonymous (= not controllable money-laundry heaven) the standard currency?! The "There's nothing they can do about it" voices here may be idealistic and really want to change the world to something better, but even if they quote the Gandhis "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you ..." 24 hours a day - at the end, they will BURY you in this case. Sorry for maybe sounding a bit harsh, but I'm as passionate about telling Bitcoin enthusiast to at least open their eyes as the Bitcoin enthusiasts are to tell skeptics that they are too dumb to understand the power of the idea behind it.
If Bitcoin will have replaced the USD in 15 years nevertheless because there's nothing the governments and banks can do about it, I definitely will be here 2029 and admit that I lacked all the phantasy in the world.
"Leading Internet currency"? Yeah, that could be possible. But what does this mean anyway? This contains no relevant dimension and "scale" for me at this current state. Again, even in the future, it surely won't be anywhere near as big as a role as e.g. the USD.
My prediction: In 5-10 years, Bitcoin and how it "revolutionized the money system and changed the world" will be the biggest running gag on Reddit ever, constantly used as a joke cross reference in the comments. (Except maybe for where a few left hardcore believers will still dream ...)
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:06:01

Don't be delusional. The majority of these buying are investors and private people in hope getting rich quickly with a speculation/gamble, not because they support the idea behind Bitcoin, plan to pay with them, whatever.

Just calculate how much profit you've already made with your cashed 5 BTCs and how much you are willing to risk with your 7 BTCs still left. Please don't stay in because you think will be able to cash out anytime with a drop of $100 max just because you keep an good eye on the current price. This probably won't work and BTC is such a risky, volatile gamble, it could drop 30, 50 or 80 percent within a few minutes, just imagine the news that hackers found a security hole or that the government plans to permit this crypto currency. Your last sentences really sound a bit naive, sorry, please be careful with your money.

As I have said above, nobody here can give you a sincere answer to this question. Please ... Do you really think making money ist so easy that you could just ask somebody how much a currency/stock will be in the future and he/show knows it?
Quoting myself from above:
"That said, nobody here on this forum knows what will happen. The bubble could burst in one minute. The hype could go on until 2.000, 5.000 and 10.000 dollars and THEN burst. Or Bitcoin could REALLY go mainstream and there was no bubble. My guess is as good as others guesses - at least I have to say this as a fair sportsman, the secret truth is, of course, that I consider my guess this whole thing will blow up in Redditors face (the rose-colored glasses won't protect) as much better and smarter than the euphoric "Bitcoin will never crash, to the moon!" shouts. Always be suspicious when THIS starts and when people start to claim that something will never crash again.
My advice is to be careful (your personal consequences of this can differ, dependent on at what price you've bought), but in the end you have to make up your own decision."

If Bitcoin REALLY establish itself as a digital, mass-accepted currency taking a significant share (which still is a long, long way), and doing all this at quite a impressive speed - well, in this case 100.000 dollars by 2020 indeed sound possible to me. Buy again, the "IF" at the beginning is big as a skyscraper ... My personal opinion is that if one day big companies like Apple, Amazon or eBay really start to accept Bitcoin, the Bitcoin fanboys won their bet.

I agree with you, however, the current scenario you describe frightens the "normal" Joe Average too much in comparision to an old school bank account, I think. Add some news in the paper about online money theft and they picture hackers cleaning their hard-earned Bitcoin savings. I think the normal people feel much safer with normal online banking, PayPal etc. (If this is correct or not, I can't say). When the day comes that larger, trusted and well-known companies store your Bitcoins like a bank (and probably even insure them), this can become different, of course. (At least if there's the option to decide to go this way - I'm sure a lot of more tech-savy Reddit-people do find the idea of Bitcoin currency so attractive because they can AVOID exactly this and take care of their money without the hands of any government, bank etc.)

The technology can work as perfect as it wants - if Bitcoin doesn't gain mass adoption at some point, it's not NEARLY worth the $520 (current price), let alone the ATH or even higher. China made the step to ban Bitcoin which is HUGE. I don't care if you bet on a future where other big countries won't follow, China maybe even lifting the ban someday because they are economically forced to, whatever. You may be right. But to think that the warning voices, ESPECIALLY after the China ban, are just to dumb to comprehend Bitcoin (and even show it in posts) - that's making a clown out of yourself.

I think at some point even the theoretical mind game that there is enough new money, even within a hype, pumped into bitcoins becomes ridiculous. I'm pretty sure this point is reached when expecting 600.000 dollars per bitcoin within the end 2014 (the lastest, cause hey, it could also happen within a month, lol!) But this guy probably expects that in the next weeks, the biggest hedgefonds of this world will buy bitcoins for billions of dollars ...

Try to learn reading - I was talking about my experiences in the new economy bubble time which was around the year 2000 (probably when you were just born). Just wanted to throw this thought in the round as the same could happen to current paper Bitcoin millionaires who don't at least cash out SOME money, too. What you and others do in the end is your/their choice, of course.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:31:20
The childish "downvoting to prevent additional panic" gave me the idea, yeah. I admit that this GIF post doesn't contribute any argument, but I am sick of seeing even intelligent, well elaborated thoughts downvoted to hell on r/Bitcoin just because they have a critical tone. Sorry if I overreacted in your case.

If it never goes back to $1000 and above, he actually HAS - just doesn't know it for sure yet and can still hope.

I am waiting for a pop down to get in. Maybe I won't get the chance anymore and watch this thing running away. Wanted to buy big at $800, but my account verification took until today ... :( Whatever, maybe it also will turn out the other way around and I will be HAPPY that I couldn't buy when I wanted to. Only time will tell.

Your chart looks temping to buy cheaper in the near future, though.

"Why this is a good thing" is my very favorite r/Bitcoin comment on every negative news EVER.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:10:39


Yes, that is the point. If you believe that Bitcoin will become mainstream success, it probably will go up to $1000 and above again. I don't deny that. However, ruling out the possibility that it won't, is ridiculous. Just because one Bitcoin is more than 60 percent less than its ATH at the moment, doesn't automatically make it "cheap". (I hear these "Buy cheap now, probably last chance!" posts all the steps downwards since $1000, by the way ...) Just because it went up every time again in the past, doesn't automatically guarantee this for the future. One of the most common, illogical mistakes on the stock market (and investments in general) is that people hold on to bad investments just because they don't want to sell for less that they have paid for and therefore have to admit to themselves that they made a mistake. Same thing happened in the year 2001 when the bubble bursted and "I'm NOT selling!"-people kept on holding their tech stocks with 10 percent loss, then 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 ... And now they are worthless. Would have still been a better deal to sell with 70 percent loss in retrospect ...
However, if you believe in the mainstream success of Bitcoin - yes, in this case: Definitely hold and wait. But don't make the mistake to not review your investments again when new information - like big countries starting to ban Bitcoin and others may follow - changes the situation. (Or not - whatever your long-term view of the implications of the China thing is.)

I am pretty sure you can buy fractions of stock shares, too, can't you?
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:08:59
True. In this case Bitcoin will stay the very extreme gambler investment like it is today, I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:40:51
"I wouldn't buy stock in the $1000 range."
I don't say that you should buy Bitcoin, but this statement is nonsense as the price of a stock says NOTHING about its validation. They are stocks where one share costs thousands of dollars, just because they haven't done a cosmetic split like others etc. A stock which costs 1000 dollars a share can be "cheaper" (read: more undervalued) than a stock which costs 50 cents a share.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:46:28
What fundamentals?
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:33:55
Yes - Bitcoin with its perfect solid fundamentals behind all the irrational fear is EXACTLY what Warren Buffet meant.
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:22:27
As you correctly consult the P/E as an indicator for the valuation of stocks, you should consult the "market share" as a currency when trying to estimate the current real worth of Bitcoin. Right now, there is NO rational relation between those two, the Bitcoin price is fuled with pure hopes what its role as a new wealth storage / medium of payment and exchange COULD be in the future. Nothing else. Therefore, it definitely can be overbought and overpriced like any stock.

That will be the essential question then: Will enough mainstream people start to trust Bitcoin so that big, reputable "bank services" will create these safe offers - or won't these bank services create safe offers because not enough people trust Bitcoin?

One upvote is not enough for this warning, especially considering the fact that you were already downvoted. This will not end well for the newbies/Bitcoin fanboys (never used this term before, but in this case, it has to) - their money will be stolen by smarter investors / "old money" Bitcoin horders.

Yeah, it DOES rises to new all-time highs after every crash ... until it doesn't.
Don't be stupid. You CAN be right in the end, I hope it for you and me, but the warning voices have good arguments. Our bet on the Bitcoin future is as risky as putting money on red or black in the casino.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:13:53
This probably is near Satoshis dollar net worth in 2015.

So the argumentum e contrario is that staying invested for longer (HOW long exactly?) with your current profits on paper will make you rich? We'll see how this will work out with Bitcoin. I'm curious, too.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:15:00
I guess this would cause the same problem already mentioned. A malicious program on your computer (connected to the Internet) could also access your data on external storage when you plug it in.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:11:06
1000 upvotes for this. I often see "It will go up again, of course, people are so stupid to panic sell!" posts here with the ONLY "logic" behind it: Because it has done so before. Nothing else backing this prediction, just based of what happened before. To sell this as a powerful "argument" - ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:36:03
You mean all those stupid year 2000 bubble idiots who sold their tech stocks on the way down with 30, 40, 50 percent loss instead of delusional waiting and holding until 95 percent of their money was gone? You're correct - history DOES repeat. And fools are easily parted with their money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:37:39

NEVER trust all those "brilliant financial investors" here on Reddit, especially when it comes to Bitcoin. There were a few voices of reason here, unfortunately always downvoted to hell within seconds, though. It's brainwash city in this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:39:35
Thanks OP for trying to bring a voice of reason into this subreddit. As you can see, you are downvoted and attacked like hell for this, which is ridiculous. I always wonder if these people who do this are intelligent pump and dumpers or if they really believe what they write. I fear the last. You probably have to be old enough to already have witnessed when greed got ugly, like 2000 when the new economy bubble popped. You should get VERY careful when "TO THE MOON!" becomes the catch phrase of a financial market movement.
And by the way, even I believe that there is a chance for Bitcoin and I am invested. (And maybe that shows that I am also dumb.) But to be in complete denial that this at least COULD be a giant bubble - that's crazy. "Stopped reading after 'Bitcoin is in a speculative bubble' ..."??? Wow. Just wow. OP has some very valid, reflective thoughts you don't even have to share (although, I have to admit, I personally think you SHOULD), but to be THAT ignorant? Wow again.
Let time tell the whole story. I'm curious as well how the end will be.

@_date: 2013-12-08 00:23:07
So then please explain me why Bitcoin can't be overbought and overpriced by false/exaggerated expectations, media hype, psychological factors etc. like stocks can. What's the difference when it comes to these classic bubble causes?
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:55:39
I voted you back up, so you're good again! :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:40:55
Correct, but please also don't make the mistake to compare this 3-year Bitcoin chart to a stock chart of, let's say, a solid Dow Jones company. It still COULD "crash" the way people imagine, it is a much, MUCH higher-risk "investment" (read: gamble). One fatal bug/flaw found by hackers, US government permits Bitcoin etc. and it could go near zero again within days.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:24:34
I just want the chance to get back in at $800 and I'll be happy. I hope I will still get this chance. (Of course, maybe, when it goes from there back to even $400 or less, I will wish that I WOULDN'T have gotten this chance ..)
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:59:11
Nothing to say against this personal estimate. I don't know if it will turn out correctly, of course (nobody here does), but you've at least made your own thoughts and came to a concrete, if risky guess. That's more than a lot of those "WHERE CAN I BUY BITCOINS?!" guys do who read things like "One Bitcoin will go to $10.000, to $100.000, then to $1.000.000!", the "guy found his Bitcoins from 2009 and now buys penthouse in Oslo" stories and then convince themselves that they have just found the way of easily getting rich. I'm afraid that those will be the losers - there will be dramatic "I have lost all" postings here on Reddit. (Not if they just hold their Bitcoins and your scenario becomes reality, of course.)
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:20:41
Interesting to know. I was under the wrong impression that this - in comparison to stock buying/selling because of facts the public doesn't know yet - currency investment would be legal. Guess not.
EDIT: Obviously not wrong after all, judging by the other comments.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:49:00
I'm not even born yet and already heavily invested in Bitcoin. Should be a great retirement!

@_date: 2013-11-29 17:55:49
"Old money" bitcoin hoarders was just my funny term for those miners etc. who still have thousands of bitcoins from the beginning. THEY are the ones who profit the most by the current bubble (yeah, I call it that) and if they decide to sell big style, they could easily crash the whole thing. People here deeply underestimate how crazy unevenly existing Bitcoins are distributed. That should concern every investor who came late. If you like, google a little bit about this topic.
That said, nobody here on this forum knows what will happen. The bubble could burst in one minute. The hype could go on until 2.000, 5.000 and 10.000 dollars and THEN burst. Or Bitcoin could REALLY go mainstream and there was no bubble. My guess is as good as others guesses - at least I have to say this as a fair sportsman, the secret truth is, of course, that I consider my guess this whole thing will blow up in Redditors face (the rose-colored glasses won't protect) as much better and smarter than the euphoric "Bitcoin will never crash, to the moon!" shouts. Always be suspicious when THIS starts and when people start to claim that something will never crash again.
My advice is to be careful (your personal consequences of this can differ, dependent on at what price you've bought), but in the end you have to make up your own decision.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:55:17
Good point. You haven't really made that money until the moment you successfully cash out. I had to learn this the hard way in times of the new economy bubble which made me millionaire on paper for a few months. There isn't much left of this ... :( Be wiser than me and save profits, guys.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:46:05

If the day one bitcoin is worth 1 million dollars comes in the foreseeable feature, there will be something DEEPLY fucked up in the world by completely crashed traditional systems and/or this million will not nearly be worth the same as a million today. I like to dream and hold on to crazy hopes becoming incredibly rich, too, but come on - let's not be delusional. (And downvote people in this subreddit who even DARE to be sceptical.)
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:25:37
Yeah, I liked all those posts since $1000 dollars downwards in $50 steps: 
"Who would have thought that we will get another chance to buy Bitcoins so dirty cheap, sell dumbasses, sell, so that I can buy all your Bitcoins!!!!!111!!!!"
But fear not - Bitcoin will be $600.000 by the end of next year THE LATEST, maybe already within a month:

Believe me: I also pray and hope that Bitcoin will rise and succeed - nevertheless: Settlement is always at the end (?, don't know if this saying is translated correctly into English) - and all those "jealous and negative people who wanted other redditors to lose money" could suddenly turn out as the voice of reason who warned because they wanted other redditors NOT to lose money. Not everybody expresses concerns just because he/she gets satisfied by having the chance to rub an "I told you so!" in others peoples faces.
