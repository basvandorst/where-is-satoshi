Is there an option to download a wallet in tails? The few wallets I looked at had windows as an option but not tails. Should I just boot back into windows 10 and download tor so I can have a wallet? 
There is an app included with tails called Electrum Bitcoin Wallet. Cool, so I went to click on it and it says "persistent is disabled for Electrum wallet,when you shut off tails, you will lose your wallet, please use when persistent is enabled"
Any experience with tails os?

I still never said anything about buying anything illegal. Therefore there is no illegal talk. Again, quit being a fucking pussy.

Yeah, I just looked at my post history. I still never said I was buying something illegal, what is wrong with you? Are you on a fucking sugar rush??? Why not use tor to buy coins? Also, I'm not using tor just to buy coins, i just switched os. I didn't want to use windows 10 anymore so now I'm running tails. And the default browser is tor. 
I also run an OpenBSD desktop as well. 
Again, I have no reason to lie on a public fucking forum. If I wanted to buy something illegal and take the risk, I can do that. But I'm not.
Me using tor is irrelevant.
I think you are stupid. 
And I think this subreddit is full of fucking weebs

I was asking about buying from local bitcoin and then transferring the btc to Electrum wallet. So I could go back onto the darknet and browse the markets. I mentioned I was using tails and there for tor. I guess people here put you on a watch list if you are on tor when buying bitcoin..
I don't care about it being traced, or maybe I do, but maybe I don't want my btc stolen, therefore I use tails, and store my btc on the encrypted persistent  volume. I use Simple security procedures and everybody pulls our their tin foil hat.

Who said I was doing anything illegal? My question was how can I use my Electrum wallet if I bought btc on localbitcoin. Alot of markets are on the darknet. Not all of them are illegal guys.

How is this off topic? I clearly asked about buying bitcoin,  I never mentioned doing illegal activities. And using tor isn't illegal thank you very much. Jesus Christ I thought this was reddit, not a bunch of fucking sissies

I've been slowly getting parts together for a gaming build. I found some good cards cheap on an onion site. I want to buy it at that price, but I don't have escrow or btc, or monero etc, so I figured it wouldn't be to hard or take to long to set up, I decided to come to reddit for help. 
My mistake. 
Btw, I have been running multiple os, tails, kodachi, arch Linux and Linux mint.
I mentioned tails only because of the built in wallet, but the persistent volume is confusing me and isn't allowing me access to it, even when I unlocked it with a password on boot. 
I don't normally use tails. I'm interested in the wallet that comes preinstalled with tails. Electrum wallet. 
I think it would be a safe option to store my coin .
I bet that space before the period on the last sentence is really bothering you isn't it...

Ok? And it's legal to smoke weed where I live. The fuck are you the fucking police or just some social justice keyboard warrior? Grow the fuck up bud. Also it's money. I can buy whatever I want with money that I own. Just like real cash and coins.

Hmm not much help this time of night. Shoot.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:45:40

I hope you dont go outside like that.
All the best things are on the online markets.
