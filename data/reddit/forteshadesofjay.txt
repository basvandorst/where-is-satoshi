Just zoom in more. I have pixels out the ass. People aren't trained to visualize info in a log scale. Even stuff that we deal with in log scale (like sound for example) people have a really hard time visualizing differences in dBs. Or just change the values from USD to percent change and make it linear. There is a log of relationships people will pickup from this graph that just aren't there.

Lol wat. I have cards I've been running 24/7 mostly at 70% or higher fan for a year plus now and the 1080ti I just got last week is identical in noise. It's just sitting there I'm not off roading with it and eating cheeseburgers in it.
I did but a card with bad fans once and just got some replacements. I'll tell you replacement fans are a straight racket. Each fan is different and the only way to really get a specific one is to buy the set for like 70.

Err meant to reply to the dude above you myb.

What is this scale? $190 halfway of 22k. Looks legit.

Heat is your worst enemy. Reads and writes in flash memory would be second but it's closer to ram than ssd so cycles aren't as big of a deal. Honestly I'm more worried about the fans which aren't cheap but are replaceable. The solid state stuff I'm not really worried about. My cards stay from 55-65c which is well under what they did for gaming.

Orders are frozen. You can't really order now.

How disappointed are you that Lambos don't come with true manual transmissions anymore? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:22
They froze it almost immediately after enabling because of the clusterfuck it caused.

You get your BCH if you had it at the time of the fork. They aren't keeping it. Although people who moved on or BTC they held they get to keep. I don't particularly have problem with the latter. The former is a bit trickier but not huge IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:59:11
It obviously works or the site wouldn't have 60 million to "lose" in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:07
Because it makes your customerbase angry? I mean they could have done it with any coin really. They have the resources and traffic to make this happen to any coin if they really wanted to. My guess is it was just easier with BCH since they had forked coins and the BTC/BCH debate was sure to drive some panic selling/FOMO buying. I'm just made they didn't do it with LTC so I could have cashed in. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:54:14
It climbed to 370ish and been a sell-fest since. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:58:00


@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:20
holeeee fuk I wish I had BCH to sell right now... If the website worked that is. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:30:56
You don't have to. As long as you match fees (1.5%*2 for buy/sell on gdax) you only need to have a 3% drop to come out ahead. Everything else is profit. Capital gains are on profits so if you don't profit you get a credit which only helps. I can see at several key intervals where it will work but do think your average Joe isn't going to beat it consistently.

We all brought knifes to a gun fight and Coinbase pulled in a fucking tank then proceeded roll us. No shit people are pissed. The only way to win this is to not have played. I'm sorry to anyone who bought at those inflated prices. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:57
* Buy BCH
* Announce it and enable trading almost immediately so anyone with funds elsewhere doesn't have time to deposit/sell
* Dump your shitcoin at FOMO prices
* ????? 
* profit 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:27:17
It's basically gambling. You'd have to be delusional to think not a single trader beat the average. I guarantee a good chunk of them did. Even if you get a single one right and then hold you outperformed it. Now I'll say most aren't beating it consistently. You don't even need to time it that well as long as you have a 3% drop you can come out on fees and everything else is profit. Doing it on a consistent basis takes time, effort and luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:44
There is no way this wasn't leaked. The price tanked a bit since yesterday night. Not as bit as it did when it was announce but stuff was shifting well before. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:19:17
Why would buys matter? You could still be holding right now and if BTC crashes to less than what you bought then there were no gains. Do they offer breaks on loses? That one dude who went all in on BCH might need some help. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:19:30
Just buy a couple 1080tis and go to work. If you're taking name suggestions for your miner I'd recommend "mining minor" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:07:52
That's kind of odd that they would post about this though. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:55:26
Lmao. You can hear the disappointment. This is why I don't even touch my shit. I think it will rebound so you should be able to comeback from it at least a good chunk but now you're missing these gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:59:57
I turn around for 10 minutes and miss it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:17:24
Just pulled up a list. Some decent looking places. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:37:28
Reminds me of IsoSwagger on Bamboozle waiting to happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:18:53
Yeah he should just set a coinbase alert for 200 and stock up when it drops back down to that. Much more solid plan.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:29
Delete this. STFU about it. Hope no one ever finds this thread. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:06
I've bought a few. Trezor is super easy to setup and has a decent interface but doesn't have a ton of different coins it supports. If you're only doing BTC it's super easy though. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:43:54
Actually if that thread was posted in any finance subreddit they would probably have the same response he's having. It's a start but nothing to pat yourself in the back for. No one gives a shit about 100 investment unless it increased 100 fold. I doubt it would make it out of the new queue.
