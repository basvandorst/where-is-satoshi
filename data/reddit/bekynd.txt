Is there a guide on how to set up a lightning channel and make a payment (to TorGuard for example) on the main net?

Crypto to crypto trades are taxable events in the United States thanks to new IRS guidelines.

I just cancelled my recurring subscription after being with PIA for years.  This is very disheartening and disappointing.

FYI this isn't true in the US.  All crypto to crypto trades are taxable events now and subject to capital gains tax.

Is there a guide on how to set this all up?

I have a feeling if a good percentage of customers all took their BTC out if coinbase we would find out they are insolvent.

Wouldn't the implication of this be that you will owe taxes on the gains (or losses) from the Bitcoin sale that fuels each purchase you make with the card?

Strange.  I ordered from their official website as well and never got a shipping notification.

Weird, mine still shows 7-21 days and more expensive shipping after filling address 3 with my city :-/

Mind if I ask when you ordered?  Just wondering because I ordered on Dec. 17 and mine hasn't shipped yet..

Wouldn't a cost basis of $0 be the safest for BCH?  If you sold one bitcoin cash when it was $2000 you would be paying taxes on $2000 of capital gains.

Wouldn't a cost basis of $0 be easy to argue?  You'd be paying the most amount of taxes...

In 2009 many people believed bitcoin would revolutionize finance.  Maybe someone feels that same way about something that has just recently been developed.

I am pretty unfamiliar with urbit.  What use case(s) do you believe will make people want to use it the most?
