I haven't tried to buy bitcoins in quite a few years but is it still as much of a pain in the ass (compared to the ease of usage expected from such a site) ? 
A few years ago (I only tried to use Bitstamp) I was asked for my id papers and my banking informations before making the transaction.
I would gladly give $0,01 to content creators if the system was used across the Internet but I won't buy bitcoins for three low res movies.
Thanks a lot for your explanation !

Meh, the blockchain always seemed quite obscur to me, I saw this post and was intrigued but not nearly enough to change my plans for today.

Minecraft has nothing to see with bitcoin, the bitmine is a server hosted by players that use the bitcoins to run (look at here:

You mean they have something like the opencourseware from MIT/Harvard ? I'll look at it !

I don't, I also think it might be a good (and maybe even THE good) alternative to $/€/PlaceTheCurrencyRuledByBanksHere, I said this about the financial aspect/risks to loose everything.

Thanks for your explanations.
From what I learnt in this thread i'm not sure this can happen because of this:  
What is your opinion on it ?

On the other hand, the same chart shows that we are currently pulled away from that baseline, and if you assume that the price will return to that baseline before the baseline rises up to the price, then there's a chance that the short-term price could drop to $50 between now and late September. (You can see the lengths of the previous cycles in that chart.)
Sounds interesting but I don't really understand what you are talking about (as I said before I am a newbie in economy) could you explain a bit please ?

Thanks for your message !
I'm kinda bad in economy infortunatly (I had to choose between math and eco in high school)
If lot of people google "Bitcoin" this mean they will buy some so the price will increase or is it the exact opposite ?
Oh and also I know it's very easy to buy some BTC but is it also easy to exchange them with Euros ? Are the fees important ?

But if I am ready to loose 100% of my coins' value (I would be sad but this wouldn't ruin my life) the bitcoin might be taken as a very fluctuant auction with high risks but high profits possibility no ?
