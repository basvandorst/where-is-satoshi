We can agree to disagree on that scenario.

Yes but to hedge a long they need either an entirely offsetting short, or hold btc.

agreed, decentralization is not an end goal of itself, the goal is censorship resistance. If we can get censorship resistance with 3k nodes while having 2mb+ blocks, that is a rational decision vs. 100k nodes with 500kb blocks and $1,000 btc fees. We just need enough decentralization to prevent censorship.

I thought that the forks would behave like stock splits. Ex. $1k splits to $800 + $200. But when BCH and BTG split, the price of BTC hardly budged. In fact, BTC's price rocketed up before each of these splits. It really was free money.

I think crypto is the new market based glass-steagall because it allows the people withdraw their money from retail banks and park it somewhere relatively safe (not physical cash). Banks will have to compete with crypto in the future, bringing the return of low or no fee accounts, and passing along more of the interest they get on reserves to their customers.
The end goal is to make banking boring again. The banks will have to compete for the people's money. And this is not just crypto but mobile money in the form of venmo, square, wechat pay, and alipay. If banks want to lend out more money, they will have to give better interest rates to compensate the depositors. The banks used to freeload on depositor money and fund their riskier market making and financial gambles. No more.

If fears of a btc futures day 1 dump are over...the moon is the limit. Is the uncertainty gone?

Except if fiat gets devalued and btc rises as a result,  holding the future is wrong way risk.

Deposit USD to coinbase, transfer USD to GDAX, buy on GDAX. 
Only maker-taker fees.

What if CME already accumulated all the BTC they need, prior to activating the BTC futures, like they would do if they were professional and prudent? Sell the news?

Agreed. This is also closer in line to a much needed carbon tax/sharing economy. You got a yacht, big taxes on that. 2nd or 3rd real property? Yuge taxes on that. If you dont own that much, you don't get taxed that much.

What happens if i send BTC from a segwit address to a non-segwit address? Also is there a different prefix for segwit addresses vs non-segwit? Thanks.

What absolutely bamboozles me is that tether is not redeemable for usd. So shady/non-existent audit or not - it doesn't matter. You cannot get USD back for tether. The Bitfinex parent company basically takes the money and issues non-USD backed chuck-e-cheese tokens in return. 
On top of that, Bitfinex is shady (I still haven't learned of an explanation for the most recent hack and subsequent socialization of losses - inside job?), but holds 163k btc in cold storage. How could they possibly be insolvent? Totally bamboozled.

Agreed, but these ICOs raised millions of dollars and could survive for much longer than a regular startup. The $$$ buffer means these projects can bounce along for years. $100M+ means a startup won't run out of money any time soon unless they really mess up.
