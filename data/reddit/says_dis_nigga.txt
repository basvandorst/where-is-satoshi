Wouldn't any nefarious websites be using new addresses for each incoming transaction? How can coinbase connect a new address to something nefarious?

Gavin and the other core devs need to get together, smoke a doob, and work this out.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:00:59
Good write-up.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:06:25
The core devs say it will allow for a 75% increase in network capacity. I'll take their word over yours, no offense. And old school clients still benefit in that, with an increase in network capacity, their transactions are confirmed much more consistently. And I have no reason not to believe that all the major wallet developers will not support segwit very promptly.
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:36:10
I love Gavin, and don't think he is insincere or has a hidden agenda, but I agree with you otherwise. If segwit will give us a 75% increase in block size, let's be patient and wait for that instead of splitting the community over a 0.25M blocksize difference.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:25:54


Bitcoin classic is only a one time increase as well. 


Bitcoin classic would take about the same amount of time to get everyone safely positioned for the hard fork, assuming that process started today, than segwit will take to go live. 


They are blocking a 2mb hardfork, because we have an alternate solution that everyone agrees with that achieves nearly the same result (1.75mb) in network capacity upgrade, along with fixing the malleability bug, and enabling all kinds of future upgrades previously not possible, which bitcoin classic does not provide. Seems like the better choice to me.


That is not true. Getting everyone positioned for the hard fork takes lots of time and preparation.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:38:14
I agree with this. With segwit coming in the near future, it's silly to advocate for a one-time 2MB block size bump via hard fork, when segwit achieves nearly the same thing via soft fork, and is supported by everyone in the community.
Bitcoin Classic may be a good backup plan in case segwit doesn't work out. But until then, the sensible thing to do with wait for segwit.

Depends on the types of transactions in the block.


So, somewhere between 1.6 and 2.0. Hence, 1.75 is commonly used as a reasonable mid-point.
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:02:12
As long as the core devs have a solution for transaction volume and are actively working to bring it to fruition within 2-3 months, I don't understand the huge rush. We've spent a year debating possible solutions, and now have something that everyone agrees with, even Gavin, that will ease the transaction volume issue and reduce average block size. It seems like a reasonable wait to me.
@_date: 2016-01-13 17:48:16
About 3 months before the halving, actually.
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:09:32
Yes I am aware of that proposal and not opposed to it if the data used to determine a 17% yearly growth rate can be cited, reviewed, and found to be valid. Without having the data, it seems too conservative. In my own experience here in the midwest (US), residential bandwidth has increased about 25% a year. It also seems to be following a curve, with premium 75Mb connections currently available and gagabit connections on the horizon. Yet, this proposal follows a linear growth rate.
So, I need to see the data before I can jump on board.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:14:56


No, it's not. And this has been the heart of the debate for months. Not sure why you think you need to restate what has already been debated a hundred times with no resolution.
Bitcoin can scale in tandem with average hardware and bandwidth capacities and there will be no centralization effect.
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:23:22
I agree with what you said, but it's a perfect world scenario and it would be faulty thinking to want or expect bitcoin to evolve that way. We want it to be possible for everyone to use bitcoin, not just those who can run a dedicated node. If connecting to someone else's node is too much of a security risk, then we should be thinking of ways to resolve that issue rather than taking the easy and lazy approach, which is to discourage it altogether.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:08:29
All of these problems you are describing only exist if the increase in block size limit is faster than the increase in bandwidth and storage capacities of the average user. If the block size limit can scale in tandem with these technologies, then theoretically a 1GB block size in 20 years is no different than a 1MB block size today. Just as 1MB today is no different than 1KB 20 years ago, had bitcoin been invented then.
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:11:42
Touche. yes 17% does plot a curve. However, my point still stands, which was that the percentage itself does not appear to be constant in the real world. The percentage of growth year over year seems to be increasing.
I'll see if I can dig up that post to the mailing list.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:36:27


That's fine. He is entitled to his opinion.


I see nothing unintelligent about increasing the block size limit in accordance to the increase in average bandwidth and storage capacities. If done properly, the health of the bitcoin network would be unaffected. It's a simple and elegant solution, and I have yet to hear a valid counter argument that can't be easily poked full of holes.
One thing I've learned from my nearly 20 years in software development is that way too many developers love to over-complicate things when it is not necessary, as if the complexity of a project is proportional to the size of their ego.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:02:08
I don't think he was being literal. He was just making a reference to people of prominence in the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:34:32
How about Satoshi? This method of scaling is outlined in his original white paper. Then of course there is Gavin and Mike, the two main developers behind XT. I hope these three people meet your qualifications as "reliable and well-educated", as subjective as those terms are.
Moreover, having bounced this off a few notable small blockers, including Luke-jr, even they don't deny this method of scaling is possible. Their only concern is determining what the right schedule is, which then becomes a debate in and of itself.
Then of course, there is plain old common sense, which suggests that, given technology can be expected to get faster and cheaper, scaling the blocksize limit accordingly can be done without any change to network health. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:09:59


You're asking me to debate a point I never made. I simply said that bitcoin can scale in other ways that don't require a lightning network.
Personally, I am not opposed to the lightning network. But I am opposed to keeping a cap on the blocksize limit under the guise that "there is no other way to scale" and "centralization!". I believe the blocksize limit should and can scale with storage and bandwidth. I wish the debate was about what that rate and schedule should be, and not about keeping it capped. I am opposed to keeping it capped. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 19:18:56
If that category is "people of prominence" then I would agree with him. He belongs in that category along with core developers. He never said he was a developer or said his option or knowledge on the subject is equal to that of a developer.
That said, this debate is more about theory and philosophy than it is about software development. Given that, I would argue that his opinion is indeed equal to that of a core developer.
@_date: 2015-08-06 19:41:17


As I stated before, on topics of theory and philosophy, the core developers opinions should not carry any extra weight. I think they are giving themselves extra weight by leveraging their position as a core developer, but that is something that should change. This debate is a good opportunity for the community to knock them down a rung or two.
But on topics of implementing a change in the code base, of course their opinion should carry more weight.
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:25:52
How many connections does your node have?
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:15:59
Big blocks aren't a problem as long as the allowable size scales in proportion to bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-08-10 21:14:29


This is the only legitimate argument for small blocks. All others hinge on this being true.
The small blockers think that a recent decrease in full nodes is attributed to the increase in transaction volume. Thus, if we increase the block size limit and allow more transaction volume, the full node count will decrease and we will have a centralization effect.
They say that you can not run a full node on a typical home broadband connection even today, as it hogs too much bandwidth. However, I am not convinced. I just ordered a raspberry pi 2 and a 64GB SD card for about $70, and I plan on putting that to the test soon. If it hogs up my bandwidth connection too much with the default settings, I am confident that by using the maxconnections setting like a bandwidth limiter I can find a comfortable balance while still contributing to the health of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:46:00
Can confirm the IRC sentiment. They are open to a discussion on the topic to a degree, but If you continue to push an opposing view then yes I have seen them ban people. It is clear from reading the conversations on IRC that the devs have no intention of increasing the block size. They believe limiting the block size and artificially forcing high fees, combined with off chain transaction and/or sidechains and/or lightning network is the only future bitcoin can have. 
Edit: I am not even sure that they are wrong. But what I am pretty sure of is that a few of them are often arrogant and narrow-minded, and therefore it is hard for me to trust them to make the best decisions.
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:15:41
Hey look! It's someone with actual ideas to improve bitcoin core, instead of trying to build complex layers on top of it. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 19:42:12
How is it decentralized? It looks to me like 21 serves as the central hub for all listed services and acts as a middle-man to facilitate transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:18:47
Well I guess I could be wrong but I just find it unlikely to be decentralized if they aren't freely and eagerly stating it as such. What information are you going by that gives you the impression it is decentralized?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:00:49


At face value this seems like a fair point. In reality, the problem is that there is an endless debate about what adversarial circumstances exist, how they can manifest, and how critical they may be. This discussion has been going on and on, with one side presenting counter arguments to the other, and back and forth. At some point action needs to be taken. Now it seems, in true arrogant fashion, the core devs have shut the door on any discussion in this area (edit: apparently adam is open to discussions, which must be a new change in policy). They've gone on to defend the censoring of discussions on the topic. Whether right or wrong on the block size issue, their actions are horrible, and they are losing credibility because of it. If they are truely in the right on the block size debate, they've failed miserably at demonstrating this to the general community. Since they can fail horribly with communication, why should we give them credit on the block size issue to begin with?
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:59:52
No. They're just paying for it's development and obviously expect to get some kind of return on that investment.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:44:55


Are you suggesting that BIP101 is "in extremis"? If so, what is your counter BIP? Why aren't you negotiating and discussing options? Why are you constantly shooting down ideas and closing the door to discussions? Why aren't expressing any interest at all to increase the block size?
**Edit**: In what seems to be a change in policy for, at least, one of the core devs, Adam seems to be forthcoming in his communications and willing to discuss the block size issue in a non-condescending and open way. And even seems to be open to a reasonable block size limit increase that's not horribly far off from Gavin's. Thank you Adam, and I apologize if I came off on the attack too quickly, but I hope you understand this sort of communication from the core devs usually doesn't happen. I can only hope the rest of the core devs follow in your footsteps.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:38:36
To be honest, I am not entirely certain he didn't come back and edit his post after the fact, since I replied rather quickly. But i'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I think it speaks to my credit that I can admit as much. Regardless, your criticism is noted. Not that I care whatsoever about what a random guy on the internet thinks of my posts. How about not worrying about my reputation, and worry about the content of the discussion?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:14:24




Ah, I guess i didn't even read that far. This is actually good news to hear.
It will be interesting to see the other core dev's reaction to your BIP, having harshly defended their position that such a block size limit increase is too aggressive.
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:30:23
Tweak the maxconnections parameter to get a little control over your node's bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:07:42
When stress reveals a weak point, ideally you want to strengthen that weak point. In this case, letting weak nodes drop off the network and, over time, replacing them with stronger nodes is good for the bitcoin network. It eliminates that weak point. Which in turn makes the network less vulnerable to spam attacks. Which in turn makes spamming less viable. Which in turn reduces spam.
So yes, I invite mining these resources in to blocks. It makes bitcoin stronger in the long run.

All devices with 21's mining chip and software will have the ability to participate in a marketplace for digital goods and services. It is the selling and buying of these goods and services that is the end game. They are creating a digital marketplace, with a focus on micro-services (but not limited to them), that uses bitcoins as the currency. The mining chip is to give the users a steady flow of bitcoin to allow for continued participation in the market without them having to go through an exchange to refill their wallet. A possible alternate/additional purpose of the mining chip is to give 21 enough hashing power to confirm the micro-transactions, as they will probably be identified as spam and ignored by other miners.


I think the intention is that consumers intentionally choose 21-enabled devices, much like they do with a LTE-enabled tablet. It's an option, not a requirement.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:12:00
You're seriously not even reading my replies. I've already addressed the transaction fee issue.


@_date: 2015-11-02 18:33:29


He explains himself in the blog post. Perhaps read the post and present your counter arguments for the content itself, instead of painting Mike like a conspiracy theorist. His reasoning seems sound to me, but I am open to hearing counter arguments. So far no one has presented any.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:31:54
And the core dev's response will be to use the forthcoming lightning network for small merchant transactions. Very convenient for blockstream.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:32:31
I get why non-technical people might want to buy this. But developers, who I assume are technical, can simply buy a raspberry pi, a case, and a microSD card and build their own node for about $70. Why would they want to buy your device for twice that amount at $150? Or worse yet, at $250?
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:06:04
It's humorous and all but bitcoin is not immune to dishonest lending practices. Bitcoin can be lent in exactly the same way USD or any other fiat currency is lent today. The act of lending is completely separate from the currency being lent. If the IMF wanted to finance wars by lending bitcoin instead of fiat, they surely could. And if bitcoin becomes the world currency, they probably will.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:22:43


I think it is safe to assume he is implying that his statement was in reference to his general opinion on how aggressively we can raise the block size limit, which is encapsulated in his BIP. Your "1GB today" point threw me for a loop too.
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:23:04
Why are you so narrow-minded? Think in terms of the world. Not everyone has the ability to exchange their currency for bitcoin. Nor do non-technical people have the wherewithal to sign up for an exchange and go through the process of buying bitcoin.
And you're ignoring my second point about giving 21 enough hashing power to confirm their market's micro-transactions.

The focus seems to be on micro-services. Things that are fractions of a penny. Until the market becomes a reality, and services start being offered, we don't know how much bitcoin is too small to participate.
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:18:57
Pretty lackluster go-live.
It takes 2 days to verify a bank account, and another 3 days to deposit USD in order to buy bitcoin. Given that their announcement wasn't much more than 5 days before launch, I wonder if it is simply that very few users have funds available to buy at this time. I would be buying but I have to wait 2 more days for my deposit to clear.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:10:35
You seem to be making some kind of assumption that people will be forced in to buying 21-enabled devices. I'm pretty sure that if these mining chips make their way in to cell phones (or whatever), it'll be an option, not a requirement. In other words, people will specifically ask for 21-enabled devices. Those who don't want them, won't be forced to get them as you seem to be assuming.
And the point of the chip is not to just arbitrarily mine at a net loss. It is to allow participation in the marketplace, including the ability to sell services. The participation, it is assumed, will potentially provide enough value as to counter the loss from mining alone.
@_date: 2015-11-02 18:29:07


Uhh,, what are you talking about? You're wrong on two counts:
1. They want to increase the block size *LIMIT*, not the block size. The block size itself is determined by transaction volume.
2. They want to increase it to 8 *MEGABYTES*, not gigabytes.
It has been pretty well demonstrated that this increase will have a negligible effect on home users, both for those who want to use only a wallet, and for those who want to run a full node.
