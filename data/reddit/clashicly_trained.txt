No doubt he bought back in. But probably not nearly what he lost. And difficult to hodl from them until now.

Signature verification is intensive. Think about the chain being an assembly line. Nodes need to verify the incoming block before the next one comes to stay at chaintip. 1-sec blocks are achievable on seldom used chains where the majority of blocks just contain the Coinbase reward. Then there are different transaction types that take more effort to verify.
The success of Bitcoin has to do with decentralization. The lesser requirements on Full nodes, the more nodes that make Bitcoin censorship resistant and unstoppable. The greater the requirements, full nodes drop out and you lose redundancy and start moving to centralized points of failure.
If you are naturally curious how this would be implemented, see this PR 
You can watch a live experiment unfold in 3 weeks. However, remember that Bitcoin has 3 orders of magnitude more transactions than BTCC
