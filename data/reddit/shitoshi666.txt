The second password is needed to send the coins.... even if the attacker was able to steal the backup and brute-force the main password, he would still need the second password to actually send the funds.  This would work if the attacker tried to send within blockchain interface or if he imported the wallet into Multibit.
Someone please correct me if I am mistaken.

Who can brute force not one but two strong 20+ character passwords "extremely fast"?  Serious question.

Did you have the SECOND password enabled on the blockchain wallet?  This would help to know.  Sorry for your loss.

Did you enable the SECOND PASSWORD?  This is very important.

The more information you can give, the more it will help others.

All these comments and discussion but OP still never confirmed if he had enabled the second password to double encrypt the wallet.
I don't understand why this is so casually addressed in all these cases....

The first password encrypts the wallet itself.  The second password encrypts the private keys required to actually spend the coins.  So even if the attacker was able to access your backup, he would have to crack that second password to send any funds out.

The FIRST password opens the wallet, but the SECOND password is required to actually send the funds.
Am I mistaken that even if an attacker has access to your backups from e-mail, he can't move the funds from the wallet without second password??

I know, but we need to help people from falling victim in the future.  So... ONE 12-char weak password vs TWO 20+ char strong passwords... are we talking 10 minutes harder to crack or 10 years?

**If people would just treat EVERY STEP of their relationship to their web wallet with the same care they would treat their desktop client, perhaps a huge portion of theft could be avoided?**
"Failure of education" is exactly it.  I recently posted about web wallet theft.  Every single theft we hear about leaves out massive details... then later in the comment section say "oh yeah, I also use that e-mail for two other exchanges and a bunch of Balkan porn sites".  NO MENTION OF SECOND PASSWORDS EVER.  Responses are just "2FA idiot" or give a 47-step paper wallet process which involves dissolving your printer in acid. No mention of HTTPS or using secure connections.  And oh yeah, SECOND PASSWORD.  Fuck I'm so tired of this.
