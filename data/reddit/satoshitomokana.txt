this is old news! it's not Mochizuki. Satoshi is live and well and is involved in the bitcoin community but Shinichi is not. I highly doubt that people who created bitcoin just left it alone.

I don't blame you Peter.  You can do more damage by simply coding.  Being in jail or in some random country locked in a room doesn't help at all. I mean look at Edward.  what did his sacrifice get us?  
Also powerful xyz is from the Joe rogan podcast :)  that's how I was introduced to bitcoin.  He had Andreas on.

This is exactly why they is room for both. They do different things.  That's like saying a car is completely different than a horse. One uses gas, and it's faster, and louder and lasts longer so no need for horses. Horses are dumb and should be irradiated.

From Gmax :
A month ago I was explaining the attack on Bitcoin's SHA2 hashcash which
is exploited by ASICBOOST and the various steps which could be used to
block it in the network if it became a problem.
While most discussion of ASICBOOST has focused on the overt method
of implementing it, there also exists a covert method for using it.
As I explained one of the approaches to inhibit covert ASICBOOST I
realized that my words were pretty much also describing the SegWit
commitment structure.
The authors of the SegWit proposal made a specific effort to not be
incompatible with any mining system and, in particular, changed the
design at one point to accommodate mining chips with forced payout
Had there been awareness of exploitation of this attack an effort
would have been made to avoid incompatibility-- simply to separate
concerns.  But the best methods of implementing the covert attack
are significantly incompatible with virtually any method of
extending Bitcoin's transaction capabilities; with the notable
exception of extension blocks (which have their own problems).
An incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the
more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining
ecosystem so I began looking for supporting evidence.
Reverse engineering of a particular mining chip has demonstrated
conclusively that ASICBOOST has been implemented
in hardware.
On that basis, I offer the following BIP draft for discussion.
This proposal does not prevent the attack in general, but only
inhibits covert forms of it which are incompatible with
improvements to the Bitcoin protocol.
I hope that even those of us who would strongly prefer that
ASICBOOST be blocked completely can come together to support
a protective measure that separates concerns by inhibiting
the covert use of it that potentially blocks protocol improvements.
The specific activation height is something I currently don't have
a strong opinion, so I've left it unspecified for the moment.

Again. I don't care about your "facts". Nor your poor assessment of them. I disagree with you for plenty of reasons that I don't care to get into. What's done is done. If you think it's a shit coin, then by all means stay away from it. You're not going to change my mind.
