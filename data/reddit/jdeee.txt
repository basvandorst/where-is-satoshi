Awesome! I think it's about time I put one on my business card... When people ask about it I get to turn them on to Bitcoin and also encourage a discount for payments in BTC on the spot. People do love them some tangibility.

I'm getting real tired of people not acknowledging that ALCOHOL IS A DRUG!

Someone just scammed me using Venmo (via localbitcoins), which I assume he signed up for using a bogus credit card. He sent me USD, I sent him BTC. Venmo or CC company reversed the charge. I am an idiot.

An excellent demonstration of the usefulness of stealth addresses (and anonymity in general) for non-nefarious purposes.

You're right! I should have been more clear: LocalBitcoins should not even allow people to put that in their ads, or if they do, then it should trigger some kind of safety warning to the other parties. It is not the fault of LocalBitcoins but nevertheless it still affects their image negatively if they don't try to do anything about it. I hate Venmo right now too, almost as much as myself for falling for this! ;)
Also I didn't even know until now that localbitcoins had a payment provider risk list:
^^^ THIS IS A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE USING LOCALBITCOINS.

Couldn't get past the part about how you don't lock your doors. Might as well put a "free stuff" sign in the window as well...

Also, the questions about what percentage of the world economy uses Bitcoin are not really relevant because it is a nascent currency and we are in the infancy stages... Of course hardly anyone uses it at only a few years old. What Amir should be offering as counterpoint is the percentage of GROWTH and adoption over the past couple years. If he had those numbers on hand that would have ended that part of the debate.

That sounds like a lot of merchants, but how big of a deal is this really? I have barely heard of Shopify so I'm just curious.

Higher temperatures might do damage but 64C is hardly "hot" for a GPU. I know this is anecdotal but I have run several GPUs (Radeon 4xxx, 5xxx and 6xxx series) doing Bitcoin mining 24/7 for over a year and gaming occasionally, and they almost always were running above 90C, sometimes even above 100C.
They all still run fine. It may have shortened the life but probably not by a noticeable amount, at least not from what I can tell. I have seen overclocking abilities diminished on GPUs and CPUs from running overclocked and/or too hot for too long.

I have been using Gox for about two years and I have successfully withdrawn bitcoins many times in under 30 minutes. However just a couple of days ago I had a withdraw to CampbX take nearly 48 hours. I contacted support twice and then it finally went through -- I don't know if they actually did anything though.
I have a feeling their systems are just acting more shitty than usual and taking forever to actually process the request. Knowing their history I wouldn't be surprised if they were purposefully doing something to delay transactions. They sure seem to accept my BTC deposits quickly.

Amir is right about most of this, but he comes too abrasive and in a manner just like how the old money expect proponents of a "geeky fake internet currency" to act. Therefore it feeds in to and helps their arguments against Bitcoin.
Agreed, Bitcoin needs a professional PR person.

I bought in at $5, sold only 10% of my holdings at the peak to get back my original investment and then some.
I guess that means I have about 90% confidence in bitcoin's success, which sounds about right ;)

Props to him for raising awareness of the antiquated and broken system and also causing a ton of people to ask "what the hell is a bitcoin?" He's obviously not going to win but he'll make a powerful statement. Cheers!

Good interview, but is it just me, or are most of these interviews about Bitcoin becoming awfully repetitive? I guess that's just an effect of me having so much interest in it. It's a great thing for newcomers, don't get me wrong.
