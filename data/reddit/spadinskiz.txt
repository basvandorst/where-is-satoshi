Only in can you seriously say the U.S. is a police state and have so many people agree with you. It's not a police state when you can (for the most part) protest the government as often and as much as you want in essentially any way that doesn't harm people without being prosecuted. You can cry police state all you want but most of the bad shit that happens is fairly isolated. I'm assuming that what you're talking about with considering citizens suspects is the NSA surveillance program and it's not really as simple as that. I would love to see the program end but it's not THAT bad. It's not like they're going after people who post "I hate Obama/the NSA/government policy" on the internet. Now *that* would be a police state.

Yeah but you'd probably have to leave the country and why would you want to leave the U.S.? It's not like $200k is going to get you a great living arrangement in any decent country, speaking of which the U.S. has loads of extradition treaties so your options are essentially limited to China, Russia, and the third world. Congratulations, you can now never return to the Western world without facing a prison sentence, all for the sum of a few years salary.

There's a difference between an exchange and a bank. An exchange is something you put money into for a small amount of time to make a purchase, usually a fairly small amount of money. A bank is something you put all of your money you don't invest into, most people keep 99% of their money in the bank. As such it's clear to see why one needs to be more trustworthy than the other.

You're joking right? If they don't sell all of the coins immediately, there will always be a threat looming over Bitcoin of an instant crash, since liquidating 15% of all Bitcoins would obviously destroy its value; if they do sell them immediately then we get a crash now and the media won't miss it.

Do you really think it's a good idea to tell jurors that they can just waive the law when their sole purpose is to make sure it's upheld? If you want laws to change then do what you can to change them, but promoting a bastardization of the law is a dangerous precedent and a flagrant violation of everything our justice system stands for. I agree that he shouldn't go to prison for what he did, but the way to achieve that is to talk to your congressmen and, if necessary, vote them out of office to change the laws you want changed.

 bitcoins

Perhaps when you go to register, they verify that you are a citizen, log your deposit address, and cross your name off the list of citizens to be issued voting-coins. However, they at no point actually mark which address is yours; doing so would be a crime. Then, once registration is done, they send out all the voter validation transactions.

That's really nice of you :) 
My favorite thing about bitcoin is that it has taught me a lot about economics. Before, I didn't know anything about currencies, now I feel like I know a lot more. 
Also it's pretty cool that as a sixteen year old I can make money by working for bitcoin. The closest place to work is an hour walk and I don't have a car. Every time I have tried to find work on the internet as a programmer or writer or anything, I had to have a credit card to qualify. Now I just need a bitcoin wallet and the motivation to work and I can make some money.
My least favorite is talking to people who absolutely refuse to even acknowledge the possibility that bitcoin could fail. They seem to think that bitcoin is going to be the next world currency and nothing could ever stop it. Actually I guess this is more of my least favorite thing about people, not bitcoin. People do this with everything, religion, politics, but other than that, I really like bitcoins.
Thanks for doing this!

It's a scam. The owner has been arrested for mass fraud (somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million IIRC) and part of his terms of release was (basically) to not start any companies. Even if BFL is legit, he might go back to prison before they come out, effectively shutting down BFL.
**EDIT** also there is evidence that they already have the ASICs and are using them to mine.

Yes, what DoxyDoxxx said.

Perhaps when you go to register, they verify that you are a citizen, log your deposit address, and cross your name off the list of citizens to be issued voting-coins. However, they at no point actually mark which address is yours; doing so would be a crime. Then, once registration is done, they send out all the voter validation transactions.

I found a cool minecraft server that gives you 5 mbtc to get people to sign up, 1 mbtc every 15 minutes, and it's a casino to boot!

I don't smoke but do these work with weed? Like hash oil or something.

I don't think you can hire an assassin for ~$150 but your point is still valid, its like saying people get arrested for using cash that a drug dealer spent at a supermarket and eventually got to them.

Don't think you can retrieve it but if you have Minecraft there are some servers that will give you more than that in like an hour.

I think we need new Bitcoin subreddits to lessen the clutter here.

That's a pretty fucking huge assumption

Dude we should email our insurance companies and ask them to accept Bitcoins...until we find a way to make a reliable one that is.

Are they just out of circulation forever? Couldn't this fuck up the Btc value since there is such a limited supply and it is so easy to lose an account(accidentally delete file or lose the PW)?

Hey I just have a quick question. I have a wordpress site but it's a free one so I don't have access to the code, just widgets. Every time I try to add an anonymous advertisement (bitcoin advertising thing) to a widget it just disappears from the text widget when I save it. The ad begins and ends with iclass tags. I know almost no HTML, so can you please tell me how to put the ad on my site through a widget?
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:27:35
Nononono, .15 BTC for the ability to tip in other subreddits.
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:54:56
I remember seeing bitcoin when I was twelve at really low prices when it came out and being sad that I couldn't buy any. I'm 16 now so I still can't buy any. Sucks knowing something might get really huge but you can't hop on it.
Might just get a job and buy some... 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:06:35
I don't understand your question; could you rephrase it?

Sort of, but you don't have to actually buy a card and the fee would be minimal or non existent. Just a means of easier trading.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:43:58
Those exchanges are just as terrible as they were yesterday. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:10:41

What I'm saying is we can make it so coins/wallets simply can not be tracked. There's no technical reason the blockchain has to keep a record of all the addresses of coins.
EDIT: I'm starting to realize that this is incorrect, but there is no technical reason that said data needs to be readable to humans.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:31:21
I actually had this idea earlier, though about making a Gamebattles type thing but for Bitcoins, I even made a subreddit for it so I could add stuff later tonight.

I just meant it as a general warning about asking for advice on the internet, not necessarily your post.
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:46:59
No, because that many bitcoins won't be mined for decades
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:52:13
Back to normal? It's over man. If its not over its not going back up for a long time.

If you'd done that a few years ago you'd have ~$100 today
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:55:04
I genuinely don't understand all the upset. Bitcoin is open source. If this becomes a thing and the Govt. decides to make it mandatory, we can just change Bitcoin so the addresses work differently and aren't as traceable. Problem solved.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:48:27
False. They're not free because they only send micro Bitcoins(BTC.000001) and have advertisements. They usually only require a wallet address, so spam is not possible except money spam. 
Even the sites that do require registration don't spam you. I signed up on a few of them just for the affiliate thing and I haven't gotten a single email other than the Email Confirmation ones.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:43
Right, because I said to pull it out.

That will almost certainly not happen. Maybe some currency can be the sole global currency some day, but almost definitely not soon and not bitcoin.

I understand the risks. Go back and read the rest of the post, I got scammed by Paypal itself, not one of their customers.

Wouldn't people be able to simply buy and sell their coins though? Say I am a pharmaceutical company and I make a legal agreement with bob to send him $5000 every year he lets me use his medical coin. Bob isn't a doctor, and he is young and healthy; why wouldn't he let me use his vote? Now that I have his coin and likely many others, I can veto regulations for pharmaceutical companies such as my own and provide unhealthy medicine.

You know the owner of BFL went to prison for fraud and as part of his release he isn't allowed to start any business where people pay and wait for a product? Bfl is most likely a scam and even if its not the owner might go to prison for breaking his terms of release.
