the downvoters need to understand that treating satoshi like an infallible religious leader is bad for bitcoin in the long run. there is no way a human back then could predict and plan for all the issues bitcoin is facing now. and it's well documented that his code, though a breakthrough, needed work before it could be called a high quality software project.

i have a fast connection, but a slow cpu on my bitcoin machine, and that cpu is maxed out during the initial sync, presumably verifying incoming blocks. so i'm guessing that in that kind of setup the cpu is the limiting factor. can someone corroborate/debunk this theory, as i've only ever seen answers that talk about slow downloading?

Since it took a while to load for me, here it is:
There is some recent confusion around Groupon’s intended use of a product name that the Gnome Foundation believes infringes on their trademarks.
We love open source at Groupon. We have open sourced a number of projects on Groupon github. Our relationship with the open source community is more important to us than a product name. We’ve been communicating with the Gnome Foundation for months to try to come to a mutually satisfactory resolution, including alternative branding options, and we’re happy to continue those conversations. And if we can’t come up with a resolution, we’ll be glad to look for another name.
We will continue to have an open line of communication with the Gnome Foundation until this matter is resolved.

i've been thinking along the same lines lately. i recall a study done not long after it became possible to buy a pizza on the internet, which put a person in a room with nothing but a computer connected to the internet, and the test was whether that person could get everything they needed to survive. to me, bitcoin seems to be in a similar place right now.
so much so, that next month instead of my usual investment i'll put in 50 euros more and try to spend that much btc over the month.

The info is in a file which is updated by a python/bash script that runs every 10 minutes via cron. It calls bitcoind getinfo and  for the global blockchain height. It also gets the bitcoind uptime using its /proc/$pid timestamp. A few lines of bash turns all that into a valid python expression (if you set false = False). The picture is made using PIL from a history of info files.
The web part is apache with mod_python (yuk! it should use wsgi instead) which simply renders the info file into a webpage.
There are other approaches, this quite unixy one works for me.

Thanks, so a colour == the satoshi was spent from a particular address. (It would be nice if the sales pitches I've been seeing were clearer about this.) Then a satoshi could have multiple colours. I wonder what an application of that might be.
I think tainted would be a more accurate name. Maybe not as good for PR.
* What happens if/when the number of decimal places increases? I guess the organiser would refuse entry unless you had enough of the coloured btc.
* The organiser could issue more tickets at any time? I suppose that's a place where trust comes in. Many events have staggered ticket issue already. This is actually cool.

@_date: 2015-05-08 06:37:42
Personally, this situation seems very familiar - I used to work at a company where the senior developers were quite technically conservative, much like the bitcoin devs who fear an increase block size. (They were also full of themselves.) I stuck with them for a while, as I am doing with bitcoin, but eventually my frustration level with the difficulty of innovation in such an environment forced me to call one incompetent and leave.
I do not want the same to happen with bitcoin - if it won't (notice how I didn't write can't) adapt, the MySpace analogy will be an accurate one.
Just remembered why I left MySpace - it was taking 30 seconds to log in.

The value of bitcoinj is ease of integration into higher-level Java software, and hackability for Java devs who find C/C++ too much work. A Python impl would be valuable for the same reasons, but like JS Python is maybe not such a suitable language performancewise.
I would argue that there is value in competing implementations provided the devs want correctness, as that way any vagueness in the published bitcoin protocol will need to be clarified.
Still, I can't see any way reimplementing core in JS is a good use of reddit's money.

It looks alright actually, but lots of editing needed to get it up to standard. For example I don't think Satoshi belongs in the opening paragraph, if readers care who invented bitcoin they can dig deeper. Stuff like "As of July 2013, the commercial use of bitcoin was small compared to its use by speculators" is old news and should be updated. So what did you think was "horrible" OP?

i have the connection anyway, it's one of the best consumer connections available and my provider keeps upgrading it for free, so no worries there. i also have the server anyway, it's an old one (1.5ghz, 2gb ram) so i won't mind getting a new one when bitcoind finally outgrows it. the interesting question is will bitcoind outgrow the new server before it's time to replace it for non-bitcoin reasons. i can't see any of the current bitcoin teams allowing resource usage to get so out of hand.

Simplicity would be having a search box so I can see e.g. how much money I'm spending at xyz.com - currently I have the luxury of asking for a date range, but that only goes back two months, never mind I can click on monthly statements, but they only go back 2 years. Oh and if I used my credit card then there are pdfs to download in addition to that.
Also, people don't care about one-stop applications as much as big business claims they do - they'll use whatever is worth more to them e.g. facebook&amp;twitter&amp;instagram versus g+.
