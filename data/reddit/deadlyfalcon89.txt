Oh honey... 80% of Americans would give you a "deer in the headlights" look if you asked them to just define "protocol", much less synthesize the use of such a word.

Gotta admit, when we finally graduated off our dial-up, it was the weirdest thing to have an always-on connection.  A decade later, and I feel almost ill if I *don't*.

I guess I don't really see the problem with using a position of (perceived) authority to endorse a relevant point of view.

Houses... cars... airplanes... Or, you know, you can keep renting your life and just never see that money again.

Well clearly, but then I wouldn't get the 1. 2. 3. ??? 4. Profit joke.

You and me both, buddy.  A friend and I thought about writing a BTC trader bot... turns out the algorithm would have been dead simple:
    btc=convert_dollars_to_btc(100);
    sleep_years(4);
    sell(btc);
    //TODO - ???
    profit();

More than that, why haven't they gone after car manufacturers?  Have they never heard of a hit and run?  Those things are dangerous and have no place on our streets!  /s

Well, if you never need a mortgage, you might be onto something.
