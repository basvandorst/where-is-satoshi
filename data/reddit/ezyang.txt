No, that doesn't work because you no longer have uniform input sizes, so you can trace based on variations in size. The transaction fee problem is a bit of a problem, in fact.

This is a big problem. One possibility is to not pay any fees: currently, there is a social convention that if all outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger, and so if we're not mixing too many addresses together, we can do the transaction for free. But once the intrinsic benefits of mining taper out, one would expect transaction costs to eventually become non-zero.
In this case, the transaction fee will have to be paid out of another wallet, not subtracted from the BTC involved in the transaction. Furthermore, this wallet must also be anonymous (e.g. to get anonymity, you must have some anonymity to begin with). But an important concern is how to pay for the transaction, when the size of Bitcoin you are anonymizing is about the same amount of the transaction cost anyway! One mitigating factor may be that it is really easy to find lots of participants willing to perform this mix, so a few benificient participants (who ostensibly want to be able to mix things) pay the entirety of the transaction fee for large, mini-mixes, and then uses the results of the mini-mix to pay for their bigger mixing.
Alternatively, we can solve the "cannot mix differing sizes of BTC" problem, but this seems hard.


That's the point: you don't get anonymity without network spam, the whole point of the exercise is to make the network more complicated. Also note that you exaggerate the number of splits necessary: since the denominations are powers of two, you are guaranteed to only need logarithmically many coins to get the precise transaction.


There are lots of DDOS attacks, not just this one. As pointed out, some amount of work is required on the mixer tracker operator's side to mitigate this, and other attacks.

This works but means you cannot re-mix the resulting coin.

That would be a best case scenario, yes. But it certainly won't be decentralized, and I wouldn't be very confident that there'd be "no disagreement." Too many knobs.

Off topic, sorry.

No, no, that was not the point. What I'm actually saying is that quantum computing is not a magical wand you wave at problems and have them be computed faster. You need *specific* quantum algorithms that speed up their classical counterparts.

As an anarchist, you should understand the power of a free market, and you should also understand why, economically speaking, a decentralized solution must be disruptive. It's something of a prisoner's dilemma. (I'm sorry if this feels like a bait-and-switch: if no one is able to force, via criminal law or other exertions of power, a particular protocol, then we're talking about the decentralized transition.) There is one bit of the argument that hasn't been addressed, which is the class of proposed solutions that bootstrap themselves on the old currency. I would like to see some analyses of that, but I suspect they too will be disruptive in the presence of competition.
Quibbles about your history: Y2K and IPv4-IPv6 are (arguably) of different character. I can easily demonstrate cases where hyperinflation have destroyed the value of a currency over night. Also, the IPv6 transition is *not* going well at all. It turns out, for security reasons, people don’t actually like the prospect of having all their machines publically addressable...

Yes. The point is making you realize that Bitcoin is not just a protocol. It's a protocol and the network of users using the protocol.

By your criteria, the representative democracy of the United States is "decentralized", because we all elect representatives to the government who then actually make laws for us. The libertarians and anarchists in the audience would object strongly!
Sure. If you realize that such a transition could be disruptive as hell, then I've done my job.

Define "Bitcoin" to not only mean the current protocol, but the succession of Bitcoin protocols which maintain economic continuity. (e.g. What people actually care about.) Then the title is completely correct.
@_date: 2011-06-01 16:04:20
You can certainly let the market decide. The point behind this post is not that there is no way of performing this transfer, but that there is no way to do this transfer non-disruptively. "Convincing others to use it instead" is very, very hard; you're more likely to end up with a fragmentation of the currency.

It's Skype, not Bitcoin, but both are distributed systems, and the lessons from one are fully applicable to another.

There are two senses in which the term Bitcoin is being used, and I'm certainly not helping. The sense intended here is:

Incorrect, I am not making such a strong statement. However, I am arguing that this *particular* circumstance cannot do the decentralized transition in a nondisruptive manner. Note that "nondisruptive" is a rather strong requirement, which I may think is reasonable given the amount of uptime people require of payment processing system.


Many of these protocols are standardized by committees; and there have been historic power struggles between companies seeking to embrace and extend these protocols and the wide wide masses.


Yes. I am acknowledging it as a point which I cannot argue.


I don't care if it's not a deal breaker for you; I do care if it's a deal breaker for the administrators of giant networks who are actually in a situation to do something about the transition.


Usually the bigger problem is open ports with insecure (or malicious) software behind them. In a NAT setup, it's nontrivial to directly access these ports.

In that case, you fail the non-disruptive test. When flag day comes, it will not be a simple matter of "upgrade the client, proceed business as usual."
@_date: 2011-06-01 12:23:59
Yes. While I was writing this article, I had an interesting discussion with a friend, who argued that, given the volatility of real currencies, a mad rush like the decentralized transition every half a century or so might not actually be so bad. Just make sure multiple currencies are floating at any given time, and hope that there is sufficient liquidity. But I think it's *absolutely absolutely* wrong to pretend that we only need to talk about the current Bitcoin protocol in isolation. That's not how economies work!

This is the "centralized" solution I describe in my post.

I would like to make a technical comment about quantum computers, which is that if they are feasible, they break many problems (e.g. factoring), but none which are relevant to widely used cryptographic hashes today.
Update: This is a little off; Grover's algorithm permits a quadratic reduction of preimage complexity.
